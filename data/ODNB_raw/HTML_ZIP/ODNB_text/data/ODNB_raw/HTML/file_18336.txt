<span class="headword">Matilda</span> <span class="st"> [Edith, Mold, Matilda of Scotland]</span>  (1080&#150;1118), <span class="occ">queen of England, first consort of Henry I</span>, was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17859/', "Malcolm III, king of Scots")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18044/', "Margaret")</script>, granddaughter of Edmund Ironside (<i>d</i>. 1016). She was born probably in the late summer or autumn of 1080, as her godfather, Robert Curthose (<i>d</i>. 1134), the eldest son of William I, was in Scotland then, but so far as is known at no other time. She was baptized Edith, but contemporaries knew her only as Matilda (or one of its variants). Her education was entrusted to her maternal aunt Christina, a nun who appears to have spent time at both Romsey and Wilton. The girl was compelled by her superiors to dress as a nun, and since visitors saw her wearing the habit, some assumed that she was a nun. During the summer of 1093 William II, Alan Rufus, count of Richmond, and her father all observed her wearing the veil. Malcolm was so angered that he snatched it from her head, declaring that he would rather see her married to Count Alan than a nun. His enigmatic outburst has created confusion over whether Malcolm had betrothed his daughter to the count, or whether the comment was intended sarcastically. Malcolm evidently took his daughter with him back to Scotland. Before the end of the year, however, Alan, Malcolm, and Margaret were all dead, and Donald (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1099), the new king of the Scots, drove most of Margaret's children out of his realm. Matilda found shelter in England with the help of King William and of her uncle, her mother's brother Edgar &AElig;theling. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1109), ordered the bishop of Salisbury to compel the &#145;lost daughter&#146; of the Scottish king to return to the monastery, but whether action was taken on this order is not known, nor are Matilda's whereabouts from 1093 to late 1100 ascertainable. During these years Earl William de Warenne (<i>d</i>. 1138) asked for her hand, but according to a contemporary chronicler, &#145;it was reserved for a loftier bridegroom&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 4.272).<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12948/', "Henry I")</script> was no sooner king, in August 1100, than he proposed to marry Matilda. There was, however, the question of Matilda's freedom for marriage, since Anselm considered her a runaway nun. Matilda approached the archbishop and told him her story; he and an assembly of bishops, nobles, and clergy decided, after careful inquiry, that she had never taken vows nor been pledged to the cloister, and was therefore free to marry. She received their verdict &#145;with a happy expression&#146;, and on 11 November 1100 Anselm performed the wedding and crowned her queen at Westminster Abbey. This marriage proved popular with Henry's English subjects, particularly within the city of London, and had the additional benefit of securing England's northern border through an alliance with the Scots. Matilda received a generous dower settlement. No accurate assessment of the wealth she controlled can be gleaned from the existing evidence, but records which include some twenty-five charters issued by the queen, do show that she controlled the abbeys of Waltham, Barking, and Malmesbury, lands in Rutland, and property in London, including the wharf that later became known as Queenhithe, and that she received the tolls of the city of Exeter. Her staff included two clerks who were promoted to bishoprics. One chronicler reports that Matilda was &#145;in childbed&#146; in Winchester in July 1101, when Curthose invaded England to press his rights to the throne. If so, she must have been in the early stages of the difficult pregnancy that resulted in the birth of a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18338/', "Matilda")</script>, near Abingdon in February 1102. A son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29453/', "William")</script>, was born late in 1103. Unreliable traditions posit the births and early deaths of other children; none of these is likely to be correct.<br>
<br>As queen, Matilda attended meetings of the king's council; she often chaired these meetings in Henry's absence. By 1103 Matilda had persuaded Robert Curthose to give up the pension from England secured to him by his treaty with Henry in 1101. She corresponded with many leading ecclesiastical figures during the investiture controversy, including Archbishop Anselm, Pope Paschal II (<i>r</i>. 1099&#150;1118) and bishops Ivo of Chartres, Marbod of Rennes, and Hildebert de Lavardin. A letter from the German emperor, Henry V, thanking her for efforts on his behalf, presumably refers to negotiations concerning the emperor's marriage to her daughter. Matilda evidently sympathized with the clergy who were taxed harshly in 1105, but declined to intercede on their behalf. On 15 August 1105 she was travelling through the kingdom and stopped for services at Abingdon. When Anselm returned from his three-year exile in 1106, she provided a personal welcome, and then rode ahead along his itinerary to secure comfortable lodgings and lead welcoming ceremonies. She visited Normandy in 1106 or 1107; while there she may have heard a guitar performance by Adelard of Bath. In 1111 she was present at the translation of St &AElig;thelwold's relics at Winchester. In 1112 Matilda travelled to Gloucester to witness the presentation of gifts to the monks there. In 1116, while in London, she ordered the release of an unjustly condemned prisoner. Later that year she chaired a council to deal with the issue of admitting papal legates in England, and on 28 December she attended the consecration of St Albans Abbey church.<br>
<br>Like her mother, Matilda was pious and practised bodily mortifications, especially during Lent. She was particularly interested in the care of lepers, and on one occasion washed and kissed the feet of a group of sufferers who had been invited into her chamber. She built a leper's hospital outside London and patronized several other institutions dedicated to their care. Matilda's interest in works of practical charity probably led to her patronage of the Augustinian canons. Working with Anselm, she established one of England's first Augustinian priories, Holy Trinity, Aldgate, in London. She was also an early patron of Merton Priory. Her good works included the construction of several bridges in Surrey and Essex and a public bathhouse at London's Queenhithe. Matilda is also known for her literary and musical interests. Several continental bishops addressed poetic elegies to her. She commissioned a biography of her mother, a genealogical account of the royal house of Wessex, and was most likely the patron of the Anglo-Norman version of the life of St Brendan. She may also have inspired and helped to pay for the writing of William of Malmesbury's <span class="italic">Deeds of the Kings of England</span>.<br>
<br>When Matilda died at Westminster on 1 May 1118, the canons of Holy Trinity and the monks of Westminster both claimed burial rights. She was interred in Westminster Abbey near the tombs of her relative Edward the Confessor and his queen. The occurrence of several &#145;signs and miracles&#146; at Matilda's tomb led to an early interest in the possibility of her sainthood, but the cult waned after the wreck of the <i>White Ship</i> and the accession of King Stephen. Despite William of Malmesbury's complaint that she allowed her bailiffs to fleece her tenants to provide funds for her patronage, she is, in English tradition, emphatically &#145;Mold the Good Queen&#146;. Not only was the Confessor's prophecy of the regrafting of the &#145;green tree&#146; fulfilled through her descendants, but chroniclers over and over again ascribe to her a direct, personal, and beneficial influence on the condition of England under Henry I.<br>
