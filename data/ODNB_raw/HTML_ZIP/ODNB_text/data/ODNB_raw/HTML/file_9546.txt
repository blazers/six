</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitzgerald, Lord  Edward</span>  (1763&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and army officer</span>, was born on 15 October 1763 in London, the twelfth of nineteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9565/', "James Fitzgerald, first duke of Leinster (1722&#150;1773)")</script>, and his wife, Emily Mary (1731&#150;1814) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48893/', "Fitzgerald, Emilia Mary, duchess of Leinster")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16450/', "Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond")</script>, and his wife, Sarah. Lord Edward arrived in Ireland as an infant the year after his birth and by 1768 was being educated at the Rousseau-inspired family school at Frascati in Blackrock under William Ogilvie. On the death of the first duke of Leinster in 1773, Emily Fitzgerald and Ogilvie, who was her long-time lover, went to France with most of the children. They settled first in Marseilles and in 1776 moved to the duke of Richmond's ch&acirc;teau at Aubigny. Lord Edward's military career commenced in 1776 when he briefly attended a military academy in Paris. Two years later a lieutenant's command in the 96th foot was bought on his behalf. However he was not permitted to leave home until 1779 when he joined the Sussex militia in southern England. The following year he decided that the unit, commanded by his uncle the duke of Richmond, would not advance his military career, and he entered the 96th foot then stationed in Youghal, co. Cork. By February 1781 he had changed to a regiment preparing to sail for America, where he gained active military experience for the first time. However, only a few months after arriving at Charles Town Lord Edward was seriously injured in an engagement at Eutaw Springs, and probably owed his life to the intervention of a local former slave called Tony Small, who carried him from the battlefield. He recovered from his injuries and in 1782 purchased a majority in the 90th infantry regiment, but the unit was ordered home. Fitzgerald was accompanied by Tony Small, who became a loyal servant.<br>
<br>On his return from America Fitzgerald was elected MP for the borough of Athy in co. Kildare on the Leinster interest, now controlled by his brother, the second duke. In political circles he strongly aligned himself with his first cousin Charles James Fox and the Irish patriot grouping. During the mid-1780s he appears to have been uncertain about his future, and travelled frequently between Ireland and England, as well as continental Europe in 1787. Moreover, he realized the difficulty of his position as a minor aristocratic figure and was disappointed romantically. In 1788, probably in a bid to improve his military and social prospects, he changed regiment again and sailed for British North America. While camped at Halifax and New Brunswick he was impressed by the self-sufficiency of the settler society, noting in a letter to his mother:<blockquote>The equality of everybody and of their manner of life I like very much. There are no gentlemen; everybody is on a footing, provided he works, and wants nothing; every man is exactly what he can make himself, or <i>has</i> made himself by industry. (Moore, 62)</blockquote>Even more revealing for a man imbued with Rousseau's notion of the noble savage was Fitzgerald's interaction with Native Americans. While on a trek south towards New Orleans in 1789 he was formally accepted as a chieftain of the Seneca, one of the Iroquois nations.<br>
<br>By the following year Fitzgerald was back in London and during the subsequent decade became more actively engaged with the growing radicalism of the period. Further promotion within the army was unfeasible after Fitzgerald was elected MP for co. Kildare in 1790 and he decided to remain in the opposition ranks. His own growing political awareness was given political articulation and indeed accentuated by his interaction with the small circle of radicals in England centred on Thomas Paine. Through the same group he met and began an affair with the musician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25364/', "Elizabeth Linley (1754&#150;1792)")</script>, wife of the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She died of consumption on 28 June 1792 shortly after giving birth to Fitzgerald's daughter, Mary, who died in infancy in the care of Sheridan. The growing hostility to the increasingly small number of pro-French radicals in England resulted in Paine's flight to the birthplace of the revolution. Fitzgerald visited France in October 1792 and was highly impressed by the revolution. Moreover, he became closely attached to Paine, with whom he lodged in Paris. In November 1792, at White's Hotel, he renounced his noble title in public and increasingly adopted the outward trappings of revolutionary fashions. His inflammatory Francophile stance resulted in his being cashiered from the army, which left him without a profession. On leaving France Fitzgerald cemented his revolutionary enthusiasm by marrying on 27 December 1792 Pamela (1776?&#150;1831) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9580/', "Fitzgerald, Pamela")</script>], daughter of the educationist Madame de Genlis and reputedly the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, who had renamed himself Philippe Egalit&eacute; and was regarded as an aristocratic pariah outside France. Pamela's origins continue to confuse historians, but the effect of Fitzgerald's marriage was unmistakable, and signalled his radical ardour. The couple subsequently had three children, Edward Fox, Pamela, and Lucy Louisa.<br>
<br>On the Fitzgeralds' return to Ireland in January 1793 they became a focal point of radical chic, though seasoned reformers viewed Fitzgerald with some misapprehension. Nicholas Murphy, a sympathizer, in whose house Fitzgerald lodged before his final capture, described him at this time as follows: &#145;He was, I believe, about 5 feet, 7 inches in height, and had a very interesting countenance, beautiful arched eyebrows, fine grey eyes, handsome nose, and high forehead, thick, dark coloured hair, brown or inclining to black&#146;  (Moore, 434). In parliament Fitzgerald carved out a reputation as an extremist. Most famously, at a debate which banned an assembly of the politically driven Dublin Volunteers, he exclaimed: &#145;Sir I give my most hearty disapprobation to this address, for I do think the Lord Lieutenant and the majority of this house are the worst subjects the king has&#146;  (ibid., 163&#150;4). The statement drew the wrath of the members and he was forced to make two apologies before finally being readmitted to the house. Increasing disillusionment with the effectiveness of parliamentary opposition helped drive him towards the active revolutionary option as the only solution to Irish inequality. In 1794 he and Pamela moved to a house in Kildare town, near his estate at Kilrush. From this base he gradually developed a warm rapport with the lower orders in which he was to place his political aspirations. However, from 1794 it is more difficult to ascertain what Fitzgerald was doing; those letters which survive are markedly apolitical in tone. In Kildare, lower order Defender disturbances re-emerged during 1796, signalling a rapprochement with the expanding United Irishmen. The stature of the Geraldine family in Kildare placed Fitzgerald in an ideal position in which to organize the underground movement in the county. James Alexander's sister commented that in 1796 &#145;his lordship resided in Kildare, danced among the rustics at bonfires and in short conducted himself with such condescension, freedom and affability that &hellip; he stole away the hearts of the people&#146;  (Alexander, 22). By the following year a strong county-wide United Irish organization had emerged centred on Fitzgerald, who surrounded himself by local radicals such as the apothecary George Cummins.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1796 Fitzgerald travelled to Hamburg with his equally well-connected companion, Arthur O'Connor, with the intention of seeking French assistance for an Irish rising. By now Fitzgerald's Orleanist connections worked against him; therefore O'Connor alone negotiated with Hoche. It was probably on his return to Ireland in late 1796 that Fitzgerald formally joined the republican and separatist Society of United Irishmen. His home at Kildare town continued to act as a centre of radical activity, as recorded in the diary of Fitzgerald's radical younger sister Lucy. He travelled to Belfast with O'Connor during early 1797, now more closely under the scrutiny of the Dublin administration. By mid-1797 the parliamentary opposition had relinquished all hope of effecting change in Ireland or England, and Fitzgerald announced to the electors of co. Kildare that he would not stand for re-election. Most of his time was occupied developing the growing United Irish organization, particularly since he was the group's most important experienced militarist. A crucial mistake was made, however, during 1797 when he invited Thomas Reynolds, a Catholic merchant, to replace him as colonel of the United Irish forces in Kilkea and Moone barony in south Kildare. This decision appears to mark a general retreat by Fitzgerald from his Kildare base towards Dublin, but, in fact, Reynolds was a lukewarm radical who quickly furnished the government with information on United Irish meetings, resulting in the capture of almost the entire Leinster directory on 12 March 1798. Fitzgerald evaded capture but was henceforth forced to remain in hiding, largely in Dublin, though he continued to meet Reynolds.<br>
<br>The arrests in Dublin contributed to the decision to proceed with an indigenous rising. Fitzgerald was suddenly placed at the heart of this endeavour and took steps for what he hoped would be a swift <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> centred on Dublin, supported by the surrounding counties. His high profile and aristocratic background placed the government in a difficult position, and discreet offers were made to encourage him to leave the country. However, he remained in hiding in Dublin, moving from house to house and meeting United Irish leaders. On 11 May the government belatedly offered a reward of &pound;1000 for his capture. One week later Fitzgerald narrowly avoided arrest and was subsequently lodged at the house of a feather merchant called Nicholas Murphy. However, the following day, 19 May, the authorities finally caught up with Fitzgerald as he lay on an upstairs bed. In the ensuing struggle Fitzgerald mortally wounded Captain Ryan before being shot in the shoulder by Major Sirr. The identity of Lord Edward's betrayer remained a complete mystery until the second half of the nineteenth century, when W. J. Fitzpatrick demonstrated that the United Irish sympathizer and barrister Francis Magan had relayed the information concerning Fitzgerald's whereabouts to Dublin Castle through the notorious spymaster Francis Higgins. Fitzgerald was imprisoned in Newgate gaol, Dublin, and his wounds were initially considered not to be serious. Samuel Neilson and others made a futile attempt to rescue him in the hours before the rebellion he had planned broke out on 24 May 1798, indicating the aristocrat's perceived centrality as a figurehead and leader. Fitzgerald's wounds gradually became infected but no decision was taken to attempt to remove the bullets which had lodged in his shoulder. His brother Lord Henry and his aunt Lady Louisa Conolly were permitted to see him in early June. Gradually his body was wracked by septicaemia and as a result he died in his cell on 4 June 1798. As rebellion raged in the country, and with security extremely tight in Dublin, Fitzgerald was quietly buried in the crypt of St Werburgh's Church, Dublin. Despite the protests of the duke of Leinster, the government passed an act of attainder against Lord Edward, depriving his immediate family of his testament, though William Ogilvie was permitted to purchase his Kilrush estate.<br>
<br>Lord Edward Fitzgerald's heroic reputation was established by Thomas Moore's biography, published in 1831. Moore presented him as a romantic nationalist rather than a committed revolutionary republican. Fitzgerald's lack of political publications, the fact that much of his correspondence was not available, and his dramatic and tragic history allowed this interpretation to remain central and the profusion of twentieth-century biographies concentrated on the romantic Fitzgerald. The reality was that Fitzgerald was at the heart of the revolutionary plans of the United Irishmen by May 1798, as their key militarist and one of the few figureheads who remained at large and committed to an Irish rising. His arrest and death did not cause the failure of the Irish insurrection in 1798 but his leadership of the attempt might have produced a very different series of events.<br>
