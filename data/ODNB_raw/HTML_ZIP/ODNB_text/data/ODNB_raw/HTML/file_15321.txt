<span class="headword">Kemble,  John Mitchell</span>  (1807&#150;1857), <span class="occ">philologist and historian</span>, was born on 2 April 1807, the elder surviving son of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15316/', "Charles Kemble (1775&#150;1854)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15323/', "Maria Theresa Kemble, n&#233;e De Camp (1777&#150;1838)")</script>. He was a nephew of John Philip Kemble (1757&#150;1823) and of Sarah Siddons (1755&#150;1831), and a brother of the singer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15315/', "Adelaide Kemble")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15318/', "Frances Anne (Fanny) Kemble (1809&#150;1893)")</script>, an actress and writer, whose <span class="italic">Record of a Girlhood</span> provides lively glimpses of his youth. Kemble's early passion for grammar and language, kindled by his father and his uncle John, was reinforced by his early education at the school run by the lexicographer Charles Richardson at Clapham. As a boy he acquired a taste for chemistry, and enjoyed making toy theatres, and acting plays with Fanny. He then went to King Edmund's Grammar School at Bury St Edmunds, under Dr Benjamin Heath Malkin, where among his contemporaries were Malkin's son Frederick, Edward FitzGerald, James Spedding (the later biographer of Bacon), and William Bodham Donne, Kemble's lifelong friend. In June 1824 he was admitted as a pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, but did not go into residence until the Michaelmas term of 1825. He held a Hewer exhibition from his school and great things were expected of him.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Kemble's enthusiasm for rifle-shooting, rowing, and fencing was matched by the attractions of speaking in the union club (of which he was president in Lent 1828) and the private debating society. His fine physique, handsome appearance, expressive voice, and brilliant talk made him extremely popular. He contributed verse and prose to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and in 1826 became a member of the celebrated Apostles (officially the Cambridge Conversazione Society, founded in 1820). His friends, here and later, included, according to Fanny, &#145;Arthur Hallam, Alfred Tennyson and his brothers, Frederick Maurice, John Sterling, Richard Trench, William Bodham Donne, the Romillys, the Malkins, Edward FitzGerald, James Spedding, William Thackeray and Richard Monkton Milnes&#146;  (Kemble, <span class="italic">Record</span>, 1.299). Eleven of these were Apostles, who exalted liberalism, imagination, and friendship, maintained by annual dinners and copious correspondence.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Kemble's strongly independent spirit was shown in his neglect of mathematics, his devotion to language studies, and his passionate involvement in radical politics, including a &#145;fanatical admiration for Jeremy Bentham, and Mill&#146;  (Kemble, <span class="italic">Record</span>, 1.293). He entered at the Inner Temple in June 1827 and worked alongside F. D. Maurice but confined his studies to those parts of English law that illustrated history or ancient customs. This academic independence and his reference to Paley as &#145;a miserable sophist&#146; and to Locke's &#145;loathsome infidelity&#146; led the Cambridge examiners early in 1829 to defer his degree. During the long vacation of 1829 he visited Germany with his Trinity friend Charles Barton, and having left him at Heidelberg went on to Munich and the Tyrol, and began a serious study of German philology. In early 1830 Kemble was impelled to return home, partly by reading of Fanny's triumph as Juliet (in a successful bid to rescue the desperate family fortunes), and partly by his father's securing for him an opportunity in the church. He took his degree on 25 February, rejected a career at the bar, and determined to take orders (an aspiration pleasing to Fanny and to his father), but found he would have to wait for divinity lectures until the Michaelmas term. He spoke frequently in the union, and in March acted Dogberry in <span class="italic">Much Ado</span>, with Hallam as Verges and Milnes as Beatrice. Kemble's priestly aspiration prompted Tennyson's sonnet &#145;To J.M.K.&#146;, which sees him as &#145;a latter Luther, and a soldier-priest&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Poems of Tennyson</span>, ed. C. Ricks, 1972, 1.280). In July 1830, however, he joined an ill-fated Spanish expedition designed to topple Ferdinand VII, launched by Sterling's cousin, John Boyd, Richard Chenevix Trench, and other young Englishmen. (The affair is described in Thomas Carlyle's <span class="italic">Life of John Sterling</span>, ix, x, xiii.) By October, Kemble was with Trench in Gibraltar, where he spent his leisure discussing German metaphysics. From the beginning the uprising was a miserable failure; Trench returned in February 1831. Kemble held on another three months but returned to London on 21 May. Eventually, in December 1831, Torrijos and fifty-two of his followers, including John Boyd, were captured and shot.<br>
<br>Having abandoned his idea of taking orders, Kemble spent the period from Michaelmas 1832 to the summer of 1835 mostly in Cambridge, &#145;acquiring a more intimate knowledge of the manuscript sources for Old English literature and history than any scholar had since Wanley&#146;  (Dickins, 11). His vacations were spent in the British Museum, where he studied Jacob Grimm's <span class="italic">Deutsche Grammatik</span>. He opened his academic career with a somewhat premature edition of <span class="italic">Beowulf</span> (1833), and in 1834 personally arranged a course of language lectures at Cambridge. His enthusiasm and eloquence initially attracted a large audience, but his Germanic rigour deterred all but the more serious students. In a review of Benjamin Thorpe's <span class="italic">Analecta Anglo-Saxonica</span> (which he commended), he launched a scathing but intemperate attack on the current state of Anglo-Saxon studies in Oxford, complaining of its &#145;idle and ignorant scholars&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1834, 1.391). This provoked a caustic counter-attack in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Anglo-Saxon Meteor</span>, possibly emanating from the Netherlands and Joseph Bosworth, in which Kemble's credentials are questioned and he is depicted as slavishly following the Danes and the Germans. Letters by Sir Frederick Madden and Dr Ingram continued the controversy (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1834, 2.483; 1835, 3.43). Bosworth's detailed attack on Kemble's treatment of verbs was not well based and Kemble's reputation survived. Yet Kemble's career prospects were fatally blighted. No professorship of Anglo-Saxon was forthcoming, and at Cambridge he later failed to obtain the post of principal librarian, and that of regius professor of modern history.<br>
<br>Kemble wrote to Jacob Grimm on 30 June 1832, opening a scholarly correspondence which lasted until 1852, and in August 1834 spent three weeks with him in G&ouml;ttingen, Grimm finding him very learned in the Anglo-Saxon tongue. On this visit he met his future wife, Natalie Auguste (<i>d</i>. after 1857), daughter of Professor Amadeus Wendt (1783&#150;1836) and Henriette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> D&ouml;litzch (1789&#150;1859). In March 1835 Kemble wrote to her father, asking for Natalie's hand in marriage, and on a later visit he married her by special licence in a Lutheran house ceremony at G&ouml;ttingen on 24 July 1836  (Wiley, 12). They had three children: Gertrude, who was to marry Charles Santley, the singer; Henry Charles, who later became a colonel in the 2nd Bengal cavalry; and Mildred, who became the first wife of the Revd C. E. Donne, son of her father's friend.<br>
<br>Since 1836 Kemble had deputized for his ailing father as examiner of plays, and in 1840 he was appointed to this post, which he held until his death. Kemble was then living in London, engaged in literary work, and researching, in the British Museum and various college and cathedral libraries, the Anglo-Saxon charters that formed the basis of his major work, the <span class="italic">Codex diplomaticus</span> (6 vols., 1839&#150;48), containing over 1400 documents. This was a foundational work, which well displays Kemble's mastery of Anglo-Saxon and his skill in deciphering documents. It provided the sound basis for his next and most popular major work, <span class="italic">The Saxons in England</span> (2 vols., 1849). This had its faults, but benefited from Kemble's ability to relate his findings to the work of German scholars on other branches of the Germanic family of languages.<br>
<br>For its first few years Kemble's marriage appears to have been happy, but in 1847 he parted from his wife. In letters to Grimm he attributes this to drunkenness and repeated adultery on her part  (Wiley, 31&#150;3, 36). At this time he was living with his children in a small house near Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire and was advertising for pupils, since he was earning little from his publications. These were to include many editions and translations of Anglo-Saxon texts and a variety of articles in such periodicals as the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Review</span> (which he edited from 1835 to 1844), <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, and latterly <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. This editorship, which he used to foster the work of his friends, brought him &pound;400 a year, and when it ended he was in dire poverty. The Apostles rallied to his support and paid the premium of his life insurance policy, but he had to sell his library.<br>
<br>From 1848 Kemble moved to Hanover, seeking a divorce, which presumably he obtained. (The records were destroyed in wartime action.) He delegated his duties as examiner to Bodham Donne, who performed them gratis. Donne became acting examiner in 1849, and succeeded to the post in 1857. At Hanover in 1854 Kemble turned his attention to prehistoric archaeology, and rearranged and catalogued the collections in the Royal Museum, the curators of which employed him for five months to excavate funeral barrows on L&uuml;neburg Heath and its environs. He took to archaeology ardently and, though untutored as a draughtsman, rapidly acquired the requisite skills. He made a large number of careful drawings of prehistoric antiquities in the museums of Munich, Berlin, and Schwerin. By this time he was a member of numerous European learned societies. On his return to England he sent accounts of his discoveries to the Society of Antiquaries and the Archaeological Institute, and issued the prospectus of a book to be published by subscription, with the title <span class="italic">Horae ferales</span>. This was intended to provide a systematic account of northern archaeology, and supply the means of relating it to other ages and countries.<br>
<br>At this point the committee of the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition employed Kemble to collect and arrange Celtic and Roman antiquities, and in February 1857 he delivered an address, &#145;On the utility of antiquarian collections&#146;, before the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. While there he caught cold, developed an inflammation of the lungs, and died at the Gresham Hotel on 26 March 1857. He was buried in the cemetery of Mount Jerome. His wife survived him for some years. Several Apostles contributed to a fund for the care of his children. It remained for R. G. Latham to edit <span class="italic">Horae ferales</span> from Kemble's incomplete papers. The work appeared in 1863, with an introduction by A. W. Franks to the splendid collection of plates, along with translations of Kemble's lecture at the opening of the Hanoverian Museum, and his address to the Royal Irish Academy.<br>
