<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and tutor</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13306/', "Thomas Hill (c.1628&#150;1677)")</script>, curate of Shuttington, Warwickshire, who refused to conform in 1662. He probably received his early education from Samuel Shaw, master of Ashby grammar school, who had been at school with his father. He was educated for the nonconformist ministry at John Woodhouse's academy at Sheriffhales, Shropshire, but &#145;through want of subsistence has beene forced &hellip; to quitt&#146;  (Presbyterian Fund board minutes, fol. 79<i>r</i>). With a grant of &pound;8 a year from the Presbyterian Fund (1692&#150;3) he resumed his studies with Woodhouse. He received a gift of books under Richard Baxter's will in 1693, at which time he was living at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, probably with Shaw, whose will Hill witnessed.<br>
<br>Hill was ordained at Nottingham on 7 April 1703 by ten Presbyterian ministers. At the time he was minister of Findern, 4 miles south-west of Derby. He later also supplied Alvaston (<i>c</i>.1711&#150;20). From about 1710 he conducted an academy in Derby preparing students for the nonconformist ministry, which some time after 1714 was removed to Hartshorne (between Ashby and Derby) and finally to Findern. In common with most other nonconformist tutors in this period he was harassed, and in August 1712 presented at the assizes for keeping a school in Derby &#145;for the boarding of youth&#146; without a licence. The prosecution was initiated by the master of the free school. In his defence, Hill stated that &#145;I board young men; I advise them what books to read; and when they apply to me for information on anything they do not understand, I inform them&#146;  (McLachlan, &#145;Ebenezer Latham&#146;, 150). The case was dismissed.<br>
<br>From the textbooks Hill recommended, in particular the Newtonian Le Clerc's work on logic and the Cartesian Rohault on physics, he was clearly open to the latest scholarship. Nevertheless, they were the texts that John Woodhouse had employed. The use of Richard Baxter's <span class="italic">An End of Doctrinal Controversies</span> (1691) suggests Hill favoured Baxter's &#145;middle way&#146;. Whether modern languages were taught is unclear, but in 1715 Hill published a collection of psalms in Latin and Greek verse which his students were expected to sing, which also indicates an unusual interest in music. The names of twenty-two students are known (there were &#145;many more&#146;), of whom the most distinguished was John Taylor, the Hebraist and future principal of Warrington Academy, who migrated from Thomas Dixon's academy at Whitehaven. Hill died on 2 March 1720 at Findern, where he was buried on 5 March. After his death the academy was continued by Ebenezer Latham, who may previously have served as his assistant. Under Latham, the academy became one of the leading academies educating students on liberal theological principles.<br>
