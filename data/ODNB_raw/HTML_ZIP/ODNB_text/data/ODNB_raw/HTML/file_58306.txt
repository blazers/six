<span class="headword">Lorimer,  David Lockhart Robertson</span>  (1876&#150;1962), <span class="occ">diplomatist and linguist</span>, was born in the Free Church manse, Strathmartine, near Dundee, on 24 December 1876, the son of Robert Lorimer, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Isabella Lockhart Cornish Robertson. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38933/', "John Gordon Lorimer (1870&#150;1914)")</script>, who became an administrator in India. Educated at Dundee high school, David Lorimer entered the Indian army in 1896. After seven years attached to different regiments he was seconded to the political department of the government of India, and spent most of the rest of his professional life as a vice-consul, consul, or political agent in various parts of the Persian Gulf and (after 1920) on the north-west frontier of British India. In the course of his time as vice-consul for Khuzestan (at Ahvaz between 1903 and 1909) he developed a close friendship with the semi-independent ruler of the region, the wali of Posht-e-Kuh, which proved politically useful at the time of the British occupation of Iraq in the First World War.<br>
<br>After marrying <a href="#cosubject_76723">Emily Overend [<i>see below</i>]</a> in 1910, Lorimer served in Bahrain, Kerman, and &#145;Amara in lower Iraq between 1911 and 1920; he was created CIE in 1917. After the war the Lorimers returned to India, where David Lorimer spent four years as political agent in Gilgit. He retired from the service in 1927, and the Lorimers spent most of the rest of their lives in Welwyn Garden City. They had an adopted daughter.<br>
<br>David Lorimer is best known for a number of descriptive grammars of some of the languages spoken in or around the north-west frontier of India, the area that is now northern Kashmir and northern Pakistan. As one of his obituarists remarked, &#145;From the very beginning of his career the study of the life and languages of the various peoples among whom chance led him to work provided him with a &#147;spare time&#148; interest which was to last throughout his life&#146;  (Mackenzie, 181&#150;2). Either by himself or with his wife, he published a dozen books of descriptive grammar and dialectology on Pashtu (1915), Badakshani and Bakhtiari (1919), Dumaki (1939), Werchikwar (1962), and Burushaski (3 vols., 1935 and 1938), a &#145;philologically unconnected language&#146;  (ibid.). He was awarded one of the first Leverhulme research fellowships to visit Hunza to work on Burushaski from 1933 to 1935.<br>
<br>Lorimer was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and, jointly with his wife, was awarded the Burton medal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1948. During the Second World War he assisted with postal censorship, and also became associated with the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London, which appointed him an honorary fellow in 1953. Lorimer died in Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, Welwyn Garden City, on 26 February 1962. He bequeathed his large collection of linguistic materials, slides, photographs, cine films, and other materials to the library of the School of Oriental and African Studies (PP MS 60), where it remains. The University of Copenhagen published a three-volume study on Bahktiari ethnography, poetry, and linguistics based on this collection: <span class="italic">West Iranian Dialect Materials: from the Collection of D. L. Lorimer</span>, edited by F. Vahman and G. S. Asatrian (1987&#150;95).<br>
<br>Lorimer had been predeceased by his wife, <a name="cosubject_76723"></a><span class="headword">Emily Martha Lorimer <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Overend]</span></span>  (1881&#150;1949)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Dublin on 10 August 1881, the daughter of Thomas George Overend (1846&#150;1915), county court judge and recorder of Londonderry. Educated at Alexandra School and Alexandra College, Dublin, she graduated from the Royal University of Ireland in 1904 with first-class honours in French and German. After studying in Paris and G&ouml;ttingen she entered Somerville College, Oxford, and took first-class honours in German in 1906, remaining there as tutor in Germanic philology until her marriage to David Lorimer. She collaborated in his work on Persian dialects and the languages of the north-west frontier of India.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Emily Lorimer was director of the Red Cross missing and wounded enquiry department in Egypt. In 1916 Emily and David Lorimer were posted to Mesopotamia: while her husband was political officer at &#145;Amara, Emily edited the <span class="italic">Basra Times</span> (1916&#150;17). In 1917 she was mentioned in dispatches from Mesopotamia and was appointed OBE in the same year. On their return to England from India in 1927, she became a deputy commissioner of the Girl Guides (1927&#150;30) and spent a year (1930&#150;31) as acting warden of Bedford College House, University of London. She was correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the expedition with her husband to Hunza (1933&#150;5), of which she wrote a vivid account for the general reader entitled <span class="italic">Language Hunting in the Karakoram</span> (1939). She translated numerous German works (publishing under the name Emily Overend Lorimer), including Hitler's <span class="italic">Mein Kampf</span> which appeared as a <span class="roman">Penguin Special</span>, <span class="italic">What Hitler Wants</span> (1939). Like her husband she worked during the Second World War on postal censorship. She died in the Cottage Hospital, Welwyn Garden City, on 10 June 1949.<br>
