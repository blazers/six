<span class="headword">Courtenay,  Thomas</span>, thirteenth earl of Devon  (1414&#150;1458), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only surviving child and heir of Hugh Courtenay, twelfth earl of Devon (<i>d</i>. 1422), and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1441), daughter of Richard, Lord Talbot. He married Margaret, a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1861/', "John Beaufort, marquess of Dorset and of Somerset (c.1371&#150;1410)")</script>, and had with her three sons&#151;<a href="#cosubject_64963">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who succeeded as earl, and Henry and John, who both died unmarried&#151;and a daughter of Elizabeth who married the royal servant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109666/', "Hugh Conway")</script> at some date before 1487.<br>
<br>At the time of the twelfth earl's death the earldom of Devon was the single largest secular estate in that county. With lands concentrated in the southern and central parts of Devon, but with significant outliers in neighbouring counties, the earls enjoyed an annual landed income of about &pound;1500 net in the later middle ages. These extensive estates, together with the family's comital status&#151;restored to the Courtenay family in 1335, and held in conjunction with the honours of Plympton and Okehampton&#151;gave the earls considerable political authority in the region. On a national scale, however, the Courtenay earls of Devon were among the poorest families of their rank.<br>
<br>Thomas Courtenay's father had been one of Henry V's most active wartime commanders, and spent almost all his brief period as earl of Devon (1419&#150;22) on service overseas. When Thomas, after a long minority, aged eighteen and already a father, was given leave to enter his estates in February 1433, they represented barely half the full resources of the earldom. Not only did his mother, Countess Anne, enjoy her customary dowager third of the estate, but Earl Hugh had also entailed various other lands upon her. She lived until 1441 and occupied the chief seat of the earldom&#151;Tiverton Castle, Devon, recently renovated by Thomas's grandfather&#151;forcing Thomas himself to dwell in a secondary seat not far away at Colcombe, near Colyton.<br>
<br>Longer-term factors also exacerbated the situation. A significant redistribution of landed wealth within the upper echelons of west-country society had taken place since the late fourteenth century, and this meant that by 1441 the earl of Devon no longer possessed the clear ascendancy enjoyed by his predecessors. He was now challenged as a local source of patronage by a number of ambitious gentry families who enjoyed estates comparable in value to his own. Some of these families were elevated to the peerage during the course of the fifteenth century, such as the Brookes (lords Cobham), the Dynhams, and, pre-eminent among them, the Bonvilles. This local background helps explain Earl Thomas's response to national political developments. Henry VI's rule in the 1440s and 1450s, marked by drift and factionalism, served in the west country as elsewhere to inflame already heightened regional tensions.<br>
<br>Despite these disadvantages, alliances forged earlier by his father served Devon well at first. It is probable that the eight-year-old Thomas had been placed in the care of his future wife's family, the Beauforts, in 1422. His career in the late 1420s and 1430s followed the conventional pattern for a young aristocrat of the period&#151;knighted in November 1429, he received numerous grants, saw military service abroad, and was appointed to commissions of the peace in the west country.<br>
<br>As political life polarized in the late 1430s and 1440s, Devon's connection with the Beaufort clique began to pay dividends. More grants followed, and in May 1441 he was appointed steward of the duchy of Cornwall&#151;a blunder on the part of the government, since Bonville had been granted an almost identical post some years earlier which he still held. Nor were the benefits Devon acquired exclusively local for, in May 1445, he was appointed steward of England at the coronation of Queen Margaret&#151;a well-orchestrated demonstration of the Beaufort family's power at court.<br>
<br>But an attachment to the Beaufort faction also carried risks. As it began to lose ground at court in the face of the growing influence of the duke of Suffolk's circle (to which Bonville was connected), so Devon came to be excluded from access to royal patronage. He did not help himself: aided and abetted by his Beaufort kinsmen, his struggle with Bonville for the stewardship of the duchy of Cornwall had turned violent enough to alarm the government in 1441, and (unlike Bonville) Devon refused to serve abroad in March 1443, hoping rather to strengthen his position at home. He was later to see action at Pont-l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, Normandy, in 1446, however, and after the death of Cardinal Beaufort in the summer of 1447 he began to attend court more regularly. The government attempted to deal even-handedly with both Devon and Bonville, but the former continued to lose ground to his rival, who was elevated to the peerage at the parliament of 1449 when, significantly, Devon suffered the indignity of losing his claim of parliamentary precedence over the earl of Arundel.<br>
<br>Bonville's continued favour at court under Suffolk and, after the latter's death in 1450, the earl of Somerset, did not immediately undermine Devon's local power base in the south-west, and his control over the Devon electorate remained strong throughout 1449 and 1450. Devon's growing attachment to the duke of York enhanced his own authority; his and York's troops briefly controlled London in the last months of 1450, during York's display of strength on his return from Wales to challenge Henry VI's advisers, and Devon used his connection with York to challenge Bonville and his friends in the field. Most local gentry kept their heads down when events turned violent, but the forces mobilized by the earl of Devon in the west country, ostensibly in support of York, still contained a respectable gentry contingent. His military campaign against Bonville almost succeeded in catching his prey, but ultimately led to humiliation and temporary imprisonment following York's submission to Henry VI at Dartford (March 1452). The ensuing eighteen months of exclusion from court irreversibly undermined Devon's hold on power in the localities.<br>
<br>Bonville used the period to good effect, and the local parliamentary returns and appointments to commissions favoured his associates and sucked the life out of Devon's &#145;connection&#146;. The uncertainties that resulted from Henry VI's sudden insanity in July 1453, and the political crisis that followed, prompted Bonville to strengthen his forces both on land and at sea, and helped bring about Devon's indictment on a charge of treason. His acquittal cleared the path for York's appointment as protector (March 1454), but Bonville had so effectively entrenched himself in the west country that York had little alternative but to retain his services there.<br>
<br>Although Earl Thomas attended a number of council meetings, his greatest energies were directed towards bolstering his position at home. Law and order in Devon deteriorated alarmingly, and reached their nadir late in 1455. In the short term the earl appears to have retained the confidence of the duke of York, who used him as an intermediary between himself and the king in a last-ditch effort to avert bloodshed on the eve of the first battle of St Albans, on 22 May 1455. He accompanied the captive king back to London after the battle as a member of York's entourage but, for reasons that remain unclear, Devon was unable or unwilling to exploit York's token of good will. York built up connections with a number of families, such as the extensive and powerful Neville clan, who were at the same time deepening or forging closer ties with Bonville. Feeling desperate and threatened, Devon and his sons resorted to extreme violence. The brutal murder by his retainers of Nicholas Radford, a greatly respected lawyer and councillor of Bonville, shocked even the hardened sensibilities of the age. A winter of widespread disorder led to a pitched battle between Devon and Bonville at Clyst Bridge, east of Exeter (15 December 1455). Indecisive though it was, the battle led to the earl's arrest and it was only Henry VI's intervention after his resumption of power that saved him from being tried for treason.<br>
<br>Exclusion from court patronage significantly undermined Devon's position at home. Far fewer Devon gentry had supported him at Clyst than in his earlier campaigns, and the situation was not redeemed despite strenuous efforts by the earl to capitalize on a new alliance&#151;this time with the king and Queen Margaret. Pardoned for his offences, he was restored to the bench of JPs and granted the keeping of the park and forest of Clarendon (February 1457). Devon was believed by some to have attempted to bring about a reconciliation between York and King Henry, but he died suddenly (but probably naturally) at Abingdon Abbey on 3 February 1458.<br>
<br>Thomas Courtenay, earl of Devon, has achieved notoriety as one of the more unruly of the &#145;overmighty subjects&#146; who destabilized political life in the middle years of the fifteenth century. The private wars in which he was engaged in the 1440s and 1450s briefly pushed him to the centre of the national stage, first as a supporter of Richard, duke of York, and second as the instigator of violence so severe as to predispose many lords towards the establishment of York's second protectorate (in November 1455). But violence was entered upon only as a last resort when peaceful channels seemed closed to him, and Devon's career illustrates as graphically as any during the period the effects on a landed aristocrat of long-term financial crisis and exclusion from power and influence at court.<br>
<br>The thirteenth earl's eldest son and successor, <a name="cosubject_64963"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Courtenay</span>, fourteenth earl of Devon  (1432&#150;1461)<span class="occ"></span>, remained an unflinching supporter of the queen, whose cousin Marie, daughter of Charles, count of Maine, he had married during 1456&#150;7, and he received a number of grants. The desperate consequences of uncontained conflict are graphically illustrated in Courtenay's brief career. Present at the battle of Wakefield (where both Bonville's son and grandson were killed), and the second battle of St Albans (following which Bonville himself was executed), he was injured at Towton and, unable &#145;to voyde a waye &hellip; was take and beheddyed&#146; at York on 3 April 1461  (<span class="italic">The Historical Collections of a Citizen of London</span>, 216).<br>
