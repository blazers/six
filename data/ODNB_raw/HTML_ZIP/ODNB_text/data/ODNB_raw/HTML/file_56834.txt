<span class="headword">Conyers,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1633&#150;1694), <span class="occ">apothecary and archaeologist</span>, was the eldest son of Edward Conyers (<i>b</i>. 1590) and his wife, Jane Clarke. The parents had married in London in January 1632 at the church of St Faith, the ruins of which lie under St Paul's Cathedral; however, by the time John Conyers was bound apprentice in August 1649 for eight years to Robert Phelps, citizen and apothecary of London, his parents were living at Little Bowden in Leicestershire. In February 1658 Conyers was examined and found proficient in his trade, and he gained his freedom of the London Society of Apothecaries. He never rose to great eminence in the society, but nevertheless paid his &pound;15 livery fine in December 1667. On 13 February 1666 at the church of St Clement Danes he married Mary Glisson, niece of the eminent physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10819/', "Francis Glisson")</script>. They had eight daughters and two sons, but only two daughters survived childhood.<br>
<br>Conyers was one of the many apothecaries who stayed in London during the plague period of 1665 to 1666. He had his own specific remedies for the infection and he advertised them in his booklet, <span class="italic">Direction for the Prevention and Cure of the Plague, Fitted for the Poorer Sort</span> [n.d.]. After the great fire of 1666 Conyers was to be found at the White Lyon, Fleet Street. There he was innovative enough to prepare an artificial mineral water, &#145;an essence made of the mineral which giveth the virtue to Tunbridge waters&#146;  (memoranda book). Conyers's pharmaceutical work was of great interest to him and was often used in his attempts to explain the phenomena of magnetism, electricity, fermentation, and fossilization. He experimented with the recently discovered phosphorus made by the chemist Godfrey Hanckwitz, and he was a frequent guest at the meetings of the Royal Society. He numbered among his friends such eminent people as Robert Hooke and Thomas Tompion, and he was on excellent terms with Jonathan Goddard, lecturer in physic at Gresham College. Goddard was a determined antagonist of apothecaries who practised medicine, which suggests that Conyers confined himself to running his pharmacy, making most of his own medicines and dispensing physicians' prescriptions.<br>
<br>Conyers participated eagerly in contemporary intellectual activities, offering solutions to mathematical problems, such as how to trisect an angle. He was keenly interested in meteorology and made observations with his thermoscopes, irrespective of the time of day. A practical man, he devised a number of inventions, details of which were published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Royal Society: a hygroscope, which the royal astronomer John Flamsteed borrowed in order to copy; an ear trumpet; and a pump, which Conyers claimed and Glisson and Goddard confirmed was used with great success on the new channel of the Fleet River.<br>
<br>However, Conyers is best remembered for his work in archaeology. The rebuilding of London after the great fire gave him the opportunity to gather &#145;antiquities&#146;, but he was a discerning and well-intentioned collector. His treasures were described in detail and compared with those in other collections, such as that of Elias Ashmole. Conyers understood the importance of the association of finds and he was the first person to suggest that the flint hand-axe was a weapon fashioned by humans. Even more importantly he realized the value of stratigraphy. He noted that small fragments of coloured stones were found at the east end of St Paul's Cathedral at a depth of 15 feet, and that there remained some Roman pottery even lower,<blockquote>which tells me this laying so low &amp; the Roman pott 6 or 8 or 10 foot deeper that as tyme passed awaye I might see the epochs or beginnings of things &amp; in these various heights of ground poynt &amp; show with my finger the Romans concernes lay deepest, then higher those of more recent or fresher concerne. (memoranda book, fol. 1096)</blockquote>The <span class="italic">Athenian Mercury</span> of 21 November 1691 relates that his &#145;curiosities&#146; could be viewed by the public, and it praised the range of materials to be seen.<br>
<br>By 1693 Conyers's health was failing and the Society of Apothecaries noted that he had &#145;left off trade&#146;. He died survived by his wife, and was buried on 8 April 1694 at St Bride's, Fleet Street. His will was not found but it is known from the 1695 edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> that Dr John Woodward was already in possession of most of his collection.<br>
