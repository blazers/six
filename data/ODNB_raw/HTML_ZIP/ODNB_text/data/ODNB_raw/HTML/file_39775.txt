<span class="headword">Baker,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was a lieutenant in the Irish army during the reign of Charles II. He was one of the protestant officers purged by the earl of Tyrconnell in 1686, after which he returned to his land at Dunmahon, co. Louth. After the English revolution of 1688 he left his family, swore allegiance to William III, and was promoted to the rank of major by the rebel &#145;consult&#146;. He was joint commander of the abortive raid on Carrickfergus (21 February 1689), when he led a thousand men on a night march from Belfast for a surprise attack at dawn. The weather was so bad that they did not reach their destination until the next day, and were kept out by musket fire from the walls.<br>
<br>Tyrconnell sent Richard Hamilton with an army to crush the rebellion in the north. The rebels attempted to block Hamilton's advance at Dromore, co. Down, which Baker occupied with four ill-armed companies of foot on the night of 13 March. The next day two troops of Irish horsemen were reported to be approaching Dromore, and Baker formed his men up to block the entrance to the town. The horsemen supporting him sallied out to find that they were facing Hamilton's army. In the rout that followed, &#145;the Break of Dromore&#146;, Baker's men fled to Hillsborough and beyond.<br>
<br>On 15 March Baker reached Coleraine, where he took part in the unsuccessful defence of the Bann (7 April), when Hamilton's men crossed in boats at Portglenone. With the remnants of the rebel anti-Jacobite forces, now leaderless, Baker fled to Londonderry. He arrived in mid-April to find the leadership of the city in crisis. Adam Murray had raised a mob against the governor, Robert Lundy, who was suspected of planning to surrender. On 19 April 1689 Baker was elected joint governor of Londonderry with George Walker, and commander of all the forces in the city, positions he held throughout the worst fighting of the siege. He was attainted of high treason by the Dublin parliament.<br>
<br>Baker's relationship with John Michelburne, who had also put himself forward as a candidate for the governorship, became strained. On 15 May he and Michelburne drew swords on each other following an argument over the allocation of the tobacco ration. In the fight that followed Baker wounded Michelburne in the leg and had him arrested and confined to his quarters.<br>
<br>Baker fell ill with a cold in early June and by 21 June was confined to bed. He appointed Michelburne as his deputy &#145;saying he was the fittest person to fill that station&#146;  (Ash, 79). He returned to duty and stayed up directing his men throughout the night of 28 June when fresh troops led by Lord Clancarty attacked the butcher's gate. Weakened through fever and exhaustion, he died on 30 June 1689.<blockquote>He was a great loss to the garrison, greatly beloved and very well qualified for the government, being endured with great patience and moderation; free from envy or malice as may be seen in the affair betwixt him and Mitchelburn. (Ash, 82)</blockquote>Michelburne, Walker, and four others acted as his pallbearers. He was buried in St Columb's Cathedral in the city. Ann Baker, his widow, survived him with their four children, who were compensated by the crown with a forfeited estate.<br>
