<span class="headword">Wilson,  Guy Livingstone</span>  (1885&#150;1962), <span class="occ">gardener</span>, was born at Knockboy, Skerry, co. Antrim, on 29 January 1885, the son of William Orr Wilson (1834&#150;1906), owner of a small farm, Knowehead, at Coreen, near Broughshane, and also of a drapery business in Ballymena, and his wife, Jemima, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnett (1843&#150;1910). His family was of Scottish covenanting descent, and he had a strong Presbyterian upbringing, one of his brothers becoming a Presbyterian minister. His mother introduced him to daffodils at an early age through plantings of yellow daffodils she made around the farmhouse. One of his clearest childhood memories was an occasion when he asked his mother whether there were any white daffodils, and was surprised by her affirmative reply, although she added that she had not seen any herself. She gave him a copy of <span class="italic">Ye Original Little Booke of Daffodils</span> for 1888, a catalogue compiled by the Cork nurseryman and daffodil breeder William Baylor Hartland (1836&#150;1912), and it was this book that set Wilson's future course as a hybridist. He later recalled hours spent poring over Hartland's catalogue, and the inspiration it provided. He was a boarder at Campbell College, Belfast, and Belfast Academy. While still a pupil at Campbell College he had begun hybridizing daffodils, his registration of three cultivars in 1907 indicating that these crosses had been made in his early teens.<br>
<br>Wilson's intention on leaving school was to become a daffodil grower, but his mother insisted that he join his cousin's cloth manufacturing firm, which owned the Raceview and Knowehead woollen mills at Broughshane. He became the firm's chief dyer, his eye for colour serving him well in his later work with daffodils. His mill duties seldom interfered with his main interest, and in 1920 he gave up the job, saying that he was ashamed to continue to draw money from the firm. Instead, orders for his bulbs enabled him to set up in business as a full-time daffodil hybridist. On land bought at The Knockan, Broughshane, in 1916, he built a house in 1923, which enjoyed a fine view to the Slemish Mountain. He remained unmarried and lived and worked there for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Wilson's work in breeding new and progressively improving white daffodils brought him recognition as &#145;one of the world's leading raisers of new daffodils&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Feb 1962). His greatest work was with white trumpet cultivars, beginning in 1922 with &#145;White Dame&#146;. In 1934 he achieved his major breakthrough with the registration of &#145;Kanchenjunga&#146;, a tetraploid showing great vigour, flower quality, and size; it was the major influence on the future breeding of white trumpet daffodils, and featured in most of Wilson's subsequent successes, which included &#145;Empress of Ireland&#146; (1952). He also had major success with large and small cupped whites. Although his major interest was in improving whites, other types of daffodils were not neglected, and he bred the <i>poeticus</i> hybrid &#145;Cantabile&#146; (1932), the yellow and orange &#145;Armada&#146; (1938), the pioneering reverse bicolour &#145;Spellbinder&#146; (1944), and the pink and white &#145;Passionale&#146; (1956). Many of his introductions of all types remained as top exhibition cultivars until the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Wilson was a familiar figure at daffodil shows in his characteristic knickerbocker outfit, cloth cap, and knitted stockings. In his early twenties, at the Midland Daffodil Society's show at Birmingham, he met many of the best-known daffodil growers, notably the celebrated amateur hybridist George Herbert Engleheart (1851/2&#150;1936). He maintained a twenty-year friendship with another noted breeder, Ian Brodie (1868&#150;1943) of Brodie Castle, Elgin, and among the last visitors to his collection before his death was another great Irish daffodil hybridist, J. Lionel Richardson (1890&#150;1961) of Waterford. He was also a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Daffodil Year Book</span> and other gardening periodicals.<br>
<br>Wilson received many awards, including the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria medal of honour (1950) and the honorary degree of master of agriculture from Queen's University, Belfast (1951). He was guest of honour at the first convention of the American Daffodil Society in 1956, when it was acknowledged that &#145;the genetic strains resulting from wise and painstaking hybridisation by an outstanding plant breeder will necessarily be part of plants and gardens for centuries to come&#146;  (Lee, 5).<br>
<br>Wilson was increasingly frail towards the end of his life and in 1961 his bulb stocks were acquired by P. De Jager &amp; Sons of Marden, Kent. He died of a stroke at the Braid Valley Hospital, Ballymena, co. Antrim, on 5 February 1962. From 1971 a large collection of Wilson cultivars was planted at the University of Ulster, Coleraine, where the Guy L. Wilson Daffodil Garden was named in his memory. Opening the garden in April 1974, his nephew Professor Fergus Wilson described the character traits that had led to Guy Wilson's success: total dedication, infinite patience, and the capacity to learn from experience, which largely made good his lack of formal scientific education. The garden was designated a heritage garden in 1981 and a national collection in 1982.<br>
