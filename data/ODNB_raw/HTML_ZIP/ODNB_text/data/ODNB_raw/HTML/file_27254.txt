<span class="headword">Thomlinson,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1668, <em>d.</em> 1748), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was baptized on 10 August 1668 at Wigton, Cumberland, the youngest son of Richard Thomlinson of Akehead, near Wigton, of an old Durham family. He was educated at Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 22 March 1686, and graduated BA from St Edmund Hall in 1689, proceeding MA in 1692. He was later incorporated at Cambridge, in 1719, and graduated DD from King's College in that year. In 1692 he held for a time the post of vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, and in 1695 he was appointed lecturer of St Nicholas's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. On 8 April 1702 he married Martha Ray, at East Ardsley, near Leeds, Yorkshire; they do not appear to have had any children. In 1712, after holding minor posts, which he probably owed to a family connection with Dr John Robinson, he became rector of Whickham, co. Durham, on the recommendation of Lord Crewe, bishop of Durham. In 1715 he was appointed master of St Mary's Hospital, Newcastle, and four years later Robinson appointed him to a vacant prebend at St Paul's Cathedral, London.<br>
<br>Between 1720 and 1725, as executor of his brother John, rector of Rothbury, Northumberland, Thomlinson erected at Wigton a hospital (the College of Matrons) for the widows of poor clergymen; he himself contributed part of the expense and provided a schoolmaster's house for the parish. In 1734 he gave liberally to the rebuilding of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, under Thomas Shaw, and shortly afterwards donated some 1600 books to form the nucleus of a public library for Newcastle. A building was provided to accommodate the books, and the library was opened to the public in October 1741. The librarian's salary was funded by an endowment from Sir Walter Blackett, and Thomlinson endowed the library with an annual income of &pound;5 to be spent on the purchase of books. He was also responsible for the rules of the library, which were enforced by the first librarian, Nathaniel Clayton. After Thomlinson's death the library was neglected&#151;a catalogue of 1829 revealed high levels of theft and disrepair&#151;but the collection was later salvaged and housed at the city's central library.<br>
<br>Thomlinson's other benefactions included a chapel of ease at Allenby in Cumberland, the charity school at Whickham, and considerable bequests to Queen's College, Oxford, to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (of which he was one of the earliest members), and to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He died at Whickham on 24 March 1748 and was buried in the north aisle of Whickham church. He was survived by his wife.<br>
