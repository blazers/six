<span class="headword">Cunnington <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pegge]</span>,  Maud Edith</span>  (1869&#150;1951), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 24 September 1869 at Vernon House, Briton Ferry, Glamorgan, one of the seven children of Charles Pegge, formerly Pigg (<i>b</i>. 1834), surgeon, and his wife, Catherine Milton Leach (<i>b</i>. 1837), fifth of the fourteen daughters of Robert Valentine Leach of Devizes, Wiltshire. When Robert Leach's business as a corn merchant failed, he established a private asylum at Briton Ferry where his future son-in-law was a doctor. By the time Catherine married, her father had been able to return to Devizes, where he bought and restored Devizes Castle. Maud was educated briefly at Cheltenham Ladies' College. On 9 July 1889 she married (Edward) Benjamin Howard Cunnington (1861&#150;1950), the son of Henry Cunnington, a wine merchant. Benjamin, who had been a journalist before joining his father's business, was the fourth generation of his family to record and preserve the antiquities of Wiltshire and was for sixty years the honorary curator of Devizes Museum. Maud's involvement with archaeology is said to have developed through the interest of their only child, Edward, whose death in the First World War was a grief from which she never recovered.<br>
<br>In 1897 the Cunningtons settled at 33 Long Street, Devizes, where Maud spent each winter writing articles and excavation reports and sorting and mending pottery, at which she was expert. To the chagrin of later archaeologists she left no original notes, but her detailed articles in the <span class="italic">Wiltshire Archaeological Magazine</span>, 1909&#150;42, provide a good overview of her work. In the early days she recorded the destruction of barrows for such purposes as a golf course near Warminster, providing stone for a cowshed floor, and levelling the &#145;flying course of the new Aviation School on the downs above Upavon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wiltshire Archaeological Magazine</span>, 37, 1912, 603).<br>
<br>Maud Cunnington's most important contribution was not in rescue work but in original excavations. Most notable of these were the first known Neolithic causewayed camp at Knap Hill, Alton Priors, 1908&#150;9; a village site of the Hallstatt period at All Cannings Cross, 1911 and 1920&#150;22; West Kennet Long Barrow, 1925; Woodhenge, which was named by the Cunningtons, 1926&#150;8; and the Sanctuary on Overton Hill, 1930. She rediscovered the Sanctuary, lost since the eighteenth century, by standing at Stukeley's viewpoint and counting the telegraph poles to a distant glimpse of the site. Woodhenge was first identified from the air since nothing of the former timber structure was visible on the ground. Both Woodhenge and the Sanctuary are the subject of books by her (1923 and 1929). The sites were purchased by the Cunningtons and presented to the nation.<br>
<br>The Second World War brought excavations to a close, but Maud Cunnington and her husband continued their long-standing involvement with Devizes Museum and with the Wiltshire Archaeological Society, of which she had been elected president in 1931. Their finds were deposited in the museum, and Maud was co-author of the museum catalogue (1934). She is known to have had disagreements with other notable archaeologists; but she was respected for her dedication and integrity and she earned the gratitude of many.<br>
<br>In recognition of her pioneering work Maud Cunnington was made an honorary life member of the Cambrian Archaeological Association and of the Society of Antiquaries, Scotland. In 1948 she was made CBE for services to archaeology, the first woman to be so honoured; but she probably never knew this. Bedridden since 1947, she suffered from Alzheimer's disease. She and her husband, who predeceased her by three months, were nursed at home by a family friend. She died at her home, 33 Long Street, Devizes, on 28 February 1951, and was cremated on 3 March at Arnos Vale, Bristol. She left almost all her property (&pound;14,000) to Devizes Museum, so enabling a professional curator to be appointed according to her wishes.<br>
