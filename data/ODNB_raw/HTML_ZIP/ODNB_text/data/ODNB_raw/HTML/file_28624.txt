He had five sisters, including Mary (1527/8&#150;1577), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18696/', "Sir Walter Mildmay (1520/21&#150;1589)")</script> on 25 May 1546, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1596), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29051/', "Peter Wentworth (1524&#150;1597)")</script>, and Christiana, who married John Tamworth (<i>c</i>.1524&#150;1569), keeper of the privy purse from 1559 to 1569, in 1562. His uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28622/', "Sir Edmund Walsingham (b. in or before 1480, d. 1550)")</script>, lieutenant of the Tower of London from 1521 until his death. Like so many of Elizabeth I's servants he came from a family with existing court connections.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareerc15321568"></a>Education and early career, c.1532&#150;1568</h2>William Walsingham was a member of Gray's Inn and autumn reader in 1530. He was also involved in local administration in Kent and purchased Foots Cray in 1529. His last will was written on 1 March and proved on 23 March 1534 and left Foots Cray to his son, Francis Walsingham. About 1536 his widow married Sir John Carey of Plashy in Hertfordshire, the younger brother of William Carey, who married Mary Boleyn (<i>c</i>.1499&#150;1543) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70719/', "Stafford, Mary")</script>], and with whom she had two sons. Francis Walsingham probably first went up to King's College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner in spring 1548. He was certainly there by 2 June and matriculated as a pensioner of the college on 29 September. Thanks to its provost, Sir John Cheke, the ethos of the college was strongly reformist after 1547, with emphasis on study of scripture to justify one's argument, and on learning rhetoric and dialectic through the works of Aristotle, Plato, and Cicero. As befitted his status Walsingham left on 29 September 1550 without taking a degree. According to the inscription on his tomb, after leaving Cambridge he apparently travelled on the continent, though where and in what capacity is unknown, but he had returned by 1552, when his stepfather died, and he was admitted to Gray's Inn.<br>
<br>Walsingham returned to the continent in the reign of Mary I, but under circumstances that pose a number of questions. He is first encountered in Basel in autumn 1555 escorting his cousins, the three sons of his mother's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7506/', "Sir Anthony Denny (1501&#150;1549)")</script>, of Cheshunt. However, by the end of the year he had moved to Padua, where he enrolled as a student in civil law at the university and on 29 December 1555 was appointed <i>consilarius</i> or spokesman for the English students there, a position he retained until 8 April 1556. Thereafter his movements are unknown. The Dennys had in fact been in Padua in autumn 1554, together with Walsingham's future brother-in-law Tamworth, and there is no reason why he could not have been with them then.<br>
<br>In December 1555 Padua was the centre of much activity. Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, had been living in Venice since June, and Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, arrived in Padua in January 1556 <i>en route</i> for Venice. The assembly of Englishmen there has been associated with the conspiracy known as the Dudley plot, which was halted first by the French, who signed the truce of Vaucelles with Charles V on 5 February, and then by the exposure of the plot in England in March. Devon died in Padua on 18 September. During 1556 many of the Englishmen there dispersed and it is possible that Walsingham returned to Basel. In moments of stress in later life he recalled his time in Switzerland almost with longing. On 28 March 1586 he complained to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, &#145;the opynion of my partyalytie contynewethe [continueth] noryshed by factyon, which makethe me weerye of the place I serve in, and to wysshe myself emongst the trewe harted Swy[ss]&#146;, and he expressed similar sentiments on 22 June 1588: &#145;I would &hellip; we were &hellip; in Basil [Basel] to pray for Princes&#146; (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leycester</span>, ed. J. Bruce, CS, old ser., 27, 1844, 192; <span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 3.332).<br>
<br>Although it is not known precisely why he went into exile, or how far he was involved in the conspiracies of 1555&#150;6, several of Walsingham's later associates were companions abroad. Three works of John Foxe, Basel's most famous English resident, were later dedicated to him. More immediately significant may have been the connection to Bedford, for Walsingham is next detected as an MP for Bossiney, Cornwall, in the parliament that assembled on 23 January 1559 to enact the settlement of religion. Bedford (who was lord warden of the stannaries) is the obvious patron, though it is also clear that his west-country seats were used as a form of reserve for men the privy council wished to see returned as MPs. In 1563 Walsingham was returned for Lyme Regis, Dorset; there is a reference by Sir William Cecil, the principal secretary, to wishing to see him in the parliament. However, Walsingham made little impression on the House of Commons in the 1560s, and even when he was principal secretary his parliamentary performances as knight of the shire for Surrey (1572, 1584, 1586, and 1589) were perfunctory. P. W. Hasler has observed that &#145;it is clear that the House of Commons held little appeal for him&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 3.573).<br>
<br>No less mysterious is the apparent absence of any public employment before 1568, given Walsingham's sudden rise to international prominence after 1570, or of much information about him at all during the 1560s. One reason is the disappearance of his personal papers. As secretary, Walsingham organized his official papers very carefully. A pocket index compiled by his secretary Thomas Lake about 1588 survives, now entitled &#145;Walsingham's table book&#146; (BL, Stowe MS 162). As well as the standard bundles of correspondence, Walsingham's papers contained &#145;books of matters&#146; (effectively reference books), and &#145;Diaria&#146; or repertories, either indices to bundles of correspondence or letter-books. Their fate after his death was complicated. According to his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1804/', "Robert Beale (1541&#150;1601)")</script>, writing about 1592, &#145;all his papers and bookes both publicke and private were seazed on and carried away&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 1.431). Other evidence shows them kept as a collection, though whether they remained as such or were taken into the Cecil papers later in the 1590s is less clear. Only a few of the books survive, but the correspondence now forms a large part of the Elizabethan state papers. In the process all private material was weeded out and has disappeared with the exception of two semi-official diaries or &#145;leigerbooks&#146;, one covering the years 1570 to 1583 (Martin, ed., &#145;Journal of Sir Francis Walsingham&#146;), and the other 1583 to 1584 (BL, Harley MS 6035). Like that of his prot&eacute;g&eacute; William Davison&#151;but unlike Leicester's&#151;Walsingham's official career can be reconstructed in detail, but his private life remains largely a blank.<br>
<br>Walsingham's mother died in 1560 and was buried beside his father in St Mary Aldermanbury, London. In 1562 Walsingham married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1564), daughter of Sir George Barne of London, and his wife, Alice, and widow of Alexander Carleill. They had no children. She was a wealthy woman when she died in summer or autumn 1564 (her will dated 28 July and proved 22 November), leaving her children in Walsingham's care. These included the future soldier and naval commander <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4668/', "Christopher Carleill (1551?&#150;1593)")</script>, for whom he had a particular affection and whose career he promoted assiduously. It was probably to his marriage that he owed his association with the Muscovy Company. Sir George Barne was one of the founders of the company and Alexander Carleill had been one of the original stockholders. Walsingham was involved heavily in the company's activities by summer 1568 and became an assistant the following year.<br>
<br>In autumn 1566 he married Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1602), daughter of Henry St Barbe of Somerset and widow of Sir Richard Worseley of the Isle of Wight. His courtship was probably the reason for his earliest surviving letter, a ponderously jocular request to Sir William More of Loseley, Surrey, on 23 October 1565 for his help in persuading &#145;the gentlewoman from her resolution of sole lyfe&#146;  (Surrey RO, Guildford, Loseley corresp., 3/56). The couple had two daughters, Frances (<i>c</i>.1568&#150;1632), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25522/', "Sir Philip Sidney (1554&#150;1586)")</script> on 21 September 1583, and Mary, who died as a child in 1580. After 1566 Walsingham established his household at his new wife's house, Appuldurcombe, on the Isle of Wight, and then nearby at her late husband's house, Carisbrooke Castle. On 6 September 1567 an accidental explosion of gunpowder at the gatehouse at Appuldurcombe killed his two stepsons from his second marriage. Consequently legal action began over Ursula Walsingham's rights in the Worseley estate at Carisbrooke Priory which continued until July 1571. Ursula Walsingham features little in the surviving record but she was regarded with genuine affection by her husband's friends, including Leicester, whose distant cousin she was.<h2>
<a name="RoyalserviceandembassytoFrance15681573"></a>Royal service and embassy to France, 1568&#150;1573</h2>Walsingham's residence in the Isle of Wight in the late 1560s may explain his escape from public employment. On the other hand, by 1568 he was an established prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, an association that probably began through their connection with Bedford during the Marian exile. Walsingham may have served in an unrecorded capacity with Throckmorton on one of his Scottish embassies in the late 1560s. His earliest surviving letter to Cecil was written on Throckmorton's behalf in August 1568 and dealt with a subject of major importance. This was the mission of Robert Stewart, who brought from Louis de Bourbon-Vend&ocirc;me, prince de Cond&eacute;, and Gaspard de Coligny, admiral of France, the first proposal that Elizabeth should marry Henri, duc d'Anjou.<br>
<br>On 20 December 1568 Walsingham wrote to Cecil that &#145;there is lesse daynger in fearinge to myche then to lyttle&#146;, and &#145;ther is nothinge more dayngerowse then [than] securyte&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/48/61, fol. 165<i>r</i>). In this case by &#145;securyte&#146; he meant carelessness or a culpable absence of anxiety. These statements became his credo. In autumn 1569 Cecil used Walsingham as the guardian of Roberto di Ridolfi. However, Walsingham's handling of Ridolfi was not assured and his reports to Cecil about him appear na&iuml;ve in retrospect. Conyers Read thought that Walsingham might have been the anonymous author of a tract produced at this time attacking the prospective marriage between Mary, queen of Scots, and Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk (BL, Harley MS 290), but the attribution has since been challenged.<br>
<br>In February 1570 Walsingham and Henry Killigrew were nominated as successors to Sir Henry Norris as resident ambassador in Paris. The embassy to the French court was the only permanent English residency (it had been agreed by treaty in 1518), but it was notoriously considered very expensive. Norris (for example) was married to the heir of a baron. Although Killigrew was the more experienced, Cecil appears to have considered him &#145;in livelihood much inferior&#146; to Walsingham, and by summer 1570 Walsingham was the main candidate  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 1.94). If he lacked diplomatic experience, he possessed the requisite linguistic skills. He was fluent in both French and Italian, though not (on his own admission) Spanish.<br>
<br>Walsingham was initially appointed special ambassador to France on 11 August 1570 (with a diet of &pound;2 per day), to assist Norris in persuading Charles IX to bring the third War of Religion to an end&#151;but even before he left England the peace of St Germain was signed (8 August). He had an audience with Charles on or about 29 August, which consisted largely of congratulations on the settlement. Shortly afterwards he was informed that he would be Norris's successor, but he was allowed to return to England to organize his private affairs first, and left Paris on 29 September. His letters of instruction for the resident embassy were dated 19 December. He had protested that he could not afford the embassy, and as a result his diets were increased to &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per day, slightly more than Norris had received. Walsingham took with him as secretary his brother-in-law Beale (married to his wife's sister Edith), who served with him until his own appointment as clerk of the privy council in July 1572. Walsingham presented his credentials at a formal audience with Charles on 25 January 1571.<br>
<br>Cecil and Leicester had backed Walsingham's appointment, and he was clearly on very close terms with both. Leicester addressed him throughout his embassy as &#145;my good Francis&#146;. Paris was the cockpit of Europe during the two and a half years of Walsingham's residence (which lasted until 10 May 1573), and as a result he became an international figure, forming a range of friendships and contacts that he sustained throughout his future career. His correspondence files for the embassy were later obtained by Sir Robert Cotton (probably purloined from the state paper office), and numerous copies of them were made. One was published in 1655 as <span class="italic">The compleat ambassador</span>, the first printed collection of diplomatic papers in English.<br>
<br>Initially Walsingham had a much easier task than his predecessors. After the peace of St Germain the Huguenots were prominent at court, the Guise had withdrawn, and Catherine de' Medici was eager for good relations with Elizabeth. This marked a major turning point in Elizabethan foreign policy, for since the beginning of the reign relations with France had been tense at best. However, the trade war with Spain that began in 1569 and suspected Spanish intrigues in Ireland suggested that Philip II now posed the greater danger. This was confirmed during the first year of Walsingham's embassy by the exposure of the Ridolfi plot (summer 1571), which revealed that Philip was prepared to support the deposition of Elizabeth in favour of Mary.<br>
<br>Walsingham's contribution to the formulation of policy was to argue along these lines, and certain themes that became central to his future approach to foreign affairs can be detected in his correspondence from France. Like many protestants he remained convinced that a Catholic league had been made at Bayonne, where Charles IX and Catherine met Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, duke of Alva, between 15 June and 2 July 1565, but he was now convinced that Spain represented the greater threat. If not entirely persuaded by the expressions of goodwill from the French royal family he considered that so long as the Huguenots remained powerful France could not harm England. The most immediate danger to Elizabeth was the queen of Scots, and he never ceased to regret publicly that she was not executed in 1572. On the other hand he felt that Elizabeth could be assured of Scotland if she subsidized the protestant and Anglophile king's party.<br>
<br>Two major issues came to dominate Walsingham's embassy: the proposed marriage to Anjou and the Netherlands enterprise. The Huguenots, who had first proposed the Anjou marriage in 1568, revived it in autumn 1570 as a means of making a close alliance between England and France which would sustain their newly won security. The suggestion was well received by Catherine, though for her own motives: Anjou was her favourite son, and she was convinced by a prophecy that all her sons would wear crowns. At the same time alliances with both England and the Holy Roman empire (Charles IX married Maximilian II's daughter Elizabeth in 1570) would neutralize the Huguenots' main foreign allies. Elizabeth was less enthusiastic, particularly over the age difference (she was thirty-seven and Anjou nineteen). Moreover, as had been the case with Archduke Karl between 1565 and 1567, she expected to be wooed, and thus the negotiations tended to be conducted either through the French ambassador in London, Bertrand de Salignac de la Motte-F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, or by special envoys. Walsingham's contribution to the negotiations was to keep her informed of the attitude of Catherine and Charles.<br>
<br>Early in 1571 a draft set of the French terms was sent to England. The English response was that overall Anjou would be offered the terms granted to Philip when he had married Mary I in 1554, but Elizabeth would not (as she had previously refused the Archduke Karl) grant him public exercise of Catholicism. For his part Anjou had no desire for the marriage. At the beginning of 1571 he had openly described Elizabeth as a woman of immoral character (which his mother anxiously denied), and by the summer he made it clear he would accept nothing less than public exercise of his religion.<br>
<br>By then Walsingham had become involved heavily in the Netherlands enterprise. This was the plan devised by the supporters of William of Orange and the Huguenots for an alliance of England, France, and the German protestant princes to support a revolt in the Netherlands against Philip's governor-general, Alva. Once the Spaniards had been driven out the Netherlands would be partitioned, France obtaining Artois and Flanders, and Elizabeth Holland and Zeeland, while the remaining provinces under the immediate government of Orange would rejoin the Holy Roman empire. On 19 July 1571 Louis of Nassau, Orange's brother, presented the plan to Charles IX at an interview arranged by Coligny. On 6 August Louis had a similar meeting with Walsingham.<br>
<br>The Netherlands enterprise set the tone for Walsingham's future approach to foreign affairs. It was a bold stroke, and risks would have to be run, but the advantages success offered outweighed the risks. Together with his detailed reports on his conversations with Louis of Nassau and others he drafted a short memorandum on the subject: &#145;Whether it may stand in good policy for her majesty to join with France in the enterprise of Burgundy&#146;. A number of manuscript copies (including BL, Harley MS 168, fols. 154<i>r</i>&#150;157<i>v</i>) of the memorandum survive, but Read curiously overlooked it. Some of the copies attribute the memorandum to Cecil (Baron Burghley from 1571), but similarities in phraseology between the memorandum and Walsingham's reports to London in August 1571 establishes him as the author. Walsingham used the memorandum to answer the main objections to the plan: that it would engage Elizabeth in a major war, that it would break the old alliance with Burgundy, and that the French motive for participating was simply to annex the Netherlands. He justified the enterprise on the grounds that recent events had revealed Spain to be Elizabeth's main enemy, that under Philip's rule the Netherlands were no longer an ally, and that partition would prevent French expansion. Moreover, Charles's reception of Louis of Nassau suggested that the French crown was sincerely committed to the enterprise.<br>
<br>Thanks to the enterprise it was vital that even if the marriage failed a formal alliance should still be made with France. Leicester may have suggested the alliance as an alternative to the marriage at the beginning of July, but Walsingham gave it his support early in August, and Charles at roughly the same time. Elizabeth and Burghley were more sceptical, but in early September they came round and the queen agreed to send a special envoy to join Walsingham in negotiating the treaty. At this point Walsingham was forced to take to his bed for nearly four months (3 November 1571 to 28 February 1572). The cause was a urinary complaint&#151;a &#145;certaine difficult&eacute; de uryne qui le travaille fort&#146;, as la Motte-F&eacute;n&eacute;lon described it&#151;that dogged him for the rest of his life  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Teulet, 4.247). Killigrew was sent to Paris to substitute for him, followed by Sir Thomas Smith, who was to join him in making the treaty.<br>
<br>As soon as he had recovered Walsingham and Smith negotiated what became the treaty of Blois, signed on 19 April 1572. On instructions from London the Anglo-French alliance was kept strictly defensive and the Netherlands enterprise was not mentioned, although it was implied in the agreement to shift the English cloth staple from the Netherlands (actually based in Hamburg since the embargo of 1569) to France. The most debated items were the English demand that the defensive arrangements should override religious considerations (<i>etiamsi causa religionis</i>), so that France was committed to aid England in the event of an attack by Spain, and the French demand for the inclusion of the queen of Scots. In the event a compromise was struck and neither was included. Walsingham was prepared to accept an assurance of assistance in a private letter from Charles, while the French effectively conceded to the ascendancy of the king's party over the Marians in Scotland.<br>
<br>The negotiation of the treaty of Blois was accompanied by Catherine's revival of the marriage proposal, now on the part of her youngest son, Fran&ccedil;ois, duc d'Alen&ccedil;on. Against the obvious objections to the even wider difference in age (Elizabeth was almost thirty-nine, Alen&ccedil;on only seventeen) and his facial deformities, Catherine offered the assurance that he would be more flexible in religion than his brother. Elizabeth was even less happy with the Alen&ccedil;on proposal, but it initiated a major revolution in her &#145;courtships&#146;. Alen&ccedil;on displayed an enthusiasm for the marriage and sent his current favourite, Joseph de Boniface, seigneur de La Molle, to England to begin the wooing in summer 1572. However, the cautious Anglo-French negotiations had already been overtaken by the revolt in the Netherlands that followed the landing of the Sea Beggars at Den Briel on 1 April. While various Huguenot forces attempted to come to the rebels' assistance, neither Charles nor Elizabeth (for their various reasons) were prepared to fulfil the role planned for them in the enterprise. Walsingham was left in the position of exhorting London not to let the opportunity slip. He wrote to Leicester on 28 May:<blockquote>I hope it shall manifestly appear unto you, that upon the good success or evil success of this [enterprise depends the] common cause of religion. And besides, the same not well proceeding, her Majestie cannot promise to herself any great safety, having so dangerous a neighbour, whose greatness shall receive no small increase, if he overcome this brunt. I pray God therefore that her Majestie may incline to do that which may be for her safety. (<span class="italic">Compleat Ambassador</span>, ed. Digges, 216)</blockquote>The Netherlands enterprise was one of the many casualties of the massacre of St Bartholomew's eve (23&#150;4 August). Walsingham has left no account of his experiences, and the extent of his personal danger is unclear. His residence was in the Faubourg St Germain on the left bank, at a distance from the main riots, and he was able to provide a refuge for Sidney and other Englishmen in Paris, and possibly some Huguenots as well. He carried himself with considerable dignity and restraint in his first audience with Catherine after the massacre (14 September), but the experience scarred him and shaped his future attitude to France.<br>
<br>At the audience Catherine emphasized that the massacre was purely an internal affair, that the treaty of Blois remained in force, and that she was still keen for the marriage of Elizabeth and Alen&ccedil;on, even proposing that she and Elizabeth meet. Both Walsingham and Elizabeth regarded these professions of goodwill with scepticism, and Elizabeth was ready to recall him immediately. However, in view of the confused situation it was decided that he should remain for the meantime as a gesture of her goodwill, while a successor was chosen. But as Walsingham admitted candidly to the privy council a month afterwards, he had been wrong about the French royal family and his whole Netherlands strategy was in ruins: &#145;I may seem to have dealt over-confidently; but I know your honours do consider that my error in that behalf was common with a great many wiser than myself, and therefore I hope you do hold me excused&#146;  (<span class="italic">Compleat Ambassador</span>, ed. Digges, 257). Like his colleagues in London he considered that the assurance of Scotland through an effective alliance with the king's party was now the most immediate concern and entered into a direct correspondence with the Scottish regents to that effect. The remainder of his embassy in France was something of an anticlimax. Apart from reporting the course of the fourth War of Religion, which broke out after the massacre, his main activity was to help London evaluate the bona fides of Jer&ocirc;me de l'Huillier, seigneur de Maisonfleur, whom Alen&ccedil;on sent to Elizabeth in November to persuade her that he had opposed the massacre and wished to seek refuge in England. At last in May 1573 Dr Valentine Dale was dispatched to relieve him and Walsingham was able to return.<h2>
<a name="Principalsecretaryandprivycouncillor15731578"></a>Principal secretary and privy councillor, 1573&#150;1578</h2>On 20 December 1573 Walsingham was appointed a principal secretary, and on the following day a privy councillor. This was the final stage of the first major reshaping of Elizabeth's privy council since the beginning of the reign. After the appointments of Leicester and Norfolk in 1562 the privy council had remained effectively static, except for the deaths of older members (six, all peers, died between 1570 and 1573) and their replacement. There was an established inner ring of Cecil, Leicester, and Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom Elizabeth showed no desire to change. What initiated the reshaping was Cecil's creation as Baron Burghley on 25 February 1571. At the time Leicester informed Walsingham that Burghley would be appointed lord privy seal as well. This did not happen, and instead in March, Smith, who had been principal secretary from 1548 to 1549 as well as ambassador to France from 1563 to 1565, was sworn of the privy council, perhaps to assist Burghley in the secretaryship. A possible alternative, Throckmorton, was eliminated by his death on 12 February 1571. The death of the lord treasurer, William Paulet, first marquess of Winchester, on 10 March 1572 triggered a more complicated reshuffle. On 13 July (after his return from France) Smith was appointed principal secretary and William Howard, first Baron Howard of Effingham, surrendered the lord chamberlaincy to Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex (who had been sworn of the privy council in December 1570). On 15 July Burghley was appointed lord treasurer, and Howard, lord privy seal, but he died only six months later on 12 January 1573.<br>
<br>This reshuffle brought little new blood into the privy council. Apart from Sussex, Smith, and George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury (also in 1571), the only other new privy councillor since 1569 was Leicester's brother Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick (5 September 1573). Walsingham may have expected appointment as principal secretary on his return, for Leicester had informed him on 8 January 1573, &#145;you know what opinion is here of you, and to what place all men would have you unto &hellip; besides that, the place you alreadie hold is a Counsellours place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Compleat Ambassador</span>, ed. Digges, 322). However, Elizabeth may have baulked initially at the appointment of a second principal secretary&#151;a novelty for her reign. Retrospectively, Walsingham's appointment was seen as the consequence of his diplomatic achievements, creating a widespread belief that the secretaryship would be the culmination of a successful diplomatic career, but in practice this rarely occurred.<br>
<br>A few surviving privy council memoranda in his hand from early January 1574 reveal Walsingham already at work, but tracing a specific influence thereafter is less easy. Read noted that &#145;the actual information which we possess about his life&#146; during Walsingham's first four years as secretary, from 1574 to 1578, is &#145;lamentably little&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 1.372). The secretaryship was perhaps the most onerous of the major offices, involving almost constant attendance on the queen as well as the privy council. As the handler of routine correspondence the secretary was the primary point of contact for a range of diplomats and officials, as well as the multitude of suitors to the crown. In the absence of a lord privy seal the secretary also had charge of that seal. However, the loss of privy seal records in the Whitehall Palace fire of 1619 has made it almost impossible to assess that side of his duties. Walsingham's urinary complaint (which may have been a kidney stone) forced him to take frequent sick leave. He was absent from the court for nearly four months between 24 December 1574 and 17 April 1575 (though writing letters furiously from his bed), and further absences were noted at the beginning of 1576, 1577, and 1578. In the autumn of 1576 he informed Burghley that he was exhausted and wished to resign.<br>
<br>The reshuffle had made little difference to the size of the privy council, which numbered sixteen in 1574 as against fifteen in 1568. Moreover, the principal figures, Leicester, Burghley, Bacon, and, after 1571, Sussex, retained their dominant influence with Elizabeth. Walsingham only slowly obtained a position similar to theirs. Smith was the senior secretary in 1574, but he was elderly, his health was deteriorating, and he retired sick in April 1576, dying on 12 August 1577. Sir Thomas Wilson quickly replaced him on 12 November 1577, the day on which Sir Christopher Hatton was appointed vice-chamberlain and sworn of the privy council. Walsingham's observations on the pressure of business at the time of Wilson's appointment make it clear that an assistant was considered necessary. Although Wilson was considerably older than Walsingham and had recent diplomatic experience in the Netherlands, Walsingham was now clearly the senior secretary, as was reflected in his knighting on 1 December 1577.<br>
<br>Walsingham's entry into high politics was very much as subordinate to Burghley and Leicester. He acted as their agent in executing the abortive plan to free Alen&ccedil;on on the eve of Charles's death on 30 May 1574 and then in sending a subsidy to Friedrich III, the elector palatine, to aid Alen&ccedil;on and the Huguenots during the fifth War of Religion in autumn 1575. The triumvirate of Burghley, Leicester, and Sussex dominated Irish affairs, and it was only in 1575 that Walsingham began to join them. Walsingham's own hand is clearest in French policy, not least because his agents (like the Italian Jacomo Manucci) continued to serve his successors. He also took a particular interest in Scotland, cultivating close contacts with the regent, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, whom he openly admired, and who in turn relied on him for news and information.<br>
<br>The Netherlands proved the most difficult area. There is some evidence that Burghley (with Elizabeth's backing) had hoped to use the treaty of Blois and her refusal to execute Mary as a means of persuading Spain into a peaceful settlement of the trade war. In the months after St Bartholomew's eve Burghley moved swiftly to restore trade with the Netherlands and Spain (the convention of Nijmegen, March 1573). Thereafter he retained a close control over negotiations with the Netherlands, seeking to mediate a settlement between Philip and the rebels, rather than give open support to Orange. On the other hand Walsingham had had close Orangeist connections since 1571 and they clearly saw him as a sympathetic figure. When in December 1575 a delegation from the states of Holland and Zeeland offered Elizabeth the sovereignty of the provinces, Walsingham apparently warned them they were wasting their time. However, several months later, when a crisis developed over the Dutch attempt to prevent the English trading with Antwerp, he was instrumental in arranging a settlement between Orange and the queen. A major transformation occurred in autumn 1576, when the success of the revolt, coupled with the arrival of the new governor-general, Don John of Austria, widely believed to be planning the liberation of the queen of Scots, converted Elizabeth to a policy of defending the <i>status quo</i>.<br>
<br>This time, however, there was no trusting the French crown: indeed the outbreak of the sixth War of Religion in spring 1577 revived suspicions (shared by Walsingham) that there was indeed a Catholic league. This assessment contained a fatal flaw that would cause Walsingham major problems in formulating policy towards France. Despite his flamboyant Catholic devotion Henri III (the former duc d'Anjou), once firmly on the throne, had no interest in foreign adventures and was a great admirer of Elizabeth. Walsingham never fully appreciated this, and, being fed appraisals of French politics by his Huguenot friends such as Philippe Duplessis-Mornay, who were obsessed by the supposed ambitions of Henri Guise, third duc de Guise, constantly overrated his influence on the king.<br>
<br>The events of 1577 also showed that there would not be much help from the German princes either. By the end of the year, as relations between the states general of the United Provinces and Don John deteriorated, the issue became one of unilateral intervention. This caused an important division of opinion between Burghley and Walsingham, especially after the defeat of the states' army by Don John at Gembloux on 31 January 1578. Burghley was doubtful of Dutch political coherence and considered a mediated settlement the best way out, while Walsingham, supported by William Davison, then agent in the Netherlands, as well as by Bacon, argued that the strength of the Dutch cities would, with adequate assistance, make a reconquest impossible. However, the risks of full-scale war with Spain were heightened when Morton was dismissed as regent of Scotland on 12 March, while Sir Thomas Stukeley was preparing an expedition for Ireland in Italy and Spain. In these circumstances Elizabeth decided to send only limited military and financial assistance to the Netherlands to stabilize the situation and encourage a mediated settlement, while keeping a larger expedition in reserve.<br>
<br>It was at this point (February and March 1578) that Alen&ccedil;on, now duc d'Anjou, launched his own eccentric version of Coligny's 1571 Netherlands enterprise. Although he had shown recurrent interest in a Netherlands enterprise since 1576 his behaviour in the sixth War of Religion had discredited him and he was notoriously at odds with his brother. The latter aspect of the Anjou enterprise was crucial, as Walsingham noted immediately, writing to Davison on 28 March that: &#145;[I] cannot tell what to make of his dealings with the States being divided as he is from the French king without whose aid he shall not perform anything&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 19398, fol. 88<i>r</i>). On the other hand Henri's ultimate intentions proved almost impossible to penetrate, and Walsingham's deep suspicion of the French crown led him to assume the worst: &#145;it will behove the Prince [Orange], therefore, to look substantially into the matter and not to forget the late accident on St Batholomew's Day&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 1.377).<br>
<br>Elizabeth's initial response was to try to keep Anjou out of the Netherlands by threatening to withdraw all assistance if the Dutch negotiated with him, but he bullied his way into discussions in April. In May she adopted a dangerous two-pronged approach. A special embassy was to be sent to the Netherlands to assess the situation, while she sought to divert Anjou by dangling marriage before him&#151;this was communicated to the French ambassador, Castelnau de Mauvissi&egrave;re, through Sussex. Leicester wanted to head the embassy, but instead Elizabeth chose Walsingham, despite his objections (possibly on grounds of health), together with William Brooke, tenth Baron Cobham. Their instructions were drafted on 12 June and they arrived at Dunkirk on the 23rd.<h2>
<a name="TheAnjouepisode15781581"></a>The Anjou episode, 1578&#150;1581</h2>At the beginning of June the Holy Roman emperor, Rudolph II, suddenly offered to mediate a settlement in the Netherlands. As a result the Walsingham&#150;Cobham embassy was instructed first to persuade Don John to agree to the imperial mediation. If unsuccessful, they were to co-ordinate the defence against him, including Anjou if he was prepared to co-operate. Last, if necessary, Elizabeth would send major English assistance, particularly if Anjou allied with Don John, a recurrent fear during spring and summer, for it was widely known that Catherine had tried to marry him to one of Philip's daughters. Including Anjou in the defence of the Netherlands, rather than diverting him, was a recent and major concession.<br>
<br>Walsingham and Cobham arrived in grand style, Walsingham's own expenses for the embassy coming to &pound;1298 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. They were lavishly entertained by the Dutch when they reached Antwerp on 1 July, not entirely to Walsingham's taste, but much to the chagrin of Anjou's penniless agents. Their ambassadorial train also included a number of military officers, whose role was to assess the strength of the Dutch towns. Walsingham found his earlier assumptions justified, as he wrote to Leicester on 14 July 1578: &#145;the more I consider of the state of this country the harder I find it for the King of Spain ever to recover the full possession thereof, unless God should take away the Prince [of Orange], whose advice they cannot well spare, though their towns by the new fortifications be made impregnable&#146;  (Kervijn de Lettenhove, 10.588). Otherwise the embassy was difficult and awkward, exacerbated by the plague epidemic that killed Don John on 1 October. The military situation did stabilize when, on 1 August, Don John attacked the states' camp at Rijmenamt and was fought off, the English contingent playing a distinguished role. However, in mid-July Anjou himself arrived secretly at Mons, demanding a conclusion to his treaty with the states general. At the same time he sent agents to Elizabeth offering to place himself at her disposal and confirming his desire to marry her.<br>
<br>Walsingham had found the states unwilling to treat with Don John and equally unwilling to abandon the treaty with Anjou. This was signed on 28 August, though in practice it meant little. He and Cobham entered a formal protest, but it was difficult to sustain given Elizabeth's reception of Anjou's envoys. However, they finally persuaded the states to send an embassy to Don John, which they and Pomponne de Belli&egrave;vre, whom Henri had sent to impede the Anjou enterprise, accompanied. On 26 August Walsingham had a personal interview with Don John at his headquarters in the village of Perwez near Louvain. Don John refused to negotiate on the terms the states offered, but then several days later (1 September) announced that Philip had accepted Rudolph's mediation. On receipt of this news Elizabeth gave Walsingham and Cobham leave to retire, which they did on 27 September, arriving at Richmond Palace on 7 October.<br>
<br>Walsingham returned deeply frustrated by what he regarded as Elizabeth's failure to seize the opportunity. His own assessment of the situation, which he had argued since the spring, was that the queen should pre-empt Anjou by making a firmer financial and military commitment. When taken with his praise for Orange&#151;he described him to Leicester on 6 July as &#145;the rarest man in Christendom&#146;&#151;it made him the target of criticism (possibly from the French) that he and Orange were conspiring to bounce Elizabeth into taking on the protectorate of the Netherlands. She in turn had made things more difficult for him by negotiating with Anjou directly. How much Walsingham knew about her revival of the marriage before he left for the Netherlands is unclear, but he was certainly informed of it by Leicester at the end of July. Leicester also warned him not to let himself be identified as an open opponent of the marriage. He answered with his often quoted observation that he understood why Anjou would wish to marry Elizabeth, &#145;being as she is the best marriage in her parish&#146;, but he also found the marriage difficult to square with Anjou's place in the French succession, for Henri had publicly admitted earlier in the year that he and his wife would have no children  (BL, Cotton MS Galba C. vi, fol. 94<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>The acceptance by the states general of the imperial mediation, which resulted in the Cologne conference in summer 1579, brought Anjou's enterprise to a halt, much to his frustration. Before Walsingham left the Netherlands, Elizabeth had returned Anjou's agents with a reiteration of her long-established requirement that a personal and informal interview&#151;so that they could assess their mutual compatibility&#151;was essential if the marriage negotiations were to proceed. During the summer there had been much perplexity in England about both Anjou's motives in proposing marriage and Elizabeth's seriousness in entertaining his offers. Leicester assumed her motive was to divert him from the Netherlands, but did not see why he would surrender his ambitions there for something so uncertain. Burghley was worried that a rebuff over the marriage would simply drive Anjou into the arms of Spain. Sussex was the only privy councillor to see the marriage in a positive light, arguing that Henri would not abandon his brother and therefore Anjou was a force to be reckoned with&#151;and that consequently the marriage would make Elizabeth the arbiter of Europe. Walsingham stuck to his assessment that the marriage was ultimately impossible and therefore Elizabeth should not waste her time on it. He wrote to Hatton on 9 October 1578, &#145;I would to God her Majesty would forbear the entertaining any longer the marriage matter. No one thing has procured her so much hatred abroad as these wooing matters, for that it is conceived she dallieth therein&#146;  (H. Nicolas, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Times of Sir Christopher Hatton</span>, 1847, 94).<br>
<br>Anjou did not accept Elizabeth's invitation. Instead he sent his <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, Jean de Simier, baron de St Marc, to negotiate a marriage treaty, despite warnings relayed by Walsingham in November that Elizabeth would not discuss a treaty before the interview. Nevertheless Simier arrived on 6 January 1579 and Elizabeth commissioned Walsingham, together with Burghley, Leicester, and Sussex to treat with him. Simier demanded to negotiate on the basis of the French articles of 1571, only to be told again that the interview must come first. At the end of March Anjou informed Simier that he would come in advance of a treaty, and in turn Elizabeth ordered the English commissioners to discuss the terms. It soon became clear that the English were not prepared to accept the 1571 articles, while the all important religious conditions were held over for discussion at the interview. At the end of April, according to the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza (who was well informed if obviously hostile to Anjou's Netherlands ambitions), Elizabeth asked her privy councillors for an individual written assessment of the marriage. This is the best explanation (as Read, alone of those who have written on the subject, has observed) for the large number of personal memoranda. They survive from Burghley, Sussex, Mildmay, and Wilson, as well as Walsingham  (printed in Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 2.14&#150;18). Only Hatton and Leicester are missing, though Sidney's famous letter to the queen may have been written on his uncle's behalf.<br>
<br>Once again the most outspoken supporter of the marriage was Sussex, who saw it as a diplomatic master-stroke. This provoked a violent reaction from Mildmay. By contrast the difference between the views of Burghley and Walsingham was much narrower. They surveyed many of the same points, both positive and negative, and expressed concern (as did Wilson) that if Anjou were rebuffed over the marriage he would turn to Spain. What tipped Burghley into support was his concern that the marriage was the final chance for an heir of Elizabeth's body, while Walsingham (along with Davison in private correspondence) was both sceptical that she would conceive (she was then forty-six) and worried that she might damage her health as a result. More fundamentally Walsingham continued to argue that Anjou's place in the French succession made the marriage impossible, and his residual suspicion of the Valois caused him to doubt Anjou's sincerity: he considered the wooing of Elizabeth simply a ploy to encourage a counter-offer from Spain.<br>
<br>Whatever their individual opinions the English still had no intention of agreeing a treaty in advance of the interview, which was never certain until Anjou actually arrived on 17 August 1579. His visit coincided with two of a series of external events that reshaped the context of the marriage negotiations over the following years. The first was the landing of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald in Ireland on 18 July, the second the arrival of Esm&eacute; Stewart, sixth seigneur d'Aubigny, at Leith on 8 September. Although fitz Maurice was killed shortly afterwards, his very arrival was evidence of Spanish hostility and made good relations with France all the more important. It also inspired the rebellion of Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, in October, which crippled Elizabeth financially until 1583. Aubigny's motive for venturing to Scotland was actually the private one of securing his rights to the Lennox inheritance, but he was seen (not least by Walsingham) as an agent of the house of Guise, and this strengthened English suspicion of France.<br>
<br>Anjou's interview lasted almost a fortnight (17 to 28 August 1579). He spent the whole time privately with Elizabeth at Greenwich Palace, and what transpired there remains as much a mystery as it was to contemporaries, except that they both expressed public satisfaction with each other's company. In late September Elizabeth took a short progress into Essex, making much of Simier and Mauvissi&egrave;re, but in no hurry to proceed to a treaty. Only after hectoring from Simier did she summon the privy council to discuss the terms. On 6 October twelve privy councillors met: the majority rejected the marriage outright, and the four in favour (Sussex, Burghley, Wilson, and Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon) were not enthusiastic. It took further badgering from Simier for Elizabeth to commission a group of privy councillors to provide him with draft articles in late November. The religious conditions remained unresolved, and the final treaty was to be concluded by a formal embassy from France when Elizabeth summoned it.<br>
<br>Although Walsingham was in attendance during the Essex progress, 4 October was the date of his last recorded presence on the privy council until 24 December, with the exception of 9 November. He thus missed the October debates, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether he was included in the commission that drafted the articles for Simier. The precise cause of his absence remains unclear. There are references in correspondence of late November to improvements in his health, which would suggest that it was another urinary attack. Mendoza, however, reported on 16 October that Elizabeth, greatly irritated with those who opposed the marriage, had told Walsingham &#145;begone and that the only thing he was good for was a protector of heretics&#146;, although he was not sure whether this was all artifice  (Hume, 1568&#150;79, art. 607). On 30 December, just after his return, Walsingham informed the new ambassador in France, Sir Henry Brooke (known as Cobham), that he had &#145;no access of speech to her majesty since my repair to court, being still entertained as a man not thoroughly restored to her favour&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1579&#150;80</i>, art. 112). Yet, when reporting Walsingham's return and the queen's moderating her &#145;tr&egrave;s mauvayse ch&egrave;re&#146; against him and Leicester to Henri on 16 January 1580, Mauvissi&egrave;re referred to his having been &#145;absent y mallade&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 31/3/28, fols. 9<i>v</i>, 10<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Walsingham's absence has inspired speculation about his involvement in John Stubbe's pamphlet <span class="italic">The discoverie of a gaping gulf</span>, which appeared in September 1579. However, no direct connection has ever been discovered. Although many of Stubbe's arguments against the marriage were little different than those advanced by Walsingham earlier, he stridently demanded that the privy council prevent a silly woman making a fool of herself. Elizabeth's hostility to controversy in print was well established, and it is difficult to believe that someone in Walsingham's position did not appreciate that it would only make things worse.<br>
<br>From the end of December 1579 Walsingham was again in regular attendance at court, but it is not known what influence he may have had on Elizabeth's informing Anjou in January 1580 that no religious concessions would be granted. However, the spring of 1580 saw the marriage negotiations transformed by yet further events. The interview had coincided with the failure of the Cologne conference and subsequently Anjou's Netherlands ambitions had revived. By the beginning of 1580 Orange had made clear his intention of repudiating Philip's sovereignty and nominating Anjou instead. The Dutch debate over Anjou had strong similarities to the English one, and Orange deployed the marriage to Elizabeth as evidence of Anjou's bona fides. It was now vital for Anjou to avoid a rebuff in England, even if the continued negotiations were only a pretence. On 31 January the cardinal&#150;king Enriques of Portugal died and Catherine's bizarre yet obsessive interest in the Portuguese succession raised the possibility of a Franco-Spanish contest over Portugal. Lastly, the spring of 1580 saw the outbreak of the seventh War of Religion. Anjou acted as mediator, while simultaneously negotiating with the Dutch, on the assumption that Henri would reward his efforts by supporting his enterprise. The treaty of Plessis-l&egrave;s-Tours (19 September 1580), in which the states general recognized Anjou as their <i>seigneur</i>, was contingent on Henri's commitment, but despite Anjou's lies about having the support of his brother, this was not forthcoming. Nevertheless, in spring 1581 Anjou proceeded with his Netherlands enterprise, focusing in the summer on the relief of Cambrai.<br>
<br>For all Anjou's protestations of allegiance Elizabeth had little control over his actions, except to refuse to proceed with the marriage treaty until peace was made in France. However, in September 1580 the simultaneous return of Francis Drake from the circumnavigation voyage and the landing of the Italian&#150;Spanish relief force in Ireland threatened a new confrontation with Spain. During autumn 1580 Henry Cobham was instructed to hint discreetly at an alliance over Portugal. Henri responded on 28 February 1581 by commissioning a large embassy to conclude the marriage treaty. Henri's motives are still debated: whether he deliberately made marriage to Elizabeth the price of assistance to his brother, counting on her refusal; whether he believed the marriage was necessary to tie the queen into an alliance against Spain; whether the revival of the marriage was yet another attempt to divert his brother from the Netherlands; or (on Catherine de' Medici's part) whether it was intended to divert Anjou from a marriage to Catherine of Bourbon, which she opposed. The spring of 1581 also saw the final session of the parliament of 1572, which tightened substantially the laws against recusancy, possibly as a signal to France that no concessions would be made on religion. Walsingham played his usual minor role, relaying his jaundiced view of parliament to Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon: &#145;otherwise there hath no past any matter of importance, so careful have men been to prefer their private causes before the common benefits of the state&#146;  (Hunt. L., Hastings MS 13062).<br>
<br>The French commissioners arrived on 16 May, Anjou seeking to cross as well but being driven back by bad weather. Walsingham was sceptical about their chances: &#145;the issue of great causes is uncertain &hellip; yet if I can judge anything and others that have some cause to know her majesty inwards, I see no reason to fear the matter&#146;  (Hunt. L., Hastings MS 13066). He was ill at the time of their initial reception, but at a meeting on the 30th he informed the French commission that parliament had expressed considerable opposition to the match and that as a result Elizabeth intended to settle the controversial aspects directly with Anjou. He then hinted that she would be prepared to consider an alliance, only to find that the commissioners were not empowered to negotiate anything other than the marriage. On 11 June a marriage treaty was signed, but the religious clauses and other contentious issues were reserved for settlement between Elizabeth and Anjou.<h2>
<a name="Theembassyof1581"></a>The embassy of 1581</h2>Elizabeth had kept Walsingham at a remove from her communications with Anjou during 1580. He in turn became increasingly fixated by the rise of Aubigny in Scotland. He was convinced from the start that Aubigny was a Guise agent, and by spring 1580 was growing frustrated at the failure to find evidence. For this Cobham was blamed, the source of some hostility to Walsingham thereafter. Walsingham was also certain that Aubigny (first earl of Lennox from March 1580) was intending the overthrow of Morton. However, here he and Burghley made a mistake by seeing Lennox as the sole issue, which could be countered by his removal or (on Morton's advice) by buying James VI with a large subsidy. What they failed to appreciate was the depth of hostility to Morton among James's protestant councillors, the treasurer, William Ruthven, fourth Baron Ruthven, in particular. Morton was arrested on 5 December 1580 on trumped-up charges of complicity in the murder of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley.<br>
<br>The issue was now what could be done to save him. Walsingham, whose loyalty to Morton was unquestioned, argued for military intervention, if necessary. However, his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23122/', "Thomas Randolph (1525/6&#150;1590)")</script> (whom he always referred to as uncle), who was sent to Scotland in early 1581 to assess the situation, undermined the case for intervention by reporting that there was no internal support for Morton's restoration. Elizabeth backed away from formal intervention on an apparent verbal promise from James that he would spare Morton's life. To this Walsingham gave a typical response in a letter to Huntingdon of 5 April: &#145;by which account I see that Scotland is clean lost, and a great gate opened thereby for the loss of Ireland&#146;  (Hunt. L., Hastings MS 13067). James's promise was broken by Morton's execution on 2 June 1581, and it opened a new chapter in Anglo-Scots relations, dominated by Elizabeth's distrust of the adolescent king. Although Mendoza is the source for her denunciation of James as &#145;that false Scots urchin&#146;, Walsingham recalled during his 1583 embassy to Scotland &#145;the impression I have always found that your majesty had of the disposition of this young king &hellip; as your majesty has always doubted, so I think you shall find him most ungrateful&#146; (Hume, 1580&#150;86, 207; <span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 611).<br>
<br>On 22 July, however, Walsingham was sent on an embassy to France that lasted until 21 September. Just after the marriage treaty was signed Henri had informed Elizabeth that he was prepared to consider a full alliance after the marriage was concluded, yet at the same time it was obvious that he was trying to obstruct his brother's Netherlands plans. The basic purpose of the embassy was to discover what he was up to and to keep Anjou's enterprise alive. The complex instructions Walsingham was given reflect the genuine English puzzlement over Henri's intentions. Walsingham tried to escape the embassy, fearing a repetition of 1578, but without success. There was, however, a challenge for him. During the spring he had become increasingly interested in plans for a naval expedition to aid the Portuguese pretender, Dom Antonio, and invested in it himself. In May Dom Antonio had sent an envoy to Elizabeth, who claimed that Henri had promised him assistance. When Elizabeth offered to share the costs the French king replied that he would do so only after the marriage. Walsingham observed to Huntingdon on 29 June, &#145;yt is to be gathered by this could [cold] answer that yf the mariadge take not place, the portugalls can look for no relefe out of France and that the French King will come some other coorse&#146;  (Hunt. L., Hastings MS 13070).<br>
<br>Once in France, Walsingham went first to see Anjou at his crowded headquarters at La F&egrave;re-en-Tardenois on 3 August 1581, where they had to retire to the latter's bedchamber to escape the noise of the courtiers in the adjoining apartment. Here he expressed Elizabeth's concern that the marriage would commit her to an open war with Spain, though she was willing to ally with France and would aid him discreetly. Anjou replied that his brother would do nothing until the marriage was concluded. However, he responded to her promise of assistance by requesting a loan to keep his forces in the field. Walsingham thought this a good way of retaining control of him. Shortly afterwards Walsingham encountered Catherine, who had come to dissuade Anjou from the enterprise and to agree to a Spanish marriage, but he apparently managed to persuade her to support an English alliance. He then went to Paris, where he had his first audience with Henri on 10 August. He found him difficult to pin down, but concluded that without the marriage Henri would not agree to an alliance. On 24 August Elizabeth followed Walsingham's advice by agreeing quickly to the loan Anjou had requested. However, at the same time Walsingham discovered that his negotiations with Henri were being sabotaged by reports from Mauvissi&egrave;re and Anjou's agent Pierre Clausse, sieur de Marchaumont, that Elizabeth would ultimately proceed with the marriage. With this stalemate his embassy came to an end.<br>
<br>Walsingham's expenses had come to &pound;625 19<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., and he returned frustrated that yet another opportunity had been let slip. He blamed Elizabeth for failing to clarify her position over the marriage, for had she been amenable to it the alliance posed no problem. Instead she had given the impression that her only concern was to avoid expenditure, which, using one of the medical metaphors he regularly employed, he argued was impossible: &#145;common experience teacheth that it is hard in a politique body to prevent any mischief without charges as in a natural body diseased to cure the same without pain&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 2.87). On his return he revised his old memorandum of 1571 under a new title, &#145;Whether it be good for her majesty to assist the duke of Anjou in his enterprise of the Low Countries&#146;. Many of the arguments of the earlier memorandum reappeared. Spain was clearly the chief enemy and the Netherlands should not be allowed to return to Philip's allegiance. France was less of a threat, thanks to the Huguenots, and the danger of French annexation of the Netherlands was a hypothetical risk that could be run. With regard to Anjou himself, the old fear that if rebuffed he might turn to Spain remained and therefore his enterprise had to be encouraged and supported. However, the most radical section was a new one that dealt with finance. Walsingham considered that parliament should be acquainted with the reasons for aiding Anjou to pre-empt criticism, and if an open war with Spain followed then &#145;some portion of the Bishops' temporalities may by sale be converted into fee farms&#146; (BL, Harley MS 1582, fols. 38<i>r</i>&#150;41<i>r</i>; Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 2.94). The discreet subsidizing of Anjou was in fact the policy Elizabeth followed in 1582.<h2>
<a name="Principalsecretary15811583"></a>Principal secretary, 1581&#150;1583</h2>On 30 July 1581, just after Walsingham arrived in France, Leicester relayed a message from the queen: &#145;she willed me to say thus unto you that as she doth know her Moor cannot change his colour, no more shall it be found that she will alter her old wont, which is always to hold both eyes and ears open for her good servants&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 2.60). In the letter he wrote to Elizabeth on 2 September, criticizing her for failing to clarify her position, Walsingham replied with laboured jocularity: &#145;the lawes of Ethiopia my native soyle are verie severe against those that condemne a person unheard &hellip; I should then be worthie to receave the most sharpe punishment that either the Ethiopian severitie or Dracus lawes can yeilde&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 6265, fols. 71<i>v</i>&#150;72<i>r</i>). Although&#151;as with all the nicknames that Elizabeth used&#151;the precise origin of &#145;the Moor&#146; is unknown, it marks Walsingham's admission into what was the true &eacute;lite of Elizabethan England, the queen's intimates.<br>
<br>Owing to the loss of his private papers Walsingham's personal life at this point is difficult to detail. He certainly maintained a substantial establishment. From the 1560s his London residence was in Seething Lane, a house that survived the great fire of 1666. The Victorian office block on the site still bears his name. In February 1579 Elizabeth granted him the lease of the manor of Barn Elms in Surrey, close to Richmond Palace, his brother-in-law Beale's house at Barnes, and Dr John Dee's at Mortlake. This became his principal suburban residence. He also had a country house at Odiham in Hampshire. It was to Odiham that he invited Leicester and Warwick for &#145;a Friday night's drinking after the ancient and catholic order&#146; on their return from a journey to Wilton in Wiltshire in November 1578  (Cottrell Dormer MS, MSS letters, 1570&#150;1630, art. 25).<br>
<br>None of Walsingham's houses appears to have been architecturally prepossessing, and nothing remains of any of them. Of all the Elizabethan grandees he seems to have been least interested in creating or leaving behind him a major architectural monument. He was, however, a notable patron of learning, upwards of forty books being dedicated to him, chiefly on religion, philosophy, and exploration. Edmund Spenser wrote a dedicatory sonnet to him in his <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span> (1590), calling him<blockquote>
<div>the great Mecenas of this age,<br>
</div>
<div>As wel to al the civil artes professe<br>
</div>
<div>As those that are inspird with Martial rage.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span>, ed. A. C. Hamilton, 1989, 742)</blockquote>Walsingham's clearest personal tastes were for gardening (an interest that he shared with Leicester and Burghley), falconry, and music. The composer John Cosyn dedicated his work <span class="italic">Musike of six, and five partes</span> to him in 1585. Walsingham also employed the young lutenist and composer Daniel Bacheler, whose apprenticeship was signed over to him in June 1586 and who composed various works for mixed instruments for him.<br>
<br>The most famous of all the books dedicated to Walsingham was the first (1589) edition of Richard Hakluyt's <span class="italic">The principall navigations</span>. His interest in exploration may have been a product of his early association with the Russia Company. He supported Martin Frobisher's three attempts to unlock the north-west passage (1576, 1577, 1578) but became more cautious with each venture. If he remained fascinated with the north-west passage it was for strategic rather than commercial reasons, for he hoped it would be a way into the Pacific free from the Spanish. Dee's journal records a conference in 1583 with Adrian Gilbert, John Davis, and Walsingham over the significance of the north-west passage. Walsingham later sponsored Davis's heroic series of voyages deep into the Arctic in 1585, 1586, and 1587.<br>
<br>Walsingham's main rewards from the queen were a series of export licences for cloth (and occasionally wool), beginning in 1574. He received one other office in these years, the honorific dignity of the chancellorship of the Order of the Garter (22 April 1578). At the same time, his stature was also reflected in expanding local influence. He was named of the quorum of the peace for Hampshire about 1573, added to the quorum for Hertfordshire about 1574, promoted <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Hampshire in 1577, and was of the quorum for Surrey by 1579. More significant was the fact that boroughs felt it important to gain his goodwill. Colchester appointed him recorder in 1578, and he was high steward of Salisbury (1581), Ipswich (1581), Winchester (1582), Kingston upon Hull (1583), and King's Lynn (1588).<br>
<br>After the death of Sir Thomas Wilson on 20 May 1581 no second secretary was appointed until 1586, possibly for financial reasons. As a result Walsingham's own informal secretariat expanded dramatically and was at the centre of many of his subsequent activities. He relied heavily on Beale, who, although clerk of the privy council, deputized for him during his embassy in Scotland in 1583. His immediate team of secretaries included Francis Mylles, who had been in his service since 1566, Laurence Thomson, who entered his service about 1575 and served as his secretary in the Netherlands embassy of 1578, and lastly Nicholas Faunt, who was in his service from 1578. They were later joined by Lake and possibly Thomas Edmondes. When Walsingham became secretary there was an established coterie of diplomatic agents, including Killigrew and Randolph, but however personally close, they were of an older generation. The first of his own prot&eacute;g&eacute;s to follow a diplomatic career was Davison, who may have been with him in the French embassy of 1571&#150;3. In the 1580s he relied increasingly heavily on more shadowy figures: Edward Burnham, Francis Needham, and Walter Williams. Burnham, Williams, and his Italian agent, Manucci, were all with him in the Netherlands in 1578. It was this rather loose organization that Beale later criticized  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 1.427).<br>
<br>On 21 September 1583, while Walsingham was in Scotland, his surviving daughter Frances married Sidney, and as part of the marriage arrangement they lived in Walsingham's home. Walsingham had known Sidney since 1572, and in political terms the marriage appeared to reflect the ties between him and Sidney's uncle Leicester. Yet Sidney's father, Sir Henry Sidney, had been unhappy, relating in a famous prolix account of his life that he lacked the estate to endow his son sufficiently, while Elizabeth was annoyed at not being consulted first. However, Walsingham cherished Sidney's intelligence, and Sidney's steady emergence as a political figure in 1584&#150;5 took place under his tutelage as well as Leicester's. By spring 1585 he too was deputizing for Walsingham during his repeated illnesses.<br>
<br>Walsingham's religious allegiances, on the other hand, are puzzling. As early as 1574 la Motte-F&eacute;n&eacute;lon labelled him a puritan, by which he meant an ally of the Huguenots; the term was also used by the queen of Scots to identify her enemies and by Spanish agents to identify Orange's sympathizers. There is evidence of Walsingham's assistance to individual puritan divines, and he left &pound;100 in his will for a lectureship for John Reynolds at Oxford. However, John Foxe is the only prominent author found in the twenty or so books on religious subjects dedicated to him. The only other noteworthy feature is the dedication to him of a number of polemics against the Jesuits during the early 1580s, which may reflect active encouragement on his part.<br>
<br>Read was struck &#145;by the almost complete absence of any evidence revealing a disposition on his part to support the puritan movement in his conduct of office&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 2.262). While Davison, Beale, Tomson, and Faunt, and others close to him, were famously outspoken on the subject, his own caution and discretion are summed up by his warning to Davison: &#145;I would have all reformations done by public authority. It were very dangerous that every private man's zeal should carry sufficient authority of reforming things amiss&#146;  (ibid., 265). On the other hand his proposals for the sale of temporalities in 1581 and his disparaging description of the bishops as &#145;assez refroidis&#146; to a Genevan envoy seeking a loan in 1582&#150;3 are revealing. This hostile attitude to the episcopate helped to shape the defence of the church that John Whitgift mounted after his appointment as archbishop of Canterbury in 1583.<h2>
<a name="ThequeenofScots15811584"></a>The queen of Scots, 1581&#150;1584</h2>Walsingham's embassy of 1581 had an unexpected side effect. In Paris he had learned of &#145;the association&#146; from Archibald Douglas, a Church of Scotland minister accused of involvement in Darnley's murder who had fled to France after Morton's fall. This was the response of the queen of Scots to the new situation in Scotland, a plan for restoring relations with her son, in which she would recognize him as king if he revoked her demission (abdication) of 1566 and ruled jointly with her. Walsingham also learned of the mission of the Jesuit William Crichton (or Creighton) to Scotland, though not its full import. It was this conjuncture that inaugurated his career as a spymaster.<br>
<br>Various English attempts to persuade Mary to clarify her relations to her son met with hints that she knew more than she was prepared to let on and that she had extensive contacts in Scotland. Her attitude confirmed Elizabeth's and Walsingham's suspicions of James and underlined the pressing need to separate him from Lennox. Lennox was finally excluded from James's presence on 23 August 1582, by what is known as the Ruthven raid, in which supporters of Ruthven (now first earl of Gowrie) kidnapped the king. After Morton's execution his nephew Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus and later sixth earl of Morton, and a few supporters had gone into exile in England, and Walsingham has been widely suspected of instigating this conspiracy through them. However, the lack of control the English had over subsequent events in Scotland suggests the opposite. The cause lay in Lennox's attempts to revive the episcopate, which had alarmed both the kirk and the protestant nobility.<br>
<br>The Ruthven raid provided Walsingham with two key pieces of intelligence: evidence of discussions about the Association between agents of Mary and James in Paris in autumn 1581 (with Henri's apparent approval), and evidence that Mauvissi&egrave;re had been informing Lennox about English contacts with Angus and with Lennox's enemies in Scotland. The latter Mauvissi&egrave;re had obtained from Archibald Douglas, who had followed Walsingham to England and cultivated Angus. Mauvissi&egrave;re had managed to turn Douglas by offering Mary's help in obtaining a pardon for him for his role in Darnley's murder. The full details are difficult to establish because there are large gaps in Mauvissi&egrave;re's surviving correspondence after June 1581.<br>
<br>This evidence of French duplicity, despite Elizabeth's assistance to Anjou, led Walsingham to treat Mauvissi&egrave;re as a legitimate target. He was able to turn Douglas into a double agent (apparently by threats to send him back to Scotland to stand trial) and in spring 1583 gained the services of the mysterious Henry Fagot, a member of Mauvissi&egrave;re's household. By the end of 1583 he had also suborned one of Mauvissi&egrave;re's secretaries, who provided him with drafts of much of the French ambassador's correspondence. In 1991 and 1999 John Bossy published two detailed accounts of this intelligence operation in which he argued that Fagot was none other than Giordano Bruno, and showed how much can be reconstructed of Walsingham's intelligence work from the elliptical, unsigned, and encrypted records that remain. There were further ramifications. Because Mauvissi&egrave;re acted as agent for the French crown with the imprisoned Mary, Walsingham was able to tap into her correspondence as well. From Fagot, and possibly others, he also learned in early 1583 that Lord Henry Howard was an informant of Mendoza. This is confirmed by Mendoza's own reports. Following a row with Elizabeth in September 1580 over Drake's circumnavigation voyage Mendoza visited the court on only one further occasion, and all his information on English court politics came from Howard.<br>
<br>Although this intelligence operation was to yield major rewards over time, the immediate situation in Scotland deteriorated. Lennox was forced to retire to France at the end of 1582 (he died there shortly afterwards), but James openly resented the Ruthvenites and the question of his understanding with his mother remained. To solidify their position the Ruthvenites turned to England for help, not simply for money, but to pacify James by granting him the English lands of his grandfather Matthew Stewart, thirteenth earl of Lennox. There was, however, a rival claimant, his cousin Lady Arabella Stuart, whose interests Elizabeth was not prepared to sacrifice. Elizabeth's attitude alienated Colonel William Stewart, who engineered James's escape from the Ruthvenites on 29 June 1583.<br>
<br>The dismissal of Gowrie and the restoration of Lennox's former ally, James Stewart, earl of Arran, soon followed James's escape. The resurrection of Arran was the cause of what became Walsingham's final embassy, his mission to James from 13 August to 21 October 1583. Because of his poor health he travelled slowly. Prior to his audience with the king at Perth on 8 September, he decided to take a high line: &#145;the best way to make them seek her majesty is make little account of them&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 2.211). He lectured James on his choice of privy councillors, and when James responded that he was an absolute king, he told him he was too young to make serious political decisions. At a second interview he returned to the theme, criticizing James for the destruction of &#145;so well-deserving a servant&#146; as Morton, and refusing to meet Arran  (ibid., 2.217).<br>
<br>Although he considered James's hostile response proof that he was operating on his mother's advice Walsingham very quickly appreciated that he had perhaps overreached himself, for he had only exacerbated the king's resentment. He had also miscalculated about Arran, who, if mercenary, was a committed protestant. Arran's response was what Walsingham soon dubbed the &#145;by-course&#146;. This was a complaint to Elizabeth through Hunsdon, the governor of Berwick, that Walsingham had slandered James. James was not in league with his mother and wished friendship with Elizabeth, but he also intended to discipline the protestant nobles and the kirk. Walsingham considered the by-course a device of Mary's that Hunsdon was too na&iuml;ve and ambitious to appreciate, and Elizabeth remained too suspicious of James to be convinced by it.<br>
<br>About the time that Walsingham left for Scotland, the privy council caught the first glimpses of what became known as the Throckmorton plot, in particular the visit to England of the Roman Catholic exile Charles Paget in August and September to canvass support among the nobility for a landing by the duc de Guise on the south coast. This was a revision of an earlier plan to free Mary discussed between Crichton and Lennox at Dalkeith in March 1582. The plot was broken on 4 November 1583 with the arrest of Francis Throckmorton, who had acted as a confidential messenger between Mary, Mauvissi&egrave;re, and Mendoza. Papers found in Throckmorton's possession and his own confession (possibly under torture) in December incriminated Lord Henry Howard, Philip Howard, thirteenth earl of Arundel, and Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland, all of whom were arrested, while Thomas Paget, third Baron Paget, and Charles Arundell fled to France.<br>
<br>There are still several unexplained aspects to this affair. Throckmorton, who was the crown's only witness, was tried on 20 May 1584 and executed on 10 July, yet no proceedings were undertaken against the peers, who simply remained in prison. Mendoza was expelled in January 1584 for refusing to hand over papers Throckmorton had left with him, and diplomatic contact between England and Spain came to an end. Yet no action was taken against Mauvissi&egrave;re, who was far more deeply involved. John Bossy has supplied the reason here. Walsingham was tapping Mauvissi&egrave;re's correspondence through his suborned secretary and had no desire to see him depart. Lastly, there was Walsingham's own role. His agents, Fagot among them, provided the information on the comings and goings in Mauvissi&egrave;re's residence, yet Walsingham did not return from Scotland until a fortnight before Throckmorton's arrest. Burghley in fact supervised much of the investigation.<br>
<br>The most important consequence of the plot was its apparent confirmation of an &#145;enterprise of England&#146; to replace Elizabeth with the queen of Scots, in which Spain, the papacy, the Jesuits, the Guise, some Scots, and possibly Mary herself were involved. The enterprise provides the leitmotif for English policy in 1584&#150;5. In the immediate term it caused an invasion panic in January 1584, which a month later inspired a naval treaty with Orange, the first of the many steps that drew England and the United Provinces closer together and lay behind the Dutch participation in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Walsingham, who was ill in bed between 8 February and 10 March 1584, drafted the treaty.<h2>
<a name="FranceScotlandandtheNetherlands15841585"></a>France, Scotland, and the Netherlands, 1584&#150;1585</h2>The wider diplomatic response to the Throckmorton plot dogged Walsingham for the next four years. This was his awkward relationship to the most controversial of Elizabethan ambassadors, Sir Edward Stafford, who was appointed to succeed Cobham as resident at the French court on 15 September 1583. Stafford's French was fluent, he was socially at ease in the French court, and he had been Elizabeth's preferred confidential agent with Anjou since 1578. He was also married to Leicester's former mistress, Douglas Sheffield, dowager Baroness Sheffield. He was not Walsingham's first choice, but as so often happened the others on the shortlist were not available. Walsingham considered his doubts about the new ambassador confirmed when in December Stafford and his wife entertained her cousin Arundell at the Paris embassy, claiming to be ignorant of his reasons for leaving England. During 1584 relations between the two rapidly descended into mutual bickering, Walsingham accusing Stafford of wasting money and laziness, Stafford complaining at Walsingham's constant carping and criticism. There was also an issue of substance. Walsingham never lost his residual suspicion of the French royal family, while Stafford appreciated that however bizarrely Henri behaved he was determined to maintain his independence of action and was no pawn of the Guise.<br>
<br>The situation in 1584 has supplied considerable evidence for students of Elizabethan faction. Even before he left for France, Stafford had ostentatiously sought Burghley's protection, and thereafter sent him copies of his reports to Walsingham. At the same time Hunsdon turned to Burghley for support for the by-course in Scotland. Yet for all Burghley's encouragement of their confidence, there is no evidence that the lord treasurer was actively pursuing different policies from Walsingham's. It is dangerous to argue from archival survival, but a secret correspondence between Stafford and Burghley does not survive, and apart from complaints about Walsingham, the copies of his reports that Stafford sent to Burghley contain no additional material. By the same token, Walsingham was fully aware of Hunsdon's progress with the by-course. The explanation may be that Burghley, aware of Walsingham's temper, was simply keeping the options open.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1584 Scotland posed the more immediate problems. In spite of Walsingham's warnings, at the end of 1583 James had the Ruthven raid condemned as treason by a convention of estates, and those involved were ordered into exile. In response Andrew Melville denounced James as a tyrant and Gowrie and his allies mounted a hasty rebellion in spring 1584. Gowrie was captured immediately and executed on 3 May. Angus and John Erskine, second earl of Mar, briefly occupied Stirling Castle (17 to 23 April) and then fled to England followed by a substantial body of ministers. All later acknowledged the generous treatment they received from Walsingham. At the time James claimed that the English had instigated the rebellion, but there is no reliable evidence for more than vague foreknowledge. There was, however, a rapid response in which Davison was sent to aid the lords in their effort to remove Arran, with instructions drafted by both Walsingham and Burghley. However, they had abandoned Stirling before he reached Berwick. It is revealing of the depth of Elizabeth's distrust of James that unusually for her she defended the exiled lords against his accusations of treason.<br>
<br>Given this stalemate the by-course revived, with Arran now offering to restore amity between Elizabeth and James. Elizabeth responded with charges that James had wronged her by making the Association with his mother and demanded that to prove his bona fides he should reveal all he knew of the plots against her. This Arran agreed to do in a personal meeting with Hunsdon, but Walsingham confided to the exiled Scottish minister James Carmichael that &#145;he lukit that his [Hunsdon's] injunctions being so strait, and not satisfied fullie, sould compt himself to haif bin trompit with fair words in tyme bypast&#146;  (&#145;Letters and papers of Mr. James Carmichael&#146;, 415). The meeting took place at Foulden church near Berwick on 13 August, and was reported by Hunsdon to Walsingham the next day. Arran promised that Patrick Gray, master of Gray, whom he intended to send to England, would reveal all to Elizabeth. The queen was underwhelmed.<br>
<br>Concerning Mary herself there was the practical issue that she had to be removed from Shrewsbury's custody after he had been compromised by his wife's denunciations of his relations with her. At the beginning of the year Elizabeth had intimated that in view of the revelations of the Throckmorton plot and events in Scotland she was unwilling to discuss Mary's release any longer. Mary had responded by claiming that she still wished to negotiate, and in May she was asked to demonstrate her goodwill by mediating the return of the exiled lords to Scotland. Mary, however, demanded her release first. It was in these circumstances that she was moved from Sheffield in September, still claiming that James had agreed to be ordered by her in all things.<br>
<br>In summer 1584 greater matters intruded with the death of Anjou on 10 June, and then the assassination of Orange on 10 July. Their deaths initiated both the crisis over the fate of the Dutch revolt and the even greater crisis over the French succession. In the face of the bold exploitation of Dutch political disunion by Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, in 1583, during the spring of 1584 Elizabeth had been encouraging Henri to back his brother more effectively. What he would do after his brother's death was now the question, but Henri was more than usually elusive and more concerned with reaching an agreement with Henri of Navarre that would pre-empt Catholic opposition to a protestant succession. Yet at the same time he sent mixed signals to the Dutch over whether he would support them in the crisis surrounding the siege of Antwerp. Finally in August he sent Roch de Sorbies, seigneur de Pruneaux, Anjou's former agent, to The Hague to announce that he would accept an offer of sovereignty. Stafford had great difficulty in supplying solid information during these months, which merely increased Walsingham's doubts about him, especially as he himself was reading Mauvissi&egrave;re's mail.<br>
<br>Walsingham was convinced that Elizabeth could not abandon the Dutch whatever happened, a case he argued in a memorandum on 14 July: &#145;Points to be considered touching the peril that may grow by Spain when he shall have full possession of Holland and Zeeland&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Galba C. viii, fols. 94<i>r</i>&#150;95<i>r</i>). In August the states of Holland and Zeeland, who were unhappy about accepting the French king, appealed to Elizabeth to take them under protection, but her preference was for a joint intervention with Henri. Her response encouraged a majority of the provinces to accept the French offer, a process concluded by early October.<br>
<br>At the same time Walsingham scored another major intelligence coup. On 23 August Crichton was caught by a routine Dutch naval patrol on a voyage to Scotland, carrying various papers in English and Italian about a great enterprise against England. The local Dutch commander sent these to Walsingham, and he immediately responded by sending a warship to bring Crichton to England. By 14 September he was lodged in Walsingham's house. What Crichton possessed was a copy of the old Lennox invasion plan of 1582, which Walsingham immediately recognized lay behind the Charles Paget&#150;Throckmorton scheme of 1583. Walsingham also learned that &#145;the Scottish Queen was made privy&#146;, but that &#145;the French king hath no way been a party in them, which ought to move the queen the rather to accompt of his friendship&#146;. Last, and most important, according to Crichton, the enterprise was merely suspended, and would be put in execution &#145;when the king of Spain shalbe ridde of his low cuntryes trowbles&#146; (<span class="italic">State Papers and Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler</span>, 2.400&#150;01; TNA: PRO, SP 12/173/13; BL, Cotton MS Caligula C. ix, fol. 133<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Crichton's revelations lay behind two major decisions taken in mid-October. A full-scale meeting of the privy council was held on the 10th, which agreed that Elizabeth could not afford to let the Netherlands collapse, and would need to intervene unilaterally if the French did not. This would involve making a settlement with Scotland. The other was the bond of association, signed by the privy council on 19 October. In contrast with the records of the discussion over the Netherlands, no memoranda concerning the bond have survived, nor was it mentioned in the privy council discussions of the 10th. The bond committed its signatories to defend Elizabeth's life and &#145;pursue, aswell by force of armes, as by all other meanes of revenge, all maner of persons, of what estate soever they shalbe &hellip; that shall attempt &hellip; the harme of Her Majesties Royall Personne&#146;. Members swore &#145;to prosecute such person or persons to the death, with joint or particular forces; and to take the uttermost revenge on them &hellip; for their utter overthrowe and extirpation&#146;, and no pretended successor by whom or for whom the queen's assassination was attempted or committed would be accepted  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/174/1, fols. 4<i>v</i>&#150;5<i>r</i>). Its origins can be found in various proposals by Burghley, some dating back to the 1560s, and in an advice to Elizabeth written by Leicester earlier in 1584. Burghley and Walsingham were responsible for drafting it, and Burghley, Walsingham, and Leicester took responsibility for its circulation.<br>
<br>The targets of the bond were Mary and James; ironically Mary was allowed to sign it at her own request. Its title was an equally ironic&#151;not necessarily conscious&#151;reference to Mary's and James's Association. Yet it quickly became superfluous, thanks to the arrival of Gray early in November. Gray was expected to conclude the by-course by revealing the plots, which he did not in fact do. But he did dissociate James from his mother, and also offered to overthrow Arran, apparently out of revenge for the execution of Gowrie, who was a relative of his. In the course of his embassy he forged social links with Leicester, Sidney (who became a personal friend), and Walsingham. Thanks to Gray a new Scottish policy was formulated in winter 1584. Once James abandoned his mother, negotiations with her ceased, and in January 1585 she was moved to Tutbury, Staffordshire, with her communications severely restricted. After John St John, second Baron St John of Bletso, escaped appointment as her governor, Sir Amias Paulet was named in April. The new relationship with James was initially more difficult. Gray brought with him his allies Sir Lewis Bellenden of Auchnoll and Sir John Maitland of Thirlestane. However, the Scottish exiles distrusted Gray, and getting James to accept their return would not be easy.<br>
<br>Overshadowing the Scottish situation was the Netherlands. English policy was in suspension until Henri had decided whether to accept the offer of sovereignty, and Davison was sent to The Hague in November as an observer. Walsingham, who was ill again in December 1584 and January 1585, had been sceptical all along that the French king would ever accept, but Elizabeth, now aware that Henri had no interest in joint intervention, wished to prevent the French from acting independently. The tension boiled over in a spat with Burghley, in which Walsingham initially accused him of opposing his suit for the customs farm of the outports, though later accepted his &#145;playne manner of proceading&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/176/19, fol. 34<i>r</i>). The news that Henri had in the end rejected the Dutch offer reached England on 6 March 1585, and the response was swift. A privy council meeting was held on the 8th, and on the following day Burnham was sent to Davison with an offer of English assistance.<br>
<br>This offer was presented formally to the states general on 30 March, and the provinces were then consulted. By the beginning of May all except Zeeland had agreed. Zeeland delayed the embassy for nearly a month, and when it finally departed it had a difficult voyage and did not reach England until 23 June. The negotiation of the two treaties of Nonsuch took place over the next month and a half, conducted largely by Burghley and Walsingham on Elizabeth's behalf. The contract, as the treaties became known, was hastily drafted, and this was one cause of the Anglo-Dutch tensions of the following two years. Not the least of the reasons was that it was not the only major diplomatic issue of those months. In May Walsingham's cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30000/', "Edward Wotton, later first Baron Wotton (1548&#150;1628)")</script>, was sent to James to negotiate a new relationship, and Walsingham's correspondence with him provides a valuable running commentary on the Nonsuch treaty.<br>
<br>What complicated the Scottish negotiations was Gray's decision in June to arrange Arran's assassination. This Walsingham and Leicester thought a course unduly &#145;<i>bluddy</i> &hellip; wherunto that <i>nation</i> is overmiche bent&#146;  (Bain, 2.648). They felt that English complicity, or even the appearance of it, would compromise Elizabeth's position with James. Instead Walsingham was prepared to accept a settlement in Scotland in which Arran was permitted to remain but watched closely by Gray and his allies, with either a tacit or an overt alliance with England. However, Gray was not so easy to control. On 22 June it was reported that there was great &#145;disdaining&#146; between Arran and Gray, who was attempting to draw the king from the earl's influence while creating a league against him  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1584&#150;5</i>, 498). Walsingham, seeing a personal victory many months in preparation now slipping away, was privately angry: &#145;I have bestowed a great deale of care and cost in vayne; and therefor I am now fully resolved [not] to have any further dealyng therein than as the rest of my colleags&#146;  (Bain, 2.694).<br>
<br>In the event, the fortuitous death in a border fracas of Francis Russell, Lord Russell, on 27 July during a day of truce attended by Arran led to the toppling of the earl's regime. Russell's death was exploited adeptly by Gray and Wotton, who claimed that Arran planned it to disrupt the amity between Elizabeth and James. By early November Angus, Mar, and the exiles were at Stirling, and Arran panicked and fled west. In spring 1586 Randolph returned to Scotland to negotiate the league with England, which was signed by Roger Manners, fourth earl of Rutland, on behalf of Elizabeth at Berwick on 2 July 1586. James was now formally allied in return for a pension of &pound;4000, and at least a fa&ccedil;ade of a friendly government in Scotland was restored.<br>
<br>Henri's rejection of the Dutch offer of sovereignty was in part a response to a Guise-led revolt in France in spring 1585. In the summer, partly under pressure from his mother, he reached an agreement with the Guise, but at the price of revoking the edicts of toleration and thereby provoking Huguenot resistance, the eighth War of Religion. Navarre sought assistance from Elizabeth in June and July 1585. Much to the anger of the Huguenots the queen would provide only limited aid, given her commitments in the Netherlands, and they were encouraged to seek further help from the German protestants. At this point a significant disagreement broke out between Walsingham and Stafford. Walsingham was convinced that Henri had finally showed his true colours and that there was now an active international Catholic league. Stafford, acutely enough, reported to Burghley on 5 July that, whatever the appearances, &#145;there is great heartburning and mistrust between the King and them [the Guise] which wille never be quenched&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/14/30). Walsingham was furious, insinuating, &#145;I should be abused and by thatt meanes abuse her majestie concerning theire procedynges&#146;, not least because it gave Elizabeth a counter to his case that Navarre needed full-scale assistance  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/14/15).<h2>
<a name="TheoutbreakofwarwithSpainandfinalyears15851590"></a>The outbreak of war with Spain and final years, 1585&#150;1590</h2>The eighteen months from summer 1585 were probably the most dramatic of Walsingham's life, but the strains undoubtedly caused a serious deterioration of his health and helped to bring on his death. After the Nonsuch treaty was concluded Leicester departed for a holiday at Kenilworth. Walsingham was intending to join him, but cried off at the last minute owing to the bad weather, much to Leicester's disappointment: &#145;I am persuaded that nothing in the world would have done you more good, nor any man in England should be more welcome than yourself&#146;  (Adams, <span class="italic">Household Accounts</span>, 285, 290). He was thus in post when the news of the surrender of Antwerp was received and was able to respond quickly by sending Davison back to the Netherlands with Elizabeth's offer of increased assistance, including Leicester as commander of the English forces. However, this placed Walsingham in the middle of the tensions between Elizabeth and Leicester over the Netherlands. They continued throughout 1586, as Leicester's political and military difficulties increased. At the same time Walsingham knew Elizabeth was following another by-course, by entertaining peace feelers from Parma through Burghley.<br>
<br>However, what dominated 1586 was the destruction of Mary. In September 1585 the replacement of Mauvissi&egrave;re by Guillaume de l'Aubespeine, baron de Ch&acirc;teauneuf, caused Walsingham further to restrict Mary's communications by ordering that all correspondence formerly sent through the French embassy (which he had been reading since 1583) should now be sent through him. At the end of the year Mary was moved from Tutbury (which she hated) to the house of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, at Chartley in Staffordshire. It was at this point that Walsingham devised a scheme to encourage her to re-establish her secret correspondence, probably modelled on his treatment of Mauvissi&egrave;re. A plausible double agent, Gilbert Gifford, presented himself to Mary and the French embassy, claiming to be able to provide a vehicle for communication with the outside world. In a complex intelligence operation, from January 1586 Mary, through letters apparently smuggled in and out of Chartley in beer barrels, was able to read and reply to over a year's backlog of correspondence. All these letters, both incoming and outgoing, passed through Walsingham's office, where they were deciphered by Thomas Phelippes. Through this lethal mechanism Mary replied to Anthony Babington, a gentleman who sought her blessing on 6 July for a genuine, if imprecise, plot on Elizabeth's life. Mary, for whatever reason, perhaps as a result of her many years' imprisonment, compromised herself by conveying assent in a ciphered commission to Babington on 17 July.<br>
<br>On 2 August Phelippes asked Walsingham whether Babington should be arrested, &#145;or otherwise played with&#146;  (Pollen, cl). Walsingham replied the following day, telling Phelippes that &#145;you wyll not beleve howe much I am greved with the event of this cause [an]d feare the addytyon of the postscrypt hathe bread the jealousie&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS, appx L, fol. 144<i>r</i>). By &#145;jealousie&#146; he meant suspicion. Walsingham had added a postscript to Mary's letter to Babington of 31 July, asking him to name the six gentlemen who would assassinate Elizabeth. He now feared that this had made Babington suspicious and risked the entire operation. It shows how carefully he manipulated the situation to entrap Mary. Luckily for Walsingham, in mid-August Babington and his fellow conspirators were arrested. Walsingham balanced the need to use men he trusted with a clear desire not to be associated with the arrests, and wherever possible warrants were issued by other privy councillors. It is not clear that Walsingham expected to uncover an assassination plot of this type, but he had been convinced for years that Mary was at the centre of the enterprise of England, and her apparent willingness to countenance an assassination justified all his suspicions. Walsingham was certain that now was the time to deal with her once and for all. Mary saw through his ploys, and at her trial at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire on 14 and 15 October she formally accused him of engineering her destruction by falsifying evidence. He rose to his feet and denied this:<blockquote>I call God to witness that as a private person I have done nothing unbeseeming an honest man, nor, as I bear the place of a public man, have I done anything unworthy of my place. I confess that being very careful for the safety of the queen and the realm, I have curiously searched out all the practices against the same. (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 3.53)</blockquote>He could have been speaking his credo.The trial was moved to Westminster Palace on 25 October, where the 42-man commission, including Walsingham, found Mary guilty of plotting Elizabeth's assassination. As Walsingham had expected, Elizabeth proved reluctant to execute her rival and prevented a public verdict being decided after the trial. At this point various personal matters intruded. Elizabeth had been generous to him in August 1585 by granting the farm of the customs of the outports, which he had been seeking since the beginning of the year. In September she had eased the secretarial burden by appointing Davison a principal secretary, as well as the Latin secretary, Sir John Woolley, to the privy council. However, during the course of Mary's trial Walsingham learned of the death of Sidney on 17 October 1586 as a result of a wound received at the battle of Zutphen. This brought with it the burden of Sidney's financial affairs, complicated by the recent death of his father, Sir Henry Sidney. Walsingham was faced with honouring &pound;6000 of debts.<br>
<br>Walsingham's request to Elizabeth for further financial assistance to deal with the Sidney debts met a hostile response. Davison said that the queen should aid Walsingham &#145;as one to whom under God she ought to acknowledge the preservacion of her life &hellip; alleaging unto her the hard estate you stand in and the dishonour must fall uppon herself if such a servaunt shuld be suffered to quaile&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/195/54, fol. 99<i>r</i>). Burghley and Leicester (&#145;I confess I see what you find and find like you have found&#146;) added their support, but without success  (BL, Harley MS 285, fol. 266<i>r</i>). With this something snapped and Walsingham retired to Barn Elms in mid-December, transferring the signet and the privy seal to Davison's custody. He did not return to court until 14 February 1587. The combination of personal and political grievance led to a physical collapse: &#145;the grief of my mynd hath brought me into a dangerous dysease&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/197, fol. 6<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>As a result Walsingham was absent from Greenwich when Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant in Davison's presence on 1 February. Her famous sardonic joke that Davison should inform Walsingham, &#145;the grief thereof will go near to kill him outright&#146;, mirrors his own humour  (Read, <span class="italic">Walsingham</span>, 3.63). Yet Walsingham's role was more than passive. By February he had moved to Seething Lane, and when Davison saw him there on the night of the 1st Walsingham arranged for him and Beale to meet the following morning. There they made the arrangements for Beale to convey the warrant to Fotheringhay and for sending the executioner (whom Walsingham had in readiness) in secret  (BL, Add. MS 48027, fol. 636<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). After the privy council signed the order for dispatching the warrant under Burghley's leadership on the 3rd it was sent to Walsingham for his own signature. Although Beale readily undertook the mission, in later years when he was singled out as one of Mary's enemies, he never forgave Walsingham, which helps to account for his tart comments about his brother-in-law.<br>
<br>Mary was executed on 8 February. Walsingham was recalled to court on the 14th and resumed sitting on the privy council on the 15th. Ironically, for all his laments over Sidney, unlike Leicester he did not take part in his funeral at St Paul's Cathedral on the following day. Elizabeth had no doubt of his role in Mary's execution, but she was angrier with Burghley and Davison. Walsingham was in constant attendance until August, when he was &#145;taken with the stopping of my water, as I dispaired &hellip; of recovery&#146;, followed by a fever in September that kept him in bed until mid-December  (BL, Cotton MS Galba D. i, fol. 248<i>r</i>). Ironically, for all his complaints the previous December, Elizabeth gave him several manors in fee farm in April 1587. He also received the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster, vacant following Sir Ralph Sadler's death, on 15 June 1587, although he had to surrender his chancellorship of the Garter to his main competitor, Sir Amias Paulet.<br>
<br>Walsingham's immediate task in February 1587 was to deal with the Scottish and French reactions to Mary's execution. These, as he had half predicted, were muted, although he continued to fret at Elizabeth's refusal to agree to James's demands for the Lennox lands. France proved more complex, owing not least to Walsingham's continued suspicions of Stafford. However, German assistance for Navarre proved difficult to raise, and Elizabeth refused to bear the full burden. As a result the German army under John Casimir of the Palatinate that finally entered France to campaign for Navarre in summer 1587 was both too little and too late. Although Walsingham initially doubted Stafford's claims that Henri had no desire to see Navarre eliminated and was seeking a compromise settlement, during the course of 1587 he slowly came to see some truth in it, although he found the king's inability to take action frustrating. On the other hand he appears to have been ignorant of Stafford's contacts with Mendoza in January 1587.<br>
<br>The most difficult issue was the Netherlands, and here Walsingham engaged in manoeuvres that have puzzled many. The stalemate of the Leicester intervention had caused Elizabeth to take more seriously the peace feelers Parma was sending forth. Walsingham never saw them as more than a smokescreen for the Spanish invasion preparations and a tactic for causing dissension between Elizabeth and the Dutch. On the other hand he was also aware of the collapse in relations between Leicester and the states general and tensions within the English army. On 3 December 1586 he invited Thomas Wilkes, the resident English agent, to write to him confidentially and sent him a cipher, in which Leicester was identified as Themistocles. From Wilkes came a stream of criticisms against Leicester's administration (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1586&#150;7</i>; BL, Add. MS 48127; Brigham Young University, Salt Lake City, Beale&#150;Walsingham state papers). In January 1587 a Dutch delegation arrived both to complain against Leicester and to demand a further increase of Elizabeth's assistance. Her solution was to send Thomas Sackville, first Baron Buckhurst, in March to attempt reconciliation, and from Buckhurst too came a stream of complaints against Themistocles.<br>
<br>In the face of the criticisms and the crippling debts he had incurred in going to the Netherlands in 1585, Leicester wished to resign. Yet in April 1587 the decision was taken to send him back, with the almost paradoxical mission of stabilizing the military situation (in particular the threat to Ostend and Sluys) and persuading the Dutch to co-operate in Elizabeth's peace negotiations. On his arrival at the end of June, Wilkes, Buckhurst, and Sir John Norreys returned to England rather than meet him. For this contempt, Leicester demanded and obtained their imprisonment. In July Walsingham sent his agent Needham to accompany Leicester, and he too sent a stream of criticism using the Themistocles cipher.<br>
<br>There has been much speculation about a cooling of relations between Walsingham and Leicester in 1587. Read, relying on the gossip of Catholic exiles, attributed this not just to Walsingham's doubts about Leicester's competence, but also to personal matters, especially Leicester's refusal to help him over Sidney's debts and opposition to his appointment as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Yet of the latter there is no other proof. The one clear sign of the former was Leicester's distress on learning in July that Walsingham, &#145;one whom the world accompted &amp; he esteemed his dearest friend&#146;, had eased the terms of Wilkes's imprisonment  (BL, Harley MS 287, fol. 37<i>r</i>). It may be significant that Leicester, who had named Walsingham an overseer of his will of 1582, omitted him from the will he was drafting in July 1587. Walsingham clearly regretted the dissensions surrounding Leicester, and may have felt an obligation to Wilkes&#151;for he had observed in 1585 that Leicester was &#145;a shrewde ennemye where he taketh&#146;&#151;but he may have been doing no more than keeping the lines open as Burghley had done with Stafford  (Bain, 2.666).<br>
<br>In autumn 1587 the overwhelming evidence of Spanish invasion preparations heightened the tension over Elizabeth's continued desire to pursue peace negotiations. Walsingham was grateful that his illness prevented her from including him in the delegation. On 12 November he wrote to Leicester:<blockquote>the manner of our cold and carelesse proceeding here in this time of perill and daunger maketh mee to take no comfort of my recoverie of health, for that I see apparently, unlesse it shall please God in mercie and miraculously to preserve us, we cannot long stand. (BL, Cotton MS Galba D. ii, fol. 192<i>v</i>)</blockquote>However, Elizabeth did agree to larger sums being spent on secret intelligence than before; these amounted to &pound;3300 between March 1587 and June 1588.<br>
<br>Walsingham's return to attendance in December 1587 was broken by &#145;a defluctyon into one of my eyes&#146;, which kept him in bed during January 1588, but thereafter he was in constant attendance during the year, except for another illness in October  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;8</i>, 535). He was at the centre of the preparations against the Armada. Although, like everyone else, he was uncertain whether the Armada would ever depart, he was confident that without it there was no threat from Parma's army. Once it arrived in the channel, he informed Henry Radcliffe, fourth earl of Sussex, on 24 July that &#145;we have certainlie discovered that their whole Plott and Desseigne is against the Cittie of London&#146;  (Adams, &#145;Armada correspondence&#146;). His correspondence with Leicester at Tilbury provides one of the best sources for the assessment of the situation at court. He supported Leicester's plan for Elizabeth to visit the army at Tilbury, despite the danger of assassination, and intended himself &#145;to steale to the campe, when her majestie shall be there&#146;, joining the queen on her visit on 8 and 9 August  (BL, Cotton MS Galba D. iii, fol. 227<i>r</i>). Like many others he was frustrated by the failure to achieve a more conclusive victory against the Spanish, lamenting on 8 August &#145;our halfe doings doth breed dishonour, and leaveth the disease uncured&#146;  (T. Wright, <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth and her Times</span>, 2 vols., 1838, 2.385).<br>
<br>In the eighteen months after the Armada, Walsingham's health deteriorated sharply. He was absent from the privy council for almost the entire period from 15 February to 5 June 1589, although he rallied in the latter half of the year and attended until a week before his death. As a result his influence over the shaping of policy diminished. Although he supported the expedition planned by Drake and Norreys in autumn 1588 (afterwards known as the Portugal voyage), he had little to do with its final departure in spring 1589. Perhaps his last important intervention came after Henri's assassination on 1 August 1589, when he urged Elizabeth to support Navarre, now the new protestant king Henri IV. She responded rapidly with a loan of &pound;35,000 and an army of 4000 men under Peregrine Bertie, thirteenth Baron Willoughby de Ereseby.<br>
<br>Walsingham wrote his last will on 12 December 1589, and it was proved on 27 May 1590. It was found in a secret cabinet on the day after his death. The tone is somewhat pessimistic; Walsingham could not resist commenting on the need for God's &#145;mercyfull protection especiallye in this tyme wherein Synne and iniquitie doth so muche abounde&#146;. He stipulated that he should &#145;be buryed without any such extraordinarie ceremonyes as usuallye apperteyne to a man servinge in my place in respect of the greatnes of my debtes and the mean state I shall leave my wife and heire in&#146;. His &#145;moste kynde and lovinge wife&#146; was appointed sole executor and residuary legatee, with Edward Carey, Beale, and William Dodington as overseers  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/75, sig. 33). Their daughter was granted &pound;100 per annum from Walsingham's lands in Lincolnshire in lieu of the dower portion she should have expected from her first husband and on top of the &pound;200 per annum already settled on her. Presumably she would enjoy more land when her mother died. Surprisingly Walsingham had already cleared most of his debts and left his remaining goods, chattels, plate, and jewels to his wife. Yet for all his care with his own estate Walsingham died owing the queen about &pound;42,000, largely from expenditure on the crown's business without obtaining privy seal warrants, or so Beale later claimed. This debt appears to have been waived in James I's reign.<br>
<br>Walsingham died at his house in Seething Lane on 6 April 1590 and was buried in St Paul's in the same tomb as Sidney at 10 o'clock the following evening in a simple ceremony. The tomb was destroyed during the great fire of 1666, and a plaque now commemorates Sidney but not Walsingham. Ursula Walsingham died suddenly at Barn Elms on 18 June 1602 and was buried near her husband after a simple ceremony the next evening.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>Walsingham's stock has fluctuated among historians over the centuries. To the historians of the seventeenth century, including William Camden and Sir Robert Naunton, Burghley and he were the twin pillars of the Elizabethan state. Camden described Walsingham as wise, hard-working, devout, and cunning, with the interests of the realm at heart. Historiography since the nineteenth century has valued Walsingham in terms of its contemporary attitudes to the causes in which he believed: protestantism, a vigorous foreign policy, exploration and empire, suppression of Catholicism in England, destruction of Mary, queen of Scots, union of Scotland and England, and the necessity of espionage. James Anthony Froude's <span class="italic">History of England from the fall of Wolsey to the defeat of the Spanish Armada</span> (1856&#150;70) provided the classic study of Burghley and Walsingham holding together the government despite Elizabeth's incompetence, and created Walsingham's lasting image as her spymaster. In 1899 Sidney Lee wrote in his approving article on Walsingham: &#145;his methods of espionage were worked at the expense of some modern considerations of morality, but his detective weapons were those of England's enemies, and were employed solely in the public interest&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Between 1902 and 1908 Karl St&auml;hlin produced a series of detailed studies of Walsingham, although his planned biography did not go beyond 1573. In 1925 the American historian Conyers Read produced his monumental three-volume study, <span class="italic">Mr Secretary Walsingham and the Policy of Queen Elizabeth</span>, running to nearly 1400 pages. He too approved of his subject's motives and methods. His work was more than just a biographical treatment, and sought to analyse and assess all aspects of Walsingham's role in policy making. Thanks to its scale and the depth of Read's research it has dominated the subject since and discouraged a new substantial biography. Interestingly Read helped to set up, under William J. Donovan, the research and analysis branch of the office of strategic services (the precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency).<br>
<br>Walsingham is now best remembered in the popular imagination for his role as a spymaster, which continues to generate a certain notoriety. His casual and brief employment of Christopher Marlowe as an agent in 1587 still gives rise to implausible conspiracy theories. Above all the Babington plot lives on in the popular memory. The film <span class="italic">Elizabeth</span> (1998), in which Geoffrey Rush memorably portrayed him, put a new spin on the popular image of Walsingham. It was a dazzling, romantic concoction, playing fast and loose with chronology and fact. Walsingham was shown as godless and Machiavellian, as well as homosexual, but the performance did capture his intensity and obsession with the queen's security.<br>
<br>Readers of Walsingham's extensive correspondence gain a sharply critical impression of Elizabethan government, full of complaints about Elizabeth's prevarications and half measures. Despite his conspiratorial reputation he was notoriously indiscreet with those whom he trusted&#151;Davison or Wotton for example. Leicester had to warn him of this habit during his first French embassy in early 1573. One effect of these indiscretions was his constant portrayal of malign and factious forces at work, as he admitted to Burghley during their spat in January 1585, &#145;when I sawe somme cawse to sospect that the grownde therof grewe of factyon (that reyghnethe ordynarylie in coortes)&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/176/19, fol. 34<i>r</i>). As a result he has been a major source for students of Elizabethan faction, especially Read, who concluded that during the period from 1578 to 1587 it dominated Elizabeth's government.<br>
<br>When Read came to his life of Burghley thirty years later he modified his conclusions on faction considerably. Several general observations are worth making. Walsingham had an impulsive streak and never ceased to complain when he felt opportunities were lost. Second, Read focused on the Netherlands and Anjou debates of 1578 to 1585; these were issues of considerable disagreement, but this was not necessarily the case with other areas of policy. Third, the malign forces Walsingham suspected during his embassies of 1578 and 1581 may have been French envoys rather than his colleagues. Last, as sophisticated students of Tudor politics have observed, factions were powerful only when the monarch was weak.<br>
<br>In this respect the most important relationship of Walsingham's career was with Elizabeth. It lacked the long acquaintance of the queen's relationships with Burghley and Leicester and the emotional dependence she placed on Leicester and Hatton. Her tolerance of his constant nagging and complaining has puzzled generations of historians. On the other hand like Burghley, Walsingham was a workaholic, whose efficiency was undoubted and whose sardonic humour mirrored her own. If they disagreed over the Netherlands or Anjou, they were in close agreement over James and Mary. It is possible that Elizabeth accepted retrospectively that she had blundered in accepting James's promise over Morton in 1581, and that Walsingham had been right.<br>
<br>Walsingham's absences during the crucial months in 1579 and 1586 are to some extent the keys to their relationship. The genuine weakness of Walsingham's health has not been fully appreciated, although he had no compunction in using ill health as an excuse for a certain &#145;je m'en foutisme&#146;. Yet, however irritated Elizabeth may have been with him, she made no effort to replace him. This certain distance from the court is also reflected in Walsingham's quite precocious employment of the vocabulary of the state, something not shared by his colleagues.<br>
<br>On the surface Walsingham's views on foreign affairs appear ideological. He never lost his residual suspicion of a Catholic league, the ambitions of the queen of Scots, and (after 1572) the French royal family. His loyalties to foreign protestants were open and sincere. Yet he was no fanatic and his assessments of situations were always balanced. He was right about Anjou, less on ideological grounds than in his appreciation that the duc's motives and behaviour did not make sense.<br>
<br>Perhaps the best way to conclude is with two contemporary comments on Walsingham's death. On 8 April 1590 a Spanish spy in London wrote to Philip with the news, telling him, &#145;Secretary Walsingham has just expired, at which there is much sorrow&#146;. On receiving the letter, the king scribbled in the margin &#145;There, yes! But it is good news here&#146;  (Hume, 1587&#150;1603, 578). On 30 June, when considering the impact of Walsingham's death, Burghley began a letter to a friend, &#145;I am fully perswaded &hellip; the Queen's Majesty, and hir realm, and I and others his particular frendes have had a great loss, both for the publyck use of his good and paynfull long services, and for the privat comfort I had by his mutuall frendship&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 103, fol. 194<i>r</i>).<br>
