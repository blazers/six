<span class="headword">Manship,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1625), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was almost certainly born in Great Yarmouth, the son of Katherine and <a name="cosubject_17997"></a><span class="headword">Henry Manship</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1569), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, freeman of the town, and long considered the author of <span class="italic">Greate Yermouthe: a Booke of the Foundacion and Antiquitye of the Saide Towne</span> (1847) which is now reliably attributed to Thomas Damet. So far as is known, he completed his formal education at the town's free grammar school, though he went on to serve Yarmouth as town clerk from November 1579 to July 1585, as one of four attorneys to the borough court, and in other <i>ad hoc</i> capacities on the borough's behalf. By 1613 he had married Joan, daughter of Henry Hill of King's Lynn and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gourney.<br>
<br>Manship's perpetual pugnacity and even dishonesty plagued him all his life. An unspecified infelicity cost him a royal appointment to a customs post in 1585; he was temporarily dismissed from his burgess-ship in 1604 for calling Yarmouth's two MPs &#145;sheep&#146; and &#145;dunces&#146;; an unauthorized loan in the borough's name placed him under a cloud in 1616; and in 1620 he published a self-serving pamphlet at the borough's expense. The two signal achievements which command attention, Manship's reorganization of the borough's records in 1612 and his completion of <span class="italic">The History of Great Yarmouth</span> in 1619, seem partly intended to restore his favour with the borough's ruling &eacute;lite.<br>
<br>On 16 June 1612 Manship received permission from Yarmouth's borough assembly to establish a committee of aldermen and common councillors to set about the methodical retrieval, description, and reorganization of Yarmouth's official documents, which had become widely scattered both within the borough and far beyond. In twenty-three meetings over two months' time, the committee fulfilled its task. A later transcription of Manship's report on this project  (BL, Add. MS 23737, fols. 4&#150;31) describes this signal achievement in the annals of local record keeping. It did restore his standing, and gained him several <i>ad hoc</i> official assignments on Yarmouth's behalf in the 1610s.<br>
<br>Manship obviously employed his intimate and thorough familiarity with these records in completing his <span class="italic">History</span> in 1619. It was not published until 1854 when the local freeman and antiquary Charles John Palmer transcribed it from a then-extant manuscript copy. No original copies are now known. Manship's <span class="italic">History</span> is remarkable for the breadth of its research in authorities both contemporary and ancient, its critical use of source material, and its polemical support for the rule of magistrates and the law. It illuminates the local identity and history of Great Yarmouth, thus encouraging the loyalty and pride of fellow townspeople. Several copies seem to have circulated from an early time and subsequent local historians such as Henry Swinden and Francis Blomefield relied heavily upon it. The failure to publish it in his own time probably had to do with Manship's personal standing and with the expense of so doing. Though rewarded with &pound;50 for completing the <span class="italic">History</span>, his final disgrace, the offending pamphlet of 1620, seems to have eclipsed his fortunes for the last time. Manship died a relatively poor man in 1625, and was survived by his wife.<br>
