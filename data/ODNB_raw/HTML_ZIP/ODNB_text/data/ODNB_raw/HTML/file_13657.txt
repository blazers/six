<span class="headword">Hone,  Nathaniel</span>  (1718&#150;1784), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 24 April 1718 at Wood Quay in Dublin. He was descended from a family of goldsmiths. His father was Nathaniel Hone, a merchant in Dublin and treasurer of the congregation of Eustace Street Presbyterian Chapel, and his mother, Rebeckah, was the daughter of Samuel Brindley of Staffordshire. Hone, if not self-taught, may have studied with Robert West, who had an art school in St George's Lane. He moved in his youth to England, where he worked as an itinerant portrait painter. In 1742 (February or 9 October) he married Mary (Molly) Earle (<i>d</i>. 1791), a woman endowed with a small fortune, in York Minster. His marriage may have obviated his need to travel, as soon afterwards he settled in St James's Place, London. He produced both oil paintings and miniatures and quickly established a sizeable clientele. His works on enamel are of particularly high quality. Contrary to popular accounts, Hone did not travel to Italy. His younger brother Samuel, also an artist, having been elected a member of the Accademia del Disegno in Florence in September 1752, arranged for Nathaniel to be elected <i>in absentia</i> on 14 January 1753. Nathaniel's application was endorsed by Ignazio Hugford, one of two consuls of the academy.<br>
<br>Hone exhibited a total of twenty-eight paintings at the Society of Artists of Great Britain between 1760 and 1768, was one of the artists who signed a petition for incorporation in 1766, and was among the first directors of the new Society of Incorporated Artists. However, he defected in 1768 to become one of the two Irish foundation members of the Royal Academy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. He was a prolific exhibitor at the academy, showing sixty-nine oil paintings and miniatures there between 1769 and 1784, the year of his death. Hone wished to be identified principally as a painter in oils, and gradually relinquished working on miniatures to concentrate on easel painting. He developed a reputation for irreverence, submitting to the Royal Academy in 1770 a picture of Francis Grose and Theodosius Forrest masquerading as Capuchin monks feasting at a table. The treatment of the subject, which featured one character stirring a bowl of punch with a crucifix, was deemed inappropriate for the academy. Hone agreed to amend the painting for exhibition, but engraved it subsequently in its original state. In 1775 he painted <span class="italic">The Conjuror</span>, a blatant attack on Sir Joshua Reynolds, president of the Royal Academy. It appears that Hone was suspicious of Reynolds's reliance on Italian artistic models for his own work, and also resented his adversary's pre-eminent status among portrait painters. <span class="italic">The Conjuror</span>'s implicit suggestions of plagiarism, and alleged scurrilous references to an intimate relationship between Reynolds and Angelica Kauffman led to its removal, at Kauffman's behest, from the Royal Academy exhibition. Hone denied all allegations and painted out the figure of Angelica Kauffman, but the painting was not reinstated. Hone duly made it the centrepiece of his one-man show, probably the first of its kind, at 70 St Martin's Lane, London, which featured sixty-five other works. Formally entitled <span class="italic">The exhibition of pictures by Nathaniel Hone: mostly the works of his leisure, and many of them in his own possession</span>, the exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue, which itself featured a deliberately pedantic introduction by the artist.<br>
<br>Among Hone's principal sitters were Captain Thomas Baillie; Edmund Burke; John, fourth earl of Bute; Lady Caroline Curzon; Henry, first Earl Digby; Sir John Fielding; Lord Fortescue; Francis Grose; Lord and Lady Middlesex; Frederick, prince of Wales; Horace Walpole; John Wesley; and Signora Zamperini. A large number of his portraits were engraved, often by Hone himself.<br>
<br>Though best-known as a portrait painter, Hone also produced a number of genre paintings, and pictures with theatrical, mythological, and biblical themes, many of which he exhibited. Among these were <span class="italic">The Brickdust Man</span> (exh. Society of Artists of Great Britain, 1760); <span class="italic">Diogenes Looking for an Honest Man</span> (exh. Society of Artists of Great Britain, 1768); and <span class="italic">A Historical Sketch of Nathan in his Reply to David the King</span> (RA; 1783). Hone also executed a large number of self-portraits during his career, both miniatures and easel paintings, in which he presented himself in a variety of guises, from cavalier to country squire. He referred to his wife in a number of his self-portraits by various means, such as the introduction of a relief, an easel portrait in the background, or a miniature. Hone was a mercurial character, but his portraits of other members of his family demonstrate his affection for them. He painted his sons <a name="cosubject_13656"></a><span class="headword">Horace Hone</span>  (1754&#150;1825) and <a name="cosubject_13657"></a><span class="headword">John Camillus Hone</span>  (1759&#150;1836), both of whom became highly accomplished <span class="occ">miniature painters</span> in their own right. Hone's celebrated painting <span class="italic">A Piping Boy</span> (1789; NG Ire.) and <span class="italic">The Spartan Boy</span> (1775; priv. coll.) featured his son John Camillus, and <span class="italic">David the Shepherd Boy</span> (1771) his son Horace. Horace Hone was born in Frith Street, Soho, London, the second son of Nathaniel Hone and Mary. On 19 October 1770 he entered the Royal Academy Schools when his age was recorded as &#145;17 11th Febry next&#146;  (Hutchison, 136), indicating that he was born on 11 February 1754. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1772 to 1822 and was elected an associate of the academy in 1779. In 1782 he went to Dublin, where he established a successful practice, living in Dorset Street. He painted in watercolour and enamel as well as producing engravings. In 1795 he became miniature painter to the prince of Wales. After the union of England and Ireland his practice declined, and he returned to London in 1804. His sitters included the actress Mrs Siddons (NG Ire.), Mrs Elizabeth Prentice, wife of Thomas Prentice of Dublin (enamel, priv. coll.), the fourth duke of Rutland, and Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Daphne Foskett noted that &#145;Hone's style of painting varies a great deal; it is usually elegant and his miniatures of ladies are attractive and well posed&#146;  (Foskett, 568). He was a friend of the painter and diarist Joseph Farington, in whose diary he is mentioned. He suffered from mental health problems from about 1807. Hone died at 20 Dover Street, London, on 24 May 1825, leaving both a widow and a daughter, Sophia Matilda. He was buried in the grounds of St George's Chapel, Bayswater Road, London. A self-portrait by Horace Hone is in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and another in the National Gallery of Ireland. Further examples of his work are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.<br>
<br>John Camillus Hone was a younger son of Nathaniel Hone and studied under his father. He exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Free Society of Artists from 1775 to 1780, after which date he worked in India for about ten years. He was teaching drawing in Calcutta in 1785. Following his return home about 1790 he settled in Dublin, where he became engraver of dies in the stamp office. In October 1807 he married his cousin Abigail (<i>d</i>. 1855), daughter of Joseph Hone of York Street and widow of the Revd John Conolly of York Street. He painted miniatures and oil portraits. John Camillus Hone died at his house in Summerhill, Dublin, on 23 May 1836.<br>
<br>Nathaniel Hone also painted his daughters Lydia (<i>bap</i>. 1756) and Amelia, his granddaughter Eleanor (or Mary) Metcalfe, his brother Samuel, and his mother. He is believed to have had at least seven other children, Samuel Augustus (<i>bap</i>. 1748), Herbert, Apelles Earl (<i>bap</i>. 1750), Mary, Charles, Sophie, and Floretta Augusta (<i>bap</i>. 1751). Hone was also a competent etcher and an enthusiastic art collector, and could count within his collection drawings by and prints after works by such artists as Maratti, Rubens, Rembrandt, Watteau, and Vernet, and a large number after Hogarth. A number of his drawings and prints carry his mark, a human eye. His collection was sold in two auctions in February and March 1785. Hone was also associated, with Captain William Baillie, in the formation of Lord Bute's collection.<br>
<br>Hone moved to Pall Mall in 1774, and then to north Soho in 1780. He may have maintained contact with his family in Dublin, but remained in London until his death at his home, 44 Rathbone Place, on 14 August 1784. He was buried six days later on 20 August in Hendon churchyard, where five of his children had already been interred. In his will Hone mentions that his &#145;dear wife Ann Hone's fortune is in her own power&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1121, sig. 509). This suggests that Ann was probably identical with the Mary Earle whom Hone married in 1742. Hone's portraiture was solid, and sometimes exceptional. He was particularly adept at depicting children, and often afforded his sitters a distinctly soft expression. Though he was not universally admired, and his use of colour was often adversely criticized, he commanded an enviable profile among his peers.<br>
