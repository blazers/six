<span class="headword">Carton,  Claude</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Richard Claude Critchett]</span>  (1856&#150;1928), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born at 46 Finsbury Square, London, on 10 May 1856. He was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6711/', "George Critchett (1817&#150;1882)")</script>, ophthalmic surgeon, and his wife, Martha Wilson, daughter of Captain Nathanael Brooker RN, of Bosham, Sussex; his brother was Sir George Anderson Critchett (1845&#150;1925), also an eye specialist. In 1875, adopting the surname Carton, he took to the stage at Bristol (29 March) in T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">Sea of Ice</span>, and made his London d&eacute;but (19 June) as Osric in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> at Henry Irving's Lyceum Theatre, where he later created Courtenay in Tennyson's <span class="italic">Queen Mary</span> (1876). His early career, interspersed with several out-of-town engagements (especially Liverpool), involved in the autumn of 1876 a provincial tour with Irving, in whose acting company Carton began his lifelong friendship with Arthur Wing Pinero. At the Folly Theatre, London, which he managed briefly, Carton produced and performed in Pinero's early comedy <span class="italic">Imprudence</span> (1881), winning qualified approval for his &#145;cynical, cool&#146;, but &#145;crude&#146; style  (Pascoe, 43) as the adventurer Baines Durant.<br>
<br>Carton never really liked acting: his unremarkable career ended when the success of the boulevard-type farce <span class="italic">The Great Pink Pearl</span> (1885), the first of three collaborations with Cecil Raleigh, established him as a professional playwright. His first solo drama, the sentimental comedy <span class="italic">Sunlight and Shadow</span> (1890), starred George Alexander and Marion Terry. <span class="italic">Liberty Hall</span> (1892) was written during a period of severe ill health and uneasily slotted between <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> and <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span> at the St James's Theatre. It was Carton's first major artistic and financial success, running to 182 performances. Set mainly in a Bloomsbury bookshop, it combines sentiment with humour in the manner of the early Dickens, Carton's professed model.<br>
<br>Carton's writing, especially from the late 1890s onwards, was largely shaped by the comic acting strengths of his wife, Katherine Julia Mackenzie (1853&#150;1928)&#151;stage name Miss Compton&#151;the younger daughter of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6033/', "Henry Compton (1805&#150;1877)")</script>. She and Carton acted together in the late 1870s and the early 1880s, in plays that included some early ones by Pinero. In 1885 she appeared in her husband's first play as a haughty Russian countess, foreshadowing the <i>grande dame</i> character which, in middle age, became her speciality in such notably successful roles as Lady Algernon Chetland in <span class="italic">Lord and Lady Algy</span> (1898)&#151;with Charles Hawtrey as hero&#151;and Joanna, duchess of Rushmere, in <span class="italic">Mr Preedy and the Countess</span> (1909). Carton's writing was perfectly attuned to her &#145;deep-toned drawl&#146;, &#145;deceptively vacant smile&#146;, &#145;stately deliberation&#146;, and &#145;consummate knowledge of how to make the points&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 May 1928).<br>
<br>After Pinero, Henry Arthur Jones, and Sydney Grundy, Carton was the most performed playwright of the 1890s. Shaw remarked that Carton's plays might lack originality but were &#145;so extremely goodnatured that they disarm criticism&#146;  (Shaw, 3.232). Carton had some gift for humour and for witty, if occasionally overly metaphoric, dialogue. His success continued with sometimes morally tendentious society comedies, often bordering on farce, such as <span class="italic">Lady Huntworth's Experiment</span> (1900), <span class="italic">The Rich Mrs Repton</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Mr Hopkinson</span> (1905), <span class="italic">Eccentric Lord Comberdene</span> (1910), and <span class="italic">The Bear Leaders</span> (1912). Carton's last substantial success (in collaboration with Justin McCarthy) was <span class="italic">Nurse Benson</span> (1918), a topical wartime farce, featuring Marie L&ouml;hr as a nurse in love with a wounded patient. Carton's work has not been printed or reprinted since 1925. <span class="italic">Liberty Hall</span> was last revived in London, briefly, in 1930.<br>
<br>A bookish and to some extent retiring&#151;even reclusive&#151;individual, Carton never attended his first nights; yet he insisted on conducting his own rehearsals, believing that authors were best fitted to help actors to develop their parts. Although he had no time for the bohemian side of the theatre, he actively promoted fellow playwrights' professional interests as founder member in 1909 of the dramatic subcommittee of the Society of Authors, and of the Dramatists' Club. Carton died at his home, Red Lodge, Springfield Park, Acton, Middlesex, on 1 April 1928; his wife died at the same address the following month. Both were buried in Acton cemetery. They had one daughter, named Lenore.<br>
