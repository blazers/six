<span class="headword">Bullock,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1342/3), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, is of unknown origins, and his early career is equally obscure. He is simply described in the sources as <i>capellanus</i> or <i>presbyterus</i> (&#145;chaplain&#146; or &#145;priest&#146;), but his abilities seem to have been administrative and military. He first appears, probably at the end of 1333, as chamberlain to Edward Balliol, claimant to the Scottish throne. At this point Balliol, with English support, was trying to set up the basis of an administration, in which the chamberlain was, in Scottish practice, the principal financial official. Bullock, however, was also given charge of the royal castle of Cupar in Fife&#151;as keeper he received wages from the English exchequer at latest from early 1336&#151;and custody of the castle of St Andrews, which belonged to the bishopric, then vacant. In 1337 he successfully defended Cupar Castle against Sir Andrew Murray, the guardian for the young David II, though Murray was able to recover St Andrews Castle.<br>
<br>Scottish resistance to Balliol was growing and by 1339 his prospects must have looked slim. Probably in the summer of that year Bullock was approached by William Douglas, later known as Douglas of Liddesdale, who had come back from France to strengthen the siege of Perth, one of the few places remaining in the hands of an English or pro-English garrison. Douglas persuaded Bullock to transfer his allegiance and Cupar Castle to David II, in return, it is said, for &#145;a large reward in lands and possessions&#146;  (Bower, 7.141). From then on Bullock seems to have been an adherent of this William Douglas. The English government apparently did not discover Bullock's desertion for some time, since an advance payment on his wages for the next year was still being recorded in December 1339. At the siege of Perth he is said to have &#145;offered useful advice and brought appropriate help to the besiegers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Johannis de Fordun Chronica</span>, 364), particularly in suggesting moving their protective shelters closer to the walls to cover them from attack by crossbowmen. In 1341 he is credited with assisting in the cunningly executed seizure of Edinburgh Castle.<br>
<br>Bullock appears as chamberlain to David II from 22 May 1341, just before the king's return from France. His predecessor's account, covering the period 1334&#150;8, showed an accumulated deficit of almost &pound;2600. Bullock's first account, which he presented in 1342, struck an exact balance, after a number of complex allowances. This was mainly the result of a resumption of regular and efficient government, which points to Bullock's ability as a civil servant. He was clearly expert in balancing accounts. The fourteenth-century chronicler John Fordun describes him as &#145;outstanding among his contemporaries in prudence and in eloquence in his native tongue &hellip; and famous for his experienced and penetrating counsel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Johannis de Fordun Chronica</span>, 364). But however much the turncoat's skill and advice were used, he was evidently not trusted. His wealth was envied, and apparently about the summer of 1342 he was accused of treason, though no details of the charges or names of the accusers are known. It is possible that his downfall was caused by a struggle for border lordship and engineered in retaliation for William Douglas's recent killing of Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie. Bullock was arrested and imprisoned in a place called &#145;Malimoram&#146;, believed to be Mamore in Lochaber; he died &#145;of hunger and cold&#146; soon after  (Bower, 7.157).<br>
