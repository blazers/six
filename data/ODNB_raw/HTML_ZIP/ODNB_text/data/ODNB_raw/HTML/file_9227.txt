<span class="headword">Fawcett <span class="st"> [Faucitt]</span>, Sir  William</span>  (1727&#150;1804), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, was born into an old gentry family on 30 April 1727 at Shibden Hall, Halifax, Yorkshire, the son of William Faucitt (1706&#150;1729?) of Bull Close, Halifax, and his wife, Martha (1704&#150;1789), the daughter of James Lister of Shibden Hall. His father died when Fawcett was an infant, and the boy's education was superintended by his clergyman uncle, the Revd John Lister (1703&#150;1759), at the free school at Bury, Lancashire. In his youth he became fluent in German and French. He may have taken part as a volunteer with Oglethorpe's Yorkshiremen in the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1745. With the recommendation of his neighbours Lord Rockingham and Edward Lascelles (later earl of Harewood), he joined the army as a volunteer in the Low Countries, where on 11 October 1748 he was commissioned to a death vacancy as ensign in the 33rd foot. The post-war reductions, coming immediately afterwards, put him on half pay; he was commissioned ensign once again on 19 June 1749, in the 38th foot; but marriage intervened, and he exchanged onto half pay two months later. It was on 26 January 1751 that he began his uninterrupted career, exchanging to become an ensign in the 3rd foot guards, with which regiment he was to remain for nearly twenty-eight years.<br>
<br>Early in August 1749 Fawcett married Susanna (1729&#150;1783), the daughter of John Brooke of Hampstead, who brought him &pound;80 per annum, the interest on what Fawcett described as &#145;her Fortune which amounts to &pound;2,000, payable at her age of 21&#146;  (Central Library, Halifax, SH:7/FAW). They had eight children between 1750 and 1761, three of whom&#151;William, (<i>b</i>. 1750); Walker Dawson, (<i>b</i>. 1754); and Oswald, (<i>b</i>. 1761)&#151;were commissioned in the army; William and Walker Dawson reached general rank.<br>
<br>Fawcett's devotion to his profession and to the good of the service, which was to continue throughout his life, was apparent from 1754, when he published his first work, a translation of the current <span class="italic">Regulations for the Prussian Infantry</span>. This was followed in 1757 by the first English translation of <span class="italic">Reveries, or, Memoirs upon the Art of War</span>, by Maurice, comte de Saxe. On 14 May 1757 Fawcett purchased a lieutenancy in the 3rd guards (with rank in the army as captain, in the double-rank system prevailing in the guards); and from 1 December 1757 until 21 August 1765 he served in addition as that corps' adjutant, again indicative of application to duty. In 1759 he prepared an updated revision (the &#145;8th edition&#146;) of General Humphrey Bland's <span class="italic">Treatise of Military Discipline</span>, and the same year published another translation, <span class="italic">Regulations for the Prussian Cavalry</span>. These were all works highly regarded in professional circles, and all were later reprinted.<br>
<br>Fawcett went to the war in Germany in 1758 with the first British contingent, as aide-de-camp to the respected General Granville Elliot, and after Elliot died in 1759 was aide-de-camp to the marquess of Granby, who commanded all the British troops in Ferdinand of Brunswick's army from August 1759. Fawcett was sufficiently regarded by Granby as to be sent home with the news of the 31 July 1760 victory of Warburg, &#145;giving the whole account in German&#146; to the king  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 74, 1804, 385), for which he was rewarded with a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy dated 25 November 1760; he then returned to Germany, and served there for the remainder of the war as the field army's deputy adjutant-general and Granby's military secretary.<br>
<br>During his friend Granby's <i>de facto</i> command of the army, from 1766, Fawcett was made deputy adjutant-general, and on 24 February 1767 he purchased the 3rd guards' captain-lieutenancy, succeeding on 3 July 1767 to the captaincy of his own company. In 1770 he obtained the sinecure lieutenant-governorship of Pendennis Castle, and on 25 May 1772 he was made brevet colonel. Fawcett travelled frequently, during his career, to observe the training and drill of the armies of Europe, and was several times in attendance at the Prussian army's annual manoeuvres. In 1775 he was sent to Hanover to arrange for electoral troops to reinforce the Gibraltar and Minorca garrisons; in 1775&#150;6 he negotiated the subsidy treaties and engaged Hesse-Cassel, Hesse-Hanau, and Brunswick auxiliaries to prosecute the war in America; and during the years following he made frequent trips to Germany to inspect and muster replacements, for which services he was rewarded with the sinecure governorship of Gravesend and Tilbury Fort. Fawcett's son William, of the 3rd guards, was to act as aide-de-camp to the Hessian contingent commanders in America, Heister and Knyphausen. Fawcett was promoted major-general on 29 August 1777, and was given the colonelcy of the 15th foot on 12 November 1778.<br>
<br>In 1781, already one of the most knowledgeable and professional soldiers and tacticians of the age, Fawcett was appointed adjutant-general on the British establishment, and, on being promoted lieutenant-general on 20 November 1782, entered upon the most important phase of his career. During the 1780s and 1790s he frequently encouraged studious officers, even sending out several times, as adjutant-general, army-wide circulars successfully soliciting subscriptions to new professional publications. He was responsible for stabilizing in 1786&#150;7 the army's badly disrupted (by the late war) system of training and drill, then, during the years 1788&#150;92 and beyond, acted as one of the principal figures (in conjunction with the duke of York, generals David Dundas, Sir William Pitt, and the earl of Pembroke, Major Le Marchant, and several other leading officers) in the preparation, testing, and issue of the regulations laid down for the heavy infantry. He achieved the same for the cavalry during 1787 and between 1794 and 1796. His last translation, of Francis de Rottenburg's German drillbook, as <span class="italic">Regulations for the Exercise of Riflemen and Light Infantry</span>, was issued in 1798 as the official drill for the new light infantry. All of these regulations were outstanding works and were crucial in preparing the army for the great struggle against revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Fawcett was at the same time one of the senior officers instrumental in the planning that led to the founding of the Royal Military College, at High Wycombe and then at Marlow.<br>
<br>Fawcett's wife, Susanna, died at Eversley, Hampshire, on 7 April 1783, and the same year he married Charlotte Lucy (1751&#150;1805), the widow of the chancellor of Lincoln, Dr George Stinton, and the daughter of Mr Noble of Louth, Lincolnshire. There were no children from this marriage. Fawcett was made a knight of the Bath in 1786; was appointed colonel of the 3rd dragoon guards on 22 August 1792; and was promoted full general on 14 May 1796. That same year he became governor of Chelsea Hospital. He retired in 1799 as a result of his age and failing eyesight, but was sworn a member of the privy council on 23 January. When he died, of old age, at his house in Great George Street, Westminster, on 22 March 1804, his funeral cort&egrave;ge included, among others, the prince of Wales and the royal dukes of Clarence, Kent, York, and Cambridge, together with &#145;a great number of General officers&#146;; eight generals acted as his pallbearers  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 74, 1804, 385). He was buried on 31 March in the chapel of Chelsea Hospital, where a monument was erected to him by his widow; she was buried beside him in 1805. The historian R. Glover justly called him &#145;a grand old soldier&#146;  (Glover, 43).<br>
