<span class="headword">Watts,  Hugh</span>  (1582/3&#150;1643), <span class="occ">bell-founder</span>, was born at Leicester, the second son of Francis Watts (<i>d</i>. 1600), bell-founder, and his wife, Mary. His grandfather may have been the Hew Wat who in 1563 cast a bell for South Luffenham, Rutland. In 1600 Watts cast for Evington in Leicestershire a bell bearing for the first time his own name as founder, with the device of three bells that his father had employed. The same device had been borne by Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire bells made by a William Watts, and in 1450 by Richard Brayser of Norwich, to whom the first member of the Watts family to enter the trade may have been apprenticed.<br>
<br>In 1611 Watts was admitted to the chapmans' or merchants' guild; and he probably married soon afterwards. His wife, Mary, sons Hugh (1611&#150;1656) and Francis, and daughters Frances and Ellen survived him. In 1620&#150;21 Watts was elected chamberlain of the borough, and in 1633&#150;4 he became mayor of Leicester, for which he received the customary allowance of &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. During his mayoralty Charles I and his queen passed through Leicester, their reception costing the city over &pound;200. Watts accumulated considerable wealth and he lent generously to the corporation of Leicester in times of difficulty, &pound;400 being repaid to him in the period 1637&#150;9. He contributed again when Prince Rupert called on Leicester for money in 1641&#150;2.<br>
<br>Watts's younger son, Francis, was made free in the chapmans' guild in 1636. The Revd Philip Hackett recounted how Francis had asked his father to go to London to hear the best tenor bell, and while Hugh was there Francis wrote instructing him to return at a given hour on a set day. Francis meanwhile succeeded in casting, at the second attempt, a very fine bell, which was then hung. As his father drew within earshot of Leicester the sound of the purity and tone of this bell gladdened his heart  (Nichols, 358).<br>
<br>In 1876, when T. North was writing, nearly 200 of Watts's bells remained in Leicestershire, including several complete rings that were admired for the beauty of their tone&#151;the peal of ten bells for St Margaret's, Leicester, was said to be the finest in England  (North). Many of the bells bore inscriptions&#151;Watts's favourite being &#145;J.H.S.: Nazareus: rex: Iudeorum: Fili: Dei: miserere: Mei&#146;&#151;these came to be known as Watts's Nazarenes. He worked his foundry until his death in Leicester, aged sixty, in February or March 1643; he was buried in St Mary's Church, Leicester. His son Hugh inherited his bell-metal and tools, and he married Jane, daughter of Sir Thomas Burton, bt of Stockerston, Leicestershire. However, soon after 1643 the business was wound up and partly taken over by Nottingham founders.<br>
