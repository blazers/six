<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butler,  Richard Austen <span class="st"> [Rab]</span></span>, Baron Butler of Saffron Walden  (1902&#150;1982), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Attock Serai, Punjab, India, on 9 December 1902, the eldest of a family of two sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32215/', "Sir Montagu Sherard Dawes Butler (1873&#150;1952)")</script> and his wife, Anne Gertrude Smith (1876&#150;1954). His father, who had passed top into the Indian Civil Service, was a member of a remarkable academic dynasty (since 1794) of Cambridge dons, which included a master of Trinity, two headmasters of Harrow, and one of Haileybury. He later became governor of the Central Provinces and, finally, of the Isle of Man. His mother, warm, sympathetic, and encouraging, and to whom Butler was always devoted, was one of ten talented children of George Smith CIE, a Scottish teacher, journalist, and editor in India. She was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36139/', "Sir George Adam Smith")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandentryintopolitics"></a>Education, marriage, and entry into politics</h2>When Butler was six he fell from his pony and broke his right arm in three places, an injury which was aggravated by a hot-water bottle burn. The arm never fully recovered, and successful games playing was thus ruled out, though he became a keen shot. Returning to be educated in England, Butler attended the Wick preparatory school at Hove. Having rebelled against going to Harrow School because of a surfeit of Butlers there and having failed a scholarship for Eton College, Butler (by now known as Rab as his father had intended) went to Marlborough College. After a final year learning modern languages, which were better taught than the classics he had earlier endured, Butler went to France to improve his French with the diplomatic service in mind. He won an exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge&#151;the money was needed&#151;which, after a first class in the modern and medieval languages tripos (1923), was converted into a scholarship. He became secretary of the union as a Conservative. An unsuccessful love affair and a mainly nervous collapse did not stop him becoming president of the union (1924). In his fourth year Butler gained a first in history (1925) and a fellowship at Corpus Christi College.<br>
<br>While an undergraduate Butler had met Sydney Elizabeth Courtauld (1902&#150;1954), a capable, strong-minded girl, who became his wife on 20 April 1926. Her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32587/', "Samuel Courtauld")</script>, an industrialist, settled &pound;5000 a year on Butler for life tax-free. This financial independence enabled him to decide on a parliamentary career, though his father told him that strong personal executive decisions were not his forte and he should aim for the speakership. While the honeymooners went round the world, the Courtauld family secured for them a fairly safe seat, Saffron Walden in Essex, and on their return Butler was duly selected without the complication of competing candidates. He had a comfortable victory in the general election of 1929 and held the seat until his retirement in 1965. Before the election he had become private secretary to Sir Samuel Hoare, and he soon became known to the party hierarchy. His first notable public act was a sharp exchange in <span class="italic">The Times</span> with Harold Macmillan, who was advised to seek &#145;a pastime more suited for his talents&#146; than politics (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 May 1930; Howard, 41).<h2>
<a name="Ajuniorminister"></a>A junior minister</h2>In the National Government in 1931 Hoare became India secretary and Butler his parliamentary private secretary. At the second round-table conference Butler was deeply impressed by M. K. Gandhi, the current hate figure of many Conservatives and of his father. After a tour of India, Butler became Hoare's under-secretary in September 1932. His support of constitutional reform and knowledge of the Indian scene made him a natural choice, even though he had been in parliament only three and a half years and was easily the youngest member of the government. India was the issue on which Winston Churchill was challenging Stanley Baldwin, and in the Commons Butler compared himself to &#145;the miserable animal&#146;, a bait &#145;in the form of a bullock calf tied to a tree, awaiting the arrival of the lord of the forest&#146; (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, vol. 276, col. 1011, 29 March 1933; Howard, 376). Yet he was never devoured by Churchill and proved himself Hoare's able lieutenant in defending the <span class="roman">India Bill</span> throughout the fierce two and a half year war waged against it by the Conservative right wing.<br>
<br>The Butlers had since 1928 lived in the constituency, first at Broxted and then at Stansted Hall, Halstead, where their three sons and a daughter were largely brought up, and where in 1935 Baldwin came for the weekend and Churchill was invited&#151;something which the new prime minister remembered in 1940. They also had a flat in Wood Street, London, until they moved to 3 Smith Square in 1938. They entertained generously in both London and the country.<h2>
<a name="ForeignOfficeappeasement"></a>Foreign Office: appeasement</h2>Neville Chamberlain's accession to the premiership in May 1937 brought Butler a welcome release from the India Office but not a department of his own. Nevertheless, his stint as parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Labour gave him a useful acquaintance with the depressed areas and with mass unemployment. After nine months he went to the Foreign Office as under-secretary of state in February 1938. With the foreign secretary, the first earl of Halifax, in the House of Lords he was once again prominent&#151;in the long run, indeed, too prominent. The policy of appeasement cut across the Conservative Party much more deeply than India or unemployment, and, when Churchill took over, Butler was on the wrong side of the divide. Appeasement was held against him in a way it was not against those more minor supporters of the Munich agreement, Lord Dunglass (Alec Douglas-Home) and Quintin Hogg.<br>
<br>Butler was an enthusiastic Chamberlainite and like Chamberlain regarded Munich not as a means of buying time but as a way of settling differences with Adolf Hitler. Winding up for the government in the House of Commons on the day that Churchill had earlier delivered a powerful polemic against the Munich agreement, Butler maintained that Britain had &#145;two choices&#151;either to settle our differences with Germany by consultation, or to face the inevitability of a clash between the two systems of democracy and dictatorship&#146;, unwisely adding that war settled nothing  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, vol. 339, col. 453, 5 Oct 1938). He was disposed, however, to interpret Benito Mussolini's invasion of Albania as a general threat to the Balkans, until Chamberlain told him not to be silly and to go home to bed. Butler remained an appeaser down to the outbreak of war. He did not favour an alliance with Russia, and he opposed the Polish alliance signed on 25 August 1939 because it would have &#145;a bad psychological effect on Hitler&#146;  (Howard, 85). Indeed even after Britain had declared war Butler remained something of an appeaser. After Chamberlain's fall he, together with Alec Dunglass and two friends, drank to the &#145;King over the Water&#146; and described Churchill as the greatest political adventurer of modern political history  (Colville, 122).<br>
<br>Despite his conspicuous identification with the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, Butler survived Churchill's reconstruction of the government in May 1940. &#145;I wish you to go on&#146;, Churchill told him, &#145;with your delicate manner of answering parliamentary questions without giving anything away&#146;; the prime minister also expressed appreciation of having been asked to &#145;Butler's private residence&#146;. The Foreign Office was now a backwater, whose calm was only disturbed by Butler's imprudent conversation with Dr Bjorn Prytz, the Swedish minister in London in June 1940. &#145;Britain's official attitude&#146;, Prytz telegraphed Stockholm after his interview, &#145;will for the present continue to be that the war must go on, but [Butler] assured me that no opportunity for reaching a compromise would be neglected if the possibility were offered on reasonable conditions&#146;. When Prytz's telegram came to the prime minister's notice, he complained to Halifax that Butler's &#145;odd language&#146; indicated a lukewarm attitude to the war if not defeatism. Even so, Churchill magnanimously accepted Butler's highly unconvincing explanation of the damaging incident  (Roberts, 232&#150;4). Butler was lucky to keep his job. Bombed out of both Smith Square and his father-in-law's house, Butler went for a time to stay in Belgrave Square with Henry (Chips) Channon, his parliamentary private secretary since 1938.<h2>
<a name="Educationandpostwarreconstruction"></a>Education and post-war reconstruction</h2>Butler remained at the Foreign Office against his wishes when Sir Anthony Eden, whom he did not admire, succeeded Halifax in December 1940. But in July 1941 after nine years as an under-secretary he became president of the Board of Education. Even further removed from the war than the Foreign Office, education was nevertheless a political minefield and had seen no major reform since 1902. Ignoring Churchill's warnings not to stir up either party politics or religious controversy, Butler decided on comprehensive reform. Although in the end he had to exclude the public schools, every child was given the right to free secondary education and, to make that right a reality for the poor, provision was made for the expansion of both nursery and further education and for the raising of the school-leaving age. All Butler's formidable diplomatic and political skills were needed to secure the agreement of the churches as well as the acquiescence of Churchill and Conservative back-benchers, whom Butler thought &#145;a stupid lot&#146;. The 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, which Butler believed would &#145;have the effect of welding us into one nation&#151;instead of two nations as Disraeli talked about&#146;  (Timmins, 92, 95), was Butler's greatest legislative achievement and was deservedly called after him.<br>
<br>Butler became chairman of the Conservative Party's post-war problems central committee in 1941, and in November 1943 he joined the government's reconstruction committee. The only leading Conservative clear-sighted enough to oppose an early election, he became minister of labour in Churchill's &#145;caretaker&#146; government in May 1945. After the electoral defeat in July&#151;Butler's own majority fell to 1158&#151;Churchill made him chairman of the Conservative Research Department, although his own bizarre preference was for Duncan Sandys. At that time there was little to be chairman of, but with the considerable assistance of David Clarke, and later, Michael Fraser, whom Butler rightly described as &#145;the best adjutant the party has ever had&#146;, the department was up to strength by the end of 1946  (R. A. Butler, 140). Like Churchill, who thought it would tie the hands of the next Conservative government and cripple the party now, Butler was chary of embarking upon detailed policy-making, though for different reasons. He thought the time was not yet ripe for it, wanting to make sure that the party was facing in the right direction before it made firm commitments. In 1946 Butler also became chairman of the industrial policy committee, whose members included three future chancellors of the exchequer as well as Oliver Stanley and three other future cabinet ministers.<br>
<br>From these two positions Butler exerted the major influence in reshaping Conservative policy and producing the civilized Conservatism of the post-war party. In 1947 the industrial policy committee produced the <span class="italic">Industrial Charter</span>, which, Butler told Lord Woolton in 1949, &#145;placed the party on the fairway of modern economic and political thought&#146;  (Ramsden, <span class="italic">Age of Churchill</span>, 134). His later more detailed verdict was that &#145;the <span class="italic">Charter</span> was &hellip; an assurance, that in the interests of efficiency, full employment, and social security, modern Conservatism would maintain strong central guidance over the operation of the economy&#146;. Mass unemployment was to be a thing of the past; as Butler put it, those who advocated &#145;creating pools of unemployment should be thrown into them and made to swim&#146;  (R. A. Butler, 146, 61). The right wing regarded Butler's efforts as &#145;pink socialism&#146;, a recurring charge under various names in his later career. He himself believed that, without the rejection of unemployment and the acceptance of the welfare state, the spectre of the thirties would not be exorcized and the Conservative Party would remain in opposition. Accordingly Butler was happy in 1950 to welcome &#145;as a healthy piece of constructive work&#146; <span class="italic">One Nation</span>, the first pamphlet of a group of nine new tory MPs, among whom were Iain Macleod, Angus Maude, Edward Heath, and Enoch Powell. The pamphlet described full employment as &#145;a first responsibility of government&#146;, and called on the Conservative Party &#145;to act as a balancing force, to ensure that liberty and order reinforce one another&#146;.<br>
<br>Since Marlborough, painting had been Butler's chief hobby; after the war he occasionally painted with Churchill, once being commanded by him to &#145;take the mountains&#146;, while his leader would &#145;take the sea&#146;  (R. A. Butler, 33). Butler thought their paintings were of about the same standard.<h2>
<a name="Chancelloroftheexchequer"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer</h2>Contrary to the general expectation and his own, Butler became chancellor of the exchequer in October 1951 and inherited the usual economic crisis. He tackled it by import controls and the resurrection of monetary policy. Butler himself favoured more drastic measures, having accepted a plan cooked up in the Bank of England and the Treasury. Under this plan, known as Robot, the pound was to be allowed to float (or rather sink); it was to be made (partially) convertible into dollars; and most of the sterling balances held in London were to be blocked. While Robot's first two provisions seem reasonable in retrospect, they would not have worked in 1952. As the British economy was then overloaded because of the excessive rearmament programme bequeathed by the Labour government, devaluation was inappropriate. Exports would scarcely have increased and imports would have been made more expensive. Britain's trading position would have been made still worse by the proposed very limited convertibility. Even the Treasury admitted that much of Britain's export trade might be faced with conditions of great difficulty. The third element of Robot was scarcely less damaging. Although Australia and other members of the sterling area were to be allowed to convert 10 per cent of their reserves into dollars, they would hardly take kindly to 90 per cent of their reserves being frozen. Apart from its effect on Britain, the plan broke the rules of the International Monetary Fund from which the government proposed to borrow money, would probably have killed the newly formed European Payments Union from which it had also just borrowed on a large scale, would have broken up much of the sterling area, and would have infuriated the west Europeans, the Commonwealth, and the United States. Nevertheless, had it not been for the opposition of Lord Cherwell and his chief economist, Donald MacDougall, Robot would have been accepted. Fortunately, after Cherwell had put to Churchill a paper, drafted by MacDougall, pointing out that Robot would produce a sharp rise in food prices and unemployment, the plan was defeated in cabinet.<br>
<br>Butler's wholehearted embrace of Robot, even though, as he admitted to his colleagues, his economic advisers were violently opposed to it, was markedly out of character. An innately cautious and prudent politician, he had spent much of the six years in opposition repudiating the kind of economics and the kind of Conservatism that Robot embodied and implied. To adopt his own earlier metaphor, Robot would have put the Conservative Party back &#145;in the rough&#146;. It would have been disastrous politically and economically, undoing at a stroke all Butler's efforts and achievements of the last six years. Not surprisingly, therefore, despite what he said in his memoirs, Butler later admitted that his opponents had been right all along  (Cairncross, 270). The next few months showed that not only had Robot prescribed the wrong remedies for the putative crisis but there had never been a crisis. As was becoming customary, the Treasury's assumptions and estimates all turned out to be mistaken. Not long after a cautious budget in March, when Butler raised the bank rate to 4 per cent and cut food subsidies by 40 per cent, but also cut income tax and increased pensions and welfare benefits to help the worst off, the reserves began to increase not drain away.<br>
<br>By September such was Butler's standing that in the absence of both Churchill and Eden he was left in charge of the government. Later in the autumn he was able to tell the lord mayor's banquet that the country had gained an invaluable breathing space; and he was the star of the tory party conference at Scarborough. By the end of the year the reserves were much higher than anybody in the Treasury had thought possible. By 1953 Butler had more scope to promote expansion and in his second budget was able to cut income tax and purchase tax and to promise the abolition of the excess profits levy. In the summer when, with Eden ill in Boston, Churchill was felled by a stroke, Butler again took charge of the government. The gravity of Churchill's illness, concealed by his entourage, was known to Butler; this was perhaps the first occasion on which he could have become prime minister had he striven for the job. He had no such thoughts and ran the government well.<br>
<br>After Robot's demise Butler &#145;reverted&#146;, as he said, &#145;to normal Keynesian economics&#146;  (Seldon, 559), and initially his policy differed little from Labour's. This led <span class="italic">The Economist</span> to introduce &#145;Mr Butskell &hellip; a composite of the present Chancellor and the previous one&#146; who spoke up for the course of moderation from both sides of the house. Butler had long been regarded by the Conservative right as being little better than a socialist, while the Labour left tended to regard Gaitskell as rather worse than a Conservative. Certainly both Gaitskell and Butler favoured Keynesian techniques and sought to maintain full employment. Both were moderates and both had good political manners. Both, too, had considerable respect for each other, but Gaitskell had (in Butler's words) &#145;unquenchably socialist&#146; convictions and a strong belief in equality; Butler had no such convictions or beliefs  (R. A. Butler, 160). Moreover, he had in contrast to Gaitskell a belief in monetary policy and much less interest in planning. Butler favoured convertibility; Gaitskell defended exchange controls and the sterling area. They differed, too, on the far greater emphasis that Gaitskell (rightly) gave to the need for Britain to invest more and consume less.<br>
<br>At the Treasury, Butler, who was one of the two best post-war chancellors, had two special difficulties. Sir Walter Monckton had been made minister of labour by Churchill to conciliate the unions, and conciliation entailed conceding excessive wage claims, sometimes in concert with the prime minister and without consulting the chancellor. &#145;Walter and I&#146;, Churchill told Butler one morning in 1954, &#145;settled the rail strike in the early hours of the morning on their terms. We did not think it necessary to keep you up&#146;  (R. A. Butler, 164). In any case, the government had no alternative but to rely on what Butler in his 1954 budget speech called &#145;voluntary moderation&#146;. That policy had in fact worked well in 1952 and 1953 when rises in wages were small, but then it broke down, leaving what Butler later called &#145;a gaping hole in our armour&#146;  (ibid.). Butler's second special difficulty was the Conservatives' pledge to build 300,000 houses a year, which Macmillan, the minister of housing, never allowed the chancellor or the cabinet to forget. In consequence, too many of the nation's resources went into the housing drive. In 1954 Butler's third budget was, as he said, a &#145;carry-on affair&#146; with few changes, but later in the year he predicted the doubling of the country's standard of living within twenty-five years.<h2>
<a name="Importantmistakes"></a>Important mistakes</h2>On 9 December 1954 Butler's wife died after a long and painful illness. His grief and the loss of her influence as well as the effects of three gruelling years affected Butler's political judgement. His troubles were in any event growing: inflation and balance of payments difficulties necessitated a &#145;stop&#146;, and in February 1955 Butler raised the bank rate and brought back hire-purchase restrictions. Contrary to the later right-wing orthodoxy, Butler's fault was not to interfere too much but too little. Until 1955 industrial investment was inadequate, and virtually nothing was done to make particular industries more efficient. All the same, the record of the chancellor and of the government was one to be envied by all their successors. Apart from the mess they inherited from Labour, the Churchill administration avoided the sort of economic crises that plagued its predecessor and future governments. Butler loosened the economy without endangering social peace. The welfare state was protected and improved. By pursuing &#145;one nation&#146; centrism the government engineered a contented country.<br>
<br>The electorate's response in 1955 was to say it wanted more of the same. Butler produced for Eden an electioneering budget, taking 6<i>d</i>. off income tax. That was his first mistake. After the election Eden invited him to give up the Treasury, but Butler refused, which was his second mistake. Butler then had what he called &#145;a very disagreeable summer&#146;, being the target of criticism both from his own side and the opposition  (R. A. Butler, 179). Gaitskell accused him of having deliberately deceived the electorate, while his Treasury advisers slowly awoke to the growing danger of inflation which their bad budgetary advice had acutely exacerbated. After Butler had failed to persuade the cabinet of the need to cut the bread subsidies and take other drastic measures, a run on the pound compelled an autumn budget whose unimaginativeness underlined the errors of its predecessor&#151;Butler's third mistake. In December 1955 Eden decided to replace him with Macmillan, who showed by his stipulated terms for his transfer, to which the prime minister weakly submitted, that he was determined also to replace Butler as Eden's heir apparent. Disregarding the advice of Harry Crookshank, Macmillan's oldest friend, that he was committing &#145;sheer political suicide&#146;, Butler consented to become merely lord privy seal and leader of the house&#151;his fourth and biggest mistake  (Howard, 221). He needed a change, but ministerial power in British politics rests with the big departments and for Butler to allow himself to be left without a department was a gratuitous act of unilateral disarmament.<br>
<br>Macmillan later admitted that in the light of subsequent events his demands implied that he was &#145;actuated by some degree of personal rivalry with Butler&#146;  (Macmillan, 693). Though Macmillan was to the left of him on economics, there was no issue on which Butler was, in the eyes of the Conservative Party, seen to be right wing. Many Conservatives saw him as a &#145;Butskellite&#146;. Hence he was always more popular in the country than in his own party. His appearance was not charismatic, with his damaged arm, his sad, irregular features, and his clothes, described by Channon as &#145;truly tragic&#146;. But behind it there was a Rolls-Royce mind and a sharp sardonic wit which he enjoyed exerting at the expense of his colleagues. He was the master of many types of ambiguity&#151;&#145;there is no one's retirement party Mollie [his second wife] and I would like more to attend&#146;&#151;and occasionally the cause of ambiguity in others. In the autumn Eden's colleagues, his supporters, and the newspapers had become increasingly disenchanted with the prime minister; and his mishandled reshuffle, whose most conspicuous features were the moves of Butler and Macmillan, brought a renewed press bombardment. Butler watched the prime minister's travails with detachment; &#145;I have been very calm&#146;, he said. But, unlike Macmillan, he was indiscreet in public. Questioned at Heathrow airport about articles hostile to Eden in the Sunday papers, Butler expressed his &#145;determination to support the Prime Minister in all his difficulties&#146;. While Eden could have done without that sort of support, it was another of Butler's declarations which won the headlines: Eden, he said, is &#145;the best Prime Minister we have&#146;  (Howard, 222). No doubt the new lord privy seal was correct in saying that those words were not his but the reporter's; he had merely given his assent to them&#151;and a denial to the reporter would of course have been even worse. Yet they sounded like a typical &#145;Rabism&#146;, and had Butler felt more warmly to Eden he would probably have been more careful. Describing the episode in his autobiography, Butler said that Eden's reshuffle did not receive a favourable press, characteristically adding that &#145;a series of articles began to appear assessing [Eden's performance] in decidedly unflattering and somewhat unfair terms&#146; (Howard, 222; R. A. Butler, 183).<h2>
<a name="Suezandmissingno10"></a>Suez, and missing no. 10</h2>Butler was ill when President Nasser of Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company in 1956 and was in no danger of being infected by the collective hysteria that followed in Britain and France. He missed the first cabinet meeting at which the fatal route to Port Said was mapped and he was not included in the Egypt committee that Eden set up, though he occasionally attended it. His freedom from departmental responsibilities would for once have been an advantage, but cool, detached advice was not what Eden wanted. Over Suez Butler's predicament was acute. Far too intelligent to accept Eden's likening of Nasser to Mussolini, he had nevertheless an &#145;appeasing&#146; past to live down. Believing that party and public opinion required action of some sort, Butler also believed that Britain should act in accordance with international law.<br>
<br>Hence Butler was in a similar position to John Foster Dulles, the American secretary of state, and was driven to similar deviousness: as the international position altered, different expedients had to be produced to prevent Eden launching an attack on Egypt. But what was permissible in Dulles, trying to divert an ally from folly, looked less so in the cabinet's nominal number two seeking to restrain his leader, sick and unbalanced though Eden was. Butler would probably have done better to state his position unequivocally or to keep quiet or to resign; doubts were not enough. Even so, if he had succeeded, as his phrase went, in keeping Eden &#145;in a political strait-jacket&#146; he would have done the prime minister and the country a great service. But by October Butler had run out of strait-jackets, and he used the wrong tactics for defeating the Anglo-French-Israeli plan. Instead of joining with Monckton in direct opposition to a grubby conspiracy which was bound to fail, Butler implausibly advocated that Britain, France, and Israel should mount an open attack on Egypt which would have been scarcely less disastrous. After the UN had voted for an emergency force and an Israeli-Egyptian cease-fire seemed imminent, Butler tried to prevent the Anglo-French invasion as it was by then redundant; and when two days later Eden told the cabinet that a cease-fire was essential, Butler like Macmillan strongly supported him.<br>
<br>Butler's deviousness over Suez was honesty itself compared with the duplicity of Eden and some colleagues; and he was more consistent than Macmillan whose fire-eating bellicosity first drove Eden on towards destruction and who then suddenly demanded peace. Yet Butler's lack of enthusiasm for the use of force had offended the party's large pro-Suez element (many of whom disliked him anyway), and his failure to prevent it had disappointed the antis. He ended up pleasing virtually no one. By contrast, Macmillan, whose record on Suez was far worse&#151;he later admitted that it was &#145;a very bad episode&#146; in his life  (Horne, 1.447)&#151;had pleased the gunboat-minded by his initial fire-eating and then disarmed the opponents of force by his sudden switch to favouring a cease-fire. Unlike Butler, Macmillan was thought at least to know his own mind, even if he changed it. Butler had made matters still worse for himself by being, even by his standards, inordinately indiscreet. While in public he robustly defended Suez, he said very different things in private, being almost suicidally imprudent at a dinner of right-wing MPs. Butler's varying indiscretions to different back-bench groups gave the impression that he was not playing the game. Others were playing a deeper one.<br>
<br>Eden's retreat to the West Indies to recuperate left Butler to do the salvage work at the head of a weak and divided government. Inaccessible in Jamaica, Eden to his intense annoyance was largely ignored. &#145;I know&#146;, Butler condescendingly telegraphed to him, &#145;how difficult it must be for you to form a judgement on all that has gone on since you left&#146;  (Lamb, <span class="italic">Eden Government</span>, 297&#150;8). Eden, who probably thought it would have been easier to do so if he had been kept fully informed, can have been little more comforted to hear from Butler that there were &#145;many who would like to see you back, including members of the Cabinet&#146;  (Ramsden, <span class="italic">Winds of Change</span>, 320&#150;21). In Whitehall Butler was at his best, running the government as competently as he had done when Churchill was incapacitated. Yet as acting head of the government he was saddled with what he called &#145;the odious duty of withdrawing the troops&#146;  (R. A. Butler, 194). While Selwyn Lloyd thought that in Eden's absence he had been &#145;splendidly supported&#146; by Butler  (Lloyd, 252), Rab gained little credit for limiting the damage he had not caused. Instead, the salvage man was blamed for the wreckage.<h2>
<a name="Homesecretary"></a>Home secretary</h2>Butler did not mount a leadership campaign after Suez. Maybe he was too busy; maybe he thought it was unnecessary because he was bound to win; or, more probably, he thought Eden would be able to hold on until Easter or even the summer, so that a campaign would be premature. All the same, when Eden resigned on 9 January, Butler spent the evening pondering what he should say in his first broadcast to the nation as prime minister. In reality his chances had faded in the aftermath of Suez. The cabinet voted overwhelmingly for Macmillan, and back-bench soundings gave a similar result. Churchill preferred Butler personally but gave his backing to Macmillan, as did the chief whip, the chairman of the party, and the chairman of the 1922 committee. Eden gave no advice to the queen: he disliked both men but he preferred Butler. Butler took his defeat well. Macmillan refused him the Foreign Office, and Butler did not insist, accepting the Home Office while remaining leader of the house. At least he now had a department. He also, as under Churchill and Eden, had the government to run from time to time. When Macmillan in 1958 went on his Commonwealth tour after settling his &#145;little local difficulties&#146; over the resignation of his entire Treasury team in January, Butler was left, as he said, &#145;to hold the baby&#146;. As usual he held it well, and this time was popular. As home secretary he was a reformer, which was less popular.<br>
<br>After the October 1959 election Butler became chairman of the Conservative Party in addition to being home secretary and leader of the house. Other than demonstrating that there was almost no limit to his capacity for transacting public business at which he was indeed the unrivalled master, there was little point in Butler's new job. It was in any case scarcely compatible with his existing ones. His leadership of the house entailed trying to get on with the opposition in the Commons, while his chairmanship of the party entailed attacking the opposition in the country. Further, as home secretary, Butler was intent on penal reform, while many of his party faithful were intent on the return of flogging. However Butler was always adept at squaring circles, and he squared those three. Much more important to him than the acquisition of offices was his wedding, in the presence of the couple's ten children, on 21 October 1959 to Mollie (1907&#150;2009), a relative by marriage of his late wife, and widow of the polar explorer Augustine Courtauld; she was the daughter of Frank Douglas Montgomerie of Castle Hedingham, Essex. The marriage was strikingly happy and gave Butler renewed strength.<br>
<br>Butler was an outstanding home secretary, making few mistakes in handling a notoriously tricky department and initiating much useful legislation. He was stuck with the government's <span class="roman">Homicide Bill</span>, which introduced degrees of murder, since it was already on its way through parliament when he was appointed. The bill, which had been made necessary by the disagreement between Lords and Commons, was difficult to defend, but Butler deftly put it on the statute-book. While he was at the Home Office, he became a convinced abolitionist, though that did not cause him to err on the side of leniency, when considering whether or not to grant a reprieve. Even at the time, many thought his decision to allow the hanging of James Hanratty a serious misjudgement.<br>
<br>Elsewhere the prime minister allowed him &#145;a completely free hand&#146; with his reforms  (R. A. Butler, 197), a liberality probably assisted by Macmillan's awareness that they would make the home secretary a target of right-wing abuse. When home secretary, Winston Churchill had laid down that &#145;the mood and temper of the public with regard to the punishment of crimes and criminals is one of the unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country&#146;  (Howard, 255). Butler took Churchill's dictum as his text and, undeterred by signs that many on the right of his party would fail that test, he embarked on a comprehensive plan of penal reform. Pointing out that after examining all the available evidence the pre-war Cadogan committee had concluded that flogging was not a deterrent, Butler declined to reintroduce corporal punishment. His refusal annoyed the new MP for Finchley, Margaret Thatcher, who voted to bring back the birch or the cane for violent young offenders, the only time in her Commons career that she voted against the party line. It was then, as Butler wrote, that he had his main controversy with elements in the Conservative Party, &#145;Colonel Blimps of both sexes&#151;and the female of the species was more deadly, politically, than the male&#146;  (R. A. Butler, 200). The annual seaside outing of the hangers and floggers at the Conservative Party conference in full cry against the home secretary was not a spectacle for the squeamish, but at Brighton in 1961 Butler routed his opponents with a brilliant speech.<br>
<br>Much of the legislation for which the Home Office was responsible, Butler told a Conservative Party conference meeting in 1959, was still &#145;laced in Victorian corsetry&#146;  (R. A. Butler, 202). After the Wolfenden committee had recommended the effective removal of prostitutes from the streets and the legalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults in private, Butler found that the Colonel Blimps of the parliamentary party would allow him to enact only the first part of the committee's recommendations. Elsewhere, however, he could loosen the Victorian corsets without over-exciting the darker emotions of the Conservative right. The law on charities was reformed, and licensing hours and the law on obscene publications were both liberalized. In addition, by the introduction of betting shops, Butler's <span class="roman">Betting and Gaming Act</span> for the first time enabled the poorer classes to place a bet without breaking the law.<br>
<br>Butler's modernizing social legislation was broadly supported by the left wing of the party and by centrist and liberal opinion in the country; it was opposed or grudgingly endured by the Conservative right. On immigration Butler was supported by the right and opposed by those who were usually his allies. Churchill had favoured legislation to curb it, the Eden government had come close to introducing restrictions in 1955, and Macmillan had considered legislation in 1958. Between 1959 and 1961 the annual number of immigrants from the West Indies, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent grew from 21,000 to 136,000; so, although immigration had been scarcely an issue at the 1959 election, legislation had become inescapable by 1961. Even so, both Butler and Macleod, by then leader of the house, who together piloted the <span class="roman">Immigration Bill</span> through the Commons, found their task distasteful. The bill was bitterly attacked by the serious press and savaged by Gaitskell, who denounced Butler and Macleod as hypocrites for failing to stop it by threatening resignation. None the less Labour, a little later, abandoned its opposition to restricting immigration, and the Wilson government soon introduced controls which were stricter than Butler's.<br>
<br>In October 1961 Butler lost two of his offices, retaining only the Home Office, but after making what he later called &#145;a staunch decision to back the Common Market&#146; he was made overseer of the Common Market negotiations which in practice meant little  (Howard, 296). In March 1962 Macmillan, tired of the squabbling between the Colonial and Commonwealth offices, formed a new central Africa department and persuaded Butler to take charge of it. This was a real job, if a thankless one; characteristically, Butler merely added it to his other one. But in the cabinet massacre of July 1962 he lost the Home Office and was left with his central African responsibilities, with the honorific title of &#145;first secretary of state&#146; plus the intimation that he would be serving as deputy prime minister. Macmillan was thus able both to heap burdens onto the good-natured Butler and to strip him of them again almost at will. For nearly all his long parliamentary career Butler had been a minister: this gave him a unique experience of administration but made him too addicted to Whitehall ever to think of withdrawing. He had, too, the character and quality of a great public servant.<br>
<br>Macmillan weakened his government by banishing Butler from the home front. Yet the government gained in Africa. At the Victoria Falls conference in July 1963 Butler achieved the seemingly impossible feat of an orderly dissolution of the Central African Federation without conceding full independence to Southern Rhodesia.<h2>
<a name="Missingtheleadershipagain"></a>Missing the leadership again</h2>Butler made no attempt to take advantage of Macmillan's considerable troubles in the first half of 1963, and the prime minister's revived fortunes had persuaded him to fight the next election, when his prostate operation altered that decision. Butler was yet again asked to deputize. In January 1962 the prime minister had told Butler that if he went before the election &#145;all falls to you&#146;, but those words of reassurance were soon broken. In the summer of 1963 Macmillan told Hailsham that if he resigned before the election he wished Hailsham to be his successor, and when Hailsham asked about Rab, since he was surely the most obvious successor, Macmillan replied that &#145;Rab simply doesn't have it in him to be Prime Minister&#146; (Howard, 290; Walters, 111). Macmillan was determined to prevent Butler succeeding him and played an unprecedented part in choosing his own successor, at first supporting Hailsham and then switching to Home. At the Conservative Party conference at Blackpool, where the first round of the leadership struggle was fought, Butler ostentatiously and probably misguidedly kept himself aloof from all that was going on. But he successfully put forward his claim to make the leader's speech in place of Macmillan on the Saturday. The Homes and the Butlers lunched together before that final rally. Home told them that he was going to see his doctor for a medical examination the following week because he had been approached about being the party's leader. Both Rab and his wife were &#145;amazed&#146; by this intelligence, having thought like other cabinet ministers that Home had ruled himself out when he avowed in cabinet that in no circumstances would he be a candidate  (M. Butler, 97). At the rally that afternoon, by reading out a long letter from Macmillan and by some remarks of his own, Home upstaged Butler, whose speech flopped. His text was good but, probably unnerved by Home's revelation and conduct, he eschewed all the oratorical arts, and the applause was more dutiful than wholehearted.<br>
<br>The second round of the leadership contest was fought in London but not under Queensberry rules. The prime minister devised a procedure under which he kept control of events. By na&iuml;vely or negligently agreeing to his proposals, the cabinet effectively abdicated in favour of Macmillan and his choice&#151;a grave misjudgement by all the leadership contenders, except of course Home. And after fudged consultations with cabinet ministers by the lord chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, and with MPs by the whips, some of whom knew the answer they wanted and went on until they got it, Macmillan adjudged his contender&#151;Home&#151;the winner.<br>
<br>When Dilhorne's figures of the cabinet's voting&#151;ten for Home and only three for Butler&#151;were published many years later, they were seen to be &#145;impossible&#146;, as Macleod had judged them at the time. Dilhorne's claim that both Boyle and Macleod himself supported Home was self-evidently absurd. His phoney figures were presumably caused more by the faulty procedure, wishful thinking, incompetence, and, possibly, deafness than by outright chicanery; otherwise they would have been more plausible. Although in giving Home 87 first-choice votes of MPs to 86 for Butler, the legerdemain of the chief whip, Martin Redmayne, was less blatant than that of the lord chancellor, his accountancy, too, was creative. The news of Home's victory was leaked on 12 October 1963, the day before Macmillan was to see the queen. There was still, nevertheless, an opportunity for a third round, since a decision reached by such dubious means inevitably caused a row. That evening a meeting of cabinet ministers at Enoch Powell's house telephoned Butler urging him to fight. Hailsham did the same, telling him &#145;you must don your armour, dear Rab&#146;. Butler, who was, he said, &#145;just dozing off&#146;, merely undertook to take note of what Hailsham had said and possibly act on it; but his only response the next morning, after his doze, was to ask the lord chancellor to call a meeting of all the leading candidates (Walters, 132&#150;3; personal knowledge). Home felt like withdrawing, but was dissuaded by Macmillan, who ignored the opposition to his &#145;compromise&#146; choice and did not change his intended advice to the queen. Shortly afterwards Home was on his way to the palace, where he was asked to see if he could form a government. Even then Butler could have prevailed. Had Butler &#145;stood firm&#146;, as he later agreed with Boyd-Carpenter, he would have been prime minister  (Boyd-Carpenter, 178&#150;9). Home could not have formed a government without Butler, and without Hailsham, Maudling, Macleod, Boyle, and Powell, all of whom would have refused to serve if Butler had given a lead. Powell later spoke graphically of having handed Butler &#145;a loaded revolver and told him that all he had to do was pull the trigger&#146;  (R. Shepherd, <span class="italic">Enoch Powell</span>, 1996, 260). His wife, too, was urging him on, but his heart was not in the fight, and after reserving his position Butler became foreign secretary on 20 October. Perhaps, as his father had long ago told him, he could not take strong personal executive decisions. Perhaps, like his old chief in 1940, Halifax, he did not really want the job. More likely he was inhibited by fears of splitting the party; and Home had been a friend since their Chamberlain days. Yet certainly their &#145;friendship&#146; did not lead Butler to think that Home was fitted to be prime minister. He told Home on the day of his triumph that he spoilt the image of modernization, and shortly afterwards he described the prime minister as &#145;an amiable enough creature&#146; who did not understand economics or even education at all (Ramsden, <span class="italic">Winds of Change</span>, 209; Howard, 332).<br>
<br>In any case Butler's forbearance did not help the Conservatives. The supporters of both Butler and Hailsham thought their man would win the election of 16 October 1964, and both were probably right. Even Home only just lost it. Later Alec Home came to believe it might have been better had Butler got the top job, since anybody else was seen as a somewhat &#145;unnatural&#146; successor  (Thorpe, 310). After painful second thoughts, Macmillan in the eighties came to a similar conclusion  (Horne, 2.582).<h2>
<a name="LifepeerandmasterofTrinity"></a>Life peer and master of Trinity</h2>The rest, politically, was anticlimax. The job Butler had wanted in 1957 and 1960 no longer presented much of a challenge. He ran the Foreign Office easily, but had no opportunity or inclination to do anything of note. Had the Conservatives won the 1964 election, he would not have been reappointed. Butler was given no part in the election preparations and only a bit part in the election itself, though he gave one rather unfortunate interview, in which he agreed with a <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> journalist that the election might slip away from the tories in the last few days. After the election he lost his chairmanship of the Conservative Research Department, which he had held for twenty years. Home offered him an earldom which he refused; in 1965 the new prime minister, Harold Wilson, offered him the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge, which he accepted. He then accepted a life peerage in 1965 and took his seat on the cross-benches. Butler was the first non-Trinity man to become master for 250 years, and his appointment was at first not wholly welcome in the college. Nevertheless he and his wife were pre-eminently successful there, and in 1972 91 out of 118 fellows present voted for the maximum extension of Butler's term of office. In 1971 he published his autobiography. Lively, wise, and relatively accurate, <span class="italic">The Art of the Possible</span> was a strong contrast to the multi-volume efforts of Eden and Macmillan and was one of the very few political autobiographies to enhance its author's reputation. This was followed in 1977 by <span class="italic">The Conservatives</span>, a history of the party, which Butler edited and introduced. In the same year he retired from Trinity.<br>
<br>Butler was sworn of the privy council in 1939, and was appointed CH in 1954 and KG in 1971. He was awarded honorary degrees by thirteen universities (including Oxford and Cambridge, both in 1952), and elected an honorary fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1941, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1952, and St Antony's College, Oxford, in 1957. He was rector of Glasgow University (1956&#150;9), high steward, Cambridge University (1958&#150;66), chancellor of Sheffield University (1960&#150;78), chancellor of Essex University from 1962, and high steward of the city of Cambridge from 1963. He was president of the Modern Language Association and of the National Association of Mental Health from 1946, and of the Royal Society of Literature from 1951. He was given the freedom of Saffron Walden in 1954.<br>
<br>His son, Adam, was a member of the 1979 Conservative government, but Butler like Macmillan had no great liking for the new Conservative regime. In February 1980 he successfully opposed in the Lords the government's proposal to allow local authorities to charge for school transport, which he saw as a breach of the 1944 act's promise to provide free secondary education for all. Butler's portrait was painted by Margaret Foreman for the National Portrait Gallery, where he was last seen in public. He finished <span class="italic">The Art of Memory</span> (1982), which was little more than a footnote to its predecessor and was published after his death. He died on 8 March 1982 at his home, Spencers, in Great Yeldham, Halstead, Essex.<h2>
<a name="Achievement"></a>Achievement</h2>A Baldwinian Conservative, opposed to drastic change and dedicated to compromise, Rab Butler, even more than Macmillan, was chiefly responsible for the humane and moderate &#145;one nation&#146; toryism of the post-war period. Others, of course, played an important part. But Butler did more than anybody else to slough off the Conservatives' dismal legacy of the thirties, to commit the party to full employment and the welfare state, and hence to secure its early return to power. Similarly his failure to win the party leadership in 1963 proved a delayed but fatal blow to &#145;one nation&#146; toryism&#151;at least in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In his farewell message to the 1963 party conference, Macmillan hailed the coming into existence of &#145;the party of our dreams&#146;, which accepted a &#145;pragmatic and sensible compromise between the extremes of collectivism and individualism&#146;; yet at the very same time he was blocking from the leadership the man who had done even more than himself to establish that compromise. The 1964 election was crucial. A Conservative victory would have consolidated such a party and probably produced a Labour realignment. Defeat led to the later polarization of the parties and an abandonment of Macmillan's &#145;compromise&#146;&#151;as Macmillan and Butler both lived long enough to see. By barring Butler's way in 1963 Macmillan had inadvertently helped to turn the &#145;party of our dreams&#146; into one more like his nightmare. By the 1980s much of the party's leadership had not only repudiated &#145;the pragmatic and sensible compromise between the extremes of collectivism and individualism&#146;, it had stigmatized the governments of Macmillan himself and of other tory prime ministers as misguided collaborators with the socialist enemy.<br>
<br>A man of great intelligence, Butler was in most respects superbly equipped for politics. He was sometimes accused of deviousness, but he was often more honest (and more indiscreet) than his colleagues. His trouble was not that he was more devious than them, merely that he was worse at it. Indeed he retained a strong vein of innocence, rare in sophisticated politicians. He was also abnormally good-natured, and inspired great affection. Yet at crucial periods he was unable fully to mobilize his support in the parliamentary party and he was inept at advancing his own claims. Hence Eden and Macmillan were able to push him around almost at will and to land him with unsuitable offices; that was made easier for them, too, by Butler being more a public servant than a politician. His achievement as both, however, was immense.<br>
