<span class="headword">College of justice,  procurators of the</span>  (<em>act. </em>1532), <span class="occ">lawyers</span>, were the eight men admitted by the lords of session to act as procurators and advocates in all actions coming before the college of justice when that court was established in Edinburgh in 1532. The precise significance of this event has been a matter of historical debate, and emphasis has been placed on preceding institutional developments and on the regular and increasingly specialized judicial &#145;sessions&#146; which were held to deal with civil matters, leading in turn to the foundation of a central civil court. This view has led to a downgrading of the events of 1532. The college was founded using money diverted from papal revenues with the consent of Pope Clement VII, and has been seen as merely an example of James V's opportunism in appropriating church funds to his own use. Legal historians, however, have pointed to jurisdictional issues which suggest that the foundation marked, if not a new departure, then at least an important milestone in the development of Scots law.<br>
<br>All eight advocates were well educated (most of them attended continental as well as Scottish universities) and forensically skilled.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_10288"></a><span class="headword">Robert Galbraith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1544)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of David Galbraith (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1480), of Kimmerghame in Berwickshire. Having graduated MA from the University of Paris in 1503 he lectured in logic at the Coll&egrave;ge de Coqueret. In 1510 he published a book on logic, <span class="italic">Quadrupertitum</span>, which was reprinted in 1516. He also wrote works of poetry, though none appears to have survived. Before the end of 1515 Galbraith had returned to Scotland and was appearing as an advocate before the lords of council. He represented Margaret Tudor as queen's advocate, from her return to Scotland in June 1517 probably until her death in 1541. Designated as a chaplain in 1526, Galbraith became treasurer of the Chapel Royal in Stirling in 1528. Before 1526 Galbraith had been made a burgess of Edinburgh and as early as 1516 he had been one of a number of people asked to convene in the Tolbooth to advise the burgh council. During his career as an advocate Galbraith acted for more than 250 clients before taking office as a lord of session on 7 November 1537. By that time he had also become parson of Spott in Haddingtonshire. As well as holding lands in the vicinity of the Tolbooth in Edinburgh, from 1523 he began acquiring property in Haddingtonshire and Berwickshire, particularly the estate of East Windshiel. Galbraith was murdered by John Carkettle of Finglen and others in Greyfriars kirkyard, Edinburgh, on 27 January 1544; the motive for the killing remains unknown. The murderers were granted a remission on payment of assythment to Galbraith's kin; part of the money was spent employing a chaplain at St Giles's, Edinburgh, to say prayers for his soul. Galbraith left behind a manuscript of legal sources which was later used by James Balfour of Pittendreich in compiling his <span class="italic">Practicks</span> and referred to by him as the &#145;Liber Galbraith&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60983"></a><span class="headword">William Johnston</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1516&#150;1550)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of the Edinburgh burgess James Johnston (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1500&#150;1516). He graduated in arts from St Andrews in 1516 and then studied law at the University of Orl&eacute;ans, where in 1518 he was elected procurator of the Scots nation. The following year he received David Beaton (the future cardinal) there as a novice. In 1524, along with Henry Lauder, he was appointed sheriff of Linlithgowshire <i>in hac parte</i> (to hear a specific case only). Johnston's legal career as an advocate was reasonably busy by the late 1520s and he acted as commissary of Lothian in 1531. In 1534 he was appointed to an embassy to England, where he appears to have had numerous protestant contacts. Later that year he was accused of heresy and fled abroad, later being escheated. Johnston subsequently recanted but his goods were again escheated in 1550 after sentence of relapse was pronounced against him. He survived the Reformation but his later career remains obscure.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60986"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Kincraigie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1564)<span class="occ"></span> was the legitimated natural son of James Kincraigie (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1500), dean of Aberdeen. A student of arts at St Andrews, Kincraigie's legal career leaned heavily towards the church courts, though he also had a steady practice in the secular courts from the late 1520s. He may also have worked briefly in the royal chancery, since in 1532 he received a payment from the fees of the privy seal. In 1528 he acted as commissary in that part for James Beaton, archbishop of St Andrews, and later he acted as his procurator fiscal, an office he subsequently retained under Cardinal David Beaton. In 1548 Kincraigie was appointed advocate for the poor&#151;an office which he probably held, sometimes in conjunction with other advocates, until his death in 1564.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60988"></a><span class="headword">Henry Lauder of St Germains</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1561)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of the Edinburgh burgess Gilbert Lauder (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1490) and Margaret McCalzeane (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1490). He married Agnes Stewart and they had a son, Gilbert, and possibly other children. A graduate by November 1513, Lauder may have studied abroad. He was certainly admitted burgess of Edinburgh before the end of 1517. In that year he also began appearing as an advocate before the lords of council and by the late 1520s his legal services were very heavily in demand. This continued until 1538, when he replaced Adam Otterburn as king's advocate. Earlier that year he had made a speech of welcome in French to Mary of Guise on her entry into Edinburgh and had also acted as deputy to the marischal in parliament. In January 1539 the king directed that Lauder be permitted to remain in the council chamber so that he could intervene in any case where the king's interest was affected. This was a temporary measure until Lauder could fill a vacancy on the bench, which he had done by March 1540. Lauder remained king's advocate, holding the office jointly from 1555 with John Spens of Condie, until he died on 19 July 1561.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60987"></a><span class="headword">Robert Leslie of Inverpeffer</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1536)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of Walter Leslie (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1480), parson of Menmuir and commissary of Dunkeld. His mother is unknown. Leslie married Christine Wardlaw and they had six children: Andrew, John, George, Gilbert, Elizabeth, and Janet. He also had a sister, Euphemia, who with his help became the last prioress of the Cistercian convent at Elcho in Perthshire. In return for his assistance Leslie received in feu-farm from the convent the lands of Kinnaird in Fife. Little is known of his education, though he may have been a determinant at the University of St Andrews in 1508. By 1518 he had become a burgess of Edinburgh, but it was in Fife and the north-east that his legal career took root. His major client in the area was, for over two decades, George Leslie, fourth earl of Rothes, to whom he may have been related through his father. By 1525 Leslie had acquired the estate of Inverpeffer in the sheriffdom of Forfar. A year later he was described as keeper of the signet, and in 1529 as custodian of the privy seal. Leslie last appeared before the lords of council on 31 July 1536. He was dead by 1 December that year. In 1540 James V had the corpse exhumed so that it could be tried for <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</i>, alleging Leslie's involvement in a 1529 plot to kill the king. There is no evidence of any such involvement.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60985"></a><span class="headword">John Lethame</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1549)<span class="occ"></span> was of unknown origins. He had obtained an arts degree, possibly by studying abroad, before October 1507, when he is described as a cleric of Glasgow diocese, and recorded in Edinburgh acting as a notary by apostolic authority. In April 1511 he was evidently studying at the University of Orl&eacute;ans, being then elected procurator of the Scots nation there. Lethame's career as an advocate began around 1514 and reached the peak of its success in the years immediately after 1532. In 1521 he acted as commissary of Lothian and may have retained that office throughout the 1520s. By 1527 he had become subdean of Trinity collegiate church near Edinburgh and he later became parson of Kirkchrist. In 1530 he is referred to as commissary of the Chapel Royal at Stirling and from that date there are references to him as commissary south of the Forth. Lethame became a lord of session, apparently sitting for the first time in that capacity on 10 December 1538, though there is no record of him taking the oath <i>de fideli administratione</i>. He resigned the parsonage of Kirkchrist on 17 April 1542 and died before 13 February 1549.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60984"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Marjoribankis of Ratho</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1561)<span class="occ"></span> was originally from the diocese of Glasgow (or possibly from Dumfries), and was educated at the University of Orl&eacute;ans where he was procurator of the Scottish nation in 1517. He married Janet Purves before 1523 and they had four sons, John, Thomas, Robert, and James; Marjoribankis also had a natural daughter, Janet. His name does not appear in the Edinburgh burgess roll until 1538, even though he obtained the status of burgess by right of his wife. The timing may be explained by the fact that in 1538 he also acted as a burgh assessor. Marjoribankis's career as an advocate progressed during the 1520s and reached its peak in the 1530s. In 1535 he and John Gladstanes were appointed advocates for the poor; the following year he acted as clerk to the king's treasurer. Two years later he produced a letter from the king before the lords which granted actions involving advocates the same privileged status in court procedure as those concerning judges. A creditor to Cardinal Beaton and his relatives, Marjoribankis had trading connections with France; in 1545 he was &#145;custumar&#146; of Inverness and in the following year he was granted the privilege of exempting his merchandise from royal customs. In 1549 he was appointed lord clerk register and also purchased a share in a three-year lease of the mint. Marjoribankis purchased part of the estate of Ratho in Lothian in 1538. He became secured creditor in the rest of the estate in 1540 and eventually became infeft as owner, his title surviving legal challenge in 1547. Although dismissed as clerk register in 1554 and replaced by James MacGill, Thomas Marjoribankis does not appear to have died until about 1561, when he was succeeded by his grandson, Thomas.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60982"></a><span class="headword">Henry Spittall</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1536)<span class="occ"></span> appears to have been the son of James Spittall (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1490), of Blairlogy in Perthshire; his mother is unknown. Hector Boece describes him as a relative of William Elphinstone, bishop of Aberdeen, but the degree of relationship is not known. Spittall is first recorded attending the commissary court in Aberdeen in January 1508, several months before he became a student at the University of Orl&eacute;ans. He returned to Aberdeen, becoming canonist at the university in 1512 and rector of Snow Kirk. Spittall married Margaret Bothwell, an event which in February 1517 allowed him to be admitted as a burgess of Edinburgh, and in 1525 he became a bailie of the burgh. Spittall later married, as his second wife, Elizabeth Forbes. Following his first marriage he maintained links with Aberdeen, becoming in 1518 clerk of the coquet of that burgh. By then he was also a notary by apostolic authority. From 1516 until his death he remained one of the busiest advocates in the realm, with numerous clients particularly in Fife and the north-east. He died without legitimate children in 1536, when he was succeeded by his nephew, Alexander Spittall. A natural son, James, was legitimated in 1558.<br>
<br>The surviving evidence for the careers of these eight advocates indicates that the highest rank of the nascent legal profession in Scotland was comparable in standard to similar professions elsewhere. At the foundation of the college of justice, the judges made a restatement of the ethical and professional standards expected of advocates, and there is some evidence during the following decade of the development of corporate identity among the leading advocates. It is also apparent that their practice could be a source of considerable personal profit. Although there is much that remains obscure about the origin of the Faculty of Advocates, there can be no doubt that its early development was greatly advanced by the events of 1532, and by the distinguished careers of nearly all the men appointed in that year.<br>
