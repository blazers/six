<span class="headword">&Oacute; N&eacute;ill,  Eoghan</span> <span class="st"> [Owen or Eugene O'Neill]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1456), <span class="occ">king or lord of T&iacute;r Eoghain</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55287/', "Niall &#211;g &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1403)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50029/', "&#211; N&#233;ill, Niall M&#243;r")</script>] and his wife, &Uacute;na (<i>d</i>. 1417), the daughter of Domhnall &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. He had clearly reached military age by 21 July 1399 when he slew Cathal, son of Ruaidhr&iacute; M&aacute;g Uidhir at a time when Niall &Oacute;g was forcing submission from all Ulster apart from &Oacute; Domhnaill, the lord of T&iacute;r Conaill. However, by 1403 Niall &Oacute;g faced rebellion from his nephews, the sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20771/', "&#201;inr&#237; &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1392)")</script>. A matter of months after Niall &Oacute;g's death, his eldest son and heir, Brian &Oacute;g, died from smallpox and the kingship of T&iacute;r Eoghain was seized by Domhnall Bog 
    (&#145;Donal the Soft&#146; or &#145;the Generous&#146;; <i>d</i>. 1432)
  , son of &Eacute;inr&iacute; Aimhr&eacute;idh, who was inaugurated as &Oacute; N&eacute;ill in 1404. Eoghan, however, retained influence over M&aacute;g Uidhir of Fermanagh, and was married to Caitr&iacute;ona (<i>d</i>. 1427), the daughter of Ardghal Mac Mathghamhna (king of the Monaghan area from 1403 to 1411), and mother of his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20772/', "&#201;inr&#237; &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1489)")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1410 Eoghan &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's brother-in-law, Brian, captured Domhnall Bog, precipitating civil war in T&iacute;r Eoghain. Eoghan himself was imprisoned by the sons of his uncle, &Eacute;inr&iacute; Aimhr&eacute;idh, in 1414 and released only in exchange for the reinstatement of their leader, Domhnall Bog. In 1419&#150;20, however, Eoghan, in alliance with &Oacute; Domhnaill, M&aacute;g Uidhir, and Brian Mac Mathghamhna ignominiously drove Domhnall Bog out of T&iacute;r Eoghain to seek refuge with the English settlers of Down. Within a year peace was patched up again. Domhnall Bog retained his title as the Great &Oacute; N&eacute;ill (as he was known in the English pale), but became politically insignificant thereafter. During the prolonged struggle both &Oacute; Domhnaill in the west and the Anglo-Irish government in the east had expanded their influence.<br>
<br>In 1421 Eoghan &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was on his way to meet James Butler, fourth earl of Ormond, at Dundalk when he was captured by &Oacute; N&eacute;ill of Clandeboye. When ransomed a year later by his wife and sons, Eoghan allied with Niall Garbh &Oacute; Domhnaill, the new king of T&iacute;r Conaill, to ravage &Oacute; N&eacute;ill of Clandeboye, forcing him to submit and join a general federation of Ulster chiefs who invaded northern Connacht in 1422 and the English of Meath and Louth in 1423, defeated the justiciar's army, and imposed &#145;black-rent&#146; (protection money which subsequently developed into a customary annual payment) on the town of Dundalk. This brought Edmund (V) Mortimer, fifth earl of March and Ulster, to Ireland as lieutenant in the autumn of 1424. The Ulster chiefs came to Trim Castle that Christmas to submit, but Mortimer died suddenly on 18 January 1425 and the visitors were promptly arrested by Sir John Talbot, though subsequently released by the new lieutenant, the earl of Ormond, in exchange for ransom and hostages. In his indenture with Ormond on 23 July 1425, Eoghan &Oacute; N&eacute;ill acknowledged himself vassal to the duke of York, Mortimer's heir, and significantly undertook to desert and inform on any treasonable confederation. Once home he allied with Domhnall Bog to recover land lost to &Oacute; Domhnaill during their contentions. He rebuilt his father's authority over the province, adding the allegiance of &Oacute; Raighilligh of East Br&eacute;ifne in 1429. In 1430 he once again harried Louth, took black-rent from Dundalk, then received submissions from the Irish chieftains of Longford and Westmeath, Baron Nugent of Delvin (an ally of Ormond), and the Plunkets and Herberts, before making war on the other English in Meath.<br>
<br>In 1432 Eoghan &Oacute; N&eacute;ill at last succeeded Domhnall Bog as the Great &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. He then forced &Oacute; Domhnaill to submit, and in the course of a joint raid into Louth in 1434 the latter was conveniently captured by the English. After submitting to Ormond once more in 1441, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill next year used English troops to win a crushing victory against the new &Oacute; Domhnaill. However, he made war on Louth in 1444, in 1449 just before the duke of York's visit, and again in 1452; and he and his then wife, Evelina Baret, incurred archiepiscopal censure for infringing the property rights of Armagh. In 1455 Archbishop John Mey sanctioned a transfer of the chieftainship from Eoghan to his eldest son, &Eacute;inr&iacute;, on grounds of infirmity, though the annals speak of forcible deposition, and the retired chief died the following year.<br>
