<span class="headword">Thatcher, Sir  Denis</span>, first baronet  (1915&#150;2003), <span class="occ">businessman and prime ministerial consort</span>, was born on 10 May 1915 at 26 Southbrook Road, Lee, Lewisham, London, the elder child of Thomas Herbert (Jack) Thatcher, businessman, and his wife, (Lilian) Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bird. From the age of eight he boarded at a preparatory school in Bognor, then at Mill Hill, a leading nonconformist public school. He joined the family paint and preservatives business at eighteen, volunteering for the army shortly after the Munich crisis of September 1938 because he was convinced that war would shortly come. His character was partly shaped by army discipline and camaraderie. Although to his regret he saw no real fighting, he was mentioned twice in dispatches and left the forces in 1946 with the rank of major and a military MBE. He returned to run the family business, his father having died, aged fifty-seven, in 1943. A brief, childless wartime marriage on 28 March 1942 to Margaret (Margot) Kempson, daughter of Leonard Kempson, businessman, ended in divorce in 1948. In February 1949 he met Margaret Hilda Roberts (<i>b</i>. 1925), daughter of Alfred Roberts, grocer, at a dinner in Dartford where she was the newly selected Conservative parliamentary candidate. They married on 13 December 1951.<br>
<br>Denis Thatcher brought his new wife many gifts. His income funded her training as a barrister and a home in fashionable Chelsea. He was a cheerfully hedonistic, irreverent, and good-natured man, with a talent for friendship, qualities that banished the rigours of Margaret's Grantham upbringing (if not the habit of hard work and self-control to which they gave rise). Twins&#151;Mark and Carol&#151;were born in August 1953, Margaret entering parliament six years later as Conservative MP for Finchley. Through the early years of his wife's political career Denis Thatcher worked long days running his firm (which employed 200 by 1957). He suffered a mild breakdown in 1964, took a short break, alone, in South Africa (which he later acknowledged &#145;shook Margaret&#146;), and decided to sell the business to Castrol. He received &pound;10,000 of the &pound;530,000 purchase price and a seat on the parent board, maintaining a senior position when Castrol was taken over by Burmah Oil in 1969. A large house at Lamberhurst in Kent was bought in 1965. Kent was his true home, greatly preferred to London, where business and Margaret's career forced him to spend so much time. When Margaret ran for the Conservative leadership in February 1975 Denis frankly told her she had no chance of winning, but he would back her all the way. He retired at sixty, months after she became leader, freeing him to play a full supporting role in her career. The premiership followed four years later.<br>
<br>Early in life Denis Thatcher had taken to heart a favourite saying of his father's: &#145;it is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than open it and remove all doubt&#146;. As he felt his way into the role of male prime ministerial consort&#151;unprecedented in Britain and a novelty anywhere&#151;he consistently followed that advice, refusing interviews and making only occasional speeches, anodyne and brief. He deeply regretted a single lapse, when in December 1979 at a dinner of the London Society of Rugby Football Union Referees (of which he was treasurer, having refereed at a club level for many years) he made remarks criticizing the sporting boycott of South Africa. He felt the consequent controversy was at his wife's expense.<br>
<br>Paradoxically a policy of silence worked well for him partly because other people started speaking for him. After May 1979 the satirical magazine <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> began publishing &#145;Dear Bill&#146;, a regular spoof letter to a golfing chum, gifting him the comic persona of a gin-soaked buffoon, married to a workaholic dominatrix who happened to run the country. Denis saw the advantages of playing along with &#145;Dear Bill&#146; (he had little choice), and grew into the part. Did he have a drink problem, he was once asked? &#145;Yes, Madam, I can never get enough.&#146; What did he do with his time at number 10? &#145;Well, when I'm not pissed, I play a lot of golf.&#146;<br>
<br>More than anything else Denis Thatcher saw his role in Downing Street as helping his wife survive the stress of the premiership. He worked hard to relax her and sustain her self-confidence (which was not as unshakeable as most assumed). She would not have functioned politically at such a high level, and for as long as she did, without him. Perhaps no British prime minister has depended more heavily on a spouse. He made probably his most significant attempt to influence her career when he urged her to leave office around the time of her tenth anniversary as prime minister, shrewdly judging that otherwise she would go at a time not of her choosing. He was the first in her immediate circle to realize that the end had come when Geoffrey Howe resigned in November 1990.<br>
<br>Denis Thatcher was made a baronet in 1991 (the first created since 1964), and his wife a life peer, as Baroness Thatcher, in 1992. In the years following, the continued intrusions of security and staff in the Thatchers' lives sometimes irritated him, but he remained remarkable for his self-effacing amiability and humour. Few who knew him had anything but warm regard. He died of pancreatic cancer at the Lister Hospital, Westminster, on 26 June 2003. He was survived by his wife, who died on 8 April 2013, and their two children, and succeeded as baronet by his son, Mark.<br>
