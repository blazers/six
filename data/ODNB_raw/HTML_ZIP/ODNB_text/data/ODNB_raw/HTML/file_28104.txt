<span class="headword">Vansittart,  Henry</span>  (1777&#150;1843), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the fifth son of George Vansittart (1745&#150;1825) of Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, and his wife, Sarah, the daughter of the Revd Sir James Stonhouse, bt, was born in George Street, Hanover Square, London, on 17 April 1777. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28102/', "George Henry Vansittart")</script> was his elder brother, Henry Vansittart, governor of Bengal, was his uncle, and Nicholas Vansittart, first Baron Bexley, was his first cousin. Having been entered on the books of the guardship <i>Scipio</i> in the Medway in October 1788, he was afterwards nominally in the guardship <i>Boyne</i> in the Thames, and probably actually served in the <i>Pegasus</i> on the Newfoundland station in 1791. In 1792 he was in the <i>Hannibal</i>, stationed at Plymouth, and in 1793 went out to the Mediterranean in the <i>Princess Royal</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Goodall. During the siege of Toulon by the republican army he was severely wounded. After the evacuation he was moved into the frigate <i>L'Aigle</i>, with Captain Samuel Hood, served at the siege of Calvi, and was in October 1794 moved into the <i>Victory</i>, in which he returned to England. On 21 February 1795 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Stately</i> (64 guns), in which he was present at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope and of the Dutch squadron in Saldanha Bay. He was then moved into the <i>Monarch</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Elphinstone (later Viscount Keith), and returned in her to England.<br>
<br>Vansittart was next appointed to the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, Keith's flagship in the channel, and on 30 May 1798 was promoted commander of the sloop <i>Hermes</i>. From her he was moved to the <i>Bonetta</i>, which he took out to Jamaica, and on 13 February 1801 he was posted to the <i>Abergavenny</i> (54 guns), stationed at Port Royal. In July he returned to England in the <i>Thunderer</i> (74 guns). After a few months on half pay he was appointed, in April 1802, to the frigate <i>Magicienne</i>, from which, in January 1803, he was moved to the <i>Fortun&eacute;e</i> (36 guns). He remained commander of this ship for upwards of nine years, in the North Sea, off Boulogne, in the channel, in the West Indies, and in the Mediterranean, mostly cruising and convoying. He married, in 1809, Mary Charity (<i>d</i>. 1834), the daughter of the Revd John Pennefather, with whom he had five children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36629/', "Edward Westby Vansittart")</script>. From August 1812 to March 1814 he was on the <i>Clarence</i> (74 guns). With the exception of a few months in 1801&#150;2 he had served continuously from 1791. He became rear-admiral on 22 July 1830 and vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. He died on 21 March 1843 at his seat, Eastwood, Woodstock, Canada.<br>
