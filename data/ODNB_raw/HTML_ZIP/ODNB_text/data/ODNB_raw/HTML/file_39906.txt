</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Goodall, Sir  Reginald</span>  (1901&#150;1990), <span class="occ">conductor</span>, was born in Lincoln on 13 July 1901, the elder son of Albert Edward Goodall, solicitor's clerk, and his wife, Adelaide Jones. There was also a half-sister from Albert Goodall's previous marriage. Reginald went to Lincoln Cathedral choir school from 1910 to 1914, after which his education continued at Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, and in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, following the breakdown of his parents' marriage and their decision to emigrate, his mother to the United States and his father to Canada. He left school at fifteen and undertook a variety of work, as a messenger for the railways, a clerk in an engineering works, and in a bank in Burlington. His earnings enabled him to study at the Hamilton Conservatory of Music, which led to his appointment as organist of St Alban the Martyr Cathedral, Toronto, and as a music master at Upper Canada College. As the result of meeting Sir Hugh Allen in Canada, he became a student at the Royal College of Music, London, in 1925. In 1932 he married Eleanor Katherine Edith (<i>d</i>. 1979), schoolteacher, daughter of Montagu Gipps, of independent means; they had no children.<br>
<br>It was not until 1935 that Goodall conducted his first opera, <span class="italic">Carmen</span>, with a semi-professional company in London. In the meantime he had established himself as organist and choirmaster of St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, and he gave the first performances in England of Bruckner's F minor mass and other works. Each year he travelled on the continent as piano accompanist for the teacher and lieder singer Reinhold von Warlich. He was thus able to hear some of the world's great conductors, such as Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler and Hans Knappertsbusch. In 1936 Goodall was engaged by Covent Garden to train the chorus for <span class="italic">Boris Godunov</span>, conducted by Albert Coates. He did this so well that he was asked to remain for the winter season. An invitation for the 1937 summer season followed, but he declined this in favour of other artistically less rewarding but financially more secure work. The 1930s were difficult for Goodall and the prospect of war filled him with gloom, as he envisaged the collapse of the German culture which he had come to know and love. Politically na&iuml;ve, but at heart a serious pacifist, he supported Sir Oswald Mosley and his demand for negotiations with Hitler.<br>
<br>Apart from a brief spell of military service, in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps from April to September 1943, Goodall spent the war conducting, first the Wessex Philharmonic Orchestra and then the Sadler's Wells Opera. The latter introduced him to a repertory with which he was not familiar and much of which he did not admire. However, he conducted the premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> by Benjamin Britten, at the reopening of the Sadler's Wells theatre on 7 June 1945. So impressed was the composer that he invited Goodall to conduct the premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucretia</span> at Glyndebourne's first post-war season the following year, although he shared the conducting with Ernest Ansermet. In 1947 Goodall became second conductor with the newly formed opera company at Covent Garden. This was a low period for him, with much of his time devoted to conducting Verdi, a composer he despised. In 1951 his contract as conductor was terminated and he continued as a coach. He was an invaluable teacher to the many singers who passed through his hands. There were occasional excursions into conducting for Covent Garden. In 1968 Goodall conducted <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span> at Sadler's Wells and again revealed his understanding of Richard Wagner. Following this success, Sadler's Wells invited him to conduct the four <span class="italic">Ring</span> operas at the Coliseum. These were nothing short of triumphant. He then went on to conduct <span class="italic">Tristan und Isolde</span> with the Welsh National Opera in 1979, and <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> with the English National Opera. Critical and public response was ecstatic, and both these performances were recorded.<br>
<br>A small, dishevelled, and sometimes cantankerous man, Goodall gave at first sight little indication of the strong inspirational force that he undoubtedly had as a conductor and coach. His conducting technique in a conventional sense was sketchy, but given time for preparation and rehearsal with singers and orchestra, which not every opera company could provide, the resulting performances were astonishing and profoundly moving in their revelations. He had a rare understanding of the architecture of Wagner's music. The long, slowly unfolding spans were wonderfully shaped and realized with unforced sonority. Goodall allowed the music to flow naturally and at the same time to give singers the greatest support without drowning them. He was appointed CBE in 1975 and knighted in 1985. He had honorary degrees from Leeds (1974), Newcastle (1974), and Oxford (1986). Goodall died on 5 May 1990 in a nursing home at Bridge, near Canterbury.<br>
