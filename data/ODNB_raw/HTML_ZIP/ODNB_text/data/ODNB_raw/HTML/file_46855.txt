<span class="headword">Cronshaw,  Cecil John Turrell</span>  (1889&#150;1961), <span class="occ">industrial chemist and businessman</span>, was born on 13 June 1889 at Heywood in Lancashire, the son of William Robert Cronshaw, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Anne Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turrell. He was educated at Bury grammar school and apprenticed for a time to J. H. Leicester at the Manchester chamber of commerce testing house. He subsequently attended the Victoria University of Manchester and in 1913 graduated with first-class honours in chemistry. After a short spell with the synthetic rubber manufacturers, Strange and Graham, in 1915 he joined the dyestuff firm of Levinstein Ltd, based at Blackley, Manchester. There he acted as assistant to James Baddiley, who was developing a research team at the firm. On 1 December 1917 he married Annie, the daughter of John Downham, a consulting engineer; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Cronshaw worked first on oleum manufacture, but his most important achievements were connected with organic chemicals, notably dyestuffs and pharmaceuticals. He was one of the generation of industrial chemists educated in Britain who rebuilt the country's synthetic dyestuff industry during and after the First World War, following its earlier eclipse by Germany. Only a handful of small British dyestuff firms had survived and Levinsteins was perhaps the leader of these. Cronshaw undertook some chemical work himself, at Levinsteins and later, but his major contribution was in management, and the promotion and organization of research. In 1916 he was placed in charge of the synthetic indigo plant at Ellesmere Port which had been appropriated from the German firm of Meister, Lucius and Br&uuml;ning, and with his colleagues brought it into operation in three months. The main focus of his work was the production of intermediaries required for the process, notably phenylglycine, which had previously been imported from Germany. The range of his activities soon widened. He was involved in technical negotiations with the American firm of Du Pont for the purchase of manufacturing processes from Levinstein. After the armistice he was, for a year, controller of chemical factories in the Rhineland area. When he returned to Britain in 1919 he became assistant to Herbert Levinstein, managing director of the newly formed British Dyestuffs Corporation, which incorporated the two major companies, Levinstein and British Dyes Ltd, of Huddersfield. Cronshaw was quickly appointed head of production control and then works manager at Blackley, and by 1924 he was technical manager of the company.<br>
<br>British Dyestuffs Corporation was one of the four main firms which merged to form ICI in 1926. Cronshaw's acknowledged range of experience led to his appointment as technical director of ICI's Dyestuffs Group, which represented the major organic element in the company's business. From this position and, later, as managing director on its delegate board, he widened the group's technical interests into synthetic rubber and pharmaceuticals. The latter area was eventually constituted as a separate division (groups were renamed divisions in ICI in 1943). The growth of the Dyestuffs Group was influenced by Cronshaw's emphasis on research and his recruitment of high-calibre graduates, an approach which was met with scepticism in some quarters, but supported elsewhere in ICI, notably by F. A. Freeth of the Alkali Group. During the mid-1930s Cronshaw promoted the exploitation of a major new chromogen (that is, a chemical structure common to numerous dyestuffs) based on phthalocyanine. For this work, twenty-five years later, he received the Perkin medal of the Society of Dyers and Colourists. Outside the technical domain Cronshaw negotiated the entry into Dyestuffs Group of such firms as the British Alizarine Company, and the group's administrative structure was largely his creation. From 1939 until 1943 he was chairman of the delegate board. He joined the main board of ICI in 1939 and remained a member until his retirement in 1952. During this time he promoted new technical initiatives of many kinds, extending from new drugs to the development of plant for the cracking of oil fractions on Teesside.<br>
<br>Despite increasing administrative and commercial responsibilities, Cronshaw retained a strong professional and technical involvement in the industry. He acted as president of the Society of Dyers and Colourists from 1939 to 1946 and received a variety of honours, including an honorary DSc. from the University of Leeds (1938), and the silver medal of the Royal Society of Arts (1940). He was a small man, of mercurial disposition and quick wit, with interests in music, cricket, and yachting. Indeed, his wit was said to be too barbed for the taste of some of his junior colleagues, though he was not intentionally unkind. He had an interest in and respect for young people and was a governor of his old school and university. For most of his life he lived at Prestwich, Manchester, and latterly at Alnwick, Prestwich Park. After a prolonged illness, he died in Cheadle Royal Infirmary on 5 January 1961.<br>
