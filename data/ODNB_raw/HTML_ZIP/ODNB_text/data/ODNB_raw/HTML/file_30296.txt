<span class="headword">Zincke,  Foster Barham</span>  (1817&#150;1893), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 5 January 1817, at Eardley, a sugar estate in Jamaica, the third son of Frederick Burt Zincke, of Jamaica and his wife, a Miss Lawrence, a descendant of Henry Lawrence, president of Cromwell's council. He was fourth in descent from Christian Frederick Zincke, the German miniature and enamel painter. He passed most of his childhood on the sugar estate, living a free outdoor life. He returned to England with his mother to enter Bedford grammar school in 1828, where he developed a particular interest in geography. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 5 March 1835, graduating BA on 18 May 1839. With his once wealthy family in financial difficulty after the emancipation of the slaves, his godmothers paid for him to attend university and he afterwards had to support himself. He was ordained in 1840 and became curate of Andover in 1840 and of Wherstead and Freston near Ipswich in 1841. He was appointed vicar there in 1847 and remained there for the rest of his life, despite being offered good livings and headships of schools and colleges elsewhere. He published a work on extempore preaching (1866, American edition 1867) after becoming aware of how ill his bookish sermons suited his unlettered congregation. He also began to contribute to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and in 1852 published <span class="italic">Some Thoughts about the School of the Future</span> in which he criticized the system of education of English universities and public schools. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the queen's chaplains, through the influence of Prince Albert with whom he had discussed educational matters.<br>
<br>Zincke loved travel. In September 1853 he visited Ireland and became convinced that the distress there was due largely to English misrule, particularly by absent exploitative landlords. In 1867&#150;8 he visited the USA and gave an appreciative view of the country in <span class="italic">Last Winter in the United States</span> (1868). A visit to Egypt was recorded in print (1871) and he published three books on travel in Switzerland (1873, 1874, and 1875).<br>
<br>On 30 May 1865 Zincke married at St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, Caroline Octavia, Lady Stevenson, daughter of Joseph Seymour Biscoe and widow of Zincke's cousin, Sir William Stevenson; they had no children. In 1885 Zincke energetically supported his stepson Francis Seymour Stevenson who stood successfully for election as a Liberal MP. From then on Zincke took an active part in local politics and wrote many pamphlets expressing radical and humane views. His <span class="italic">The Plough and the Dollar, or, The Englishry of a Century Hence</span> (1883) was an interesting exercise in speculation, involving him in correspondence with Gladstone. He continued to write on various other themes, including a local history of Wherstead (1887 and 1893) and in 1891 published an autobiography, which, like all his works, whatever their ostensible theme, contained thoughtful comments on the condition of life and how it could be improved. He died at Wherstead vicarage on 23 August 1893 and was buried in the churchyard there on 26 August.<br>
