<span class="headword">Woodcock,  George</span>  (1912&#150;1995), <span class="occ">writer and journal editor</span>, was born at Grace Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba, on 8 May 1912, the only child of (Samuel) Arthur Woodcock (<i>d</i>. 1926), railway clerk, and his wife, Margaret Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lewis (<i>d</i>. 1940). His parents had moved to Canada a few years previously in search of a better life, and his father at one point worked as a silver prospector, but they returned to England when George was only a few months old. There, partly through family connections, his father obtained a post with Great Western Railways. He was educated at Sir William Borlase's School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where his parents lived. He was unable to go on to university because of family poverty following his father's early death, and for eleven years (from 1929 to 1940) he too worked as a railway clerk for Great Western Railways in London. At the same time he began to make his name as a writer in small circulation magazines and he joined the literary bohemia of pre-war London; he also became involved in left-wing politics, moving from socialism to pacifism and also to anarchism.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Woodcock was a conscientious objector and worked on the land. At the same time he made his name as an editor, producing sixteen issues of his own magazine, <span class="italic">Now</span>, from 1940 to 1947. From 1942 he worked with the Freedom Press, the main British publisher of anarchist material, producing many articles and several pamphlets. In 1945, when three of the editors of its paper <span class="italic">War Commentary</span> were imprisoned for anti-war activity, he helped to keep the paper going while they were in prison and he founded the Freedom Defence Committee on behalf of dissenters who were too unpopular for anyone else. From 1943 he lived with Ingeborg Hedwig Elisabeth Roskelly, an artist, daughter of Otto Linzer, a ministry of finance inspector in Germany, and wife of Frederick Roskelly, an English journalist. She had left Germany in 1936. Following a divorce in which Woodcock was named as co-respondent, he and Ingeborg married on 20 January 1949.<br>
<br>After the war Woodcock began to produce successful general books, and he was on the verge of becoming an established author in England when in 1949 he returned with his wife to Canada. He spent the rest of his life there, though he frequently visited Britain and had most of his later books published in London. He and Ingeborg settled in British Columbia and had a hard struggle at first; he earned initially a precarious and eventually a prosperous living as a writer and broadcaster. From 1954 to 1956 he taught English at the University of Washington (until excluded from the United States because of his political views). He then taught English at the University of British Columbia from 1956 to 1963, becoming associate professor. Thereafter he preferred independent to academic status, though he retained a connection with the University of British Columbia and from 1966 to 1967 was a full-time lecturer in Asian studies. He became a leading advocate of and authority on Canadian literature, and was the founding editor of the prestigious academic quarterly <span class="italic">Canadian Literature</span> from 1959 to 1977. He and his wife spent much time travelling all over the world; they were also involved in relief work in India and Tibet, and established a fund for impoverished writers in Canada. In later years Woodcock developed a keen interest in Tibetan Buddhism, and on several occasions met the Dalai Lama.<br>
<br>Woodcock was the author or editor of well over 150 books over a period of sixty years. He produced biographical studies of H. W. Bates (1969), Aphra Behn (1948), Gabriel Dumont (1975), Mahatma Gandhi (1972), William Godwin (1948), Aldous Huxley (1972), Peter Kropotkin (1950), Wyndham Lewis (1971), Malcolm Lowry (1971), Hugh MacLellan (1969), Thomas Merton (1978), George Orwell (1966), P. J. Proudhon (1956), Herbert Read (1972), Mordecai Richler (1971), and Oscar Wilde (1950). He produced several works of literary criticism and edited several political and literary classics. He also produced many books of travel and anthropology, and on history and politics, several collections of essays, and entries in many reference books. Above all he wrote two standard books, <span class="italic">Anarchism: a History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">Canada and the Canadians</span> (1970). The former became one of the most widely read and influential studies of the subject, and appeared in many editions and translations. He later added, as a companion volume, the anthology <span class="italic">Anarchist Reader</span> (1977). The two books established his permanent reputation, though they were both the object of much controversy. Towards the end of his life he provided the introductions for a new collection of the main writings of Peter Kropotkin in eleven volumes. However, he thought of himself primarily as a poet, and his poems were published over a period of sixty-two years and collected in several volumes. Towards the end of his life he produced three volumes of readable but unreliable autobiography&#151;<span class="italic">Letter to the Past</span> (1982), <span class="italic">Beyond the Blue Mountains</span> (1987), and <span class="italic">Walking through the Valley</span> (1994)&#151;and he became the subject of several studies himself.<br>
<br>Woodcock received many honours and awards, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1968 and a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1971. He refused the honours offered by governments, preferring the respect of his peers. After suffering from heart disease for nearly thirty years, he died at his home, 6429 McCleery Street, Vancouver, on 28 January 1995. His wife survived him.<br>
