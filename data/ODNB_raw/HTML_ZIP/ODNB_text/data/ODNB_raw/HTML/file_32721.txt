<span class="headword">Daubeney, Sir  Henry Charles Barnston</span>  (1810&#150;1903), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Ripon, Yorkshire, on 19 December 1810, was eldest son of Lieutenant-General Henry Daubeney KH, and his first cousin, Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7186/', "Charles Daubeny")</script>, archdeacon of Sarum. After education at Sandhurst he was commissioned ensign in the 55th foot (later 2nd battalion Border regiment) in 1829. He served in it for thirty years, until promoted colonel. In the Coorg campaign, in south India (1832&#150;4), he served with his regiment with the northern column under Colonel Waugh; he was present at the assault of the stockade of Kissenhully, and at the attack on that of Soamwarpettah. There he was in charge of one of the two guns attached to the column, and he saved it from capture during the retreat. The British losses were three officers and forty-five men killed and 118 men wounded, but the raja of Coorg, who was opposing the British advance, was defeated and deposed on 10 April 1834.<br>
<br>Daubeney served with his regiment during the Chinese War of 1841&#150;2, and as a captain commanded the light company at the repulse of the enemy's night attack at Chinhai (Zhenhai), and at the storm and capture of Chapu (Zhapu) (18 May 1842). He was on the staff as major of brigade to Major-General Schoedde at Wusang, Shanghai, and Chinkiang Fu (Zhenjiang fu), and was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted brevet major on 23 December 1842, and was made CB on 24 December 1842.<br>
<br>Daubeney was promoted major (25 November 1845) and went through the Crimean campaign of 1854. On 26 October 1854 he helped to repulse the sortie of the Russians from Sevastopol. At Inkerman, on 5 November 1854, Daubeney, at the head of thirty men of his regiment, made a flank charge; without firing a shot he forced his way through the attacking Russian column, compelling the enemy to fall back in confusion. He was commended in dispatches and was gazetted to a substantive lieutenant-colonelcy on 12 December 1854 for his services at Inkerman, but he declined a promotion which would have removed him from the seat of war and placed him on half pay, while his regiment was serving in the field. General Sir John Pennefather recommended him for the Victoria Cross, but being a regimental field officer he was held to be ineligible. He received the next year the reward for distinguished service, the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and the fourth class of the order of the Mejidiye. From 1858 to 1869 he was inspector of army clothing. Promoted major-general on 6 March 1868 and lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, he was made KCB on 30 May 1871, was appointed colonel of his regiment on 3 February 1879, became general on 4 March 1880, and was made GCB on 24 March 1884.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1880 Daubeney resided at Osterley Lodge, Spring Grove, Isleworth, Middlesex, where he died on 17 January 1903. He was married three times: in 1840, to Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1857), only child of Samuel Davy Liptrap of Southampton, with whom he had two sons; in 1859 to Henrietta Anne (<i>d</i>. 1876), only daughter of Charles Jacomb of Upper Clapton, Middlesex; and in 1878 to Eliza, second daughter of Charles Carpenter of Brunswick Square, Brighton, who survived him.<br>
