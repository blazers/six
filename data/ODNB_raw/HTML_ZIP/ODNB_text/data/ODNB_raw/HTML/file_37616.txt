<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jones,  Thomas Gwynn</span>  (1871&#150;1949), <span class="occ">poet and scholar</span>, was born on 10 October 1871 at Gwyndy-uchaf, Betws-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire, the eldest of the four children of Isaac Jones (1842&#150;1929), farmer, poet, and lay preacher, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts (1845&#150;1896). At birth he was given the name Thomas, but adopted Gwynn as a second name in his early twenties and thereafter went by the name T. Gwynn Jones.<br>
<br>After elementary education in country schools and a little private tuition Gwynn Jones's early attempts to prepare for Oxford entrance came to nought when he fell ill on the eve of the matriculation examination. The autodidact in him overcame this set-back, and when ultimately he obtained a university chair he did so unencumbered by a day spent in a seat of higher learning. Between 1891 and 1909 he was a journalist in north Wales and Liverpool, working mainly for Welsh-language weekly newspapers, including <span class="italic">Baner ac Amserau Cymru</span> in Denbigh and <span class="italic">Yr Herald Cymraeg</span> and <span class="italic">Papur Pawb</span> in Caernarfon. On 8 June 1899 he married Margaret Jane 
    (Megan; 1872&#150;1963)
  , the daughter of Thomas and Anne Davies of Denbigh: they had a daughter and two sons. After wintering in Egypt on medical advice in 1905&#150;6 he returned briefly to journalism until, in 1909, he became a cataloguer at the new National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. In 1913 he was appointed reader in Welsh literature at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and in 1919 was promoted to the Gregynog chair of Welsh literature, remaining in that post until he retired in 1937. Gwynn Jones's late entry to academic life was fostered by supporters such as Sir John Williams, the national library's principal benefactor, and the influential scholar and critic Sir John Morris-Jones, his academic guru.<br>
<br>Gwynn Jones was a prolific writer of exceptional energy and versatility. His scholarly works include an introduction to <span class="italic">Dwyfol g&acirc;n Dante</span>, a translation of Dante's <span class="italic">Divina commedia</span> by Daniel Rees, his sympathetic editor in Caernarfon (1903); &#145;Bardism and romance&#146; (1914); <span class="italic">Llenyddiaeth y Cymry</span> (1915); <span class="italic">Llenyddiaeth Gymraeg y bedwaredd ganrif ar bymtheg</span> (1920); <span class="italic">Gwaith Tudur Aled</span> (2 vols., 1926); and <span class="italic">Welsh Folklore and Folk Custom</span> (1930). He wrote acclaimed biographies of two men who had a profound influence upon him. The first, published in 1912, was of Emrys ap Iwan (the Revd Robert Ambrose Jones), a forthright critic and writer on religious and political matters, who had encouraged him to study early Welsh literature and kindled his interest in European languages. The second biography appeared in 1913, and took as its subject Thomas Gee, owner and campaigning editor of <span class="italic">Baner ac Amserau Cymru</span> in Denbigh and mentor of the young Lloyd George, who had given him his start in journalism.<br>
<br>Gwynn Jones also turned his linguistic and literary gifts to translating works from English, Irish, and languages of mainland Europe. They include <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1902 and 1942), translations from Irish in <span class="italic">Peth nas Lleddir</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">Awen y Gwyddyl</span> (1922), works by Ibsen and von Hofmannsthal, and, notably, <span class="italic">Faust</span> (1922). With H. J. Rose he translated a selection of Greek and Latin epigrams (1927). In 1940 the Gregynog Press published <span class="italic">Visions of the Sleeping Bard</span>, his translation into English of Ellis Wynne's prose masterpiece. During his years in journalism he produced fifteen novels in serial form, of which four subsequently appeared as books, <span class="italic">John Homer</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">Lona</span> (1923) being the best-known. His winter in Egypt provided material for a travel book, <span class="italic">Y M&ocirc;r canoldir a'r Aifft</span> (1912). Collections of his essays appeared in <span class="italic">Traethodau</span> (1910), <span class="italic">Cymeriadau</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Beirniadaeth a Myfyrdod</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Astudiaethau</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Dyddgwaith</span> (1937).<br>
<br>Despite these substantial achievements it is as a poet that Gwynn Jones is remembered by the Welsh people. He was generally recognized as the leading poet of his generation, and is one of the major figures of Welsh poetry from its beginnings to the present day. Part of Gwynn Jones's genius lay in his remarkable complexity&#151;a Romantic who said profound things about the tragedy of his own times; a poet of &#145;pure bitterness&#146; and of lyrical nostalgia; in prosody a conservative and an innovator; a pacifist &#145;with the emphasis on the fist&#146;; a semi-detached believer; a melancholiac with a sense of humour.<br>
<br>The classical diction and economy of medieval Welsh poetry captivated Gwynn Jones, and their imprint is clear in his later work. He was a consummate master of the strict metres and of <i>cynghanedd</i> (alliteration and sometimes internal rhyme in a line of verse). Most of his major poems are dramatic narratives which draw upon Celtic legend, although he adapted the stories freely, grafting on inventions of his own and exploiting their timelessness to relate them to his own day. He came to prominence in 1902 when, still a struggling journalist, he won the first of his two national eisteddfod chairs for his ode &#145;Ymadawiad Arthur&#146; (&#145;The passing of Arthur&#146;), which captured the spirit of an age of national reawakening. There followed a majestic sequence of mythological poems&#151;&#145;Gwlad y bryniau&#146; (1909), &#145;Tir na n'&oacute;g&#146; (1916), &#145;Madog&#146; (1918), &#145;Bros&eacute;l&iacute;&agrave;wnd&#146; (1922), &#145;Anatiomaros&#146; (1925), &#145;Argoed&#146; (1927), and &#145;Cynddilig&#146; (1935)&#151;which chart the transition from his early optimism to bitter disillusionment, a process hastened by his reaction to the First World War and to contemporary cultural and moral disintegration. He devised new metres, dispensing with rhyme but retaining <i>cynghanedd</i> until, finally, metre gave way to <i>vers libre</i>. Although Gwynn Jones saw contradictions in his poems, and said that it was &#145;idle to seek in them either teaching or philosophy&#146;, their recurring themes are the tragedy of simple societies and the personal dilemmas of their heroes under the threat of oppression, and the quest for Arcadia (famously Ynys Afallon in &#145;Ymadawiad Arthur&#146;). They appear in one or more of his six volumes of verse&#151;<span class="italic">Gwlad y g&acirc;n a chaniadau eraill</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Ymadawiad Arthur a chaniadau ereill</span> (1910), <span class="italic">Detholiad o ganiadau</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Manion</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Caniadau</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Y dwymyn</span> (1944). Most of the poems in <span class="italic">Y dwymyn</span>, stark and full of foreboding, first appeared pseudonymously in the 1930s, when their style and content caused a stir. They mark his final weaning from Afallon.<br>
<br>Some have suggested that Gwynn Jones's search for his Afallon led him to an ivory tower far from the social realism found in later poets. But he was no cloistered scholar: his early socialism and years in journalism taught him something of the world, and he had seen what the industrial age had done to traditional society. His poems, he said, were &#145;an attempt to recount experiences&#146;: his Afallon allegorically suggests his condemnation of the unbearable present. The stories, the majestic diction with its archaisms, the effortless mastery of <i>cynghanedd</i>, and the vivid evocation of nature and scenes of human action combine to make some of the most artistically satisfying passages in Welsh literature. But at the same time his symbolism precisely suggests the old world's loss of innocence and the corrosive materialism of the new.<br>
<br>When he retired in 1937 Gwynn Jones was appointed CBE. Both the University of Wales and the National University of Ireland conferred upon him the honorary degree of DLitt. He was granted the medal of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion in 1939, and in 1944 received the traditional tribute of the Welsh people in the form of an illuminated address and generous testimonial. He died at his home, Willow Lawn, at Caradog Road in Aberystwyth, on 7 March 1949, and was buried on 10 March in the town's public cemetery.<br>
