<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hingeston,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1606&#150;1683), <span class="occ">instrumentalist and composer</span>, was born in the parish of St Lawrence, York, the son and one of at least seven children of Thomas Hingeston (<i>d</i>. 1619/20), vicar-choral at York Minster and rector of St Lawrence in the city, and his wife, Dorothy. Through his father he secured a place in the choir at York Minster. The date on which Hingeston became a chorister is unknown, but his name is included among two lists of singing boys recorded in a medius decani partbook in the years 1618 and 1619. On 17 March 1620 he played &#145;upon the organs&#146;  (Chatsworth, Bolton MSS, book 98, fol. 142) in an entertainment given for Emanuel Scrope, lord president of the council in north, by the Yorkshire nobleman Francis Clifford, fourth earl of Cumberland, a &#145;worthy lover and patron of that facultie music&#146;  (W. Byrd, <span class="italic">Psalmes, Songes and Sonnets</span>, 1611). Hingeston joined the Clifford household in 1621 and was formally apprenticed to the earl in August of that year. He was sent to London the following month to study with the organist and composer Orlando Gibbons, whom he later described as &#145;my ever hono'rd Master&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/375, q. 134). Some time before February 1625 Hingeston returned to the Clifford estates at Skipton and Londesborough in Yorkshire, where, in addition to his musical duties, he served as butler and yeoman of the wine cellar. He remained in the family's employment until 1645 when the household was dispersed following the capture of Skipton Castle by parliamentary forces.<br>
<br>Hingeston's career blossomed during the interregnum. In 1651 he was listed in John Playford's <span class="italic">Musicall Banquet</span> as one of nine &#145;excellent and able masters&#146; for the organ and virginal. Shortly after the establishment of the protectorate household in April 1654, he was appointed organist to Oliver Cromwell at a fee of &pound;100 per annum, and was placed in charge of &#145;his Highness Musique&#146;, a band of eight musicians and two apprentices. According to Anthony Wood, Hingeston &#145;breed up two Boyes to sing with himselfe Mr. Dearings printed latine songes for 3 voices [Richard Dering's <span class="italic">Cantica sacra</span>, 1662]; which Oliver was most taken with&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D19/4). Hingeston's concern for the plight of his fellow musicians led him to petition the Council for the Advancement of Musick on 19 February 1657. He sought the incorporation of a college with powers to regulate the practice of music and instrument making, and funding to maintain and encourage professors of the art. His final act as master of Cromwell's music was to head the band of musicians who marched in the protector's funeral procession on 23 November 1658.<br>
<br>Hingeston joined the royal household at the Restoration and was appointed as a violist in the Private Musick and the Chapel Royal, and as keeper of his majesty's wind instruments. He became a member of the Corporation of Musick, holding office as warden (1662&#150;4 and 1674&#150;5) and deputy marshal (February&#150;June 1672). In his will Hingeston mentions two apprentices&#151;his nephew Peter Hingeston, who later became organist of St Mary-le-Tower in Ipswich, and Henry Purcell&#151;and a scholar named John Blagrave. Hingeston died, unmarried, at his home in Great St Anne's Lane, Westminster, between 12 and 17 December 1683, and was buried on 17 December in St Margaret's New Chapel yard beside Stretton Ground. His bequests amounted to about &pound;600 in money, excluding arrears of pay from the royal household, six portraits, including one of Orlando Gibbons which he gave to the music school at Oxford, several stringed instruments, an organ, music books, and various properties.<br>
<br>Hingeston was a prolific composer. His consort music for viols and violins with continuo is mainly preserved in a set of partbooks which he presented to the music school at Oxford between 1661 and 1682  (Bodl. Oxf., MSS Mus. Sch. D.205&#150;11), and in a related autograph organ book acquired by the university some time after the composer's death  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Mus. Sch. E.382). The fantasias and airs for three bass viols  (BL, Add. MS 31436), which probably date from Hingeston's employment in the Private Musick, are unusual in their scoring for three equal instruments. His suites for cornets and sackbuts written for the protectorate court survive in an incomplete set of partbooks bound with the personal coat of arms of Oliver Cromwell  (V&amp;A, Clements TT14&#150;15).<br>
