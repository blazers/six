<span class="headword">Baldwin,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1820), <span class="occ">architect and property developer</span>, of unknown parentage, was mainly active in Bath, although not born there. He married Elizabeth, daughter of John Chapman, alderman of the city, on 15 September 1779, at St James's Church. They had at least one daughter and one son. He began his career as clerk to the Palladian local architect Thomas Warr Atwood, who brought him into the firm as someone familiar with London fashion, able to handle Robert Adam's refined but shallow surface detail. In 1775 Atwood was awarded the contract to build the city's new guildhall, but his sudden death in November that year did not interrupt his clerk's assimilation into the Bath building scene. Over the next eleven months Baldwin's designs, first for the east front, then for the west or entrance front, and finally for a suite of banquet room and council chamber in a style indistinguishable from that of the Adam brothers, were accepted by the council. In the same year, 1776, Baldwin was appointed city architect and surveyor. From this base he mounted a successful practice, executing public works and speculative building on the grandest scale, only halted by his dismissal from his official positions for false accounting and his subsequent bankruptcy in 1796.<br>
<br>Baldwin was master of two related styles. His public buildings were conceived in a robust stylar Palladian, but display the refined ornaments of neo-classicism and command the city centre with both authority and elegance. In 1786 he built the Cross Bath with a north fa&ccedil;ade of subtle serpentine curves and refined neo-classical forms. This confirmed his connection with the city's hot springs: he was made inspector of the baths in 1787 and in 1790 he was ordered to begin the west front of the Great Pump Room with its exquisitely ornamented twin colonnades.<br>
<br>For his speculative housing Baldwin devised shallow elevations which gave an impression of expensive surface detail but were relatively cheap to construct: Northumberland Buildings (<i>c</i>.1788) was his first experiment in this style. After 1788 Baldwin took over the development of the Bathwick estate, a project conceived on the most ambitious scale: Great Pulteney Street alone is 1100 feet long and 100 feet wide, although the thin pilasters and applied pediments of Bathwick's terraces prevent them from ranking alongside the Royal Crescent and the King's Circus as works of European significance. Bath Street, which he was building in the old centre after 1791, is probably his finest work, with sweeping quadrant arms and a covered promenade of Ionic columns. Unfortunately, its creation opened up an unsatisfactory vista to the almost blank east wall of Baldwin's earlier Cross Bath. At the same time suspicions were growing over his handling of council funds. Before his disgrace and dismissal, he had prepared designs for the north front of the Pump Room, overlooking the abbey churchyard. This was to have had a projecting Corinthian portico, but John Palmer who succeeded him, completed the north front with an engaged portico. Palmer also rebuilt the Cross Bath, re-siting the serpentine north fa&ccedil;ade to face east down the new Bath Street.<br>
<br>Baldwin continued to work after his bankruptcy, rebuilding Hafod in Cardiganshire for Thomas Johnes in 1807 and designing the town hall in Devizes, Wiltshire (1806&#150;8). He died at 3 Harington Place, Bath, on 7 March 1820, and was buried in St Michael's Church there.<br>
