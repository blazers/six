<span class="headword">Armitage <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bulley]</span>,  Ella Sophia</span>  (1841&#150;1931), <span class="occ">historian and archaeologist</span>, was born in Mason Street, West Derby, Liverpool, on 3 March 1841, the second daughter in the family of four sons and ten daughters of Samuel Marshall Bulley JP (1811&#150;1880), a cotton broker of Liverpool, and his wife, Mary Rachel (1817&#150;1887), only daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23009/', "Revd Thomas Raffles")</script>, first cousin to Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781&#150;1826). Her siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48686/', "Amy Bulley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96761/', "Arthur Kilpin Bulley")</script>. Educated at home, she in turn taught her younger brothers and sisters, which greatly irked her as it prevented her from pursuing her own studies. As her elder sister, Mary, married young, Ella took on the role of eldest daughter and mother's right hand. However, she vowed to overcome &#145;the accursed thraldom of womanhood&#146; and to cultivate her mind and abilities to the utmost, a promise recorded in code in her 1856 diary, the only one to survive her death. Her commitment to self-education was reflected in her later proficiency in French, German, Italian, and Latin; she could also read Spanish, Norwegian, Danish, Welsh, and Early English. In October 1871 she became one of the first five students at Newnham College, Cambridge, founded by Henry Sidgwick with Anne Clough, a Bulley family friend, in charge. Ella was their first research student. On 30 July 1874 she married the Revd Elkanah Armitage (1844&#150;1929), a Congregationalist minister and one of the fourteen children of William Armitage JP, of the manufacturing firm of Armitage and Rigby. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1877&#150;9 Ella Armitage taught history at the embryo women's department at Owens College, Manchester (later Manchester University). In 1887 she became the first and only woman on the school board at Rotherham, and in 1890 she was elected to the school board at Bradford and the West Riding education committee. In 1894 she was appointed assistant commissioner to the royal commission on secondary education under James Bryce to investigate girls' education in Devon. She worked hard to improve the status of further and higher education for girls, and in her special report to the royal commission on secondary education she did not mince her words in describing the deplorable state of girls' education in Devon's private schools. But she was not involved in the women's suffrage and other similar movements, and preferred to expend her energies within the arena offered by her church. A gifted pianist and musician, she wrote several hymns, and spoke frequently for the London Missionary Society throughout the country. She instituted a women's conference in the Yorkshire Congregationalist Union (1891), formed a women's guild of Christian service, and both spoke and preached in Congregationalist forums; she even wrote one of her husband's sermons.<br>
<br>But Ella Armitage's abiding passions were medieval history and archaeology, which she continued to study all her life. When, in 1884, G. T. Clark (1809&#150;1898) published his <span class="italic">Mediaeval Military Architecture in England</span>, she realized that it contained false assumptions about the origins of the various mounds or mottes scattered over the British Isles. Clark held that many were of Anglo-Saxon origin. Together with J. H. Round, George Neilson in Scotland, and Goddard Orpen in Ireland, Armitage was to prove in a stream of articles and books that motte and bailey castles did not appear in Britain until after the Norman conquest. An important paper was read for her in 1900 to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland by her cousin Gerard Baldwin Brown, and thereafter controversial articles in learned journals culminated in 1912 in the publication by John Murray of <span class="italic">The Early Norman Castles of the British Isles</span>, which is still considered a seminal work on the subject. She also contributed the section on earthworks in the <span class="italic">Victoria History of the County of York</span> in 1912. In 1919 she received an honorary MA from Manchester University for her work in archaeology.<br>
<br>Described in her student days as tall and stately with magnificent hair worn in a plaited coronet, Ella Armitage was serious and slightly forbidding to some, but to family and friends was full of fun, with a deep chuckle when amused. She was sharp and witty in her writings and observations. She died on 20 March 1931 at her daughter's home, Parkhurst, Park Road South, Middlesbrough, just after her ninetieth birthday, with her mental faculties unimpaired to the last. In spite of the lack of recognition given to her for her work in education, her place as the pioneer of castle studies is still firm. As a result of archaeological progress, some of her conclusions have been found to be faulty but Allen Brown's recognition of &#145;her original and seminal work &hellip; a brilliant survey of all the evidence&#146;  (Brown, 234) still stands.<br>
