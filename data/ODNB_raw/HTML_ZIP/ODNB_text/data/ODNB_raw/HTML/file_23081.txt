<span class="headword">Ramsay <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Burnett]</span>,  Edward Bannerman</span>  (1793&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal dean of Edinburgh and author</span>, was the fourth son of Alexander Burnett, advocate sheriff of Kincardineshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Sir Alexander Bannerman of Elsick; he was born at Aberdeen on 31 January 1793. His father (who was the second son of Sir Thomas Burnett, bt, of Leys, and his wife, Catherine Ramsay), after his succession in 1806 to the estates of Balmain and Fasque in Kincardineshire, left to him by his uncle, Sir Alexander Ramsay, assumed for himself and his family the name of Ramsay, was made a baronet by Fox (13 May 1806), resigned his sheriffship, and lived until his death in 1810 at Fasque, the estate later owned by the Gladstones.<br>
<br>Edward Ramsay spent much of his boyhood with his great-uncle, Sir Alexander, who lived on his Yorkshire estate. He was sent to the village school at Halsey after his uncle's death, and in 1806 to the cathedral grammar school at Durham. He completed his education at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1816. In the same year he was ordained to the curacy of Rodden, near Frome in Somerset, and in 1817 became curate also of Buckland Denham in the same county, where the absence of the rector gave him the whole pastoral charge. In the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span> of January 1865 he wrote &#145;Reminiscences of a west of England curacy&#146;, in which he describes his life at this period and his friendship with the Wesleyan Methodists among his parishioners. His favourite studies were botany, architecture, and music. He became an accomplished player on the flute, and had a special admiration for Handel. In 1824 he went to Edinburgh as curate of St George's, York Place, where he remained for two years, and after a year's incumbency of St Paul's, Carrubbers Close, became in 1827 assistant to Bishop Sandford of St John's Church. He succeeded Sandford in 1830, and remained pastor of that congregation until his death.<br>
<br>Ramsay's English education had not made him a less patriotic Scot, but it enlarged his view of Scottish patriotism. He advocated consistently, and at last successfully, the removal of the barriers which separated the Scottish Episcopal from the English church. In 1841 he was appointed by Bishop Terrot dean of Edinburgh, and, having declined Peel's offer of the bishopric of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and at later periods the bishopric of Glasgow and the coadjutor-bishopric of Edinburgh, he became familiarly known in Scotland as &#145;the Dean&#146; or Dean Ramsay. He was a vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and delivered the opening address in 1861. His only other contribution to its <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> was a &#145;Memoir&#146; of Thomas Chalmers, a friend for whose genius he had a high admiration. It was largely due to him that the statue of Chalmers was erected in George Street, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character</span> (1858), which gave Ramsay his widest reputation, had its origin in &#145;Two lectures on some changes in social life and habits&#146;, delivered at Ulbster Hall, Edinburgh, in 1857. It was rewritten and much enlarged in successive editions, of which twenty-one were published during his life; the twenty-second was issued after his death with a notice of his life by Professor Cosmo-Innes. The book has been recognized as the best collection of Scottish stories and one of the best answers to the charge of want of humour frequently made against the Scots. It is composed largely of stories and anecdotes furnished by his own recollection or that of his friends of all classes, supplemented by contributions from ministers of the various Scottish churches and others of his countrymen. Those who heard Ramsay tell Scottish stories maintained that print weakened their flavour, but they were woven together in the <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> in an artless personal narrative, which has a charm of its own. The work did much to establish in the English mind an impression of Scotland being inhabited by pawky characters, revelling in their individuality and eccentricity, and they made Ramsay one of the best-known Scots of his time. In addition to the <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> Ramsay published <span class="italic">A Catechism</span> (1835), at one time much used, and a number of volumes of sermons and lectures, of which <span class="italic">Pulpit Table-Talk</span> (1868) is characteristic.<br>
<br>Ramsay was the principal founder of the Scottish Episcopal Church Society, in 1876 absorbed in the Representative Church Council, a society which improved the still slender emoluments of the clergy of the Episcopal church. In theology his sympathy was with the evangelical rather than the high-church party, and in politics with the liberal Conservatives. He retained through life a warm friendship for W. E. Gladstone, with whom he was associated in the foundation of Trinity College, Glenalmond. But he was not a man of party, and the epithet &#145;unsectarian&#146; might have been invented for him. His links with the clergy of other communions and his open-minded attitude did much to lessen the prejudice with which episcopacy was regarded in Scotland.<br>
<br>Ramsay married, in 1829, Isabella Cochrane, a Canadian, who predeceased him without children. Her nephews and nieces found a home in his house, where his brother, Admiral Sir W. Ramsay, resided after retiring from the navy. Dean Ramsay died in Edinburgh on 27 December 1872. A tablet was placed in St John's Church by his congregation, and an Iona cross in the adjoining burial-ground, facing Princes Street, was erected to his memory by public subscription. Ramsay left an autobiography of his ministry. It was bought by David Douglas at the sale of the effects of H. J. Rollo and was published privately by Douglas, edited by F. M. F. Skene, as <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Scottish Episcopal Ministry</span> (1892).<br>
