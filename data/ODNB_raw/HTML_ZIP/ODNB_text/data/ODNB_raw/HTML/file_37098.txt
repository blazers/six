<span class="headword">Ainslie,  John</span>  (1745&#150;1828), <span class="occ">cartographer and land surveyor</span>, was born on 22 April 1745 in Jedburgh, the younger son and younger child of John Ainslie, druggist in Jedburgh, writer to the signet, and burgess of the burgh. He may have been educated at Jedburgh grammar school and was later apprenticed to Thomas Jefferys, for whom he continued to work thereafter. He was employed by him to survey Bedfordshire with Thomas Donald, Buckinghamshire in 1766 to 1768, and Yorkshire from 1767 to 1770.<br>
<br>After Jefferys's death on 20 November 1771 Ainslie returned home and shortly thereafter made a map of Jedburgh and its environs. This plan was dogged by misfortune, and the loss of the plates on a trip to London was never rectified. Lean times followed, and three years later he was using the backs of sheets of his Jedburgh map to draw a privately commissioned plan. On 27 October 1776 he married Christian, daughter and heiress of Thomas Caverhill of Jedburgh, merchant. Ainslie's mind was still fixed on making large-scale county maps: he proposed to survey Selkirkshire, Fife, and Kinross-shire, Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire, Perthshire, the Lothians, Wigtownshire, Angus, Renfrewshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, and Berwickshire. The surveys of Stirlingshire and of Perthshire were never embarked upon, for want of subscribers, and Berwickshire was surveyed by John Blackadder, Ainslie being responsible only for the engraving; but the other counties were surveyed and a first edition of the resultant maps was published in 1797. A new edition was brought out in 1801.<br>
<br>Ainslie settled in Edinburgh and had premises at St Andrew Street, Parliament Square, Rose Street, South Hanover Street, and latterly at Nicolson Street. From Parliament Square he published on 1 March 1778 a map of eastern Scotland from Moffat to Arbroath. He then published four charts covering the south-west coast from Saltcoats to Whitehaven in Cumberland, before turning to the east coast of Scotland, producing a general chart in 1785 and in May 1786 three separate charts of the same coast. Henceforth, the sheer variety of his cartographic output was impressive. In 1785 alone, not only did he survey and engrave the series of charts mentioned above, but he also made a series of estate plans for Patrick Kerr of Abbotrule (which Kerr failed to pay for), surveyed a line for a canal from the Forth to the Clyde for Robert Whitworth, and engraved several plans for the court of session in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>During 1787 and 1788 Ainslie devoted most of his time to preparing his great map of Scotland. On 1 January 1788 the first of nine sheets was complete. This map was a landmark in the improvement of the outline of Scotland, which was not superseded for twenty years. For the first time the Great Glen is shown as a straight line, and Skye, Mull, and Islay are shown with some degree of accuracy. In 1789&#150;90 he made a book of plans of the earl of Eglinton's estates in Ayrshire (now in the National Archives of Scotland). He then worked again with Whitworth, surveying lines for the Edinburgh to Glasgow canal. With Charles Rennie, the civil engineer, he surveyed the new harbour for Saltcoats and the line for the Glasgow to Ardrossan canal. With the turn of the century Ainslie turned to agricultural improvement, publishing <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Farmer's Pocket Book, Companion and Assistant</span> in 1802 and a <span class="italic">Comprehensive Treatise on Land Surveying</span> in 1812. At the time of his death he had amassed &pound;8976 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. He died on 29 February 1828 at his house in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh; he had lived since 1804 at various addresses on that street. He was buried in the south transept of Jedburgh Abbey.<br>
