<span class="headword">Barclay,  Robert</span>  (1611/12&#150;1682), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and college head</span>, was born probably in Kincardineshire, the youngest of the four sons of David Barclay (1580&#150;1660) of Mathers and Elizabeth Livingston, daughter of Sir John Livingston of Dunnipace. He graduated MA from Aberdeen University in 1633. After conversion to Roman Catholicism, Barclay studied at the Scots College, Paris, and the College of St Nicolas du Chardonnet. He was probably one of the group of students from the former who mustered at the Paris residence of John Clerk of Penicuik in 1638 to protest that Clerk had called them all beggars and poor men's sons. After ordination to the priesthood he taught in St Nicolas du Chardonnet for six years and became prefect of studies in the Scots College, Paris. In 1650 he was one of a group of Scottish priests involved in negotiations with the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in Rome which led to the establishment of a prefecture apostolic in Scotland, and he was appointed agent in Paris for the secular clergy.<br>
<br>Barclay became principal of the Scots College, Paris, about 1655. He restored the discipline of the college, and provided it with a grand new building which was ready for use in 1665, and to which a chapel and north wing were added in 1672. In addition, he purchased several properties in Paris which yielded rents for the benefit of the college. Some critics said that he built for his own glory. The indications are that Barclay was a stern disciplinarian and that he was inclined to quarrel. He had many wrangles with the Jesuits in Paris, mainly on account of their attempts to wean his ecclesiastical students into their own order. By stringent measures, such as forbidding his students to visit the Jesuit college, he was often successful in dissuading students from taking such a course, but failed in the case of his own kinsman, John Strachan, who joined the Jesuits at Naples. The principal also failed to convert permanently to Catholicism his nephew and namesake who became the famous Quaker apologist. There were also tensions between Barclay and two priests who had been educated in Rome, William Leslie, the Scots agent in Rome, and Alexander Dunbar, prefect of the Scottish mission. Nevertheless Barclay was successful in producing fine priests, and his students included Thomas Placid Fleming, later abbot of Regensburg, Louis Innes, Thomas Innes, Richard Augustine Hay, and Robert Munro, the intrepid missionary martyr.<br>
<br>Barclay also helped to get Irish missionaries for the Scottish mission, and took part in the missionary conferences in Paris that were organized by the Vincentians. During Barclay's time the college in Paris became a pastoral training centre for Scottish priests who had been trained in Rome. Barclay also gave refuge to priests who were exiled from Scotland for religious reasons, including John Walker and William Ballantine, prefect apostolic of the Scottish mission, both of whom wrote religious works in their sojourn at the college. Robert Barclay died on 7 February 1682, and was buried in the college chapel.<br>
