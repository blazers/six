<span class="headword">Lewkowitsch,  Julius</span>  (1857&#150;1913), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 4 September 1857 at Ostrowo in Silesia. His father was Moritz Lewkowitsch, described as a general merchant. Julius studied chemistry at the University of Breslau, obtaining his PhD in 1879. During his time as a student, he supported himself and paid the expenses of his university education by undertaking private teaching. After graduation, he settled on an academic career of research and teaching in pure chemistry, first under Professor Victor von Richter at Breslau. Then he took a post under Professor Hans Landolt in the chemistry laboratory of the agricultural high school in Berlin. From there he moved to the University of Heidelberg, where he became assistant to Professor Victor von Meyer.<br>
<br>Had Lewkowitsch continued his academic career he would undoubtedly have achieved an eminent position, but in his late twenties he decided on a complete change of direction, into chemical technology. He first worked in the coal tar distilling industry, but at the age of thirty emigrated to England and turned to the soap industry, becoming a chemist and technical manager at Joseph Watson &amp; Sons in Leeds. In 1895 he set up as a consulting chemist in Manchester, later moving to London. He became a naturalized British subject, and on 5 May 1902, at Hampstead register office, London, he married Katherine Julia Morris.<br>
<br>With his shift from pure to applied chemistry, Lewkowitsch embarked on the work that was to make him famous, the chemical technology of vegetable and animal oils, fats, and waxes. The development of this branch of the chemical industry owed much to his careful and thorough investigations, and at the time of his death <span class="italic">The Times</span> hailed him as the leading authority in this field. In 1895 he published the first edition of his monumental <span class="italic">Chemical Technology and Analysis of Oils, Fats and Waxes</span> in one volume. The work grew with successive editions and by the time the fifth edition appeared in 1913 it had expanded to three volumes. The final edition was brought out by his assistant in 1921. In addition the work was published in French and German.<br>
<br>Lewkowitsch was robust physically and intellectually and in spite of his investigative work and a busy consultancy, he placed his great knowledge and linguistic talents freely at the disposal of professional colleagues. He served on the councils of the Chemical Society and the Society of Chemical Industry, of which he was also a vice-president. He played an active part in several meetings of the International Union of Applied Chemistry.<br>
<br>Lewkowitsch was a keen mountaineer and possessed an intimate knowledge of the Alps. It was while on holiday at Chamonix that he contracted an acute respiratory infection; he died there after a short illness on 16 September 1913. He was survived by his widow, a son, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Apart from his published work consisting of his great treatise and scientific papers in several learned journals, listed in Poggendorf, Lewkowitsch left copious manuscript notes recording the development of his technological ideas. These are preserved in the library of Dr Carter Litchfield in the USA. A curious feature of these notes is that there are sentences in which English and German expressions are intermingled.<br>
