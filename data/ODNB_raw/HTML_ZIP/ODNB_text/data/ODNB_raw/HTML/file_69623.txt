<span class="headword">Freney,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1788), <span class="occ">highwayman and burglar</span>, was born in Inistiogue, co. Kilkenny, the son of John Freney, a servant and bailiff, and Alice Phelon, a servant. He was educated privately. He married some time after 1742, and using his wife's dowry he set up a public house in Waterford city. When this failed he took to highway robbery and housebreaking in Kilkenny and adjoining counties. Southern Kilkenny was one of the most lawless areas in eighteenth-century Ireland, and Freney took up with the survivors of a previous criminal group, the Kellymount Gang. Nicknamed Captain Freney, his criminal career lasted from 1745 to 1749, its length possibly due to a certain amount of protection from some of the gentry of Kilkenny with whom he remained on good terms. His crimes and pursuit were reported in the Dublin press, and he was proclaimed an outlaw in June 1747, with a reward of &pound;100 for his capture. A further reward was offered at the Kilkenny assizes in July 1748. He was eventually captured and sentenced to be hanged at the Wexford assizes in August 1749 for breaking and entering the house of Thomas Palliser in Portobello, co. Wexford, in 1747. The sentence was not carried out as Freney turned king's evidence and testified against most of his associates in return for his freedom.<br>
<br>Freney's fame is due to his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of James Freney, Written by Himself</span>, which was first published in Dublin in 1754 with a list of subscribers including the earl of Carrick and Richard Baldwin, the provost of Trinity College, Dublin. It is a somewhat fictionalized account, adding some episodes of heroism and chivalry to otherwise technical descriptions of housebreaking and disposal of stolen goods, and it later achieved enormous popularity in chapbook form. In 1766 Freney was appointed a tidewaiter in New Ross, co. Wexford, and he held this position until his death in 1788.<br>
