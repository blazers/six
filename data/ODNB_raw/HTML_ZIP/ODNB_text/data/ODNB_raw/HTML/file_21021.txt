<span class="headword">Owen,  Lewis</span>  (1571/2&#150;1633?), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and spy</span>, born in Merioneth, was probably the eldest son of Gruffydd Owen, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21020/', "Lewis Owen (1522?&#150;1555)")</script> of Caernarfon, a baron of the exchequer. On 4 December 1590 he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, at the age of eighteen, but later left the university without graduating. Anthony Wood learned that he had &#145;some petty employment bestowed on him about that time&#146;, which from his later writings seems to have been that of an observer in Spanish territories during the Anglo-Spanish war. Wood speculated mistakenly that Owen entered the Jesuit order at Valladolid and remained as &#145;a curious observer among them for some time&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.545). However, he was never a registered student at the college of St Alban in Valladolid, and his name does not appear in the catalogues of the members of the Society of Jesus. He must be distinguished from the Lewis Owen who served in 1596 at Whitehall as &#145;Her Majesty's servant in the Privy Larder&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 185) and as a lawyer, was granted a wardship in 1604, and in 1607 with others was awarded a grant in fee-farm of a tithe in Alton, Staffordshire.<br>
<br>Owen was in London by 1605 when he published <span class="italic">A Key of the Spanish Tongue, or, A Plaine and Easie Introduction &hellip;</span> that was dedicated to three friends from Merioneth: Sir Roger Owen, Sir Thomas Myddleton, and John Lloyd of the Inner Temple. He called it &#145;a little pamphlet&#146;, written &#145;at some vacant houres in the kingdome of Castile&#146;, that taught pronunciation and grammar, and provided a list of frequent phrases and four sample dialogues in English and Spanish for practice. Owen's travels also gave him skills in French, for in 1609 he published a translation of a tract by the protestant Morton Eudes, entitled <span class="italic">Catholique Traditions: a Treatise of the Beliefs of Christians &hellip;</span>. In his dedication to Prince Henry, Owen praised his &#145;learned father&#146;, King James, who ended divisions &#145;which the overscruple of some and the too much libertie of others had brought into the church of England&#146;. Eudes described six different Christian churches: the Eastern (or Orthodox), the Nestorian, the Coptic, the Armenian, the Latin (or Catholic), and the protestant, and then gave each church's theological position on forty-four current controversies, such as the authority of the apostle Peter and the signs of a &#145;true church&#146;. Eudes gave a brief summary of the teaching of each side, and then his &#145;Annotation&#146; offered the wiser teaching, which for him was rarely that of the Latin church.<br>
<br>After he had arranged a second printing of this book, Owen recalled later that &#145;In the yeare 1610 I was sent by &hellip; a privy counceller in this land to Rome to learne &hellip; what the Earle of Tyrone did intend to do&#146;  (Owen, <span class="italic">Running Register</span>, 41). In May 1614 he informed Sir Ralph Winwood, secretary of state, of his return to London, &#145;sick and poor after spending many years abroad for his country's service&#146;, and of his readiness for new tasks when he reached Brussels  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1611&#150;18</i>, 236). Little is known about his itinerary in Winwood's service after 1615, but from the contents of his writings after 1625 it is clear that Owen's religious viewpoint had changed from that of the moderate Anglican in 1609 to that of the crusading puritan who was determined to reveal to the English the menace of Catholic religious orders. His major work, <span class="italic">The Unmasking of All Popish Monks, Friers and Jesuits</span>, printed in 1628 and dedicated to Sir John Lloyd, who had been a patron for his Spanish grammar, highlighted the role of religious orders in propping up &#145;the tottering kingdom&#146; of the &#145;Romish Anti-Christ&#146;. He identified numerous foundations by name and then reviewed their growth and current activities on the continent. He had scurrilous anecdotes in abundance and factual errors in several instances, as well as blanket condemnations, such as that monks and nuns only sought &#145;the pompe, pride and glory of the world&#146;  (p. 152). He reported meeting a fellow Welshman, &#145;Master Floyd&#146;, who was dismissed by the Jesuits &#145;because he was not wicked enough&#146;  (p. 129). He warned that in London there were &#145;cunning Jebusites&#146; who &#145;paid the gold of the King of Spaine&#146; to &#145;his pensioners that lurke about the court of England&#146;  (p. 159), regardless of the Anglo-Spanish war. He was certain that Jesuits were &#145;the cause of all these wars, bloodshed, commotions, Dearth, Famine, Persecutions&#146; in Europe  (p. 122).<br>
<br>Owen's near paranoia about the Jesuits required a second book, which in its first printing of 1626 was entitled <span class="italic">The running register, &hellip; a true relation of the English colledges, seminaries and cloysters &hellip;</span>. On page 56 of this <span class="italic">Register</span> he advised those who wished to learn more about life in a Jesuit college to read his recent book <span class="italic">The Unmasking</span>, which implied that it had been completed in manuscript first. The <span class="italic">Register</span> began with a 47-page essay, &#145;Ignatius his progresse&#146;, which was a disparaging commentary on Pedro de Ribadeneyra's biography of Loyola printed in 1604. There followed his listing of the locations of all &#145;the colleges or religious houses in Europe&#146; of the Jesuits, but he warned that they were &#145;so insatiable in their covetousnesse that were they never so riche yet they thinke they have never enough&#146;  (p. 58). In 1629 the <span class="italic">Register</span> was reprinted in its entirety under a new title: <span class="italic">Speculum Jesuiticum, or, The Jesuites looking glasse, wherein they may behold Ignatius (their patron), his progresse, their owne pilgrimage, etc. by L.O.</span> This was dedicated to Sir Henry Marten, a judge of the high court of admiralty, since Owen claimed that he had to have protection after he had been warned not to speak the truth, for he was well aware &#145;how strongly these Romish locusts are back't and countenanced &hellip; by great personages&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1628 Owen had informed the privy council that he was suspicious of the conduct of a Christopher Mallory, whom he had seen studying closely the ordnance defending the Tower Wharf, possibly for the French naval forces. Furthermore, Mallory was known to be seeking funds for &#145;the Carthusian cloisters at Mechlin and Nieuport&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1628&#150;9</i>, 255, 328). The council began further inquiries, but Owen's subsequent activities are unknown. In frustration Anthony Wood commented: &#145;This Lewis Owen, who had a rambling head, was living in sixteen hundred twenty nine but what became of him afterwards, I cannot find&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.545). It is reported that he inherited from his mother's brother, William David Lloyd, an estate at Peniarth, Merioneth, where he died in 1633, leaving two daughters.<br>
