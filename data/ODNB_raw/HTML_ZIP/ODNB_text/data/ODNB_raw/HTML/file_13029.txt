<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1594, <em>d.</em> 1673), <span class="occ">master of the revels</span>, was baptized on 7 July 1594 at St Nicholas's Church, Montgomery, the sixth of seven sons (and three daughters) of Richard Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1596) and Magdalen or Magdalene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Newport (<i>d</i>. 1627), of Montgomery. The family were Anglo-Welsh gentry, connected to the Herbert earls of Pembroke. Herbert's mother was later patron of John Donne, and two of his brothers were notable poets: the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13020/', "Edward Herbert (later Lord Herbert of Cherbury)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13025/', "George Herbert")</script>. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13048/', "Thomas Herbert")</script> was a naval officer.<h2>
<a name="Educationanddiplomaticcareer"></a>Education and diplomatic career</h2>Magdalene moved to Oxford in 1599 to supervise the education of her sons (there is no record of Henry attending school or university, and he was probably privately tutored), and to London in 1601, taking a house in Drury Lane. In 1609 she married the much younger Sir John Danvers, who took an interest in his stepchildren.<br>
<br>By 1615 Herbert was in France, acquiring a command of the language and acting as a diplomatic courier. In April 1619 he was sent to Paris to prepare for his brother Edward's appointment as British ambassador, and was involved in important business, including abortive negotiations for the marriage of Prince Charles to the Princess Henrietta Maria. He began to be noticed at court and determined to make a separate career for himself; in March 1622 he became a gentleman of the privy chamber, a largely ceremonial post, but with some access to the king. When Edward returned to Paris, Henry did not go with him, but continued to act as his agent from London. In his autobiography Edward noted that the whole family was prone to be passionately angry and quarrelsome, &#145;infirmities to which all our Race is subject&#146;, and that Henry (who acted as second when Sir Robert Vaughan challenged Edward to a duel in 1619) &#145;gave several proofs of his courage in duels, and otherwise being no less dexterous in the ways of the court as having gotten much by it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, ed. Shuttleworth, 9).<h2>
<a name="Masteroftherevels"></a>Master of the revels</h2>On 24 July 1623 Henry Herbert came to a business understanding with Sir John Astley, the master of the revels. Technically Astley appointed him as his deputy but for practical purposes he sold Herbert the post in return for &pound;150 per annum. Herbert enjoyed the full dignity of the office from the outset, but had Astley died before Ben Jonson, who held the next reversion, he would have lost it. In fact Jonson died in 1637, and Astley in 1640; only then did Herbert's own reversion (acquired jointly with Simon Thelwall in 1629) become operative. The revels office was primarily responsible for overseeing theatrical entertainment at court, mainly hiring in the leading acting companies in the festive season between November and Lent and on other special occasions. It also attended to some practical aspects of court masques, especially the lighting.<br>
<br>Earlier masters of the revels had also carried a special commission, which gave them wide-ranging powers over the acting community. In fact, Herbert never received this commission, presumably because of his arrangement with Astley, which may explain why he had such difficulty reasserting this authority after the Restoration. But prior to the civil war he behaved as if he had, controlling the major acting companies (usually four in number) privileged to perform in London and at court. He also licensed touring players, at least in principle throughout the country, and all manner of other entertainments&#151;exotic animals, puppet shows, &#145;monsters&#146; (people with malformations, including Siamese twins, bearded ladies, children with multiple heads, or no arms), and so on. Most important, from the perspective of later ages, this involved him in the censorship and licensing of all plays, both for performance and for print. Since few records of his principal predecessors, Edmund Tilney and Sir George Buck, have survived, his office records comprise by far the most revealing documents we possess about the censorship of late Elizabethan and early Stuart plays. Neglected for many years after his death, they have now disappeared. But partial transcripts were made by Edmond Malone, George Chalmers, Rebecca Warner, and Craven Ord, and passed into print by various means. The tale of these documents and their transmission is best told in N. W. Bawcutt's authoritative edition of 1996.<h2>
<a name="Herbertsworkandwisdom"></a>Herbert's work and wisdom</h2>On 7 August 1623 King James knighted Herbert and &#145;was pleased likewise to bestow many good words upon me &amp; to receive mee as M.r of his Revells&#146;  (<span class="italic">Control and Censorship</span>, 4&#150;5). This was at Wilton, home of William, earl of Pembroke, lord chamberlain and Herbert's kinsman and patron; Pembroke's involvement prompts speculation that the arrangement with Astley was not purely a commercial business, and may have been related to wider accommodations at court. But the evidence is inconclusive. Herbert certainly took up office, however, when the political situation was unusually fraught. The unprecedented influence of the duke of Buckingham and a proposed marriage between Prince Charles and the Spanish infanta were both highly contentious issues. Something of this doubtless affected his view, for example, of Thomas Drue's <span class="italic">The Duchess of Suffolk</span>, which &#145;being full of dangerous matter was much reformed&#146; before he licensed it in January 1624  (ibid., 148). Conversely, he licensed Thomas Middleton's <span class="italic">A Game at Chess</span> on 12 June despite its transparent discussion of the Spanish match, presumably because it accorded with official policy at the time; the privy council suggested that he should account for this, when the play was an unprecedented success and the Spanish ambassador protested to the king  (ibid., 154). We do not know if Herbert was actually called to account, but Pembroke played a lord chamberlain's part in smoothing matters over, ensuring that the actors suffered no more than a brief suspension of business. The King's Men again exploited anti-Spanish sentiment in December with <span class="italic">The Spanish Viceroy</span>, circumventing Herbert's authority by failing to license the play at all. He was furious, and got the principal members of the company to admit their fault in writing.<br>
<br>These were exceptional incidents in what was normally a cordial relationship of mutual self-interest between the actors and the masters of the revels. More typical was Herbert's decision to &#145;allow&#146; <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> for the King's Men, without even a fee, on the word of the actor John Heminge &#145;that there was nothing profane added or reformed&#146; even though the copy licensed by Buck was missing  (<span class="italic">Control and Censorship</span>, 142). They relied upon Herbert's licence to be allowed to perform and for a form of copyright over their plays; he relied upon their commercial success for quality drama at court and for a steady income. In the early years Herbert earned a pound for each play he licensed for the stage, and 10<i>s</i>. for a licence to print; the sums later doubled. He also received fees for licensing the companies and their theatres, for waiving restrictions on playing in Lent, and at various times the proceeds of benefit performances, or flat rate payments in lieu of these, or presents such as books. From the court he was due an allowance for each day or night in attendance, and an annual allowance of &pound;50 for rent and lodging, though some of this went to house the revels office. His office probably earned him overall at least twice what he was paying Astley every year. By the 1630s, moreover, he had shares in four of the theatres, and in the Restoration claimed these had brought him &pound;400 per annum. The extensive property we know Herbert owned establishes that he was a wealthy man at the height of his career.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1625 Herbert married Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Slyford (<i>d</i>. 1649/50), widow of Edmond Plumer, who had bequeathed her significant land and property, especially in Woodford, Essex, and &pound;5000 in cash. They settled in Woodford, where their three children were born: William (May 1626) and the daughters Vere (August 1627) and Frances (1628). In 1627 they bought what was to be their principal property, Ribbesford, a country manor house in Worcestershire. Herbert carried a bannerol in the funeral procession of King James in 1625, and the following year was elected MP for Montgomery. His brother George was seriously ill at this time and lived for a year at Woodford, apparently on good terms. The brothers shared an interest in restoring churches, Henry making a number of gifts to Ribbesford and helping George with Leighton in Huntingdonshire. Another houseguest (1633) was Richard Baxter, later a noted preacher, then aged eighteen. Correspondence shows Herbert attached to a web of patronage and influence, including Philip, earl of Pembroke (who succeeded his brother as lord chamberlain in 1626) and John, Viscount Scudamore, to whom Herbert sent regular newsletters between 1624 and 1671.<br>
<br>Isaac Walton observed that Herbert's place as master of the revels &#145;required a diligent wisdom with which God hath blessed him&#146;  (Walton, 262). This was tested to the full in the 1630s. He briefly experimented with licensing non-theatrical works, for one of which (Donne's, <span class="italic">Paradoxes</span>) he had to answer in November 1632 before the court of Star Chamber. At about that time Jonson's play <span class="italic">The Magnetic Lady</span> was investigated by the court of high commission; the King's Men argued that they had only performed what Herbert allowed. The issue was not resolved until October 1633, when &#145;the players &hellip; did mee right in my care to purge their plays of all offence, my lords Grace of Canterbury [that is, Archbishop Laud] bestowed many words upon mee, and discharged mee of any blame&#146;  (<span class="italic">Control and Censorship</span>, 184). In the same week Herbert had another altercation with that company over their revival of an old play, <span class="italic">The Tamer Tamed</span>. Such revivals were normally permitted without hindrance if the &#145;allowed&#146; text was unchanged. Here he stopped the performance at short notice, and insisted henceforth that old plays must be relicensed, for which he would charge a half-fee. This &#145;raysed some discourse in the players, thogh no disobedience&#146;  (ibid., 182). A number of his entries in his office-book from this time are unusually, perhaps prudentially, detailed. Two instances involved King Charles himself. In January 1634 Davenant objected that Herbert had dealt over-zealously with profanities in his play, <span class="italic">The Wits</span>, and the king was &#145;pleasd to take <i>faith, death, slight</i>, for asseverations, and no oaths, to which I doe humbly submit as my masters judgement&#146;; but in June 1638 Charles ruled that a passage in a play by Massinger was &#145;too insolent, and to bee changed&#146;  (ibid., 186, 204).<h2>
<a name="Theroyalist"></a>The royalist</h2>Herbert was a royalist, but not as uncritical as some accounts suggest; assertions that he fought for the king are based on misidentifications. In 1639 he joined the king's entourage at Berwick in the expedition against the Scots, but commented on the incompetence and over-confidence of his army. In 1640 he was elected MP for Bewdley in both the Short and Long parliaments, being involved in deliberations over several disputed elections, and coming to blows with the parliamentarian lawyer Serjeant (John) Wilde. In 1642 he was one of the royalists debarred from the Commons, and in August wrote in his office-book: &#145;Here ended my allowance of plaies, for the war began&#146;  (<span class="italic">Control and Censorship</span>, 211). The following year he joined the king's parliament at Oxford. From the beginning, however, he was concerned about the consequences for his estates, which were sequestrated, and his plate, which was later seized. He took deep offence when his brother, Edward, refused to keep his horses safe in Montgomery Castle. By late 1645 he began negotiations to come to terms with parliament, taking the solemn league and covenant in February of the following year, and the negative oath that August. In March 1648 the Commons agreed to accept &pound;1330 10<i>s</i>. as a third of his property, to pardon his delinquency and remove the sequestration of his estate.<br>
<br>By November Herbert's son William and daughter Frances were both dead; Lady Herbert died, and was buried at St Mary Bothaw in London on 5 January 1650. Relations with his surviving daughter, Vere, were soured by a chancery suit taken out against Herbert to recover money entrusted by his mother to Sir John Danvers for her dowry. A year after the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1698), daughter of Sir Robert Offley of Dalby in Leicestershire, thereby linking with the family of the diarist John Evelyn. They had seven children, of whom only three survived their father. These included the elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13031/', "Henry Herbert")</script>, who in 1694 was created Lord Herbert of Cherbury.<br>
<br>During the interregnum Herbert lived quietly in London and on his estates. On the restoration of Charles II he resumed some of his former offices, being sworn in as a gentleman of the privy chamber on 31 May 1660 and master of the revels on 20 June. But he never re-established his old authority. Most critically Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant persuaded the king to give them a monopoly of London playing; that August Charles granted licences authorizing each to erect a theatre in London, create an acting company and license their own plays, without reference to Herbert. He went to law to assert his rights, and two years of litigation, negotiation, and arbitration ensued. He finally came to accommodations with both men, under which he was to license and censor plays but have no other influence in London theatrical affairs. His authority to license plays for the press also seems to have been curtailed. Even his authority outside London was not unchallenged. The mayor of Maidstone (9 October 1660) denied his right to license actors in the provinces, and officials in Norwich later also resisted his authority. Some travelling actors and other entertainers simply ignored his office, despite his efforts to prosecute them. As a result, when he deputized Edward Hayward in 1663 and the flamboyant John Poyntz joined the revels office under a pre-war agreement, there was insufficient income for either of them. They were dismissed in 1665. Yet Herbert himself retained considerable holdings in land and property, and remained active in business affairs.<br>
<br>Herbert was returned to parliament for Bewdley in May 1661 and served for the remainder of his life. In 1665 he prepared his brother Edward's poems for the press. His own translation of two parts of Jean de Silhon's <span class="italic">The Minister of State</span>, a treatise on the principles of statesmanship, appeared in 1658 and 1663. Other works by Herbert, including two series of prose meditations, <span class="italic">The Broken Heart</span> (1620/21, Bodl. Oxf., MS Don. fol. 26) and <span class="italic">Herberts Golden Harpe</span> (1624, Bodl. Oxf., MS Don. fol. 27 and Huntingdon MS HM 85), and a verse play, <span class="italic">The Emperor Otho</span> (NL Wales, MS 5302B), have never been printed but survive in manuscript. Herbert was still actively engaged in business affairs until a month or so before his death (probably at his home in James Street, Covent Garden) on 27 April 1673; he was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 6 May. Elizabeth survived her husband by twenty-five years, dying on 7 July 1698.<br>
