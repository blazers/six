<span class="headword">Holland, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (1788&#150;1873), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 27 October 1788 at Knutsford, Cheshire, the son of Peter Holland (1766&#150;1855), physician, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willits (1766&#150;1803). He was related to Josiah Wedgwood, a keen patron of the arts, and to the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell. At Newcastle upon Tyne Holland was tutored by the Revd William Turner, from whom he acquired a love of natural science and travel. In 1803 he was sent to Dr John Prior Estlin's school in Bristol. As he records in <span class="italic">Recollections of Past Life</span> his &#145;most intimate friend [there] was Richard Bright &hellip; who as Dr. Bright held such a high and well-merited place in the medical world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 11). The boys shared the same keen interest in science and geology. On leaving Estlin's school Holland walked the entire distance home to Knutsford, a precursor perhaps to his later obsession with adventure and travel. This probably led to his decision to follow a career in business which he believed would provide him with opportunity for travel; to this end he became an articled clerk with a major Liverpool merchant house. A family connection with the senior partner gave Holland the opportunity to enrol for two sessions at Glasgow University in 1804 and 1805 which in his own words &#145;virtually decided the course of my future life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 17). He was released from his articles and in 1806 embarked on a medical degree at Edinburgh. He also spent two winters at the United Hospitals of Guy's and St Thomas's in London. In 1810 his spirit of adventure was gratified by an expedition to Iceland in company with Sir George Mackenzie of Coul and Richard Bright. His study of the diseases of the Icelanders provided data for his doctoral thesis &#145;De morbis Islandiae&#146; with which he graduated in 1811; it was dedicated to Bishop Geir Vidalin of Iceland. He contributed his accounts &#145;History and literature of Iceland&#146; and &#145;Diseases of the Icelanders&#146; to Mackenzie's <span class="italic">Travels in the Island of Iceland</span> (1811). Holland nearly lost his life when he and Bright made an abortive attempt to reach the summit of Snaefell Jokul. When retracing their steps Holland was the second to cross a precarious snow bridge; his foot broke through the ice and he just managed to save himself from being plunged into the deep chasm below. As he wrote in his journal this was not accomplished &#145;without much fear and trembling whilst thus hazardously engaged!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Iceland Journal</span>, 195).<br>
<br>Having graduated Holland spent the next eighteen months travelling in Portugal, Gibraltar, Sardinia, Sicily, the Ionian Isles, and Greece. The publication in 1814 of an account of the eastern part of this journey, <span class="italic">Travels in the Ionian Isles, Albania, Thessaly, Macedonia etc. during 1812 and 1813</span>, provided him with an entr&eacute;e to London society which would be of great benefit in a medical career which he determined would allow him to devote two months of every year to travel. In 1814 he again visited Europe, this time as medical attendant to the princess of Wales (later Queen Caroline). He was subsequently asked to testify at the inquiry of 1820 which sought the necessary evidence to divorce her from George IV.<br>
<br>Holland was made a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 8 April 1816, and fellow in 1828. He commenced his professional life in 1816 in a fashionable practice at his home in Mount Street, London. Four years later he moved to Lower Brook Street where he lived until his death. Holland gave the Goulstonian lecture at the college in 1830 and served in numerous years as censor or consiliarius. He neither sought, nor apparently needed, a hospital appointment to further his career. He moved freely in society circles and his advice was much respected, albeit that a practised bedside manner was rather more in evidence than hard medical insight. At the end of the London season he visited the popular resort of Spa which further cemented his growing clientele of the rich and famous and allowed him to maintain his resolve to limit his professional work to that which afforded him an income of &pound;5000 and gave him the freedom to pursue his great love of travel. In his lifetime he visited every European capital, made two visits to Iceland, and eight to America, covering more than 26,000 miles of that continent. The exploration of rivers afforded him particular pleasure:<blockquote>watching the flow of waters which come from unknown springs or find their issue in some remote ocean or sea. I have felt this on the Nile at its time of highest inundation, when crossing the Volga when scarcely wider than the Thames at Oxford and still more when near the sources of the streams that feed the Euphrates, south of Trebizond. (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 25)</blockquote>On the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 Holland was appointed physician-extraordinary, and in 1840 he became physician-in-ordinary to the prince consort. He declined the offer of a baronetcy made by Lord Melbourne in 1841 but happily accepted the offer in 1853. He received an honorary DCL from the University of Oxford and also from the University of Harvard, Massachusetts. As president of the Royal Institution Holland strove to popularize science by promoting the lectures to the &eacute;lite of the fashionable circles in which he moved. He keenly supported the efforts of Faraday and Tyndall to improve the society and also set up the Holland Fund to which he contributed &pound;40 each year for the promotion of scientific research. His <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (1868; 4th edn, 1873) not only provide interesting accounts of his travels but also record the diversity of leading figures of the times with whom he could boast intimacy. His Edinburgh days had brought him into contact with men such as Lord Brougham, Sydney Smith, and Francis Corner, while in London he was a frequenter of the soir&eacute;es at Holland House and was acquainted with figures from the literary world such as Madame de Sta&euml;l, Maria Edgeworth, and Joanna Baillie.<br>
<br>While Holland could not be described as a great physician, his medical text <span class="italic">Medical Notes and Reflections</span> (1839) is of some interest in its attempt to expose the relationship between mind and body. The book comprises several discrete essays on subjects relating to the philosophy and practice of medicine. The parts relating specifically to mental philosophy were published in 1851 in one volume entitled <span class="italic">Chapters on Mental Physiology</span>.<br>
<br>Holland was twice married, first in 1822 to Margaret Emma (1792&#150;1830), daughter of James Caldwell of Linley Wood, Staffordshire. She died on 2 February 1830 leaving two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33940/', "Henry Thurstan Holland")</script>, created Lord Knutsford in 1888, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48702/', "Francis James Holland")</script>, canon of Canterbury, and two daughters. In 1834 he married Saba (1802&#150;1866), daughter of the Revd Sydney Smith; the couple had three daughters. Holland very determinedly carved out for himself exactly the life he wanted. Spare of stature but blessed with exceptionally good health, he was able to indulge his abiding love of travel right up to the time of his death. In the autumn of 1873 he journeyed with his son Francis from Nizhniy Novgorod in Russia to southern Italy. He returned to London on 25 October feeling somewhat unwell and gradually lost the power of speech over that weekend. He died peacefully at his home, 72 Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, on 27 October 1873.<br>
