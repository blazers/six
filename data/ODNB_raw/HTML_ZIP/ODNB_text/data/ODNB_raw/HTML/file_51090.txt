<span class="headword">Whetstone, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1630/31&#150;1668?), <span class="occ">naval officer and adventurer</span>, was the eldest son of Roger Whetstone (<i>d</i>. before 1656), a professional soldier, and Catherine Cromwell (<i>bap</i>. 1597), favourite sister of the protector. Whetstone was born abroad, probably in the Netherlands where his father served, and naturalized by act of parliament in 1656. He owed his rise wholly to the protector's misplaced patronage. He first appears as a volunteer serving on Penn's flagship in the expedition to Hispaniola in 1654, and Penn soon yielded to Cromwell's pressure by promoting him lieutenant. On the homeward voyage in 1655 Whetstone was advanced to command the <i>Golden Cock</i>. Despite his lack of experience he was then rapidly advanced to the fourth-rate <i>Phoenix</i> in 1656 and the third-rate <i>Fairfax</i> in October 1657, and further distinguished by being chosen to carry English diplomats abroad. He joined the fleet under Stokes at Lisbon late in 1657, and after it moved into the Mediterranean in late December Stokes made him commander of a squadron plying between Malta and Candia (Crete). The results were disastrous: Whetstone flouted orders, and sold for his own use a prize carrying grain desperately needed by the fleet. In exasperation Stokes revoked his command, whereupon Whetstone deserted his force and sailed for Algiers. He was still able to rely on his connections at home, however, and when Stokes was directed in May 1658 to assign a squadron to join with French naval forces at Marseilles for a combined operation against Spain, he reluctantly gave its command to Whetstone. Stokes hoped to tie him down by a set of very restrictive instructions, but in the event Whetstone indulged in junketing ashore while quarrelling with his officers and sending bitter complaints to England. The joint operation did not materialize. On receiving news of Cromwell's death in September 1658 Stokes at last found the courage to dismiss Whetstone, and sent him back to England as a prisoner, with the approval of the new protector, Richard. Whetstone was examined by the council of state, and a court martial nominated to try him, though in April 1659 he complained that he was still waiting for a chance to clear his name. In June Whetstone threw in his lot with the royalists, who believed, falsely, that as Cromwell's nephew he would be a valuable tool to win over the fleet. He crossed to Brussels, where Charles II knighted him and dispatched him to Copenhagen in late June with a promissory letter to Mountagu, commanding the English fleet in the sound. But Whetstone was too well known, and too unpopular, to be able to make direct contact, and his cover was blown when he bumped into Mountagu and the republican commissioner Sidney in the street. Mountagu had him conveyed secretly back to Flanders, and the intrigue ended in farce. Whetstone returned to England at the Restoration, destitute, and was languishing in a debtors' gaol in Marshalsea by 1661. He bombarded the government with petitions for employment, and also begged the estates of his late stepfather, the regicide Colonel John Jones, who had been executed for treason in October 1660. The king eventually agreed to pay him &pound;100 to set him up as a planter in Jamaica, and he sailed in the spring of 1662. Shortly before, in December 1661, he obtained a licence to marry Anne Dehuberlant (<i>b</i>. 1630/31), a widow. Whetstone quickly established himself as a leading figure in Jamaica, with the support of its governor, Sir Thomas Modyford. By 1663 he was commanding a force of thirteen privateers, and he served as speaker of the Jamaica assembly in 1664. In 1666 he led a force which seized the Spanish colony of Providence Island, but the Spaniards recaptured the island in August and Whetstone was sent prisoner to Panama, where he was held in irons for seventeen months. Though eventually released, he was never heard of again, and probably died soon afterwards. A flood of complaints in the late 1650s had characterized Whetstone as insolent, arrogant, greedy, and idle, and his short-lived naval career remains an object-lesson in the dangers and temptations of nepotism.<br>
