<span class="headword">Walker,  George Washington</span>  (1800&#150;1859), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born in London on 19 March 1800, the twenty-first child of John Walker (1726&#150;1821) and his second wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ridley. His mother died early and his father moved to Paris, and he was brought up by a grandmother at Newcastle upon Tyne as a Unitarian. He was confirmed by a bishop, and sent to a Wesleyan school at Barnard Castle. Apprenticed to a Quaker linen draper in Newcastle in 1814, he attended meetings of the Society of Friends; in 1827, influenced in part by James Backhouse, the York Quaker, he joined the society. An attachment to his master's daughter, who soon after became blind and died on 3 November 1828, much influenced his character at this time.<br>
<br>In 1831, in obedience to a &#145;call&#146;, Walker accompanied Backhouse on what turned out to be a twenty-seven-year mission to the southern hemisphere. They landed at Hobart Town on 8 February 1832, after a five months' voyage. Encouraged by the governor of Van Diemen's Land, Sir George Arthur, they visited convicts, and reported on the living conditions of convicts and Aborigines (there and on Flinders Island). In Launceston they gathered a body of Quakers, who held their first yearly meeting in 1834. By that meeting Walker was acknowledged a minister. After three years in Van Diemen's Land, Walker and Backhouse went to Sydney and made the acquaintance of Samuel Marsden, the senior chaplain there. When they returned to Hobart, at the request of the new governor, Sir John Franklin, they assisted Alexander Maconochie in the writing of his controversial report on penal conditions. In 1838 they travelled to Cape Town, visiting Mauritius on the way. They toured all the mission stations in South Africa, regardless of denomination, in a journey of 6000 miles.<br>
<br>When they parted on leaving South Africa in September 1840, Walker returned to Hobart Town and on 15 December 1840 married Sarah Benson Mather, a member of a Wesleyan family which had joined the Friends; they had ten children and were prominent members of the Quaker community, with both parents becoming noted philanthropists. Walker set up as a linen draper but devoted himself chiefly to moral causes, attaching a savings bank and a <span class="roman">Bible</span> distribution centre to his business. Regardless of considerable opposition&#151;on one occasion threatened with being tarred and feathered&#151;he preached the virtues of temperance and was active in convict and Aborigine welfare programmes. He and his wife (also a Quaker minister) became active in finding employment for destitute women. Walker possessed &#145;the gentle methodological persuasion of a Quaker resolved to effect a change in a vicious brutal world&#146;  (<span class="italic">AusDB</span>). He died in Hobart Town on 2 February 1859 and was buried on 4 February in the Friends' burial-ground, Providence Valley, West Hobart, Tasmania. His house, Narryna, later became the Van Diemen's Land Folk Museum.<br>
