<span class="headword">Hoby, Sir  Edward</span>  (1560&#150;1617), <span class="occ">politician and diplomat</span>, was born at Bisham, Berkshire, on 20 March 1560, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13414/', "Sir Thomas Hoby (1530&#150;1566)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth (1528&#150;1609), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke")</script> of Gidea Hall, Essex, and later wife of John, Lord Russell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13411/', "Russell, Elizabeth, Lady Russell")</script>]. The puritan magistrate and MP Sir Thomas Posthumous Hoby was a younger brother. From 1571 Edward attended Eton College, where he struck up a lasting friendship with Sir John Harington, the courtier and translator. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, as a gentleman-commoner on 11 November 1574, aged fourteen. He was allowed to graduate BA on 19 February 1576, after only eight terms, and proceeded MA on 3 July of the same year. Thomas Lodge the dramatist was a &#145;scholar&#146; under him at Trinity. In June 1576 Hoby obtained a dispensation to travel on the continent, which he did until 1579. Subsequently, as he stated in his <span class="italic">Counter-Snarle</span>  (pp. 61, 72), he entered the Middle Temple, but he does not appear in its surviving records. <br>
<br>Hoby had the means to provide for an independent lifestyle. He succeeded his father upon the latter's death in 1566, and when his mother purchased his wardship, his lands in Berkshire and Worcestershire were valued at &pound;220 a year. One of the most highly educated women of her time, Hoby's mother prepared him for his career at the royal court. Through her he was related to the Cecils and Cookes, and his access to the court was increased by his marriage to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1605), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4649/', "Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon")</script>, on 21 May 1582. He was knighted by the queen at Somerset House on the day after the wedding. Local offices came quickly afterwards. He was appointed JP for Berkshire, Kent, and Worcestershire from 1583, Middlesex from 1593, and Surrey from 1601. <br>
<br>Under the auspices of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4983/', "William Cecil, Lord Burghley")</script>, Hoby rose into high favour at court, and was frequently employed on confidential missions. In August 1584 he accompanied his father-in-law on a special mission to Scotland. His affability and learning greatly impressed James VI. After attending the Scottish ambassador as far as Durham, Hoby received from James a flattering letter in which the king intimated his longing for his company, and how he had &#145;commanded his ambassador to sue for it&#146;. James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, also wrote to the same effect, enclosing a &#145;small token&#146; which he begged Hoby &#145;to wear in testimony of their brotherhood&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot. ser.</span>, <i>1509&#150;89</i>, 489). The queen disliked these signs of favour, and Hoby found it convenient for a time to plead the ague as an excuse for not attending the court. Domestic troubles also harassed him. <br>
<br>Hoby was returned MP for Queenborough, Kent, in 1584 and 1586, gaining distinction as a spokesman in the Commons. On 31 October 1586 he complained that he had been &#145;not only bitten but overpassed by the hard hand of&#146; Sir Francis Walsingham, and appealed to Secretary William Davison to use his influence with the queen on his behalf  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1581&#150;90</i>, 365). Argumentative, he quarrelled with Lord Burghley, Sir John Conway, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and Sir Thomas Heneage. Ultimately restored to favour through his mother's interventions, in July 1588 Hoby was chosen to report to the queen on the progress of preparations against the Spanish Armada in the Isle of Sheppey, where he also served as grain commissioner. <br>
<br>Elected MP for Berkshire in 1589, Hoby introduced a bill on 14 February against the extortions of exchequer officials, and spoke out against royal purveyance. He was reproached by Burghley but the house cleared his name of breaching its privileges, although his plan for reforming the exchequer was defeated by the queen, who regarded him as one of those &#145;busy&#146; against her prerogative; none the less in 1592 she visited him at Bisham. In the parliaments of 1589 and 1593 Hoby was an active member of committees for harbour repairs, parliamentary privilege, purveyance, poor relief, and subsidies. In 1593 he was publicly rebuked by the queen and briefly placed under house arrest for insulting a fellow committee member, the privy councillor Sir Thomas Heneage. <br>
<br>Hoby's career moved more fully to Kent when he was chosen MP for the county in February 1593. Having served as vice-admiral of Milton hundred since 1585, he was appointed <i>custos rotulorum</i> of the county in 1594. He took an active role as judge in the Milton hundredal court. Royal favours included in 1594 letters patent for buying and providing wool for sale in England for ten years, which were ratified in the succeeding reign. Hoby's only military endeavour was accompanying the expedition to Cadiz in 1596. Appointed constable of Queenborough Castle on the Isle of Sheppey, on 9 July 1597, he kept detailed records of his work there. On the following 28 October he received a commission to search out and prosecute all offences against the statute prohibiting the export of iron from England, his reward being half the forfeitures. He continued to serve the queen in diplomatic ventures, and had established a correspondence with the Russian diplomat Grigory Ivanovich Mikulin by 1602. <br>
<br>Elected MP for Rochester in 1597 and 1601, Hoby was particularly active in those parliaments. He sat on at least fourteen committees and most of his work was on economic, legal, and religious issues. In 1601 he chaired the privileges and returns committee, and distinguished himself in urging the house to protect its privileges in individual cases, and to make precedents in issuing election writs. He had several confrontations with Sir Robert Cecil, but in the debate on monopolies he stood for not challenging the royal prerogative no matter how &#145;foul&#146; its practices  (Henderson and Philips, 2.322). Hoby's favour at court enabled him to act as a knight of the canopy at the queen's funeral in 1603. He continued to be elected for Rochester in the succeeding parliaments of 1604&#150;10 and 1614. <br>
<br>Hoby's career at court was solidified at the accession of James I. The king made him a gentleman of the privy chamber in 1605, and forgave him by warrant the arrears of rent of the royal manor of Shirland, Derbyshire, amounting to over &pound;500. Earlier Hoby had defaulted on the rent of properties in Kent leased from Brasenose College, Oxford, and was sued successfully in 1593 for &pound;500 in arrears. Hoby, blessed with wealth, had little acumen to preserve it. He turned again to the royal court and James granted him an exclusive licence on 21 August 1607 to buy wool in Warwickshire and Staffordshire. Hoby frequently entertained the king at Bisham, but his social relationship did not include the king's political agenda. <br>
<br>While most is known about his career as a parliamentarian in the later parliaments of Elizabeth I, Hoby was perhaps a more important figure in the early parliaments of James I. According to contemporary MPs in the parliaments of 1604&#150;14, his appearances were impressive, his manner affable, his head clear, and his knowledge of parliamentary history and usage unparalleled  (Notestein, 61). An independent figure, often at odds with court policies, he was listened to attentively. A candidate for speaker in 1604, he was quite effective in promoting the house's position on privileges, precedents, and impositions, and using delaying tactics to stymie Anglo-Scottish union. Sitting as a commissioner for the bill on union, he refused to subscribe his name to the engrossed document (Inner Temple MS 537, 8.123). He was often appointed as the Commons' representative on joint committees of the Lords, and the record shows that he stood up to the Lords strongly and effectively, pushing the independence of his house. When his own personal interests were at issue in attacks on the wool monopoly, accusations of his &#145;jobbing and brogging&#146; were quietly dismissed in the Commons  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary of Robert Bowyer</span>, 141). <br>
<br>Hoby was a keen theologian, collector, and scholar. He spoke out for tough laws against recusants in Elizabeth's reign. In James's reign he contested with the Catholic convert Theophilus Higgons and the Jesuit John Floyd, publishing his exchanges with them between 1609 and 1615 in such works as <span class="italic">A Counter-Snarle for Ishmael Rabshacheh, a Cecropidan Lycaonite</span> (1613) and <span class="italic">A curry-combe for a coxe-combe &hellip; in answer to a lewd libell lately fornicated by Jabal Rachil against Sir Edward Hobies &#145;Counter-Snarle&#146;</span> (1615). His religious views were of a moderate Calvinist conformist to the Church of England. He was an inveterate collector, and manuscripts that he is known to have owned include medieval English poetry, fifteenth-century herbal and medicinal remedies, and Dutch medical treatises  (BL, Add. MSS 8151, 4897&#150;4899). He collected and placed in Queenborough Castle portraits of many of its constables. Hoby was also a copious letter-writer, copyist, and&#151;like his father&#151;translator. His published works included a translation from Latin of Matthieu Coignet as <span class="italic">Politique Discourse upon Trueth and Lying</span> (1586), and from the Castilian of Bernardino de Mendoza as <span class="italic">Theorique and Practise of Warr</span> (1597). Hoby cultivated the friendship of learned men, especially William Camden, who eulogized his bounty and accomplishments in <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (under &#145;Bisham&#146; and &#145;Queenborough&#146;). Camden also dedicated his <span class="italic">Hibernia</span> (1587) to him. In 1612 Hoby presented to the library of Trinity College, Oxford, Sir Henry Savile's sumptuous edition of <span class="italic">St Chrysostom</span>. <br>
<br>Hoby's first wife died in 1605; about 1613 he married Cecily, daughter of Sir Edward Unton and widow of Sir John Wentworth of Gosfield Hall, Essex, who survived him. Hoby died in Queenborough Castle on 1 March 1617 and was buried at All Saints' Church, Bisham: his will asked that he be buried without pomp or ceremony in the family chapel there. <br>
<br>Hoby had no children from his marriages. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son with Katharine Pinckney, <a name="cosubject_13412"></a><span class="headword">Peregrine Hoby</span>  (1602&#150;1679), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 1 September 1602. Hoby recognized the boy as his heir, brought him up, and at his death committed him to the care of Archbishop George Abbot. Peregrine attended Eton College between 1612 and 1616. He may have served on the expeditions to Cadiz in 1625 and to La Rochelle in 1627. He initially resisted compounding for knighthood in 1630 but eventually promised to pay &pound;30. On 14 April 1631 he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1687), daughter of Sir William Doddington of Breamore, Hampshire. In 1640 Hoby was elected to the Long Parliament as MP for Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire (which lay just across the Thames from Bisham), in a pair of controversial elections on 21 October, and, after the Commons ordered a new election, on 23 November. Hoby was elected by the corporation in the first election, though the householders who challenged such a restricted franchise apparently would also have voted for him but not the other MP then elected. His second election, on a broader franchise, was challenged in the committee of privileges on the grounds that the franchise, which included the bargemen and almsmen of the town, was now too wide: &#145;Mr Maynard mooved that the poore should not have a voice&#146;  (Hirst, 78). His election was confirmed, but the situation was further complicated because just before the second election he had been pricked as sheriff, which precluded him from leaving the county and sitting as MP. Indeed, though Hoby's election was confirmed in January 1641, he was apparently required to serve out his term as sheriff and was absent from the Commons for most of the year. He was present by June 1642 and was an active member from 1643 to 1648. In the same period he sat on the parliamentarian county committee for Berkshire. He was secluded from the Commons at Pride's Purge, returning to the Commons in 1659 when the representation of Great Marlow was restored. He sat for the borough in the Convention Parliament (1660) and in the Cavalier Parliaments (1661&#150;78), where he was very much a second- or third-rank figure. He was moderately active on committees and showed some concern with the danger of popery: in 1667 he brought before the Commons a complaint (unfounded, as it turned out) about the Jesuits seducing a young heir. The earl of Shaftesbury in 1677 considered Hoby politically sympathetic, noting him as &#145;worthy&#146;. Peregrine Hoby was buried at Bisham on 6 May 1679.<br>
