<span class="headword">Sewell,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1687, <em>d.</em> 1726), <span class="occ">author and physician</span>, the eldest son of John Sewell, treasurer and chapter clerk to the dean and canons of Windsor, was baptized on 2 June 1687 at St George's Chapel, Windsor. He was educated at Eton College, being admitted as a king's scholar on 7 August 1699. Reminiscences of his schooldays were included in his poem &#145;The Favourite, a Simile&#146;. He was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 25 June 1706, where he graduated BA in 1709. For a time he studied medicine under Hermann Boerhaave at the University of Leiden, and about July 1725 he took the degree of MD at Edinburgh University. Sewell practised at first in London for some years, but without success. He then moved to Hampstead, where he met with better fortune, until competition ruined his practice. Necessity forced him to become a booksellers' hack, publishing numerous poems, translations, and political and other pamphlets.<br>
<br>As a young man Sewell inclined to toryism, and was a bitter critic of Bishop Burnet, whom he attacked in five pamphlets published between 1713 and 1715. He also wrote two pro-tory essays, in which he criticized the arguments of Sir Richard Steele. However, by 1718 he had attached himself to the cause of Sir Robert Walpole.<br>
<br>Sewell's best-known production remains his markedly anti-Spanish play the <span class="italic">Tragedy of Sir Walter Raleigh</span> (1719), first performed at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and later revived at Drury Lane in 1789. A man &#145;of amiable disposition&#146;, and possessing &#145;a very considerable genius&#146;  (Cibber, 4.191), Sewell contrived to link his name with some of the most distinguished writers of this period, including Joseph Addison, Matthew Prior, John Phillips, and Alexander Pope, adding a seventh volume to the latter's 1725 edition of Shakespeare. It was perhaps as a result of this unsolicited contribution that Pope, in the first edition of his &#145;Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot&#146;, wrote of &#145;Sanguine Sew&#151;&#146;. Sewell revived his former interest in medicine with an account of Archibald Pitcairne (whose &#145;medical dissertation&#146; he translated in 1717), which was posthumously attached to George Cheyne's <span class="italic">History of himself</span> (1743). Sewell died of consumption at Hampstead, in great poverty, on 8 February 1726 and was given a pauper's funeral on 12 February.<br>
