<span class="headword">Shairp,  John Campbell</span>  (1819&#150;1885), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born in Houston, in the parish of Uphall, Linlithgowshire, on 30 July 1819, the third son in the family of eleven children of Norman Shairp (1779&#150;1864), a major who had served in the infantry in the army of the Bengal presidency in India from 1799 to 1816, and of Elizabeth Binning Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of John Campbell of Kildalloig, Argyll.<br>
<br>After preliminary training by a tutor, a Mr Bell from Dumfriesshire, in the family home, Shairp was educated at Edinburgh Academy (1829&#150;32), in George Ferguson's class, where he laid the basis of his scholarship. During 1835 he and his brother attended private classes in Edinburgh, where he was first introduced to the poetry of Wordsworth. From 1836 to 1839 he attended Glasgow University, where he excelled at logic and moral philosophy and was awarded prizes for logic, Greek, ethic (poetical composition), and humanity (translations from the Latin). He was part of a lively social community at Glasgow, centring on the Peel Club, which debated contemporary issues and included members such as Norman Macleod and Henry Douglas (who later became bishop of Bombay, and whose sister Shairp was to marry). In this circle he honed his skills as a public speaker, and developed his passion for literary criticism, especially the criticism of poetry. On leaving Glasgow, he spent a winter in Edinburgh, before moving to Oxford in April 1840, where he won the Snell exhibition to Balliol. Here he attended lectures in logic and moral philosophy, in addition to classics and speculative philosophy. He once more found a lively circle of friends among the brightest undergraduates, which included the poet Arthur Hugh Clough, John Duke Coleridge, and Arthur Stanley (later to be dean of Westminster); much of this period in his life he later chronicled in his poem &#145;Balliol scholars: a remembrance (1840&#150;43)&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>. During this period at Oxford he became deeply impressed by the leading figures of the Oxford Movement&#151;which was then at its height&#151;especially John Henry Newman and John Keble, although his own religious convictions retained their attachment to the theology of the Church of Scotland. The influence of Matthew Arnold also came to be felt by Shairp during his period at Oxford, and Shairp later admitted that Arnold and Newman were the two biggest influences on his intellectual and religious character. In 1842 he won the Newdigate prize with a poem on Charles XII of Sweden, and it became his first publication. He took his degree in Easter 1844, and unsuccessfully attempted to gain a fellowship at Oriel.<br>
<br>In 1846 Shairp was offered a mastership at Rugby School by A. C. Tait, his former tutor at Balliol, and he remained there until 1857. Although he enjoyed his time at Rugby, with its exceptionally high teaching standards, and where he mixed school lessons with tutoring private pupils, his nationalist feelings were awoken, and he spent several years trying to find a position in his native Scotland. On 23 June 1853 he married Eliza Douglas at Bute House, Petersham, and they had two sons, the first of whom, Norman (<i>b</i>. 1855), died in infancy, and the second of whom, John Campbell (<i>b</i>. 1858), was to become advocate and sheriff substitute of Argyll at Inveraray. In November 1856 Shairp took leave of absence from Rugby to teach Professor Lushington's class at Glasgow University. Soon afterward, however, he secured the position of assistant to the professor of Latin at the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard at St Andrews University. His initial stipend was so low that he was forced to take private pupils, a situation which was resolved in 1861 when he was appointed to the professorship. He made a number of close friendships during this period, particularly with the philosopher John Veitch.<br>
<br>Shairp began to publish regularly from this point on, with articles appearing in <span class="italic">Good Words</span> and the <span class="italic">North British Review</span>. Although he had published his introductory lecture at St Andrews as <span class="italic">The Uses of the Study of Latin Literature</span> (1858), his first major publication was <span class="italic">Kilmahoe: a Highland Pastoral</span> which <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> viewed favourably, describing it as a &#145;spring of genuine poetry&#146;  (Knight, 234). In 1866 Shairp was unsuccessful in his candidature for the chair of ethics at Glasgow, but continued to publish, with his <span class="italic">John Keble: an Essay</span> (1866), and his important collection of essays and articles, <span class="italic">Studies in Poetry and Philosophy</span> (1868). During this latter year he was appointed by the crown to the principalship of the United College at St Andrews, and as a result also took on a large number of administrative duties as a member of the university court. He later became closely involved with the establishment of a college at Dundee (later to become Dundee University).<br>
<br>A steady stream of publications flowed from Shairp's pen during this period: numerous articles in journals such as <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, and another volume of essays, entitled <span class="italic">Culture and Religion</span> (1870), which became an instant success, reaching a third edition by 1872, the same year in which his <span class="italic">Studies in Poetry and Philosophy</span> reached its second. Between 1872 and 1873 Shairp masterminded the publication of <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of J. D. Forbes</span>, his great friend and fellow academic at St Andrews. The volume was eventually published by Macmillan in 1873, after a prolonged and tortuous editing process. In the following year his edition of Dorothy Wordsworth's <span class="italic">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland in AD 1803</span> further demonstrated his powers as a literary critic, as well as his deep admiration for Wordsworth.<br>
<br>In June 1877 Shairp was elected professor of poetry at Oxford, and awarded the degree of MA. His candidature had been supported by his old mentor, Matthew Arnold. In 1879 his book on Burns, published in the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series, received mixed reviews. His first lectures at Oxford disappointed many, but were published as <span class="italic">Aspects of Poetry</span> (1881). He held the post jointly with the principalship at St Andrews until his death. The University of Edinburgh honoured him with the degree of doctor of laws in 1884.<br>
<br>Shairp enjoyed walking, especially in the highlands of Scotland, and in the countryside surrounding Yarrow in the borders. It was the Scottish landscape which inspired him to take up poetry. His other passion was for riding, and in particular, hunting. From about 1880, however, his health began to fail, and he eventually died of heart disease at Ormsary House, Ormsary, Argyll, on 18 September 1885. He was buried in the ancestral vault at Houston.<br>
