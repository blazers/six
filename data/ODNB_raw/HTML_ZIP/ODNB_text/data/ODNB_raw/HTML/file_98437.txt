<span class="headword">Meijer,  Reinder Pieter <span class="st"> [Rein]</span></span>  (1926&#150;1993), <span class="occ">Dutch scholar</span>, was born on 2 January 1926 in Zwolle, the Netherlands, the son of a head teacher. Little is known about his youth and early years, most probably because both he and his brother, the writer Henk Romijn Meijer (1929&#150;2008), left the provincial Dutch town of their birth for Amsterdam at the earliest opportunity. In 1944 he completed his grammar school education in Zwolle, before moving in 1945 to post-war Amsterdam, where he studied Dutch language and literature at the University of Amsterdam. He became part of a group of young &#145;Neerlandici&#146;, or Dutch scholars, immortalized in the fiction of their colleague J. J. Voskuil. It was during this period that he met his wife, Edith, who was to remain his constant companion thereafter.<br>
<br>Alongside his studies, Rein Meijer also worked as a research assistant at the Instituut voor Dialectologie in Amsterdam from 1948 to 1951, from where he was sent out into the field to follow the linguistic boundary between Dutch and French in Belgium. This he did on foot and by bicycle, becoming familiar with the language and culture of Flanders, something which would inform his later appreciation of the linguistic unity of the two Dutch-speaking territories. Having completed his studies in 1950, Meijer moved to Australia where he took up a teaching post at the University of Melbourne in 1951. There he embarked on a PhD on the work of the troubled twentieth-century Dutch poet Gerrit Achterberg. The doctorate was awarded in 1958 and though the thesis itself was never published, its subject featured in Meijer's work, including a special issue of <span class="italic">Poetry Australia</span> in 1974 devoted to post-war Dutch and Flemish poetry, which was selected and introduced by Meijer. The volume opened with &#145;Trumpet&#146; and &#145;Statue&#146; by Gerrit Achterberg in strong translations by Meijer himself.<br>
<br>Although most of his professional life was devoted to teaching and writing about literature, as a lecturer in Dutch outside the Netherlands Meijer faced the challenge of students who knew little or no Dutch on coming to university. His first book, written with Jacob Smit, a colleague at the University of Melbourne, was a textbook for learners of Dutch, <span class="italic">A Dutch Grammar and Reader</span>. Published in 1958, it was one of the main textbooks in use at many universities around the world for some twenty years. Meijer's empathy and understanding, combined with an insistence on high standards, made him a memorably successful teacher.<br>
<br>In 1971 Meijer took up the chair of Dutch studies at Bedford College in the University of London, where his interest in the relation between the language and culture of the Netherlands and that of Flanders provided the topic of his inaugural lecture, &#145;Dutch and Flemish: Two Literatures or One?&#146;. As head of department, he consolidated the department of Dutch into a serious player in the field of Dutch studies, steering it through the rough waters of university reorganization to a new location at University College, London. This created opportunities for interdisciplinary research and teaching long before these became the norm: Meijer initiated a Centre for Low Countries Studies which brought language and literature scholars together with specialists in Dutch history and art history. He retired from the chair of Dutch studies in 1988, following a year spent teaching in Jakarta (1983&#150;4) and a period of ill health.<br>
<br>Meijer's major contribution to the field of Dutch literature was as a commentator, chronicler, literary historian, and, as Dick Boukema described him, a literary &#145;gatekeeper&#146;. From about 1966 Meijer had begun to review new fiction for the Dutch newspaper <span class="italic">NRC Handelsblad</span> under the pseudonym of P. M. Reinders, and continued to do so, producing more than 700 reviews of Dutch and English fiction by the time of his death. As well as helping to shape literary tastes in the Netherlands, he also wrote a more considered chronicle of Dutch literature for colleagues teaching at universities outside the Netherlands and Flanders in the journal of the International Association for Dutch Studies. The idea of regular chronicles on publications relevant for practitioners of Dutch studies was Meijer's own, which he duly put into practice for Dutch literature from 1978 onwards. His last chronicle appeared posthumously in October 1993.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Literature of the Low Countries</span>, first published in 1971, completed Meijer's influence on the perception of Dutch literature and to some extent on the creation of a literary canon. In it he provided a history spanning the entire literary production of the Low Countries, that is, of both the Netherlands and Flanders, from the early medieval period to modern times. By contemporary Dutch standards it was a remarkably concise work, setting out to capture the bigger picture while at the same time offering lucid literary portraits, not so much of the writers themselves, but of their writing. Meijer demonstrated an unerring sense of the distinctive contribution of each writer, particularly of his (and only occasionally her) style of writing, characters, and preoccupations. As a literary historian he was most at home with the twentieth century, where his personal preferences played a part in his judgement. He championed the personal and subjective at a time when many of his colleagues, particularly in the Netherlands, were intent on becoming more scientific. He was something of a stylist himself, both in Dutch and English, producing a limpid prose which rejected fussiness and pomposity, reminiscent in its insistence on everyday language of the Dutch poets of the 1930s whose unassuming diction he so admired. The closing words of <span class="italic">Literature of the Low Countries</span> were later much quoted: &#145;where the present tense asserts itself, History bows out&#146;  (2nd edn, 1978, 375). In 1978, the year in which the second, revised edition of <span class="italic">Literature of the Low Countries</span> appeared, Meijer's beautifully written introduction to the novel <span class="italic">Max Havelaar</span> was published in the <span class="roman">Penguin Classics</span> series. In it, he created a vivid picture of the book's author, the former Dutch colonial administrator Multatuli (Eduard Douwes Dekker), preparing the reader for the complexities and tensions of an extraordinary narrative once described by D. H. Lawrence as &#145;the greatest mess possible&#146;  (Meijer, &#145;Introduction&#146;, Multatuli, <span class="italic">Max Havelaar</span>, 1978, 10).<br>
<br>Meijer understood the importance of professional networks for teachers of Dutch who often worked on their own or in small departments. He was a founder-member of two associations: the Association of Dutch Language Teachers in the UK and the International Association for Dutch Studies, whose journal, <span class="italic">Neerlandica Extra Muros</span>, he helped to develop into a serious academic publication in the field of Dutch studies. During his retirement in Muswell Hill, London, he continued to work with literature in both Dutch and English. He collaborated with his wife, Edith, on translations of work by Saul Bellow and John Updike into Dutch, and in 1993, the year of his death, he published a reader of Dutch literature for learners of Dutch (co-edited with Jane Fenoulhet), <span class="italic">Basisteksten Nederlands: Proza, 1930&#150;1990</span>. He died at his home in Firs Avenue, Muswell Hill, London, on 29 September 1993, of cancer of the colon, having been supported throughout his final illness by Edith and their three children. He was cremated on 8 October 1993.<br>
