<span class="headword">Craig,  Edward Anthony <span class="st"> [Teddy; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>pseud. </em>Edward Carrick]</span>  (1905&#150;1998), <span class="occ">film and stage designer and artist</span>, was born on 3 January 1905 in London, the third child and first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32608/', "(Edward Henry) Gordon Craig (1872&#150;1966)")</script>, the renowned theatrical designer, and Elena Fortuna Meo (1879&#150;1957), a virtuoso violinist. Theatre and art were in his blood. His paternal grandparents were the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36460/', "Ellen Terry (1847&#150;1928)")</script> and the architect and designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10889/', "Edward Godwin (1833&#150;1886)")</script>; his maternal grandfather was the artist Gaetano Meo (1849&#150;1925), whose commissions included mosaics in St Paul's and Westminster cathedrals and Ernest Debenham's London mansion.<br>
<br>Gordon Craig lived a turbulent, romantic existence, and was absent for most of Teddy's infant years, which were spent in Southminster, Essex. Teddy never had a formal education, instead living a bohemian life, travelling around Europe with his parents and sister Nelly; he had periods in London and Kent with Ellen Terry, but the family finally settled in Rapallo on the Italian riviera. At the age of twelve he became his father's pupil assistant. Craig was a temperamental and impatient taskmaster, who expected him to become a Renaissance man on the wing. Teddy mastered a vast range of crafts, becoming an expert draughtsman, model-maker, wood-engraver, printer, and photographer, helping his father to produce the journal <span class="italic">The Mask</span> and other publications.<br>
<br>By 1926 Teddy had become his father's indispensable helpmate and business manager, and seemed destined to spend his life in his father's shadow. But he was determined to become independent, taking the first steps in 1923 by adopting a pseudonym, &#145;E. Carrick&#146;, for his wood-engravings (&#145;carrick&#146; being the Irish equivalent of the Scottish &#145;craig&#146;). When his father sent him to London in 1927 Teddy jumped at the opportunity to break free. Armed with charm, enthusiasm, and boundless talent, he kept himself afloat by designing book jackets, selling wood-engravings, and writing art criticism. But like his father he was a man of vision, and he saw cinema as the art of the future.<br>
<br>A chance meeting with his stepgrandfather, the actor James Carew, led to Craig's first break into the film world. In 1927 Edward Carrick, as he was to be known professionally for the rest of his film career, began working for the enlightened film-maker George Pearson at the Welsh-Pearson-Elder company, at Stoll Studios, Cricklewood. His first film was directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky, and he was soon being touted in the press as the youngest art director in England. With the security of his new job Carrick married Helen Ruskin Godfrey (1899&#150;1960), the sister of an architect, on 23 October 1928, at the Paddington register office, London. Their two children, John (<i>b</i>. 1931) and Helen (<i>b</i>. 1934), followed the family's artistic path, John as an illustrator, Helen as a photographer and an author&#150;illustrator of children's books. Following the collapse of Pearson's Cricklewood operations owing to the advent of sound, Carrick earned a precarious freelance living. He persuaded the restaurateur Peppino Leoni to display art at his Quo Vadis restaurant in Soho, founding the &#145;Grubb Group&#146; of artists, who held annual shows throughout the 1930s. Along with wood-engraving and book illustration, writing also kept Carrick busy: he became one of cinema's first practitioners to write extensively about design.<br>
<br>Carrick also painted murals on commission. One was for the stage director Basil Dean. About to go into film production, he invited Carrick to become the art director at his new studios in Ealing. Carrick worked there from 1931 to 1935, designing, among others, the screen version of John Galsworthy's <span class="italic">Loyalties</span> (1933), a trio of Gracie Fields musicals, <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Midshipman Easy</span> (1935), for which he built an ingenious ship atop scaffolding on the studio lot. Carrick's attention to period detail for <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span> was much admired, and several of his designs were acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum. By now Carrick was in demand, and in 1935 he became art director for the short-lived Criterion Film Productions, founded by Douglas Fairbanks jun. and Marcel Hellman.<br>
<br>Carrick was always generous in sponsoring and nurturing new talent, and in 1937 he founded the first film school in England, the AAT (Associated Artist Technicians') School, at 14 Soho Square. After bomb damage caused its abrupt closure early in the war, Carrick continued to formulate his ideas, teaching and inspiring people through his groundbreaking textbook on art direction, <span class="italic">Designing for Moving Pictures</span> (1941; revised in 1949 as <span class="italic">Designing for Films</span>). Although film was Carrick's primary occupation, throughout the 1930s he was also busy designing London stage productions, including <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> at the Old Vic (1932), Emlyn Williams's psychological thriller <span class="italic">Night must Fall</span> (1935), and J. B. Priestley's allegory <span class="italic">Johnson over Jordan</span> (1939). During the war years Carrick's gift for scenic realism proved invaluable as art director for the Crown Film Unit and the various service documentary units. Working with directors like Humphrey Jennings, Harry Watt, and Pat Jackson on such classic documentaries as <span class="italic">Target for To-Night</span> (1941), <span class="italic">Fires were Started</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">Western Approaches</span> (1944), Carrick made a direct contribution to the war effort, coping all the while with budgetary and rationing restrictions and government red tape.<br>
<br>After the war Crown's output shifted to peacetime concerns. When Crown moved from its base at Pinewood Studios, Carrick stayed to become supervising art director for the Rank Organization. Here he gave many new talents their first film work, and proved a gifted administrator as executive art director for Rank's umbrella organization, Independent Producers. Always active in promoting film design as an art form, Carrick continued to write and lecture about film-making and design. He became one of the prime movers behind the first British film designers' guild, the Society of British Film Art Directors and Designers. He also organized the society's showcase exhibition &#145;British Film Art&#146; at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1948, and compiled an invaluable related catalogue, <span class="italic">Art and design in the British film: a pictorial directory of British art directors and their work</span> (1948).<br>
<br>Through all the vicissitudes of the industry in the 1950s and early 1960s Carrick continued to design films, primarily as a freelance, bending his talents to a range of material: wartime stories (<span class="italic">Gift Horse</span>, 1951), thrillers (<span class="italic">Tiger Bay</span>, 1959), romantic comedies, pop musicals, Hammer horror (<span class="italic">The Nanny</span>, 1965, starring Bette Davis). In 1960 he did his only designing for television, of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> for America's prestigious series <span class="roman">Hallmark Hall of Fame</span>; filmed in colour on location in Scotland with Maurice Evans and Judith Anderson, it was a play he knew well, as he had designed productions at the Old Vic in 1932 and Stratford in 1949. In 1965 he retired from film design to concentrate on research, writing, and lecturing. He wrote a biography of his father, <span class="italic">Gordon Craig: the Story of his Life</span>, which was published in 1968 two years after Craig's death, and a book about baroque theatre construction, a subject dear to his heart.<br>
<br>Carrick and his first wife, Helen, had separated about 1940 and later divorced; on 15 December 1956 he married Patricia Craig, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marchant, but this marriage collapsed in 1957. He married (Evelyn) Mary Timewell (<i>b</i>. 1922), a film production secretary, on 10 September 1960 at Aylesbury, and they settled into a long and happy marriage, living first at Cutler's Orchard, Bledlow, and then at Southcourt Cottage in Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire. Despite ill health in his final years, Teddy Craig remained enthusiastic, ebullient, and charming to the end. When he spoke about the past and his enthusiasms, the years would drop away. He died, survived by his wife, on 21 January 1998 at Victoria Cottage Hospital, East Street, Thame, Oxfordshire, and was cremated on 29 January at Oxford crematorium, Headington.<br>
<br>Thanks to Craig's passion for collecting and preserving things (his father sometimes referred to him as &#145;the Magpie&#146;), there are Craig/Carrick collections at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and the British Film Institute, London. His work is also in the collections of the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Yale Center for British Art.<br>
