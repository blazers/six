<span class="headword">Wigram,  William Ainger</span>  (1872&#150;1953), <span class="occ">advocate of the Assyrian church and people</span>, was born on 16 May 1872 at the vicarage in Furneaux Pelham, Hertfordshire, one of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36891/', "Woolmore Wigram (1831&#150;1907)")</script>, vicar of Brent Pelham with Furneaux Pelham, and his wife, Harriet Mary (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/233/', "Revd Thomas Ainger")</script>, of Hampstead. A baronetcy in the Wigram family descended to William's older brother Edgar in 1920. Wigram was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and matriculated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1891. He took his degree in 1893 and became a pupil of Bishop B. F. Westcott of Durham. He was ordained deacon in 1896 and priest in 1897, and served two assistant curacies in the Durham diocese, the latter at St Barnabas, Sunderland. There he was recruited by O. H. Parry in 1902 for the Archbishop of Canterbury's Mission to the Assyrian Christians. The archbishop's mission worked to sustain the Assyrian Church of the East (more commonly called the Nestorian church) in Persia and Turkey by means of schools, printing, parish work, and support for the patriarch. Wigram served ten years in the mission, the last five (1907&#150;12) as its head. His chief responsibility was to conduct a school for boys and ordinands in Van in eastern Turkey. In 1910 he removed the school to Bibaydi in the mountains north of Mosul in an attempt to challenge the Catholic dominance over the local Christians. A tireless walker, he toured villages, making frequent visits to the patriarch's remote home of Kochanes. Wigram's experiences in the country of the Church of the East, recorded in anecdotal style, can be read in his book <span class="italic">The Cradle of Mankind</span> (1914, with illustrations by Edgar Wigram).<br>
<br>Unlike some others associated with the mission, Wigram never became discouraged about the future of the Church of the East. He remained a trusted adviser of Archbishop Randall Davidson, who awarded him the Lambeth degree of DD in 1910. Wigram's most notable success was in bringing the Assyrian Church of the East into contact with the wider ecclesiastical world. His book <span class="italic">The Assyrian Church, 100&#150;640 A.D.</span> (1910) popularized this name for the church among English speakers. The book also argued that the Nestorianism of the Church of the East was merely nominal. Others had come to this conclusion before, but Wigram gave it practical effect. Legislation to allow intercommunion between the Anglican churches and the Church of the East, taken up by the Lambeth conference of 1910 and finally passed in 1920, was largely the result of his diplomacy among the bishops on both sides.<br>
<br>Seeking other work with eastern churches, Wigram left the Assyrian mission in 1912 for a chaplaincy in Constantinople. There he was overtaken by the First World War and interned. In 1918 he was intercepted on his way home and posted to Mesopotamia as a political officer to help manage the resettlement of the displaced Assyrian people in their old lands. The resettlement failed, however, as did all efforts to re-start the archbishop's mission. With the election of an eleven-year-old boy to the patriarchate in 1920 the church further weakened itself, but Wigram continued to support the patriarch as the only credible political leader of the whole people. After five years in Greece (1922&#150;6) as chaplain to the British legation, Wigram visited Iraq again in 1928. His conviction that the British government owed the Assyrians a settlement as an autonomous people (expressed in a number of occasional writings, although toned down for his book <span class="italic">The Assyrians and their Neighbours</span>, 1929) made him unwelcome to the authorities there. After the end of the British mandate in 1932, the treatment of the Assyrians by the new Iraqi government confirmed his belief that Britain had betrayed them. Wigram accompanied the young patriarch Mar Eshai Shimun to Geneva to plead his cause before the League of Nations in 1933. Wigram's intransigence lost him the confidence of Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang, and when in 1938 Lang finally gave over responsibility for relations with the Assyrians to the bishop of Jerusalem, Wigram retired from Anglican&#150;Assyrian affairs in disgust.<br>
<br>Wigram held a canonry of St Paul's Church, Malta, from 1928 to 1936. He was a well-known lecturer for the Hellenic Travellers' Club and author of <span class="italic">Hellenic Travel</span> (1947). He never married, and from about 1929 lived with his sister at Green Acres, Wells, Somerset. He died on 16 January 1953 at the Old Manor, Salisbury, Wiltshire. One of the last visitors to call on him before his death was Mar Eshai Shimun.<br>
