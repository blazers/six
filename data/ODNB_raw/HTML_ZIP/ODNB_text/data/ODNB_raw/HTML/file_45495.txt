<span class="headword">Williams, Dame  Juliet Evangeline  Rhys</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Juliette Evangeline Glyn]</span>  (1898&#150;1964), <span class="occ">political activist and public servant</span>, was born on 17 December 1898 at Sheering Hall, Sheering, Essex, the younger of the two daughters (there were no sons) of Clayton Louis Glyn (1857&#150;1915), barrister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33428/', "Elinor Glyn, n&#233;e Sutherland (1864&#150;1943)")</script>, novelist. She was educated at The Links, Eastbourne, but left at the age of fifteen to join the Voluntary Aid Detachment. In 1918 she became private secretary to the director of training and staff duties at the Admiralty, and in 1919 assistant secretary of the war cabinet demobilization committee. Later the same year she became private secretary to the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Transport, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Rhys Williams, first baronet (1865&#150;1955), Coalition Liberal MP for Banbury and son of Gwilym Williams, county court judge, of Miskin Manor, Pont-y-clun, Glamorgan. They married on 24 February 1921. There were four children of the marriage: Glyn David Rhys (1921&#150;1943), Susan Eleanor (<i>b</i>. 1923), Brandon Meredith Rhys (<i>b</i>. 1927), and (Marion) Elspeth (<i>b</i>. 1937). Sir Rhys Williams changed his name by deed poll to Sir Rhys Rhys Williams on 26 November 1938; thereafter the family was known by the surname Rhys Williams.<br>
<br>In the years immediately following the First World War Juliet Williams was primarily occupied with raising her children. Nevertheless, in 1924 she and her husband went to Hollywood to help bring her mother's business affairs into order; while there Juliet Williams wrote the continuity for her mother's second film for MGM, <span class="italic">His Hour</span>. In the 1930s she was actively involved in social and medical work, particularly relating to maternity services and child welfare. She was honorary treasurer of Queen Charlotte's Hospital Anaesthetic Fund from 1928 to 1939, honorary secretary of the Joint Council of Midwifery from 1934 to 1939, and a member of the interdepartmental committee on abortion from 1937 to 1938. She was also a founder member of the National Birthday Trust in 1928, and its chair from 1957; as such she was active for many years in organizing medical research relating to maternity services. In 1937 she was made a DBE in recognition of her part in the drafting of the <span class="roman">Midwives Act</span>, 1936. During the Second World War she served as an assistant commercial relations officer in the ministry of information and then (from 1940) as an assistant section officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. In 1942 she was appointed a dame of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem. Her elder son, Glyn David Rhys Williams, a captain in the Welsh Guards, was killed in action in Tunisia in April 1943.<br>
<br>Between the wars Juliet Williams had developed a keen interest in economics and attended study groups such as the Economic Research Council (of which she later became vice-president). She published <span class="italic">Something to Look Forward to</span> in 1943, and <span class="italic">Family Allowances and Social Security</span> in 1944, both advocating and providing detailed plans for the development of a welfare state. She was also actively involved in Liberal Party politics. She stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the Liberal interest twice (at the Pontypridd by-election in 1938, and at Ilford North during the general election of 1945). She was honorary secretary of the Women's Liberal Federation from 1943, and chair of the publications and publicity committee of the Liberal Party from 1944 to 1946; she resigned after a disagreement on policy matters with her party's leaders.<br>
<br>After the Second World War, Juliet Rhys Williams's passion was European unity. At the Hague Congress of May 1948, the high point of federal aspiration, she acted as secretary of the economic section, responsible for producing the economic and social resolution (&#145;The Congress &hellip; affirms the urgent need for an economic union in Europe&#146;). Back in Britain she had already become a leading light in the various organizations which urged British involvement in the European construction. She was an early member and secretary of the British committee of the European League of Economic Co-operation, founded in 1946. She also joined as secretary (from 1947 to 1958) and later chair (from 1958) the United Europe Movement, and from 1951 to 1954 was editor of <span class="italic">European Review</span>.<br>
<br>From these vantage points Juliet Rhys Williams encouraged the Macmillan&#150;Eccles duo to bring forward in the council of Europe constructive alternatives, which Britain could support, to the Schuman plan for a coal and steel community (1950). In 1953, when Europe was agonizing to no ultimate effect over the institution of a defence community, she urged upon Macmillan, now in the cabinet, that the only method of remaining a world power was to go in with Europe: &#145;Britain cannot possibly remain a world power upon the present basis. The Commonwealth is non-existent, except as a coronation pageant &hellip; To continue upon the present line &hellip; is to court utter disaster.&#146; But if Britain opted for Europe, she argued, it would &#145;have the full approval of America, and will, indeed, be America's saviour inasmuch as she succeeds in holding West Germany to the Western side&#146;. To Macmillan, she &#145;combined a remarkable knowledge of technical economics with an almost prophetic power of grasping the long term implications of large questions&#146;. The document which she sent him was &#145;remarkable in its prescience&#146;  (Macmillan, 475&#150;7).<br>
<br>Juliet Rhys Williams was described by her <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist as &#145;a tremendous dynamo&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Sept 1964). She was a prolific writer, if not in her mother's &#145;nonsensical and ungrammatical&#146; vein. Hers were mainly heavy pieces on traditional Liberal themes, including <span class="italic">Taxation and Incentive</span> (1952), advocating the replacement of state benefits by universal subsistence allowances and heavier taxation of earned income. Nevertheless, there were lighter interludes, including <span class="italic">Aircraftswoman Grey</span> (1943), <span class="italic">Stern Daughter</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Dr. Carmichael</span> (1946), and <span class="italic">49 Chances</span> (1947). She was a governor of the BBC (1952&#150;6), director of the <span class="italic">Economic Digest</span> (1954&#150;8), and chair of the Cwmbr&acirc;n Development Corporation (1955&#150;60). She died at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queen Square, Holborn, London, on 18 September 1964, of craniopharyngioma. She was survived by her younger son (the second baronet) and her two daughters, her husband having predeceased her in 1955.<br>
