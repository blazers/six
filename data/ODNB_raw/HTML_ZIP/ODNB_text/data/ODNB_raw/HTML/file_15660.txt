<span class="headword">Kirkcaldy, Sir  William, of Grange</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1573), <span class="occ">soldier and politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15659/', "Sir James Kirkcaldy (d. 1556)")</script> and Janet Melville, daughter of Sir John Melville of Raith. He was listed with his father, then treasurer of Scotland, following James V's death on 14 December 1542, as a witness of a purported statement of the king's will. His father probably arranged his presence in order to promote his prospects under the new regime during the minority of Mary, queen of Scots.<h2>
<a name="StAndrewsandFrance"></a>St Andrews and France</h2>William Kirkcaldy and his father seem to have been early converts to protestantism, and Sir James lost his post as treasurer in 1543 when Cardinal David Beaton, archbishop of St Andrews, orchestrated a move away from reforming policies. The two Kirkcaldys participated in the audacious capture and murder of Beaton on 29 May 1546; and William Kirkcaldy was the first man to enter St Andrews Castle, after which it was occupied by the murderers. Kirkcaldy was sent to London to seek English aid and was rewarded on 3 September with &pound;50 sterling as the first instalment of an irregularly paid pension. He had evidently returned by the time the castle was besieged by a French force under Leone Strozzi. On 30 July 1547, after bombardment, the castle surrendered to Strozzi, and Kirkcaldy and the other &#145;castilians&#146; were taken as prisoners to France. According to John Knox, another of the prisoners,<blockquote>they arrived first at F&eacute;camp and thereafter passed up the water of Seine and lay before Rouen; where the principal gentlemen, who looked for freedom, were dispersed and put in sundry prisons. The rest were left in the galleys, and were miserably treated. (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 1.96&#150;7)</blockquote>Kirkcaldy's lands were forfeited on 27 November 1547. The escape of three Scots, including Kirkcaldy, from Mont-St Michel was reported to Henri II on 25 June 1550; Knox dated it to the previous Epiphany (6 January). On 26 February 1551 the English ambassador in France, Sir John Mason, reported that he had accepted Kirkcaldy's offer of his services as a spy, with the alias of Coraxe. However, there is no further evidence of Kirkcaldy's action in this role, perhaps because of the downfall of the duke of Somerset.<br>
<br>It appears that Kirkcaldy next joined the French army, probably for Henri II's spring offensive of 1552 into Lorraine. Henri Cleutin, seigneur d'Oysel, Henri II's lieutenant-general in Scotland, wrote to Mary of Guise from France on 19 August 1553, informing her that the French king and the constable, Anne de Montmorency, intended to make use of Kirkcaldy's talents in their dealings with Scotland. Sir James Melville, who served in Montmorency's train from 1553 to 1557, mentions Kirkcaldy in connection with the death of Norman Leslie, master of Rothes (another of the former castilians), at the battle of Renty in August 1554: &#145;no man made more dull [i.e. mourning] nor the laird of Grange, who came to the camp the next day after, from a quiet raid where he had been directed&#146;  (Melville, 26). By 30 November 1556 the English ambassador in France, Nicholas Wotton, reported:<blockquote>[Kirkcaldy] offers to serve her Majesty [Mary Tudor] for the like pension he had formerly in England, wherever she pleases and whether in England, the Low Countries, or here, says he shall have good intelligence of the affairs of Scotland and of France by his intimacy with both those nations.(TNA: PRO, SP 69/9/146<i>v</i>&#150;149<i>r</i>, in cipher; cf. <span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1553&#150;8</i>, 277)</blockquote>On 1 March 1557 Wotton reported that Kirkcaldy desired to see Scotland delivered from the yoke of the French, commenting: &#145;either he must be a very great and crafty dissembler or else he bears no good will at all to the French men and next to his own country he bears a good minde to England&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 69/10/43<i>r</i>). Meanwhile, Kirkcaldy petitioned the French king for restoration to his and his father's lands and titles, which was granted by Mary, queen of Scots at Henri II's special desire at Paris on 17 February 1557 (see original charter, NA Scot., GD 26/1/4/86), and on 28 May he was at Dieppe waiting for a ship to Scotland. In September 1558 he was arrested by the English at Berwick as a spy, but was apparently released.<h2>
<a name="Problemsofidentity"></a>Problems of identity</h2>The problems involved in determining Kirkcaldy's activities in the 1550s are compounded by the eulogy of him written by Sir James Melville, which has been a key source for his biographers. Melville asserts that during Kirkcaldy's sojourn in France from 1547 to 1557 he was captain of 100 light horse and was extolled by the dukes of Vend&ocirc;me and Aumale and the prince of Cond&eacute;. Whereas Montmorency would only speak to him &#145;on couerit&#146;, Henri II called him a &#145;valliant man&#146; and chose him as a sporting companion; Henri also gave him a pension which Kirkcaldy chose to ignore. Kirkcaldy's biographers have assumed that he commanded one of the regular companies that formed the core of the French standing army; these originated from the fifteen ancient <i>companies des ordonnances</i>, of which the Scots were considered the &#145;premier company&#146;. Unfortunately it is impossible to substantiate any of Melville's assertions in the French archives, and if Kirkcaldy really had been a captain of one of the <i>companies des ordonnances</i> it would have been recorded. Foreign mercenaries were often employed as temporary &#145;extraordinary&#146; troops in addition to the regular French army, and Kirkcaldy was probably captain of 100 Scots in this category. Melville's stories about Kirkcaldy would apply much more closely to James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, who served the French crown with distinction as a soldier in the 1550s. When writing his memoirs in the 1590s, Melville could hardly laud Arran, who had been insane since 1562, but may have borrowed some of the incidents of Arran's career in order to construct his eulogy of Kirkcaldy.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithQueenMary"></a>Relations with Queen Mary</h2>From early 1559 Kirkcaldy was often at the forefront of political events in Scotland. He may well have joined Mary of Guise's service in or soon after 1557, and in early 1559 was closely associated with William Maitland of Lethington, who had been appointed royal secretary by Mary in 1558; both participated in the protestant and anti-French uprising against her. Sir James Croft, the English governor of Berwick, reported on 20 July 1559:<blockquote>Money is owing [to Kirkcaldy] for serving in the late wars, in the hope whereof he drives time. The man is poor and cannot travail in these matters without charges, wherein he must be relieved by the Queen [Elizabeth] if these proceedings go forwards. (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1558&#150;9</i>, 1.401)</blockquote>A few days later Kirkcaldy openly declared himself with the protestants.<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy took a leading part in the fighting that followed, conducting numerous skirmishes and ambushes and helping to besiege Sempill Castle. The English ambassador, Thomas Randolph, praised Kirkcaldy in February 1561: &#145;of any other besides this man, Grange deserveth most for his earnest affection to the Queen's [Elizabeth's] service; and his credit and means thereto are as good as many a greater name&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1547&#150;63</i>, 515). In October 1561 Kirkcaldy was again called to serve when fighting erupted on the borders. His military skills were also used in the campaign against the fourth earl of Huntly that culminated in the battle of Corrichie on 28 October 1562. On 1 November following he was rewarded with the barony of Nauchtane, in a grant that shows he was now a knight.<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy joined the uprising of the earl of Moray and other lords against Mary's marriage to Darnley in August 1565. He was forced to relinquish his house of Hallyards, and when the uprising collapsed he fled with the others to England. He returned with Moray at the time of the murder of David Riccio on 9 March 1566, and was pardoned on the 25th. After the murder of Darnley and the acquittal of the leading suspect, the fourth earl of Bothwell, the latter began moves to marry the queen. On 20 April 1567, when a number of nobles were signing the so-called Ainslie bond supporting the marriage, Kirkcaldy wrote a frank letter to the second earl of Bedford expressing his view that Bothwell had been responsible for Darnley's death. He initially suggested how Mary could retrieve the situation: having &#145;lost the favour we bore to her, yet if she will pursue revenge for the murder, she will win the hearts of all honest Scotsmen again&#146;. However, he added:<blockquote>she intends to take the prince out of Mar's hands and put him in Bothwell's keeping, who murdered his father &hellip; for she has said she cares not to lose France, England and her own country for him, and shall go with him to the world's end in a white petticoat. (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1563&#150;9</i>, 2.322&#150;3)</blockquote>It appears that there was a long-standing mutual dislike between Kirkcaldy and Bothwell, and Kirkcaldy now felt committed &#145;to enterprise the revenge&#146; of Darnley's murder: &#145;I must either take it in hand or leave the country, which I am determined to do, if I get licence; but Bothwell minds to cut me off when I obtain it&#146;. He urged Bedford, &#145;I pray you let know what your mistress will do, for if we seek France, we may find favour: but I would rather persuade to lean to England&#146;  (ibid., 2.325).<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy was requested to write again to Bedford on 8 May following a meeting of the earls of Argyll, Morton, Atholl, and Mar, at Stirling, where they decided to seek Mary's liberation from Bothwell (who had abducted her on 24 April). Kirkcaldy was in the lords' army against Mary and Bothwell at Carberry on 15 June, and it was to him that Mary surrendered. On 10 August, after the queen's deposition, Kirkcaldy and Sir William Murray of Tullibardine were commissioned to pursue the fugitive Bothwell. They sailed to Orkney but Bothwell escaped. On their return in September Kirkcaldy was appointed captain of Edinburgh Castle by Regent Moray.<br>
<br>Mary escaped from Lochleven Castle on 2 May 1568. On 8 May Kirkcaldy signed a bond with the provost of Edinburgh, Sir Simon Preston of Craigmillar. In Moray's force at Langside on 13 May, Kirkcaldy commanded the horsemen and was rewarded with the escheat of the laird of Bass. Thereafter he moved slowly away from supporting the regent, apparently influenced by Maitland, but the progress of his defection is hard to chart. In February 1569 he was still a loyal supporter of Moray when Maitland clearly was not. Maitland's escape to Edinburgh Castle on 9 September, however, was arranged by Kirkcaldy. On 16 September Maitland wrote to the duke of Norfolk that Kirkcaldy &#145;will be good in all her [Mary's] causes so far as with honour he may. He mislikes altogether my lord regent's proceedings in as much as he doth see him run a direct course to his own overthrow&#146;  (Cameron, 1.69). Kirkcaldy, however, was still receiving gifts from the king's party in October, and in that month he was also elected provost of Edinburgh. Sir William Drury reported on 9 December that Kirkcaldy was loyal to the king's party. After Moray's murder on 10 January 1570, Kirkcaldy carried the standard at his funeral on 14 February. Randolph wrote in April that he did not doubt Kirkcaldy's sincerity, &#145;except Lethington enchant him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1569&#150;71</i>, 125).<h2>
<a name="Takingsides"></a>Taking sides</h2>Further English doubts soon emerged. The earl of Sussex reported to Elizabeth on 4 May 1570: &#145;understanding the Laird of Grange might be alienated from his former good affection towards your majesty, I wrote a very plain letter to him&#146;; to which Kirkcaldy had replied on 29 April:<blockquote>[the] whole matter rests on two heads: the one, that I have declined from my old friends in this realm who heretofor have desired the amity of England; the other that I have given countenance to others who have capitulated to the French.</blockquote>Kirkcaldy claimed that:<blockquote>all my friends, so far as I know, are yet desirous of the amity of England &hellip; particularly towards the Queen's majesty, as well for benefits received of her father and brother by me and my friends, as for religion's sake, and her honourable dealings with this realm in the beginning of her reign. (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1569&#150;71</i>, 149, 151&#150;2)</blockquote>He refused to march on Glasgow with Sussex and the king's party in June, and refused them entry to Edinburgh Castle. He seems to have resented the domineering attitude of the English towards Scotland and their preference for Lennox as regent. Kirkcaldy refused to co-operate in Lennox's appointment, and would not even shoot off any ordnance from the castle to mark the occasion.<br>
<br>On 6 December 1570 Kirkcaldy wrote to Sir William Cecil with an assessment of his own position in Anglo-Scottish affairs. He reminded Cecil of &#145;the lamentable estate of this country&#146;, of &#145;the unnatural division of the noblemen and &#147;whole body&#148; of this realm&#146;, which in his own small way he had tried to &#145;extinguish&#146;. He had also offered his services to Queen Elizabeth as he believed it was within her power &#145;to bring these two realms to their former amity&#146;, because &#145;if either of the parties should be &#147;forced&#148; to seek remedy by foreign forces, the end thereof will be miserable&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1569&#150;71</i>, 440). Cecil replied on 10 January 1571 that he could not &#145;promise any more than his former doings declare&#146;  (ibid., 462), to which Kirkcaldy responded with barely concealed hostility on 29 January. In March he was entering into confrontation with the burgh of Edinburgh, and his men took and fortified the steeple of St Giles. In the castle he had the royal regalia, the principal store of ordnance, and the state papers of the kingdom. By 13 April he was openly refusing to recognize Lennox as regent. His public position was that he had always been loyal to Moray but that the cause he and Moray represented had been betrayed by Moray's successors.<br>
<br>In the meantime Kirkcaldy and Maitland were negotiating with France for assistance. Monsieur Verac was sent as French ambassador, officially with instructions to seek a reconciliation between the Scottish factions, but as soon as Verac arrived at Leith on 5 July he was detained by the king's party. In his coffers was found correspondence with Maitland and Kirkcaldy concerning Mary's restoration.<br>
<br>At the end of August 1571 the regent held a parliament at Stirling. Kirkcaldy, the fifth earl of Huntly, and the lairds of Ferniehurst and Buccleuch along with 280 horsemen and sixty harquebusiers made a surprise attack on the town on 4 September. They captured many prisoners, including the regent, but were forced to release them when a relieving force issued from Stirling Castle. During the affray Lennox was killed and the Marians retreated. In the aftermath Kirkcaldy was forfeited for the third time in his life, on 30 September, and on 5 September a full-scale siege of Edinburgh Castle began.<h2>
<a name="CastilianinEdinburgh"></a>Castilian in Edinburgh</h2>Kirkcaldy sent his brother James to the French court to seek aid, his arrival there being reported on 5 January 1572. Although there are a number of notices of James Kirkcaldy's imminent departure from the French court from 31 January 1572 onwards, he did not return to Scotland until January 1573. A truce was agreed between the queen's and king's parties on 1 August 1572 for two months, and it was later extended to the end of the year. The new regent, Morton, offered Kirkcaldy and the castilians the same terms as Mar had proposed when he was regent. But Kirkcaldy insisted on a universal amnesty, which Morton would not accept. He therefore invested the castle, and on 1 January 1573 Kirkcaldy signalled the resumption of hostilities by a bombardment of the town. When James Kirkcaldy finally returned to Scotland bearing the long-awaited money and munitions from France for the queen's party, he was captured and his precious cargo and ship confiscated on Morton's instructions.<br>
<br>At the urging of Elizabeth's representatives Morton's government made a final attempt at conciliation with the castilians. On 27 March 1573 Henry Killigrew sent Kirkcaldy and Maitland the pacification of Perth by which the conditional surrender of the remaining nobles of the queen's party had recently been agreed (23 February). On 6 April the fifth earl of Rothes, an old friend of Kirkcaldy, entered the castle as mediator, but he was no more successful than others had been. Kirkcaldy now stipulated that all his personal debts were to be paid, that he should retain Blackness Castle, and that the English should guarantee his life. As regards Queen Mary's jewels, &#145;the said laird of Grange shall not be [ac]countable therefore nor charged in any sort to make reckoning or deliverance of the same or any part thereof to any person but only to herself&#146;; and finally, all properties should be returned to him and his supporters  (Cameron, 1.120&#150;25). After the king's party rejected these terms, Sir William Drury and an English army crossed the border in April while siege guns were sent by sea to Leith. On 28 May, after eleven days of bombardment, the castle surrendered. Kirkcaldy, Maitland, and nine other leaders were imprisoned.<br>
<br>On 29 May Maitland and Kirkcaldy wrote to Lord Burghley, begging that they might be allowed to go to live in England. On 31 May Morton told Burghley that the fate of the prisoners &#145;rests now in her majesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1571&#150;4</i>, 575). Maitland died on 9 June. At some stage after the fall of the castle a bond of manrent was offered to Morton in return for Kirkcaldy's life, by which 100 gentlemen promised Kirkcaldy's loyalty and their own to Morton if Kirkcaldy were spared. The offer was refused. At the end of July, Morton finally received advice from Queen Elizabeth that she would leave &#145;the judgment and ordering of those matters to him&#146;  (ibid., 582). Kirkcaldy was tried for treason on 3 August 1573 and executed in Edinburgh the same day, fulfilling John Knox's prophecy that he would &#145;hang from a gallows in the face of the sun&#146;  (Hewitt, 27). Kirkcaldy was survived by his wife, Margaret Learmonth (daughter of Sir James Learmonth of Dairsie, provost of St Andrews), whom he had married between 1557 and 1564, by their daughter Janet, and by an illegitimate daughter whose recent birth was mentioned in 1573. His lands were eventually restored to his nephew William in 1581.<br>
<br>In the end Kirkcaldy emerges as a Scottish martyr along the lines of, but not to the same degree as, William Wallace, who also had been a laird, soldier, and charismatic leader of men, and who also was hanged, drawn, and quartered for his adherence to his honour, principles, and ideals. The English ambassadors Killigrew and Randolph &#145;boisted planly to bring down that proud gyantis pryd, wha presumed to be a nother Wallace, as they allegit&#146;  (Melville, 257). Kirkcaldy wanted the peaceful union of Scotland with England, with two independent equal kingdoms, united by the protestant religion, each having its own hereditary monarch. This desire was na&iuml;ve, as no Tudor monarch would have countenanced it.<br>
<br>Melville's assessment of Kirkcaldy's personal character is credible: he was &#145;a lusty, stark and well-proportioned personnage, hardy and of a magnanimous courage&#146;; in all his enterprises he was &#145;secret and prudent&#146; and when he was &#145;victorious, he was very mercifull, and naturally liberal&#146;, a friend to all men in adversity and an enemy to greed and ambition. Some loved him for &#145;his religion, uprightness and manliness&#146;, others &#145;depended upon him for his good fortune and apparent promotion, whereby divers of them hoped to be advanced and rewarded&#146;. But Melville goes too far when he claims that Kirkcaldy &#145;refused sundry great offices, even the office of Regent, and benefices and great pensions&#146;  (Melville, 257&#150;8). Kirkcaldy was granted and accepted appointments, benefices, and pensions befitting his status of laird. His character has been over-romanticized, but does contain much to admire. His importance before 1559 has been exaggerated, but from that date onwards he was often a consequential figure.<br>
