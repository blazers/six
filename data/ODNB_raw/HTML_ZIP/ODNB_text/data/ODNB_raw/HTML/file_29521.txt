</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (1796&#150;1839), <span class="occ">missionary in the Pacific islands</span>, was born at Tottenham High Cross, Middlesex, on 29 June 1796, fifth of the six children and second of the three sons of John Williams and his wife (<i>d</i>. 1819), whose maiden name was Maidment and whose first name was probably Hannah. Although his father's side of the family had been Baptists since the seventeenth century, his father was not pious. The dominant religious influence in the family came from his mother, a daughter of an affluent china and glass merchant who was associated with the Revd William Romaine of St Ann Blackfriars, London, and the Calvinistic Methodists. She later joined an Independent chapel.<br>
<br>Williams received his elementary education near Tottenham at a school in Lower Edmonton. In 1810, destined for a commercial career, he was apprenticed to Enoch Tonkin, a furnishing ironmonger in City Road, London. As a young apprentice he was conventionally lukewarm about religion; he later described himself as not &#145;outwardly immoral, tho. very wicked&#146;  (Gunson, &#145;John Williams&#146;, 75). Invited by his employer's wife to attend Moorfields Tabernacle on 30 January 1814, he was converted by a powerful sermon by the Revd Timothy East of Birmingham on the text: &#145;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&#146; In September 1814 Williams was admitted to church membership. He also became a teacher in the Sunday school, where he gave his first public addresses, and attended meetings of the tabernacle auxiliary to the London Missionary Society (LMS).<br>
<br>The minister of the tabernacle, the Revd Matthew Wilks, fired Williams's imagination with accounts of the work of the LMS and the millions of heathen &#145;daily perishing for lack of knowledge&#146;  (Gunson, &#145;John Williams&#146;, 76). This led, in July 1816, to Williams applying to the LMS as a missionary candidate. He was accepted and was appointed to the south seas mission, centred on the Society Islands. The directors of the LMS evidently decided that his knowledge of theology and scripture was adequate, for, unlike most other candidates, he was not required to undertake formal theological study at the LMS seminary at Gosport. Fascinated by technology, Williams instead prepared himself for missionary work by finding out as much as he could about mechanical and manufacturing processes of all kinds. Even before he left England he was forming a philosophy of missions in which the teaching of &#145;saving knowledge&#146; was combined with instruction in the arts of civilization. The conversion of a &#145;heathen&#146; people to Christianity, he always insisted, would inevitably produce among them a desire for civilization. It was a view shared by many LMS missionaries of his generation.<br>
<br>Williams, with eight others, was ordained for work in the LMS mission field at Surrey Chapel in London on 30 September 1816. The following month, on 29 October 1816, he was married to Mary Chawner (<i>d</i>. 1851), a fellow member of Moorfields Tabernacle, who had also been accepted by the LMS as a suitable person to go out to the mission field as his wife. On 17 November 1816 they embarked in London in the <i>Harriet</i>, in a party of LMS missionaries bound for the Pacific. Williams loved ships; his wife found sea voyaging a misery. On the outward voyage the ship called at Hobart in Van Diemen's Land, where the LMS missionaries conducted the first dissenting service in the colony, and at Sydney in New South Wales, where they established friendly relations with evangelical Anglicans and Methodists. The mission party then sailed in the <i>Active</i>, first to the Church Missionary Society mission in New Zealand and then to the Society Islands, which they reached on 17 November 1817.<br>
<br>The LMS south seas mission had begun in 1797, when the first party of missionaries arrived at Tahiti in the Society Islands. The Tahitian mission had made no headway for some years and at one stage was nearly abandoned, but its success was assured in 1815 when the principal chief, Pomare II, having changed his allegiance from the god Oro to Jehovah, gained paramountcy over the islands of Tahiti and Moorea. This was followed by a general movement in favour of Christianity. In the Society Islands, Williams initially spent seven months with other LMS missionaries on Moorea, where he quickly learned Tahitian. After a further three months on Huahine, where he preached his first sermon in the local language, in September 1818 he and his fellow missionary L. E. Threlkeld moved with their families to Raiatea to begin a permanent mission station. Raiatea had once been the centre of the worship of the god Oro. The islanders had outwardly accepted Christianity, but Williams deplored what he described as their continuing licentiousness, idleness, and &#145;abominable&#146; customs  (Prout, 16). He devoted much time and skill to building a substantial house with seven rooms and a veranda, with carpeted floors and furniture made by himself. This was intended to be a model for Christian converts, who were encouraged to leave their scattered settlements in the interior and build European-style cottages in a village on the shore, near the new chapel. Eventually the majority of them did so. Williams also taught them the &#145;useful arts&#146; of carpentry, plastering, boat building, and blacksmithing. He was full of energy and optimism.<br>
<br>Williams was critical of the directors of the LMS, who he believed had no real knowledge or understanding of the local situation. He was particularly outraged by their decision that the ship <i>Haweis</i>, begun by the Tahiti missionaries and which he had completed, should be sold. &#145;I have never seen a kind, Christian-like, affectionate, encouraging letter from the Directors, since I have been in connection with the Society&#146;, he told them in 1820  (Gutch, 25). At about this time he requested a transfer to a more significant and demanding mission field. However, his mood changed. By the end of that year he had decided to stay in the Pacific. Having learned of the existence of island groups to the west of the Society Islands, he realized that these offered plenty of scope for his restless energy. The first breakthrough was in 1821 when, through contacts with the Christians of Raiatea, the entire population of the small island of Rurutu in the Austral group accepted Christianity. He soon dreamed of extending the mission to every island group in the south Pacific.<br>
<br>It was Williams's view that the expansion of Christianity in the Pacific islands promoted the extension of trade and civilization. To this end he dreamed of having a ship that would take the island products of sugar cane and tobacco to Sydney. Through participation in commerce, Christian islanders would be led towards industrious habits and prosperity; they would also provide a market for British manufacturers. With a vessel of his own, moreover, he himself could be independent and travel wherever he pleased. In a famous letter to the LMS he wrote that, &#145;for my own part I cannot content myself within the narrow limits of a Single reef&#146;  (Gunson, <span class="italic">Messengers of Grace</span>, 145). In 1822 he achieved his objective. While visiting Sydney for treatment for filariasis, he bought the schooner <i>Endeavour</i> for the Christian chiefs of the Society Islands using money he had inherited from his mother, who had died in 1819. Governor Brisbane of New South Wales had a high opinion of Williams and his plans. He appointed him as a justice of the peace and gave presents to assist the work of the mission, as well as cows, calves, and sheep for the Christian chiefs. With a ship at his disposal, Williams sought openings for Christian teachers in unevangelized islands. The directors of the LMS, on the other hand, disapproved of the purchase of the <i>Endeavour</i> and deplored Williams's involvement of the society in commerce. When the ship failed to pay its way it had to be sold, in 1823.<br>
<br>In 1823 Williams placed Raiatean teachers on several of the Cook Islands group. He claimed to have discovered Rarotonga, the largest island, though he already knew of its existence and was not in fact the first European to land there. On his second visit to Rarotonga in 1827&#151;stranded without a vessel and unable to return to Raiatea&#151;he supervised the building, with ingenious use of local materials, of a 50 ton two-masted schooner. Named the <i>Olive Branch</i>, it was more familiarly known as the <i>Messenger of Peace</i>. In this vessel he sailed further afield. In 1830 he set out on a missionary voyage that was intended to reach Fiji and the New Hebrides (Vanuatu). Calling first at Tonga, he learned of the dangers for Europeans in the &#145;dark islands&#146; of southern Melanesia and decided to go instead to Samoa. While in Tonga he claimed to have made a compact with the two Wesleyan missionaries, Peter Turner and William Cross, that the mission fields in Tonga and Fiji would be left to the Wesleyans, while the LMS would have missionary charge of Samoa. At Williams's insistence this agreement was ratified by the directors of the two missionary societies in London in 1836, but it was disputed by the Wesleyans in Tonga whose work had already diffused to Samoa. Williams was the first European to introduce Christianity into Samoa in 1830. By this time he was more positive in his view of native custom than when he first arrived in the Pacific. With a Samoan chief who had been living in Tonga acting as intermediary, he was able to leave eight teachers on the island of Savai'i, under the protection of the powerful chief, Malietoa. When he made his second voyage to Samoa in 1832 the conversion of the Samoans to Christianity was under way, and the LMS church soon became the focus of the religion of the majority of the population.<br>
<br>Early in 1834 Williams with his wife and three sons took the opportunity of a passage on a visiting whaling ship to return to England. They arrived on 12 June and stayed for almost four years. Williams had several objects: the raising of money to support the LMS mission and for a ship to replace the <i>Messenger of Peace</i> (sold in 1833); the printing of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and other religious works in the language of Rarotonga; and the preparation for publication of a manuscript, based on his journals, on missionary work in the Pacific islands. To arouse interest in the work of the LMS he went on lengthy lecture tours through England and Scotland; he was rarely at home with his family at Bedford Square in London. Although his delivery was described as heavy and his voice monotonous, he became a popular publicist for the missionary cause: &#145;Common sense was his great and distinguishing quality; and the conviction which irresistibly darted into the mind of every hearer, was,&#151;This is an honest man!&#146;  (Campbell, 201). One of his favourite themes was the advantage to British commerce that inevitably followed the spread of Christianity: &#145;not one ship has ever been taken, not one drop of British blood has ever been shed at any island, after the inhabitants had been brought under Christian instruction&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Missionary's Farewell</span>, 77).<br>
<br>Williams's account of his missionary voyages to the Cook Islands and Samoa, <span class="italic">A Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands</span>, was published in 1837. In an imaginative bid to boost its impact, he persuaded the directors of the LMS to send copies to fifty members of the nobility, with a letter soliciting a donation. Money and commendations flowed in. Williams, conscious of his humble background and lack of education, delighted in aristocratic and royal patronage. His book, illustrated by the printmaker George Baxter, was to become the most popular work on the Pacific islands since the <span class="italic">Voyages</span> of Captain James Cook; within six years 38,000 copies had been sold. In 1836&#150;7 Williams gave evidence to the parliamentary select committee on Aborigines, and by the time he left England in 1838 he had become a celebrity. His London valedictory meeting at Moorfields Tabernacle on 4 April 1838 was a huge demonstration of enthusiasm for the protestant missionary movement. A report of the addresses was published as <span class="italic">The Missionary's Farewell</span> (1838).<br>
<br>Williams had wanted to return to the Pacific with a ship of his own. With &pound;4000 that he raised from the public for the purpose, he bought and fitted out a 200 ton brig, the <i>Camden</i>. This was the first official LMS missionary vessel, but to the annoyance of his co-workers he appeared to regard it as his own possession. On its outward voyage it was alleged that one-third of its cargo space was occupied by trade goods belonging to Williams's eldest son, John Chawner Williams, who was intending to set himself up as a trader in Samoa and who was later British consul there (1858&#150;74).<br>
<br>Having settled on Upolu in Samoa, Williams was eager to be on the move again. For him the next missionary frontier lay in the islands of Melanesia, and in particular the New Hebrides group which, he believed, was the key to the evangelization of the region. On his first missionary voyage in the <i>Camden</i>, on 20 November 1839 he landed with two companions at Dillons Bay on Eromanga in the southern New Hebrides. While walking inland the party was attacked by a party of islanders. James Harris was killed on the spot; the rest of the party fled to the ship's boats, but Williams was clubbed to death in the shallows. It was believed that their bodies were subsequently eaten. The reason for the killings was not immediately apparent. At the time missionaries interpreted the attack as an act of revenge for the misdeeds of sandalwood traders at Eromanga ten years earlier, but this seems unlikely. It is more probable that the missionary party unwittingly violated a taboo by approaching food prepared for a local feast. In February 1840 a British warship, HMS <i>Favourite</i>, was sent from Sydney to Eromanga to investigate the killings. The naval party obtained the bones and skulls of Williams and Harris, which were buried at Apia, Samoa, on 31 March 1840.<br>
<br>Through his violent death, at the peak of his missionary career, so soon after his successful visit to England, Williams became a heroic figure among English nonconformists and the subject of a huge popular literature. The Revd Dr John Campbell of Moorfields Tabernacle reflected that &#145;for the purposes of history, he died in the proper manner, at the proper place, and at the proper time&#146;  (Campbell, 228). Baxter's prints of Williams and his martyrdom at Eromanga only added to his reputation. Williams was indeed a &#145;remarkable all-round missionary&#146;  (Garrett, 86) and a chief-like figure, but his image was greater than his actual achievements. From 1844 until 1971 a succession of LMS ships in the Pacific were named after him.<br>
