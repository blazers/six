</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alcock, Sir  John William</span>  (1892&#150;1919), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born at Basford House Cottage, Seymour Grove, Old Trafford, Manchester, on 6 November 1892, the eldest son of John Alcock, a domestic coachman and later a horsedealer, and his wife, Mary Whitelegg. He had a boyhood fascination with machines, and after attending the parish school at St Anne's on the Sea, Lancashire, he gained an apprenticeship at the Empress motor works in 1909. For a period in 1911 he worked for Norman Crossland, one of the founders of the Manchester Aero Club. When an aero engine was sent to Manchester for repair, Alcock had the opportunity to return with it to Brooklands in Surrey, where he became mechanic to the French pilot Maurice Ducrocq. Taught to fly by Ducrocq, Alcock took his Royal Aero Club aviator's certificate (no. 368) at Brooklands in a Farman biplane on 26 November 1912. He was then employed by the Sunbeam motor-car company as a racing pilot, and regularly took part in races at Hendon. In July 1914 he competed against Harry Hawker and Frederick Raynham in a race from London to Manchester and back sponsored by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>.<br>
<br>In November 1914 Alcock joined the Royal Naval Air Service as a warrant officer instructor, serving mostly at the Royal Naval Flying School at Eastchurch, Kent. Although he received his commission as a flight sub-lieutenant in December 1915, and was anxious to see active service, his flying experience was so valuable that he was retained at Eastchurch for another year. Among the pilots whom he trained during his two years as an instructor was Reginald Alexander John Warneford, the first naval pilot to be awarded the Victoria Cross.<br>
<br>In December 1916 Alcock was posted to 2 wing, royal naval air station, in the eastern Mediterranean. From the allied base at Mudros on the island of Lemnos he took part in long-distance bombing raids on targets in Turkish territory and on German targets in Macedonia. On 30 September 1917, flying a single-seater Sopwith F1 Camel, he earned the Distinguished Service Cross for a brave and skilful attack on three German seaplanes, two of which crashed into the sea. At 8.15 p.m. on the same day he set out in a Handley Page 0/100 bomber to attack Constantinople. One of his two engines failed over the Gallipoli peninsula, forcing him to turn back. After covering 60 miles with only one engine, he ditched in the sea, near Suvla Bay, where he and his two crew members remained afloat in the craft for two hours. Their Very lights failed to attract the attention of British destroyers, and as the plane began to sink they swam ashore. After hiding overnight, they were captured by the Turks the following noon, and held prisoner at Seraskerat prison in Constantinople. Alcock was later moved to the prisoner-of-war camp for officers at Kedos in Anatolia.<br>
<br>At the time of his capture Jack Alcock had devised the single-seat Alcock Scout biplane, which consisted of components from the Sopwith Triplane, Pup, and, according to some accounts, the Sopwith Camel. Armed with a single Lewis gun, it was intended to be powered by either a 100 hp Monosoupape or 100 hp Clerget rotary motor. Its first flight was made in the hands of another pilot, since Alcock was held captive, although news of its success was smuggled to him in prison. It was afterwards operated by 2 wing at Mudros during 1917&#150;18.<br>
<br>Alcock was released by the Turks in September 1918 and reached London in December. He was passionate about flying and always hoped to do something outstanding. While imprisoned, he resolved to make an attempt to fly the Atlantic. In 1913 the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, whose proprietor, Lord Northcliffe, was keen to promote aviation, had offered a prize of &pound;10,000 to the first person to cross the Atlantic within seventy-two continuous hours. Competition was suspended during the war, but Northcliffe renewed the offer in July 1918; once hostilities ended in November, several manufacturers made plans to enter their aircraft. On demobilization in March 1919 Alcock approached the Vickers firm at Weybridge, who had considered entering their Vimy bomber (a twin-engined biplane powered by two Rolls-Royce 350 hp Eagle engines) but had not yet found a pilot. His enthusiasm quickly persuaded them to take up his proposition and work began on converting the Vimy for the long flight, replacing the bomb carriers with extra petrol tanks. Shortly afterwards a former Royal Flying Corps observer, Arthur Whitten Brown, was taken on as navigator, his first meeting with Alcock taking place in a hangar at Weybridge. Both were Mancunians by upbringing. Their shared determination to make the flight overcame marked differences in their personalities: Alcock, who was unmarried, was extrovert and sociable, with a boisterous sense of humour, while Brown, who was engaged, was quiet, nervous, and more intense. Together they tested the Vimy at Weybridge before leaving Southampton by sea on 4 May 1919 to join the other competitors assembled in Newfoundland to make the attempt from west to east (taking advantage of the prevailing winds). They arrived on 13 May, followed a fortnight later by the Vimy, which was transported in crates to be assembled and tested on site. &#145;Machine absolutely tophole&#146;, Alcock cabled to Vickers on 9 June after successfully completing the tests  (Wallace, 71).<br>
<br>By the end of May 1919 the Atlantic air crossing had become a matter of national prestige. A United States navy flying-boat, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Albert Cushing Read, left Newfoundland on 16 May and, after stopping off in the Azores for several days, reached Lisbon on 27 May, completing the stage-by-stage crossing in eleven days. Meanwhile an attempt at the non-stop crossing by Harry Hawker and Kenneth Mackenzie-Grieve ended when their Sopwith Atlantic ditched into the sea 500 miles off the Irish coast after the plane's engine overheated. Alcock and Brown continued their preparations, levelling an airfield, known as Lester's Field, near St John's, Newfoundland, in readiness for their attempt on the record.<br>
<br>Having eaten a final meal under the wings of the Vimy, loaded with 865 gallons of fuel, Alcock and Brown climbed into the cockpit at 16.00 Greenwich mean time (GMT) on Saturday 14 June 1919. Beneath his electrically heated flying suit Alcock wore a blue serge suit, Brown his Royal Flying Corps uniform. Two toy black cats, Twinkletoes and Lucky Jim, accompanied them as mascots. Seated side by side, Brown to port and Alcock, at the controls, to starboard, they took off at 16.13 and crossed the Newfoundland coast at 16.28. Their flight was beset by problems. The rupture of an inner exhaust pipe exposed them to the roar of the engines for most of the way, radio contact was lost, heavy cloud cover hindered navigation, and there was a continual danger of ice blocking the engines' air intakes and freezing the instrument gauges. Flying overnight, at one stage through a snowstorm, they crossed the coast of Ireland at 08.25 GMT the following morning and landed at 08.40 on what they took to be a field, but was in fact a marshy bog, at Clifden, Galway, where they were greeted by F. H. Teague, from the nearby Marconi wireless station. Coast to coast they flew 1890 miles in 15 hours 57 minutes at an average (wind-assisted) speed of 118.5 m.p.h., the actual journey from take-off to landing taking 16 hours 27 minutes.<br>
<br>At the Savoy hotel, on 20 June, Winston Churchill presented Alcock and Brown with the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>'s prize of &pound;10,000 for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. Northcliffe, who was unable through illness to attend the presentation, sent a message to Alcock: &#145;Your journey with your companion Whitten Brown is a typical example of British courage and organizing efficiency&#146;, and went on to hope that following the flight, &#145;The American and British people will understand each other better as they are brought into closer daily contact&#146;  (Wallace, 278&#150;9). On 21 June Alcock and Brown were received by George V at Windsor Castle and created KBE. Their Vimy aeroplane was brought back from Galway and presented to the nation by the manufacturers, Vickers and Rolls-Royce, to be exhibited in the Science Museum, South Kensington, London.<br>
<br>Alcock returned to Vickers at Weybridge as a staff pilot, testing and delivering new aircraft. On 18 December 1919 he set out to fly to Paris to deliver a Vickers Viking amphibian aeroplane which was to be shown off at the Aeronautical Exhibition. Flying solo (and therefore without a navigator) in fog, he came down at C&ocirc;te d'Evrard, about 25 miles from Rouen. The plane tipped onto its nose and Alcock was thrown forward, sustaining a fracture of the skull. He was taken to no. 6 general hospital, Rouen, where he died on the same day without regaining consciousness. His body was brought back to England and after a service at Manchester Cathedral was buried in the southern cemetery, Manchester, on 27 December.<br>
<br>Despite the publicity which their Atlantic crossing attracted, and the honours bestowed in its aftermath, Alcock and Brown's flight did not herald an immediate development of aerial traffic between Europe and North America. The significance of their feat began to be discounted. Writing in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> in 1927, Henry Albert Jones, the official air historian, suggested that &#145;the least eventful part&#146; of Alcock's flying career, his period as an instructor during the early years of the First World War, was &#145;the most fruitful&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). The Air Ministry, which was unenthusiastic about the newspaper-sponsored record-breaking attempts by commercial constructors, and gave no support to Alcock and Brown other than the loan of wireless and navigation equipment, preferred to develop airships as a safe and reliable means of long-distance air travel. In July 1919, less than a month after their flight, the Air Ministry's R34 airship, commanded by George Herbert Scott, accomplished the Atlantic crossing in both directions, though inevitably in a much slower time than Alcock and Brown had managed. No further successful Atlantic air crossing was achieved until the American Charles Lindbergh single-handedly flew a single-engine monoplane non-stop from New York to Paris in May 1927, and further losses of life on transatlantic crossings continued to cast doubt on the viability of heavier-than-air machines. Commercial flights across the Atlantic did not begin until twenty years after Alcock and Brown's record-breaking flight, and it was not until after the Second World War that their achievement was commemorated by a plaque near Lester's Field, Newfoundland, and by a statue at the foot of the control tower at London's Heathrow airport, erected at the suggestion of the aviator James Mollison, and unveiled in June 1954.<br>
