<span class="headword">Pavy,  Frederick William</span>  (1829&#150;1911), <span class="occ">physician and physiologist</span>, was born at Wroughton, Wiltshire, on 29 May 1829, the son of William Pavy, a maltster, and Mary, his wife. Educated at Merchant Taylors' School in Suffolk Lane, London, which he entered in January 1840, he experienced a spartan discipline under James Bellamy, the headmaster. He proceeded to Guy's Hospital in 1847, and matriculated at the University of London where he gained honours at the intermediate examination in medicine in 1850, and the scholarship and medal in materia medica and pharmaceutical chemistry. In 1852 he graduated MB with honours in physiology and comparative anatomy, obstetric medicine and surgery, and the medal in medicine.<br>
<br>Pavy then served as house surgeon and house physician at Guy's Hospital; in 1853 he graduated MD and went to Paris, where he joined the English Medical Society of Paris, of which he became a vice-president. The society met in a room near the Luxembourg Gardens and owned a small library. It was the rendezvous of the English medical students, where they met weekly to read papers and to report interesting cases. In Paris Pavy came under the influence of Claude Bernard, who was at this time giving a course of experimental lectures on the role and nature of glycogen and the phenomena of diabetes. Pavy made the study of diabetes the work of his life and imitated his master in the manner of his lectures.<br>
<br>On his return to England Pavy was appointed lecturer on anatomy at Guy's Hospital in 1854 and lecturer in physiology in 1856. He married Julia (1830?&#150;1902), daughter of William Oliver, on 25 July 1855. There were two daughters, both of whom predeceased him. His elder daughter, Florence Julia (1856&#150;1902), married in 1881 the Revd Sir Borradaile Savory, second baronet, son of Sir William Scovell Savory, first baronet.<br>
<br>Pavy lectured on comparative anatomy until 1864 and on physiology and microscopical anatomy until 1877; later he lectured on systematic medicine. He was elected assistant physician to the hospital in 1858, on the promotion of William Gull, and became full physician in 1871, when the number of physicians was increased from three to four. He was appointed consulting physician to the hospital in 1890, his tenure of office on the full staff having been prolonged for an additional year.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Physicians, Pavy was elected a fellow in 1860; he served as an examiner in 1872&#150;3 and in 1878&#150;9; he was a councillor from 1875 to 1877 and again from 1888 to 1890; and a censor in 1882, 1883, and 1891. He delivered the Goulstonian lectures in 1862&#150;3, the Croonian lectures in 1878 and 1894, and the Harveian oration in 1886. He was awarded the Baly medal in 1901.<br>
<br>Pavy also did good work at the medical societies of London. In 1860 he delivered the Lettsomian lectures at the Medical Society &#145;On certain points connected with diabetes&#146;. He served as president of the Pathological Society from 1893 to 1895 and as president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society from 1900 to 1902. He acted for some years as president of the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research, and from 1901 he served, after the death of Sir William MacCormac, as president of the national committee for Great Britain and Ireland of the International Congress of Medicine. The permanent committee of this congress, meeting at The Hague in 1909, appointed him the first chairman.<br>
<br>Pavy was elected FRS in 1863; the University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD in 1888, and in 1909 he was crowned laur&eacute;at of the Acad&eacute;mie de M&eacute;decine in Paris and received the Prix Godard for his physiological researches. On 26 June 1909, at a meeting held at Oxford of the Physiological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, he was presented with a silver bowl bearing an expression &#145;of affection and admiration&#146;.<br>
<br>Pavy was the last survivor of a line of distinguished physician&#150;chemists who did much to lay the foundations and advance the study of metabolic disorders; at the same time he ranks as a pioneer among nineteenth-century chemical pathologists. As a pupil of Claude Bernard, he recognized that all advances in the study of disease must rest on investigations into the normal processes of the body; but as his investigations proceeded, he found himself disagreeing with the views of his master. He soon discovered that Bernard's theory of the glycogenic function of the liver was based on faulty experiments and showed that the saccharine condition of the liver was due to post-mortem changes and was absent in the living animal. He also found that arterial and venous blood contained the same proportion of dextrose, indicating that dextrose did not pass from the liver to the tissues in the free state. Pavy also suggested that the kidney acts as a filter, allowing diffusible compounds such as urea and dextrose to pass from the blood into the urine. Hence, if free dextrose passed into the blood from the liver, as Bernard's theory suggested, the urine would provide evidence of the fact. Although he later found that glycogen was broken down by enzymes into dextrose and conveyed by the blood to the tissues, he maintained that the dextrose must be combined with blood proteins. He tested his new working hypotheses by experiment, but his theories did not always meet with the approval of those who were working along similar lines; some never obtained general acceptance. He made the study of carbohydrate metabolism the work of his life, and he was the founder of the modern theory of diabetes. In this connection his name was associated with many improvements in clinical and practical medicine. &#145;Pavy's test&#146;, using an ammoniacal copper salt for the quantitative estimation of reducing sugars, and his use of sugar tests and albumen tests in the solid form, made his name familiar to physicians and medical students throughout the world. As a practical physician, too, he was greatly interested in the control of diabetes through the diet. He introduced almonds and other protein-rich bread substitutes. His treatment of diabetes began with the elimination of dextrose from the blood by means of a carbohydrate-free diet. He was one of the first to recognize the importance of acetone and other ketones eliminated in acute stages of diabetes, and albuminaria, often associated with the disease, also interested him. He was the first to recognize cyclic, or physiological, albuminaria. He wrote a well-known book on dietetics, <span class="italic">A Treatise on Food and Dietetics Physiologically and Therapeutically Considered</span> (1873).<br>
<br>Throughout life Pavy remained a student, and even to the last week of his life he was at work in the laboratory which he had built at the back of his consulting room in Grosvenor Street. Quiet in bearing, gentle and courteous in speech, and with a somewhat old-fashioned formality of manner, he was generous in his benefactions. At Guy's medical school he built a well-equipped gymnasium and presented it to the students' union in 1890. He also left in his will an endowment for its upkeep.<br>
<br>Pavy died at his house, 35 Grosvenor Street, London, on 19 September 1911, and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
