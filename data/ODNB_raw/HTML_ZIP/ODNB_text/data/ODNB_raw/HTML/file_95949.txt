<span class="headword">M&uuml;nchhausen,  Gerlach Adolf  von</span>, Baron M&uuml;nchhausen in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1688&#150;1770), <span class="occ">politician and diplomat</span>, was born on 5 October 1688 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> in Berlin. He was the third son of Gerlach Heino von M&uuml;nchhausen (1652&#150;1710), who had been a courtier in Berlin, rising to the rank of master of horse before his retirement in 1689, and Katharina Sophie (1665&#150;1734), the daughter of Ernst Freidemann von Selmnitz and his wife, Anna Elisabeth von Werthern. M&uuml;nchhausen's parents were married in 1683; they had six sons and five daughters, including Gerlach Adolf's younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95948/', "Philipp Adolf von M&#252;nchhausen")</script>, a member of the Hanoverian ministry in London. Little is known of M&uuml;nchhausen's early education. He studied law at university, almost certainly with the intention of entering public service in one of the German states. He began his legal studies at the University of Jena in 1707 and three years later proceeded to Halle in a move that was then almost obligatory for a young protestant nobleman with ambitions for state service. M&uuml;nchhausen also concluded his studies in typical fashion, studying at a Dutch university&#151;Utrecht&#151;during 1711 and then travelling through the Netherlands and France.<br>
<br>M&uuml;nchhausen entered the legal service of the electorate of Saxony in 1714 but his stay in Dresden was brief. In May 1716 he was sworn as a councillor at the Hanoverian appeal court in Celle and remained in Hanoverian service for the rest of his career. In the previous year he had married Wilhelmine Sophie von Wangenheim (1701&#150;1750) at Straussfurt, near Erfurt, one of his family's estates; the couple had two sons who did not survive beyond infancy. M&uuml;nchhausen spent the early 1720s engaged in legal affairs but his broader political ambitions were emerging. In December 1724 he wrote to George I asking to replace Rudolf Johann, Baron von Wrisberg, as the Hanoverian representative at the imperial diet at Regensburg, Wrisberg's aggressively protestant outlook being increasingly regarded as a liability by the ministry in Hanover. M&uuml;nchhausen eventually replaced Wrisberg as Hanover's envoy in Regensburg in 1726. Tensions between Hanover and Austria were high at this point. M&uuml;nchhausen had to deal with the fallout from George I's failed attempt to influence the German princes by sending the British diplomat Isaac Le Heup to Regensburg. Le Heup, and his colleague in Vienna, Fran&ccedil;ois Louis de Pesme de Saint-Saphorin, were expelled in April 1727. The general crisis eased somewhat with George I's death in June 1727.<br>
<br>M&uuml;nchhausen's rise through the Hanoverian ministry continued under George II. He was appointed a privy councillor in January 1728. In 1732 he became <i>Grossvogt</i> in Celle&#151;the title was a legal one that brought more status than actual power. His initial area of responsibility within the Hanoverian ministry was for educational and ecclesiastical affairs, but he was ultimately to become the king's chief minister in his German lands. M&uuml;nchhausen's educational interests were visible in his determination to push forward the idea of founding a new university within the electoral territory of Hanover. The possession of a fully fledged university was seen as an important mark of status among the German princes, and M&uuml;nchhausen was therefore keen when the idea was mooted in 1732. The first lectures were held at the new institution in G&ouml;ttingen two years later. Divided into the four faculties of law, medicine, philosophy, and theology, the university was intended to promote enlightened principles; for example, the theological faculty had no right of censorship, although the state did retain that authority. M&uuml;nchhausen's hope was that the Georgia Augusta, dedicated to and named after his royal master, would replace Halle as the favoured institution for the nobility throughout the Holy Roman empire who sought preparation for state service. Consequently legal studies were strongly encouraged and G&ouml;ttingen rapidly acquired a reputation as an important centre for the study of international law. M&uuml;nchhausen was present for the formal inauguration of the university in 1737 and remained closely involved with it throughout his life, encouraging the formation of an academy of sciences in G&ouml;ttingen in 1751. Contemporaries noted that the initials in the university's name might just as easily stand for Gerlaco Adolphina as Georgia Augusta.<br>
<br>M&uuml;nchhausen's other domestic policies also yielded positive results. He was credited with improving agricultural productivity and thus tax revenues within Hanover. He also supported the foundation in 1735 of the state stud farm at Celle, which has continued to produce internationally renowned horses to the present day.<br>
<br>M&uuml;nchhausen's growing political importance can be seen from his various diplomatic missions from 1740. In June of that year he was sent by George II to Berlin to negotiate with the new Prussian monarch, Frederick II. After the frosty relations that had characterized Prusso-Hanoverian (and by extension Anglo-Prussian) relations during the reign of Frederick William I, George II's brother-in-law, George hoped that his nephew would be more amenable to co-operation. M&uuml;nchhausen found Frederick to be cultured and rather Francophile. He sought to warn Frederick of the dangers that excessive French power posed to the German states, a theme characteristic of both M&uuml;nchhausen and the Hanoverian ministry's general approach to foreign affairs. M&uuml;nchhausen was also the Hanoverian ambassador at two imperial elections, that of 1742, which selected the elector of Bavaria as Charles VII, and 1745, when Maria Theresa's husband, Francis Stephen of Lorraine, was elected Francis I.<br>
<br>The War of the Austrian Succession had reminded M&uuml;nchhausen of Hanover's vulnerability in the face of French aggression and how the connection with Britain might place Hanoverian territory at risk. The period after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) saw a blossoming of M&uuml;nchhausen's connections with British ministers. His younger brother Philipp had become head of the German chancery in London. The duke of Newcastle accompanied George II on his summer sojourn in the Hanoverian electorate for the first time in 1748. M&uuml;nchhausen won Newcastle's confidence and became a regular correspondent of the British minister. M&uuml;nchhausen was sceptical about Newcastle's attempts to secure a continuing alliance with Austria through the imperial election scheme, although he hoped that Newcastle might be able to persuade the Austrians to settle some of the protestant complaints that had built up in the imperial courts.<br>
<br>In 1753 M&uuml;nchhausen became president of the chamber and effective head of the ministry in Hanover. As relations between France and Britain deteriorated during the 1750s, M&uuml;nchhausen and his Hanoverian colleagues hoped that Hanover might be able to remain neutral. These hopes were dashed and M&uuml;nchhausen found himself having to negotiate with French occupiers after the defeat of allied forces at Hastenbeck in July 1757. The Hanoverian ministry retreated to Stade, although M&uuml;nchhausen remained in the city of Hanover long enough to ensure that he was not directly involved in the talks that led to the convention of Kloster-Zeven. Hanoverian fortunes revived in late 1757. The appointment of Ferdinand of Brunswick as commander of allied forces in Germany and Frederick II's victory at Rossbach revitalized hopes of active British and Hanoverian participation in the conflict. M&uuml;nchhausen was reluctant for Hanover to resume the fight. His relations with Ferdinand of Brunswick remained formal and he did not enjoy the intimacy with William Pitt that he had with Newcastle. He talked frequently about the need to secure peace, particularly after George II's death in 1760. The new king, George III, continued to place his faith in M&uuml;nchhausen, and in 1765 he was granted the title of premier minister, with the right to preside in all councils, except the legal chancery. M&uuml;nchhausen's first wife having died in October 1750, he married again on 10 January 1755 in Hanover. His second wife, Christiane Lucie von der Schulenburg (1718&#150;1787), was the daughter of a Prussian general, Achaz von der Schulenburg, and of Sophie Magdalena von M&uuml;nchhausen; she appears to have been M&uuml;nchhausen's niece. Gerlach Adolf von M&uuml;nchhausen died on 26 November 1770 and was buried in the Neust&auml;dter church, Hanover. Although he died childless, the University of G&ouml;ttingen ensured that his name was not forgotten. The most infamous member of the family, Hieronymus Karl Friedrich von M&uuml;nchhausen (1720&#150;1797), fictionalized by Rudolf Erich Raspe, was the son of Gerlach Adolf and Philipp Adolf's first cousin.<br>
