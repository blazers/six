<span class="headword">South, Sir  James</span>  (1785&#150;1867), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, born at Southwark, London, in October 1785, was the eldest son in the large family of James South (<i>d</i>. 1823), a prosperous dispensing chemist of High Street, Southwark, and his first wife, Sarah. His half-brother, from his father's second marriage, was the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26047/', "John Flint South")</script>. James studied surgery, became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and embarked on a profitable career; but his friendship with Joseph Huddart aroused his interest in astronomy, and he began observing with a 6 inch Gregorian reflector. His marriage, in 1816, to Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1851), the niece and sole heir of Joseph Ellis of South Lambeth, relieved him of the need to earn a living and allowed him to abandon his large surgical practice. He established an observatory attached to his house in Blackman Street, Borough, London, which he equipped with two equatorials of 5and 7 feet focal length respectively, besides a first-rate transit instrument by Troughton. Here, between 1821 and 1823, he observed, in collaboration with John Frederick William Herschel, 380 double stars. In presenting him with the gold medal of the Astronomical Society in 1826, Francis Baily spoke of his &#145;princely collection of instruments, such as have never yet fallen to the lot of a private individual&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society</span>, 2, 1826, 547).<br>
<br>In 1825 South took his 5 foot telescope to Passy, near Paris, where he came to know Humboldt and Arago, and convinced Laplace of the reality of orbiting double stars by visual demonstration. In only a few months there he carried out what Herschel called &#145;a noble series of measures&#146; on 458 compound stars, of which 160 were new; for this work, together with his paper &#145;On the discordances between the sun's observed and computed right ascensions&#146;, presented to the Royal Society on 8 June 1826, South was awarded the society's Copley medal in 1826. He had been elected a fellow of the society in 1821.<br>
<br>South was one of the founders of the Astronomical Society; he was elected president in 1829, and the royal charter granted to it in 1831 was made out in his name. By this time he was no longer president, however, and the confusion of formalities that resulted gave his enemy Richard Sheepshanks the opportunity to provoke the irascible South into behaviour that made his position in the society untenable. South withdrew, and became alienated from most of his early scientific friends.<br>
<br>South was by no means alone in regarding science in England as decadent, and he actively considered emigrating to France. Both governments saw him as a notable prize and competed for his favour, but the knighthood conferred on him on 21 July 1830 by William IV, and the civil-list pension of &pound;300 in aid of his astronomical researches that soon followed, persuaded him to remain in England.<br>
<br>In 1826 South equipped a splendid observatory on Campden Hill, Kensington, adding to his array of instruments an 8 foot achromatic, the transit circle used by Stephen Groombridge, and a clock presented by the king of Denmark. But he was handicapped in his friendly rivalry with Wilhelm Struve of Dorpat, Estonia, in the study of double stars by his lack of a large object-glass of high quality. Then, in 1829, he heard that a 12 inch object-glass by the great Paris optician Cauchoix was for sale. He hastened to Paris, paid the asking price of about &pound;1000, and returned in triumph with the lens.<br>
<br>The mounting he entrusted to Troughton, but the work, finished in 1831, proved a failure. South, bitterly disappointed, refused to pay; and Troughton, vigorously encouraged by Sheepshanks, brought an action. The matter was referred to arbitration, and there ensued a trial that involved almost every British astronomer of note. From 1834 to 1838 Sir William Henry Maule presided over the court; John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune acted as counsel for South, while Sheepshanks advised Troughton. In 1838 Maule gave judgment in favour of Troughton, whereupon South smashed the mounting in dispute, and sold the wood and iron by public auction in 1839 and the brass in 1842, on each occasion advertising the sale with scurrilous posters. The first sale resulted in a small loss, and the second in a profit of &pound;11 for South to set against the many thousands of pounds he had spent on the instrument and the ensuing legal costs. His mind had been well-nigh unhinged by the protracted episode. The 12 inch lens that had been the ruin of his astronomical career was eventually presented by him in 1862 to the observatory of Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>After 1838 South attempted only casual pieces of work, experimenting with clocks and pendulums, and executing at Watford in 1846 a series of observations on the disturbance, by passing railway trains, of star images reflected from mercury. They were reported to the government and presented in 1863 to the Royal Society. South observed Encke's comet in 1828 and 1838, Mauvais's comet in 1844, and Vico's in 1845. He was a friend and confidant of William Parsons, third earl of Rosse, and in February 1845 had the privilege, with Thomas Romney Robinson of Armagh, of trying the performance of Rosse's 6 foot reflector, by far the largest telescope ever built. The impetuous Robinson made exaggerated public claims for the scientific implications of what the instrument revealed, which he regarded as a triumph for Irish astronomy, and South found himself in the unaccustomed role of restraining influence. He was a member of a number of scientific academies, including those of St Petersburg and Brussels, and in 1863 he received an honorary LLD from the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>In two papers, presented to the Royal Society on 16 June 1831 and 13 December 1832, South detailed observations of Mars that showed a complete absence of planetary atmospheric effects. He published a number of astronomical papers in later life, but these were of a minor nature. He was a frequent contributor, at times acrimoniously, to the daily and weekly press, and was the author of a number of critical pamphlets. In one, published in 1822, he pointed out defects in the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span>, and he presided over a committee of the Astronomical Society appointed in 1829 to find ways of bringing the publication up to standard. He took a prominent role in attempts to make the membership of the Royal Society more professional, but his <span class="italic">Thirty-Six Charges Against the President and Council of the Royal Society</span>, printed as a tract in 1830, were officially ignored, notwithstanding his protest at a stormy meeting of the society. His feud with Sheepshanks led him to join with Charles Babbage, another of Sheepshanks's victims, in 1852 in a successful attempt to embarrass Sheepshanks over a youthful customs deception of his that had come to light. Sheepshanks was defended by his ally the astronomer royal, George Biddell Airy, and when Airy renewed his defence in an obituary, published after Sheepshanks's death in 1855, South defied convention by pursuing his adversary beyond the grave in a printed rejoinder.<br>
<br>During his later years South became partially blind and deaf. He died at his home at Observatory, Campden Hill, on 19 October 1867. His instruments were sold on 4 August 1870.<br>
