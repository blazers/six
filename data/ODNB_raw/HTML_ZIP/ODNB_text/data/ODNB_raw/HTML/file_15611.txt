</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kinglake,  Alexander William</span>  (1809&#150;1891), <span class="occ">historian and travel writer</span>, was born on 5 August 1809, in Taunton, Somerset, the eldest son of William Kinglake (<i>d</i>. 1852), banker and solicitor, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of Thomas Woodforde from Castle Cary. He was one of four sons and two daughters who survived to adulthood. The Kinglakes were descended from the Scottish Kinlochs, who had migrated to England under James I and Anglicized their name. Alexander William, known as Alec to his family, did not grow tall, had a pallid complexion and was short-sighted. Taught to read by his mother, he developed a lasting love of Homer, and in childhood also became a proficient horseman. Through his grandfather, the family inherited Saltmoor, in Somerset, where Kinglake became lord of the manor on his father's death. At the age of twelve, he went to board with the Revd George Coleridge at Ottery St Mary in Devon, which Kinglake considered &#145;a sad intellectual fall&#146; from his mother's tuition. Between April 1823 and July 1828, he happily attended Eton College, where he became a good oarsman and swimmer. His one regret was that myopia denied him a military career. After Eton, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where Alfred Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, and William Makepeace Thackeray were contemporaries. He spoke in union debates and seemed perpetually short of money, but secured a BA in 1832, and an MA four years later. After Cambridge, he entered Lincoln's Inn on 14 April 1832 and studied law under Bryan Procter (whose wife Anne's literary circle included Thomas Carlyle) and visited Wales and France to reveal an early taste for travel.<br>
<br>In August 1834, Kinglake set out on an eighteen-month odyssey through Europe and the Ottoman empire. After encountering plague in Constantinople, he travelled to Smyrna, Cyprus, Beirut, the Holy Land, and Jerusalem, before crossing the Sinai Desert to Cairo. Following three weeks in Egypt, he returned north through Damascus and Asia Minor then via Athens, Corfu, Rome, and Turin to London. On 5 May 1837, Kinglake was called to the bar but did not enjoy a distinguished legal career. He continued to travel, visiting Switzerland in 1843, and the following year <span class="italic">Eothen</span>, his account of the 1834&#150;5 Turkish adventures, was published and included two of his own watercolours. Leslie Stephen wrote of <span class="italic">Eothen</span> in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>: &#145;though the book was rather absurdly compared with the ordinary records of travel, it is more akin to Sterne's <span class="italic">Sentimental Journey</span>, and is a delightful record of personal impressions rather than outward facts&#146;. Soon after <span class="italic">Eothen</span>, two articles appeared in <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>: &#145;Rights of women&#146; (December 1844) and &#145;The Mediterranean a French lake&#146; (March 1845). Kinglake became a member of the Travellers' Club in 1845 and, eight years later, of the Athenaeum.<br>
<br>From August until October 1845, Kinglake travelled in Algeria, where he met Colonel A. J. L. de St Arnaud and heard about Colonel A. J. J. P&eacute;lissier, who would each command the French forces in the Crimea and were currently suppressing rebel tribesmen. Back in London, Kinglake resumed a busy social life. The writer Mrs M. C. M. Simpson recorded that &#145;he was exceedingly courteous to women and very generous to all who needed help&#146;  (de Gaury, 88). Although not musical he entertained Caroline Norton at the opera, and allegedly vied with the exiled Louis Napoleon (later Napoleon III) for the same mistress, the wealthy courtesan and self-styled Miss Howard (Elizabeth Ann Maryett). In February 1846, he crossed to Calais for a duel with Edward Marlborough FitzGerald, which failed to take place. The high point of his many travels occurred in 1854. Kinglake went with John Delane, editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and A. H. Layard MP to Constantinople and on to join the invasion fleet off the Crimean coast on 10 September 1854. After the military landing, he went ashore, witnessed the battle of the Alma from close hand, dined that night with Lord Raglan (commander of the British army, whom he had met riding with the duke of Beaufort's hounds in 1853), helped the wounded, sketched and recorded the scenes in his diary. Kinglake rode with the allies towards Sevastopol and watched them take up siege positions on upland to the south. From there, he saw the charges of the heavy and light brigades on 25 October near Balaklava, though soon afterwards he was invalided back to England.<br>
<br>In 1852 Kinglake had failed to enter parliament, but five years later he secured election for Bridgwater, as a Liberal. He spoke frequently in the house, but made little impact due to his weak voice and unimpressive demeanour, although he successfully took up the case of British engineers unjustly gaoled in Naples, gaining for them release and compensation. In 1869 he was unseated after bribery involving his election agent. He then concentrated on his massive work <span class="italic">The Invasion of the Crimea</span>, which would cover eight volumes, the first published in 1863, the last in 1887. Kinglake had been granted unlimited access to Lord Raglan's papers by his widow, consulted French, Russian, and Turkish sources, and corresponded and interviewed exhaustively. He returned to the Crimea, hosted by the Russian engineer Todleben, who had so ably defended Sevastopol. But Kinglake's diligence, which delayed completion of the story until a generation after the war, frustrated readers and subjected him to repeated and tiresome letters from individuals like Lord Cardigan, who were determined to see their version of events in print. Inevitably, there were criticisms, not least because Kinglake's anti-French bias showed through. Nevertheless, W. G. Romaine, judge-advocate in the Crimea, wrote: &#145;For once the world is agreed and welcomes your work with a chorus of praise&#146;; and Sir Robert Morier whimsically observed: &#145;It is a noble monument &hellip; one singularly typical of the imbecility and heroism which make up the British character&#146;  (de Gaury, 131&#150;2).<br>
<br>During the work's gestation, Kinglake published, anonymously, in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (September 1872) &#145;The life of Madame de La Fayette&#146;. He still rode frequently in Rotten Row when over seventy. Towards the end of his life, he engaged in prolonged correspondence with Olga Novikov, god-daughter of the tsar, and also the Turkish playwright, Augusta Persee, wife of Sir William Gregory, under whose influence he subscribed to the defence of the Egyptian nationalist leader, Arabi Pasha. Kinglake dined regularly at the Travellers' and Athenaeum, despite increasing deafness, which made conversation difficult. In his eightieth year, on doctor's advice, he forsook the clubs, as gout and throat cancer took their toll. He died on 1 January 1891 at his home, 17 Bayswater Terrace, London, and was cremated at Woking, following a service in Christ Church, Lancaster Gate. His ashes were placed near family graves at Pitminster church, Somerset. Although Kinglake lived in rented rooms, he owned the manorial lands at Saltmoor, which were left to two nieces, as he had remained unmarried. The rents were allocated as annuities to certain friends and retainers, and provision was made for the nurse, Alice Dumper, who cared for him during his last days. His collection of books, oriental swords, and other artefacts was distributed among friends.<br>
<br>Janet Ross, daughter of a long-standing acquaintance, wrote about &#145;that marvellous mixture of pride, of humility, of daring and intense shyness&#146;, and Kinglake himself admitted that, &#145;I have all my life suffered from constitutional shyness&#146;  (de Gaury, 146, 128). He also chided Olga Novikov, &#145;pray remember that I am a heathen&#146;  (ibid., 135), reinforcing Thackeray's post-Cambridge conclusion that Kinglake was an atheist.<br>
