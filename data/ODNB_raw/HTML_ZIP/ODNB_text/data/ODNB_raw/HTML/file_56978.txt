<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oberon,  Merle</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Estelle Merle O'Brien Thompson]</span>  (1911&#150;1979), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Bombay, India, on 19 February 1911; she was baptized on 16 March at Emmanuel Church, Gorpori, Bombay, the daughter of Arthur Thompson, a British-born railway engineer, and his Ceylonese wife, Constance  (BL OIOC, N/3/105, fol. 27). Oberon's dark beauty, her inheritance from her mother, was an embarrassment in her search for a successful career in films in colour-conscious America. For many years her mother travelled and lived with Oberon, but was always referred to as her maid.<br>
<br>After probably being educated in India, Oberon surfaced in London at the age of seventeen, under the name of Queenie O'Brien, working as a caf&eacute; hostess, and as an extra in British films. She graduated to playing small parts under the name of Estelle Thompson, although this aspect of her career is again open to question as she later admitted having invented several credits, &#145;to make myself appear more interesting&#146;  (Shipman, 425). During this period, she was spotted by the film director Alexander Korda, who added further touches to her grooming as a film star, including the name by which she is known.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s, after playing a variety of small roles, including a harem girl in the Crazy Gang's <span class="italic">Alf's Button</span> (1930) and several temptresses and &#145;other women&#146;, a type of role she found it hard to escape in her early career, she graduated to playing leading roles in British films. A significant moment was when Alexander Korda cast her as Anne Boleyn in <span class="italic">The Private Life of Henry VIII</span>, starring Charles Laughton, in 1933. Literary figures also became an area of casting for which her beauty, poise, and unforced photogenic attraction seemed to suit her. She had a compelling presence on the screen but brought no idiosyncratic features, which made her a malleable persona which a strong director could fashion as he wished. She was taken to Hollywood by Korda, who sold part of her contract to Sam Goldwyn. Throughout the 1930s she commuted between London and Hollywood, from success to success. She was nominated for an Academy award for her role as Kitty Vane in <span class="italic">Dark Angel</span> (1935), a melodrama, in which, for once, she played the central role in a love triangle; the story cast her as the fianc&eacute;e of a blinded war hero who tries to persuade her to marry his best friend without her discovering his condition.<br>
<br>As well as in Hollywood films with largely contemporary settings, Oberon continued during the 1930s to appear in British period films, often with literary settings. After Anne Boleyn she appeared as Antonia, supporting Douglas Fairbanks senior as an ageing philanderer, in <span class="italic">The Private Life of Don Juan</span> (1934) and as Marguerite Balcony, supporting Leslie Howard, in <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span> (1935). In 1937 she starred in Korda's most ambitious project, a film version of <span class="italic">I, Claudius</span>, with Charles Laughton in the leading role. During the filming Oberon was involved in a near fatal car crash, which miraculously left her beauty intact, but which led to the film's being cancelled. After some mediocre films, in Britain and Hollywood, she returned to major projects as Cathy, partnered by Laurence Olivier, in <span class="italic">Wuthering Heights</span> (1939). In this she looked beautiful and posed romantically, but never reached the emotional complexity of the character. Her performances always displayed a sense of style and polish, which led to her being cast in more historical roles or period melodramas. She appeared, and narrowly escaped being a victim of Jack the Ripper, in <span class="italic">The Lodger</span> (1944), in which she had to dance the cancan twice, or, as one critic commented, the &#145;can't-can't&#146;  (Shipman, 426). She appeared as Georges Sand in <span class="italic">A Song to Remember</span> (1945), a film which well deserves to be remembered as the worst biographical film ever; the dialogue included the line &#145;Chopin, I want you to meet Franz Liszt&#146;. She played the Empress Josephine in <span class="italic">Desir&eacute;e</span> (1954) and Sigmund Romberg's lyric writer Dorothy Donnelly in <span class="italic">Deep in my Heart</span> (1954). Along with these were a string of comedies and lachrymose romances that are best forgotten, some of which never rose above B-feature distribution. She continued to be a star, but rarely in star vehicles. Late in her career she had several roles in which her beauty, poise, and age combined to make her suitable to play fading stars and aristocrats. In two of these films her performance significantly raised inferior material to a superior level: <span class="italic">The Oscar</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">Hotel</span> (1966).<br>
<br>On 3 June 1939 Oberon married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34362/', "Alexander Korda (1893&#150;1956)")</script>, divorcing him in 1945 to marry Lucien Ballard, a film cameraman. That marriage ended in divorce in 1949. Her third husband, from 1957, was Bruno Pagliai, a wealthy industrialist, with whom she lived in Mexico, largely suppressing her film career to live as a wealthy socialite. When the marriage ended in divorce in 1973 it left Oberon a rich woman. She had no children of her own, but adopted two children, Bruno junior and Francesca, during her marriage to Bruno Pagliai.<br>
<br>Throughout her film career Oberon worked with prestigious directors (including Korda, Ernst Lubitsch, Ren&eacute; Clair, Jules Duvivier, King Vidor, and William Wyler), though not necessarily in their best pictures. The leading men who played opposite her included Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, Douglas Fairbanks senior, Leslie Howard, Laurence Olivier, George Sanders, and Marlon Brando. Academy awards eluded her, but her dark beauty and svelte appearance added distinction and star quality to the films in which she appeared. In this, she complemented the more outstanding talent of the actors who played opposite her, and provided a fitting and enhancing setting for the display of their talents. There was a smouldering energy beneath her poised appearance which threatened to break loose from all control; it never did, but it attracted and sustained the cinema audience's attention. In 1973, the year of her divorce from Bruno Pagliai, she made a comeback in <span class="italic">Interval</span>, in which she starred and was also the producer. The film followed the story of a young man, played by Robert Wolders, who falls in love with an ageing star, played by Oberon. Ironically, she later married Wolders in 1975. From then on, she retired from films and she and Wolders entertained high society lavishly. Oberon died of a stroke, aged sixty-eight, in Los Angeles, on 23 November 1979. She was survived by Wolders.<br>
