<span class="headword">Heygate,  William Edward</span>  (1816&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born on 11 August 1816 at Hackney, Middlesex, the second son of James Heygate (1784&#150;1873) and his wife, Anna (<i>d</i>. 1867), second daughter of Edward Longdon Mackmurdo of Old Ford, Middlesex. He had two brothers and three sisters. Sir William Heygate (1782&#150;1844), MP for Sudbury 1818&#150;26 and lord mayor of London 1822&#150;3, created baronet in 1831, was Heygate's only uncle on his father's side. He entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1831, and matriculated as Andrew's exhibitioner at St John's College, Oxford, in 1835. Taking a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, he graduated BA in 1839 and MA in 1842.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon and then priest in 1840, Heygate went first as curate to Great Wakering, Essex, before being invalided for two years with chest problems. He then served curacies at South Gerrans in Cornwall, and at Hadleigh and Leigh, both in Essex, supplementing mostly meagre stipends by teaching and writing. On 15 July 1846 he married Mary Elizabeth Penny, daughter of the Revd Edmund Henry Penny, rector of Great Stambridge, Rochford, Essex. They had seven sons and four daughters. In 1869, reputedly after John Keble had commended him to Gladstone as a parish priest deserving of promotion, Heygate was presented to the living of Brighstone (or Brixton) on the Isle of Wight by Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Winchester.<br>
<br>A voluminous writer, Heygate was perhaps best known for his fiction, which contributed to the canon of high-church religious and social tales popularized by the Tractarian writers William Gresley and Francis Edward Paget. Typical of these was <span class="italic">William Blake, or, The English Farmer</span> (1848), which set out the paternal responsibilities of that class, while <span class="italic">Godfrey Davenant: a Tale of School Life</span> (1847) and <span class="italic">Godfrey Davenant at College</span> (1849), which chronicled the early moral trials of their protagonist and set out Heygate's educational ideals, also enjoyed some notice. <span class="italic">Sir Henry Appleton, or, Essex during the Great Rebellion</span> (1857) drew upon Heygate's local historical knowledge and evinced hostility to puritanism, while a better received sequel, <span class="italic">The Scholar and the Trooper, or, Oxford during the Great Rebellion</span>, appeared the following year. The first of these led to a correspondence with the prominent American manufacturer, banker, and politician Nathan Appleton (1779&#150;1861), a distant descendant of the book's subject who claimed puritan ancestry. Their dialogue was published anonymously in the USA in 1859 as <span class="italic">The Doctrines of Original Sin and the Trinity Discussed in a Correspondence</span>. Two anti-revolutionary novellas were <span class="italic">Pierre Poussin, or, The Thought of Christ's Presence</span> (1851) and the anonymous <span class="italic">Alice of Fobbing, or, The Times of Jack Straw and Wat Tyler</span> (1860). As well as various individual tales Heygate published eight collections of children's stories, of which <span class="italic">Allegories and Tales</span> (1873) and <span class="italic">An Old Parson's Anecdotes and Tales</span> (1892) are typical. A collection of his poetry, <span class="italic">The Fugitive and other Poems</span>, appeared in 1870.<br>
<br>Heygate also published numerous devotional works. Well-known general guides included <span class="italic">Ember Hours</span> (1857), <span class="italic">The Good Shepherd</span> (1860) (which W. E. Gladstone used to read while dressing for dinner), and <span class="italic">The Eucharist</span> (1874), though others were intended for specific audiences, such as <span class="italic">The Manual: a Book of Devotion Chiefly Intended for the Poor</span> (1853) and <span class="italic">The Evening of Life, or, Meditations and Devotions for the Aged</span> (1856). He issued several statements of theology, such as <span class="italic">Catholic Antidotes</span> (1858), as well as a collection of sermons and various pamphlets on subjects of the day.<br>
<br>Made an honorary canon of Winchester in 1887, Heygate remained at Brighstone until his death there on 12 December 1902; he was buried in Brighstone churchyard. An ardent high-churchman and Tractarian sympathizer, he volunteered to assist the Revd Bryan King, rector of St George-in-the-East, London, during the ritualist riots of 1859&#150;60, and was a lifelong friend and correspondent both of Keble and, after his settlement at Brighstone, of E. B. Pusey, who had a house at nearby Chale. Of his immediate family, his younger brother Thomas Edmund (<i>b</i>. 1826) and three of his seven sons&#151;the eldest, William Augustine (<i>b</i>. 1847), the third, Ambrose (<i>b</i>. 1852), and the fifth, Reginald Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1858)&#151;all followed him into Anglican orders.<br>
