<span class="headword">Maxwell,  Robert</span>, first earl of Nithsdale  (<em>b. </em>after 1586, <em>d.</em> 1646), <span class="occ">politician and diplomat</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18404/', "John Maxwell, eighth Lord Maxwell (1553&#150;1593)")</script>, and Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1637), daughter of David Douglas, earl of Angus. Nothing is known of his early life or education. In May 1612 the fugitive status of his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18405/', "John Maxwell, ninth Lord Maxwell (b. in or before 1586, d. 1613)")</script>, led to his own warding in Edinburgh, where the Scottish privy council allowed him 100 merks per month until his release on 26 May 1613, following John's execution; having been known from 1607 as the master of Maxwell, he was now referred to as the Hon. Robert Maxwell of Caerlaverock. By 1612, the Maxwell territories encompassed the 6 merk land of Capenoch, Keri barony, Hollywood parish in Dumfries, and Keri mill, to which was added Castlegour in Kirkcudbright (16 July). As his father's heir, Maxwell received the barony of Caerlaverock in August 1615, and was able to secure his ancestral lands by a parliamentary act of rehabilitation (28 June 1617), and the reassignment of Langholm barony and the living of Maxwell by royal charter of 19 September 1621.<br>
<br>Maxwell's status as a border magnate was confirmed on 18 December 1617 when he accepted responsibility for his tenants in accordance with the general band of 1602. His profile was extended by his appointment as border commissioner on 4 April 1618, and his instatement as tenth Lord Maxwell on 5 October. As a mark of the royal favour he now enjoyed, the king granted him a special disbursement of &pound;24,000 Scots (&pound;2000 sterling). His new ascendancy was confirmed by his inclusion on the Scottish privy council on 27 March 1619, and enhanced by his marriage on 28 October 1619, at St Mary-le-Strand, London, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1671), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont and cousin of George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham. On 29 August 1620 he was created earl of Nithsdale, a title that caused controversy among the Scottish nobles, its precedence being based on his father's creation as earl of Morton in 1581.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1621 Nithsdale sat in the House of Lords as a member for the committee to raise funds for British defence and for the dowry of Princess Elizabeth. He later served as one of the lords of the articles on 25 July, and on 4 August voted in favour of ratifying the five articles of Perth. On 1 April the earl was appointed a commissioner to monitor the waters of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Annandale and prevent the fishing of &#145;red fish, smolts, and fry&#146; out of season  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1st ser., 12.640). This assignment coincided with his activities as a border triumvir, which allowed him special justiciary powers, yet his authority was challenged when the Johnstones&#151;traditional enemies of the Maxwells&#151;secured temporary exemption from his jurisdiction. On 17 June 1623, however, he and James Johnstone of Westray were publicly reconciled, with the latter agreeing in principle to Nithsdale's authority. It was during this period that the earl initiated construction on Caerlaverock, the Solway stronghold that had belonged to the Maxwell family since the early thirteenth century. He introduced a number of intricate architectural innovations, creating new classically styled ranges for the eastern and southern portions of the castle courtyard and embedding the Maxwell and Beaumont crests in Ionic columns along the eastern range. This ambitious building, thought to have been inspired by the prospect of a royal visit to Dumfriesshire, helped create Nithsdale's crushing debt difficulties.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1624 the king granted Nithsdale a special licence to travel in France, ordering his creditors not to take advantage of his absence. By 7 September he was in Italy on a mission to secure papal dispensation for the marriage of Prince Charles and Henrietta Maria of France. A severe illness confined him to Florence until the end of October, when he recovered sufficient strength to travel to Rome, returning to Britain early in January 1625. After the death of King James, helped by his friendship with his wife's cousin the duke of Buckingham, Nithsdale continued to receive favourable treatment from Charles I, on whose behalf he returned to Scotland as a collector-general of taxes for the convention of estates in October 1625. On 22 October that year the king granted him a special six-month protection &#145;contra creditores&#146;, indicating that his financial difficulties had not yet been resolved  (<span class="italic">Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum</span>, 1620&#150;33, 318, no. 883).<br>
<br>In 1627 Nithsdale resumed his European profile when, on 28 February, the king ordered him to raise 3000 Scottish soldiers in Lower Saxony for Christian IV of Denmark. However, his personal unpopularity within the Scottish privy council, combined with his personal arrogance and steadfast Catholicism, made recruitment difficult. Nithsdale wrote to Charles in May requesting renewed protection for his sureties during his proposed expedition to Germany, from which he would return by 23 February 1628. On this date he was in Scotland, demonstrating his loyalty to Charles by surrendering his lordship of erection. By December he had entered into diplomatic correspondence with Cardinal Richelieu, with whom he exchanged professions of amity between the British and French crowns.<br>
<br>On 12 January 1633 Nithsdale resumed his role as border commissioner, and on 18 June appeared in parliament at Edinburgh. By 1638 he had fortified Caerlaverock Castle to prepare for the ensuing struggle between the king and the covenanters, though he himself was forced to shelter in Carlisle until a peace was concluded in June 1639. This agreement soon deteriorated, and on 27 March 1640 Charles secretly urged Nithsdale to garrison his castles. Caerlaverock was itself besieged from 29 June, until the earl's surrender of 26 September to Lieutenant-Colonel Home, whose subsequent misuse of both it and Castle Threave led Nithsdale to complain to the king in November 1641. On 22 June 1643 the convention of estates accused him of treason and seized his estates, then valued at &pound;3000 per annum. After launching an attack on Dumfries with Montrose on 15 April 1644, Nithsdale was excommunicated by the general assembly (23 June). His final major act was to accompany General Digby with 1500 horse in a march on Doncaster (1646), a venture that was successfully blocked by parliamentary forces. After regrouping at Skipton, Nithsdale escaped to the Isle of Man, where he died in May 1646. His wife, who survived him, died in 1671. They had two daughters, Jean (<i>d</i>. 1649) and Elizabeth, and one son, Robert (1620&#150;1677), who succeeded as second earl of Nithsdale.<br>
