<span class="headword">Walsh,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Ossory</span>, was the son of Patrick Walsh (<i>d</i>. 1578), Church of Ireland bishop of Waterford and Lismore from 1551. His son Nicholas was born in the city of Waterford. He spent time in the universities of Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge and was granted the degree of BA by the senate of the University of Cambridge in 1562/3 on the grounds of his having kept twelve terms of residence at these universities. He was granted an MA in 1567. In 1571 he was made chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.<br>
<br>There is evidence that Walsh was recommended for the bishopric of Kilmacduagh in 1572, but that he declined the appointment. In February 1578 he became bishop of Ossory. He was a conscientious bishop; he attempted to enforce the law against recusants and his contemporary, Sir Henry Wallop, said that he &#145;was the only man of his coat, that I ever knew born in [Ireland], that did most sincerely know and teach the Gospel&#146;.<br>
<br>Walsh was probably tall and thin for he refers to himself as &#145;Nicholas the Scar[e]crowe&#146;. He was the author of a collection of sermons in Latin and was also involved in the translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into Irish. This was a collaborative effort, initially involving Walsh, Nehemiah Donellan, and John Kearney, an associate of Walsh since their days in Cambridge together. Walsh's contribution to the translation began about 1573 while he and Kearney were both in St Patrick's Cathedral. While in Dublin Walsh and Kearney were instrumental in introducing Gaelic type into Ireland. The Irish <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was finally published by William Daniel in 1602 or 1603.<br>
<br>Bishop Walsh seems always to have been short of funds. In April 1581 he begged that he be allowed to hold <i>in commendam</i> any benefices in his diocese that might become vacant. Otherwise, he claimed, he would have to vacate the bishopric for lack of money. On 14 December 1585 Walsh was stabbed to death in his own house in Kilkenny by James Dullard, &#145;a profligate wretch&#146; whom he had cited in his consistory court for adultery; it was said that Dullard killed the bishop in order to prevent the case going any further. At the time Walsh was also engaged in proceedings to recover the properties of his see. Walsh was buried on the south side of the great aisle of Kilkenny Cathedral, where a monument was erected to him. Dullard was hanged.<br>
