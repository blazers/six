<span class="headword">Grey,  Richard</span>, third earl of Kent  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1478, <em>d.</em> 1524), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11532/', "George Grey, second earl of Kent")</script>, and his first wife, Anne Bourchier, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodville (<i>d</i>. 1489). Aged at least twenty-five when he succeeded his father in 1503, he wasted his family's fortunes&#151;possibly, as Dugdale says, he was a gambler. In a striking series of alienations he gave away or sold most of the lands, principally in Bedfordshire, that he had inherited: the beneficiaries were Henry VII's administrator&#150;courtiers, Charles Somerset, Baron Herbert (later earl of Worcester), Sir John Hussey (Kent's brother-in-law), Sir Richard Empson, Sir Henry Wyatt, and Giles, Baron Daubeney. The earl also fell quickly into debt to the king: he failed to pay livery for his father's lands, and he was fined 2500 marks for abducting Elizabeth Trussell, whose wardship the second earl had left to Richard's half-brother Henry; he then failed to keep up the instalments laid down for the payment of the fine.<br>
<br>An indenture of 6 May 1507 acknowledged the recovery to the king's use of several manors, to be held by the crown until these debts were paid, as Earl Richard was &#145;not of power, habilite ne havyour to content and pay to our seid sovereign lorde the seide sommes of money &hellip; without in manner his utter doing&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 368/290, rots. xlviii&#150;l). On 19 August 1507, moreover, Kent was bound in recognizance of &pound;10,000 not to sell, lease, or grant any of his lands without the king's consent, and he was to attend on the king &#145;soo that he bee see daily ones in the day within the kinges house&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR</span>, <i>1500&#150;09</i>, no. 797). Rather than reflecting the rapaciousness of the king, still less the shrewdness of a nobleman seeking to escape from the constraints of an entail, these transactions are best seen as an attempt by Henry VII&#151;moved by &#145;pitie&#146;, as Henry Grey would later claim  (Bedfordshire and Luton Archives and Record Service, L 24/530)&#151;to preserve a nobleman's patrimony from destruction. But no permanent restrictions were placed on Earl Richard's ability to dispose of his inheritance, and the sequence of alienations continued after the death of Henry VII, with courtiers such as Sir William Compton prominent among the beneficiaries. By the time he died, at London, on 3 May 1524, Earl Richard, who was variously described as &#145;as unmeet to governe his estate as a naturall Ideott&#146;, &#145;a praye sett open to the spoyle of all men&#146;, and leading an &#145;unstayed and disordered lyffe&#146;, had wrecked his inheritance  (ibid., L 24/525; 24/530, fol. 1<i>v</i>; DD OR 1064, fol. 9). He was buried at Whitefriars, London.<br>
<br>Although Henry VII appointed him to the Order of the Garter in 1505 (the highest honour at the king's disposal), Earl Richard played no visible role in the government and politics of the realm. He did, however, attend on some ceremonial and diplomatic occasions, such as the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520 and the reception of the emperor Charles V on his visit to England in 1522, and he served, too, on the French campaign of 1513, albeit in a subordinate role. He was also something of a literary patron, if in a small way. Alexander Barclay's <span class="italic">Myrrour of Good Maners</span> is said to have been printed in 1520 at the instance of the earl, who similarly promoted Brian Anslay's translation from Christine de Pisan, <span class="italic">Boke of the Cyte of Ladyes</span> (1521). Earl Richard married twice. His first wife, whom he married <i>c</i>.1506, was Elisabeth Hussey, sister of the courtier Sir John (later first Baron) Hussey; she died in 1516, and under a contract of 23 January 1521 he married Mrs Margaret Dawes (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fynche, formerly Curteys), the widow of a London alderman, who lived until 1540 or 1541. There were no children of either marriage. His heir was his despised half-brother Henry, whose hopes of taking up the title of earl of Kent and recovering the family manors were not realized.<br>
