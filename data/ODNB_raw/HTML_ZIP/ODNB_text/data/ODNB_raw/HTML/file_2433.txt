<span class="headword">Birch, Sir  Richard James Holwell</span>  (1803&#150;1875), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, came of a well-known Anglo-Indian family, and was the son of Richard Comyns Birch, Bengal civil service, and his wife, Frances Jane, daughter of William Rider, sheriff of Calcutta; he was a grandson of John Zephaniah Holwell, Bengal civil service (author of the famous account of his sufferings in the Black Hole of Calcutta). Birch was born in Calcutta on 26 January 1803 and educated at Cheam School, Surrey (under the Revd James Wilding). He received a commission as an ensign in the 26th Bengal native infantry in January 1821, and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1823&#150;4 before resuming his army career. His numerous relations in India ensured his rapid promotion and almost continuous service on the staff. He married at Delhi on 2 November 1831 Elizabeth Cuninghame, daughter of Sir Jeremiah Bryant (1783&#150;1845).<br>
<br>After acting as deputy judge-advocate-general at Meerut, and as assistant secretary in the military department at Calcutta, Birch was appointed judge-advocate-general to the forces in Bengal in 1841. In this capacity he accompanied the army in the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845&#150;6), was mentioned in dispatches, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel. In the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1849) he was appointed to the temporary command of a brigade after the battle of Chilianwala. He distinguished himself at the battle of Gujrat and was made a CB in 1849; he continued to serve as brigadier-general in Sir Colin Campbell's campaign in the Kohat Pass in 1850. He then reverted to his appointment at headquarters, and in 1852 received the important post of secretary to the Indian government in the military department. He was promoted colonel in 1854, major-general in May 1858, and still held the secretaryship when the Indian mutiny broke out in 1857. His services at this time were most valuable, though he never left Calcutta, for his thorough knowledge of the duties of his office and his long official experience enabled him to give valuable advice to Lord Canning, the governor-general, and to Sir Colin Campbell when he arrived to become commander-in-chief. These services were recognized by a KCB in 1860, and in 1861 he left India. In the following year Birch was promoted lieutenant-general and retired on full pay. In 1868 he married Mary, daughter of Captain George P. Burden. On 25 February 1875 he died at Venice, aged seventy-two, his wife surviving him.<br>
