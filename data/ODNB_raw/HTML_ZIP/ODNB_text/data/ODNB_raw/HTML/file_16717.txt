<span class="headword">Lindsay,  William</span>, eighteenth earl of Crawford and second earl of Lindsay  (1644&#150;1698), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born in April 1644, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16706/', "John Lindsay, seventeenth earl of Crawford and first earl of Lindsay (1596&#150;1678)")</script>, and Lady Margaret, second daughter of James Hamilton, second marquess of Hamilton. William succeeded to the earldoms on the death of his father in 1678. Described by Burnet as &#145;passionate in his temper, and &hellip; out of measure zealous in his principles&#146;  (Burnet, 4.52), Crawford's inflexible presbyterian beliefs largely determined the course of his political career. In the years before the revolution of 1688 his religious nonconformity made him an obvious target for government persecution, and it would appear he had little choice but to live in profound retirement. His problems were compounded by his obvious financial difficulties, resulting from his father's extravagance, and through having made his non-entailed property responsible for payment of the former earl's debts. These circumstances were certainly instrumental in Crawford's decision to leave the country&#151;even before the death of Charles II&#151;although ultimately he could not obtain the requisite permission.<br>
<br>It is hardly surprising that Crawford took a more active role in politics and public life following the accession of William III. He was sworn of the privy council, and regularly attended both council and parliament from 1689, being employed in a number of different capacities. In March he subscribed both the act declaring the Convention a lawful meeting of the estates and the letter of congratulation to King William. The following month he was nominated a commissioner to treat for union with England, and appointed a member of the committee of estates. In June 1689 Crawford was named president of parliament, a position he held in the first four sessions of 1689&#150;93. In a letter to Lord Melville on 22 July 1689 Sir William Lockhart claimed of Crawford &#145;he means well; but he is not capable to doe the Kings bussines&#146;  (Melville, 183). However, on 15 April 1690 he was appointed a commissioner of the treasury, and on 9 May one of the commissioners for settling the government of the church. Clearly this had serious repercussions for the episcopal clergy. Crawford himself affirmed that:<blockquote>no Episcopal since the late happy Revolution, whether laic or of the clergy, hath suffered by the council upon account of his opinion in church matters, but allenarly [solely] for their disowning the civil authority and setting up for a cross interest. (ibid., 376)</blockquote>However, although he may have acknowledged the virtue of moderation, his zeal against the episcopalians was unquestionably excessive. He has subsequently been described as providing &#145;the personification of official integrity whilst in fact erecting a screen behind which zealous Presbyterians, with his connivance and even active co-operation, purged the Scottish Church&#146;  (Riley, 36). But these measures must be moderated by some appreciation of the extremities inflicted on Crawford and his allies by the episcopalians after the Restoration.<br>
<br>Lindsay had married first, on 8 March 1670 at Leith, Lady Mary (1652&#150;1681), daughter of James Johnstone, earl of Annandale and Hartfell, who died in April 1681. They had three sons&#151;John, nineteenth earl of Crawford, Colonel James, who was killed in 1707 at the battle of Almanza in Spain, and Patrick, baptized at Ceres in July 1677&#151;and two daughters&#151;Henrietta and Margaret. He married, second, Lady Henrietta, daughter of Charles Seton, earl of Dunfermline, and widow of William Fleming, earl of Wigtown. They had a son, Thomas, and six daughters&#151;Anne, Christian, Margaret, Helen, Susanna, and Catherine. Crawford died on 6 March 1698, his testament being confirmed at St Andrews in September.<br>
