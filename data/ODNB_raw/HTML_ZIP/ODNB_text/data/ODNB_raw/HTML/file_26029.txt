<span class="headword">Somer <span class="st"> [Sommers]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1559), <span class="occ">court fool</span>, is of unknown parentage and place of origin. According to James Granger, Somer &#145;was some time a servant in the family of Richard Farmor, esq. of Eston Neston, in Northamptonshire&#146;  (Granger, 149), but there is no independent evidence to verify this claim. He was in Henry VIII's service by 28 June 1535, and went on to serve Edward VI, a warrant of whose reign dated 1551 authorized payment of 40<i>s</i>. to one William Seyton, &#145;whom his Majestie hath appointed to keape William Somer&#146;  (Nichols, 1.xliv&#150;xlv n.c.). Mary Tudor also found a place for Somer in her court, providing him with clothing for both ordinary and ceremonial occasions, including a supply of &#145;handkerchevers of Holland&#146;, presumably intended for wiping nose and mouth to deal with a natural condition or illness. Somer was in attendance at the coronation of Elizabeth on 15 January 1559, but is not known to have served her as court fool. He died later that year, on 15 June, and was buried at St Leonard, Shoreditch, London.<br>
<br>We know more of his clothes than of Somer the man. Aside from the possibly indicative supply of lesser linen mentioned above, there are numerous records of gifts of clothing, especially for ceremonial and masquing events. He was provided with a royal livery for wear at court, and with sometimes lavish costume for disguisings. At Henry's court he is most often mentioned in connection with the musical <i>schola</i> Henry drew together. Whether his association with these professionals was collaborative or, more likely, in the nature of comic burlesque is not known.<br>
<br>There are excellent visual sources for Somer's appearance. A psalter prepared for Henry's use by the French artist Jean Mallard in 1540  (BL, Royal MS 2.A.XVI) contains a colour illustration (fol. 63<i>v</i>) referring to a verse from <span class="roman">Psalm 52</span>: &#145;Dixit insipiens in corde suo non est Deus&#146; (&#145;The fool has said in his heart there is no God&#146;). Henry is depicted as the psalmist David, while Somer is shown as a stocky man, dressed in a green knee-length coat and wearing a purse at his belt, with short-cropped hair, hands clasped in front of him, staring anxious eyes, and raised and perhaps slightly deformed shoulders. A second illustration, a fictionalized portrait of Henry's family painted about 1545 by an unknown artist (Royal Collection), confirms Somer's physical characteristics. He occupies an archway at extreme right of the painting, remote from the main tableau but still in the picture. A pet monkey perched on his shoulder may represent one of the animated props associated with the court fool.<br>
<br>The layout of the family portrait reflects the position of Somer as favoured royal retainer. John Southworth places him in the category of &#145;innocent&#146;, or mental inadequate, rather than professional fool, in accordance with the visual sources and the payment, mentioned above, to his &#145;keeper&#146;. The familiar account of him as witty adviser and corrector of royal excesses, appearing in plays such as <span class="italic">Misogonus</span> (first performed 1564&#150;77?), in Thomas Nashe's <span class="italic">Summer's Last will and Testament</span> (1592), and in Samuel Rowley's <span class="italic">When You See Me, You Know Me</span> (1605), probably owes more to posthumous myth making than to fact. Nashe's punning use of the proper name with its final &#145;s&#146; may be responsible for fixing in the popular and scholarly mind a usage for which there is no warrant in documents contemporary with Somer. Two jest books offered as biographical histories, Robert Armin's <span class="italic">Foole upon Foole</span> (1600, expanded as <span class="italic">A Nest of Ninnies</span>, 1608) and the anonymous <span class="italic">A Pleasant History of the Life and Death of Will Summers</span> (1676), provide numerous anecdotes, many of them representing standard jests. Armin's account of Somer's tendency to fall into sudden sleep in unexpected places may nevertheless reflect a genuine and progressive illness.<br>
