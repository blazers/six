<span class="headword">Boulsover,  Thomas</span>  (1705&#150;1788), <span class="occ">cutler</span>, was born in Ecclesfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and baptized in the parish church on 18 October 1705, the fifth of the nine children of Samuel Bolsover (1670&#150;1721), farmer and cutler, and Margaret (1673&#150;1716), daughter of George and Alice Brownell. From 1719 he was apprenticed to Joseph Fletcher (<i>d</i>. 1746), cutler, in Sheffield. He became a freeman of the Cutlers' Company of Hallamshire, in the county of York, on 26 November 1726 and was assigned the mark &#145;cross above crescent above finial&#146; with which to stamp his cutlery. In the same year he established a cutlery workshop on Norfolk Street, Sheffield. Also in that year, on 28 October at Sheffield parish church, he married Hannah (1706&#150;1772), youngest of the three children of John Dodworth, of Owlerton, and Sarah Crook, who married in 1695. Thomas and Hannah Boulsover had ten children, of whom only two daughters survived beyond childhood. Mary (1737&#150;1812), their fifth child, married Joseph Mitchell (1728&#150;1788) on 14 February 1760; on the occasion of their wedding Boulsover entered into partnership with Mitchell. Sarah (1739&#150;1810), their sixth child, married William Hutton, a country squire from Kirby West, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, in Sheffield parish church on 30 October 1764.<br>
<br>Tradition relates that in 1743 Boulsover was repairing a knife handle composed of silver and copper, and by heating the adjacent metals fused them together. This &#145;accidental discovery&#146; resulted in the invention of fused plate  (Hatfield and Hatfield, 120). Known as Old Sheffield Plate this was the foundation of Sheffield's fine metalwork and silver industry. Fusing silver to copper creates an alloy that can be worked using silversmithing techniques to produce an article with the external appearance of silver yet at a fraction of the cost of a solid silver article. A brick of copper fused with a sheet of silver is rolled and worked in sheet form.<br>
<br>Boulsover began the manufacture of fused-plate buttons and buckles, costly silver buttons being then in fashion. Fused plate replaced his cutlery manufacture, and by 1747 he had no further cutlery apprentices. However, another cutler, Joseph Hancock (1711&#150;1790), exploited fused plate to make hollow-ware from <i>c</i>.1755. Within a decade the manufacture of fused-plate hollow-ware was widespread in Sheffield. However, Boulsover, who had invented fused plate, took no part in developing it for hollow-ware production and did not patent his process.<br>
<br>At the end of the 1750s Boulsover was a man of some means, being both a freeholder and a country gentleman; in 1757 he moved his family from Norfolk Street to Whiteley Wood Hall, a seventeenth-century property on the outskirts of Sheffield, and at the same time moved his workshop to larger premises on Norfolk Street. He was involved in local discussions over a turnpike road from Sheffield to Leeds, and his signature appears as one of twenty-five on a petition of 1759 (also confirming the spelling of his name) for the turnpike from Sheffield to Manchester. He remained committed to improving roads throughout his life.<br>
<br>The 1760s saw a further contribution by Boulsover to the metalwork industry: the development of rolled cast steel for saw making. Rolling cast steel produces a stronger alloy than hammered cast steel. This venture was served by workshops, workers' cottages, an enlarged dam, and an improved water-wheel on the River Porter, below Whitely Wood Hall. Following Boulsover's death Boulsover &amp; Co. continued under the ownership of the Mitchell and Hutton families, and after 1814 was renamed Mitchell &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Thomas Boulsover died at Whiteley Wood Hall on 9 September 1788. He was buried in St Paul's churchyard, Sheffield, with his wife, on 13 September. He was &#145;typical of the class of men who, by their observation, imagination, industry and ability, laid the foundation of modern Sheffield&#146;  (Hatfield and Hatfield, 10).<br>
