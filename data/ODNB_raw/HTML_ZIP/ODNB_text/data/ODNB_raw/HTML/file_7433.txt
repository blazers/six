<span class="headword">Delamotte <span class="st"> [ de la Motte]</span>,  William</span>  (1775&#150;1863), <span class="occ">landscape artist</span>, was born at Weymouth, Dorset, on 2 August 1775, the eldest son of Peter De la Motte and his wife, Sarah, daughter of the Revd Digby Cotes of Abbey Dore, Herefordshire. His father was of Huguenot extraction and was postal agent at Weymouth, where he established a library with assembly rooms over it on the esplanade. William is said to have attracted the notice of George III, a frequent visitor to Weymouth, and to have been placed by him as a pupil of Benjamin West, president of the Royal Academy, the king's favourite artist. Delamotte entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1794, having first exhibited at the Royal Academy in the previous year. He continued to exhibit paintings and watercolours each year until 1805, and from 1809 at irregular intervals until 1850. In his early watercolours Delamotte was influenced by Thomas Girtin, but he soon established his own reputation, especially with his Welsh watercolours, and developed a more personal manner, in which the washes were very lightly applied over delicate pen or pencil outlines. He was an excellent architectural draughtsman, and also a sympathetic recorder of the landscape, at first in and around Oxford, on the Thames, in Wales, Cumberland, and Derbyshire, and later also on the continent. In the early years of the nineteenth century he was one of a group of pioneering younger British artists that included Constable and Turner, who sketched landscape in the open in oils.<br>
<br>Delamotte lived in Oxford for a period from 1798, where he briefly took over J. B. Malchair's practice as a drawing-master, and where he restored the Streater ceiling decoration in the Sheldonian Theatre. In 1802, at the time of the peace of Amiens, he was one of the many British artists to visit Paris, where he spent ten weeks. In the following year he was appointed an assistant drawing-master at the Royal Military College at (first at Marlow, then from 1812 at Sandhurst), where he remained, ultimately as drawing-master, for some forty years. According to Joseph Farington, whose <span class="italic">Diary</span> provides what little personal information there is about Delamotte, he was &#145;not liked&#146;  (8.2936). He married on 28 August 1804, Mary Anne, eldest daughter of Thomas Gage, with whom he had five sons and four daughters. Delamotte became an associate member of the newly formed Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1806, but exhibited only for three years and was never elected a full member. After 1815 he travelled more extensively on the continent, and he exhibited views of Belgium, France, and Switzerland. A few of his topographical drawings were engraved, and in 1816 he published <span class="italic">Thirty Etchings of Rural Subjects</span>. His work is well represented in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and there are drawings in the print rooms of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and elsewhere. A sale of William Delamotte's drawings and sketches took place at Sothebys in May 1864.<br>
<br>Delamotte died of old age at his daughter's house, The Lawn, St Giles' Fields, near Oxford, on 13 March 1863. His youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37352/', "Philip Henry Delamotte (1821&#150;1889)")</script>, was a pioneer photographer and a successful drawing-master, who was appointed professor of fine art at King's College, London, in 1879. Another son, <a name="cosubject_7433"></a><span class="headword">Freeman Gage Delamotte</span>  (1813/14&#150;1862), born at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Berkshire, was a <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span> who published several works on alphabets and illumination. He was twice married: first, in 1843, to Louisa (1818/19&#150;1854), with whom he had a son and two daughters; and second, in 1855, to Caroline (1829/30&#150;1886), with whom he had a son and a daughter. He died at 15 Beaufort Buildings, Strand, Middlesex, on 16 July 1862, aged forty-eight. Another son, Alfred William, who is sometimes confused with his father, was also a watercolour artist. A cousin, Lieutenant-Colonel <a name="cosubject_7434"></a><span class="headword">Philip  de la Motte</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1805), was the <span class="occ">author</span> of <span class="italic">The principal historical and allusive arms borne by families of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland &hellip; collected by an antiquary, with biographical memoirs &hellip; and copper-plates</span>, published in 1803. He died at Batsford, Gloucestershire, on 11 March 1805.<br>
