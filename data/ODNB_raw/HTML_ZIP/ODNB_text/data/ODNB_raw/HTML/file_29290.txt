<span class="headword">Whitehead,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1696), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and preacher</span>, was born in the Holderness district of Yorkshire. About 1648 he joined the army and was subsequently stationed at Scarborough Castle. Influenced by his parents, he was attracted to puritan ministers and often had &#145;secret breathings and longings after God&#146;, but he eventually concluded that he lacked &#145;living faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Writings</span>, 3). When William Dewsbury came to Scarborough about 1652 he convinced Whitehead to become a Quaker. A man of modest education, Whitehead believed that God's &#145;secrets were with me; for the Spirit as a key opened his treasure and shewed me that which was from the beginning&#146;  (J. Whitehead, <span class="italic">A Small Treatise</span>, 1661, 5). He accompanied Dewsbury to Malton, Yorkshire, and began preaching in December 1652. After leaving the army the following summer, he and Thomas Thompson preached on the Yorkshire moors. At Stokesley he challenged the Baptist William Kaye to demonstrate whether he had an unmediated calling from Christ, whether ministers had received tithes in gospel times, and whether he could disprove Quaker tenets. Kaye published an account of the dispute in <span class="italic">A Plain Answer to the Eighteen Quaeries</span> (1654). With Dewsbury, George Fox, and James Nayler, Whitehead contributed to <span class="italic">Several Letters Written to the Saints</span> the same year.<br>
<br>Undaunted by confrontation, Whitehead preached in Lincoln Cathedral in November 1654 and had to be rescued from irate worshippers by soldiers. While incarcerated in Northampton in 1655 he wrote <span class="italic">The Enmitie between the Two Seeds</span> (1655) as well as epistles exhorting Friends to withstand persecution and suffer patiently. Following his release he preached in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, and then went to east Yorkshire, where he addressed <span class="italic">A Reproof from the Lord</span> (1656) to professing Christians in the Hull and Beverley area, accusing them of pursuing earthly wisdom. With George Whitehead and George Fox the younger he refuted the views of John Horne and Thomas Moore in <span class="italic">A Brief Discovery of the Dangerous Principles</span> (1659).<br>
<br>As hostility against Quakers intensified, Whitehead was physically attacked at York in January 1660. With thirty-five others he signed <span class="italic">This to the King and his Councel</span> (1660), protesting the disruption of Quaker meetings in Northamptonshire. For refusing to take the oath of allegiance he was incarcerated at Aylesbury in January 1661, and in May he published <span class="italic">A Small Treatise</span>, denouncing compulsory worship; it included a postscript by his fellow prisoner Isaac Penington.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1662 Whitehead finished <span class="italic">A Manifestation of Truth</span> (1662), in which he defended Quaker principles from Viscount Saye and Sele's attack in <span class="italic">Folly and Madnesse Made Manifest</span> (1659). Arrested on 8 July on suspicion of holding a conventicle near Lincoln, Whitehead, then of Owstwick, Yorkshire, refused to take an oath and was recommitted to Lincoln Castle. In <span class="italic">For the Vineyard of the Lord of Hosts</span> (1662) he defended Quakers from charges of sedition and implored God to &#145;break&#146; the adversaries' &#145;teeth &hellip; that thy Flock may not be meat for them&#146;  (p. 6). In <span class="italic">An Expostulation with the Bishops in England</span> (1662) he urged prelates to reform their own church. Quakers who had lapsed in the face of persecution were admonished to return in <span class="italic">The Case of such Professors</span> (1662).<br>
<br>On his return to Yorkshire, following his release in April 1663, Whitehead was briefly detained and his books and letters were seized at Hull in July. By November 1664 he was in gaol at Spalding, Lincolnshire, from where he wrote an epistle encouraging Friends to adhere to their ideal of simplicity, later printed in <span class="italic">A Tender Visitation</span> (1664). With George Whitehead and others he signed an epistle by Farnsworth in May 1666 warning Friends not to distribute scandalous or divisive books, and in August he and Ellis Hookes, working through the master of requests, persuaded Charles II to release Fox from Scarborough Castle.<br>
<br>As sectarian controversy continued Whitehead contributed a postscript to Thomas Rudyard's <span class="italic">The Anabaptists Lying Wonder</span> (1672), and when Baptists attacked him in <span class="italic">The Quakers Subterfuge</span> (<i>c</i>.1672) he responded in a postscript to Robert Ruckhill's <span class="italic">The Quakers Refuge</span> (1673). Ruckhill and Whitehead were assailed in Thomas Grantham's <span class="italic">The Baptist Against the Quaker</span> (<i>c</i>.1673), and Grantham recounted his debate with Whitehead at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, which dealt with the sacraments and Christ's post-resurrection body, in <span class="italic">Christianismus primitivus</span> (1678). William Penn included Whitehead's declaration against the Quaker dissident John Perrot in <span class="italic">Judas and the Jews</span> (1673). In 1675 Whitehead and John Hall drafted an account of the persecution of Yorkshire Friends for submission to Charles and parliament, and the same year Whitehead wrote an epistle to <span class="italic">Balm from Gilead</span>, a collection of Quaker testimonies. When the Popish Plot was under investigation, Whitehead and Thompson asked the assize judges at York on 24 March 1679 which Quakers had been accused of being Jesuits.<br>
<br>At some point before 1682 Whitehead married Elizabeth, with whom he apparently had two sons and a daughter. As a trustee for charitable property, he left for London in May 1682 to deal with a suit in chancery involving a legacy of &pound;200. Stopping to preach at Sutton, Lincolnshire, he was arrested, accused of being a Jesuit, and imprisoned. At the assizes on 31 July he produced certificates attesting to his good behaviour, including one from the vicar and churchwardens at Swine, Yorkshire, where he had moved in 1669. Because he refused to take the oath of allegiance, the grand jury indicted him and he was returned to prison. There he wrote <span class="italic">A General Epistle</span> (1682), warning Anglicans to beware of an accommodation with Catholics. At his trial on 7 March 1683 he was found guilty of <i>praemunire</i>. His family moved to Fiskerton, near Lincoln, in 1683, perhaps to be closer to him. He enjoyed limited freedom, for he was at a Quaker meeting in July 1684 when JPs fined those in attendance. Some time after October 1684 he was discharged, but he and nine others were apprehended at a meeting in Devonshire House, London, on 11 February 1686. He was fined 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., but refused to pay and remained in Newgate until 2 June.<br>
<br>During the last decade of his life Whitehead served as clerk of the Lincolnshire quarterly meeting and continued to travel as a public Friend (minister). In 1691 he was one of thirteen Friends Fox designated to supervise the publication of his journal and other writings. After two or three years of poor health Whitehead died at Fiskerton on 29 September 1696 and was buried at Lincoln on 1 October. A short, thick-set man, he was praised by George Whitehead (to whom he was unrelated) as &#145;a man of a solid and sound judgment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Writings</span>, 279). Lincolnshire Friends described him as &#145;a nursing father, tender and affectionate, apt to teach&#146;  (ibid., 281). His stature in early Quaker history was attested to by Penn in the preface to Whitehead's <span class="italic">The Written Gospel-Labours</span> (1704).<br>
