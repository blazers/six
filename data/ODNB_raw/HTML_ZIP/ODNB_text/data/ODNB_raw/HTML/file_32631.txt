<span class="headword">Cripps,  Wilfred Joseph</span>  (1841&#150;1903), <span class="occ">writer on silver</span>, was born on 8 June 1841 in London, the eldest surviving child of William Cripps (1804/5&#150;1848), barrister and MP for Cirencester, and his wife (and cousin), Mary Anne Harrison, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12431/', "Benjamin Harrison (1771&#150;1856)")</script>, treasurer of Guy's Hospital. The Cripps family, whose wealth came from the wool trade, had been prominent citizens of Cirencester since the sixteenth century. Cripps's grandfather Joseph Cripps (1765&#150;1847) sat as an independently minded MP for the town in 1806&#150;12 and 1818&#150;41. He was succeeded in the representation by his son William Cripps (Wilfred's father). A Conservative, he was made a lord of the Treasury in 1845, supported Peel over the repeal of the corn laws, and died on 11 May 1848.<br>
<br>Wilfred Joseph Cripps was educated at Kensington grammar school and at King's College, London, and Trinity College, Oxford, where he was admitted in 1859 and graduated BA in 1863 before proceeding MA in 1866. He took an active part in the volunteer movement, frequently attending the rifle competitions at Wimbledon. In May 1865 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple and, like his father, practised for a few years on the Oxford circuit. On 31 May 1870 he married Maria Harriet Arabella Daniel-Tyssen (<i>d</i>. 1881), second daughter of John Robert Daniel-Tyssen.<br>
<br>It is for his research and publications in the field of decorative arts, specifically silver studies, that Cripps deserves to be remembered. His interest in old silver began in the early 1870s, when he was introduced by William, fifth Earl Bathurst, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19218/', "Charles Octavius Swinnerton Morgan")</script>, the antiquary, who entrusted Cripps with his notes on the subject. In 1878 Cripps published <span class="italic">Old English Plate</span>, his major scholarly work. This drew on the researches of Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks, Morgan himself, William Chaffers, and others, but brought them to a wider audience, and thereby greatly stimulated the demand for antique silver. Nine editions of the manual appeared between 1878 and 1906, with each new edition containing fresh material; there were subsequent reprints in 1927, 1967, and 1977. Cripps's interest in the subject was broad: in 1880 he published <span class="italic">Old French Plate</span> (2nd edn, 1893), and in 1881 he produced <span class="italic">College and Corporation Plate: a handbook to the reproductions of silver plate in the South Kensington Museum, from celebrated English collections</span>. His paper on the old church plate of Northumberland and Durham, read before the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, was later published  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Aeliana</span>, 1st ser., 16, 249&#150;67).<br>
<br>Cripps was recognized as a leading authority on silver, and became an adviser to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). In October 1880, with the museum's director, Sir Francis Philip Cunliffe-Owen, he persuaded the Russian government to allow the reproduction of plate from the magnificent imperial collection using the electrotyping process. The success of their enterprise did much to advance the study of silver, through the copies that were lent to art schools and used to illustrate textbooks. He also helped to acquire important silver for the museum, notably Elizabethan plate from the Mostyn family in 1885. In 1880 Cripps was a member of the English subcommission connected with the exhibition of gold and silver work at Amsterdam  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 28 Feb 1880, 289).<br>
<br>Cripps was also interested in archaeology. He excavated Roman sites in Cirencester and reported on them to the Society of Antiquaries, of which he became a fellow in 1880. He served in the Royal North Gloucester militia, from which he retired with the rank of major, and completed the regimental history begun by Sir J. Maxwell Steele-Groves (published in 1875). He was made a CB in 1889, and in 1894 received the honorary freedom of the Goldsmiths' Company. He took in a keen interest in local affairs, especially education, and in politics he was active in the Conservative cause.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife in 1881, Cripps married, on 2 December 1884, Helena Augusta Wilhelmine, Countess Bismarck, daughter of Count Bismarck of Scherstein, Prussia, a relative of the Iron Chancellor. There were no children of either marriage. Cripps died at his residence, Cripps Mead, Cirencester, on 26 October 1903, and was buried in Cirencester cemetery. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
