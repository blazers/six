<span class="headword">Harvey, Sir  John</span>  (1778&#150;1852), <span class="occ">army officer and administrator in Canada</span>, was born on 23 April 1778 in England. Complete mystery surrounds his background. Rumours that he was an illegitimate son of the first marquess of Anglesey are undoubtedly untrue. Nothing certain is known about his youth except that he was brought up in Dronfield, Derbyshire, by the vicar, the Revd John Russell. On 18 September 1794 he became an ensign in the 80th regiment of foot, and from 1794 to 1802 he served in the Netherlands, at the Cape of Good Hope, in Ceylon, and in Egypt. From 1803 to 1807 he was in India, where he joined the staff of the commander-in-chief, Lord Lake, whose daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1851), he married on 16 June 1806. They had five sons and one daughter. On 15 July 1798 Harvey became a lieutenant, on 9 September 1803 a captain, and on 28 January 1808 a major. After being employed in England during the first half of 1808 as an assistant quartermaster-general, he was stationed in Ireland from July 1808 to 1812.<br>
<br>On 25 June 1812 Harvey became a lieutenant-colonel and deputy adjutant-general in Upper Canada. By travelling overland from New Brunswick on snowshoes, he arrived in Upper Canada early in 1813 and played a conspicuous part in the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14. On 6 June 1813, at the battle of Stoney Creek, he attacked and drove back an American force five times larger than his own. In November 1813 he earned a medal at the battle of Crysler's Farm, and he was wounded during the siege of Fort Erie on 6 August 1814. Although he went on half pay in 1817, he became knight commander of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1824 and in May 1825 was made a colonel. Through seniority he rose to the rank of major-general in January 1837 and lieutenant-general in November 1846.<br>
<br>Without private means Harvey desperately needed a civil appointment. In 1825&#150;6 he served on the commission to determine the price of crown land in Upper Canada and from 1828 to 1836 as one of the four inspectors-general of the newly formed Irish constabulary, with responsibility for Leinster. During the tithe wars of the 1830s Leinster was the centre of agitation: Harvey did everything in his power to promote compromise and avoid bloodshed and won recognition for his moderation. In 1832 he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on Ireland and recommended the solution to the tithes question that was eventually adopted. In April 1836 the Irish constabulary was reorganized and his post abolished, but he was compensated with the position of lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island.<br>
<br>In 1767 the whole of Prince Edward Island had been divided into townships, distributed by lottery to landlords in Britain, and on his arrival in August 1836 Harvey was confronted by an assembly controlled by a popular party demanding confiscation of the estates, a policy opposed by the Colonial Office. Harvey sought to take the initiative out of the hands of the escheat party by persuading the landlords resident in Britain to make concessions to their tenants, and he supported a measure to increase the taxes paid by non-resident landlords. These measures temporarily restored a degree of tranquillity to the island and won Harvey considerable popularity and a reputation for being able to handle recalcitrant assemblies. This reputation was later enhanced in New Brunswick, where he was transferred in May 1837 to succeed lieutenant-governor Sir Archibald Campbell, who was at loggerheads with his assembly. By surrendering to the assembly control over the rapidly increasing revenues derived from the sale of crown lands, and reconstructing his executive council to include the leaders of the colony's Reform movement, Harvey established a harmonious working relationship with the majority in the assembly and ensured New Brunswick's loyalty during the Canadian uprising of 1837&#150;8. In 1838 he was created KCB for his services and he was fulsomely praised in the Durham report in 1839 and by Governor-General Lord Sydenham in 1840.<br>
<br>Harvey was less successful in resolving the Maine&#150;New Brunswick boundary dispute. Although he prevented friction along the border from evolving into a serious conflict, he was not sufficiently aggressive in upholding the British claims, and in 1841 he was abruptly dismissed, although later that year he was reassigned as governor of Newfoundland. In Newfoundland sectarian violence between the predominantly English and protestant urban middle class in St John's and the largely Irish and Roman Catholic majority in the outports had led to the suspension of the constitution. The new constitution imposed by the <span class="roman">Newfoundland Act</span> of 1842 was opposed by the largely Catholic Reform Party, but Harvey again showed his remarkable abilities as a conciliator. He put an end, at least temporarily, to the sectarian violence and won the respect of the colony's Roman Catholics, although in 1846 he could not convince the Reformers to agree to a renewal of the <span class="roman">Newfoundland Act</span>. None the less, his sojourn in Newfoundland was not a particularly happy one. He went deeply into debt maintaining a lifestyle he could not afford, and he was reprimanded by the Colonial Office for borrowing money from his colonial secretary.<br>
<br>In August 1846 Harvey was given the more lucrative post of lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia. His instructions were to engineer a coalition between the colony's Conservatives, who dominated the assembly and the executive council, and the Reformers, who were likely to win the next election and were demanding the introduction of responsible party government. Despite his best efforts, Harvey was unable to construct a coalition, and following the election of August 1847 he had no option but to dismiss the Conservatives and admit the Reformers to office. On 2 February 1848 he therefore reluctantly presided over the introduction of the first formally responsible party ministry in the British empire. The transition did not prove easy. A stream of petitions was sent to London accusing Harvey of identifying himself with the new Reform administration, and he lost the confidence of the secretary of state for the colonies, the third Earl Grey, who was unwilling to accept the full implications of the new system and criticized Harvey for not restraining the partisanship of his new advisers. Harvey suffered a shattering blow when his wife died on 10 April 1851, and his health rapidly deteriorated. He began a six-month leave of absence in May, but on his return was incapable of performing even routine tasks. On 22 March 1852 he died at Government House, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was buried in the military cemetery in Halifax alongside his wife.<br>
<br>Harvey was lucky in that the long wars against France opened up unusual opportunities for the promotion of officers like himself who had neither family connections nor large personal fortunes. Repeatedly he won recognition for acts of daring and bravery: but most of his military service was spent in backwaters. During the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14 Harvey became one of the best-known military officers in British North America, but after the war he was just one of a vast number of young officers with an uncertain future. After a false start in Ireland, at the age of fifty-eight he began a new career as a colonial administrator and eventually served in more British North American colonies than any other governor. Partly because his origins were humble, he did not find exile among the colonists as tedious as did most of his contemporaries, and everywhere he served he won popular support. Noted for his tolerance and flexibility, he was the ideal colonial administrator during a period when the role of the governor was undergoing a fundamental transformation.<br>
