<span class="headword">Ker,  Andrew, of Ferniehirst</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1545), <span class="occ">border chieftain</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Ker (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1484), the first Ker laird of Ferniehirst, and his wife, Margaret Ker. He was referred to as Andrew Ker of Crailing in 1491, but had taken his father's designation of Ferniehirst by 1500. By 6 November 1501 he had married Janet Home of Polwarth; they had at least three sons and four daughters including Robert Ker of Ancrum, progenitor of the earls of Lothian. Their eldest son, Thomas, died in 1524, so their second son, John, became heir. Other siblings were well provided for, as this successful branch of the Kers accumulated much property in Jedforest, Jedburgh, Ettrick Forest, and Haddingtonshire, as well as from Kelso Abbey. Ker often resorted to litigation to establish and protect his family's property rights. From the abbreviation of his Christian name he was known as Dand Ker throughout his adult life; he is occasionally confused with Andrew Ker of Cessford during the first decades of the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Politically the Kers of Ferniehirst were bound to the fifth and sixth earls of Angus until 1528 when the crown took control of the forfeited Angus estates. The Kers benefited financially and socially from the downfall of the house of Angus as the Rutherford lairds of Hundalee and Hunthill then gave bonds of manrent (contracts of mutual obligation) to Ferniehirst instead of to Angus. The Kers were also significant landlords within the town of Jedburgh. Their joint father-and-son office of baillie of Jedforest was confirmed in 1515, as being held from the earl of Angus, and in 1542 from the crown, for &pound;10 Scots per annum. In 1520 the sixth earl and Ferniehirst were in dispute about this office and held rival courts. Ferniehirst and his eldest son were also baillies of Jedburgh Abbey's lands within Roxburghshire for an annual fee of &pound;10 Scots. These bonds and offices undoubtedly made the Kers of Ferniehirst the most powerful family within this part of the Scottish middle march.<br>
<br>Beyond his local influence Ferniehirst was involved with national politics and international affairs connected to the Anglo-Scottish frontier. After the defeat at Flodden in 1513 he attended the Scottish council at Perth. In 1515 he attended parliament for the first time, and he returned again in 1526 to deny charges of treason laid against him by the earl of Angus. Despite being declared &#145;clene and innocent&#146; he went back to parliament only once more, to condemn the death in 1526 of his kinsman Andrew Ker of Cessford  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 2.303&#150;4). Ferniehirst began his long service in border administration around 1502 as a deputy warden of the middle march. He was warded in 1516 to keep better rule upon the borders, but he served his country well in time of war. For example, he harried English attackers after Flodden, attacked Wark-on-Tweed in 1522, and burned parts of Norhamshire in 1533. He was badly injured during the Wark attack, but recovered before Ferniehirst and Jedburgh were targeted by English forces in September 1523. There was intermittent friction with the Cessford branch of the Kers over control of the middle march, but their direct blood relationship ensured that this did not erupt into a blood feud. Jointly held wardenships and deputy wardenships were often used as a compromise in this dispute. The killing of Andrew Ker of Cessford provoked a long and bitter feud with the Scotts of Buccleuch; the marriage of Sir Walter Scott to Ferniehirst's daughter Janet in 1530 represented one attempt to settle it, though this ended in divorce.<br>
<br>After Cessford's death in 1526 Ferniehirst continued to serve as a deputy warden, and in 1528 he was elevated to the commission for Anglo-Scottish peace that led to the treaty of Berwick. In 1530 the king recognized Ferniehirst's local power and influence by making him a border commissioner, but he had to swear to a bond of 10,000 merks to enter notorious Liddesdale thieves, hold a justice ayre at Jedburgh, and deliver any of his own men demanded by the opposite warden. It was not until 1538 that Ferniehirst held the middle march wardenship in his own right. He remained in command until 1542, though he reluctantly shared power with Robert, fifth Lord Maxwell, as keeper of Liddesdale in 1541&#150;2. In 1539 Ker was described as &#145;a shrewd old practitioner of the Border&#146; and was arguably at the peak of his power  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 14/1, no. 50), having successfully apprehended various troublemakers within his domain and implemented royal justice. In 1540 a grateful James V rewarded his loyalty by making his Jedburgh Forest lands into the free barony of Ferniehirst. Ferniehirst even managed to get a civil court action against him transferred from Edinburgh to Jedburgh, where his son-in-law, Sir James Douglas of Cavers, could be relied upon to give him favourable justice as sheriff of Roxburgh.<br>
<br>This golden age for Ferniehirst was cut short by the renewal of English hostilities in the borders. In 1542 the English respected him as &#145;a wise and sober man&#146; and clearly wanted him on their side  (Bain, 1.347). At first Ferniehirst was loyal and fought off English attacks and bribes, but he was later described as &#145;so crafty an old fox&#146;, for playing one side against the other by simultaneously taking money from both English and Franco-Scottish forces, and he was criticized for being &#145;superstitious and Popish&#146; in his religion  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 18/1, no. 592). Nevertheless, persistent and brutal harrying of the Kers and the capture of Ferniehirst and his son in July 1544 led to their assuring to England. Ferniehirst was injured and held captive at Warkworth Castle. He begged to be returned home, but the English privy council mistrusted him. They let him home only in October after he had left his grandson Thomas as a hostage and placed a company of English soldiers in his house. In December he thanked the earl of Shrewsbury for sending &#145;Thome&#146; to school, but requested that his heir John return as he was himself &#145;agyt&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 19/2, no. 768). He was then forfeited by the Scottish crown for &#145;tressonabill intercomonyng &hellip; with the auld inymeis of Ingland&#146;  (Livingston and others, 3.166).<br>
<br>The assurance of the border lairds remained uncertain, however. They contributed to the Scottish victory at Ancrum Moor on 27 February 1545, but the devastation inflicted by Hertford's invasion in the following September led many lairds to reassure to the English though the house of the &#145;crasit and secklie&#146; Ferniehirst was spared  (BL, Add. MS 32656, fol. 148). John Ferniehirst attended the October parliament on his father's behalf and signed a bond to resist the &#145;auld Inymis of Ingland and defend the Realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 2.461&#150;2), but the English garrisoning of southern Scotland forced the Kers to remain in English allegiance until the wars ended in 1549. When Ferniehirst died in October 1545 his grandson was still in English custody, but John Ker's succession was unimpeded.<br>
