<span class="headword">Kirkham,  Walter  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1260), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Durham</span>, may have come from Kirkham in Yorkshire. It was perhaps as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Hubert de Burgh that he emerged early in 1224 as one of two accountants of the principal financial department of the royal household, the wardrobe. In August 1231, with de Burgh's star waning, he apparently left royal service, but he returned to office, and once more accounted for the wardrobe, between May 1234 and October 1236, at a time of important administrative reforms. His government career was supported by the normal accumulation of ecclesiastical benefices. In 1226 he was briefly dean of the royal free chapel of Penkridge, Staffordshire, moving on to that of St Mary's, Shrewsbury. In 1227 he became parson of Rudby, Yorkshire, and during the latter part of 1229 dean of St Martin's-le-Grand in London, another royal chapel, often bestowed on leading royal servants; the royal manor of Newport in Essex, where the church formed a major part of the dean's endowment, was granted to him for life shortly afterwards. By 1232 he held a canonry at York, to which was added a canonry at Lincoln in 1235, and another at Chichester within a year.<br>
<br>In 1244 Kirkham became dean of York. Then, following the resignation of Nicholas of Farnham he was elected bishop of Durham on 21 April 1249, despite Henry III's efforts on behalf of his own half-brother, Aymer de Valence (<i>d</i>. 1260). Temporalities were restored on 20 October, and Kirkham was consecrated in York by Archbishop Walter de Gray on 5 December. He connived with the prior of Durham in raising with the pope the generous provision that diverted almost a third of the bishopric's endowments to the support of Farnham throughout the eight years of his retirement; their application was unsuccessful. He confirmed Farnham's gifts to the Durham monks, and himself granted them a tract of wood and waste in the Pennine foothills at Muggleswick, with licence to enclose it. When the see of Carlisle fell vacant in 1254 he claimed the sequestration fruits arising during vacancies from churches in his diocese that belonged to the bishopric of Carlisle; he pursued the claim tenaciously and it was finally accepted shortly after his death, following a payment of 1000 marks by the bishop of Durham. An increasingly violent dispute with John de Balliol over knights' fees in the wapentake of Sadberge (co. Durham), in the course of which the bishop was ambushed and four of his servants taken prisoner, was probably ended by Kirkham's imposing on Balliol the penance of assigning money in perpetuity to support poor scholars at Oxford&#151;the first steps towards the foundation of Balliol College. It is not known whether he issued any diocesan statutes; those formerly attributed to him are now believed to be those of Bishop Farnham.<br>
<br>Accounts differ as to whether it was Kirkham, or Peter d'Aigueblanche, bishop of Hereford, who was sent by the king to Rome in 1255 with a blank sealed schedule which was used to pledge the English church to Sienese merchants for 9000 marks. Kirkham was certainly appointed to commissions on affairs relating to Scotland, and took part in the major embassy sent in 1257 in response to problems arising during Alexander III's minority. He may have given tacit support to the provisions of Oxford in 1258, for in that year he quarrelled with the king and refused to come to court. Moreover it was in Kirkham's London palace that Simon de Montfort set up his household in 1258; here, on the riverside landing stage, took place the oft-quoted exchange between Montfort and Henry III, when the king admitted that his fear of thunder and lightning was outweighed by his fear of Simon. Kirkham died, full of days, at the episcopal manor of Howden in Yorkshire on 9 August 1260, and was buried in Durham Cathedral chapter house eight days later.<br>
