<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Richard</span>  (1739&#150;1785), <span class="occ">merchant and director of the East India Company</span>, was born in Westmorland on 10 March 1739 and baptized on 5 April at St James's Church, Temple Sowerby, Westmorland. He was the third son of Matthew Atkinson of Temple Sowerby and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Richard Sutton of Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland. He moved to London &#145;unsustained by any inheritance, by few family friends of any power, and by no acquisitions which education imparts but common penmanship and arithmetic&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 570).<br>
<br>By the early 1770s Atkinson was a partner in the firm of Mure, Son, and Atkinson, West India merchants of Nicholas Lane, later of Fenchurch Street. During the American War of Independence he held lucrative contracts to supply the British forces in North America and Gibraltar. It was at this time also that he purchased sufficient East India Company stock to enable him to vote in the annual elections of company directors and on the major issues of the day that came before the company's court of proprietors. Influential City merchants like Atkinson were called on by the government of Lord North to support its efforts to reform the company's administration. Atkinson was a close confidant of John Robinson (also from Westmorland), Lord North's secretary to the Treasury and political manager. Atkinson's East India business interests included connections with Paul Benfield, the notorious &#145;nabob&#146;. Benfield had been removed by the directors from his company position in Madras for misdemeanours and was a prominent creditor of the nawab of Arcot, the company's puppet ruler in the Carnatic. Atkinson acted as Benfield's London agent, and helped secure his reinstatement in 1781. Through Benfield, Atkinson became involved with the nawab's creditors in London&#151;the &#145;Arcot interest&#146;&#151;who aimed to persuade the company to legitimize the nawab's debts and make provision for their repayment.<br>
<br>By the early 1780s Atkinson was no longer taking a government line in East India affairs and was a member of the company committee appointed by stockholders to oppose Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span> in 1783. He was now increasingly acting with the company's various &#145;Indian&#146; factions which had come together to defend the governorship of Warren Hastings from government attack. They attached themselves to the party forming round William Pitt. When Fox's bill failed and his supporters in the company's court of directors resigned, Atkinson was one of three new directors swept into office by the tide of opinion running against Fox within the company. James Macpherson, London agent for the nawab of Arcot, told Hastings:<blockquote>how much we all owe, in these disagreeable times, to the ability, friendship and exertions of Mr. Atkinson. I have mentioned in another letter the great talents and extensive influence of the gentleman; and how happy I was to find that he is inclined to employ both against the current of injustice and proscription which now prevails here against our Eastern friends. (Macpherson to Hastings, 22 April 1782, BL, Add. MS 29154, fol. 134)</blockquote>Atkinson stood unsuccessfully for London with Pitt's support in the 1784 general election, but was returned for New Romney shortly afterwards. He spoke frequently in the house on East India matters and was regarded by the political commentator Nathaniel Wraxall as &#145;able and intelligent&#146; and as invariably speaking &#145;with brevity, and never venturing to deviate into tracks with which he was unacquainted&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>). Following the passing of Pitt's <span class="roman">India Act</span> of 1784, Atkinson put his services at the disposal of Henry Dundas, president of the new India Board of Control. He plied Dundas (unsuccessfully) with proposals for further reform of the company's administration, stating on 22 July that he had &#145;not one personal View in the power of the Company to gratify&#146; other than to ensure the &#145;success of a Reform in the introductory steps to which I have taken so forward a part&#146;  (Furber, 488). He did, however, continue to press the case of the Arcot creditors, and had encouraged the company's directors to oppose a clause in Pitt's draft <span class="roman">India Bill</span> requiring the company to investigate the debts. This may subsequently have contributed to Dundas's unwillingness to adopt his schemes for company reform, but in any case it was clear that Atkinson was seriously ill with consumption. He died, unmarried, on 28 May 1785 at Brighton, said to be worth &pound;300,000  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 570).<br>
