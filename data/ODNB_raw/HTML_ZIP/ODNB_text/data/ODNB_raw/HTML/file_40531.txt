<span class="headword">Leavis <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Roth]</span>,  Queenie Dorothy</span>  (1906&#150;1981), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 7 December 1906 at 79 Silver Street, Edmonton, Middlesex, the second of the three children of Morris Roth (1876&#150;1953), hosier, and afterwards draper, and Jane Davis (1876&#150;1940). Her parents were observant Jews. She was educated at Latymer School, Edmonton, and was a brilliant scholar, winning in 1925 a Carlisle scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge. In 1928 she was awarded a first-class degree with special distinction in the English tripos. She won the Charity Reeves prize, the Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Montefiore memorial prize, the Gamble prize, and the Ottilie Hancock research fellowship at Girton. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31344/', "Frank Raymond Leavis (1895&#150;1978)")</script>, literary scholar, editor, and university teacher, on 16 September 1929, which alienated her from her parents at having &#145;married out&#146; of her faith. They had three children: Ralph, born in January 1934, Kate in September 1939, and Lawrence Robin in December 1944.<br>
<br>Leavis researched for the PhD (awarded in 1932), influenced by F. R. Leavis's theories of &#145;mass culture&#146;, but was herself an investigator of great originality, studying by questionnaire how popular writers (such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of Tarzan) responded to their readership. Her dissertation was examined by E. M. Forster and published to acclaim, virtually without alteration, as <span class="italic">Fiction and the Reading Public</span> (1932). As a thesis its subtitle had been &#145;A study in social anthropology&#146;, appropriately because she used popular and classic fiction to analyse successive English cultures after the Elizabethan period, inspired by the historical sociology of H. M. Chadwick's &#145;Early literature and history&#146; course at Cambridge in which the multifarious artefacts of ancient societies were used to detail pictures of cultural identity. Leavis did not shrink from evaluating her data, maintaining that methods of mass publication levelled down the taste of the English reading public in the modern era. Her subsequent publications were fiercely critical of the second-rate. She was awarded the Amy Mary Preston Read scholarship for further research, the first woman to receive it.<br>
<br>In 1932 her husband became editor of <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span>, published quarterly until 1953, and Leavis worked indefatigably at editorial business, but also made nearly fifty contributions, on fiction and the sociology of the literary world. Her taste was eclectic, with a love for the classics as well as the best in popular writing: she read Damon Runyon to her children and repeatedly sent second-hand copies of Randall Jarrell's <span class="italic">Pictures from an Institution</span> to friends and pupils. She disliked Bloomsbury and Virginia Woolf's belief that a woman must have &#145;a room of one's own&#146;. Leavis thought that the management of a busy household was not inherently damaging to creativity, a belief which restricted her own career as an academic, as did scant employment opportunities in Cambridge, her commitment to <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span> and her husband's work, the demands of child rearing, and her frequent illnesses. Her decisive, scholarly, and vivid writing gained in reputation, however, especially her wartime essays on Jane Austen. When her husband delineated his definitive line of English novelists in <span class="italic">The Great Tradition</span>, he considered that his wife's work made it unnecessary to include a chapter on Austen.<br>
<br>In 1946 cancer was diagnosed, from which Leavis suffered in the post-war years. In the 1960s, however, her powers returned, and she was asked to teach for the English tripos at several Cambridge colleges. She visited Harvard University with her husband, which resulted in an important essay on Emily Bront&euml; in their joint book <span class="italic">Lectures in America</span> (1969). Another collaboration, <span class="italic">Dickens the Novelist</span> (1970), followed. She was afflicted again by cancer and the burns received from radium treatment. In 1977 F. R. Leavis's health began to fail: although not strong, she nursed him at home until his death in the spring of 1978. As a widow Leavis began work on a memoir of her husband, but she also lectured widely in schools and universities on novelists in the English and other traditions. Her last lecture, for the Cheltenham festival of 1980, was &#145;The Englishness of the English novel&#146;. She knew well the work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, on whom she was preparing in her last weeks to lecture. She died of heart failure in Cambridge on 17 March 1981.<br>
<br>Q. D. Leavis was an important critic of the novel, English, American, and European, on which three posthumous volumes of essays were published. Personally she was vivacious and combative, with passionately held dislikes and likes. She had a strong visual sense, for clothes, house decoration, and book illustration. As an undergraduate she delighted in the novels of Henry James, she herself possessing some of the directness of an early James heroine.<br>
