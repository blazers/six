<span class="headword">Bird,  Francis</span>  (1667&#150;1731), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Nothing is known of his parentage. He enjoyed an exceptionally cosmopolitan sculptural education: at the age of eleven he was sent to Flanders to train, where, according to Vertue, he worked under a statuary named Cozins; he later travelled to Rome, but his movements there are unclear. When he returned to London, aged about twenty-two, he was employed in the workshops of Grinling Gibbons and Caius Gabriel Cibber. In this period he probably took a number of independent monumental commissions, most notably the monument to Dr Richard Busby in Westminster Abbey (1695). Despite his youthful successes, Bird does not appear to have regarded his continental training as complete: about 1695 he returned to Rome and spent nine months in the workshop of Pierre Legros. He made a number of other visits to Rome in his lifetime.<br>
<br>Bird was back in London by 1700, and some time in 1707 he married Hester (<i>c</i>.1680&#150;<i>c</i>.1767), the daughter of Edward Chapman, a stone mason and contractor with a yard at Red Lion Square, and his wife, Margaret Wilcock (or Wilcox). They had five daughters and a son: Margaret (1713&#150;1795), Clare, a Mrs Dickinson, Hester (1722&#150;1809), Anne, and Edward Chapman (<i>c</i>.1715&#150;1792). After his return Bird built a more sustained independent career. A sign of his rise to prominence was the award of the commission to design and carve most, if not all, of the figurative embellishments over the west portal of Wren's St Paul's Cathedral. In December 1706 his shop completed work on the great pediment, providing a scene of the conversion of St Paul of 64 feet in length. This work accorded with a fine model by the sculptor which is now preserved among the cathedral's collection of antiquities. Bird's shop continued to work on figures for the exterior of the cathedral until 1721, its master receiving a total payment for the work of &pound;2040.<br>
<br>Between 1711 and 1712 Bird's workshop produced its most publicly conspicuous work, the marble statue of Queen Anne, towering over four feminine figures symbolic of the extent of her dominion, which stood before the great western staircase to the cathedral. A Victorian copy of this monument, by Richard Belt, now stands in place of Bird's original, which has survived, much damaged, in what was once the garden of Augustus Hare at Holmehurst, near Hastings. While his shop was carving the monument to Queen Anne, Bird received his greatest funerary commission, the tomb of John Holles, duke of Newcastle (<i>d</i>. 1711), for Westminster Abbey. This towering pile, commissioned by Henrietta, countess of Oxford, was designed by James Gibbs and featured as an engraved illustration in the latter's <span class="italic">Book of Architecture</span> of 1728. After completing this great commission Bird took on a series of monuments in the abbey: those to the memory of Admiral Henry Priestman (<i>d</i>. 1712), Sidney, first earl of Godolphin (<i>d</i>. 1712), Thomas Sprat, dean of Westminster (<i>d</i>. 1713), and Admiral John Baker (<i>d</i>. 1716). Bird's dominance over the figurative sculpture market was even more clear in Oxford than in London. For a period between 1717 and 1721 he sustained a virtual monopoly over sculptural commissions within the patronage of that city's university and colleges. The fine figures of Dr Radcliffe (1717; University College) and Lord Clarendon (1721; Clarendon Buildings) remain among the most conspicuous evidence of the quality of his productions.<br>
<br>Despite his extensive experience of continental sculpture, Bird was unable to sustain the attention of fashionable cosmopolitan society in London. Always a designer of baroque verve, he fell behind the pace of fashion in the 1720s when noted aristocratic connoisseurs demanded a more rigorous pursuit of ancient classical precedent. The end of Bird's dominance was spelt in 1720, when a wave of newly arrived Flemish sculptors, schooled in strict adherence to the antique, began to win the most prestigious contracts. He was passed over for an important Westminster Abbey funerary commission, that to John Sheffield, first duke of Buckingham: two sculptors who had recently been employed in Bird's shop, Peter Scheemakers and Laurent Delveaux, executed this work, and their ascending stars were to eclipse that of their former master. By 1722 the architect James Gibbs had transferred his favours to another recently arrived Fleming, Michael Rysbrack. Hence Bird proved capable of acquiring only the occasional grand monumental commissions, such as that to the memory of the Cavendish family at Bolsover in Derbyshire (1728). However, his monument to Dr Grabe (erected after 1727) shows that there were still opportunities for him to make use of a figure composition based on late baroque Roman formats in the context of Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Bird was also a dealer in Italian marbles. He was appointed one of the directors of Kneller's art academy in 1711. Bird and his father-in-law, both Catholics, were forced to register their estates following the Jacobite rising of 1715. Edward Chapman died in 1729, leaving most of his estate to his daughter and son-in-law; this was of considerable value and included an estate in Windsor. At Christmas 1729 Bird suffered a serious accident: he slipped while leaving a tavern and broke his leg, which was badly set. A long illness followed, ending his career. He died of dropsy on 27 February 1731, aged sixty-four, and was buried in a vault in the church of St Andrew's, Holborn. His wife survived him and lived to the age of eighty-seven. The sale of Bird's possessions took place twenty years after his death, on 30 April 1751 at Langfords, Covent Garden, and included a considerable collection of prints, drawings, and models. His son, Edward, followed his father into the marble and stone-carving business and became one of the most notable marble dealers of mid-eighteenth-century London. E. C. Bird was, however, not able to sustain the fortunes of his family and became bankrupt in 1770, there being a sale of the entire stock of his Westminster yard on 4 April 1771.<br>
<br>Bird was for about a decade between 1710 and 1720 the most prestigious figurative sculptor working in London. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of 1731 celebrated him as the sculptor of &#145;many lofty tombs and magnificent monuments in Westminster Abbey and other places&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 1, 1731, 83). He may be counted one of a line of English-born sculptors who, through training abroad, succeeded in competing with the technically accomplished immigrants from Europe.<br>
