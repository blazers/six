<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dent family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1820&#150;1927), <span class="occ">Far East merchants</span>, came to prominence with the brothers Thomas, Lancelot, and Wilkinson Dent, respectively the third, fifth, and sixth sons of William Dent (1762&#150;1801), merchant, and Jane Wilkinson (<i>bap</i>. 1763, <i>d</i>. 1840), of Trainlands, Crosby Ravensworth, Westmorland, who had married in 1791; there were in all six sons and one daughter. There is a suggestion that William and his brother Robert were in Canton (Guangzhou) at some point between 1787 and 1796. The Dent family had a financially solid background and provided substantial benefactions locally, including funds for the rebuilding and endowment of Crosby Ravensworth village school in 1784. Links with the Wilkinson family were particularly strong and when William died, leaving an extremely young and large family, Thomas Wilkinson, possibly a London insurance broker and agent, took at least some of the boys under his wing.<br>
<br>The third son, <a name="cosubject_61644"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Dent</span>  (1796&#150;1872), was born on 21 December 1796 at Crosby Ravensworth, Westmorland, and was schooled in London. After three terms at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1815&#150;16, he went to Canton, where by 1820 he was exercising powers of attorney on behalf of the absent merchant W. S. Davidson. By 1823 he had formally joined forces with Davidson and an American, William Blight, to trade as W. S. Davidson &amp; Co. Following Davidson's retirement to London, Dent became the senior partner and by 1824 the firm had changed its name to Thomas Dent &amp; Co. In order to legitimize his trade as a private merchant in Canton in the face of the East India Company's monopoly, Dent followed a well-established practice and between 1824 and 1829 he acted as the Sardinian consul. With his younger brother now entrenched in the business he left Canton for London in 1830 to develop the family interest in Rickards, Mackintosh &amp; Co. He finally abandoned his residual role in the Canton partnership when he joined the London firm known from 1835 as Palmer, Mackillop, Dent &amp; Co. Consorting in business with the impressive Horsley Palmer, a governor of the Bank of England (1830&#150;33), Dent clearly aspired to the role of a City grandee himself but was not to be accorded the laurels he sought. His attempt to become a director of the Bank of England when he assumed leadership of Dent, Palmer &amp; Co. in 1858 was frustrated. On 19 January 1837 at St George's, Hanover Square, London, he married Sabine Ellen Robarts, and they had eight sons. He died on 19 November 1872, at 12 Hyde Park Gardens, London, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>The fifth son, <a name="cosubject_61645"></a><span class="headword">Lancelot Dent</span>  (1799&#150;1853), was born on 4 August 1799 at Crosby Ravensworth, Westmorland, and appears to have been engaged initially in the wine trade. He is recorded in 1824 as a partner in Messrs Keirs &amp; Co. of Madeira, yet by 1827 he had arrived in Canton. Under his leadership the firm evolved from its status as a barely tolerated participant in the &#145;country trade&#146;, on the fringes of the East India Company's monopoly, to that of the second largest China trading house making its constructive contribution to the institutions of local commerce and society. He successfully navigated the firm through the uncertainties resulting from the ending of the East India Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 and ensured that it exploited the main chance then presented. By the late 1830s, following the return to Britain of William Jardine, Lancelot Dent was regarded as the senior British merchant in Canton. From no. 6 Pao shun hong he presided over a burgeoning trade which included imports of raw cotton, manufactured goods, and, most famously and illegally, opium; exports of tea and silk; and the range of attendant insurance and banking services typical of an agency house.<br>
<br>Lancelot Dent combined an unusual attention to detail bordering on pedantry, with sufficient large-mindedness and affability to secure greater popularity than his brother Thomas. His moderate temperament, finding expression in the firm's mouthpiece, <span class="italic">The Canton Press</span>, sprang from a tory political sympathy, a respect for the stable framework provided by the East India Company, and a practical recognition that coercive measures against the Chinese to expand trading opportunities could be counter-productive. As a prime mover in the establishment of the Canton general chamber of commerce in 1836 he helped to reduce divisiveness within the merchant community, and his leadership of and benefaction to the Morrison Education Society (founded in the same year) fostered, in a modest way, greater mutual understanding between Chinese and Western cultures.<br>
<br>The painting by George Chinnery <span class="italic">On Dent's Verandah</span>, executed about 1840, well evokes the languorous interludes between the Canton trading seasons when Dent would decamp for his well-appointed residence on Mac&atilde;o's Praya Grande. This pattern was to be rudely interrupted when the Chinese imperial government intensified its intermittent attempts to end the opium trade with the appointment in 1838 of Lin Zexu as high commissioner for Canton. Faced with Lin's summons to an interview at Canton's city gates, urgently reinforced on 23 March 1839 by the appearance of two leading Chinese Cohong merchants in chains, Dent would have acceded if not prevented by fellow merchants afraid both for his safety and for the possible surrender of opium stocks. The situation was saved only by the arrival in Canton of Captain Elliot, the British government's superintendent of trade. With the disruption of trade caused by the ensuing First Opium War (1839&#150;42), Lancelot Dent possibly moved at least a part of his operations to Manila, where he had acquired a house. As the firm became established in Hong Kong, gaining a substantial foothold near Pedders Wharf in the first land sale of 1841, and extending its operations into the newly acquired treaty ports, Dent's role diminished. On his return to England by 1842, he retired to the Skersgill estate in Cumberland. He died, unmarried, at the Plough Hotel, Cheltenham, on 28 November 1853. Reporting his death the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> noted he was the head of an eminent house in China which bore his name, and added that &#145;He was the type of a true English merchant&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 217). He was buried in St Lawrence's churchyard, Crosby Ravensworth.<br>
<br>Born on 24 December 1800 at Crosby Ravensworth, <a name="cosubject_61646"></a><span class="headword">Wilkinson Dent</span>  (1800&#150;1886) was in many respects a lesser man of business than his elder brothers, and his arrival in Canton was by a more circuitous route. Unsuccessful in Europe, he showed no greater promise in Calcutta. He departed in 1835 for Canton where by the year end Lancelot Dent had secured a partnership for him in Daniell &amp; Co., hoping ultimately to effect a takeover (which never materialized). Present at Lancelot's discomfiture of 23 March 1839, Wilkinson Dent was a key restraining influence on his brother's readiness to leave the factories and face Lin. It was the Hong Kong branch of the firm which subsequently became his base. On his return to England, Wilkinson Dent lived at Flass House, Maulds Meaburn, Westmorland, which he and Lancelot had reconstructed with the fruits of their Far Eastern endeavours. The nearby church of St Lawrence, Crosby Ravensworth, was equipped with a chapel dedicated to the Dent family in 1871, funded by Wilkinson. He too died a bachelor, on 10 May 1886, at the family residence, 8 Fitzroy Square, London. He was buried near his brother in St Lawrence's churchyard.<br>
<br>Unfortunately a degree of complacency set in after the death or retirement of the three brothers, and the firm collapsed in 1867. A nephew, John Dent (1821&#150;1892), had a lifestyle that certainly suggested extravagance (he was reported to have spent &pound;10,000 on a racehorse to win the Hong Kong cup) but the firm's achievements, principally in the leading role it played in the establishment of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, were still registered and failure was poignant when it came.<br>
<br>&#145;It was a bitter moment when we had to haul down the old house flag&#146;  (Lubbock, 373), recalled <a name="cosubject_61647"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alfred Dent</span>  (1844&#150;1927), who was responsible for restoring the family fortunes. Born on 12 December 1844, the third son of Thomas Dent, he was educated at Eton College between 1858 and 1862, and was in the firm's employ on the China coast by 1864. Soon after the crash he had the business, reconstituted as Alfred Dent &amp; Co., operational once more in the old Shanghai premises. He was, however, to make a spectacular departure from the time-honoured Dent career path. With Alfred's financial backing the Austro-Hungarian Herr van Overbeek, a former manager of Dent &amp; Brothers in Hong Kong, succeeded in extracting commercial concessions from the sultan of Brunei and the Pangiran Temanggong in the face of American, Spanish, and Italian competition. The treaty sealing these arrangements in 1877 resulted in Overbeek's becoming maharaja of Saba and raja of Gaya and Sandakan. It was Dent's long-standing friendship with Sir Julian Pauncefote, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, which provided support against the resulting complaints of Raja Brooke to which the colonial secretary, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, had lent a sympathetic ear. Dent bought out Overbeek's interest in 1880 and, following the grant of a royal charter the following year, the British North Borneo Company was created with sovereign rights over the territories formerly in Overbeek's charge. For &pound;120,000 Dent transferred all his rights to it. One of the provinces created for administrative purposes was named Dent.<br>
<br>Sir Alfred Dent was to broaden his activities even further. Head of the City firm of Dent Brothers &amp; Co., merchants and commission agents, he also became chairman of the Caledonian (Ceylon) Tea Estates, and the Shanghai Electric Construction Company, and held directorships of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, the London County and Westminster Bank, and the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation. In 1898 he was appointed to the Indian silver currency commission. His wide-ranging achievements were recognized by his knighthood (KCMG) in 1892 and his appointment as high sheriff of Sussex in 1908.<br>
<br>Something of a sportsman Dent pursued recreations such as rowing, tennis, hunting, and shooting. He married late, in 1896, Margaret, the daughter of Charles Aird; they had one son, Lesley. Dent's London addresses included Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, and, later, 10 Cambridge Gate, Regent's Park; he also favoured his country house, Ravensworth, in Eastbourne. Sir Alfred died on 23 November 1927 at his home in Cambridge Gate, and he was buried in Ocklynge cemetery, Eastbourne. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Managers of a business partnership which played a major role in the expansion of British trade in the Far East, the Dent family provided an outstanding example of economic imperialism at work. At its height the firm rivalled the now better-known Jardine Matheson partnership for supremacy of the old China trade. Unfortunately, the presumed loss of the Dent business records has radically distorted historical accounts of the opening of trade with China in favour of Jardines, whose archive is still largely intact and readily accessible to scholars.<br>
