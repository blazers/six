<span class="headword">Baynes,  Norman Hepburn</span>  (1877&#150;1961), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Putney, London, on 29 May 1877, the elder child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47624/', "Alfred Henry Baynes (1838&#150;1914)")</script>, general secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society, and his wife, Emma Katherine Bigwood (<i>d</i>. 1935). He lived in London, then in Eastbourne, moving to Northwood in Middlesex on his father's retirement in 1906. He never married and after his father's death in 1914 he continued to live in Northwood with his mother until she died in 1935, when he eventually settled in London. Brought up in a close-knit and devoted family circle, he enjoyed a sheltered and happy childhood and at the same time had instilled into him a strong sense of public duty and Christian purpose. He went to Eastbourne College for which, despite his intense dislike of organized games, he retained throughout his life a strong affection, though his surviving papers and later personal recollections indicated that the formative influence in his life was his family circle.<br>
<br>Baynes's diaries contain a wealth of factual detail on family holidays and later, as a young man, travel abroad, particularly a visit to Constantinople where he and his father met Sir Edwin Pears. He spent some months in T&uuml;bingen gaining considerable mastery of the German language. At New College, Oxford, he took a first class in classical honour moderations (1898), but a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1900). He was bitterly disappointed at not getting a first, though the more mature judgement of later years admitted that this had been a fair assessment, for he recognized that he was no philosopher. His powers as a historian were, however, shown by his success in winning the Lothian prize (1901) and the Arnold essay prize (1903). In both cases the subject (Heraclius, and then the military reforms of Diocletian and Constantine), as well as entries in his diaries, indicated his growing interest in East Rome. But he first chose as his profession the bar, studying in the chambers of R. J. Parker (later Lord Parker of Waddington); he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1903; and until 1916 he was a tutor under the Law Society.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Baynes worked on intelligence matters at Watergate House. It was at this time that he finally decided to abandon the law and turn to the teaching of history. He had already refused an invitation to stand for a Liberal seat in the London area, and in 1913 he had forged his first link with University College, London, when he was appointed assistant in the department of history. After the war he refused an invitation to return as a don to his Oxford college. Indeed he always prided himself on being a cockney and a member of the University of London. In 1919 he became a reader in the history of the Roman empire in the University of London and from 1931 he held a personal chair of Byzantine history; in 1936 he was elected a fellow of University College; from 1937 he gave up all duties in ancient history and was reappointed to an honorary professorship of Byzantine history and institutions. On his retirement in 1942 he was given the title of emeritus professor by the university and was presented by his friends with an <span class="italic">Address and Bibliography</span> of his writings (privately printed).<br>
<br>During the last years of his academic career Baynes worked in Oxford in the foreign research and press service, for he found it impossible to concentrate on academic work during a time of world crisis. Therefore from 1939 to 1945 he used his historical training in the field of modern German history and produced two large, fully annotated volumes of Hitler's pre-war speeches (1942). The depth of his involvement in the national struggle was demonstrated by his choice of subject for his Romanes lecture in Oxford in June 1942: &#145;Intellectual liberty and totalitarian claims&#146;; its delivery was said to have been a brilliant caricature of the oratory of the F&uuml;hrer on whose speeches he had been working. In 1945 he returned to London and to Byzantine studies. On his seventieth birthday the <span class="italic">Journal of Roman Studies</span> (vol. 37, 1947, with a bibliography of his writings) was dedicated to him. He spent much time editing in his own impeccable way a volume of essays on Byzantium (1948), planned more than twenty years earlier, and he collaborated with E. A. S. Dawes to translate the lives of three early Byzantine saints (1948). But he did little of the major work planned, notably a social history of East Rome, because of increasing illness, finally culminating in several years of complete helplessness.<br>
<br>Baynes's interests as a scholar covered a wide range from biblical history to the early middle ages, but he came increasingly to concentrate on the late Roman and early Byzantine periods and is perhaps best known for his work on Constantine I (Raleigh lecture, 1929) and the <span class="italic">Historia Augusta</span> (1926). He contributed chapters on the sixth- and seventh-century Byzantine emperors to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Medieval History</span> (vols. 1 and 2) and was one of the editors of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span> (vol. 12), as well as a contributor on Constantine. Much of his work took the form of reviews or bibliographical notes (many for the <span class="italic">Byzantinische Zeitschrift</span>), often subjected to ruthless editorial pruning. He was never afraid to combine his exact scholarship with imaginative reconstruction, unlike J. B. Bury, whom he knew and admired, although he realized Bury's inadequacies, as he showed in the perceptive appraisal in his memoir of him (<span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, 1929). In contrast to Bury, Baynes had the power of vivid reconstruction, bringing Byzantium to life for the uninitiated, as his masterly short study of the <span class="italic">Byzantine Empire</span> (1925) well illustrates. His published work in the academic field was often controversial, but always stimulating and marked by intellectual integrity. The full extent of his activities can best be realized from his continuous stream of correspondence with contemporary scholars, including names such as Delehaye, Ensslin, Stein, Bidez, Gr&eacute;goire, and D&ouml;lger. He was almost over-fastidious in his approach and often put as much work into his letters, or his reviews and biographical notes, as others put into an article or chapter of a book. But in all he did or said he remained essentially a Victorian individualist to whom the elimination of &#145;alternatives&#146; was unthinkable.<br>
<br>Baynes's influence can never be fully assessed. Above all he valued friendship and he had a genius for making contacts in every walk of life. He had an extensive circle of friends ranging from his non-graduate evening students and his Ancient History Circle to the more severely academic dons invited to the weekend meetings of his Near East Group. Surviving correspondence and press cuttings illustrate the range of lectures, social evenings, discussions, and play-readings which flourished in the stimulating atmosphere he created. From an early age he had been a gifted performer as a comedian and he was always ready to improvise his unrivalled comic turns, whether in his family circle, or in aid of charities, or to amuse soldiers in wartime hospitals. He had a magnificent presence and was a master of Victorian oratory as well as of exact scholarship. In later years he rarely left England, but on his infrequent visits to congresses abroad he created such an impression that he was long remembered not only as a scholar but as a splendid critic and fierce opponent in debate who could yet remain &#145;an English gentleman&#146;.<br>
<br>Baynes was elected FBA in 1930, an honorary fellow of Westfield College, London (1937), and of New College, Oxford (1947), a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (1937), and later of the Belgian (1952) and Serbian (1959) academies. He was doctor <i>honoris causa</i> of the universities of St Andrews (1934), Oxford (1942), Durham (1946), Cambridge (1949), and London (1951). He died at his home, 4B Abercorn Place, St John's Wood, London, on 12 February 1961.<br>
