<span class="headword">Stringfellow,  John</span>  (1799&#150;1883), <span class="occ">bobbin manufacturer and aeronautical engineer</span>, was born in Attercliffe, near Sheffield, on 6 December 1799, the son of William Stringfellow, cutler, and his wife, Martha. His father was a man of wide scientific interests from whom he inherited a considerable degree of mechanical aptitude and ingenuity.<br>
<br>At an early age Stringfellow was apprenticed to the lace trade in Nottingham, but about 1820 moved to Chard in Somerset, a centre of lace making, and was so successful that within a few years he had established his own business as a manufacturer of bobbins and bobbin carriages. Thus provided with a steady income, he was able to devote much of his time to aeronautical experiments and other scientific pursuits.<br>
<br>In 1831 and again in 1832 Stringfellow launched hot-air balloons at local festivals, one of which flew a distance of more than 4 miles, but even at that time his goal was powered flight with fixed-wing aeroplanes. The idea was developed in discussions with another manufacturer of lace-making machinery who had moved to Chard in the late 1830s, William Samuel Henson (1812&#150;1888), and was inspired by the aeronautical writings and experiments of Sir George Cayley. Henson and Stringfellow began testing various wing forms in model gliders, and by 1840 had evolved their projected full-size passenger-carrying flying machine or &#145;aerial steam carriage&#146;, which Henson patented in April 1843.<br>
<br>A 20 foot wingspan model powered by a steam engine, of Henson origin but much improved by Stringfellow, was tested in 1845 but could not sustain itself in the air. Henson then abandoned his aeronautical ambitions altogether. Stringfellow persevered on his own, however, and built another 10 foot model powered by a smaller steam engine of his own design. More than one witness recalled that it gained height steadily after being launched on several occasions in 1848, and Stringfellow himself certainly considered that he had demonstrated with it the possibility of powered flight.<br>
<br>Stringfellow then built a number of other model aeroplanes and engines before entering a model steam-powered triplane and a model steam engine in the aeronautical exhibition at Crystal Palace in June 1868. His steam engine was awarded a prize of &pound;100 by the Royal Aeronautical Society for having the greatest power-to-weight ratio of all the fifteen engines exhibited, but unfortunately the triplane could never be tested in the still-air conditions to which it was suited, and so never proved itself to be, if indeed it was, a practical flying machine.<br>
<br>Stringfellow was an outstanding designer and builder of small lightweight steam engines, but his model aeroplanes suffered from the twin disadvantages of being too large to be fully tested indoors, and not stable enough to be tested out of doors. It is remarkable, however, that his fixed-wing propeller-driven models showed the way ahead so clearly at a time when most other proposals for aerial machines involved flapping wings or unlikely applications of the helicopter principle.<br>
<br>In the late 1850s Stringfellow took up the new art of photography, becoming so proficient that he advertised himself as a professional portrait photographer, with a studio in Chard High Street. He was elected a member of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1868, and with his prize money erected a building 70 feet long in which to continue his experiments, but his sight began to fail and he was unable to make any further progress. He patented in 1870 a wheeled apparatus for affording protection from bullets and other missiles, but did not succeed in selling it to any of Europe's warring armies.<br>
<br>On 24 February 1827 Stringfellow married Hannah Keetch, said to have been born in Newfoundland. Their surviving family consisted of six sons and four daughters. Stringfellow died in High Street, Chard, on 13 December 1883.<br>
