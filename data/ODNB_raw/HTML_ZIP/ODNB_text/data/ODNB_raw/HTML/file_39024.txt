<span class="headword">Lucas,  Joseph</span>  (1834&#150;1902), <span class="occ">lamp manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 April 1834 at Carver Street, Birmingham, the eldest son of Benjamin Lucas, a plater, and his wife, Catharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ball. He received his basic education, probably only on Sundays, at a school attached to the church of the Saviour in Edward Street, Birmingham, run by the non-denominational Unitarian minister George Dawson, who was the first to articulate the notion of civic enterprise and to find in Joseph Chamberlain its greatest disciple. At the age of about thirteen, Joseph Lucas followed his father and was apprenticed to H. and G. R. Elkington, a firm of Birmingham silversmiths; he served seven years before qualifying as an electro-plater journeyman by the time of his first marriage, to Emily Stevens (<i>d</i>. 1885), on 20 July 1854. Over the next eleven years they had six children, his eldest son, Harry, becoming his lifelong business partner.<br>
<br>In 1860 Lucas began in business, selling buckets, shovels, and other items of hollow ware door-to-door, which led in 1869 to his first entry in White's <span class="italic">Birmingham Directory</span> as a dealer in lamps and oils. As business prospered, Lucas took on a small three-storey terraced house, 209 Great King Street, and in 1872 seventeen-year-old Harry Lucas joined his father. Within three years they had set up the Tom Bowling lamp works in Little King Street, Birmingham, producing a lamp of the same name for the fishing industry. Both were agreed on the need to find a more profitable adjunct to lamp oil, which had been selling well after fish oil had been replaced by paraffin and petroleum in the late 1850s. Their decision to concentrate on lamps which would burn the new fuel turned out to be an astute move. The growing popularity of the bicycle created an unprecedented demand for lamps, and Lucas was quick to realize that if he was to make any impression on this new market he would have to make the move from trader to manufacturer. In 1878, when laws were being passed requiring bicycles to carry lamps after dusk, Lucas decided on his first cycle lamp, the &#145;King of the Road&#146;. It was certainly a gamble, since the bicycle was still expensive, difficult to handle, and many years from becoming universally popular. Even though Lucas was running his business very much on a hand-to-mouth basis, he had enough confidence to take advantage of the growing number of cycling clubs springing up all over the country. In 1880 he was granted a patent for his new lamp, nicknamed &#145;His Majesty&#146;, and in the same year the first signs of interest were shown from across the Atlantic. In the spring of 1881, the first consignment of King of the Road lamps was shipped to the States.<br>
<br>In 1882, after ten years in the business, Harry was brought into formal partnership, creating the firm of Joseph Lucas &amp; Son. It was a difficult period for both men. Joseph's wife died, aged fifty-two, in February 1885, and he married, with some haste, his 51-year-old widowed cousin, Maria Tyzack, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas (<i>d</i>. 1900), in November of the same year. The new business partnership also had to deal with stresses relating to cash flow and the potentially more serious threat from infringement of patent rights. Joseph Lucas was never slow to invoke the law if his designs were being pirated, but being litigious only served to detract from harnessing trade in a still fickle market. With this in mind, Lucas typically ensured that his lamp designs kept in fine tune with bicycling trends.<br>
<br>The development of the first pneumatic tyre for bicycles, patented in 1888 by a Belfast veterinary surgeon, John Boyd Dunlop, put paid to the &#145;boneshaker&#146;, and transformed the bicycle industry. Cycling now became a popular pastime for countless people and, in 1891, Lucas launched the Tom Bowling Lamp Works Cycling Club for the benefit of staff members. However, it was becoming increasingly obvious that if he was to take full advantage of the expanding business, Lucas would need to build new premises. Funds being in as short supply as floor space, Lucas decided to form a public limited company to raise the necessary capital to finance the building of a five-storey factory close to the original site in Little King Street. In 1892 the firm of Joseph Lucas &amp; Son Ltd was incorporated, with Joseph as chairman, and himself and his son Harry as joint managing directors. The new company, with 700 personnel on the payroll, appointed Walter Chamberlain, youngest son of Joseph Chamberlain, to the board. Walter, who was then working for Nettlefolds, was to be part of the team that ran the company throughout the Edwardian years and into the age of the motor car. In 1895, Lucas patented perhaps his most profitable accessory, the legendary Silver King of the Road, which remained the company's best-selling line over the next decades. After 1898, the influence of the company having spread beyond the midlands, he opened an office in Holborn, London.<br>
<br>Lucas showed a great deal of kindness towards members of staff, and certain people who had displayed great loyalty over the years were remembered in his will. He was a great exponent of the views of George Dawson, who held that public service was a religious duty. But, as a devout teetotaller, abstinence was the order of the day. Lucas would have no truck with an inebriated worker and had no compunction in dismissing without notice anyone found smelling of alcohol. He had been a member of the Birmingham Temperance Society since 1877, and in 1888 was elected to the board of directors of the Temperance Hall Company. Through his munificence the hall was rebuilt and in October 1901 Joseph Chamberlain, the secretary of state for the colonies, performed the opening ceremony. Ironically, Lucas died of typhoid fever at the Hotel Bristol, Naples, on 27 December 1902, after the ship he was sailing in called at the port. Had he drunk the wine and kept off the local water he might not have fallen ill.<br>
<br>Lucas was survived by his third wife, Mary Anne (<i>b</i>. 1850/51), daughter of Samuel Owen, whom he had married on 30 July 1901, just one year after the death of his second wife. He left the bulk of his estate to his wife, children, and grandchildren, but he set aside &pound;4000 to enable a special trust to be set up for &#145;the diffusion and promotion of the principles and practice of total abstinence from alcoholic liquors among the inhabitants of the city of Birmingham and its neighbourhood&#146;. Lucas was buried at Moseley parish church, Worcestershire, on 14 January 1903.<br>
