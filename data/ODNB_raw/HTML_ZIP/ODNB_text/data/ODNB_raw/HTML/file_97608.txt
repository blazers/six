<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lympany <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Johnstone]</span>, Dame  Moura</span>  (1916&#150;2005), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born Mary Gertrude Johnstone at Greenbank Villa, Saltash, Cornwall, on 18 August 1916, the daughter of John Johnstone, then serving as a captain in the Australian infantry, and his wife, Beatrice Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Limpenny. Her father, later an insurance agent, was frequently absent. The greatest influence was her mother, who spoke seven languages, had been a governess in Russia before her marriage, and taught piano and cello. From her Mary inherited a sharp business acumen and a keen sense of adventure. The latter quality stood her in good stead when she left England for a convent school in Belgium at the age of six. Any sense of loneliness or isolation was countered by her growing awareness of her instinctive talent. Cherished but occasionally chided by the nuns (her exuberance was sometimes viewed as a product of &#145;the sin of pride&#146;) she astonished all who heard her with a performance of Liszt's ultra-virtuoso E major polonaise. Her return to England (where she attended Our Lady of Sion convent school in Kensington) was marked by her d&eacute;but in Harrogate where, aged twelve, she played the Mendelssohn G minor concerto, a work for which she retained a lifelong affection. It was the conductor of that performance, Basil Cameron, who suggested she change her name to Moura Lympany, an ingenious alteration reflecting her mother's love of all things Russian and her Cornish origins (Limpenny being an old Cornish name).<br>
<br>After her triumph in Harrogate, Lympany studied at the Royal Academy of Music for three years (winning the Challen gold medal), then for a year in Vienna under Paul Weingarten. After a creditable performance in the first Liszt competition in Budapest, she returned to the Royal Academy of Music, where she studied under Mathilde Verne (who had taught Solomon Cutner, otherwise Solomon) and, most importantly, Tobias Matthay, whose influence was at the heart of her legendary fluency and musicianship. Maxims like &#145;never play faster than you can think&#146;, a quiet but firm insistence on relaxation, and, above all, naturalness of line, impetus, and phrasing became central to her musical outlook.<br>
<br>Always enterprising and wide-ranging in her choice of repertory, Lympany followed a performance of the Grieg concerto in 1932 with one of the Delius concerto and Vincent d'Indy's <span class="italic">Symphonie c&eacute;venole</span> and also gave a triumphant Wigmore Hall d&eacute;but recital in 1935. She achieved international acclaim when she won second prize in Belgium's Queen Elizabeth competition in 1938, a time when competitions were few and mattered supremely. The youngest of seventy-nine competitors, she gave a performance of the Liszt E flat concerto that was of such freshness and agility that it deflected the jury's interest from other already celebrated pianists including Yakov Flier and Arturo Michelangeli. Only Emil Gilels excelled her in the final result. Her Proms d&eacute;but quickly followed, and in 1940 she commenced her long association with the Khachaturian concerto, an exotic showpiece initially offered to Clifford Curzon who, daunted by the amount of time needed to master both its character and its intricacy, reputedly said, &#145;send it to Moura, she learns so quickly&#146;  (private information). Recorded for Decca with Anatole Fistoulari conducting, this concerto was an outstanding item in Lympany's discography, as was the first of three recordings of the complete Rachmaninov preludes. Performances of Rachmaninov's first three concertos, the Paganini rhapsody, and the second sonata (in the 1931 revision) became part of her stock-in-trade, but so too were her performances of English music, with premi&egrave;res and appearances in works by Benjamin Dale, Richard Arnell, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, John Ireland, Alan Rawsthorne, and Cyril Scott.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Lympany played regularly at the National Gallery lunchtime concerts, and toured throughout Britain; she was later described as an &#145;indispensable part of wartime musical life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 31 March 2005). She was reputedly the first British musician to perform in Paris after the liberation, playing Rawsthorne's first concerto, though she was at this time particularly known for her interpretations of Russian music. On 30 May 1944 she married, as his second wife, Colin Defries, an aircraft engineer and amateur pianist thirty-two years her senior, and son of Daniel Colman Defries, mechanical engineer. The marriage was short-lived, and ended in divorce in 1950. On 10 August the following year she married Bennet Henry Korn (<i>d</i>. 1989), a 37-year-old American radio advertising, later television, executive, and son of Samuel Korn, hat manufacturer. She suffered two miscarriages, one of twins, before giving birth to a premature son who lived for thirty-five hours. There were no surviving children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1961.<br>
<br>In contrast to her private life, Lympany enjoyed triumph after triumph in her post-war musical career. She built up a considerable following not only in Britain but in Europe and the United States, where she made her d&eacute;but in 1948, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. For much of her life she was constantly on the move. She nevertheless found time to refine her technique (taking lessons with Eduard Steuermann, the pupil and interpreter of Schoenberg, in the 1950s) and to expand her repertory. She remained particularly associated with Russian music, but also became known for her interpretations of Beethoven, Brahms, and Schumann, as well as of the contemporary British composers whom she championed. Her recordings were both numerous and popular.<br>
<br>Constantly clarifying and refining her art, Lympany had little use for exaggeration and surplus display, or for lurid bursts of speed. She aimed, she said, &#145;to play straight, nothing chichi, not what I call powdered rubato. And never to bang the keys&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 31 March 2005). In the words of one American critic, she was &#145;a virtuoso of dreaming&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 30 March 2005). Energy born of single-mindedness and an iron will to succeed were central to her success, and she rarely sacrificed her daily stint of four hours' practice even when interrupted by her incessant travels. Resilience was in the broadest sense the keynote to her life. Beset with serious illness and personal unhappiness, she resolved never to look back. Returning to the Wigmore Hall after a mastectomy in 1970 she regaled her audience with the story of her invitation to her music-loving surgeon to her Royal Festival Hall performance of Ravel's left-hand concerto only to receive an anxious letter asking her to confirm which part of her he had removed.<br>
<br>Moura Lympany was never easily tolerant, and could sometimes be surprisingly vain: when invited to be a castaway on <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> she chose eight of her own recordings. Yet her warmth and sympathy were proverbial and she always showed the keenest interest in younger generations. Her autobiography, published in 1991, was more fluffy than substantial. She was appointed CBE in 1979 and DBE in 1992. Among many other awards both British and foreign, she was made a commander of the order of the Crown in Belgium in 1980, a chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France in 1992, and a member of the order of Prince Henry the Navigator in Portugal in 1996. Latterly she divided her time between London, Monaco, and Rasigu&egrave;res in Languedoc, where she owned a vineyard and between 1981 and 1992 ran an annual festival of music and wine that attracted artists of the calibre of Victoria de Los Angeles and Elizabeth Harwood. She continued playing until her eighties, and was much acclaimed in the United States as well as in Europe. She died in Menton, France, on 28 March 2005. A service of thanksgiving was held at the church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London, on 7 June.<br>
