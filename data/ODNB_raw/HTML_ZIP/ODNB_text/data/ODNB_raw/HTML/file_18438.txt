<span class="headword">Maynard,  John</span>  (1600&#150;1665), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Rotherfield, Sussex, and baptized at Mayfield in the same county, on 8 March 1600, the son of a wealthy yeoman. He entered Queen's College, Oxford, on 21 June 1616, and graduated BA on 3 February 1620 as a &#145;grand compounder&#146;. He transferred to Magdalen Hall, and proceeded MA on 26 June 1622.<br>
<br>At that time Maynard owned 19 acres in the manor of Sharendon, Mayfield. On 12 August 1624 he took up the living there, and on 9 February the next year married Margaret, daughter of the previous incumbent, John Luck. Together they had seven children&#151;two sons, John and Richard, and five daughters, most of whom died young. Margaret died on 2 October 1635 after giving birth to twins. Maynard then married, on 28 June 1637, the widowed Mary Withers of St Edmund's parish, Lombard Street, London. Mary was buried at Mayfield on 6 May 1640. She too may have died following childbirth, since a tablet in Southwark Cathedral records the death of her daughter, Margaret, on 14 March 1653, aged thirteen. On 1 April 1642 at St Margaret Moyses, Friday Street, London, Maynard was again married, this time to Mary Wood, of Hackney, Middlesex.<br>
<br>At the opening of hostilities between the king and parliament, according to Wood, Maynard &#145;preached with more liberty&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.892). He took the covenant and on 14 September 1643 was selected as a representative of Sussex to the Westminster assembly of divines, which he regularly attended. On 26 February 1645 he preached before the House of Commons on a fast day and his sermon was subsequently published. At another fast on 28 October 1646 Maynard again addressed the Commons. In this sermon, entitled <span class="italic">A Shadow of the Victory of Christ</span> (1646), he professed his belief that &#145;we are under the seventh trumpet [of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>] &hellip; Now is the time when Christ shall conquer Kingdoms &hellip; to reign over them, forever&#146;  (p. 10).<br>
<br>Maynard was appointed vicar of Camberwell, Surrey, on 21 November 1646. His parishioners petitioned against him on account of his having another living in Sussex, but they were overruled in December. In an undated entry Maynard recorded in the Mayfield parish register that he had offered to give up the tithes of the parish for the maintenance of a minister in his absence, but since no fit person was appointed, &#145;there was no constant minister for sometime, and afterwards divers changes, so that the register was neglected for divers years&#146;  (Lower, 234). However, Maynard deputed Elias Paul D'Aranda, later pastor of the Walloon church in Canterbury Cathedral, to act as a curate with full benefit of the parish tithe. In 1654 Maynard was appointed one of the assistants to the commissioners of Sussex for the ejection of scandalous ministers and schoolmasters. In the late 1650s Maynard is said to have preached out of his home in Camberwell and to have erected a meeting-house there in 1657 after apparently resigning his living.<br>
<br>In 1662 both Maynard and his curate were ejected from Mayfield. He subsequently lived at Cranesden, a farmhouse in Mayfield, until his death on 7 June 1665. He was buried in the churchyard in Mayfield. He was survived by his fourth wife, Ann, daughter of Henry Engham, whom he had married before 7 June 1665; she died on 7 September 1670, and was buried beside her husband. Maynard's <span class="italic">The Young Man's Remembrancer and the Old Man's Monitor</span> had appeared the previous year and a number of his Mayfield sermons were published in 1674, with the encouragement of his son-in-law.<br>
