<span class="headword">Raleigh <span class="st"> [Ralegh]</span>,  William  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1250), <span class="occ">justice, administrator, and bishop of Winchester</span>, came of a prominent Devon family which had several branches and whose members are sometimes difficult to distinguish from one another. In 1212 King John presented him to the church of Bratton Fleming in that county, when he was described as &#145;clerk&#146;. He is first known to have served as a clerk of the bench in 1214, and there are numerous further references to him in that capacity from 1219 to 1229. For at least the latter part of that period, and certainly from 1225, he was the personal clerk of the bench and eyre justice Martin of Pateshull, and left the bench to go on eyre when Pateshull did so, including a circuit in the north in 1226&#150;7, when he also acted as a commissioner for the assessment of tallage. It seems unlikely that he was the same William of Raleigh who was sheriff of Devon from 1225 to 1228; the sheriff was most likely the Devon knight of that name who had probably also served as a coroner immediately before 1225. William of Raleigh the clerk became a justice of the bench in May 1229, following Pateshull's retirement, second only to Stephen of Segrave in seniority, and above Robert of Lexinton, who had been a justice long before him. He inherited Pateshull's rolls, with the preparation of which he had been much concerned, and which later passed to Henry of Bracton, who handed them in to the exchequer in 1257/8. By December 1231 Raleigh's clerk was Roger of Thirkleby, a future justice.<br>
<br>Raleigh took part in an eyre in Middlesex in 1229, and then in seven more eyres elsewhere in 1232/3, in all but the first of which he was the senior justice. He became senior justice of the bench in Michaelmas term 1233, superseding Thomas of Muleton, and remained as such until his appointment in May 1234 as justice of the court <i>coram rege</i>, after the fall of his predecessor, the justiciar Stephen of Segrave. He thus became the most senior of all the king's judges, but without the title of justiciar, that office being allowed to lapse. For the whole of his tenure of office he was the only professional justice in the court, sitting with household stewards and members of the king's council as colleagues. By 1238 Bracton was probably his clerk, perhaps succeeding Thirkleby at about the time of the latter's marriage in 1235 or 1236.<br>
<br>During the next few years Raleigh was a trusted royal counsellor as well as a justice, and in fact between 1236 and 1239 he seems to have been the king's chief adviser, being responsible for at least some of the <span class="roman">Statute of Merton</span> in 1236 and for other legal reforms, and also for a programme of fiscal reforms which tried to lay secure foundations for the royal finances, culminating in 1237 in the grant of a thirtieth on movables. His position was shaken, however, by the revolt of Richard, earl of Cornwall, in January 1238, and was probably further undermined in the following August, when Henry III tried to persuade the monks of Winchester to elect as bishop another leading counsellor, the queen's uncle William de Valence. On the monks' stating a preference for Raleigh, the king remarked that Raleigh had killed more men with his tongue than Valence had with his sword. In February 1239 Raleigh was elected bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, but he declined; in April he was elected bishop of Norwich, and this time he accepted. As a result he ceased to be a justice, and he retired from the court about Whitsuntide.<br>
<br>On his appointment as bishop Raleigh gave up the lesser church livings he had acquired earlier. The most prestigious was the treasurership of Exeter Cathedral, which he had obtained by 1234; others included Blatherwycke in Northamptonshire, to which he had been presented in 1220, perhaps as a consequence of his association with Pateshull, and Whaplode in Lincolnshire, which he had received in 1231. As bishop of Norwich he punished Jews accused of conspiring to crucify a Christian boy. In 1241 the monks of Winchester still wanted him as their bishop, this time in preference to Boniface of Savoy, another of the queen's uncles and the king's candidate. The king again opposed Raleigh's candidature and urged him to renounce it, but he refused, upon which the king appealed to the pope. In September 1243 Innocent IV confirmed the choice of Raleigh by bull, which the strenuous efforts of the king and the persecution of Raleigh failed to reverse. Unable to obtain possession of his see, Raleigh placed Winchester under interdict and retired to France, where he enjoyed the favour of Louis IX. In 1244 the king had to relent and allow Raleigh to take possession of his bishopric, which was, however, ruined by the costs of the long dispute and by having been in the king's hands for six years.<br>
<br>As bishop of Winchester Raleigh continued to play a wider public role, and in 1244 he was one of the joint committee of bishops, earls, and barons chosen to consider the royal demand for a subsidy. The next year he attended the Council of Lyons. In 1247 the king spent Christmas at Winchester and was reconciled with the bishop. In 1249 Raleigh went abroad again, this time to save money; he died at Tours on 1 September 1250. Matthew Paris wrote a touching account of his end. Earlier he had described him, in his annal for 1236, as a clerk who was the king's familiar, a discreet man and skilled in the laws of the land. One of the most notable of thirteenth-century justices, Raleigh has been plausibly credited with the authorship, or at least the patronage, of the treatise <span class="italic">De legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae</span>, traditionally named <span class="italic">Bracton</span> and formerly ascribed to Henry of Bratton. Bratton probably worked under him in the court <i>coram rege</i> and may have made revisions to an existing text, based on the law as administered by Pateshull and Raleigh, in the years before 1239. The treatise and the compilation known as <span class="italic">Bracton's Notebook</span> provide between them a number of examples of legal innovations by Raleigh through the drafting of new writs, such as the action of cosinage in 1237, and contain many of the cases he heard, some from plea rolls which no longer survive. William of Raleigh had a brother called Robert, probably younger, who on one occasion acted as William's agent in the bench, but who seems to have died young in 1236.<br>
