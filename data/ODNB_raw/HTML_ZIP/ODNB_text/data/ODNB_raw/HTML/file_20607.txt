<span class="headword">Ogle,  Charles Chaloner</span>  (1851&#150;1878), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, fourth son of John Ogle of St Clare, near Ightham, Sevenoaks, Kent, was born on 16 April 1851, and educated, with other pupils, under his father at St Clare. He matriculated at London University in June 1869, and then devoted himself to the study of architecture, becoming a pupil of Frederick William Roper of 9 Adam Street, Adelphi, London. He was a contributor to <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, and in 1872 he both obtained a certificate for excellence in architectural construction and was admitted an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Soon afterwards he visited Rome, and in August 1875 went for some months to Athens, where he worked in the office of Herr Ziller, the royal architect. While he was thus engaged, <span class="italic">The Times</span> accepted his offer to be their special correspondent in the 1878 war between Turkey and Montenegro and the insurgent Balkan provinces, and he accompanied the Turkish force against the Montenegrins. Ogle's reports from Montenegro and Herzegovina, from Greece, from Crete, and from Thessaly were full of picturesque details, with a kindly humour. While residing at Volo, on the Gulf of Thessaly, Ogle learned on 28 March 1878 that an engagement was imminent between the Turkish troops and the insurgents occupying Mount Pelion and the town of Macrynitza. He at once went unarmed to the scene of action. The battle took place and was prolonged to the following day; Ogle, unable to obtain a horse to return to Volo, slept at Katochori on 29 and 30 March. On 1 April his headless body was found lying in a ravine, and was identified by a scar on the wrist and a bloodstained telegram in his pocket book addressed to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. The body was taken on board HMS <i>Wizard</i>, and conveyed to Piraeus, Athens, where it was accorded a public funeral on 10 April. It was believed that Ogle's murder was an act of revenge ordered by Amouss Aga, the Turkish commander, because Ogle had criticized him for pillaging a village. To disguise the murder, a report was circulated that Ogle was aiding the insurgents. In a parliamentary paper issued on 18 June, Ogle was blamed for imprudence in venturing among the belligerents without necessity, and his death was attributed to a wound received while retreating with the insurgents after the second battle of Macrynitza; the correctness of these statements was strenuously denied by his friends.<br>
