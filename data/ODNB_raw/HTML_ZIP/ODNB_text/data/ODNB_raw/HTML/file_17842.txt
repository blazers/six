<span class="headword">Majendie,  Henry William</span>  (1754&#150;1830), <span class="occ">bishop of Bangor</span>, was born in London on 7 October 1754, the elder son of John James Majendie (1709&#150;1782) and his wife, Elizabeth Prevost (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1818). Majendie's grandfather Andr&eacute; left France in 1688 and settled in England in 1700. He ministered to the French congregation in Exeter and married Susanna Mauzy, the daughter of the French pastor at Barnstaple, Devon. John James Majendie, after serving as pastor of the French church of the Savoy, was ordained in the Church of England. Soon after her arrival in England in 1761, he became preceptor to Queen Charlotte, living at court until 1769. He taught her English and she remained a patron and friend. Appointed a canon of Windsor in 1774, he became the queen's domestic chaplain and a tutor to her two sons, the prince of Wales and the duke of York.<br>
<br>Majendie was educated at Charterhouse School, under Dr Samuel Berdmore, and from 1771 at Christ's College, Cambridge. He secured a scholarship there in 1772, and graduated BA in 1776, proceeding MA in 1785 and DD in 1791. In 1776 he was elected to the fellowship at Christ's just vacated by William Paley. He was ordained priest in 1783 at Worcester, and served as vicar of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, from 1783 to 1785. In January 1780 he was appointed preceptor to Prince William (the future William IV) at a salary of &pound;200 a year, but had acted as one of his instructors since June 1776. In a letter to the king of 1 November 1782 Prince William noted that Majendie &#145;has been between 7 and 8 years with me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 5.694, no. 4294). As the king told Pitt in a letter of 13 September 1797, Majendie &#145;attended him with unremitting attention for four years on board the Fleet&#146;  (ibid., 2.622, no. 1617) during the American War of Independence. On the <i>Prince George</i> they travelled much of the world, including a visit to New York in November 1782. It was as a direct reward for this service that Majendie was appointed a canon of Windsor in 1785 and he deferred marriage until he received that appointment. On 11 April 1785 he married Anne Routledge (<i>d</i>. 1836) of Stapleton, Cumberland; they had thirteen children. He was vicar of Nether Stowey in Somerset, where he earned the friendship of Thomas Poole (the correspondent of Coleridge), from 1790 to 1793, and vicar of Hungerford from 1793 to 1798. In that year he resigned his Windsor canonry for a residential prebend at St Paul's, and the vicarage of Hungerford for that of New Windsor. He retained both prebend and living when he became bishop of Chester in 1800, but resigned both in 1809 when he was translated to the bishopric of Bangor. He remained in this see for twenty-one years, until his death on 9 July 1830 at the house of his son the Revd Stuart Majendie, at Longdon, near Lichfield.<br>
<br>A strong supporter of the established order at the time of the French Revolution, Majendie regarded Pitt the younger as &#145;the ablest Man who ever guided the Councils of this Nation&#146;  (H. W. Majendie, <span class="italic">A Charge Delivered to the Clergy of the Diocese of Bangor &hellip; 1814</span>, 15). He understood the need to educate the poor as a means of achieving social control and founded a Sunday school at Nether Stowey. Later he was a vigorous supporter of the National Society, advocating the establishment of parochial and daily schools. He strongly supported legislation relating to the residence of clergy and the appointment of stipendary curates. He was aware of the growth of industrial occupations in the diocese of Chester, appreciated the problems of clergy &#145;in populous and commercial districts&#146;, stressed the need for them to co-operate with the schoolmaster and the civil magistrate, and encouraged them to serve as magistrates themselves  (H. W. Majendie, <span class="italic">A Charge Delivered &hellip; Chester</span>, 19). As well as appearing regularly in the House of Lords, he took his pastoral responsibilities seriously and gave his clergy practical advice. He showed a pragmatic awareness of the necessary attitude of clergy to rich and poor; in 1804 he warned his clergy not to attempt &#145;private religious discourse in an obtrusive, laboured, or authoritative manner [with] the higher orders of society, whose fastidious refinement&#146; might make it counter-productive, but to save it for &#145;the poor and unlearned [who] will more readily listen to instruction from their Minister, because they think it very natural and becoming his office whether in the church, the house or the field&#146;  (ibid., 30). As a bishop he used his influence to appoint his sons and other relations to lucrative livings, and contemporaries commented on &#145;the corpulence of the bishop's person and the imperturbable gravity of his countenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cheshire Sheaf</span>, 86).<br>
