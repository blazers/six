<span class="headword">Bligh,  Ivo Francis Walter</span>, eighth earl of Darnley  (1859&#150;1927), <span class="occ">cricketer and bequeather of the &#145;Ashes&#146;</span>, born on 13 March 1859 at Bruton Street, London, was the second son of John Stuart Bligh, the sixth earl (1827&#150;1896), who owned estates in Kent and co. Meath, and his wife, Lady Harriet Mary Pelham (1829&#150;1905), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21791/', "Henry Thomas Pelham, the third earl of Chichester")</script>. He was educated at Cheam preparatory school and Eton College, where he was in the eleven (1876&#150;7). He was in residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1877 to 1881 (BA 1882), and represented the university at racquets and tennis as well as winning four cricket blues (1878&#150;81). In 1881, however, his health broke down and despite being captain, he made only three appearances. His best year proved to be 1880, when he appeared for the Gentlemen against the Players and scored 1013 runs (average 30.69).<br>
<br>Bligh is indelibly associated with the origin of the &#145;Ashes&#146; in 1882. Australia's victory over England led to an &#145;obituary&#146; in the <span class="italic">Sporting Times</span> &#145;in affectionate remembrance of English cricket which died at the Oval on 29 August 1882 &hellip; the body will be cremated and the Ashes taken to Australia&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Times</span>, 2 Sept 1882). Bligh &#145;thought it would be very good fun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cricket Field</span>, 30 June 1894, 233) to take a side to Australia and by September his party was at sea. The passengers included Florence Rose Morphy (<i>d</i>. 1944), companion to the wife of Sir William Clarke, Australia's first baronet and president of Melbourne Cricket Club. Bligh returned to Australia in 1884 and married Florence on 10 February that year. Their first married home was in Melbourne, where (in 1886) the future ninth earl was born. They would have another son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In welcoming the tourists at Melbourne, W. L. Murdoch hoped they would not take home &#145;those revered ashes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Melbourne Herald</span>, 28 Nov 1882). But, at the end of three matches, the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span> (31 January 1883) reported they were in Mr Bligh's &#145;custody&#146; though <span class="italic">Wisden</span> (1884) made no such reference. Nevertheless, the mythical &#145;Ashes&#146; became a reality. At a &#145;social&#146; match on Christmas eve 1882, at the Clarkes' home at Rupertswood, near Melbourne, Lady Clarke had a bail burnt and put in an urn as a personal gift to Bligh. He told the story in the <span class="italic">Cricket Field</span> in 1894 and bequeathed the urn to Lord's on his death. At a reception for the 1930 Australian tourists in London, the dowager Countess Darnley recounted the events at Rupertswood in detail  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 June 1930).<br>
<br>While the &#145;Ashes&#146; would be a lodestar for Anglo-Australian cricket in the future, Bligh's own star was only briefly in the ascendant and after the tour of Australia he played very little. Expectations of him had always been greater than fulfilment, yet <span class="italic">Cricket</span> could write &#145;it would be difficult to name any English sportsman of any kind more deservedly popular &hellip; a very dangerous batsman if allowed to get set&#146;  (16 March 1883). But ill health continued to prevail and he began &#145;to despair of ever getting well&#146; until taking up golf in 1889  (<span class="italic">Cricket Field</span>, 30 June 1894, 233).<br>
<br>Bligh was president of Kent County Cricket Club (1892 and 1902) and of the MCC in the year he inherited the earldom from his elder brother (1900). In 1905 he was elected a representative peer for Ireland and he was a deputy lieutenant and alderman for Kent. He died in his sleep at his home, Puckle Hill, Cobham, near Gravesend, Kent, on 10 April 1927 and was buried four days later in Cobham churchyard. Florence Darnley, who was made a DBE (1919) for her work for the arts, died on 30 August 1944.<br>
