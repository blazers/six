<span class="headword">Syme,  John</span>  (1872&#150;1945), <span class="occ">police officer and campaigner</span>, was born at the High Street, Irvine, Ayrshire, on 15 January 1872, the eldest son in the family of at least four sons and two daughters of Thomas Dewes Syme (1841&#150;1914), grocer, and his wife, Mary Miller, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Curzen (1842&#150;1909). After working as a law clerk at Cadder, Lanarkshire, where his father had become manager of a brickworks, Syme moved to London and joined the Metropolitan Police on 8 October 1894. Intelligent and competent, he received rapid promotion to sergeant in less than five years. On 24 March 1900 he married, at Belgrave Presbyterian Church, Ellen Mary (1869&#150;1948), daughter of Edward Burch, master picture frame maker; they had one son. He was promoted station sergeant in 1901 and inspector in February 1908.<br>
<br>In 1909 occurred the incident that led ultimately to Syme's dismissal and the acute sense of grievance that lasted for the rest of his life. As duty inspector at Gerald Road police station on 17 August 1909 he refused a charge made by two constables. Summoned by neighbours to a noisy late-night street altercation in Pimlico, where two men in liquor were being refused admission by a householder, the two officers had arrested the men to bring the situation under control. It transpired, however, that unknown to the officers, one of the arrested men was in fact the husband of the woman who had barred the door and the other was their lodger. Syme therefore refused the charge. His two superior officers, Acting Superintendent Shervington and Subdivisional Inspector Reed, sought to discipline the constables and, during the proceedings, Syme intervened on the constables' behalf in a way his superiors found objectionable. The superintendent recommended to his chief constable that Syme be transferred to another police division on the grounds that he was too familiar with the men. Transfer to North Fulham was approved by the assistant commissioner not on the grounds of overfamiliarity but to relieve the evident tension at Gerald Road.<br>
<br>Two months later, and as a way of challenging what was otherwise a discretionary, unappealable management decision, Syme made serious allegations about the competence and honesty of his two Gerald Road superiors. Failing in the opinion of an inquiry to substantiate his allegations, Syme was reprimanded and demoted to station sergeant. When his appeal (after inquiries about his state of mental health) was turned down by the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir Edward Henry, in a thorough and carefully worded adjudication, Syme claimed the decision was unjust and he would contest it publicly by appealing to parliament. After clearing his lines with the Home Office, where the home secretary, Herbert Gladstone, noted that police discipline could not be left to MPs, Henry dismissed Syme on 31 January 1910 with consequent loss of pension rights. However, Gladstone was succeeded on 19 February 1910 by Winston Churchill, who was not satisfied with the way in which the case had been handled, and gave a personal interview to Syme on 22 April 1910 during which he offered to reinstate Syme at his reduced rank provided he discontinued his public agitation.<br>
<br>Syme refused and continued to campaign. He composed and printed pamphlets, wrote to MPs, peers, and the press, sent threatening letters to the king and others, held public meetings of the John Syme Defence League in Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park, Peckham Rye, and towns in Wales and Scotland, and in 1913 set up a policemen's union (with the motto &#145;Tyranny is not discipline&#146;), which officers were forbidden by Henry&#151;on pain of dismissal&#151;to join. His first conviction was on 14 July 1910 when he was bound over for threatening to attack the king in a letter to the prime minister. In addition Syme was convicted on 4 July 1911 of threatening to kill Reed (in a letter to the leader of the Labour Party, Ramsay MacDonald) and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, upheld on appeal.<br>
<br>Initially Syme enjoyed the support of John Kempster, editor of the <span class="italic">Police Review</span>. That support waned in the face of the successful libel action Shervington and Reed brought against the <span class="italic">Review</span> in 1911, and Kempster effectively dissociated himself from Syme in November 1913. Similarly Syme's colleagues tired of his use of the union to harp on his own case. In what became the National Union of Police and Prison Officers, they got rid of him well before the strikes of 1918 and 1919. The lack of police enthusiasm for Syme's actions was reflected both in the apparently meagre totals of collections made on his behalf and the fact that, as later claimed by the Police Federation, the number of paid-up union members in his time never exceeded forty-seven.<br>
<br>The authorities were baffled in their attempts to close Syme down. Patient official explanations and even the unprecedented publication in 1911 of Henry's adjudication were to no avail. At a time of marked class conflict and labour unrest before the First World War, Syme attracted sympathy, particularly when his account of events stressed that he had been victimized because he had sought to stand up for the underdog. No one had experience of dealing with an intelligent, persistent, and resourceful opponent able to take advantage of a greatly expanded popular press and a general sympathy towards attempts to ameliorate the lot of working men. Syme's powerful trope of victimhood could be endlessly resuscitated for a succession of sympathizers&#151;some to grind their own axes&#151;even if some of those who supported him cooled as a result of the experience.<br>
<br>None of this deterred Syme, who seems to have enjoyed and become dependent on the attention he provoked and whose life became centred on his cause. A procedure evolved where, when magistrates moved to bind him over to keep the peace, he would refuse to accept the conditions and, therefore, underwent short periods of imprisonment instead. Syme would refuse all food in prison and, because he was judged by medical staff not to be fit for force-feeding, he would be released temporarily under the <span class="roman">Prisoners' (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act</span> of 1913, an act devised to deal with suffragette food refusal. In this way he would gradually work off the sentence, the remainder of which in the longer cases was sometimes remitted by home secretaries.<br>
<br>There were two public reviews of his claims. The first arose from his prosecution for criminal libel in 1914 as a result of his wilder allegations against Henry. Reluctant at first to proceed against him, the authorities decided that Syme's language had become so extreme and offensive that it was subversive of discipline. Following a six-day trial in which Syme represented himself and during which the trial judge gave him every latitude (including more than one day of court time to sum up his defence) as he sought constantly to return to the merits of his grievances, Syme was convicted and sentenced to eight months' imprisonment on 16 July 1914.<br>
<br>The second review was a judicial inquiry instituted by the minority Labour government in 1924. The prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, had taken up Syme's case and an inquiry was seen as offering the best means of closure one way or the other. In July 1924, after hearings over five days, the inquiry panel of two judges and a leading KC found comprehensively against Syme, who, having originally agreed to be bound by the findings, rejected them on the grounds that the proceedings had been biased against him.<br>
<br>To the fury of the Metropolitan Police commissioner, William Horwood, who thought him certifiable, Syme recommenced his agitation, continuing to make wild allegations in order to get attention. Although the Home Office realized that Syme was engaging in a species of blackmail, Horwood had been firmly told in 1923 that there could be no question of permitting Syme to starve himself to death in prison unless he was convicted of a very serious offence, and the cabinet agreed.<br>
<br>However, shortly after reception at Pentonville to serve another Bow Street sentence, Syme was certified on 28 November 1924 and sent to Broadmoor. While there, the home secretary (Joynson Hicks) wrote to Syme &#145;man to man&#146; urging him to desist and explaining among other things that the act of 1913 did not apply to Broadmoor and that hunger striking was therefore best avoided. While Syme threatened to go on hunger strike in Broadmoor, he did not do so. Representing his transfer as punitive, Labour Party supporters rallied to Syme and the John Syme Lunacy Appeal Committee was permitted to send independent psychiatrists to examine him only to opine that he was properly detained on the grounds that he was suffering from paranoia of a &#145;querulent type&#146;.<br>
<br>Following release on 24 May 1925 Syme continued to plead his cause to anyone who would listen, and recommenced what became a saga of vague threats and attempted or actual minor attacks on public property (stones thrown at windows), particularly but not only the Home Office. Throughout he was kept under the eye of special branch in case he elected to do real harm, and the archives contain the meticulous reports of successive officers who, as relations were always cordial, were perhaps as close to Syme and his family as anyone.<br>
<br>During the minority Labour government of 1929&#150;31 a group of government MPs sought to arrange a financial settlement in response to the fact that Syme was virtually destitute. By means of a wholly extra-statutory arrangement Syme was treated as if he had been retired on medical grounds in 1910. J. R. Clynes, the home secretary, approached all the party leaders and his predecessors for their agreement. With the sole exception of Churchill, all agreed and Syme received a lump sum of &pound;1233 and an annual pension of &pound;72 12<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Despite signing an undertaking that he would accept the award without subsequent &#145;interpretation&#146;, Syme none the less then attacked the government on the grounds that the award was illegal and tried to persuade the comptroller and auditor-general to find against the government accordingly.<br>
<br>Syme's last conviction was on 5 March 1941 for breaking a window in Grindlay's Bank in Whitehall. Refusing to pay the fine, he served twenty-eight days' imprisonment, which included nine periods of release in accordance with the act of 1913. He died at the London Homeopathic Hospital, Great Ormond Street, on 9 February 1945. His pension died with him but, as the result of a request from his son, Ronald, Home Office officials found a source for two <i>ex gratia</i> payments of &pound;100 for Mrs Syme, who died in September 1948. The last official word on her and, by implication, her husband may be taken from the report of the special branch sergeant who had spent much time in contact with them. Commenting on her condition after Syme's death he judged that &#145;although she may not have believed in his long campaign against authority, she never let him down&#146;  (11 April 1945, TNA: PRO, HO 45/24596/1193).<br>
<br>While Syme's challenge to the legitimacy of unmediated managerial authority can be seen as one of the early milestones on the way to the form of police unionism finally endorsed by parliament, for Syme the real issue was always personal rather than collective.<br>
