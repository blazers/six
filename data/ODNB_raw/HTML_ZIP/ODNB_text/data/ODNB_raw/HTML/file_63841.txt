<span class="headword">Valentine,  Charles Wilfrid</span>  (1879&#150;1964), <span class="occ">psychologist and educationist</span>, was born on 16 August 1879 at Halton Road, Runcorn, Cheshire, one of the eight children of Henry Valentine (<i>b</i>. 1841), a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Sophia Woodcock. He attended Nottingham high school and then Preston grammar school, leaving at seventeen to teach in a small boarding-school. Nevertheless, after seven years of teaching at various secondary schools, interspersed with largely self-financed degree studies, Valentine's university education was eventually both thorough and extensive. He obtained a BA from London University (taken externally at University College, Aberystwyth, where he was an exhibitioner), an MA from Cambridge gained with a double first in philosophy and psychology in 1909 (as a foundation scholar in moral sciences at Downing College), and a DPhil from St Andrews in 1913. He also spent part of 1908 as a student at the W&uuml;rzburg laboratory of Oswald K&uuml;lpe in Germany, where he steeped himself in the new experimental investigation of what were then termed the higher mental functions, including imagery and thinking. What seemed particularly to impress Valentine and also Cyril Burt, a fellow student at W&uuml;rzburg who became a lifelong friend, was the work on human learning, memory, and experimental pedagogy, especially that by Ernst Meumann.<br>
<br>On returning from Germany, Valentine obtained his first academic post at twenty-nine and spent the next five years until 1914 as lecturer in psychology to St Andrews provincial committee, working also as assistant in education at the University of St Andrews for four of them. During his tenure at St Andrews he married, on 4 January 1911, (Margaret) Ethel Rothwell Jackson (1887/8&#150;1956), daughter of Arthur Jackson, retired mechanical engineer; there were three sons and a daughter from this union. After a further five years as professor of education at Queen's University, Belfast, he became professor of education at the University of Birmingham in 1919, a post he held until his retirement in 1946.<br>
<br>In Birmingham, Valentine's considerable talents as teacher, writer, and researcher flourished as he established what was in effect the first major centre for educational psychology in the UK. His broad and eclectic education, together with his wide teaching experience, helped him to command the shifting borderland between psychology and education, where formidable psychological, statistical, and also social skills were vital. Over this long period his research into such topics as child development, transfer of training, imagery, mental testing, home and classroom discipline, the reliability of examinations, and the questionable place of Latin in the curriculum gave rise to more than fifty papers and sixteen books (most of which went into several editions). The most influential of these were <span class="italic">Psychology and its Bearing on Education</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Intelligence Tests for Children</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">The Difficult Child and the Problems of Discipline</span> (1940). Like Sully, Binet, and Piaget before him he made his systematic observation of his own children's development the basis of one of his major works: <span class="italic">The Psychology of Early Childhood</span> (1942).<br>
<br>Valentine probably also found his other academic love, the psychology of aesthetics, as early as 1908 in W&uuml;rzburg; Burt claims that they were both surprised by K&uuml;lpe's strong interest in the subject. In any event Valentine's earliest published book, <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Experimental Psychology of Beauty</span> (1913), was on what he termed his &#145;hobby&#146;. This apparently minor interest continued to fascinate him. His last published work on the subject, <span class="italic">The Experimental Psychology of Beauty</span>, appeared in 1962, only two years before his death. An interest in aspects of Freudian thinking, in particular in the psychology of dreams and the light that they cast on the unconscious, occupied him for many years, culminating in the publication of <span class="italic">Dreams and the Unconscious</span> (1921). A revised edition appeared in 1928 under the title <span class="italic">The New Psychology of the Unconscious</span>. He also enthusiastically embraced the problems of military education in the Second World War, even to the extent of enduring the rigours of army basic training though nearing retirement age. The outcome of this work appeared in the two short but typically practical and down-to-earth books, <span class="italic">Principles of Army Instruction</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">The Human Factor in the Army</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Among Valentine's other major contributions to British academic life was his role as founder and editor for nearly ten years of <span class="italic">The Forum of Education</span>, and then of its successor, the <span class="italic">British Journal of Educational Psychology</span>, which he edited and managed for a further unprecedented twenty-five years from its creation in 1931. During his tenure the <span class="italic">Journal</span> was committed to championing the contribution that a distinctively British psychology had made to education. He was also associated with various societies that supported psychology; he was president of Section J (psychology) of the British Association of Science in 1930 and president of the British Psychological Society for 1947&#150;8. Earlier he had also served with considerable success on local bodies, for example as chairman of the Birmingham higher education subcommittee from 1919 to 1925, a considerable coup for someone barely settled into his major academic position. Still writing to within a few months of the end, Valentine died at his home, the White House, 92 Silver Street, Wythall, Worcestershire, on 26 May 1964.<br>
