<span class="headword">Cornwall,  Peter  of</span>  (1139/40&#150;1221), <span class="occ">scholar and prior of Holy Trinity, Aldgate</span>, was born on his father's estates in or near Launceston, Cornwall, the son of Jordan of Trecarrel (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1180), sometime <i>praepositus</i> (or provost) of Launceston. In his <span class="italic">Liber revelationum</span>, book 1, chapter 6, he gives some account of his father's character, and he relates stories concerning his grandfather Ailsi and his uncles, Jordan's brothers, of whom the two eldest, Bernard and Nicholas, were <i>scriptores</i> in the royal chapel in the time of Henry I. Peter also mentions his kinship by marriage to Reginald de Dunstanville, earl of Cornwall; whence it has been conjectured that Peter's mother was a sister of the earl's wife, Beatrice, daughter of William fitz Richard of Cardinan, the most important of the local nobility.<br>
<br>Little is known of Peter's early career. He studied in London where his teacher was Master Henry of Northampton, a canon of St Paul's, who was often in residence during the 1170s and 1180s. Godfrey de Lucy, later bishop of Winchester, is once referred to as his fellow student. After 1170 he was received as an Augustinian canon by Prior Stephen at Holy Trinity, Aldgate&#151;the mother house from which the priory in his home town of Launceston had been founded. In Stephen's company he attended a synod in London, where a sermon preached by Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London, provided the inspiration for Peter's first work of scholarship, the massive <span class="italic">Pantheologus</span>, completed in 1189. In this book he presented a great quantity of biblical material organized by subject as an aid for preachers, using the method of treating a scriptural theme <i>per distinctiones</i>&#151;that is, presenting interpretations of words schematically, according to the various senses in which they could be interpreted. Of the extant copies, there is one complete set in a contemporary hand, BL, Royal MSS 7 E.viii, 7 C.xiii, 7 C.xiv; this belonged to the library of Rochester Cathedral priory and may have been a presentation copy from Peter to his friend Gilbert de Glanville, bishop of Rochester.<br>
<br>In 1197 Peter succeeded Stephen as prior of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, one of the three major religious houses in London. He continued in office until his death on 7 July 1221, and was buried at the priory. He was a conscientious administrator and was remembered as a great teacher. In 1210 Peter and his friend Benedict, abbot of Stratford Langthorn, acted as intermediaries between King John and Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, unsuccessfully seeking a reconciliation and an end to the interdict.<br>
<br>Peter of Cornwall is now remembered principally for his scholarship, which was of a compilatory rather than an original nature. His <span class="italic">De reparatione lapsus generis humani</span> (Som. ARS, MS DD/AH 66/17) is dedicated to Gilbert de Glanville. This work is referred to in the <span class="italic">Liber disputationum contra Symonem Iudeum</span> (Eton College, MS 130, fols. 92&#150;226<i>v</i>), which Peter dedicated to Stephen Langton in exile during the interdict (1208&#150;11). The biblical compilation intended to introduce the latter work does not survive. Peter's personal manuscript of his <span class="italic">Liber revelationum</span> (LPL, MS 51) is an immense collection of visions relating to the next life, compiled between 1200 (in which year he was aged sixty) and 1206. It is largely derivative, but it contains some stories written from his own experience and that of his personal acquaintances, including an account of his family and its devotion to St Stephen's Church, Launceston. These personal stories, together with the prefaces to his theological compilations, provide the principal evidence for his career.<br>
