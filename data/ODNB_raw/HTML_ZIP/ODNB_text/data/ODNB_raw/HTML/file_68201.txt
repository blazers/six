<span class="headword">Cynwal,  Wiliam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1587/8), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, the eldest son of John ap Dafydd ap Hywel and his wife, Lowri, daughter of John ap Robert Palcws. He lived at Ysbyty Ifan, Denbighshire, where he combined farming with his profession as a bard; his home in 1567 was Cerrigellgwm. Cynwal married Margred, daughter of Robert Wyn; they had four daughters. Cynwal also had an illegitimate son, Thomas. He was a disciple of Gruffudd Hiraethog, the foremost Welsh bardic teacher of the day; like other of Hiraethog's disciples he inherited some of his manuscripts. Cynwal was awarded the second-highest bardic degree of <i>disgybl pencerddaidd</i> at the Caerwys eisteddfod of 1567; his claim that he was later awarded the premier degree of <i>pencerdd</i> at a nuptial feast accords with known bardic practice. Cynwal's earliest extant work&#151;an example of the short <i>englyn</i> metre&#151;is dated to 1561, but a <i>cywydd</i> composed in 1564, described by him as his first ever, marks the beginning of his bardic career proper.<br>
<br>Cynwal's manuscripts&#151;containing not only his own poems, but also genealogical and heraldic matter, a bardic grammar, and bruts&#151;display his familiarity with the main branches of bardic learning; like his teacher, Gruffudd Hiraethog, he possessed particular expertise in genealogy. In addition to over 230 longer poems (<i>cywyddau</i> and <i>awdlau</i>), some 500 of his <i>englynion</i> are extant, many of them combined in lengthy sequences. (Manuscripts containing copies of his poems are held by the National Library of Wales, University of Wales, Bangor, Cardiff Central Library, the British Library, and Christ Church, Oxford.) Cynwal was a competent but intensely traditional poet whose work testifies to the stagnation prevalent in contemporary bardism. The bulk of his output consisted of eulogies and elegies addressed almost exclusively to gentry and clergy in north Wales; he also composed request poems, amatory verse, and poems on religious and moral subjects (many of his <i>englynion</i> being in this vein). Among his more interesting poems were two composed in defence of women in response to attacks on the fair sex by other poets; one of these is in the &#145;free&#146; (accentual) metres, one of only two poems in these metres by Cynwal.<br>
<br>Cynwal is chiefly renowned as the adversary of Edmwnd Prys, archdeacon of Merioneth, in the longest bardic debate (<i>ymryson</i>) extant in Welsh. The debate, dated <i>c</i>.1581&#150;7, amounted to fifty-four <i>cywyddau</i>, of which Cynwal contributed nineteen [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48659/', "Cywyddwyr (act. c.1330&#150;c.1650)")</script>]. It started with a poem by Prys requesting the gift of a bow from Cynwal for a mutual acquaintance, but the Cambridge-educated archdeacon soon digressed to canvass more important matters. He castigated poets like Cynwal for their mendacious praise poems and for peddling false pedigrees, urging them to displace eulogy with divine poems based on scripture and learned poems based on the arts and sciences. Cynwal's rather limited response to this humanist critique illustrates his conservatism: he deplored Prys's resort to satire, urged him to confine himself to divine matters, decried his lack of a bardic teacher and formal bardic qualifications, and charged him with ignorance of bardic etiquette.<br>
<br>The debate was ended by Cynwal's death, Prys concluding it by diplomatically composing an elegy praising his adversary's bardic learning. Cynwal's will, dated 22 November 1587, was proved on 16 January 1588. He was buried at the parish church of Ysbyty Ifan.<br>
