</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  William</span>  (1819&#150;1890), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, born at Whitehaven on 11 February 1819, was the eldest son of John Thompson of Kelswick House, near that town. Both his parents were of Scottish extraction. His mother, Isabella, was maternally descended from Patrick Home of Polwarth, and was related to the earls of Marchmont. His father migrated to Whitehaven in 1813 to join the business of his uncle, Walter Thompson. John Thompson became director of the local bank and chairman of the Cleator Moor Hematite Iron Company, the first hematite company formed in the north of England. He died at Bishopthorpe Palace on 18 April 1878, aged eighty-seven  (<span class="italic">West Cumberland and Whitehaven Herald</span>, 25 April and 2 May 1878).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>William was educated at Shrewsbury School, entering at the age of eleven. During his schooldays he preferred science to classics, although at Shrewsbury he had no opportunity of following his bent. On 2 June 1836 he matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford. He was elected a scholar in the following year and a fellow in 1840. He graduated BA in that year and MA in 1844.<br>
<br>While an undergraduate, Thompson devoted himself chiefly to the study of logic, somewhat to the detriment of his work for the schools, and before he graduated he had practically completed a treatise entitled &#145;Outlines of the laws of thought&#146;. This was published in 1842, and brought him his earliest reputation. The germ of his work, he states, he derived from Christian von Wolff's <span class="italic">Philosophia rationalis</span> and Daniel Albert Wyttenbach's <span class="italic">Praecepta philosophiae logicae</span>. Thompson's treatment of his topic was remarkably clear, and he arranged his matter with great skill. The merits of the treatise brought him into communication with many authorities on the subject, including Sir William Hamilton, Professor De Morgan, James McCosh, Philip Henry, Lord Mahon (later fifth Earl Stanhope), and William Whewell. From these, and especially from Sir William Hamilton, Thompson received many suggestions which induced him to make considerable alterations in the later editions of his work. Thompson's &#145;Outlines&#146; in some respects anticipated John Stuart Mill's <span class="italic">System of Logic</span>, and was long used extensively as a textbook.<br>
<br>Soon after the publication of his treatise in 1842, Thompson was ordained deacon, and left Oxford to devote himself to clerical work. He took priest's orders in 1843, and in the next four years served curacies, first at St Nicholas, Guildford, Surrey (1844&#150;6), and afterwards at Cuddesdon, near Oxford, under the nominal vicar, Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford. About this time he dropped the &#145;p&#146; from his name, thinking &#145;Thomson&#146; less plebeian; he was mocked for this for the rest of his life, especially at Queen's.<br>
<br>Thomson's growing reputation as a logician led Queen's College in 1847 to recall him to Oxford to act as college tutor. In this capacity he did much to retrieve the standing of the college. Indefatigable in his attention to its affairs, he filled the office not merely of tutor, but also of chaplain and dean. In 1852 he became junior bursar, and in 1854 bursar. At the same time he was recognized in the university as a preacher of power. In 1848 he was appointed select preacher, and in 1853 he was chosen Bampton lecturer. Taking as his subject the atoning work of Christ, he dwelt on the expiatory character of the atonement, and his sermons constitute a very complete exposition of that theory of the purpose of Christ's incarnation. They attracted great attention, and St Mary's was more crowded than it had been since the time of Newman  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 June 1853).<h2>
<a name="Universityandcollegereform"></a>University and college reform</h2>In the matter of academic organization Thomson was strongly in favour of reform. He disapproved of the principles on which college fellowships were filled. At that period they were nearly all confined to persons born in particular districts, and at Queen's College, contrary to the statutes, elections were restricted to natives of Cumberland and Westmorland. In conjunction with another fellow, George Henry Sacheverell Johnson, Thomson endeavoured to remedy this state of things. In 1849 the fellows rejected the candidature of Goldwin Smith, afterwards regius professor of modern history, and elected instead a native of Cumberland whom they had previously removed from the list of expectants on account of his insufficient attainments. Thomson appealed against this action to Lord John Russell, the prime minister; as a result of this and other representations a royal commission was appointed in 1850 to inquire into the constitution and revenues of the university, and in 1854 a second commission was empowered to revise the statutes of the university and of the colleges and halls. The proposed innovations alarmed the more conservative members of the university, and several attacks on the commissions appeared. In reply to one of these, entitled <span class="italic">The Case of Queen's College</span> (1854), by the Revd John Barrow, Thomson penned <span class="italic">An Open College Best for All</span> (1854). This pamphlet was generally considered the ablest contribution to the reformers' side of the controversy, and was much quoted in the parliamentary debates.<h2>
<a name="MarriageandprovostofQueens"></a>Marriage and provost of Queen's</h2>In 1855 Thomson married Zo&euml;, daughter of James Henry Skene, British consul at Aleppo, and his wife, Rhalon Rizo-Rangabe, a Greek beauty of aristocratic descent. With her he had five daughters and four sons, including the &#145;spycatcher&#146; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36499/', "Sir Basil Home Thomson")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36504/', "Jocelyn Home Thomson")</script>. As a result of his marriage, Thomson lost his fellowship; he was presented by the crown to the rectory of All Souls, Marylebone. Within a few months, however, on the death of the Revd John Fox, on 11 August, he was elected provost of Queen's College and resigned his living. As provost he steadily pursued his liberalizing policy. He advocated the enlargement of the curriculum of university studies, and, with a view to aiding scientific study, was one of the projectors of the university museum, which was afterwards erected in the university parks. Outside Oxford he accepted preferment, whereby he extended his reputation as a preacher who appealed to the intellect rather than to the emotions of his audience. In 1858 he was elected to the preachership of Lincoln's Inn, and in 1859 he was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen.<br>
<br>Thomson's theological position was conspicuously defined during the controversy that followed the publication in 1860 of <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>. In his ardour for reform at Oxford he had associated himself with Benjamin Jowett and the newer school of broad-churchmen, and in 1855 he had contributed a paper, &#145;Crime and its excuses&#146;, to <span class="italic">Oxford Essays</span>. He was to have been one of the contributors to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>, but failed to get his paper to the printer in time (happily for him, in view of the events of the next two years). However, when <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> was published, in 1860, Thomson led the orthodox campaign against it, editing in reply <span class="italic">Aids to Faith</span> (1861). This volume included contributions from Edward Harold Browne, Frederick Charles Cook, Charles John Ellicott, and Henry Longueville Mansel, besides an article of his own, &#145;The death of Christ&#146;, which was substantially a restatement of his Bampton lectures in more popular form. <span class="italic">Aids to Faith</span> was the most substantial general answer to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>, and possesses historical value as a clear statement of the orthodox position at that period. Almost at the same time Thomson was engaged, as one of a committee of ten, in preparing the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span>, to which he contributed an &#145;Introduction to the synoptical gospels&#146;, probably the best treatise on the subject then extant.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofYork"></a>Archbishop of York</h2>In the same year (1861), on the translation of C. T. Baring to the see of Durham, Thomson, whose established fame as a preacher marked him out for promotion, was appointed Baring's successor in the see of Gloucester and Bristol. Within ten months of his consecration, however, Charles Thomas Longley, the archbishop of York, was translated to Canterbury, and, though so junior a bishop, Thomson was appointed Longley's successor, A. C. Tait having declined. This rapid advancement, coupled with public knowledge of his ambivalent role in the <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> affair, excited envy and distrust among his clerical colleagues. He was enthroned at York Minster on 25 February 1863, and entered on an archiepiscopate which extended over twenty-eight years. The new archbishop was a very tall man (and wore a size eight hat). He was imposing in full episcopal dress, with long, bushy hair and side-whiskers. He and his wife were known as a handsome couple. He was vain about his appearance and had a reputation for vulgarity. He signed a hotel register: &#145;His Grace, the Lord Archbishop of York&#146;. None the less Thomson performed the various duties of his office with success. From the commencement of his archiepiscopate he realized that, to keep its place in English life, the English church must show itself able to meet modern needs. He was active in his support of diocesan conferences and church congresses, and showed a keen interest in social, economic, and political questions, together with a just discernment of their relation to ecclesiastical matters. He made his first public appearance as archbishop at a meeting of the Castle Howard Reformatory in 1863, and from that time onwards he was present at every large public meeting in the diocese, whether its object was the amendment of the criminal law, the amelioration of the state of the poor, the encouragement of education, or the cultivation of art or science.<br>
<br>In 1862 the increase of population in the north of England had surpassed the resources of the church, and in the large towns the numbers of the clergy were quite inadequate for the needs of the people. Sheffield, for example, had only one church for 8000 inhabitants, and that town, like all its neighbours, was a centre of anti-clerical feeling. Thomson from the first set himself to meet these difficulties. In 1865, at the church congress at York, he suggested the addition of a working men's meeting to the ordinary programme. In 1869 he gained the attention of the workers of Sheffield, who had hitherto treated the clergy with scorn, by a speech defending the English church from the charge that it was a useless institution maintained at an undue cost to the nation. This speech was followed by others of like tenor. The population of Sheffield at once acknowledged the force of his argument, and their attitude of hostility or indifference to all that concerned the church was converted into one of devoted esteem for himself and his aims. His artisan admirers subscribed to give him a present of cutlery in 1883  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 13 June 1883). His success in Sheffield was only typical of what he achieved throughout the labour centres of northern England. During the latter part of his life no man equalled him in the affections of the working classes, and it is difficult to overestimate the effect of his influence in strengthening the position of the English church in the northern province. He was one of the first English clergymen who, while not himself a socialist, recognized the good elements that went to the making of socialism. When he dissented from opinions which to most people of the time seemed revolutionary, he did so without bitterness and with full allowance for differences in the point of view from which the question was approached.<h2>
<a name="Achurchdisciplinarian"></a>A church disciplinarian</h2>From the time of his elevation to the bench of bishops Thomson took an important part in ecclesiastical legislation. One of the first problems that engaged his attention was the reconstitution of the final ecclesiastical court of appeal. He was thus involved in a prolonged controversy with Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford, who was ultimately victorious. At the outset in 1871 Thomson successfully opposed Wilberforce's proposal to reduce the bishops to the position of assessors in the judicial committee of the privy council. But in 1873 a clause was introduced into the <span class="roman">Supreme Court of Judicature Act</span> removing the episcopal members from the judicial committee altogether, and, though two years later they reappeared as assessors, they did not regain their judicial functions. In 1871, with John Jackson (1811&#150;1885), bishop of London, Thomson introduced the <span class="roman">Dilapidations Act</span>, intended to compel the clergy to keep their residences and church buildings in repair. It was not, however, very happily framed, and some years later was condemned by a committee of the House of Commons. In 1874 he joined his friend Tait, by then archbishop of Canterbury, another disciplinarian of liberal origin, in introducing the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Bill</span>. The measure was intended in part to check the growth of ritualistic practices, and in its original form largely increased the authority of the bishops; the extensive modifications it received in its passage through parliament, however, partially destroyed the effect that its framers had in view. Gladstone and the Tractarians vigorously opposed the bill, and the act led to a number of notorious imprisonments. In 1883 Thomson supported Tait's motion for the appointment of a commission on ecclesiastical courts. But, though he signed the general report of the commission, he joined with a minority in issuing a dissentient report, and was the author of a severe criticism on the work of the commission which appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> for January 1884.<br>
<br>A strict disciplinarian, Thomson came conspicuously forward in 1887 as the champion of ecclesiastical order. He had refused to admit Canon Tristram's election as a proctor in convocation, on the ground that he was not duly qualified. In consequence he was required to show cause in the court of queen's bench why Tristram's election should not be accepted. Thomson conducted his case in person, and, appearing before the court on 28 November 1887, took exception to the court's jurisdiction. His pleading was successful, and the ability he displayed led Lord Coleridge, who tried the case, to remark that, had Thomson been a lawyer, he would have been the second person in the kingdom instead of the third.<br>
<br>In 1888 the <span class="roman">Clergy Discipline (Immorality) Bill</span> was introduced into parliament. It was materially altered in committee, and Thomson, disapproving of it in its amended form, hastened to London to oppose it on the third reading in the House of Lords. He pointed out that it tended to increase the cost of prosecution, and at the same time prevented an appeal to a higher court on matters of fact; the bill, after passing the third reading, was allowed to drop. In the conduct of the ecclesiastical affairs of his province Thomson displayed both strength and tact. Though he had been accused of narrowness and intolerance, he earned the gratitude of people of opinions widely different from his own, and from each other's, by interposing his authority to shield them from petty annoyance. The only clerical prosecution for doctrine or ritual which he promoted took place in 1869, when he instituted proceedings for heresy against the Revd Charles Voysey, rector of Healaugh in Yorkshire, author of <span class="italic">The Sling and the Stone</span>, who, among other things, had published a sermon entitled <span class="italic">Is every Statement in the Bible about our Heavenly Father Strictly True?</span> The case was finally decided against Voysey on 11 February 1870. The result did not, however, affect the personal friendship which had existed for many years between Voysey and the archbishop. In the judicial committee of the privy council Thomson's voice was frequently raised for toleration, and when, on 16 December 1863, Robert Gray (1809&#150;1872), the bishop of Cape Town, pronounced sentence of deposition against John William Colenso, Thomson warned him of the illegality of his proceedings. On another occasion, in the case of William James Early Bennett, he laid down the maxim that the question to consider in cases of difference is not whether a person's views are in strict accord with the teaching of their church, but whether their views are so discordant as to render toleration impossible.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Prior to the appointment of Archdeacon Crossthwaite in 1880 as bishop of Beverley, Thomson had no suffragan. He always dispatched the business of the see with punctuality, but the labour and anxiety gradually undermined his health and compounded the diabetes which affected him from about 1880. He was taken ill while boating at Keswick in September 1890 and died on Christmas day 1890 in Bishopthorpe Palace. He was buried in the churchyard of Bishopthorpe, near York. The pall was borne by working men of Sheffield. His wife, Zo&euml;, died on 30 December 1913 and was buried with her husband.<br>
