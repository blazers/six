<span class="headword">Whytehead,  Thomas</span>  (1815&#150;1843), <span class="occ">poet and missionary</span>, was born on 30 November 1815 at Thormanby, Yorkshire, the youngest son of Henry Robert Whytehead (1772&#150;1818), curate of Thormanby and rector of Goxhill, and his wife, Hannah Diana (<i>d</i>. 1844), daughter of Thomas Bowman, rector of Crayke, co. Durham. When his father died, on 20 August 1818, Whytehead's mother moved with her five girls and four boys to York. At the age of eight, Thomas Whytehead went to Beverley grammar school; he left at fifteen. Thomas's brother Robert (1808&#150;1863), an undergraduate at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1830, then prepared Thomas for entry to Cambridge. When Robert took a curacy in Swineshead, Lincolnshire, in 1833, Thomas went to visit him, and was initiated into parish life, actively assisting his brother.<br>
<br>In October 1833 Whytehead became a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, where a distinguished academic record followed: a Bell scholarship (1834); two chancellor's English medals, with poems entitled &#145;The death of HRH the duke of Gloucester&#146; (1835) and &#145;The empire of the sea&#146; (1836); the 1835 Hulsean prize for his essay entitled &#145;The resemblance between Christ and Moses&#146;; and Sir William Browne's gold medal for Latin and Greek epigrams (1836). In the classical tripos Whytehead came second in February 1837, and he used a copy of the class list to communicate the news to his sister Anne. Whytehead's letters to Anne reflect his love of home (&#145;college may be animating, but it is not <i>home</i>&#146;, June 1834) and his loneliness (&#145;I have just got a little bird in a cage to make some sort of companion for me, as I often feel as if I w<sup>d</sup> give anything for something alive like myself to keep me company&#146;, February 1834). In March 1837 he became senior classical medallist and was elected to a fellowship at St John's College. He graduated BA in 1837, MA in 1840, and in 1838 he held a classical lectureship at Clare College; he was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford in 1841. He was ordained deacon in 1839 and accepted the curacy of Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where his former college tutor I. F. Isaacson was clergyman; he was ordained priest in December 1840. Whytehead's dedication to the religious life is apparent throughout his letters and verse, and his work <span class="italic">College Life</span> (1845, 2nd edn 1856) presents a view of Oxford and Cambridge primarily as sites of spiritual and moral development. In 1835 Whytehead had volunteered himself to the Church Missionary Society, and he finally agreed to become chaplain to the newly appointed bishop of New Zealand, George Augustus Selwyn. Whytehead's health had never been strong: in particular, a recurring eye problem had dogged his studies. After sailing for Australia on 26 December 1841 he was taken ill in Sydney with a ruptured blood vessel, the precursor of a collapsed lung. He spent months there before being able to progress to New Zealand. He taught himself Maori in this time, translating two hymns, one of them Bishop Ken's evening hymn. He faced his death, as he had lived, with Christian conviction. He died on 19 March 1843 at Waimate, Bay of Islands, and was buried beside the new Waimate church building two days later.<br>
<br>Whytehead made little impression on the literary world. He was commissioned to write an ode for the installation of the duke of Northumberland in 1842 as chancellor of Cambridge University, performed to music by T. A. Walmisley. His <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1842) was sufficiently well received to prompt a second edition, published as <span class="italic">Poetical Remains</span> (1877), edited by Thomas Bowman Whytehead, who appended a memoir based on his uncle's letters. This appeared eight years after the new chapel at St John's, Cambridge, was consecrated, with its full-length painting of Whytehead on the choir roof as one of the nineteenth century's representative figures. In a minor way he was such a representative: a highly-educated clergyman poet whose writing reflected his unswerving faith.<br>
