<span class="headword">Russell,  Matthew</span>  (1834&#150;1912), <span class="occ">poet and editor</span>, was born in Ballybot, near Newry, co. Down, Ireland, the sixth and youngest child of Arthur Russell (1785&#150;1845), a master in the merchant marine, and his wife, Margaret Hamill, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mullan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1845). On his marriage to the widowed Margaret Hamill, Arthur Russell purchased a brewery in Newry. The Russells, who traced their descent from an Anglo-Norman ancestor who arrived in Ireland with Strongbow, were comfortable but not rich, and when Arthur Russell fell ill in the late 1830s, he leased the brewery and moved his family to Seafield House, a small farm at Killowen on Carlingford Lough, where the children were educated by a governess. Both parents were enthusiastic supporters of Daniel O'Connell, and both, particularly Mrs Russell, were strict Catholics; the children had to read from Alban Butler's <span class="italic">The Lives of the Saints</span> every day. Matthew Russell's uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24302/', "Charles William Russell")</script>, who became president of St Patrick's College, Maynooth, in 1857, was instrumental in converting Newman to Catholicism, as well as helping Cardinal Wiseman to edit the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>. Arthur Russell died in May 1845 and the family returned to Newry, although they continued to spend summers at Killowen. Russell's three surviving sisters all became nuns in the order of Mercy, while his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24301/', "Charles Arthur Russell (1832&#150;1900)")</script>, a barrister, rose to be lord chief justice of England in 1894.<br>
<br>Matthew Russell was educated at Castleknock College and St Patrick's College, Maynooth; he entered the Society of Jesus in 1857 and in 1864 was ordained priest. Until 1873 he did school and church work in Limerick, but in that year he moved to Dublin and founded (and edited until his death) the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, subtitled the &#145;Irish Catholic&#146;. Its first editorial announced that it was &#145;devoted to the service of the Faith and the Fatherland after which it is named&#146;, and that it would be Catholic and national in tone, with the emphasis on Catholic. Although theologically orientated in its early years, Russell began to hope that it might be &#145;the forerunner of a Catholic literature in Ireland&#146;, which he saw as &#145;the essential want of this country&#146;, since over the previous century &#145;Genius and Intelligence&#146; had been &#145;hostile to, or estranged from Catholicity&#146;, and he gradually opened the magazine to literature and even to non-Catholic writers such as Oscar Wilde and W. B. Yeats. As well as serializing stories by living writers such as Rosa Mulholland and publishing poems by Katharine Tynan, Rose Kavanagh, Dora Sigerson, and Ellen O'Leary, it also printed correspondence, work, and recollections of earlier Irish writers and politicians, including Charles Kickham, Gerald Griffin, and Thomas Davis.<br>
<br>In addition to editing the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, Russell published numerous volumes of religious and secular poems, a series of very popular devotional works, a biography of his three sisters and of the Blessed John Eudes, and an edition of Rose Kavanagh's poetry. He was also in demand as a lecturer and particularly concerned himself with speaking in support of the temperance movement. From 1877 to 1886 he served as a priest at St Francis Xavier's Church in Gardner Street, Dublin, and from 1886 to 1903 taught at University College, St Stephen's Green, before returning to his sacerdotal duties in Gardner Street until his death. W. B. Yeats described Russell in January 1889 as &#145;a Catholic priest of a most courteous, kindly, and liberal kind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>), and these qualities are evident both in his editorial policy and in his attitude towards his contributors and parishioners. Russell performed many quiet acts of charity and was particularly understanding when Katharine Tynan, one of his most assiduous contributors and correspondents, married a protestant in 1893. He died at 20 Mountjoy Square, Dublin, on 12 September 1912.<br>
