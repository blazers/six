<span class="headword">Banks,  John Sherbrooke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1811, <em>d.</em> 1857), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, baptized at Naas, co. Kildare, Ireland, on 7 October 1811, was the son of Samuel Banks, physician in HM forces, of Burton upon Trent, and his wife, Lucinda. In 1828 he was nominated to a cadetship in the Bengal army by the Rt Hon. Charles Wynn, then president of the Board of Control. Arriving in India and commissioned ensign, both in December 1829, he was posted to the 33rd Bengal native infantry, of which he became quartermaster and interpreter in 1833. He was subsequently employed on civil duties in the Saugor and Nerbudda territory. He was promoted lieutenant in October 1835, captain in January 1846, and major in 1857. In 1842 he served in Afghanistan with General Pollock's army of retribution in the march upon Kabul, and shortly afterwards was appointed to a post in the military secretariat. In this office he was brought into contact with the governor-general, the marquess of Dalhousie, whose confidence he speedily acquired. Owing to the absence of the head of the department on sick leave, it devolved upon Banks to make the arrangements for the expedition which resulted in the conquest of Pegu. Shortly after the war in 1853, he accompanied Dalhousie on a visit to British Burma, and subsequently became a member of the governor-general's personal staff as military secretary. In July 1855 he was sent to Lucknow, to communicate to Sir James Outram, the resident, the governor-general's intentions on the annexation of Oudh. Banks married at Ootacamund on 13 October 1855 Elizabeth Hutchinson, youngest daughter of Major-General Robert Bryce Fearon.<br>
<br>When Dalhousie left India in 1856 Banks joined the Oudh commission as commissioner of Lucknow, and became the trusted adviser and friend of the chief commissioner, Sir Henry Lawrence, by whom, on his deathbed, he was nominated to succeed as chief commissioner, but whom he survived only a few weeks. During the defence of the Lucknow residency, on 21 July 1857, Banks was shot through the head and killed. Banks was a man of judgement and tact, able and industrious in his duties, a brave soldier, and an excellent linguist. His widow received a special pension from the India Office for her husband's services.<br>
