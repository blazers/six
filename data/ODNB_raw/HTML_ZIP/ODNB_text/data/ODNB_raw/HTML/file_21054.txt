<span class="headword">Oxnead,  John  of</span> <span class="st"> [John  de Oxenedes]</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1293), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and chronicler</span>, was presumably born at Oxnead, Norfolk. He became a monk of the abbey of St Benet of Hulme, 9 miles east-north-east of Norwich. A chronicle of the world, from the creation to 1293, which was composed at Hulme at about the latter date, has been attributed to him. However, the only evidence for his authorship and, indeed, for his existence, is an inscription in the late thirteenth-century copy of the chronicle in BL, Cotton MS Nero D.ii, folios 217&#150;37, in which Sir Robert Cotton himself, in an inscription at the top of the first page, attributes it to John of Oxnead, monk of St Benet's of Hulme. This attribution has generally been accepted and, since the chronicle itself has no reference to John of Oxnead, Cotton must have had some other evidence, possibly a medieval inscription. However, in 1888 Liebermann stated that he found nothing to substantiate such a possibility and no John of Oxnead has been found in the abbey's records.<br>
<br>The chronicle is mainly a compilation from standard authorities, for example William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, John of Wallingford, and the chronicle of Bury St Edmunds formerly attributed to John Eversden, interspersed with additional matter concerning the history of Norfolk, but more especially that of St Benet's Abbey: although of little value for general history it is an indispensable source for local affairs. Oxnead's chronicle also has historiographic value because it is one of the East Anglian chronicles that throws light on the composition of the Eversden chronicle, from which it borrows for the annals for 1020&#150;1169 and 1258&#150;92. Bartholomew Cotton (<i>d</i>. 1321/2), another borrower from &#145;Eversden&#146;, uses Oxnead's chronicle for his annals for 1279&#150;84. From the mid-1270s, however, the variants in Oxnead's chronicle from that of Eversden become increasingly important and by <i>c</i>.1290 the Oxnead chronicle was indebted to a collection of Bury material rather than to a written-up text. For example, although the letter of Edward I of 1291, enclosing the letters of submission of the competitors for the Scottish throne to Edward's judgment, is addressed to the abbot and convent of St Edmunds, the competitors' letters are in Latin, not French as in Eversden's chronicle.<br>
<br>Two copies, both late thirteenth-century, are known of Oxnead's chronicle. Neither is copied from the other, but they descend from a common exemplar. One, the already mentioned Nero D.ii, folios 217&#150;37, is a codicological curiosity. The chronicle is on quarto-sized leaves. Each page has six, eight, ten, or twelve blocks of text copied onto it in three columns. Originally the leaves were folded, once horizontally and twice vertically, down each column. Presumably they were once kept in a pouch. Such folded manuscripts are extremely rare. Henry Ellis edited the chronicle in Nero D.ii in 1859 for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>. After he had completed his edition another copy was discovered in a historical miscellany of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in the duke of Newcastle's possession. It is now BL, Egerton MS 3142. This volume had belonged to St Benet's of Hulme until <i>c</i>.1294 when it was acquired by the Augustinian priory of Hickling (about 6 miles north-east of Hulme). It has many additions relating to the priory's history. A collation of the Oxnead text (fols. 105&#150;200<i>v</i>) was appended to Ellis's edition.<br>
