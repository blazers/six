<span class="headword">Brooks,  Ernest Walter</span>  (1863&#150;1955), <span class="occ">ancient historian and Syriac scholar</span>, was born in Hambledon, Horndean, Hampshire, on 30 August 1863, the only child of the Revd Walter Brooks, curate of Hambledon, who died when Ernest was a child, and his wife, Emily Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Browning. In September 1876 he went as a king's scholar to Eton College, where, as a pupil of F. St John Thackeray, he achieved an outstanding academic performance (winning numerous prizes, having fifteen pieces of work &#145;sent up for good&#146;, and frequently topping divisions), but it was not altogether a happy time. In November 1878 he was the victim of a particularly nasty practical joke orchestrated by M. R. James which led to a formal complaint being made by Brooks and his stepfather. James had taken a strong dislike to Brooks, describing him as &#145;not nice and a convenient object for venting one's superfluous energies upon&#146;  (Pfaff, 30). While this may have been due to a straightforward clash of personalities (the other collegers in this instance seem to have sided with Brooks), it is possible that it was also influenced by Brooks's close family relationship, via his mother, to the flamboyant historian Oscar Browning, whom James despised, and who had recently been dismissed from his post at Eton.<br>
<br>In October 1883 Brooks entered King's College, Cambridge, as a scholar, and there he again flourished academically. In addition to taking a first class in each part of the classical tripos (1886 and 1887; MA 1890), he was also Bell university scholar (1884) and Carus <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span> prizeman (1885). His relationship with Browning (who had taken up residence in King's College in 1876) developed, and after leaving Cambridge he moved to London where, as an independent scholar based at the British Museum, he became involved in researching the Browning family history as well as producing his earliest academic articles. These mostly concentrated on seventh- to ninth-century Byzantine history, and this side of his work eventually culminated in his masterful chapters dealing with the political and military history of the Eastern empire which were published in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Medieval History</span> (vol. 1, 1911; vol. 2, 1913; and vol. 4, 1923).<br>
<br>Brooks's academic reputation was built, however, upon his specialization in Syriac historical texts. He began with an edition and translation of the short Syriac chronicle of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 846 (published 1897), and continued with the publication of further Syriac chronicles attributed to authors such as Zacharias Rhetor, James of Edessa, Eliya bar Shinaya, and John of Ephesus (this last was his last major work, published in 1935&#150;6). To these can be added his editions of Syriac hagiographical texts (the lives of various Syrian Orthodox saints by John of Ephesus and others, plus the Syriac version of the life of St George), and of theological texts attributed to Severus of Antioch and Nestorius. He was not always in good health, occasionally suffering from prolonged bouts of insomnia that allowed him to work for only a few hours a day, and yet his output was not only prolific but notable for its learning, conciseness, and lucidity. His editions and translations of Syriac historical texts made them available, often for the first time, to historians of the Eastern empire and of the Near East in general, and so transformed their discipline. Unusually his scholarship won the respect of contemporary scholars not only in the West but also in the Near East (where his admirers included the Syrian Orthodox patriarch of Antioch, Ignatios Ephrem Barsaum, himself a noted Syriac scholar). His first formal recognition came with the award of an honorary doctorate by the University of Louvain (1927), which was followed (in 1938) by his election as a fellow of the British Academy. The nomination papers for the fellowship simply described him as &#145;the most distinguished Syriac scholar in England&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1927 Brooks married Ellen Amy, the daughter of Major-General G. B. Mellersh. Shortly afterwards they went to live in Geneva, but on his retirement from active research (he resigned from the British Academy in 1941) they moved to Milford-on-Sea, Hampshire, where he died, at the War Memorial Hospital, on 26 March 1955.<br>
