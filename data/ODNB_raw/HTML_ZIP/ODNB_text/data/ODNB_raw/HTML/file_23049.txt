<span class="headword">Ralph</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Ralph Luffa]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1123), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was considered by Orderic Vitalis to have been a court chaplain under William II before he became bishop in 1091, but his chief claims to fame are his establishment of the material basis of his cathedral church and chapter, and his model conduct as a diocesan according to the notions of the time. William of Malmesbury, in his <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>, says that Ralph was alone among the bishops in resisting Henry I's pecuniary exactions from the clergy, thereby winning the king's respect; indeed, that as a result of his bemoaning the poverty of his bishopric and the fire that had burned down his cathedral (1114), he was actually helped by Henry's liberality to rebuild the church. One of the bishop's charters shows that, probably after 1114, he was also eliciting donations from the laity of his diocese towards the cathedral fabric. William of Malmesbury says that Ralph raised up his see from being humble and poor &#145;to the height of glory&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis pontificum</span>, 206). Ralph gathered together as many clergy as the means of the bishopric could sustain, thus creating canons for the cathedral, he donated valuables for the liturgy to the cathedral, he travelled around his diocese three times a year preaching, and he rebuked wrongdoers with good humour. Some of this picture is given colour by the admittedly sparse charter evidence. The main pattern of cathedral prebends in the vicinity of Chichester had been clearly established no later than 1147. Charters of Ralph stress the importance of priests' attendance at episcopal synods, not for the sake of financial dues but &#145;to hear the episcopal precepts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acta</span>, 74), and the need to provide a secure material basis for the priest who would actually reside as pastor in a parish.<br>
<br>According to the chronicle of Battle Abbey the first rumblings of dispute between the bishop of Chichester and the abbey were felt in Ralph's time, over the bishop's right of hospitality and the abbot's liability to attend the bishop's synod. However, it is difficult to assess the trustworthiness of the charter and chronicle evidence, particularly on the latter issue, since it could be affected by hindsight from the certainly rancorous disputes of the mid-twelfth century. Ralph, abbot of Battle from 1107, and Bishop Ralph appear to have been the best of friends. Although not a central figure in politics, Ralph Luffa was a consistent supporter of Archbishop Anselm (<i>d</i>. 1109). He was not cowed by William II's bludgeoning, according to William of Malmesbury, but offered to resign his bishopric in support of Anselm's recognition of Pope Urban II (<i>r</i>. 1088&#150;99) in 1095, even though he felt weakened by Anselm's subsequently going into exile. Again, according to Eadmer, he acted and spoke staunchly in favour of the archbishop of Canterbury's right to exact obedience from York in 1108&#150;9. When Orderic says that of William II's chaplains who obtained bishoprics, some oppressed the weak and amassed wealth, while others, inspired by a deep sense of pastoral responsibility, devoted themselves to the welfare of their flocks and laudably amended their own lives, we must suppose that he thought of Ralph in the latter category. Ralph died on 14 December 1123, in circumstances of exemplary piety, having given all his possessions to the poor.<br>
