<span class="headword">Wakefield,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1335&#150;1395), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Worcester</span>, was from the West Riding of Yorkshire, probably from a family of modest account. His spinster sister, Alice, lived with him and was his principal legatee. Other kinsfolk included at least one other sister, the brothers John and Thomas Sneynton, Cecily Sneynton, John Thomas, and Eleanor and Joanne, daughters of Agnes. He also had &#145;poor relations&#146; in Aton in Pickering in 1395. He was a royal clerk, probably by July 1359, certainly by 1361. Exhibiting nothing more than competence, he became keeper of the great wardrobe on 27 June 1369, at the time when Edward III, and hence his court and government, were lapsing into passivity.<br>
<br>In such circumstances Wakefield, like others well placed, could direct royal patronage in the church towards himself without doing much in return: the treasurership of St Paul's Cathedral (1369&#150;75), the archdeaconry of Northampton (1371&#150;2), the prestigious archdeaconry of Canterbury (1374&#150;5), and much else. Wakefield even secured election to the small but immensely rich see of Ely in June 1373, but such was the disarray round the old king that Edward III also nominated his confessor, John Woodruff. Pope Gregory XI chose Thomas Arundel, the twenty-year-old son of Richard (II) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel, and a future archbishop of Canterbury. Undoubtedly this proved the right decision, if for the wrong reasons. On 12 September 1375 the pope awarded Wakefield the lesser see of Worcester, his share of the spoils carved out between royal and papal envoys at the concordat of Bruges; this superseded an election by the chapter of their prior, supposedly confirmed by the king.<br>
<br>Wakefield received the temporalities on 14 October 1375, and was consecrated in Hatfield on the 28th. According to scandal, his promotion also dashed the hopes of John Wyclif, who thereupon took the road to heterodoxy in his disappointment: this cannot be more than a fragment of the story. Wakefield was a court creature, and only a draught animal at that. Still, after the court had been rocked by the impeachments and accusations of corruption made in the Good Parliament of 1376, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, led a vicious counter-attack against the critics, and on 11 January 1377 put in Wakefield as treasurer of the realm, an uncompromising and unconvincing choice. As soon as Edward III died (Wakefield being an executor of his will) and a general reconciliation was mooted to look after the young Richard II, Wakefield was replaced (19 July 1377). He retired from public life (or, just as likely, was not invited to continue in it).<br>
<br>Although he attended parliaments regularly enough, Wakefield spent his last twenty years running his diocese with the same competent mediocrity by which he had acquired it. None the less, his deathbed will is a surprisingly sensitive and austere statement, with an unusual concentration of his goods upon the sick and poor, especially those among his own tenants, and &#145;particularly those who have been hurt by me&#146;  (Marett). Though his kin, servants, and three former benefices were remembered dutifully enough, there is nothing of the wider political world where he had made his fortune, scarcely more of his own diocese or even of the cathedral itself, before whose pulpit he sought burial. He died the day after he made his will, 11 March 1395.<br>
