<span class="headword">Collins,  David</span>  (1756&#150;1810), <span class="occ">colonial official and army officer</span>, was born on 3 March 1756 at Cross Street, London, the third surviving of the eleven children of Arthur Tooker Collins (1718&#150;1793) and his wife, Henrietta Caroline Fraser. His father was an officer of marines, while his mother came from a cultivated &#145;middling gentry family&#146; of Park, King's county, Ireland. His paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5934/', "Arthur Collins")</script>, a noted antiquarian and genealogist, published extensively on the British nobility.<br>
<br>Collins began his education in London, but studied at Exeter grammar school from 1765 until 1770 after his father went to Plymouth in command of a detachment of marines. He himself joined the marines as an ensign in 1770 and was gazetted second lieutenant on 20 February 1771. A year later he sailed aboard HMS <i>Southampton</i> for Denmark to take into safe keeping Queen Caroline Matilda, the wife of King Christian and a member of the British royal family. Having been arrested for a liaison with the king's physician, the queen was released following demands from England and brought home.<br>
<br>Three years later, in March 1775, Collins sailed to the American colonies, where he fought at Bunker Hill on 17 June 1775 and later rose to first lieutenant. After evacuating loyalists from Boston to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1776 he returned home and for three years was adjutant of marines at Chatham. His wife, whom he had married at St Paul's Church, Halifax, on 13 June 1777, travelled with him. She was Maria Stuart Proctor (<i>d</i>. 1830), the daughter of Captain Charles Proctor of Halifax. The couple had one daughter, who died young. Collins was promoted captain-lieutenant in August 1779 and captain in July 1780, and from February 1781 until January 1783 he served aboard the <i>Courageux</i> in the channel squadron. He took part in the relief of Gibraltar under Lord Howe, and two days before the declaration of peace, on 3 September 1783, he was placed on half pay. For the next three years he and his wife lived at Rochester in Kent. On 24 October 1786 Collins was appointed deputy judge-advocate to the detachment of marines destined for the penal settlement at Botany Bay and to a position with the same title for the settlement itself. However, his means were insufficient, obliging him to seek assistance from his father, who had helped him secure the appointment.<br>
<br>Collins served in New South Wales between January 1788 and August 1796. Experienced, level-headed, and reliable, he became Governor Arthur Phillip's confidential secretary. The departure of the marines in December 1791 reduced his responsibilities and salary, and he sought to return to England where his wife and father were ill (the latter died in 1793). Only a strong sense of duty kept him in the colony. His integrity prevented him succumbing to the corruption that arose following Phillip's departure in December 1792, when the officers of the New South Wales Corps gained power. He concentrated on his legal duties, and won praise from Phillip's eventual successor, John Hunter, for his ability and zeal.<br>
<br>Collins knew no more law than could be gained from laymen's texts and military service, and as judge-advocate he operated under difficulties; he lacked the assistance of clerks and presided over a criminal and civil court system that made no provision for trial by jury. Hampered by his lack of expertise, he followed governors' wishes too readily, doing too little to assert the independence of the judiciary. Some of his judgments were questionable, but he achieved a &#145;rough and ready&#146; justice, demonstrating that humane treatment of convicts could achieve more than undue severity.<br>
<br>In August 1795, after serving longer in New South Wales than any other first fleet officer, Collins sailed home. Despite numerous applications for promotion he was given only the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel of marines (1 January 1798), with the substantive rank of captain. While in England on half pay he successively published, in 1798 and 1802, the two volumes of <span class="italic">An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales</span> that made his name as a writer.<br>
<br>Collins's first volume drew on his extensive experiences <i>en route</i> from England and in the colony. It was a well-illustrated chronological account, with a wealth of information about events and people, much of it available nowhere else. A gregarious man, Collins had a keen eye for detail and a lively curiosity. He depicted the lives of the white settlers and devoted attention to the Aborigines, providing a description of their language and culture that was for long the best available. The second volume covered the years 1796 until 1800, the period following his departure from Sydney, but was based only on material available in England and possessed none of the detail and freshness of its predecessor. Volume 1 also had shortcomings: the writing lacked literary merit according to the conventions of the time, and revealed little of the inner workings of government or of the malpractices of the New South Wales Corps. Nevertheless, the two volumes formed one of the earliest pieces of historical writing in Australia and stand out as the most important of the journals by officers of the first fleet. Maria Collins, who wrote several novels, produced an abridgement in 1804, by which time her husband's career had taken a new turn.<br>
<br>On 4 January 1803 Collins was commissioned lieutenant-governor and sent in command of a party of troops and convicts to establish a settlement in Bass Strait designed to protect the region from French claims. He sailed aboard HMS <i>Calcutta</i>. Judging Port Phillip to be unsuitable, and with Governor P. G. King's approval, he moved to Van Diemen's Land, reaching the mouth of the Derwent River on 16 February 1804. For the next six years he controlled this penal outpost, founding a town at Hobart and a varied economy based on farming, grazing, sealing, and whaling. The region was isolated, some of the officers were corrupt, the convicts were unreliable, and supplies were uncertain. Accommodating 500 free settlers who had been sent from the former settlement at Norfolk Island between 1806 and 1808 created further problems. So too did the presence between March 1809 and January 1810 of the intemperate Governor Bligh, nominally his governor-in-chief, who had been removed from office in Sydney by the New South Wales Corps. Bligh was unduly critical of Collins, as was the British government, which accused him of failing to curb waste and fraud.<br>
<br>Collins's sudden death at Government House, Hobart, on 24 March 1810, at the age of only fifty-four, apparently in good health, aroused suspicions of suicide, or even murder by corrupt officers. A more likely cause was a coronary attack brought on by isolation, financial worries, and overwork. Whatever the case, he had lived long enough to make a mark on Australian history. The personal cost had been considerable, involving exposure to hardship and long separation from his wife and friends. In Sydney he found consolation in the company of Ann Yeates, by whom he had a son and a daughter, and at Hobart successively with the convict Hannah Power and with the Norfolk Islander Margaret Eddington, who bore him a girl and a boy. He believed that nature had intended him &#145;for the tranquil rather than the bustling walk of life&#146;, perhaps as a scholar or priest  (Collins to his father, 12 Sept 1791, Collins MSS, Mitchell L., NSW, 1.58). His career took him in other directions, but, besides his judicial work in Sydney and the settlement at Hobart, where he was buried, his enduring legacy was his book, which at least partly fulfilled his early aspirations.<br>
