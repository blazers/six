<span class="headword">Peel,  James</span>  (1811&#150;1906), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, born on 1 July 1811 in Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, was the son of Thomas Peel (<i>d</i>. 1822), a woollen draper and partner in the firm of Fenwick, Reid &amp; Co., dealers in wine and woollen cloths. He was educated at Dr Bruce's school in Newcastle upon Tyne alongside Sir Charles Mark Palmer, later a shipbuilder, and John Collingwood Bruce, who became a noted antiquary. He then studied drawing with the painter Edward Dalziel, father of the wood-engravers the Dalziel brothers. In 1840 he went to London to paint portraits and continue his studies by making copies in the National Gallery.<br>
<br>Eventually Peel concentrated on painting landscapes, finding inspiration especially in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and Wales. His pictures were remarkable for a truthful feeling for nature; he was praised for his treatment of running water and cloud-laden skies. Three of his paintings, <span class="italic">A Lane in Berwickshire</span>, <span class="italic">Cotherstone, Yorkshire</span>, and <span class="italic">Pont-y-Pant, Wales</span>, were acquired by the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, where a loan exhibition of his works was held in 1907. Others were bought by galleries in Glasgow, Leeds, and Sunderland, and for private collectors in Newcastle. On 30 May 1849, in Darlington, co. Durham, he married Sarah Martha Blyth, eldest daughter of Thomas Blyth; two sons and three daughters survived them. He lived in Darlington for a while, but in 1860 he returned to London with his family.<br>
<br>From 1843 to 1888 Peel exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. He was also a leading supporter of the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists, exhibiting there from 1845; he was elected as a member in 1871. With Ford Madox Brown, William Bell Scott, and other artists he organized &#145;free&#146; exhibitions, including ones at the Dudley Gallery and the ill-fated Portland Gallery in London. James Peel continued to work well into his nineties and died at his home, Western Elms Lodge, Oxford Road, Reading, Berkshire, on 28 January 1906.<br>
