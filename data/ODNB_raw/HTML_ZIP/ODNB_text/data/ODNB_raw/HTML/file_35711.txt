<span class="headword">Regan,  Charles Tate</span>  (1878&#150;1943), <span class="occ">zoologist and museum director</span>, was born at Long Street, Sherborne, Dorset, on 1 February 1878, the only son of Charles James Regan, music master at Sherborne School, and his wife, Maria Jane, daughter of William Tate, author of <span class="italic">The Modern Cambist</span> (1829). He was educated at Derby School and at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he studied zoology under Adam Sedgwick and was awarded a first class in part 1 (1900) and a second in part 2 (1901) of the natural sciences tripos.<br>
<br>In 1901 Regan was appointed assistant (later known as assistant keeper) in the British Museum (Natural History) and was posted to assist George Albert Boulenger in curating the collection of fishes. At the museum he made his mark, soon taking sole charge of the fishes, becoming keeper of the department of zoology in 1921 and director of the museum in 1927. Regan married on 12 July 1905 Elsie Alice (<i>b</i>. 1882), daughter of George Marlow, land surveyor. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Regan's publications numbered some 260. Among these <span class="italic">The Freshwater Fishes of the British Isles</span> (1911) embodies the results of his observations as an angler and of his museum researches in a way which makes it an authentic and readable reference book for both anglers and naturalists. He edited <span class="italic">Natural History</span> (1936), in which he wrote the section on fishes. Most of his works, however, were specialist contributions to the zoology of fishes. His anatomical studies were mainly on the skeleton, and aimed to elucidate relationships and evolutionary trends. Modifying and amplifying earlier classifications, he defined and surveyed some forty orders of fishes, producing a comprehensive classification which became accepted as a basis by ichthyologists. This was summarized in his articles on fishes and selachians in the fourteenth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. His work on the fish collections of the <i>Scotia</i> and <i>Terra Nova</i> Antarctic expeditions and on Central American fishes, among others, produced illuminating zoogeographical generalizations.<br>
<br>Regan described the complicated copulatory organs of the tiny East Indian Phallostethid fishes; and in the viviparous fishes of the Cyprinodont family Poeciliidae it was he who first showed that the clue to their classification lay in the detailed structure of the anal fin of the male. It was Regan who, in 1925, first recognized the parasitic dwarf males in certain deep-sea angler-fishes, and he later published two monographs, the second in collaboration, on the <i>Dana</i> collections of this remarkable group. To him the Danes also entrusted the description of the Stomiatoid fishes of their Atlantic and Mediterranean expeditions.<br>
<br>In 1925 Regan was president of the zoology section of the British Association meeting at Southampton, and entitled his address &#145;Organic evolution&#146;. It was his interest in evolution which led him to study and to inspire others to study the species flocks of cichlid fishes in the African lakes, but the completion of this work was left to his successors. He was also interested in the primates and their relationship to the insectivorous mammals. Of this work only a preliminary summary was published in 1930.<br>
<br>Regan was elected FRS in 1917, appointed an honorary fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1928, and awarded the honorary degree of DSc from Durham University in 1929. The greater part of Regan's administrative duties, when keeper of zoology, was devoted to improving accommodation for the collection. The New Spirit Building, based on his plan, was completed in 1930. One of his first duties as director was to report to the royal commission on national museums and galleries. The commission recommended independence from the British Museum, staff increases and immediate expenditure on new buildings. He was thus enabled to enter on his directorial period in an optimistic atmosphere with a practical plan for the reorganization of the museum according to modern ideas. The financial slump of 1929&#150;31, however, so delayed the building programme that the greater part of the plan remained unrealized when the outbreak of war in 1939 suspended work. The <span class="roman">British Museum Act</span> (1930) made the British Museum (Natural History) at South Kensington, and its director, an autonomous institution independent of the British Museum at Bloomsbury. Regan tried then, and again in 1936, to alter the official title to British Museum of Natural History in keeping with English grammar and usage, but at neither time would the trustees permit the change. During Regan's directorship women were admitted to the scientific staff for the first time.<br>
<br>When Regan retired in 1938 it was without the knighthood with which his predecessors had been honoured. He had been in poor health, and his highly strung temperament had made him unpopular with some trustees. Regan died at his home, 8 Carlton Avenue, Feltham, Middlesex, on 12 January 1943. He was survived by his wife.<br>
