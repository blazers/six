<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  William Johnstone</span>  (1766&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13729/', "John Hope (1739&#150;1785)")</script> of Craigiehall, Linlithgow, Scotland, a London merchant, and his wife, Mary <i>n&eacute;e</i> Breton (1741/2&#150;1767), was born at Finchley, Middlesex, on 16 August 1766. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13717/', "Charles Hope")</script>, judge, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13732/', "Sir John Hope")</script>, army officer, were his brothers. He was first cousin of Admiral Sir Henry Hope. He attended Edinburgh high school from 1774 to 1776. In January 1777 he entered the navy under his uncle, Captain Charles Hope (<i>d</i>. 1808), on the <i>Weasel</i>, and served with him in different ships on the home, Lisbon, and Newfoundland stations until, in October 1782, he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Daedalus</i>, serving on the Newfoundland and home stations. In 1785 he rejoined his uncle as lieutenant of the <i>Sampson</i>, guardship at Plymouth, and in March 1786 was appointed to the frigate <i>Pegasus</i>, commanded by Prince William Henry, with whom he quarrelled, in the West Indies. In May 1787 he was moved to the <i>Boreas</i>, with Nelson as captain, and in her returned to England. In 1789 he went to Newfoundland in the <i>Adamant</i> with Sir Richard Hughes, who, in 1790, promoted him commander, and appointed him acting captain of the <i>Adamant</i>.<br>
<br>Hope married, on 8 July 1792, Lady Anne Hope Johnstone (<i>d</i>. 28 Aug 1818), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13723/', "James Hope Johnstone, third earl of Hopetoun")</script>; they had two daughters and four sons, of whom Sir William James Hope-Johnstone, rear-admiral, died in 1878.<br>
<br>In 1793 Hope commanded the fireship <i>Incendiary</i> in the channel, and on 21 March 1794 was posted to the <i>Bellerophon</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Pasley, with whom he served in the battle of 1 June 1794 in the north Atlantic. In January 1795 he was appointed to the <i>Tremendous</i>, but in March was moved into the <i>Venerable</i> as flag captain to Admiral Duncan. An accidental blow on the head compelled him to resign this command in September 1796; he did not serve again until February 1798, when he was appointed to the <i>Kent</i>, again as flag captain to Lord Duncan.<br>
<br>On the surrender of the Dutch Texel fleet on 28 August 1799, Hope was sent to England with the dispatches, when he was presented by the king with &pound;500 for the purchase of a sword. He was shortly afterwards made a commander of the knights of St John by the tsar, whose fleet had been co-operating with the British. The <i>Kent</i> then went to the Mediterranean to join the fleet under Lord Keith, and in November 1800 received Sir Ralph Abercromby on board at Gibraltar, to sail to Egypt. In the early operations of the 1801 campaign Hope was present, but he resigned his command when the <i>Kent</i> was selected by Sir Richard Bickerton as his flagship, and returned to England.<br>
<br>In 1800 Hope had been elected member of parliament for the Dumfries burghs, and in October 1804 was returned for the county of Dumfries, which he continued to represent until 1830. Both constituencies were under the patronage of Henry Dundas, Lord Melville. Hope was rarely active in the house.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1804 Hope commanded the <i>Atlas</i> in the North Sea, but was obliged by failing health to resign. From 1807 to 1809 he was one of the lords of the Admiralty under Lord Mulgrave; in August 1812 he attained his flag, and from 1813 to 1818 was commander-in-chief at Leith. In 1815 he was appointed a KCB; in August 1819 he became a vice-admiral; and from 1820 to 1828 he was at the Admiralty, later becoming a member of council of the lord high admiral.<br>
<br>A well-connected Scottish conservative politician and sea officer, part of the &#145;Dundas despotism&#146;, Hope served as senior naval lord in the last decade of the unreformed Admiralty. In this period naval policy was largely developed by the controller of the navy, Admiral Sir Thomas Byam Martin, under the authority of the first lord, Lord Melville. The first naval lord's duties were light, and in peacetime predominantly political. Hope's unremarkable talents and advanced years proved unequal to the political tensions of the period following the collapse of Lord Liverpool's administration in 1827, and he was replaced by the more astute and effective Sir George Cockburn in March 1828. He was appointed treasurer of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, and, when that office was abolished, became one of five commissioners for managing the hospital.<br>
<br>On 30 October 1821 Hope married Maria <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eden, dowager countess of Athlone (1769/70&#150;5 March 1851), widow of Frederik Willem van Reede, sixth earl of Athlone. They had no children. He was nominated GCB in 1825. He resigned his parliamentary seat in 1830 and died the following year, on 2 May, in Bath; he was buried at Johnstone church, Johnstone, Dumfriesshire.<br>
