<span class="headword">Bedford,  Jessie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Elizabeth Godfrey]</span>  (1852/3&#150;1918), <span class="occ">novelist and historian</span>, was born in Twyford, Hampshire, the younger of the two daughters of the Revd James Gover Bedford (1785&#150;1871), a clergyman without parochial responsibilities, and his second wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Poulden (1818/19&#150;1919). She had at least two elder stepsisters and one stepbrother from her father's previous marriage. She contributed short pieces to <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span> (January 1890) and <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> (September 1893) before publishing her first book, <span class="italic">Cornish Diamonds</span> (1895), a novel about a talented violinist who rejects an independent career in favour of a conventional marriage. (For this and all her subsequent work she used the pseudonym Elizabeth Godfrey.) She followed it with <span class="italic">A Stolen Idea</span> (1899), a novel about a female writer who steals the idea for a successful book from the man whom she eventually marries, and <span class="italic">Poor Human Nature</span> (1898). <span class="italic">The Winding Road</span> (1903) is the tragic tale of a woman from a farming community who marries a wandering fiddle player; as in <span class="italic">Cornish Diamonds</span>, the influence of Hardy's Wessex novels was apparent. Still very readable, if often sensationalist, Bedford's novels showed a deep concern with the problems and conflicts of marriage and careers for contemporary women.<br>
<br>After the turn of the century Bedford began to publish works dealing mainly with seventeenth-century history. <span class="italic">Home Life under the Stuarts, 1603&#150;49</span> was published in 1903 and was closely followed by <span class="italic">Social Life under the Stuarts</span> (1904). Favourably if condescendingly, reviewed in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">Home Life</span> was described as &#145;excellent, delicate in flavour, vibrating with humanity, and refreshing and delightful from cover to cover&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 58). <span class="italic">English Children in the Olden Time</span>, published in 1907, was a genuinely pioneering study of the history of infancy. These three works were largely based on diaries and family papers, such as those of the Verney family, published by Parthenope and Margaret Maria Verney. <span class="italic">Heidelberg: its Princes and its Palaces</span> (1906) revealed Bedford's interest in German history, and was succeeded by <span class="italic">A Sister of Prince Rupert</span>, a biography of Elizabeth, Princess Palatine and abbess of Herford (1909). The choice of this seventeenth-century spinster and scholar, the friend of Descartes, may reflect Bedford's preoccupation with contemporary debates about women's political and educational rights.<br>
<br>Little is known of Bedford's life, although her works suggest that she spent most of her life in southern England, living in Winchester with her widowed mother. Her last years were spent at Moor Cottage, Setley, Brockenhurst, Hampshire; her interest in the New Forest is reflected in the publication of <span class="italic">The New Forest</span> (1912). She died unmarried at Grosvenor House Nursing Home, Southampton, on 22 May 1918, leaving the bulk of her property to her sister Lucy Palmer, wife of John Cecil Palmer.<br>
