<span class="headword">Williams,  Alwyn Terrell Petre</span>  (1888&#150;1968), <span class="occ">headmaster and bishop of Winchester</span>, was born at Barrow in Furness, Lancashire, on 20 July 1888, the eldest son of John Terrell Williams (<i>d</i>. 1924), medical practitioner, and his wife, Adeline Mary (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of Richard Peter, solicitor, of Launceston. He was educated at Rossall School and went up to Oxford with an open scholarship to Jesus College, where he obtained first classes in classical moderations (1908), <i>literae humaniores</i> (1910), and modern history (1911). He won the Gladstone history essay prize in 1909, and from 1911 to 1918 was a fellow at All Souls. He was ordained deacon in 1913 and priest in 1914, and in the same year married Margaret Grace (<i>d</i>. 1958), daughter of Colonel Charles Stewart, of Tighnduin, Perthshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>In 1915 the headmaster of Winchester College, M. J. Rendall, invited Williams to come and strengthen the history teaching, and a year later Williams was appointed second master, in charge of the scholars in college. In 1924 he succeeded Rendall as headmaster, and the next ten years were, as he wrote later, a time of &#145;unforgettable happiness&#146;  (Hopkins, 43). He was at the height of his powers, mental and physical, and was held in the warmest respect and affection. He was considerate, cheerful, entirely without ostentation, accessible at all times, prompt in business, a man in whom it was natural to put complete trust. He was, into the bargain, a fine historian who took a delight in teaching. Modern history and modern languages were then still held in secondary esteem in the Winchester curriculum, but Williams established them securely alongside classics, mathematics, and science. The special flavour of History Bill's teaching was relished by generations of Wykehamists, some of whom took pains to record the memorable phrases with which he lit up the past. He described the Danes, for example, &#145;carting off large ecclesiastical candlesticks and shrieking ladies and that sort of thing, pursued by slow, heavy, infuriated Saxons&#146;  (ibid., 144).<br>
<br>In 1934 Williams was appointed dean of Christ Church, where his intellectual distinction, warm humanity, and imperturbable common sense well fitted him to combine the duties of head of a college and dean of a cathedral. But his time in Oxford was all too short, for in 1939 he was appointed bishop of Durham in succession to H. Hensley Henson.<br>
<br>Williams wrote to James Duff, then warden of the Durham colleges, that he &#145;looked forward with great happiness to coming north&#146;. He was already a member of the court of Durham University, he thought the cathedral &#145;about the most magnificent place there is&#146;  (Hopkins, 58), and he admired the northern folk. He proved to be a very good bishop, less of a public figure than his redoubtable predecessor, but deeply respected and warmly welcomed everywhere in the diocese, and an excellent judge of men. But as the years went on he became increasingly anxious about his wife's health. Auckland Castle is a splendid edifice but, even in peacetime, offered formidable obstacles to domestic comfort and, indeed, to administrative convenience&#151;there was no telephone in 1939. By the end of the war the bishop, who never complained or spared himself, was suffering severely from an ulcerated stomach, the result of incessant journeying and hastily eaten sandwich lunches. In 1951 he at last agreed to undergo surgical treatment, and a year later left Durham to become bishop of Winchester. He had been deeply attached to Durham, but the move to the softer southern climate and the less isolated situation of Wolvesey Palace was a relief to his wife, and Williams himself rejoiced to return&#151;<i>quasi domum repetens</i> in the words of the memorial tablet in the college cloisters&#151;to the place where they had both been so happy.<br>
<br>The move made it easier, too, to carry on Williams's work in connection with the <span class="italic">New English Bible</span>, which entailed frequent meetings in London. He had been a member of the joint committee representing the churches and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> societies since it was set up in 1947, and in 1950 he succeeded J. W. Hunkin, bishop of Truro, as chairman. He was also convener and chairman of the literary panel, whose meetings often took up two days or more. Apart from the members of the joint committee, which had overall responsibility for policy, more than forty biblical scholars and literary advisers co-operated in the work, and it was Williams's faith in its importance and his firm but unobtrusive authority which kept this large team steady on its course. The <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was ready first and was published in 1961, and was an immediate best-seller. Williams retired from Winchester in the same year (his wife had died in 1958) and lived for the remainder of his life in Charmouth, Dorset, serene and busy to the end. He died there at his home, 3 Hillside, on 18 February 1968, when the first instalment of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was in the printers' hands. It was published, with the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> and a revised edition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, in 1970.<br>
<br>Williams was a tall, strong man, and he looked out at the world with candid, friendly eyes set in a fine, rather narrow face. He had a deep voice, much imitated at Winchester, and a most sincere and frequent laugh. He was fond of hard physical exercise but had no skill at games. At Jesus he had been captain of boats, and nearly forty years on, as dean of Christ Church, would run along the towpath in shirt and shorts encouraging the college boat. He was a great walker, covering the ground with a springy tireless stride. He was a prodigious and very rapid reader with a very retentive and orderly memory. He disliked gadgets and wrote nearly all his letters in his own beautiful firm hand. &#145;He was&#146;, wrote Duff, &#145;the wisest, kindest and best man that I've ever known&#146;  (Hopkins, 136).<br>
<br>As bishop of Winchester, Williams was prelate to the Most Noble Order of the Garter, and his first office was to install Winston Churchill. He was an honorary fellow of Jesus and All Souls colleges, an honorary student of Christ Church, and DD by decree of Oxford (1925). He received honorary degrees from the universities of Durham (1939), St Andrews (1939), Glasgow (1951), and Southampton (1962). He was chairman of the commission on training for the ministry whose Durham report (1944) recommended the setting up of a central body for the selection and training of ordinands. He wrote only one book, <span class="italic">The Anglican Tradition in the Life of England</span> (1947).<br>
