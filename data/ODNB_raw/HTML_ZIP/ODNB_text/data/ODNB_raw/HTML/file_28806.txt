<span class="headword">Washbourn <span class="st"> [Washbourne]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1607/8&#150;1687), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was the eldest son of John Washbourn esquire (1548/9&#150;1634), local politician and magistrate of Wichenford, Worcestershire, and his second wife, Elenor, daughter of Richard Lygon (<i>d</i>. 1584) of Madresfield and Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Talbot) of Salwarpe, both in the same county. He had a younger brother and sister, five half-sisters, and five half-brothers. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, as a commoner in 1622, graduated BA in 1626, proceeded MA in 1628, was incorporated at Cambridge in 1631, and proceeded BD in 1636.<br>
<br>In 1639 Washbourn was presented by Charles I to the rectory of Loddington, Northamptonshire, probably through the influence either of Bishop John Towers of Peterborough, father of a close friend, William Towers, or of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9261/', "Dr Samuel Fell")</script>, dean of Christ Church, Oxford, whose daughter Dorothy he married at Sunningwell, Berkshire, on 14 January that year. A son, Charles, was born to them at Loddington. In 1640 he resigned, and the following year was presented to Dumbleton rectory, Gloucestershire, probably by the lord of the manor. In 1643 he was nominated a prebendary of Gloucester Cathedral, and reportedly installed by night since the city was for parliament.<br>
<br>Washbourn escaped sequestration despite the fact that he was an ardent monarchist, describing Charles I's execution as &#145;a most inhuman unparallel'd Parricide, Regicide, I had almost said Deicide, for Kings are earths Deities, Gods pictures in a lesser form&#146;  (Washbourn, <span class="italic">Repairer</span>, 19). He deplored what he saw as the arbitrary regime and unelected legislature of the Commonwealth. Thus in 1650 he agonized over taking the second engagement, especially as, he stated, he had five or six small children. He sent a messenger in midwinter to Dr Robert Sanderson in Lincolnshire to ask his advice about whether he was breaking his oath of allegiance if he signed, determined &#145;not to put the world in one scale, when my soul is in the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 38). He accepted Sanderson's argument that he might interpret it as demanding the least of him, for he remained at Dumbleton throughout the interregnum. He was deeply dismayed at the breakdown of the parochial system, but saw hardship as beneficial:<blockquote>
<div>The Bush, the Church,<br>
</div>
<div>Affliction is the fire<br>
</div>
<div>Which serves not to destroy, but search<br>
</div>
<div>And try her gold, raising the value higher.<br>
</div> (&#145;The bush burning&#146;, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 73)</blockquote>He wrote many, mainly devotional, poems in the metaphysical style, circulated to his friends, which Mary, Lady Vere, persuaded him to publish as <span class="italic">Divine Poems</span> in 1654. The best show considerable merit. He did not hesitate to express his views on the current religious situation in some, with an outspokenness also evident in <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at the Funerall of Charles Cocks</span> (1655), the lord of the manor, na&iuml;vely published to dispel talk that it attacked him.<br>
<br>Loyalty to crown and church was rewarded when, in 1660, Washbourn was formally installed in his prebend and also created a DD of Oxford University by chancellor's letters. He responded with <span class="italic">The Repairer of the Breach</span> (1661) preached at Gloucester Cathedral on 29 May that year to mark the king's birthday and the first anniversary of his return. From 1660 to 1668 he was vicar of St Mary de Lode, Gloucester. He died on 6 May 1687, in his eightieth year, and was buried in Gloucester Cathedral with an epitaph which, at his own insistence, described him as the greatest of sinners and the least of ministers of God.<br>
