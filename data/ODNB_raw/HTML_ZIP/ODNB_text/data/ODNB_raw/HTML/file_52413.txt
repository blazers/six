<span class="headword">Neustadt,  Ilya <span class="st"> [Ilie]</span></span>  (1915&#150;1993), <span class="occ">sociologist</span>, was born on 21 November 1915 near Odessa, Russia, the youngest of five children of Nicolai Neustadt, a prosperous grain and sunflower seed merchant, and his wife, Maria. In the turmoil following the Russian revolution his family decided to cross the Dniester into Bessarabia, which in 1918 became part of Romania. Neustadt was educated chiefly in Bucharest, and his early interests were in biology. He considered training as a doctor or as a professional musician, being a highly talented violinist. However, as a Jew he found the political climate in Romania increasingly threatening, so he decided to continue his university education in a new country and in a new field, the social sciences. He travelled to Belgium and entered the Li&egrave;ge School of Economics, where he specialized in international politics and law. In 1939 he completed and published his doctoral thesis, <span class="italic">Le probl&egrave;me de l'organisation internationale en Europe centrale, 1919&#150;39</span>. But events in Europe now forced him into the third migration of his life and in 1940 he found a place on one of the last ferries to leave Belgium for Britain.<br>
<br>As a refugee in London, Neustadt managed to obtain a bursary from the London School of Economics, where he intended to continue his studies in politics under the supervision of Harold Laski. However, he was instead referred to Morris Ginsberg, professor of sociology, and in this somewhat haphazard way came to the subject that was thereafter to occupy&#151;in effect to be&#151;his life. Working with Ginsberg, he obtained his second doctorate with a thesis entitled &#145;Some aspects of the social structure of Belgium&#146; (1944), which focused on the changing middle classes.<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war years academic posts in sociology were hard to come by, and Neustadt (who was naturalized in 1948) stayed on for some time at the London School of Economics as a library assistant. Eventually his opportunity came, with his appointment in 1949 as lecturer in sociology in the department of economics at the University College of Leicester. It was an opportunity that he took with striking results. At first he taught single-handed all the sociology courses on offer at Leicester. In 1954, however, a department of sociology was established, Neustadt was promoted to senior lecturer, and he acquired a highly influential colleague in Norbert Elias. The department then slowly grew and in 1959, after Leicester received its university charter, Neustadt was able, with Elias's help, to devise a new sociology degree with a strong comparative emphasis. In 1962 a chair in sociology was created and Neustadt was appointed to it. Subsequently, he was able to promote a far more rapid expansion of the department. By the time of his retirement in 1981 it comprised over thirty permanent staff, making it one of the largest in Britain.<br>
<br>The department that Neustadt created was distinguished yet more by its quality than by its size. In his selection of junior lecturers, as well as students, he showed a remarkable capacity for talent-spotting. As in the 1960s and 1970s the demand for sociologists increased in other universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, Leicester products were greatly sought after, and the department regularly lost its promising youngsters to highly attractive offers from elsewhere. Neustadt never resented this, but rather took pride in the role played by his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in developing sociology in Britain and in what T. H. Marshall aptly called &#145;the legacy of Leicester&#146;. He was at least in part repaid by the many distinguished contributions to his Festschrift, edited by Anthony Giddens and Gavin Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Social Class and the Division of Labour</span> (1982). Nevertheless, Neustadt could still be reckoned the victim of his own success. His time and energy were almost totally absorbed by his constant struggle to sustain his department and by his unwavering commitment to teaching, at which he excelled&#151;his inaugural lecture was entitled &#145;Teaching sociology&#146; (1965). He was thus left with little opportunity to pursue his own academic interests. His one involvement in a major research project was begun in 1957&#150;8 while he was visiting professor of sociology at Accra, and led eventually to his editing (with Walter Birmingham and E. N. Omaboe) the two-volume <span class="italic">A Study of Contemporary Ghana</span> (1966&#150;7).<br>
<br>In retirement Neustadt hoped at last to be able to write his long-planned study of Auguste Comte. He received an invitation to spend a year as an academic visitor at Nuffield College, Oxford. Unfortunately, though, the Parkinsonism that had afflicted him for some years grew more severe and he became reluctant to move far from his house in Leicester. He died at Leicester General Hospital on 16 February 1993, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery, Leicester. He never married but to the end of his life kept a circle of devoted friends and for long maintained his reputation as a splendid host.<br>
