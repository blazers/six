<span class="headword">Peel, Sir  Sidney Cornwallis</span>, baronet  (1870&#150;1938), <span class="occ">soldier and financier</span>, was born on 3 June 1870, at 70 Eaton Place, Pimlico, London, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35450/', "Arthur Wellesley Peel, first Viscount Peel (1829&#150;1912)")</script>, and his wife, Adelaide (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of William Stratford Dugdale. His father was the fifth son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Rt Hon. Sir Robert Peel")</script>, and was himself a politician, serving as a Liberal MP (1865&#150;95), parliamentary secretary to the Poor Law Board (1865&#150;71) and to the Board of Trade (1871&#150;3), under-secretary at the Home Office (1880), and speaker of the House of Commons (1885&#150;95). He was created viscount in 1895.<br>
<br>The younger Peel was educated at Eton College where he was a king's scholar and Newcastle scholar, and at New College, Oxford, where he was placed in the first class in honour moderations and Greats. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1893. Shortly afterwards he became secretary to the licensing commission, of which his father was chairman. Based on this experience he wrote <span class="italic">Practical Licensing Reform</span> (1901). He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1898.<br>
<br>Peel served in the South African War from 1900 as trooper in the Oxfordshire imperial yeomanry, for which he received the queen's medal with three clasps. He recounted his experience in his book <span class="italic">Trooper 8008: Experiences in the Boer War</span> (1901). Shortly after the war he went to Egypt as a newspaper correspondent and this led to a further book, <span class="italic">The Binding of the Nile and the New Sudan</span> (1904). At this time he began a business association with Sir Ernest Cassel, who was active in business and financial affairs in Egypt&#151;an association which lasted until Cassel's death in 1921. This led to Peel's obtaining a number of important posts in the City of London, notably chairman of the London committee of the National Bank of Egypt (which had been founded by Cassel) and vice-president of the Morocco State Bank (also founded by Cassel). In 1901 he became an official in the National Discount Company, of which he became a director in 1911, and chairman in 1922. Also in 1911 he was appointed to the Oxford Chest at the invitation of the then chancellor of Oxford University, Lord Curzon.<br>
<br>In 1914 Peel married Lady Delia Spencer, daughter of the sixth Earl Spencer. There were no children. In the same year he became major of B squadron of the Bedfordshire yeomanry, of which he had been an officer since 1902. He became colonel in May 1915. In June 1915 he took the regiment to France, where it served as part of the 1st cavalry division. In this role, his brother later recalled, &#145;into the grisly outlook he infused a certain humour which appealed to all ranks &hellip; a splendid regiment was the result&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Dec 1938). For his services he was mentioned in dispatches and received the DSO. He recounted his war experiences in <span class="italic">O. C. Beds. Yeomanry</span> (1935). In November 1917 he was recalled to act as financial adviser to the Foreign Office. In December 1918 he was elected Conservative MP for the Uxbridge division of Middlesex, which he held until the general election of 1922. He did not stand for parliament again.<br>
<br>In his capacity as financial adviser to the Foreign Office, Peel attended the Versailles peace conference in 1919, at which he was especially concerned with the Bulgarian settlement. In 1919 he became chairman of the export credits guarantee department advisory committee, a position which he retained until his death and in which, according to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist, &#145;he did some of the most original and successful administrative work of his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Dec 1938). He became deputy steward of Oxford University in 1922, and a member of the Oxford University statutory commission on its formation in 1924, resigning when he was appointed British plenipotentiary to the tariff conference in China in 1925&#150;6. In 1927 he went to India as a member of the special committee of inquiry into the relations of the Indian states with the British government, a duty which continued until 1929. He was a member of the municipal banks committee, in 1926&#150;7, and of other government committees. For some years he was secretary of the National Trust. He was made CB in 1929 and a baronet in 1936.<br>
<br>Peel's brother wrote at his death:<blockquote>In his youth my brother was reckoned to be as efficient in mathematics as in classics. In virtue of this two-fold capacity he could master any subject with an accuracy derived from the former and with a width derived from the latter of these branches of study. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Dec 1938)</blockquote>Peel died at his home, 26 Hill Street, off Berkeley Square, London, on 19 December 1938, after a lengthy and painful illness. His funeral service was held at St Michael, Cornhill. He was survived by his wife.<br>
