<span class="headword">Barnewall,  Robert</span>, styled twelfth Baron Trimleston  (<em>c.</em>1704&#150;1779), <span class="occ">landowner and Roman Catholic activist</span>, was the eldest son of John Barnewall, styled eleventh Baron Trimleston (1672&#150;1746), and his wife, Mary, or Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1771), daughter and heir of Sir John Barnewall. Descended from an Anglo-Norman family whose estates in the counties of Meath and Dublin had been extensive, the Barnewalls had by the mid-seventeenth century begun to suffer the consequences of being prominent Roman Catholics. In 1652 the eighth Baron Trimleston was attainted and the family had its lands restored only by the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span>. The estates were again placed in jeopardy when Robert's uncle, the tenth baron, fought on the side of James II, eventually being killed in 1692. His successor, Robert's father, managed by application to the court of claims to rescue part of the estate. Robert, as a member of a proscribed religion, inherited a title which had no legal recognition; but this seems not to have dampened his aristocratic demeanour or way of life. One of three brothers, Robert was educated privately and spent much of his earlier life travelling abroad, occupying himself with the study of botany and physic. He married three times: first Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1740), daughter of James Rochfort, of Laragh, co. Kildare, and later, in or before 1757, Elizabeth, daughter of John Colt, of Brightlingsea, and Elizabeth Man, of Tooting. His third wife was Anne (<i>d</i>. 1831), the fifth daughter of William Hervey, a merchant from London, and Elizabeth Barfoot.<br>
<br>By the time he returned to Ireland to succeed to the title in 1746, Barnewall was middle-aged. Visitors to the ancestral home, Trimleston Castle, remembered him for his hospitality, his style and superb taste, and for his generosity to the local poor whose ailments he treated without charge. During his time at Trimleston an aviary and a notable greenhouse graced the estate. Much of the anti-Catholic legislation of the period was aimed at excluding Catholics from political power. Consequently such Catholic political activity as prevailed was directed primarily towards securing relief from those legal strictures. Until the mid-eighteenth century most tentative Catholic political gestures had been spearheaded by the remnants of the Roman Catholic gentry, a mantle of leadership which Trimleston believed he had inherited. One effect of the penal legislation, however, was to direct Catholic professional ambitions into commerce, and by the 1750s this had led to the growth of a strong Catholic merchant class&#151;wealthy, politically ambitious, and rivalling the more traditional landed power base of the gentry class. When in 1759 the Catholic merchants formed a representative committee to advance their aims, Trimleston led a general refusal by the gentry to participate, and proceeded to negotiate with the ruling ascendancy in person and largely without reference to the committee. His proposal to government in 1762 that Catholics be enlisted for military service came to nothing. Within a year he suffered the ultimate embarrassment when his son and heir, Thomas, conformed to the established church. Trimleston retired from politics only to re-emerge in 1775 in a further attempt to wrest control of the committee from its elected leaders. In June of that year he led a body of some sixty eminent merchants and tradesmen in a mass subscription to a contentious oath of allegiance which had already caused divisions in the Catholic community. Trimleston's action helped to resolve the controversy and soon the oath, a matter essential to those who hoped to benefit from future relief legislation, was being widely accepted by the Catholic laity. Trimleston, in all probability to the fury of the merchants who had largely guided the committee since the early 1760s, slid smoothly into the position of leader and principal spokesman. His method had not been altogether dissimilar from that used by him in 1762.<br>
<br>The committee which had taken place at the outset of the American War of Independence clearly had led to no resolution or agreement as to tactics at this critical juncture. Trimleston had seized the advantage created by the obvious policy vacuum. With a sizeable following, he revived his 1762 suggestion to government that the king's war effort might be swelled by Catholics. By this time, however, the intensity of Catholic pro-establishment fervour (the American revolutionaries had condemned the pro-Catholic <span class="roman">Quebec Act</span> of 1774) was such that it had aroused protestant resentment in Dublin, with consequent political difficulties for the government. Trimleston orchestrated the scaling-down of the enthusiasm so skilfully that he won the praise of the government and yet kept the trust of his followers in the committee whose financial support was ever essential. The likelihood that Trimleston was the leading light even among the committee's &#145;gentry&#146; members is suggested by the fact that when he relinquished the leadership his place was retaken by the merchants he had once displaced. His last apparent act as leader was the placing of his name at the head of the signatories to the Catholic address of loyalty to the new viceroy in 1777. Age and growing infirmity doubtless prevented him from playing a significant part in the agitation for the Catholic relief measure of 1778. He died in Dublin on 6 December 1779, and was buried at Trimleston. Trimleston appears to have had four children, two of whom died very young; the surviving two sons were the heir, Thomas, and Mathias, both of whom conformed to the established church.<br>
