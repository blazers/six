<span class="headword">Dolmetsch,  Carl Frederick</span>  (1911&#150;1997), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born on 23 August 1911 at 3 rue de l'Audience, Fontenay-sous-Bois, near Paris, the younger son and youngest child in the family of two sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32853/', "(Eug&#232;ne) Arnold Dolmetsch (1858&#150;1940)")</script>, a musician and musical instrument maker of Swiss descent, and his third wife, Mabel Johnston (1874&#150;1963), bass viol player and thirteenth of the fourteen children of John Brookes Johnston, a Scottish insurance broker, of Denmark Hill, London. He had an elder half-sister, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, from his father's first marriage, but saw little of her. From the age of four he was taught the viol and recorder by his father, and as a member of the family viol consort took part, with his sisters C&eacute;cile and Nathalie and brother Rudolph, in his first concert tour at the age of eight. For a time he took violin lessons with Carl Flesch and Antonio Brosa. It was he who left the bag containing his father's early eighteenth-century Bressan treble recorder on the platform at Waterloo Station in London in 1919, leading Arnold Dolmetsch, who had taken measurements of the instrument, to experiment until he was able to make his own recorder, marking the beginning of recorder making in England in the twentieth century. Although the family moved to Hampstead in 1914 they spoke French at home, and Dolmetsch never lost his Swiss accent. He was naturalized in 1931. When the Zeppelin raids began in 1917 the family moved to Jesses, Haslemere, Surrey, which remained Dolmetsch's home for the rest of his life. He was educated at St George's Wood, a girls' school in Haslemere, before leaving to work alongside his father in the Dolmetsch workshops. He took part in the first of the Haslemere festivals of early music, started by his father in 1925. On 24 February 1937 he married Mary Douglas Ferguson (1915/16&#150;1995), daughter of James Alexander Ferguson, of Dumfries; they had twin daughters and two sons, one of whom committed suicide in 1966 at the age of twenty-one.<br>
<br>In 1926 Dolmetsch was put in charge of the development and production of recorders in the Haslemere workshops. From the start he experimented with ways of &#145;improving&#146; the design of the recorder, and he invented a number of mechanical devices, including the tone projector, the bell key for high F&#9839;, and the echo key: this was operated by the chin, opening a hole in the head joint, thus sharpening the pitch and making it possible to blow softly but remain in tune. He fitted these gadgets to his own instruments for his recitals. Dolmetsch made these improvements in the belief that the recorder needed to evolve if it was to survive in the modern world. In 1939 he restored the Chester recorders, four Bressan instruments discovered in 1886, to playing condition.<br>
<br>Dolmetsch gave his first Wigmore Hall recital on 1 February 1939 with a programme including his own <span class="italic">Theme and Variations</span> for descant recorder and piano, the first solo work written for the recorder in the twentieth century. After this concert the music critic Manuel Jacobs, a pupil of Edgar Hunt, asked ten young British composers to write solo works for the recorder, with the promise of publication by Schotts. A few months later, at the London Contemporary Music Centre, Dolmetsch, with other members of his family and Edgar Hunt, performed a whole concert of modern music for the recorder, including four of these works, most notably Lennox Berkeley's sonatina.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the Dolmetsch workshops were turned over to the mass production of plastic aircraft components. With the death of Arnold Dolmetsch in 1940 and the loss of his brother Rudolph at sea in 1942, Dolmetsch took on full responsibility for the Haslemere workshops. After the war he was able to use his wartime experience to begin mass production of plastic recorders, to meet the growing demand from schools, while continuing to make hand-crafted wooden recorders for the increasing number of amateur players. He became chairman and managing director of Arnold Dolmetsch Ltd in 1963. When a boardroom dispute led to his ejection in 1978, the Dolmetsch family established a rival firm, J. and M. Dolmetsch Ltd, in Haslemere, making wooden recorders and early bows, until the liquidation of Arnold Dolmetsch Ltd in 1982, when they bought back the recorder, early keyboard, and string businesses and the Dolmetsch trade marks, to form Dolmetsch Musical Instruments. Dolmetsch remained chairman until his death.<br>
<br>After the war Dolmetsch, encouraged by Manuel Jacobs, renewed his efforts to get leading British composers interested in writing for the recorder. Each year from 1947 to 1989 (except 1948), accompanied by Joseph Saxby (1910&#150;1997), he gave a recital in the Wigmore Hall which included (except in 1951) at least one specially commissioned work by a British composer. Those who wrote for Dolmetsch included Edmund Rubbra, Arnold Cooke, Robert Simpson, Gordon Jacob, Alan Ridout, Alan Hoddinott, Nicholas Maw, and Michael Berkeley; forty-nine new works were composed in all. From 1955 many were for recorder and strings, or other instruments, performed by members of the Dolmetsch family and others. In response to Dolmetsch's suggestion of a work using the recorder as an obbligato instrument, Rubbra wrote <span class="italic">Cantata pastorale</span> (1957). In 1982 Donald Swann wrote <span class="italic">Rhapsody from Within</span> to celebrate the fifty years' partnership of Dolmetsch and Saxby. Although not all these pieces worked, because some composers did not understand the instrument, they were enormously important in building up a modern recorder repertory. Dolmetsch recorded many of the works, most of which were published. Although at first he was open-minded about the avant-garde music written on the continent from the 1960s for a new generation of players such as Frans Br&uuml;ggen, he later came to hate it, and told his composers he did not want any avant-garde gimmicks. He also lost touch with developments on the continent in the 1960s in the performance of early music, and the style of Dolmetsch and his followers came to seem very old-fashioned to adherents of the Dutch school of recorder playing.<br>
<br>Dolmetsch was the first virtuoso recorder player in England in the twentieth century, and through his recitals, broadcasts, and lecture tours in England and abroad, especially in North America, which he first visited in 1935 and where he toured annually between 1961 and 1981, he did more than anyone else to establish the recorder as a serious musical instrument. In addition to making and performing on recorders, he contributed articles to journals, wrote the widely used <span class="italic">School Recorder Book</span>, and with Layton Ring edited the series <span class="roman">Il Flauto Dolce</span> for Universal Edition. He played in every one of the seventy-two Haslemere festivals, where he had a devoted following, from 1925 until a few weeks before his death, and was director from 1940 to 1996, for many years leading the orchestra from the violin. He also started the Dolmetsch summer school in 1948. He was one of the founders of the Society of Recorder Players in 1937, and its joint musical director.<br>
<br>Dolmetsch was appointed CBE in 1954. After 1960, when he was given an honorary DLitt by the University of Exeter, he was always referred to as Dr Carl. He was divorced from his first wife, Mary, in 1961. On 15 May 1997 he married Greta Florence Matthews (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), daughter of William Matthews, soldier. She had been his secretary for nearly sixty years. He died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at Haslemere Hospital on 11 July 1997, and was buried at St Bartholomew's Church, Haslemere, on 17 July. He was survived by his second wife, Greta.<br>

<a name="cosubject_68113"></a><span class="headword">C&eacute;cile Dolmetsch</span>  (1904&#150;1997), <span class="occ">musician</span>, the eldest child of Arnold and Mabel Dolmetsch, was born on 22 March 1904 at 5 Lincoln Road, Dorking, Surrey, just before the family moved abroad to spend seven years in the United States followed by three years in France. She began viol and recorder lessons with her father at an early age, played in the family consort as a child, and performed at the Haslemere festival every year until 1990. She married Charles Leslie Clifford Ward (1901/2&#150;1989?), a craftsman employed in the Dolmetsch workshops, on 7 September 1925; they had two sons and two adopted daughters. She became an expert on the <i>pardessus de viole</i>, a descant viol, and was for many years the only person to perform on it in public. Through her research in French libraries she found music by composers such as Thomas Marc and Jean Barri&egrave;re and was able to build up a repertory for the instrument. With her sister Nathalie she founded the Viola da Gamba Society in 1948, and she became president after her sister's death in 1989. She remained active until her death from heart failure on 9 August 1997 at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, and was buried at St Bartholomew's Church, Haslemere, on 20 August.<br>
