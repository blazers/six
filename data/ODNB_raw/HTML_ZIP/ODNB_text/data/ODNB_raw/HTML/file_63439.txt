<span class="headword">Stewart,  Simon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1646), <span class="occ">naval officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland, probably in the 1580s, the son of Robert Stewart of Touccars, Ayrshire, and his wife, Agnes Hiegait, the daughter of William Hiegait and his wife, Joneta Graham. In 1610 Stewart and his brother Bernard, the laird of Barscube, attacked Robert Stewart, minister of Hoy and Braemsay, in the course of his duties. Although the matter was taken to be a private quarrel, Stewart had aroused the wrath of James VI and I and fled to Norway with his associates. Norwegian chancellery records show that in 1612 Stewart had captured a Norwegian ship and all its goods&#151;including royal gold and tolls money&#151;while in the service of the earl of Orkney. A series of pirate attacks on Norwegian ships had been sparked by the seizure of an Orkney cargo ship in Bergen in 1611, which led to complex litigation for many years to come, as many of the goods belonged to James VI and I. Attacks on Norwegian shipping and harbours by Orkney privateers were ongoing between 1612 and 1617 and Sir Robert Anstruther, the Stuart ambassador to Denmark and Norway, noted that two of the pirate skippers were named Stewart and worked on commission from the earl of Orkney. Imprisoned in Norway, Stewart escaped and fled to Sweden in 1616, where he was also noted as a pirate. This was no obstacle to his employment there and by 22 June he was taken on as a captain in the Swedish navy. The following year he commanded a ship on a reconnaissance mission to K&ouml;nigsberg, and in 1618 he commanded two ships carrying Swedish soldiers to Reval in Estonia. In 1620 he was an ensign on a Swedish admiral's ship. He may be the Captain Stewart mentioned in Swedish naval records at this time as a witness to a fatal argument between three Scottish naval officers. In 1624&#150;6 he was a lieutenant in the G&ouml;teborg shipping company. In 1627 he served as a captain in two Swedish admirals' fleets at Danzig, and in 1629 he was in another admiral's fleet at Pillau. When King Gustavus Adolphus left Stralsund to return to Stockholm Stewart patrolled the south of the Sound. On 30 May 1630 he became a vice-admiral, and was given orders to protect Swedish warships and Dutch cargo ships. Later that year he was an under-admiral in the Swedish state admiral's fleet. He commanded fleets of two to fourteen ships crossing to the German coast throughout the Thirty Years' War. Having obtained a royal patent from Charles I dated 27 September 1633 proving his noble Scottish origins, he was ennobled and introduced into the Swedish house of nobility in 1634. He owned land in Hammarby, Upland, partly received in royal donations in 1627 and 1630 and partly obtained by exchange in 1637. In May 1634 he was the admiral of a transport fleet to Pillau. On 23 May 1644 he was made a lieutenant-admiral. It is unknown when he married his first wife, Margaret Buchanan, of Scottish noble origins. She was still alive in 1643 and appears not to have divorced Stewart, nor to have accompanied him to Sweden. His second wife was a Swede, Anna Bengtsdotter Svinhufvud, who was still living in 1652; they had two children. His son Robert was a student at Uppsala University in 1636, but died shortly before his father, who died in Stockholm in November 1646.<br>
