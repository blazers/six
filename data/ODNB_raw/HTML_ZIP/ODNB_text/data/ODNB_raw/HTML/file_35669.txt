<span class="headword">Randles,  Marshall</span>  (1826&#150;1904), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister</span>, was born at Over Darwen, Lancashire, on 7 April 1826, the son of John Randles of Derbyshire and his wife, Mary Maguire. He was educated at a private school, and after engaging in business at Haslingden he was accepted as a candidate for the Wesleyan Methodist ministry in 1850; he studied at Didsbury College, Manchester. He commenced his ministry in 1853, and was stationed successively at Montrose, Clitheroe, Boston, Nottingham, Lincoln, Halifax, Cheetham Hill, Altrincham, Bolton, and Leeds. In August 1856 he married Sarah Dewhurst, second daughter of John Scurrah of Padiham; their son, Sir John Scurrah Randles, was Conservative MP for North-West Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1882 Randles was elected a member of the legal conference, and in 1886 succeeded William Burt Pope as tutor in systematic theology at Didsbury. For many years he was chairman of the Manchester district, and in 1896 was elected president of the conference. In 1891 he received the degree of DD from the Wesleyan Theological College, Montreal. He retired in 1902 from the active ministry, and died at his home, 16 Brownsville Road, in Heaton Chapel, Lancashire, on 4 July 1904; he was buried in Cheetham Hill Wesleyan churchyard in the same county.<br>
<br>A strong advocate of total abstinence, Randles first dealt with the question in <span class="italic">Britain's Bane and Antidote</span> (1864). But his pen was mainly devoted to theology on conservative lines: &#145;the deposit of evangelical truth was sacred to him, in its form and expression, as well as its substance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minutes</span>, 155). In his best-known work, <span class="italic">For Ever, an Essay on Everlasting Punishment</span> (1871; 4th edn, 1895), he defended the eternity of future punishment. Of kindred character was <span class="italic">After Death: is there a Post-Mortem Probation?</span> (1904), in which he sought to refute <span class="italic">Man's Immortality</span> (1903) by Robert Percival Downes. The view that God is incapable of suffering he strongly maintained, against James Baldwin Brown, A. M. Fairbairn, George Matheson, George Adam Smith, and others, in <span class="italic">The Blessed God: Impassibility</span> (1900). His ablest criticism of scepticism is found in his <span class="italic">First Principles of Faith</span> (1884), in which he dealt with the views of John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, and Henry Mansel. He also published <span class="italic">Substitution: a Treatise on the Atonement</span> (1877), and <span class="italic">The Design and Use of Holy Scripture</span>  (Fernley lecture, 1892), in which he incidentally acknowledged the service of the higher criticism.<br>
