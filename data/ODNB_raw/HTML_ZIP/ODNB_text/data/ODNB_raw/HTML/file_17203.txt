<span class="headword">Lupton,  Roger</span>  (1456&#150;1540), <span class="occ">college head and founder of Sedbergh School</span>, was born in July 1456 in the parish of Sedbergh, Yorkshire, possibly the son of Thomas Lupton. He was at King's College, Cambridge, from 1479 until at least 1484; he was admitted BCnL in 1484 and in DCnL in 1504. He was probably employed in the court of chancery. One Ralph Lupton, who attended Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, and who graduated BA in 1510, was also from Sedbergh; and he became a doctor of canon and civil law and is recorded as a member of Doctors' Commons on 8 October 1518, aged about forty.<br>
<br>Roger Lupton's earliest known appointment was on 15 September 1484, when he was presented by Richard III to the rectory of Harlton, Cambridgeshire. By 24 November 1500, when he was nominated a canon of Windsor, Lupton was already a chaplain to Henry VII. In this capacity he attended the king's funeral in 1509 and was one of those charged with distributing to the poor of the capital the royal bounty of &pound;400 which Henry's will provided. Lupton continued in high standing in the first years of the next reign. He was clerk of the hanaper of chancery between 27 July 1509 and October 1514 at &pound;40 per annum, served on the commission of the peace for Buckinghamshire in 1512, and acted as receiver of petitions from Gascony during the parliamentary session which opened in February 1515.<br>
<br>Lupton also acquired several ecclesiastical benefices. By December 1496 he was installed as a canon and prebendary of St Mary's College, Warwick; on 29 November 1498 he was appointed prebendary of St Michael in the same college. On 16 November 1503 he was presented to the rectory of Brancepeth, co. Durham, and on 26 October 1506, by royal grant, he was collated to the prebend of Shipton in the diocese of Salisbury, holding both benefices until his death. Admitted on 22 August 1487 to the vicarage of Cropredy, Oxfordshire, he is reported to have vacated it in October 1519. Yet some connection was maintained, for he bequeathed to this parish &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. &#145;for keeping the clock at Cropredy and ringing daily both winter and summer the curfew and day bell there&#146;.<br>
<br>But it is for his connections with the schools of Eton and Sedbergh that Lupton is chiefly remembered. He was admitted as a fellow of Eton College on 22 February 1504, a formal prerequisite of his election as provost on 24 February. Lupton is known to have entertained the countess of Richmond at the provost's lodge in 1504 or 1505, and Henry VII himself dined in the hall in October 1505. Lupton changed the face of Eton. He caused a chantry to be built in the college, completed in 1515, which still stands, and erected Lupton's tower, &#145;the great tower with double turrets, that is perhaps the most characteristic feature of Eton, leading from Schoolyard to Cloisters&#146;  (Benson, 23). On 4 July 1515 Lupton bought from Richard Dycons the manor of Pirton in Hertfordshire for the sum of &pound;500. Through licences secured in April 1516 and a deed of 1518, he arranged for the manor to pass to his successors in the provostship. He also donated to the college several rare books and manuscripts.<br>
<br>Lupton also founded a chantry at Sedbergh, first mentioned in a deed of 23 July 1523. The earliest evidence that a school was attached to it appears in a decree of 24 March 1525, issued by the archdeacon of Richmond, concerning a lady chapel in Sedbergh church where &#145;fitting place shall be kept free for the chaplain and scholars celebrating Mass and anthem&#146;; on 12 August 1527 the abbey of Coverham granted to Lupton &#145;one small close called school house Garth, on which a school house has been erected to found a free school&#146;  (Wilson, 3&#150;4). The foundation deed, signed by Lupton on 9 March 1528, provides for a priest, who shall be &#145;good, honest and of laudable conversation, be able to teach a grammar school&#146; but also be of &#145;sufficient wit and worldly policy&#146; to manage its property; he was to have a month's holiday yearly, but should provide for an able scholar to deputize in such absences. The school was to admit &#145;in especial my kinsmen, and them of Sedber, Dent and Garstall, and then all other&#146;  (ibid., 5), and its first known master was Henry Blomer, whose will was signed on 5 November 1543. A survey of dissolved institutions recorded on 20 February 1551 that there was at Sedbergh a chantry &#145;called Lupton chantry, founded for a schole and so contynued &hellip; founded by Dr Lupton to pray for his sowle and to kepe a free schole&#146;; the school was refounded by a charter dated 14 May 1552  (Leach, 2. 303).<br>
<br>In May 1527 Lupton began an association between his new school and Cambridge University, founding six scholarships at St John's College, to be offered first to natives of Sedbergh, Dent, and Garstall. He retained the right to elect the scholars during his lifetime, entrusting the task to the college thereafter. In this period he added further to his own substantial revenues. By 1526 he had vacated the rectory of Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, but took a pension of &pound;30 per annum. On 4 June 1525 he was collated to the prebend of Centum Solidorum in Lincoln Cathedral; installed on 9 November that year, he had resigned by 18 July 1528, the date of his installation as prebendary of Caistor in the same diocese. On 11 July 1529 he was named to a commission for the administration of the chancery during the absence of Cardinal Wolsey, and in November he was a member of the conference advising on the marriage of Henry VIII to Katherine of Aragon.<br>
<br>It seems that Lupton accepted the legality of the divorce. On 14 July 1534 the provost and fellows of Eton signed unanimously a repudiation of the authority of the pope in England, and acknowledged the royal supremacy. But in 1531 Henry had forced the college to surrender valuable properties in Westminster in exchange for lesser estates elsewhere; the event is remembered to this day in the rhyme<blockquote>
<div>Rex Henricus Octavus<br>
</div>
<div>Took from us more than he gave us.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The fellows may have feared that Eton would be dissolved altogether, which would explain their support for moves to depose Lupton from the provostship in 1535. By this time government policy was in a radical phase, and Lupton may have been thought insufficiently enthusiastic in the cause of change; it has been suggested that the immediate cause of his removal was a statement of his regret at the execution of John Fisher on 22 June 1535. The fellows of Eton were anxious to co-operate; it is clear that they were engaged in selecting his successor without Lupton's knowledge. In March 1536 Lupton resigned. The very next day the fellows met, arranged to inform the bishop of Lincoln (under whose jurisdiction Eton then was) of the news, and proceeded immediately to elect a successor.<br>
<br>Lupton cannot have been fundamentally opposed to the breach with Rome; he held on to his several benefices, including the canonry of Windsor. When, just before his death, he complained to Thomas Cromwell, it was in the voice of a wronged servant, not of an opponent: &#145;I have lived eighty three and a half years, and have been taken for an honest man, and now a sort of light men inform you to the contrary&#146;  (Clarke and Weech, 10). In his last will, dated 23 February 1540, he bequeathed &#145;my soul to the Holy Trinity, trusting by my faith that I have in the passion of Cryst to be saved&#146;, a formulation which bears the marks of the Reformation. Lupton died, unmarried, at Windsor on 26 February 1540 and was buried the following day in his chapel at Eton, &#145;where a monumental brass represents him vested in the distinctive cope then worn by the canons of Windsor&#146;  (Lyte, 116).<br>
