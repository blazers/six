<span class="headword">Fisher <span class="st"> [Hawkins]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1515/16&#150;1577), <span class="occ">member of parliament and landowner</span>, said to be aged thirty-three in 1549, was the son of Thomas Hawkins or Fisher of Warwick, a man of complete obscurity. Dugdale states that the son adopted the alternative surname Fisher because his father was a fishmonger, but this seems an inherently unlikely move for a man moving up the social scale; Dugdale's anecdotal material on Fisher reproduces some unreliable gossip and it is much more likely that Fisher's father bore the surnames of both his own natural father and a stepfather. A family named Fisher was prominent in Warwick between the 1520s and the 1580s, with three generations each headed by a Richard Fisher, and although no formally documented link can be established, it is possible that the Fisher surname may have been added by intermarriage with this family. Early references to Thomas use one or both surnames, most often in the version &#145;Fisher alias Hawkins&#146;, but in later life the &#145;alias Hawkins&#146; is usually omitted. His younger brother John, who served as town clerk of Warwick between 1563 and 1590, used the Fisher surname alone.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Thomas Fisher's early life, though his later career would presuppose some educational or professional attainment, possibly involving the law, like his brother. The first that is heard of him is as an official of John Dudley, then Viscount Lisle and later to be successively earl of Warwick and duke of Northumberland; in May 1542 Fisher was rewarded by him with the stewardship of Kibworth Beauchamp, Leicestershire. Shortly after this he must have transferred his loyalties to Edward Seymour, then earl of Hertford and later duke of Somerset.<br>
<br>From 1544 onwards Fisher rose rapidly in Hertford's service, flourishing as his master's power increased and becoming his secretary in 1547. In or shortly before that year he married Winifred (<i>d</i>. 1557), daughter of William Holte of Aston, a north Warwickshire gentleman with court connections whose father had served as MP for Warwick in 1529; the possibility of such a marriage into the county &eacute;lite must reflect the very substantial rise in Fisher's social standing which had followed his connection with Hertford. Fisher served with the army in France in 1546 and acted for Hertford in the campaigns against Scotland of 1547&#150;9, fighting with distinction at the battle of Pinkie, working to establish English garrisons in the Scottish lowlands, and taking part in diplomatic negotiations. When Seymour, now duke of Somerset, governed England between 1547 and 1549, Thomas Fisher naturally acquired the political influence which led to an impressive accumulation of offices and property. His position in Warwick was established by his becoming steward of the castle and bailiff of the manor, while he had obtained the site of the dissolved Austin priory of St Sepulchre, just outside the town walls, in 1546. He served as member of parliament for High Wycombe in 1547, presumably through Seymour's influence, and became keeper of Banbury Castle and bailiff of its hundred in 1550.<br>
<br>There is little record of any official activity in London in these years, but Fisher served as a tax commissioner in Warwickshire in 1550 and, more significantly, as a chantry commissioner for that county and Leicestershire in 1548, and it was from his privileged access to the confiscated lands of the guilds and chantries that he was able to establish himself as a permanent member of the Warwickshire gentry. In 1548 and 1549, Fisher acquired a number of blocks of these lands, mostly in northern Warwickshire and often in association with John Dabridgecourt. More significant than these often small and scattered holdings was the takeover in 1549, apparently after the exertion of pressure, of lands held by the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield in Tachbrook, Bishops Itchington, Chadshunt, and Gaydon, south-east of Warwick. This provided him with a consolidated estate which could be developed&#151;the priory lands, leased sections of the castle estate, and Tachbrook formed one unit, while at Bishops Itchington a policy of depopulation and the demolition of a redundant church provided the site and materials for the building of a substantial manor house. At the same time four manors in Sussex and Surrey were acquired from the bishop of Exeter.<br>
<br>However, as Fisher had been carried upwards by the rise of his master, so the fall of Somerset in 1549 dragged his servant down, for despite an apparent attempt by Fisher both to persuade Somerset to conciliate the earl of Warwick and to build bridges with the latter on his own account, the new ruler's determination to eradicate the Somerset faction led to Fisher's being imprisoned in 1549&#150;50 and having to pay a fine of &pound;1000. He was still assisting with the administration of Somerset's estates in August 1550 and was pardoned early in 1551, when he is described as resident in London as well as Warwick, but he went back to prison again in the winter of 1551&#150;2, until in May 1552 Northumberland (as Warwick had now become) conceded that he had been punished sufficiently. But the property and local standing which Fisher had built up survived this eclipse unscathed, and with the collapse of Northumberland's power when Mary became queen, his sufferings must have helped him to establish a reputation as a loyal Marian supporter. Dugdale's story of Fisher being given treasure by Northumberland to finance the Lady Jane Grey coup must be dismissed as absurd in the light of what is known of Fisher's career before and after this point. It was during the reign of Mary that Fisher's local standing reached a peak. He was appointed a JP for Warwickshire in 1554 and served as MP for Warwick in all but the first of Mary's five parliaments, a position which must reflect his domination of the town, and so of its council, which constituted the electorate, and a good deal of influence among the county gentry, who would be potential competitors for such a position. In 1554, after six years of fruitless effort, the town acquired a fresh charter, which established its full legal status as a municipal corporation, and it would be strange if its parliamentary representative had not played an important role in the negotiations surrounding such a major constitutional milestone&#151;indeed Fisher may have used the promise of such assistance to encourage his election. Some such inducement would have been advisable, for he had recently quarrelled with the town while trying to buy its burgh hall. During these years he must have been engaged on the building of his mansion on the site of St Sepulchre's, which became his seat and was known as The Priory. Its appearance is known only after its remodelling in the seventeenth century, but the house which Fisher completed about 1566 was a large one; with the castle dilapidated and lacking up-to-date accommodation, Fisher's Priory must have been the most impressive house in the locality.<br>
<br>In 1557 Winifred Fisher died, leaving one son, Edward. Her husband remarried; his second wife was Susanna, the daughter of John Horneyhold, of Hanley and Hartlebury, from an influential Worcestershire gentry family; there were no further children. Following the accession of Elizabeth, Fisher at first seems to have enjoyed further marks of official favour, being reappointed to the county bench in 1558&#150;9 and serving as escheator for Leicestershire and Warwickshire in 1559&#150;60, but apart from acting as exchequer receiver in these two counties from 1559 until 1572 or later, he did not sit in parliament again or hold any other significant office. His religious position seems to have been conservative, which would sit easily with his career under Mary, but there is no hint of any recusancy which might have compromised his later career, while he must have established good relations with the Dudleys at an early point in their resurgence under Elizabeth, for they are recorded as acting as his patrons and assisting his son after his father's death. Fisher's declining years were crowned by formal visits to The Priory by Robert Dudley in 1571 and by the queen in 1572, during her journey from Kenilworth, despite the fact that he was confined to bed with an attack of gout. He died on 12 January 1577 and was buried with his first wife in St Mary's Church, Warwick, under a tomb bearing effigies of the pair which has since been destroyed but is illustrated in Dugdale's <span class="italic">Warwickshire</span>. Dugdale claims that Fisher left an estate with an annual income of &pound;3000, a huge sum in contemporary terms which must be a gross exaggeration; it may be confused with the total value of his estate.<br>
<br>Fisher's property was inherited by his only child, <a name="cosubject_45788"></a><span class="headword">Edward Fisher</span>  (1546/7&#150;1601)<span class="occ"></span>, of Bishops Itchington, who is said to have been aged thirty when his father died. He married Katherine, daughter of Sir Richard Longe, and had two sons and two daughters. He provided the queen with dinner at the Itchington manor house during her 1572 progress, but wasted his inheritance, was accused of fraud in the sale of The Priory estate to Serjeant Puckering in 1582, and was consequently prosecuted for fraud in Star Chamber. His debts accumulated, and he died in 1601 in poverty, possibly in the Fleet prison, thus returning the family to the obscurity from which it had been so recently raised by the opportunism and political skills of his father.<br>
