<span class="headword">Staunton,  Edmund</span>  (1600&#150;1671), <span class="occ">ejected minister and college head</span>, was born on 20 October 1600, the third son of Francis, later Sir Francis, Staunton (<i>d</i>. 1639) of Birchmore in Woburn, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Staunton. He attended Eton College from 1613 until 1615, when on 9 June he matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford. On 4 October of the same year he was admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College, and in March 1617 he was transferred to a probationary fellowship. Staunton's religious conversion is said to have followed a serious illness at about the age of eighteen and a narrow escape from drowning about 1620. That year he graduated BA, and on 8 August was admitted to Gray's Inn. He proceeded MA in 1623.<br>
<br>After brief employment as a lecturer at Witney, Oxfordshire, on 19 April 1627 Staunton was instituted rector of Bushey, Hertfordshire. While serving there he married the daughter of a Mr Scudamore of Watford, but she soon died. In July 1629 he married Mary Balthorp of Bushey. In February 1633 Staunton became vicar of Kingston, Surrey, having exchanged Bushey for Kingston with Dr George Seton in settlement of a lawsuit between them. At Kingston he became known as &#145;the searching preacher&#146;, who, according to his biographer Richard Mayo, catechized the &#145;younger and ignorant sort of people&#146; and &#145;taught them also from house to house&#146;, and who:<blockquote>within a little time, partly by his powerful Preaching, partly by his holy and exemplary life &hellip; wrought a general reformation throughout the Town, both amongst Magistrates, and people; he was lov'd by all those that were Godly, and fear'd by those that were wicked. (Mayo, 11)</blockquote>Having proceeded DD in 1634, Staunton was suspended from Kingston on 24 January 1635 for his refusal to read the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, the suspension lasting approximately three-and-a-half years. He supported parliament on the outbreak of civil war, and was among the first ministers to be nominated to the assembly of divines. He was an influential member of the assembly, and was particularly involved in the work of its committee for the catechism. He preached before parliament several times, and was one of the six regular preachers in Westminster Abbey. He was instrumental in setting up a regular Thursday meeting of Surrey ministers at Kingston, and was active in moves to establish a classical presbyterian system in the county. His last years at Kingston were troubled by conflicts with religious radicals, most notably when the Kingston separatist and future Quaker John Fielder sought reparations from the town's authorities for his arrest in 1645 for holding conventicles and working on the sabbath. The arrest in Kingston in 1648 of the future Digger William Everard, and the subsequent dispute between Gerrard Winstanley and local ministers, is, however, most likely to have taken place just after Staunton's departure from the town.<br>
<br>Staunton was appointed president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 22 May 1648, following the ejection of Dr Robert Newlyn. Although he retained the incumbency of Kingston, and in 1649 signed the <span class="italic">Vindication of the Ministers of the Gospel</span> in protest against the king's execution as pastor of Kingston, his place as minister in the town was filled by Richard Mayo. At Corpus Staunton was noted for his presbyterian zeal and for his imposition of greater discipline in the college, but also for his failure to produce learned works, being reckoned, as James Metford noted, &#145;a man that had parts but idle&#146;  (Fowler, 217). Metford also claimed that Staunton &#145;labourd not to augment Learning, nor urged any other Authors but the Assemblers Catechisme: which was an ungratefull taske put on the Scholars&#146;  (ibid., 217). However, many acknowledged him to be an efficient president, and an improvement on his predecessor. From June 1652 until 1654 he also served on the university's new board of visitors.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Newlyn was reinstated to his former office and Staunton was ejected from Corpus on 3 August 1660. He retired to Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, where he continued preaching until silenced in 1662. In later years he preached privately in and around St Albans, and occasionally in London and Kingston. The meeting-house at Salters' Hall, London, was said by Robert Watts to have been built for him. His final place of residence was Bovingdon, Hertfordshire, where he compiled his will in April 1669. The manor or grange of Caldecott, in the parish of Bow Buckhill, Buckinghamshire, which he had purchased with his father in November 1628, he left in trust for the maintenance of his wife, Mary. The trustees included two ejected ministers, Dr John Conant of Northampton and Henry Cornish of Stanton Harcourt, as well as Ambrose Upton of Highgate, to whom he left his commonplace books and sermon notes. Mary was allowed to select twenty of his books in English for her own use, the bulk of the rest of his books being left to their son Francis, who was also named executor. Francis was the only one of their children to survive into adulthood, three daughters and seven sons having been buried in Kingston church before the move to Oxford. Staunton died on 14 July 1671, possibly, as Wood was informed, &#145;under a hedg, suddenly in a journey&#146;  (Clark), and he was buried in the chancel of Bovingdon church.<br>
