<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holloway,  Thomas</span>  (1800&#150;1883), <span class="occ">manufacturer of patent medicines and philanthropist</span>, was born on 22 September 1800 at Devonport, the eldest of six children and elder of two sons of Thomas Holloway (<i>d</i>. 1836), a baker formerly in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of John Chellew, a carpenter of Lelant, Cornwall. He was educated at Camborne and later at Mr John Spasshat's school in Penzance, to where the family moved in 1816. After leaving school, he assisted his mother in a grocer's shop, his father by then keeping a public house. He did not leave home until 1828, when he began a mercantile career in northern France.<br>
<br>After Holloway's return to Britain, in 1836 he set up unsuccessfully as a merchant in London, supplementing his meagre earnings by acting as interpreter at a nearby hotel. There he met Felix Albinolo from Turin, hawking his St Cosmas and St Damian ointment. After having obtained testimonials from a number of eminent London medical men, Holloway offered to go into partnership with him, but failed to provide the needed capital. In October 1837 he began advertising Holloway's Universal Family Ointment in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and other London newspapers. Hostile accounts written soon afterwards charged him with having stolen Albinolo's formula, or at least the idea and the testimonials.<br>
<br>For more than a year in 1838&#150;9, the enraged Albinolo and Holloway battled in the advertising columns of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and elsewhere, each bankrupting himself in the process. Holloway was committed to a debtors' prison, being released with his mother's financial assistance. He thereafter paid his debts&#151;including wages&#151;on the day of incurring them. Albinolo was also gaoled, and subsequently vanished from the scene. During 1839 Holloway began to make digestive pills, and moved to large premises at 244 Strand. On 12 January 1840 he married Jane Pearce (1814&#150;1875), elder daughter of John Driver, a shipwright of Rotherhithe. A plain-faced but cheerful and robust young woman, fifteen years his junior, she was expected to work very long hours, which he later claimed to have been from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. By chance or design they had no children, and indeed during the years of struggle, Jane could scarcely have been spared for child-bearing. In later life he refused to have any children in his home, preferring the less rumbustious company of dogs and horses.<br>
<br>Holloway's success as a businessman lay in his grasp of the power of publicity in an era when newspapers were springing up in Britain and throughout the world. He therefore spent on advertising all the money he could spare, this expenditure rising, according to his own publicity, from &pound;5000 in 1842 to &pound;20,000 in 1851. He regularly visited the London docks to bring his products to the notice of ships' officers and passengers, and to gain information about overseas markets. Similarly, he wrote thousands of letters to missionaries and other foreign residents, to discover the names of overseas papers in which to advertise.<br>
<br>Although Holloway freely quoted figures showing how his advertising outlay rose steadily to &pound;50,000 in 1883, no figures survive to show the proportion spent overseas or the value of his sales there. He apparently did well in the colonies. However, an attempt to manufacture in the United States, effective for a while (notably during the civil war of 1861&#150;5), ultimately failed through poor and sometimes corrupt local management and pertinacious counterfeiting by Americans, so that by 1883 he no longer had any sales there. According to the revenue stamps he bought, home turnover rose from &pound;18,000 in 1851 to about &pound;60,000 in the 1860s, dipping slightly to &pound;57,000 in the 1870s, then rising to no higher than &pound;65,000 on average in his four final years. He scarcely troubled to overhaul his products as the years passed. Technology was backward in the absence of steam machinery, pill masses and ointment being inadequately mixed, and the advertising copy seemed dated.<br>
<br>With no sons to succeed him, Holloway made up with his brother, Henry, manager of the factory, despite having taken out an injunction in 1850 to prevent his selling separately made brands of Holloway's pills and ointment. When the Strand premises were demolished to make way for the new law courts in 1867, the business removed to New Oxford Street. After the death of Henry in 1874, Thomas's brother-in-law, Henry Driver, took over as manager. The workforce grew from twenty-nine in 1851 to about a hundred in 1883.<br>
<br>Holloway's second career was as a financier. Once money poured in regularly from his medicines, he strove to make it work for him. There was never a Holloway's Bank as such, but he did in some ways operate as a banker. He regularly advanced money to private individuals in need of cash, against life-insurance policies which he held, disregarding pleas from dependants who found themselves penniless when the debtor died. Although he had an account with Coutts's Bank from 1845 onwards, every afternoon he arranged for all surplus funds in his possession to be lent out on the money market overnight. He was also famous for his skilful investment in British and overseas stocks and shares.<br>
<br>Holloway, his wife, and some close relatives moved to Tittenhurst Park, Sunninghill, Berkshire, in the 1860s. There he devoted many hours a day to poring over the daily returns from the firm and his stock and share papers. Afternoons were spent on carriage rides or billiards and the evenings on piano playing or reading aloud. An abstemious man, he drank only claret and water; the days of his earlier impromptu suppers and sing-songs were long gone, as was his urge to travel. He had no interest in organized religion or in politics.<br>
<br>Holloway's third career was as a philanthropist. He offered to set up a charitable foundation at Devonport, only to be cold-shouldered by the town fathers. With the advice of Anthony Ashley Cooper, seventh earl of Shaftesbury, he planned a sanatorium at Virginia Water for 240 middle-class mental patients, costing &pound;300,000. This was opened by the prince and princess of Wales (later Edward VII and Queen Alexandra), in June 1885; it closed in 1981. Jane Holloway, who had lived in gilded idleness ever since the firm had become prosperous, put on much weight and died of heart trouble and bronchitis in 1875, aged sixty. Holloway, in memory of his wife, decided to endow a college for women, to house 250 students. The exotic building, of white marble and red brick, comprised a double quadrangle with two lofty parallel blocks, and was of French Renaissance design, largely modelled on the Ch&acirc;teau de Chambord in France. Costing &pound;700,000, it dominated the skyline at Egham Hill. Holloway closely supervised every aspect of construction, remarking that he worked harder to spend his money than to generate it. Queen Victoria opened what she dubbed Royal Holloway College in 1886. Holloway also spent &pound;83,000 on building up a collection of paintings, some by Turner and Constable but most reflecting the best (and worst) of high Victorian artistic taste.<br>
<br>Holloway died of congestion of the lungs at Tittenhurst, on 26 December 1883, and was buried at St Michael's, Sunninghill, on 4 January 1884. He left a personal estate of &pound;596,335, plus a considerable amount of freehold property. His patent medicine business gradually declined and in 1930 was taken over by the rival Beechams Pills Ltd.<br>
