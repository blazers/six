<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wooller,  Wilfred</span>  (1912&#150;1997), <span class="occ">rugby player and cricketer</span>, was born at Wentworth, Church Road, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire, on 20 November 1912, the second of four children of Wilfred Wooller, a builder and contractor, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson (<i>d</i>. 1924). His parents had moved to Wales from Eccles in Lancashire. He was educated at John Bright School, Llandudno, Rydal School, and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1936 with a third-class degree in archaeology and anthropology. Wooller shot to fame in 1933, when, still at school, he played rugby for Wales against England. He later wrote that he was &#145;masquerading as a schoolboy&#146;  (Arlott, 73) for he was twenty and &#145;should have been up at Cambridge, but for an inability to master Latin in my entrance exam&#146;  (ibid.). He had already played minor counties cricket for Denbighshire and senior club rugby for Sale. His d&eacute;but match was Wales's first win at England's Twickenham ground (in use since 1910). It introduced Wooller as one of the dominant figures of 1930s rugby, a dynamically unpredictable and individualistic three-quarter who combined size more normally associated with a forward&#151;he was 6 feet 2 inches and 14 stone&#151;with unusual speed and football skills. A powerful runner with &#145;a huge lengthening stride, he ran like a train&#146;  (Arlott, 71), feared by opponents for his high knee-action, he made a speciality of the kick-and-chase move. His skill in this was decisive in Wales's 13&#150;12 win over New Zealand in 1935; he was twice deprived of a try by an unlucky bounce, but the ball fell on each occasion for his team-mate Richard Rees-Jones to score. He was an unusually prolific kicker of drop goals, at a time when they counted 4 points, as against 3 for a try.<br>
<br>After arriving at Cambridge as an international player, Wooller won three blues. On graduating in 1936 he moved to Cardiff to work in the coal industry and joined Cardiff Rugby Football Club. He played seventy-one matches for them, and scored thirty-six tries and thirty drop goals, and he was captain in 1938&#150;9. He won eighteen Wales caps, the last three as captain in 1939, and scored 26 points, including six tries. He also won two cricket blues, played occasional county cricket for Glamorgan in 1938 and 1939, represented Wales at squash, and appeared in friendly matches for Cardiff City Football Club.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Wooller served in the 77th heavy anti-aircraft regiment, and reached the rank of lieutenant. He was captured in Java in 1942 and spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war. One of only 500 survivors from a group of more than 3000, he lost 3 stone in captivity. After returning to Wales he was employed in 1946 by Glamorgan County Cricket Club as assistant secretary, and became secretary and captain in 1947. He retained the captaincy until 1960. He was a highly competent cricketer. As a batsman he scored a total of 13,593 runs at an average of 22.58. A fast-medium bowler who could move the ball both ways, he took 958 wickets at an average of 26.96. In 1955 he completed the &#145;double&#146; of 1000 runs and 100 wickets. A fearless close-to-the-wicket fieldsman, he took 413 catches.<br>
<br>Wooller's greatest cricket skill was captaincy. He was an autocratic, abrasive leader who believed firmly in cricket's traditional division between amateur and professional. His combative aggression, more typical of Australian than British cricketers, led the Sussex player Alan Oakman to recall: &#145;Anything I had to do with Wilfred Wooller was confrontational&#151;never malicious, but always attempting to wear you down mentally&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glamorgan County Cricket Club Yearbook</span>, 1998, 143). The journalist David Foot wrote that aggression was combined with &#145;a rare intuition, allied to a personal knowledge of the technique, and flaws, of the majority of batsmen&#146;  (Foot, 33). In 1948 he led Glamorgan, a first-class county since only 1921, to its first county championship. Success was founded on exceptional fielding. Wooller recalled &#145;We caught everything above the ground&#146;  (Foot, 31). While he never played test cricket, Wooller was asked about his availability to captain England's 1951&#150;2 tour of India&#151;he could not go&#151;and was a test selector from 1955 to 1962. Always conscious of Glamorgan's role as &#145;a county serving a nation&#146;  (Jones, 171), he encouraged the development of young Welsh players.<br>
<br>Wooller's dominant personality polarized opinion. Jim Pressdee, a young Glamorgan player, entertained RAF hutmates by cursing &#145;that bloody Wilf Wooller&#146;  (Foot, 18) in his sleep. Wooller, who as &#145;a conversational monopolist had few equals&#146;  (Foot, 22), attributed his strongly right-wing views to his time as a prisoner of war and was a fervent supporter of sporting contact with apartheid-era South Africa. The Welsh journalist John Billot recalled him as &#145;mixing exceptional charm with often brutal arrogance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, 11 March 1997). In 1958 a botched attempt to displace him as captain of Glamorgan led to civil war in the club, which culminated in the resignation of most of the committee. He retired from playing, of his own choosing, in 1960 but continued as club secretary until his retirement in 1977. In 1991 he became president of the club.<br>
<br>Wooller also worked as a journalist, reporting rugby for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> from 1946 until the paper's demise in 1960, then for the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> from 1961 to 1988. From the 1960s he was also a cricket broadcaster and was the man at the microphone when Gary Sobers became the first man to hit six sixes in a first-class over, at Swansea in 1968. His 1971 book, <span class="italic">A History of County Cricket: Glamorgan</span>, had a strongly autobiographical flavour. He also, for many years, ran his own insurance business.<br>
<br>Wooller's first marriage, in 1941, to Gillian Windsor-Clive (1922&#150;1961), was dissolved in 1946, and he married, secondly on 29 September 1948, Enid Mary James (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), optician, of Ogmore Vale, Glamorgan, the daughter of David William James, optician. His second marriage produced three sons and two daughters. He died in Llandough Hospital, Cardiff, on 10 March 1997 and was buried in Thornhill cemetery two days later. His second wife survived him.<br>
