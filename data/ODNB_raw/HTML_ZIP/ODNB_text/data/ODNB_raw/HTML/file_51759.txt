<span class="headword">Rigg,  Caroline Edith</span>  (1852&#150;1929), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, the eldest of three children, was born on 26 August 1852 in Guernsey, where her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35757/', "Dr James Harrison Rigg (1821&#150;1909)")</script>, was Wesleyan minister. Her mother, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1889), was daughter of John Smith, alderman of Worcester. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35758/', "James McMullen Rigg")</script> was her younger brother. Caroline was educated at private schools until her father moved to London in 1867, when she attended the City of London College for Ladies in Finsbury Circus. This was modelled on Queen's College, Harley Street, and, as that drew on the staff of King's College, this City &#145;branch&#146; utilized the staff of the City of London Boys' School, the model secondary school of the Taunton commissioners. In 1868 Dr Rigg became principal of Westminster Training College, and in 1872 continued his daughter's careful preparation &#145;for the instruction of others&#146; by arranging for her to attend the sister college, Southlands, then in Battersea, as an out-student for one year's training, which she passed in division 1. Caroline was a born teacher, and she was born into teaching.<br>
<br>From 1873 Caroline Rigg was head of a board school in Hammersmith, until in 1877 she was appointed headmistress of the new Mary Datchelor Girls' School. This was the first use of an obsolete City parochial charity for girls' education of the new kind. The endowment in the parish of St Andrew Undershaft had increased dramatically by the sale of a coffee house in Threadneedle Street, and the charity commissioners appointed parochial trustees to administer the funds for a girls' school. Camberwell in south London, with a growing middle-class population, was selected as the location, and land and buildings acquired in Grove Lane. Of this enterprise Miss Rigg was appointed headmistress at the age of twenty-five. Her salary was &pound;100 with capitation fees, which brought a total then considered generous for a woman.<br>
<br>One pupil remembered her mother's words on the opening day, &#145;I hope Clara won't be in her class&#151;the little fair lady with curls; she looks far too young&#146;. &#145;Little did she realise&#146;, her daughter added, &#145;the greatness of her personality and her many gifts&#146;  (Pearse, 27). In her application Miss Rigg said: &#145;Teaching with me is a passion and a pleasure&#146;  (ibid., 26). Many pupils testified to this. &#145;She had immense dignity and authority. Her absolute integrity, the unconscious influence of a dedicated personality, made it impossible to take an interview with her lightly&#146;  (ibid., 58). Her scripture and literature lessons were especially memorable, and many spoke of her beautiful voice. As the governors provided her with a secretary, she was able to teach an unusually full timetable, including Latin with the matriculation class.<br>
<br>Success depended on sheer persistent hard work and dedication. To Miss Rigg the school was her life. As well as her teaching, the organization and administration were formidable. The school opened with thirty pupils, aged eight to sixteen. Five months later there were 100, and by its fourth year 324, and no room for more. New buildings were required. The governors, to whom Miss Rigg reported monthly, were supportive. She had all the qualities of a pioneer, but the youthful headmistress was not quite of the pioneering generation. Experience of the new kind of girls' school was accumulating and these schools were using the system Miss Rigg designed for Datchelor. This was a broad academic curriculum, including science, leading to public examinations, with thorough attention to music and art, non-sectarian religious education, proper physical education, and training in social responsibility (there was a much-loved Dorcas Society). Girls were encouraged to aim at higher education and careers. Miss Rigg was always in the forefront of experiment, but her successor spoke of her &#145;power of remaining unchanged through change&#146;  (Dr Brock's memorial address, <span class="italic">Datchelor School Magazine</span>, 44, 1929, 9&#150;10).<br>
<br>It was in her attitude to her staff that Miss Rigg can be classed not so much with the pioneering as with the professional generation of women educationists. As headmistress of a secondary school she was unusual, even unique, in that she had both professional training in, and experience of, elementary school teaching. Although academically qualified members of staff, even graduates, became available, Miss Rigg wanted professional training for her staff as well. Encouraged by the inspector, she began from 1879 to select pupils to train herself, perhaps using the model of the pupil teachers of the elementary system. Several so trained became members of staff, and as the demand grew senior girls were awarded &#145;student-teacherships&#146;, and then passed on to Maria Grey College, the only one then available for this purpose. In 1888 Miss Rigg persuaded the trustees to open a training department at Datchelor, with herself as principal. A mistress of method was appointed and a lecturer in educational science. Students were admitted from other schools. Recognition by the Cambridge training syndicate was granted in 1899; in 1902 the college was inspected and recognized by the Board of Education, and from 1908 became eligible for its grants. In 1905 Miss Rigg and her vice-principal were recognized as teachers in pedagogy in the University of London, and the students became its internal students.<br>
<br>The Clothworkers' Company replaced the parochial trustees as governors of Datchelor in 1894&#150;5, and proved generous guardians. In 1909 a new scheme enabled the London county council (since 1903 the local education authority) to be represented on the governing body. School board scholars had already been admitted, and from 1909 Datchelor accepted the county council's eleven-year-old scholarship holders. By 1914 these outnumbered the fee payers by 267 to 207. Throughout her long tenure Miss Rigg kept her vision of a less socially divided school system. She herself manifested the non-sectarian nature of girls' secondary schooling, for she was a Wesleyan headmistress of a school using old endowments from an Anglican parish. An inspection of 1915 reported that Datchelor<blockquote>maintains the well-deserved reputation for earnest, high-minded work which it has gained, above all, through the long unwearying services of the Head Mistress, who shows no trace of declining energy and enthusiasm, and who continues to have the support of a loyal and most capable staff. (Pearse, 70)</blockquote>Miss Rigg served for ten years on the executive of the Association of Head Mistresses, which she represented on the board of examiners for education handwork (for she gave great importance to practical subjects).<br>
<br>Miss Rigg resigned in 1917, having over forty years built up Datchelor into one of the leading secondary schools, not only in London but in the country. She died at her home, 79 Brixton Hill, Brixton, London, on 16 December 1929. While her father was at Westminster, Miss Rigg attended the Horseferry Road Wesleyan church. When he moved to Brixton they went to the Brixton Hill church, where her memorial service was held. In the parish of St Mark, Camberwell, where Datchelor girls had been encouraged to give active social service, they proposed to place a memorial of her &#145;in the All Saints Corner of our Church&#146;. In her will Miss Rigg left bequests to the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, and to the Clothworkers' Company to provide scholarships to help girls who &#145;desire to proceed to a University&#146;  (<span class="italic">Datchelor School Magazine</span>, 44, 1929, 3).<br>
