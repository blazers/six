<span class="headword">Nossiter,  Maria Isabella</span>  (1735&#150;1759), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was the daughter of a housekeeper of George Cholmondeley, third earl of Cholmondeley (1703&#150;1770), and was probably Cholmondeley's illegitimate child; the comic actor West Digges later described her mother as &#145;a <i>favourite</i> housekeeper!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 17). The George Robert Nossiter baptized at Richmond, Surrey, on 9 September 1739, son of Thomas Nossiter, was probably the brother mentioned in her will. Little is known of her early life, save that she &#145;was possessed of a handsome fortune and genteel education&#146;  (Wilkinson, 180), until her triumphant first theatrical appearance, at the age of eighteen, when she played Juliet to the Romeo of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1572/', "Spranger Barry (bap. 1717, d. 1777)")</script> at Covent Garden on 10 October 1753. According to Digges, she had been tutored by Barry and the instructor and actor L. Sparks; her d&eacute;but had been made possible by Susanna Maria Cibber's departure for Drury Lane, and probably by the fact that she and Barry were already lovers: &#145;what added to the performance, Romeo and Juliet were really in love, and well known to be so&#146;  (Wilkinson, 180). Her initial nervousness was accentuated by the aggressive presence of Mrs Cibber, who had previously made the part of Juliet her own, &#145;with an intent by the superior force of her own effrontery, to stare away the little degree of courage she had left&#146;  (Morgan, 5). However, the audience responded sympathetically to &#145;so fine a girl, in such distress&#146;  (ibid.) and she gradually gained confidence, going on to reprise the part on a number of occasions. She was thought by many to be the equal of Mrs Cibber, and by some to have surpassed her. Her natural poise and elegance were generally praised; she was possessed of a &#145;pleasing figure&#146; and &#145;genteel accomplishments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span>, 1.93), with a &#145;natural bloom&#146;  (Morgan, 6) that obviated the need for make-up, though <span class="italic">The Gray's Inn Journal</span> (20 October 1753) spoke for many in recognizing her need for further training in &#145;the management of her voice&#146; and the attainment of &#145;a more simple elocution&#146;. On 14 November she played opposite Barry again, as Belvedira in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, &#145;and in the mad scene did wonders from tuition, attention and strong understanding&#146;  (Wilkinson, 181). On 11 December she played the Countess of Rutland in <span class="italic">The Earl of Essex</span> by Henry Jones, and then on 22 January 1754 she took on the lead role in <span class="italic">Philoclea</span>, &#145;brought forward and wrote purposely to show her to advantage by McNamara Morgan&#146;, the play's author  (Wilkinson, 181), who had earlier published a glowing eulogy of her talents as Juliet. For her first benefit night, on 18 March, she reprised her role as Juliet, a part with which she was always associated.<br>
<br>Nossiter now lived with Barry in Bow Street, but when her partner quarrelled over money with the Covent Garden impresario John Rich the couple decamped to act at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, where Barry received &pound;800 for the season and Nossiter &pound;500. They returned to Covent Garden for the 1755&#150;6 season; she made her first appearance as Monimia in Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> on 12 December, &#145;which she performed to a crowded audience&#146;  (Wilkinson, 220), and she played many roles opposite Barry, including Cordelia in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, Lady Pliant in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Double Dealer</span>, and Desdemona in <span class="italic">Othello</span>. She had a second benefit night on 29 March 1756. The initial praise for her d&eacute;but was now something of a distant memory, and she was less employed in the 1756&#150;7 season, although she added a new part when she played Statira in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span>, after George Anne Bellamy, who was beginning to be preferred over her, broke her arm; she repeated the role for her benefit on 28 March 1757. She missed the next season completely, and when she returned to Covent Garden for the 1758&#150;9 season (leaving Barry in Dublin to promote his new theatre in Crow Street, in which she was assigned an eighth share of the profits), she was replaced as Juliet by Mrs Bellamy. She reprised her Lady Pliant and again took a variety of roles, being last seen as Aurelia in <span class="italic">The Prophetess</span> by John Fletcher, on 18 April 1759. She died aged twenty-four at her Bedford Street address on 25 April 1759, of a broken heart according to Mrs Bellamy, after Barry had formed a new liaison in Dublin with Ann Dancer, a young widow and aspirant actress whom he later married. In fact, whatever the effect of Barry's desertion, she probably died of consumption, being &#145;naturally of a delicate constitution, which the fatigues of her profession made more so&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span>, 1.95). She had made a will on 8 August 1758 and it remained unaltered. &#145;By her death, however, she testified her connections with her Romeo were of the purest kind; as by her will she left him sole executor and legatee of her effects, which amounted in cash, clothes and jewels to upwards of &pound;3,000&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 17). The money included her eighth share in the profits of the Crow Street theatre. She also left &pound;50 to her brother, George Robert Nossiter, and her &#145;wearing apparell&#146; to her maid, Mary Collins  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
