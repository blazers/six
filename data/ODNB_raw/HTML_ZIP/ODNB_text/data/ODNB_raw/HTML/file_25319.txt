<span class="headword">Shelton,  Thomas</span>  (1600/01&#150;1650?), <span class="occ">stenographer</span>, is believed to have been descended from the prominent Norfolk landowning Shelton family, although there is no firm evidence for his parentage or early life. Probably the most famous shorthand inventor of his day, he was teaching in London from the early 1620s until his death, probably in London some time early in 1650. In 1630 he was living in Cheapside, but by 1642 had moved to Old Fish Street and by 1645 to The Poultry. His wife may have been the Ann Shelton who was buried on 6 October 1650 at St Giles Cripplegate.<br>
<br>Shelton's earliest and most successful shorthand system, <span class="italic">Short-Writing</span>, was registered with the Stationers' Company on 17 April 1626; no copy of this edition appears to have survived. <span class="italic">Short-Writing</span> was reissued in 1630 and 1633. In 1635 an updated version, renamed <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span>, was published in Cambridge, the first of several such editions to be produced by the university press there. <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span> was first printed in London in 1639, with at least twenty-two further editions up to 1710, several of them pirated. Both <span class="italic">Short-Writing</span> and <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span> incorporate many of the features of Edmond Willis's scheme of 1618 (<span class="italic">An Abreviation of Writing by Character</span>), as well as some elements of John Willis's earlier system (published anonymously as <span class="italic">The Art of Stenographie</span>, 1602). One of the most popular systems of its time, Shelton's tachygraphy was in use until at least the late eighteenth century, when it was employed by Thomas Jefferson. Among others known to have favoured his system are John Rushworth, Samuel Pepys, and the English civil war army secretary, Sir William Clarke.<br>
<br>In 1642 Shelton issued a companion volume, <span class="italic">A Tutor to Tachygraphy</span>, with two further editions in 1642. Both the <span class="italic">Tutor</span> and the 1647 edition of <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span> were reprinted by the Augustan Reprint Society of Los Angeles in 1970. A Latin translation of <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span>, <span class="italic">Tachy-Graphia</span>, appeared in 1660 and again in 1671. <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span> was also translated into both French (Paris, 1681) and German (Leipzig, 1743). A new version of <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span> by an anonymous author, combining it with some of the features of Jeremiah Rich's system, was produced in 1684 as <span class="italic">The Art of Short Writing According to Tachygraphy</span>, with, apparently, a further edition in 1705, of which no copy is known to have survived.<br>
<br>Late in 1649, just before he died, and perhaps because of the appearance of several illicit editions of <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span>, Shelton completed a wholly new shorthand system entitled <span class="italic">Zeiglographia</span> (1650). Never as popular as the tachygraphy for which he is chiefly remembered, this was the first shorthand system ever to be advertised, both separately (BL, Harley MS 5921, fol. 29<i>r</i>) and in the newsbook <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> (no. 18, 3&#150;10 October 1650, and subsequent issues).<br>
<br>Shelton's <span class="italic">Whole Book of Psalms in Meeter</span>, containing the metrical psalms of Sternhold and Hopkins, written in his system of tachygraphy and engraved by Thomas Cross, appeared posthumously, probably <i>c</i>.1660. Shelton was renowned for taking down in shorthand the sermons of leading puritan divines, and his record of twenty-three &#145;exercises before sermons&#146;, delivered by the radical Independent minister Walter Cradock, <span class="italic">Divine Drops Distilled</span>, was printed in 1650.<br>
<br>Shelton's own religious sympathies emerge clearly in <span class="italic">A Centurie of Similies</span> (1640), his only published work which was totally unconnected with shorthand. Vigorously puritanical in tone, it may account for Shelton's appearance, along with its printer Ralph Mabb, before the court of high commission in April&#150;November 1640. Shelton also had connections with the radical MP Richard Knightley (<i>d</i>. 1639), to whom he dedicated <span class="italic">Short-Writing</span> and early issues of <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span>; his own support for the parliamentarian side during the English civil wars is clear from his dedication of <span class="italic">Zeiglographia</span> (1650) to the newly established Commonwealth, to which he wished &#145;heavenly grace and earthly glory&#146;.<br>
<br>The earliest known portrait of Shelton prefaces the 1647 edition of <span class="italic">Tachygraphy</span> (which gives his age as forty-six), with re-engraved versions appearing in <span class="italic">Zeiglographia</span> (1650), <span class="italic">The Whole Book of Psalmes</span> (1660?), and <span class="italic">Tachy-Graphia</span> (1660).<br>
