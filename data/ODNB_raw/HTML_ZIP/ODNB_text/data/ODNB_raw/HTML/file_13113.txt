<span class="headword">Hervey,  James</span>  (1714&#150;1758), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born on 26 February 1714 at Hardingstone, near Northampton, son of William Hervey (1679/80&#150;1752), rector of Collingtree and Weston Favell. He was taught by his mother until aged seven, and was then sent to the free grammar school in Northampton, where he learnt Latin and Greek under a Mr Clarke. In 1731 he went up to Lincoln College, Oxford, where his tutor was Richard Hutchins, later to become rector; the then rector, Dr Euseby Isham, appointed him shortly after he entered the college to a Creweian exhibition of &pound;20 p.a., which he held until September 1736. He was for four years a student of civil law, but he changed faculties after the college told him that to qualify for holy orders he must hold the degree of BA. For the first two years he was idle, receiving little guidance from his tutor. In 1733 he joined the Oxford Methodists and came under the powerful influence of John Wesley, who unofficially taught him Hebrew. Having been admitted in April 1736 to the degree of BA, he was ordained deacon on 19 September by John Potter, bishop of Oxford.<br>
<br>Accounts differ as to whether Hervey now returned home to serve for a short time as his father's curate. By the end of 1736 he was curate to Charles Kinchin, one of the Oxford Methodists, at Dummer, near Basingstoke, Hampshire; the curacy was briefly held before him by another Oxford Methodist, George Whitefield. In June 1737 he refused the invitation of the inhabitants of Collingtree to settle among them. In 1738 he moved for two years to Stoke Abbey, Devon, the estate of Paul Orchard, another Oxford friend; they signed a pact on 28 November 1738 stating that they had been brought together by providence and agreeing to watch over each other's conduct. After Orchard's death Hervey provided a sketch of his friend's character in the dedication of the second volume of <span class="italic">Meditations and Contemplations</span> (1747) to his godson, Orchard's son Paul. In December 1739 he was ordained priest at Exeter, and from 1740 he was curate of Bideford, Devon, for two and a half years. During this period he firmly committed himself to the doctrines of free grace and justification by faith that he was to teach for the rest of his life, and embarked on what was to be an extraordinarily successful literary career. His friends collected money to raise his small stipend to &pound;60 p.a. In 1743 the new rector of Bideford, who disliked his views, dismissed him, and although the parishioners offered to maintain him he returned to Weston Favell to act as curate to his father. His health, always precarious, became much worse, and in June 1750 his friends tricked him into staying in London in order to convalesce, partly with Whitefield and partly with his brother, William, in Miles's Lane. He did not return until May 1752, when on his father's death he succeeded to the family livings of Weston Favell and Collingtree. In order to hold both livings, jointly worth &pound;160 or &pound;180 p.a. (out of which he paid his curate, Abraham Maddock), he had by a tortuous and expensive process to obtain an MA at Cambridge and dispensation from the archbishop of Canterbury before being instituted by the bishop of Peterborough. He was thus able to support his mother and sister, with whom he lived at Weston for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>As an evangelical or gospel clergyman Hervey thought differences between denominations over forms of prayer and manner of worship unimportant; what mattered was correct doctrine. He told Isaac Watts in an admiring letter of 10 December 1747 that he had introduced Watts's hymns into his church services. In a letter of 18 August 1748 to an unidentified recipient he wrote, &#145;Though I am steady in my Attachment to the established church, I would have a Right-hand of Fellowship, and a Heart of Love, ever ready, ever open, for all the upright evangelical Dissenters&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Collection of Letters</span>, 1.264). There seem to have been particularly open relationships between churchmen and dissenters in Northampton and the surrounding area. His friends and correspondents in the established church were mostly Methodists or of an evangelical persuasion: Wesley, Whitefield, James Stonhouse, Thomas Hartley, Moses Browne, the countess of Huntingdon, and Lady Frances Shirley. His chief friends among the dissenters were Philip Doddridge (who dedicated <span class="italic">Christ's Invitation to Thirsty Souls</span> to him in 1748), Risdon Darracott, John Collett Ryland, Richard Pearsall, and William Cudworth. He sent many of these friends manuscript copies of his works in progress, asking for comments and corrections both theological and literary.<br>
<br>As a writer Hervey had two main aims: to propagate the Reformation theology that he believed, like other members of the evangelical movement, had been abandoned by the Church of England, and to draw on the intellectual and aesthetic interests of the wealthy and polite in order to draw them to Christ&#151;&#145;to bait the Gospel-Hook, agreeably to the prevailing Taste&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Collection of Letters</span>, 2.101). With this end in view he combined his extensive interest in physico-theology (derived mainly from Keill's <span class="italic">Anatomy</span>, Derham's <span class="italic">Physico-Theology</span> and <span class="italic">Astro-Theology</span>, and Pluche's <span class="italic">Spectacle de la nature</span>) and classical and modern poetry (especially Homer, Virgil, Milton, Thomson, and Edward Young) with a commitment to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as the central text of literature as well as religion. His most popular work, <span class="italic">Meditations and Contemplations</span> (1746&#150;7; rev. edn., 1748), consisted in its final form of six parts in two volumes. The first volume contained &#145;Meditations among the tombs&#146;, &#145;Reflections on a flower-garden&#146;, and &#145;A descant upon creation&#146;, and the second &#145;Contemplations on the night&#146;, &#145;Contemplations on the starry heavens&#146;, and &#145;A winter-piece&#146;. The first two parts, dedicated to the daughter of George Thomson, vicar of St Gennys, Cornwall, were first printed as pamphlets by Samuel Richardson. Hervey's peculiar ecstatic style, which delighted huge numbers of readers and disgusted some critics, was the result of his attempt to combine the language of puritan meditation with that of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and Shaftesbury's <span class="italic">Moralists</span> (though he never mentioned the latter). His ideal was what he called Christ's style: &#145;Majestic, yet familiar; happily uniting Dignity with Condescension; it consists, in Teaching his Followers the <i>sublimest Truths</i>, by spiritualizing on the most <i>common Occurrences</i>&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Meditations</span>, 2.xiv). He reinterpreted for the eighteenth century the ancient notion of God's two books of nature and scripture, teaching his readers &#145;the Christian's <i>Natural Philosophy</i>&#146; by encouraging them to view the world with an evangelical telescope and with an evangelical microscope  (ibid., 1.185&#150;6).<br>
<br>Hervey's second substantial work, <span class="italic">Theron and Aspasio</span> (3 vols., 1755; two rev. edns in the same year), which was intellectually far more demanding than the <span class="italic">Meditations</span>, was devoted to what he regarded as the key gospel doctrine, the imputation of Christ's righteousness to sinners (the importance of this doctrine was flagged in a note to the <span class="italic">Meditations</span>, 1.274&#150;5n.). The narrative, in the form of seventeen dialogues and twelve letters, portrays the slow conversion to Reformation Christianity of the polite and cultivated Theron by his friend Aspasio (who resembles Hervey in his earlier literary tastes and his preference for the <span class="roman">Bible</span>). Theron thinks this is not a religion for gentlemen. The process whereby he is brought to believe otherwise is a skilful combination of the puritan conversion narrative with Shaftesburian dialogue. The argument is supported both by analysis of the precise meaning of biblical texts and by much quotation from Milton and Young. The polite reader is enticed by descriptions of landscape and works of art and by physico-theological illustrations, a process Hervey called setting apples of gold in pictures of silver. He intended to write a further volume on gospel holiness, for which he sketched a plan, but instead he felt obliged to defend his theological principles from Wesley's attack.<br>
<br>Though Hervey described himself as a moderate Calvinist, when Wesley read <span class="italic">Theron and Aspasio</span> in print (he had commented on the first three dialogues in manuscript) he decided that Hervey was &#145;a deeply-rooted Antinomian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of the Rev. John Wesley</span>, 3.230) whose views would dangerously undermine holiness. Hervey ignored Wesley's lengthy critical letter of 15 October 1756, so Wesley included it in <span class="italic">A Preservative Against Unsettled Notions in Religion</span> (1758). With encouragement from Cudworth, whom Wesley intemperately described to Hervey as &#145;an evil man&#146; (29 November 1758, ibid., 4.47), Hervey spent his dying months preparing a clear and carefully argued defence of his theological principles, supported by much discussion of biblical texts in Hebrew and Greek. Shortly before his death he told his brother William not to publish it, as its transcription for the press was not complete, but after a surreptitious edition appeared William brought it out as <span class="italic">Eleven Letters from the Late Rev. Mr Hervey, to the Rev. Mr John Wesley</span> (1765) (in later editions it was entitled <span class="italic">Aspasio Vindicated</span>). The deeply wounded Wesley said that Hervey died &#145;cursing his spiritual father&#146;  (ibid., 4.295).<br>
<br>Hervey had mixed feelings about writing mainly for the polite. His aim was to be a polished shaft in God's quiver (<span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 49: 2), an image he often referred to in correspondence. He was reluctant to cut <span class="italic">Theron and Aspasio</span>, &#145;lest it should be like wiping the Bloom from the Plumb, or taking the Gold from the Gingerbread&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Collection of Letters</span>, 2.125), but at the same time he was anxious to reach a wide audience who would be discouraged by the size and cost of a three-volume edition. These fears proved groundless. Both <span class="italic">Meditations</span> and <span class="italic">Theron and Aspasio</span> were printed in two sizes at different prices, octavo and duodecimo, and achieved enormous sales, usually in editions of 5000 or 6000. He gave away all the proceeds of his publications in charity to the poor; the <span class="italic">Meditations</span> brought <i>c</i>.&pound;700. An extempore preacher who rarely used notes, he published only a few sermons in his lifetime, <span class="italic">The Cross of Christ the Christian's Glory</span>, preached at the visitation of the archdeacon of Northampton (1753), and three fast sermons (1757). These were evangelical in content and deliberately plain in style. He wrote critical <span class="italic">Remarks on Lord Bolingbroke's Letters on the Study and Use of History</span> (1752) at Lady Frances Shirley's request, originally as private letters. He was passionately interested in seventeenth-century puritan and Calvinist writing, his favourites being Walter Marshall, Benjamin Jenks, and the Dutch theologian Witsius. As a result of his recommendation in the third edition of <span class="italic">Theron and Aspasio</span> of Marshall's <span class="italic">Gospel-Mystery of Sanctification</span> as his desert-island choice besides the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, it was republished with a statement dated 5 November 1756 that until he resumed his own account of holiness it was to be regarded as the fourth volume of his own work. He also provided recommendations for Richard Burnham's <span class="italic">Pious Memorials</span> and Jenks's <span class="italic">Meditations</span>.<br>
<br>Hervey died on Christmas day 1758 in Weston Favell and was buried three days later in the parish church. William Romaine, in a funeral sermon preached at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, on 4 January 1759, gave a full account of his activities as a clergyman but left his writings to speak for themselves. Their popularity held until the middle of the nineteenth century&#151;<span class="italic">Meditations</span> had reached twenty-six editions by 1800&#151;and then evaporated. Critical reaction was mixed. Evangelical dissenters such as John Collett Ryland and Thomas Gibbons saw Hervey as an exponent of the true sublime. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (30, 1760, 379) described his manner and writings, particularly his published letters, as conceited and effeminate. William Cowper thought him &#145;one of the most Spiritual &amp; truly Scriptural Writers in the World&#146;, but later laughed at an acquaintance who formed his style on <span class="italic">Theron and Aspasio</span>  (<span class="italic">Letters and Prose Writings of William Cowper</span>, ed. J. King and C. Ryskamp, 5 vols., 1979&#150;86, 1.141, 2.360). John Newton warned ministerial students not to imitate him: &#145;though his luxuriant manner of writing has many of the excellencies both of good poetry and good prose, it is in reality neither the one nor the other&#146;  (J. Newton, <span class="italic">Plan of Academical Preparation for the Ministry</span>, 1782, 48). Modern distaste should not deprive him of his role as one of the most widely read writers of the evangelical revival.<br>
