<span class="headword">Macbean,  Forbes</span>  (1725&#150;1800), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Inverness on 1 July 1725, the son of Alexander Macbean (<i>c</i>.1684&#150;1762) and his wife, Marjory (<i>d</i>. 1766). His father was minister of the High Church in Inverness and so militant a Presbyterian as to earn the nickname John Knox of the North; he was also fiercely anti-Jacobite and in the circumstances it is hardly surprising that Forbes and two of his foster brothers, Robert and William, sons of the Revd Archibald Bannatyne, minister of Dores, Inverness-shire, should follow military careers. Forbes Macbean entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet-matross on 3 August 1743 and passed out as a lieutenant-fireworker, Royal Artillery, on 4 April 1745. He was immediately posted to Flanders and had charge of two guns at the battle of Fontenoy. Having been ordered home in 1745, in consequence of the Jacobite rising, he joined the army of William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, at Lichfield and served at the siege of Carlisle in December. He did not accompany the duke to Scotland but the fact of his being a serving officer subsequently enabled his father to intercede with Cumberland on behalf of some deserters condemned to death after Culloden. In the meantime Forbes returned to Flanders, where he commanded a pair of light battalion guns attached to the 19th foot at the battle of Rocoux, and again at Laffeldt in the following year.<br>
<br>In November 1753 one of Macbean's foster brothers, Robert Bannatyne, joined the East India Company's Madras army, and some months later Macbean too volunteered to go to India with one of three Royal Artillery companies ordered there under Major John Chalmers. His application was unsuccessful, which was probably just as well, for only four of the twenty-two officers in the three companies ever returned home and Robert Bannatyne was killed at the storming of Conjeeveram in 1759. Nevertheless as a result of the departure of these companies Macbean was promoted lieutenant on 1 March 1755 and further promoted captain-lieutenant on 1 April. Next, offered a posting to Ireland, he instead purchased the adjutancy at Woolwich, a post that he held until promoted captain on 1 January 1759. In April of that year he was ordered to Germany, where he commanded a brigade of heavy artillery, most notably at Minden on 1 August 1759, after which he received an autograph letter from the allied commander, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, who wrote: &#145;I have reason to be infinitely satisfied with your behaviour, activity and zeal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 6.457), together with a rather more practical gratuity of 500 crowns. He again distinguished himself at Warburg, on 30 July 1760, and at Fritzlar, on 12 February 1761, before returning home on sick leave.<br>
<br>In 1762 Macbean went to Portugal with Count Wilhelm von Lippe, who had formerly been the allied artillery commander under Brunswick and had been commissioned to modernize the rather dilapidated Portuguese army. At Lippe's request Macbean was commissioned a colonel in the Portuguese artillery in 1763 and made inspector-general of Portuguese artillery two years later. Having relinquished this appointment in 1769 Macbean then commanded a company of Royal Artillery in Canada until 1773, before returning home, having been made a brevet major on 23 July 1772. A brevet lieutenant-colonelcy followed on 29 August 1777, and in March 1778 he was appointed commander, Royal Artillery, in Canada, in succession to Major-General Thomas Phillips. In anticipation of an invasion in 1780 he was assigned a field command at Sorel but the Americans failed to oblige and he saw no further action. Thereafter however he was successively promoted colonel (brevet) on 20 November 1782 and colonel, Royal Artillery, on 1 December, major-general on 12 October 1793, and lieutenant-general on 1 January 1798; on 25 September 1793 he was appointed colonel-commandant of the invalid battalion Royal Artillery. It is not known when or where he married his wife, Ann (1729/30&#150;1818), but two sons followed him into the army. The elder, Frederick, was colonel of the 6th foot and had six sons of his own, all soldiers. Two died young; two, Frederick and Forbes, became colonels; and two, William and Archibald, became generals. Forbes Macbean, regarded as a scientific soldier, was made fellow of the Royal Society in 1786. He died at his home, at Woolwich Common, on 11 November 1800; his wife, who survived him by many years, died at Greenwich in 1818, aged eighty-eight.<br>
