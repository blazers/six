<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanhope,  John Roddam Spencer</span>  (1829&#150;1908), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Cannon Hall, outside the village of Cawthorne, near Barnsley in the West Riding of Yorkshire, on 20 January 1829. He was the younger son and fourth of the five children of John Spencer Stanhope (1787&#150;1873) and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Wilhelmina Coke (<i>d</i>. 1873), daughter of the agricultural reformer Thomas William Coke (Coke of Norfolk), first earl of Leicester of the seventh creation. His father&#151;a reckless traveller in wartime Europe, fellow of the Royal Society, thrice-published author, and eventual bookish recluse&#151;was the first in a long line of solid Yorkshire proprietors to show signs of originality. His mother had painting lessons from Gainsborough (her sisters, Lady Andover and Lady Anson, became amateur artists of some distinction). Cannon Hall contained no treasures of art, but at Holkham Hall the earls of Leicester had assembled a remarkable collection. These two strains, John Spencer Stanhope's stubborn determination to do whatever he wanted&#151;and not to do anything he did not&#151;and Elizabeth Coke's aesthetic sophistication, were combined in their son. &#145;I never saw anything so crazy as Roddy is on pictures&#146;, admitted his mother in 1850  (Stirling, <span class="italic">Painter of Dreams</span>, 291).<br>
<br>Stanhope was educated at Rugby School (arriving just after Thomas Arnold's death in 1842) and Christ Church, Oxford (BA, 1851). After university, with a letter of introduction from Ruskin's friend Henry Acland, he entered into an informal apprenticeship with the painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts, which lasted seven years and introduced him to the milieu of Sara Prinsep's salon at Little Holland House. None of his paintings from this period is known to survive. On a visit to Florence during the early 1850s Stanhope concluded that &#145;all the great painters lived before Raphael's time&#146;  (Stirling, <span class="italic">Painter of dreams</span>, 325). He remained, in this literal sense, a pre-Raphaelite to the end of his days. In 1857 he and Watts produced brightly coloured, sharply focused pictures in the style of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Stanhope began work on two paintings describing a young girl's descent into prostitution, <span class="italic">Robins of Modern Times</span> (exh. Liverpool Academy, 1860; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Thoughts of the Past</span> (exh. RA, 1859; Tate collection). In subject, at least, these were probably inspired by Watts's painting <span class="italic">Found Drowned</span> (1848&#150;50, Watts Gallery) as well as by Holman Hunt's <span class="italic">The Awakening Conscience</span> (1853&#150;4; Tate collection). That summer Rossetti brought his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Edward Burne-Jones to Little Holland House and, impressed by his work, recruited Stanhope to help decorate the new debating chamber of the Oxford Union with scenes from Malory's <span class="italic">Morte d'Arthur</span>.<br>
<br>This project marked the birth of the &#145;second generation&#146; of Pre-Raphaelites, of which Stanhope is generally held to be a part. After the murals were complete he rented the room below Rossetti's apartment in Blackfriars where he painted <span class="italic">Thoughts of the Past</span>, incorporating the view from the window overlooking the Thames. Rossetti's influence on Stanhope was brief but crucial, transforming him from a gifted amateur into a professional artist. That of Burne-Jones, of whom he became a close friend, was more profound. Indeed Burne-Jones worried that he might have overwhelmed Stanhope's artistic personality, concluding, years later, that it was &#145;a great pity he ever saw my work or that he ever saw Botticelli's&#146;  (Lago, 77). There is no evidence that Stanhope felt this, however, and with lengthening hindsight it is becoming clear that his individuality was a sturdier thing than his friend understood.<br>
<br>Stanhope married, on 10 January 1859, Elizabeth (Lilla) Dawson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wyndham-King; she was the daughter of John James King and Charlotte Henrietta Wyndham, granddaughter of Turner's patron George Wyndham, third earl of Egremont, and widow of George Frederick Dawson, a captain in the Royal Engineers who died at Sevastopol. Their only child, Mary, who was born on 9 November 1859 and died of scarlet fever in 1867, was buried next to Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the English cemetery at Florence. Lilla also had a daughter from her first marriage, born after her husband's death in 1855 and named Georgina Frederica in his memory.<br>
<br>In 1860 the newly married Stanhope commissioned a house, Sandroyd, at Cobham in Surrey, from his architect friend Philip Webb (only his second, after Red House for William Morris). Stanhope was a life-long sufferer from severe asthma and hoped the country air would bring him relief. In this he was disappointed and only four years later moved on, buying a house on Campden Hill, on the green edge of fast-expanding London, and beginning to winter regularly in Italy. During the late 1860s he also established a base in Cawthorne, where he set up a studio in a small converted barn. Hill House, a farmhouse on the Cannon Hall estate made suitable for gentlemanly occupation, was put at his disposal, partly so that he could be close to his parents, who were in declining health. They died, within a week of one another, in 1873. That year Stanhope sold Little Campden House and bought Villa Nuti, on Bellosguardo, overlooking Florence.<br>
<br>Stanhope was proud of his Yorkshire roots. &#145;He looks like what he is&#146;, observed Lady Paget, who knew him in Florence, &#145;a Yorkshire squire, though his pictures are of the severest Pre-Raphaelite type&#146;  (Paget, 2.301). He was consciously a northern artist, and exhibited regularly at the Liverpool Academy (1858&#150;63) and at the Royal Manchester Institution (1865&#150;90). He did important work in churches near Cannon Hall, most notably at St John the Evangelist, Hoylandswaine (<i>c</i>.1870; painted over in 1961). For Stanhope, as for the Renaissance artists he admired, ecclesiastical work was a significant part of his production. In association with his friend the church architect George Frederick Bodley he also undertook major schemes for Marlborough College chapel (1875&#150;9; reworked 1885&#150;7), considered by an obituarist &#145;the work by which he is likely to be best known in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Aug 1908), and for Holy Trinity, Florence (<i>c</i>.1892&#150;6).<br>
<br>Stanhope's niece Wilhelmina Stirling remembered him as being &#145;equally at home in Bohemia or in fashionable society&#146;  (Stirling, <span class="italic">Life's Little Day</span>, 105). Unlike Rossetti, Burne-Jones, or Watts, he was a regular exhibitor (between 1859 and 1872) at the Royal Academy. However, during the same period (1865&#150;74) his work was also shown at the Dudley Gallery, stronghold of the &#145;poetry without grammar&#146; school, a group of young artists led by Robert Bateman (1842&#150;1922) and including Walter Crane, with whom he was loosely affiliated.<br>
<br>After their initial experiments with Pre-Raphaelitism neither Watts nor Stanhope had continued to work in that style for long. During the 1860s Stanhope developed a mature, personal style synthesizing up-to-the-minute aestheticism with the older tradition of the Italian Renaissance. He became the leading artist of what was sometimes derided as &#145;the pseudo-quattrocentist school&#146;  (C. Phillips, &#145;The Grosvenor Gallery&#146;, <span class="italic">Academy</span>, 10 May 1884, 337) because its members were thought to paint in derivative imitation of the Italian artists of the fifteenth century (the <i>quattrocento</i>). They included Crane, Stanhope's former studio assistant John Melhuish Strudwick, and his niece Evelyn De Morgan. Familiar from childhood with his grandfather's extensive collection of classical and Renaissance art, Stanhope felt comfortably at home in a continuous, living tradition rooted in the distant past. He was a pioneer of the tempera revival, and his use of this yolk-of-egg medium, superseded by oil paint during the sixteenth century, contributed to what seemed to some the anachronistic look of his paintings from the early 1870s onwards.<br>
<br>The critical high-point of Stanhope's career came in 1874, when the Pre-Raphaelite brother F. G. Stephens hailed <span class="italic">The Banks of the Styx</span> (exh. Dudley Gallery, 1874; priv. coll.) as &#145;a fine work, exceptionally excellent in all the higher qualities of painting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 31 Oct 1874, 582&#150;3). Stanhope fought hard to capitalize on this moment of recognition, exhibiting regularly at the prestigious Grosvenor Gallery from its opening in 1877, when he showed what may be his masterpiece, <span class="italic">Love and the Maiden</span> (exh. Grosvenor Gallery, 1877; Legion of Honor Museum, San Francisco). His contributions to this show were praised by the young Oscar Wilde in his first published writing&#151;&#145;there is extreme loveliness in this figure of Love by Mr Stanhope, and the whole picture is full of grace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>, July 1877, 121&#150;2)&#151;but by almost no one else. Even Stephens damned him with faint praise and suggested that his work was &#145;the result of culture, over-refinement, and caprice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 5 May 1877, 583&#150;4). The critical tide had turned against him, permanently, as it turned out. &#145;He was really an artist&#146;, Burne-Jones recalled, &#145;and he wanted to be praised and encouraged, and wasn't so; it was all uphill to him&#146;  (Lago, 76). In 1880, finally conceding, perhaps, that his ambitions as an artist were likely to remain unfulfilled in his lifetime, he emigrated permanently to Italy, though he continued to paint, and to send work back to England for exhibition, until the end of his life. His last great painting was probably <span class="italic">Patience on a Monument</span> (exh. Grosvenor Gallery, 1884; priv. coll.).<br>
<br>In 1890, after Manchester Art Gallery had bought Frederic Leighton's masterpiece <span class="italic">Captive Andromache</span> for its permanent collection, Stanhope gave the gallery his own most ambitious painting, <span class="italic">The Waters of Lethe</span> (exh. Grosvenor Gallery, 1880) so that future generations might have the opportunity to compare the pictures and perhaps assign him the place in the front rank he never ceased to feel that he deserved. He died on 3 August 1908 at Villa Nuti, and was buried in the Allori cemetery in via Senese, Florence.<br>
