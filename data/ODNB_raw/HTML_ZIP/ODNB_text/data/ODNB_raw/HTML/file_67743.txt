<span class="headword">Worth,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1669), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Killaloe</span>, was born in co. Cork of unknown parents and background. In 1638 he was elected to one of the scholarships reserved for natives of Ireland at Trinity College, Dublin. In 1645 he was appointed dean of Cork. As the protestants of the district divided between supporters of Charles I and of the Westminster parliament, Worth gravitated to the latter. Late in 1649, after Cromwell had landed in Ireland, he joined Broghill in negotiations which resulted in a section of the Munster protestants accepting the authority of the recently created English Commonwealth.<br>
<br>Worth seems to have remained in south Munster during the early 1650s, at Ringrone outside Kinsale, the living of which he had held formerly and perhaps still served unofficially. In November 1654 Lord Cork heard him preach publicly. Shortly afterwards Worth attested that Cork did not clandestinely use the proscribed <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. He was also master of St Stephen's Hospital in Cork. He re-emerged in 1653 as a champion of doctrinal orthodoxy when he tried to refute, first by preaching and then in print, the ideas of the Baptists which had recently been introduced into Cork. A wish to check the spread of heterodox opinions (including those of the Quakers) drew Worth deeper into public activity. Under the government of Lord Deputy Fleetwood, religious novelties were tolerated and even promoted. However, the arrival of Henry Cromwell to replace Fleetwood in 1655 inaugurated a more conservative approach to religious questions: an approach congenial to Worth. Early in 1655 he had tried to hinder a petition circulating in co. Cork which requested that Fleetwood continue as Irish lord deputy. Within co. Cork he organized an association of ministers, modelled after that which Richard Baxter had created in England. The aim was to vet the learning and opinions of would-be ministers before they were ordained. By this device, it was hoped to impose better discipline on the church of the area and offer a model for the rest of Ireland.<br>
<br>Winning Henry Cromwell's approval, Worth grew in importance. Already in the spring of 1655 he had been inserted into panels which were to decide on the competence and orthodoxy of various aspirant ministers. In 1656 he first accepted a modest salary (&pound;60 p.a.) from the state as one of its authorized preachers, at Kinsale. In 1656 he joined with other &#145;classical Presbyterian ministers&#146; around Cork to establish a weekly lecture from which the sectaries were excluded. By December 1657 he had been added to the panel in Dublin which adjudicated the qualifications of all aspiring preachers in Ireland. In 1658 Worth travelled to England where he met others&#151;notably at Oxford and Cambridge&#151;who shared his aims of reviving a parochial and tithe-supported ministry. Above all, he and his followers insisted on the need for ordination, and planned, through the association, to oversee the process by guaranteeing minimum standards. Only then, it was argued, would the conversion of the Irish Catholics proceed apace.<br>
<br>Worth's influence reached its zenith while Henry Cromwell governed in Dublin. A convention of ministers, summoned to Dublin in 1658, attempted to hammer out a formula which would restore greater order to the fragmented protestant churches in Ireland. During the meeting, Worth preached at St Werburgh's Church in the shadow of Dublin Castle. His congregation included many of the governors of Ireland. No national agreement resulted from the gathering. Worth's schemes had been resisted by Samuel Winter, provost of Trinity College and leader of the religious Independents. Winter also advocated associations of the clergy, but with divergent emphases. After radicals replaced Cromwell in the summer of 1659, Worth lay low. However, he maintained contact with the like-minded in Scotland and England, such as Richard Baxter. Early in 1660, when a coup brought more conservative elements to the fore in Ireland, Worth went to London. There he enquired after suitable recruits to minister in Ireland. In addition, he may have positioned himself the better to secure his own and the Irish church's future in the impending restoration. Certainly he was among those consulted shortly after Charles II's return about how best to settle the church. Worth advocated, but fruitlessly, a version of the moderated episcopacy previously championed by Archbishop Ussher.<br>
<br>Worth returned to Ireland where, early in 1661, he was consecrated bishop of Killaloe. This appointment testified to Worth's pliancy, happy enough to return to the church in which he had originally been ordained. But it also told of the need of the Church of Ireland to attract some of those who had collaborated with the Cromwellians. The diocese of Killaloe was impoverished by the extensive lay impropriation of livings. Worth strove to recover some of its alienated wealth, but antagonized the powerful, such as the O'Briens, earls of Thomond, who held much church property. During the 1660s Worth acted as a conduit between the Irish episcopate and Archbishop Sheldon of Canterbury. He died unmarried on 2 August 1669 while in Hackney in Middlesex, and was buried that month at St Mildred's, Bread Street, London. Worth had inherited modest property. During his career he amassed more. He bequeathed money to maintain poor scholars at St Stephen's Hospital in Cork and at Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
