<span class="headword">Home,  Robert</span>  (1752&#150;1834), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born in Hull on 6 August 1752, and baptized on 15 September that year at Holy Trinity, Kingston upon Hull. The son of Robert Home (1713&#150;1786), former army surgeon, of Greenlaw Castle, Berwickshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1795), daughter of Colonel Alexander Hutchinson, Robert Home was one of eight children, not all of whom survived infancy: his brother was the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13639/', "Sir Everard Home, first baronet")</script>; his sister Anne Home [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14215/', "Hunter, Anne")</script>], poet, married the anatomist John Hunter; and another sister, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1797), married the architect and engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19701/', "Robert Mylne")</script>.<br>
<br>At the age of twelve or thirteen Home stowed away to Newfoundland in order to avoid parental pressure to enter medicine. Put off the ship eighteen months later, he returned with a badly disabled left arm, which, when treated by John Hunter, was immobilized across his chest and ossified in that position. Reunited with his family, who were by then settled at Pall Mall in London, Home developed an aptitude for anatomical drawing with instruction from John Hunter. He received encouragement from Angelica Kauffmann and entered the Royal Academy Schools on 14 February 1769. He first exhibited there in 1770, contributing twenty-three paintings intermittently until 1813. In 1773 Home departed for Rome, visiting Paris and Florence <i>en route</i>, and remained there until August 1777. He met the artists William Miller and Thomas Jones, undertook small commissions, and made studies of antiquities, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
<br>Having tried, unsuccessfully, to establish a practice in London, Home moved, in 1780, to Dublin under the patronage of Lord Lifford the Irish chancellor. There he exhibited twenty-two paintings at the Artists' Exhibition in 1780, and, in 1782, undertook eight portraits, at 35 guineas each, for Trinity College theatre, including copies of portraits of Elizabeth I and Dean Swift, and Henry Grattan from life. Home married Suzanna (<i>d</i>. 1790), daughter of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7441/', "Solomon Delane")</script> on 8 September 1783. They had one daughter, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1829), and between three and five sons. With the arrival of a rival portrait painter, Gilbert Stuart, in Dublin, and Suzanna's failing health, Home returned to London in 1789.<br>
<br>Suzanna died in London in 1790, and Home left for India, where he had connections. Leaving his children with relatives, he departed without permission from the East India Company, reaching Madras in January 1791. There he met the artists John Smart and William Hickey, and found work painting theatrical scenery. Having sought and secured permission to accompany the grand army to Bangalore during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, Home reached the troops on 5 March. He remained with them until early April 1792, sketching captured forts, officers, and the local countryside (examples are in V&amp;A). He was present at, and later painted, the handing over of the hostage princes to Lord Cornwallis (<span class="italic">Lord Cornwallis Receiving the Sons of Sultan Tipu as Hostages</span> 1794&#150;5, exh. RA, 1797; NAM).<br>
<br>Home's contact with the British military proved enduring and lucrative. Within six months of returning to Madras, a subscription was raised and Home was commissioned to paint the death of Colonel Joseph Moorhouse (<span class="italic">The Death of Colonel Moorhouse at the Storming of the Pettah Gate of Bangalore, 7 March 1791</span>, 1793&#150;4, exh. RA, 1797, engraved by E. Stalker, 1811, NAM) and several notable portraits including <span class="italic">Charles, Second Earl Cornwallis</span> (1792; Banqueting Hall, Madras). Home's style combined careful drawing with simplicity and dignity, and his intimate knowledge of Indian topography enlivened his large-scale paintings with local detail and colour. After travelling with the artists Thomas and William Daniell he depicted a number of local monuments, including <span class="italic">Sculptured rocks: penance of Arjuna, Mahabalipuram</span> and <span class="italic">Dharmaraja Rath, Mahabalipuram</span> (both 1793; Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta). Twenty-nine of his earlier sketches were engraved and published, with written descriptions, as <span class="italic">Selected views of Mysore, the country of Tippoo Sultan</span> (1794) and <span class="italic">A Description of Seringapatam</span> (1796), containing six coloured aquatints.<br>
<br>Home sailed for Calcutta on 28 May 1795, and arrived on 4 June. On 17 September he married (Anna) Alicia Patterson (<i>d</i>. 1817), sister-in-law to his close friend James Colvin, and was later joined by his daughter and sons. In 1797 he was elected a member of the Asiatic Society, and secretary from 6 March 1802 to April 1804. His practice flourished, William Baille writing to Ozias Humphry in 1795 that Home was &#145;much employed, and has handsome prices&#146;  (MS, RA archive, London). Home's accounts ledger, June 1795&#150;August 1814 (NPG archive), lists eight portraits of Richard, first Marquess Wellesley, when governor-general and fourteen of his brother Sir Arthur Wellesley (later first duke of Wellington), begun between September 1804 and August 1806. Examples are at Aspley House, London; Stratfield Saye, Hampshire; the Royal Collection; and the National Portrait Gallery, London. Other significant subjects were <span class="italic">Lord Lake and his Son on Horseback</span> (1805; Victoria Memorial, Calcutta), <span class="italic">Gilbert Elliot, Lord Minto</span> (1811&#150;12; Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi, and 1812; Victoria Memorial).<br>
<br>Home's prosperity was due to his willingness to accept commissions large and small. He repaired paintings for Wellesley's rebuilt Government House in 1803, although a group of ceiling paintings was not completed. He also recorded indigenous mammals, birds, and reptiles. Two volumes of watercolours are at Victoria Memorial Hall, Calcutta, and <span class="italic">A White Leopard</span> (1805) is in the Royal Collection. In 1814 Home moved to Lucknow as historical and portrait painter at the court of Oudh, where his son John was equerry and European aide-de-camp, 1820&#150;25. He received 5000 sicca rupees per annum, and was also responsible for designing and superintending the making of carriages and other court attributes. Bishop Heber, visiting Lucknow in 1824, noted that:<blockquote>Mr. Home would have been a distinguished painter had he remained in Europe, for he had a great deal of taste and his drawing is very good and rapid; but it has been of course a great disadvantage to him to have only his own work to study, and he probably finds it necessary to paint in glowing colours to satisfy his Royal masters. (Heber, 1.395)</blockquote>Alicia Patterson died in 1817, and in 1825 Home resigned and moved to Cawnpore with his daughter and granddaughter, Jean. Home died in Cawnpore on 12 September 1834 and was buried there at Cutcherry cemetery. On 5 November 1834, Home's sons presented their father's collection of paintings to the Asiatic Society.<br>
