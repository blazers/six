<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rosenthal,  Joseph</span>  (1864&#150;1946), <span class="occ">cameraman and film director</span>, was born on 7 April 1864 in the Jewish East End of London, the son of Davis Rosenthal, a shoe salesman, and his wife, Mary Lippmann. Joseph began his career as a pharmaceutical chemist at St George's Hospital, before joining in 1896 the early film company Maguire and Baucus, for whom his sister Alice already worked. The company was managed by Charles Urban, an American-born entrepreneur who was to become one of the leading producers in the early British film industry. When Urban formed the Warwick Trading Company two years later, Rosenthal was given filming assignments first in Britain and Europe, and then as far afield as South Africa.<br>
<br>In 1899 Rosenthal was sent to South Africa again to cover the South African War, which broke out in October, an assignment that was to make his reputation. On arriving in January 1900, he initially went to the Natal front, before joining the rising star of General Roberts's column, pushing north from the Cape. Travelling with two mules and a cape cart, he could move relatively fast, and sometimes even went ahead of the troops. He filmed several scenes around Bloemfontein, though these and other films were lost when the ship carrying them back to Britain sank. However, several other films he had shot arrived safely. These showed such scenes as British troops on the march and escorting Boer prisoners, and they were of great interest to audiences throughout the empire and elsewhere. Camerawork could be a risky business: in filming the Vet River crossing, Rosenthal recalled that &#145;a shell exploded right in front of me, and it was very lucky indeed that I was not hit&#146;  (&#145;Peace in war&#146;, 292). He was present at the various British victories that came in the second quarter of 1900, and managed to film the surrender at Kroonstad in May, and the raising of the British flag over Pretoria the following month. To most people this seemed to be the end of the war, and Rosenthal departed.<br>
<br>Rosenthal's next assignment that year took him to the Far East: having left London in August, he arrived too late to film any action in the Boxer uprising, but managed to record some incidents in the Philippine-American War. From 1901 he was in safer surroundings: first he filmed the opening of the Australian parliament by the duke and duchess of Cornwall and York in May, and then in 1902 made a variety of films for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and what may have been his first venture into drama with a version of <span class="italic">Hiawatha</span> enacted by the Ojibwa people. But Rosenthal returned to the battlefield in 1904, when he was sent to cover the Russo-Japanese War, some of which he had to film from behind the protection of a special camera shield. His films of the gruelling siege of Port Arthur were shown throughout the world.<br>
<br>After the war ended Rosenthal stayed in the Far East and Borneo for some time, before proceeding to India to film the tour of the prince and princess of Wales at the end of 1905. But at this point in his career he was dismissed by Charles Urban, and in 1908 set up his own company, Rosie Films, based in Croydon. He tried his hand at comedy directing at this time, but it was no great success. <span class="italic">Father Buys an Armchair</span> (1909), for example, was a cinematically uninspired short, acted in exaggerated style. Rosenthal continued shooting documentary films for the rest of a career which lasted through the First World War. He later fell on hard times, and died (of bronchitis) on 5 March 1946, at 7 Lyndhurst Road, Peckham, London, at the age of eighty-one.<br>
<br>Rosenthal, known to his friends as Joe or Rosie, was a popular and colourful character, with an eye for the ladies and a tendency to swear like a trooper. In contrast to many of the amateur film camera operators who surfaced briefly at the turn of the century&#151;assorted anthropologists, missionaries, and war correspondents&#151;Joseph Rosenthal was one of the first truly professional cameramen, and made a whole career of it. This kind of professionalism would be much valued in the film industry in the years ahead.<br>
