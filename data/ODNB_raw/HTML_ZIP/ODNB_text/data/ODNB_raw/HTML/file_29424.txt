<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Henry</span>  (1610&#150;1675), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born on 4 March 1610 at Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, the son of Henry Wilkinson (1566&#150;1647) and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Arthur Wake of Salcey Forest, Northamptonshire, and sister of the diplomat <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28407/', "Sir Isaac Wake")</script>. The elder Henry Wilkinson, born in Halifax, matriculated in 1582 at Queen's College, Oxford, graduated BA in 1585, was elected fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1586, and proceeded MA in 1590 and BD in 1597. From 1601 until his death on 19 March 1647 he was rector of Waddesdon. He published <span class="italic">A Catechism</span> (which went through four editions between 1623 and 1637) and <span class="italic">The Debt Book</span> (1625) and was a member of the Westminster assembly from 1643. The younger Henry Wilkinson was one of a family of six sons and three daughters. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, aged twelve, on 14 February 1623, graduating BA on 25 November 1626, and proceeding MA on 11 June 1629 and BD on 16 November 1638.<br>
<br>Wilkinson preached in and about Oxford, but, because of his outspoken puritanism, at first the bishop of Oxford refused to ordain him. In his <span class="italic">Sermon Against Lukewarmness in Religion</span>, preached at St Mary's on 6 September 1640, Wilkinson challenged hearers to be zealous in their faith, condemned superficial and formalistic worship, and proclaimed the Scots' taking of Newcastle to be God's judgment upon England's empty religiosity. For this he was suspended from his divinity lectureship at Magdalen Hall and all priestly functions in the university until he should recant. He appealed to the Long Parliament, which restored him on 23 December 1640 and ordered the sermon to be printed. Wilkinson moved to London, was appointed minister of St Faith's under St Paul's in August 1644, chosen as a member of the Westminster assembly, and on 29 August 1645 became rector of St Dunstan-in-the-West. On three occasions he preached official sermons before parliament and had them published. There was a touch of irony in his last one: <span class="italic">Miranda stupenda</span> was delivered on 6 July 1646 in thanksgiving for the fall of Oxford to the army.<br>
<br>In 1646 parliament dispatched Wilkinson to Oxford, where he was chosen senior fellow of Magdalen and deputed a parliamentary visitor. The next year he signed &#145;A testimony to &hellip; the solemn league and covenant&#146;. On Dr Thomas Iles's expulsion, parliament appointed him, on 1 March 1648, canon of Christ Church, Oxford, where he was installed on 12 April. When the medieval stained glass was taken out of the cathedral windows, Anthony Wood records, Wilkinson &#145;stampt upon many parts of [it] and utterly defaced them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 530). Wilkinson was created DD on 24 July 1649 and elected Lady Margaret professor of divinity in the place of his fellow visitor, Francis Cheynell, on 12 July 1652. In 1654 he was an assistant to the commission for ejecting scandalous ministers in Oxfordshire. By then he had married Lady Vere Ker (or Carr), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15457/', "Robert Ker, first earl of Ancram")</script>, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby. They had four children. He was known at Oxford as Long Harry or Senior to distinguish him from Henry Wilkinson (1616/17&#150;1690), the principal of Magdalen Hall.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, though his predecessor was dead, Wilkinson's petition for royal confirmation of his prebendary failed. After ejection as canon in favour of Jasper Mayne (27 July 1660) and as professor in favour of Thomas Barlow (1 September), Wilkinson preached at All Hallows, Lombard Street, London, then at Clapham, Surrey, where he occupied a large house of fourteen hearths. A conventicle of sixty or more persons to whom he was preaching was broken up at Camberwell in August 1665, and some of his congregation were arrested. On 2 April 1675 Wilkinson took out a licence under Charles II's declaration of indulgence for either his house or the schoolhouse at Clapham to be used as a presbyterian meeting-house.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was a renowned preacher; three of his sermons were published after he delivered them at Cripplegate and Southwark in Samuel Annesley's popular <span class="italic">Morning Exercises</span> (1661 and 1674). When he died on 5 June 1675, either at Deptford or Putney, hundreds of people attended his funeral at Drapers' Hall and his burial in St Dunstan-in-the-West Church. Wilkinson was survived by his wife, one son, Robert, and two daughters, Ann and Elizabeth. His will, made at Clapham on 2 April 1675 and proved on 1 July, showed that he still owned a leasehold in Oxford and was able to leave &pound;600 to each of his daughters. He should not be confused with the Roman Catholic apologist Henry Wilkinson of the same period who published <span class="italic">Meditation upon the Marks of the True Christ</span> (1655).<br>
