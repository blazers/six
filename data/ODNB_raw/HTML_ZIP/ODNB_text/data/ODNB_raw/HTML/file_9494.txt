<span class="headword">Fisher,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1722, <em>d.</em> in or before 1782), <span class="occ">mezzotint engraver</span>, was the son of Mary Lambe and Charles Fisher (<i>d</i>. 1752). He was baptized on 18 November 1722 at St John's Church, Dublin. In the year preceding Edward's birth, his father, Charles, following in his own father's footsteps, was appointed master of the Feltmakers' Company. This may explain why it has sometimes been assumed that Edward started his career as a hatter, but the records of the Feltmakers' Company show no record of this. Fisher arrived in London in 1758 and spent some time in the studio of James McArdell. Shortly after that date his talent in mezzotint was recognized by Joshua Reynolds, who selected Fisher to engrave his portrait <span class="italic">Commodore Augustus Keppel</span> in 1759. Reynolds recognized how closely his fortunes were linked to the wide dissemination of prints after his work, and it was essential he choose a skilled and sympathetic engraver to ensure the print's popularity.<br>
<br>After the success of <span class="italic">Commodore Augustus Keppel</span>, Fisher engraved nearly thirty more of Reynolds's paintings including <span class="italic">Lady Sarah Bunbury Sacrificing to the Graces</span> (1766) and <span class="italic">Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy</span> (1762). Fisher was favoured for his technical skill, his bold modelling, and his accuracy; indeed, Northcote (1818) recounts how Reynolds once criticized Fisher for being &#145;injudiciously exact&#146;  (Lennox-Boyd and others, 144). Fisher was important to Reynolds's portrait print business, as the painter's pocket book records. Alongside the entry for the novelist Laurence Sterne's final sitting in April 1760 can be found the words &#145;Mr Fisher Engraver&#146;, indicating that the portrait should be sent immediately to the engraver. From successive entries in Reynolds's pocket book it is known that it took Fisher five weeks to complete this subtle and effective mezzotint. Additionally, from a reference in one of David Garrick's letters it appears that Fisher would also have been responsible for selling on prints after Reynolds, as those of Garrick were available directly from the engraver who &#145;Lives in Leicester Fields&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.343).<br>
<br>Fisher was a member of the Society of Artists and throughout the 1760s and 1770s regularly showed engraved portraits after painters such as Benjamin West, Nathaniel Dance, and Francis Cotes at their exhibitions.<br>
<br>Although the circumstances are unknown, Edward Fisher died before 13 July 1782. After that date his surviving plates were dispersed by his widow, who may have been called Anne. It is said that many were then tampered with to produce false proofs.<br>
