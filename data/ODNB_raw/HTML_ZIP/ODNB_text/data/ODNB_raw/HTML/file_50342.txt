<span class="headword">Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1182), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was the son of Norman parents who had settled near Le Bec-Hellouin, and the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27168/', "Theobald")</script>, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1161). He joined Theobald's household and was shortly appointed archdeacon of Canterbury. Walter seems to have been an active administrator. He appears as addressee or witness to more than a dozen archiepiscopal charters, and he was responsible for imposing a tax called &#145;second aids&#146; on the churches of the diocese. This supplement, however, was later thought to have been excessive and was abolished by Theobald.<br>
<br>Bishop Ascelin of Rochester died on 24 January 1148, and Walter was elected <i>ex more</i> by the cathedral priory monks in the chapter house at Canterbury three days later. He owed his position to his brother, and Theobald later named him an executor of his will. Once elected Walter did homage and fealty to Theobald and swore to defend the rights of Canterbury in the diocese of Rochester. On 14 March 1148 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester by Theobald, and made his profession of obedience. In his household can be found the usual chaplains and chamberlains, clerks, and stewards, as well as a group of men educated in the schools. From 1148 to 1176 he assisted with the consecration of twelve bishops and archbishops, and in April 1161, when the primate was ill, Walter himself consecrated Richard Peche to Coventry. After Theobald's death in the same year, Walter took charge of the spiritual affairs at Canterbury and consecrated Bartholomew to Exeter. His name appears fairly often among the witnesses to Theobald's charters, and he also confirmed grants to a number of religious houses, and acted with the archbishop in the settlement of judicial cases. A dispute with his own archdeacon, Paris, over the share of income from ecclesiastical pleas, was decided in favour of the bishop. A quarrel with his monks over a church that Walter had given to Roger, his kinsman (<i>nepos</i>), involved appeals to Rome by both sides before a satisfactory agreement was reached. In the end the bishop increased his donations to the poor and obit payments to the convent, and presented the monks with a gold cup and cloth, and a silk pall.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Walter appears to have been a faithful royal servant. In obedience to Stephen he did not attend the papal council at Rheims in 1148 and was suspended by Eugenius III. In 1153 he was among the bishops who witnessed the treaty between Stephen and Duke Henry, and he was present at the latter's coronation in December 1154. He was again in London in October 1163 for the translation of Edward the Confessor, and he can be found at several other royal councils, including Henry II's settlement of the Castile&#150;Navarre controversy in 1177. In the Becket conflict Walter had only a modest role. He has been described in this context as &#145;a colourless personality&#146;  (Knowles, <span class="italic">Thomas Becket</span>, 66), an assessment that may reveal ignorance of his character rather than facts about it, though it probably reflects his caution with regard to the king. In June 1162 Walter, who had been acting as <i>vicarius</i> of Canterbury since Theobald's death, ordained Becket to the priesthood. The right of consecration, however, he was forced to cede to Henry of Winchester. Gervase obscures the reasons, but emphasizes Walter's noble character and piety.<br>
<br>Previously Walter had befriended Becket on two occasions when he was briefly forced out of Theobald's household; he acted on his behalf to demand a safe conduct after the Council of Northampton; he excused himself from the London council in 1169 called by Henry to resist the archbishop; and he was ready to welcome him to Rochester upon his return to England in 1170. On the other hand, Gilbert Foliot, in his defence of the bishops at Clarendon, says that Walter did not join them to oppose the king. Perhaps fearful of the consequences of Foliot's excommunication, Walter remained away from Rochester in the spring of 1169. In the greater crisis of June 1170, against a papal injunction, Walter joined his colleagues at the coronation of the Young King, Henry, and was suspended by Alexander III. John of Salisbury had earlier written to reproach Walter for failing to act decisively on Becket's behalf and scolded him for personal extravagance but public parsimony. Rather later Peter of Blois chided him for his love of hunting, which did not suit a bishop, especially one who was eighty years old. He was accused of neglecting his pastoral duties and a complaint had been made in Rome. Walter, it seems, like most bishops, carried the burden of the ecclesiastical order without complaint, but aspired neither to reform nor to sainthood. He died on 26 July 1182.<br>
