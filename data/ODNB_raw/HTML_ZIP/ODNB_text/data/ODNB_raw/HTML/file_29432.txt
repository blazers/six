<span class="headword">Wilks,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1793&#150;1846), <span class="occ">swindler</span>, was the only son (there were three daughters) of <a name="cosubject_29433"></a><span class="headword">John Wilks</span>  (1776?&#150;1854) and his wife, Isabella (1777?&#150;1846). John Wilks senior, <span class="occ">attorney and politician</span>, was the son of Matthew Wilks (<i>d</i>. 1829), minister at Whitefield's Tabernacle in Moorfields. He was an attorney at 41 Hoxton Square (1804&#150;13) and at 18 Finsbury Place (1813&#150;28). As secretary of the Protestant Society for the Protection of Religious Liberty he corresponded in 1811&#150;20 with Perceval and Liverpool about relieving dissenters from such penal legislation as the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. He sat as radical MP for Boston (1830&#150;37) and contested St Albans (1847). He was a Middlesex magistrate and a fellow of learned societies. He died, after vomiting blood for three hours, on 25 August 1854 at his home, 3 Finsbury Square, London, and was buried at Kensal Green.<br>
<br>Wilks junior was the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in 1818 and had such little success in his father's profession of attorney that he sought popularity as author of <span class="italic">A Christian Biographical Dictionary</span> (1821), <span class="italic">Memoirs of Queen Caroline</span> (1822), and <span class="italic">Bianca</span> (1823). In 1822 he attempted to float a joint-stock company to enforce Tudor laws on sabbath observance; its prospectus contained &#145;a good deal of cant, and rigmarole, and lamentation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Sept 1826). In 1824&#150;5 he promoted joint-stock companies interested in mining, gas lighting, railways, Paddington stages, and a fishmarket. He inveigled noblemen and parliamentarians onto the boards of these companies, including Viscount Palmerston, who wrote of him: &#145;a bit of a rogue if Nature writes a legible hand; at the same time he is a clever fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 175). Wilks, who married before 1826, kept a sumptuous house at 36 New Broad Street, a mansion at Mill Hill, and a summer establishment at Ramsgate; travelling from Mill Hill in his carriage and four, preceded by outriders, he ran the lord chief justice off the road. His reputation was destroyed in 1826 when his swindling of the Welch Iron and Coal Mining Company was publicized, and he became notorious as Bubble Wilks. Having ruined thousands of investors, he was much involved in litigation, and besieged by sheriffs' officers for debts. In order to protect himself with parliamentary privilege from imprisonment, and as the candidate of religious liberty, he was elected in June 1826 as MP for Sudbury, but bilked paying promised expenses. His fraudulent manipulation of the Devon and Cornwall Mining Company (formed to exploit properties owned by the duke of Cleveland) was debated in the House of Commons on 9 April 1827. He had become vestry clerk of St Luke's Church, either at Finsbury or Chelsea, but in 1827 the parish began proceedings to recover over &pound;5000 which had vanished. He resigned his parliamentary seat in April 1828 shortly before being charged with forgery in a different transaction. Following his acquittal on the non-appearance of the prosecutor, his family offered him an annuity on condition that he live abroad, and he became Paris correspondent of <span class="italic">The Standard</span>. His deceitful rumour-mongering on the bourse almost resulted in his expulsion from France on police orders; he was banned from the bourse's precincts. His next projects&#151;the <span class="italic">London and Paris Courier</span>, <span class="italic">La Revue Protestante</span>, and the Paris Parcels Delivery Company&#151;were all as unsuccessful as he was hypocritical. Supposedly he settled at Chiswick about 1840 and edited the <span class="italic">Church and State Gazette</span>. His three-volume novel <span class="italic">The Tory Baronet, or, Tories, Whigs and Radicals, by One who Knows Them</span> was published in London in 1841. He cheated many young men with a bogus clerical register office shortly before his death of swollen tonsils, after a severe illness of only four hours, on 24 January 1846 at 24 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.<br>
