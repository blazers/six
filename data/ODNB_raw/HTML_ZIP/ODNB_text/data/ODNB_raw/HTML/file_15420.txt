<span class="headword">Kent,  Nathaniel</span>  (1737&#150;1810), <span class="occ">land agent and writer on agriculture</span>, was the younger son of Ambrose Kent of Penton Mewsey, Hampshire. In 1755 he began work as a clerk at Portsmouth Dockyard, and later he held a secretarial post on the staff of Admiral Geary, at Portsmouth. From 1762 to 1765 he was in Brussels as secretary to Sir James Porter, minister-plenipotentiary, and while there he studied Flemish farming methods. On his return to England in 1766, he was asked by Sir John Cust, speaker of the House of Commons, to write an account of farming in the Austrian Netherlands, and he was encouraged by Cust and Thomas Anson, MP for Lichfield, to leave the diplomatic service and became an agricultural adviser. He became manager of Anson's property in Norfolk. Soon afterwards he met Benjamin Stillingfleet, the naturalist.<br>
<br>In 1775 Kent published <span class="italic">Hints to Gentlemen of Landed Property</span>. This was one of the first works to set out detailed plans for model cottages. It also advised landowners to drain their land, and recommended enclosure, favouring either the Flemish eight-course system of crop rotation or the Norfolk six-course system. This work made him famous, and by 1793 he had a land agency in London at Craig's Court, Charing Cross, in partnership with John Claridge and William Pearce; the firm carried out land and rent valuations, and acted as an estate agency. From 1791 Kent managed the royal estates at Windsor Great Park and Richmond Park, and by 1797 he had converted 1400 acres of parkland at Windsor into two farms, one run on the Flemish system and the other on the Norfolk one.<br>
<br>Kent was asked to write a report on Norfolk for the board of agriculture in 1796. His later writings included <span class="italic">The Great Advantage of a Cow to the Family of a Labouring Man</span> (1797), and <span class="italic">An Account of the Improvements made on the Farm in the Great Park of His Majesty the King at Windsor</span> (1799).<br>
<br>In 1808 Thomas Coke of Holkham, president of the Norfolk Agricultural Society, presented Kent with a silver goblet in recognition of his services to agriculture. Kent contributed to the progress of the &#145;agricultural revolution&#146; by making improvements while managing large estates.<br>
<br>Kent is known to have had a wife called Armine, but nothing else is known about his family life. He died of apoplexy at Fulham, Middlesex, on 10 October 1810.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_15420"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Kent</span>  (1708&#150;1766), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was born on 17 April 1708 at Weedon, Northamptonshire, but his parentage is unknown. He was a king's scholar at Eton College and went to King's College, Cambridge in 1725 as a scholar. He was awarded a BA in 1729, an MA in 1733, and became a fellow of King's College. He was ordained in 1731 and was a priest at Ely from 1732. In 1744 he became insane, but he recovered and by 1748 was headmaster of Wisbech School. Later he became curate of Kersey in Suffolk. While at Cambridge, Kent published an edition of Lucian, <span class="italic">Excerpta quaedam ex Luciani Samosatensis operibus, in usum Tyronum</span> (1730). Latin notes and a Latin version accompanied the text, and the work was reprinted several times in London. Kent died in 1766.<br>
