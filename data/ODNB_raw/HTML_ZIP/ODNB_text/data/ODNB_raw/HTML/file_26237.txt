<span class="headword">Stanford,  Charles</span>  (1823&#150;1886), <span class="occ">Baptist minister</span>, was the only son of Joseph Stanford (<i>d</i>. 1862), a shoemaker. He was born at Northampton on 9 March 1823; he had a sister who died in childhood. He was for some time a shoemaker, then a lawyer's clerk, and afterwards a bookseller's assistant. Through the liberality of his employer, a Mr Phillips, he received some education. He and his parents joined the Independent Doddridge Chapel in 1839, but Charles went a step further and was baptized at Greyfriars' Chapel at about the same time, while continuing in membership at Doddridge Chapel. A Sunday school teacher and chapel librarian, he preached with such success that he was recommended to the Baptist college at Bristol, which he attended from 1841 to 1844.<br>
<br>Stanford's first pastorate was at Sparrow Hill, Loughborough, where he stayed from 1845 until Christmas 1846. In 1847 he became minister of the United Presbyterian and Baptist church at Devizes. Under his ministry the congregation gradually increased, and a new chapel was opened on an adjacent site in 1852 as a solely Baptist foundation. In May 1858 he was invited to become co-pastor, with Dr Edward Steane, of Denmark Place Chapel, Camberwell, London. Steane suffered a serious breakdown in health, and from 1861 Stanford was sole pastor. There, in addition to his church duties, he was an active missionary to the surrounding neighbourhood. He remained at Camberwell until his death. He was on the committee of the Baptist Missionary Society in 1863&#150;6, and remained an enthusiastic advocate of missions throughout his life. From 1866 he was a virtual invalid and made only occasional forays from his pulpit into the wider Baptist world. In 1881 he was vice-president, and in 1882 president, of the London Baptist Association, despite being nearly blinded by glaucoma.<br>
<br>Stanford published many sermons and addresses. His two best-known works are <span class="italic">Joseph Alleine, his Companions and Times: a Memorial of Black Bartholomew</span> (1861), his contribution to the bicentenary of the Ejection of 1662; and <span class="italic">Philip Doddridge</span> (1880), in the series <span class="roman">Men Worth Remembering</span>.<br>
<br>Stanford was twice married: first, in June 1847, to Jane Johnson, who died in 1849, and second, in 1854, to Jane Kingdon, elder daughter of Paul Anstie. He had no surviving children. Having suffered all his life from asthma and angina, he died after a brief illness at his home, 26 De Crespigny Park, Denmark Hill, on 18 March 1886, and was buried in Norwood cemetery on the 24th.<br>
