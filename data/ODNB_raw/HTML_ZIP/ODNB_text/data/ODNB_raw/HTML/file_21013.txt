<span class="headword">Owen,  John</span> <span class="st"> [Joannes Audoenus]</span>  (1563/4&#150;1622?), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was born at Plas-du, Llanarmon, Caernarvonshire, the third son of Thomas Owen of Plas-du (eldest son of Owen ap Gruffydd), and his wife, Jane Morris. John's uncle Hugh Owen was a leading recusant, involved in numerous treasonous plots, including support for the Spanish Armada. Thomas had some sympathy for his brother; he was himself indicted for recusancy in 1578, but thereafter conformed.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlypoetry"></a>Education and early poetry</h2>Owen was admitted a scholar at Winchester College at the age of thirteen, under Thomas Bilson, in 1577. Most of the figures he later addressed as friends in his works were from Winchester. Christopher Johnson, a distinguished Latin poet, had been headmaster shortly before Owen's time, and the school had established a thriving tradition of spoken and written Latin. Owen's verse first came to public notice while he was still at school, among poems celebrating the triumphant return of Drake in 1580; it was pinned to the mainmast of the <i>Golden Hind</i>, and was recorded and translated by Camden  (<span class="italic">Audoeni epigrammatum</span>, 2.39).<br>
<br>Owen proceeded to New College, Oxford, where he became a probationer fellow in 1582, and full fellow in 1584. The fellowships were restricted in subject, and Owen was obliged to study civil law to fill a vacancy as legist. He took the degree of BCL on 2 May 1590. His later sharpness against lawyers suggests that he resented the experience. Owen did, though, retain a patriotic fondness for Oxford: so, to illustrate the phrase &#145;hysteron&#150;proteron&#146; (&#145;reverse order&#146;)&#151;&#145;a presposterous way of speaking&#146;&#151;he writes, &#145;Exempli causa, Cant'brigia Oxonium&#146; (&#145;for example Cambridge before Oxford&#146;; <span class="italic">Audoeni epigrammatum</span>, 6.3).<br>
<br>Owen was the Joannes Oenus who contributed to the volume issued by New College in 1587 to commemorate Philip Sidney: <span class="italic">Peplus, illustrissimi viri D. Philippi Sidnaei supremis honoribus dicatus</span>. He wrote 64 lines, in eight separate elegiac poems: 6, 4, 20, 8, 2, 10, 2, and 12 lines respectively. In his later epigrams he was to avoid such prolixity: a poem of 20 lines is remarkably long by his standards. Owen's contribution is not dissimilar to others in that book: it was conventional to provide multiple poems for such collections (sometimes of varying length and metre, but most commonly in Latin elegiacs).<h2>
<a name="Careerasschoolmasterandprofessionalpoet"></a>Career as schoolmaster, and professional poet</h2>Owen left Oxford in 1591, and commenced his career as a schoolmaster. He first taught at a school in Trelleck, Monmouthshire. About 1594 or 1595 he was appointed headmaster of King Henry VIII's School at Warwick; this may have been on Bilson's recommendation. One of Owen's more distinguished pupils was Sir Thomas Puckering (1592&#150;1636); another was John Ley (1583&#150;1662), later subdean of Chester, a puritan divine, appointed president of Sion College in 1645. In a lawsuit of 1613 the headmaster (perhaps still Owen) was described as &#145;sufficiently painful and diligent&#146;  (Leach, 132).<br>
<br>At some point Owen seems to have moved to London and made a career as a professional poet, relying on the uncertain support of a number of patrons. His first three books of epigrams were printed in London by Simon Waterson in 1606. They were an immediate success at home and abroad, with two more editions of book 1 in 1607, as well as a fourth book; two further sets of three books followed in 1612, making a total of ten books. They were &#145;greedily bought, and taken into the hands of all ingenious scholars&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.321).<br>
<br>Owen was writing within a tradition of British epigram collections: for example, Sir John Davies's at the end of Christopher Marlowe's Ovid translations (before 1598), as well as John Davies of Hereford's <span class="italic">Scourge of Folly</span> (<i>c</i>.1612). Owen's New College friend Thomas Bastard produced <span class="italic">Chrestoleros</span> in seven books (1598). We also find Edward Guilpin's collection, <span class="italic">Skialetheia</span> (1598); John Weever's (1599); John Heath's <span class="italic">Two Centuries of Epigrams</span> (1610); and Sir John Harington's (1613). All these date from the period when Owen was composing and publishing; several of their authors also studied at Winchester. Ben Jonson set epigrams at the start of the lyric part of his poetry, arranged over the years 1612&#150;14. John Reinolds (or Reynolds) was another New College contemporary, with ambitious plans for the Latin epigram; James Martin (or Aretius) was also active in Oxford.<br>
<br>The tradition of Welsh Latin writing might also have inspired Owen; it included accomplished humanists such as S&icirc;on Dafydd Rhys. Sir John Stradling (1563&#150;1627) was of very similar age to Owen, and was a contemporary at Oxford. Four books of Stradling's Latin epigrams appeared in 1607, just as Owen was achieving notoriety, and Stradling praises the pleasure given by reading and rereading Owen. Owen himself is often conscious of his Welshness&#151;a well-known epigram puns on Welsh, Hebrew, and Greek words  (<span class="italic">Audoeni epigrammatum</span>, 9.67); he believes in British union, but rebukes a fellow countryman who has denied his origins. It has plausibly been suggested that his Latin style is influenced by the Welsh alliterative technique of <i>cynghanedd</i>, though much of his word play is a natural feature of the neo-Latin epigram. Puns and anagrams were loved in the Renaissance: an artful example is &#145;De fide. Anatramma quincuplex&#146; (&#145;On faith: fivefold anagram&#146;):<blockquote>
<div>Recta fides certa est, arcet mala schismata, non est<br>
</div>
<div>Sicut Creta fides, fictilis; arte caret.<br>
</div>(True faith is sure, it wards off evil schisms, is not false (like that of Crete), it lacks art. ibid., 6.12)</blockquote>Some of his attacks on Roman Catholicism pleased Owen's mostly protestant audience, but infuriated the recusant portion of his own family, most notoriously an epigram of 1612 on papal simony that questioned whether St Peter was at Rome&#151;though Simon undoubtedly was  (<span class="italic">Audoeni epigrammatum</span>, 5.8). Other anti-papal poems appeared earlier. Owen was placed on the &#145;Index librorum prohibitorum&#146; (list of books prohibited to Catholics), and, according to Wood, his uncle &#145;dashed his name out from his last will and testament; which was the chief reason, that he ever after lived in a poor condition&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.321). Wood discusses his appeal to readers:<blockquote>an ingenious liberty of joking &hellip; was, and is now with some, especially foreigners, not a little pleasing and delightful. But that which I must farther note of him is, that being always troubled with the disease that attends poets (indigence) he was received into the patronage of his country-man and kinsman, John Williams, bishop of Lincoln and lord-keeper of the great-seal. (ibid., 2.320)</blockquote>The loss of his inheritance was doubtless a shock, but Wood probably over-simplifies. It is far from certain that Owen's condition remained &#145;poor&#146;, though he may never have been as comfortable, or as sure of continuing patronage, as he would have wished.<br>
<br>A study of Owen's network of friends and patrons suggests that Owen was much involved in the London literary scene. The dedications of individual books indicate some of his chief patrons (at least those he wished to thank, or curry favour with, most publicly): the Neville sisters, daughters of the earl of Dorset; Lady Arabella Stuart; Henry, prince of Wales (in whose lifetime he received a pension); Charles, duke of York; Sir Edward Noel; Sir William Sidley (or Sedley); and Sir Roger Owen&#151;the last he calls his &#145;Three Maecenases&#146;. The learned Jane Owen of Oxford wrote a congratulatory poem to him, and received one in return.<br>
<br>Owen never married, and probably died in 1622, in London. He was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. John Williams placed a memorial brass there to him, with his effigy and six lines of Latin verse.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Camden links Owen's name with Sidney, Spenser, Daniel, Holland, Ben Jonson, Campion, Drayton, Chapman, Marston, Shakespeare, &#145;and other most pregnant wits of these our times whom succeeding ages may justly admire&#146;  (Poole-Wilson, 242). Ben Jonson disapproved, perhaps moved by professional jealousy at what he saw as Owen's undeserved success in London literary circles: &#145;Owen is a pure Pedantique Schoolmaster sweeping his living from the Posteriors of little children, and hath no thinge good in him, his Epigrammes being bare narration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, ed. C. H. Herford and P. Simpson, repr., 1965, 1.138). Archbishop William Sancroft left his commonplace book, containing hundreds of Latin epigrams, to Emmanuel College, Cambridge (MS 105): two-thirds of them are copied from Owen (compared to a few by neo-Latinists, or his contemporary James Alban Gibbes).<br>
<br>Within a century of his death Owen's work had been published throughout Europe, and had been translated not only into English&#151;including a translation by Robert Hayman (1628) prepared in &#145;Bristols-Hope in Britaniola, anciently called New-found-land&#146;&#151;but also into German, French, Spanish, and Danish. It was Owen, not Shakespeare, whom seventeenth-century Europeans knew and admired. Continental editions of Owen outnumber the English by a ratio of over three to one. Poole-Wilson has identified forty-five continental editions of Owen's Latin text before 1800. Nine appeared by 1622, the first at Amberg in 1608; Owen's book dedicated to Arabella Stuart was published at Die, in France, in 1613. There were at least thirty-seven separate editions in the seventeenth century, at least twelve of them published at Amsterdam (starting in 1624), from the distinguished presses of Jansson, Blaeu, Elzevier, and Hack.<br>
<br>Owen's influence in Germany was particularly strong; Heine's schoolmaster read little else. Bernhard Nicaeus translated 623 epigrams into German (both Low and High), published as <span class="italic">Rosarium, dat is, Rosen-Garten</span> (1638 and 1641); Valentin L&ouml;ber produced another version (1651, 1653, and 1661), and so did J. P. Titz, along with a school of Owen's German imitators. More surprisingly, perhaps, was Owen's popularity in staunchly Catholic Spain, generally hostile to British literary culture. Francisco de la Torre cooked up a rare translation in two volumes, <span class="italic">Agudezas de Ivan Oven</span> (1674, 1682): the survival of two distinct issues from 1674 may indicate that it was immediately pirated. Erich Herlov put him into Danish: <span class="italic">Den ber&oslash;mmelige engelske poetis Johannes Oveni &hellip; tre f&oslash;rste b&oslash;gger</span> (1726). Ludwig Holberg observed that copies of Owen were in everyone's hands early in the eighteenth century, and were not infrequently used as school textbooks  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.320).<br>
<br>Le Brun's French version of Owen was published in Paris (1709), and reprinted as <span class="italic">Les &eacute;pigrammes d'Owen traduites en vers Fran&ccedil;ois</span> (1719), with Latin and French on facing pages. Owen satisfied the French sense of wit throughout the eighteenth century: there was a call for Owen's works both in the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> (where they fit a world of cutting sarcasm and <i>liaisons dangereuses</i>), and in the heat of the revolution, when Renouard's scholarly edition of 1794 was published.<br>
<br>Modern scholarship has often been unkind, and Owen's epigrams are summarily dismissed. More recently, however, with rising interest in neo-Latin, scholars have begun to take him seriously again, and have attempted to set him fairly in context.<br>
