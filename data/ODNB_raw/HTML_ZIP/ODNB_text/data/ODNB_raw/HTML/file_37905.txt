<span class="headword">Robinson,  John George</span>  (1856&#150;1943), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born on 30 July 1856 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the younger son and second of three children of Matthew Robinson, divisional locomotive, carriage, and wagon superintendent of the Great Western Railway (GWR), and his wife, Jane Armstrong. His elder brother, James Armstrong Robinson, became works manager and divisional locomotive superintendent of the GWR at Wolverhampton. John was educated at Chester grammar school and in 1872 became a pupil of Joseph Armstrong, locomotive superintendent of the GWR. He trained at the Swindon works. In 1878 he became assistant to his father in Bristol. He was appointed in 1884 assistant locomotive, carriage, and wagon superintendent of the Waterford, Limerick, and Western Railway of Ireland, and became superintendent in the following year. He introduced several new locomotive types on this Irish cross-country railway.<br>
<br>In 1900 Robinson was appointed locomotive and marine superintendent of the Great Central and two years later also took control of the carriage and wagon department, with the title of chief mechanical engineer. The Great Central, formerly a cross-country line, was the last main-line railway to enter London in 1899, and within two years Robinson had introduced new and more powerful locomotives for this service. In the following twenty years he was responsible for the design and building of many new types of main-line and suburban passenger and freight locomotives of large dimensions, which gave excellent service and whose elegance and symmetry of outline were greatly admired. At least as important was the unusual sturdiness of construction which contributed to the remarkable longevity of several classes, especially the 2&#150;8&#150;0 freight design.<br>
<br>In 1910 carriage building was transferred from the locomotive works at Gorton, Manchester, to a new works at Dukinfield, where main-line and suburban carriages (which were among the most comfortable in Britain) were produced and from 1915 onwards fitted with Robinson's anti-telescoping fenders, which gave improved protection from accidents. Robinson also sponsored a new and widely used design of locomotive superheater and an automatic train-stop system to prevent overrunning of signals, and carried out extensive trials with locomotives burning oil and pulverized coal with a view to reducing fuel costs.<br>
<br>During the First World War Robinson was a member of the railway workshops manufacturing committee. He was responsible for producing large numbers of gun carriages and mountings at Gorton and for the design and building of ambulance trains at Dukinfield for overseas and home service. In 1917 his 8K class 2&#150;8&#150;0 locomotive design was ordered in large numbers&#151;over 500 were built&#151;for military supply and troop-train service in France. After the war large numbers were purchased by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), GWR, and London, Midland, and Scottish Railway (LMS), while others went to railways in China and Australia. In the Second World War ninety-two were sent for service with the railways of Persia (Iran) carrying supplies to the USSR.<br>
<br>Robinson was an able engineer and administrator who took a keen interest in his men and their working conditions, especially those of locomotive footplate staff, whose spartan conditions he improved considerably. In 1922, prior to the incorporation of the Great Central into the LNER group, he was sounded out as to whether he would undertake the post of chief mechanical engineer. However, he preferred to retire and recommended H. Nigel Gresley of the Great Northern, who was twenty years younger. Robinson was appointed CBE in 1920. He was a member of the institutions of Civil (1902) and Mechanical (1891) Engineers.<br>
<br>In 1884 Robinson married Mary Ann (1858&#150;1938), daughter of Richard Hillyard Dalton, a mining engineer of Helston, Cornwall. They had three daughters and one son, Matthew, who followed his father's profession and was for many years superintendent of the LNER locomotive depot at Neasden, London. Robinson died at his home, Koyama, West Cliff Road, Bournemouth, on 7 December 1943. After a funeral service at St Michael's Church, Bournemouth, his cremated remains were buried at Bournemouth north cemetery on 11 December.<br>
