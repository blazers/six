<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davis,  Arthur Joseph</span>  (1878&#150;1951), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 21 May 1878 at 25 Leinster Square, London, one of the four gifted sons of Montague Davis (<i>d</i>. in or before 1923), a merchant, and Ada, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moss. His father and mother, both of Jewish descent, were of Canadian and Australian origin respectively. The family moved to Brussels, where Arthur was educated privately from about 1888 to 1893, before going to Paris at the early age of sixteen to study architecture in the preparatory atelier of J.-A. Godefroy and J.-E. Freynet. In 1895 he entered the atelier at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts of Jean-Louis Pascal, winner of the Prix de Rome in 1866. Davis won the first-class prize in the <i>concours</i> of 1896 and entered the office of Charles Mew&egrave;s (1858&#150;1914) in 1898, assisting him in his competition designs for the Grand and Petit Palais at the Paris Exhibition of 1900.<br>
<br>Trained, like Davis, under Pascal, Mew&egrave;s combined the mastery of planning for which the Beaux-Arts was celebrated, with knowledge of French eighteenth-century interior design and decoration. Mew&egrave;s's brilliant creation of the Ritz Hotel in 1898&#150;1900, behind fa&ccedil;ades of the 1690s in the place Vend&ocirc;me, Paris, led C&eacute;sar Ritz to employ him and Davis in London: first, to design the Palm Court and restaurant of the Carlton Hotel, Haymarket (1898&#150;1901; dem.), and then to build the Ritz Hotel, Piccadilly (1903&#150;6). In 1898 Mew&egrave;s sent Davis to London to take charge of work on the Carlton Hotel at the astonishingly young age of twenty. The bursts of febrile creative activity of this youthful genius seem associated with his condition as a manic depressive. In 1898 he left the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts without graduating, partly because, as a British subject, he was debarred from entering for the Prix de Rome.<br>
<br>Having joined Mew&egrave;s's practice as junior English partner in 1900, Davis collaborated with him from 1902 on the design of the Ritz Hotel in London. As always, they worked so closely together that it is impossible, stylistically, to separate their respective contributions. Despite its Parisian arcade and high mansard roof, the Ritz is one of the first steel-framed structures in England, the steelwork made in Germany from designs by the Swedish engineer Sven Bylander, who had worked in Chicago, home of the skyscraper. Much of the internal decorative work in a sophisticated Louis XVI style was provided by French craftsmen, the finest being in the dining-room, which has been described as the most beautiful in Europe.<br>
<br>The elegant and light interiors of Mew&egrave;s and Davis's hotels led to the commissions for Inveresk House, designed as offices for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, in Aldwych (1906&#150;7; alt.), and for the Royal Automobile Club, Pall Mall (1908&#150;11), with a magnificent Pompeian swimming-bath. They also carried out much domestic work in both London and the country for the kind of wealthy patrons, often with South American or South African connections, who were welcomed at the court of Edward VII. One of the finest was their remodelling in a lavish French manner of Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire (1902&#150;4), for Julius Wernher, for whose first employer and subsequent friend Jules Porg&egrave;s Mew&egrave;s had built the ch&acirc;teau of Rochefort-en-Yvelines in 1898. In Surrey they remodelled Coombe Court for Lord de Grey, treasurer of the household to Queen Alexandra, and Polesden Lacey for Mrs Ronald Greville, the leading Edwardian hostess.<br>
<br>Albert Ballin, head of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, now decided to install Ritz-style restaurants in his fleet of luxury ships, then being built in Hamburg and Belfast. Mew&egrave;s and Davis thus worked on interiors in 1905&#150;6 for the <i>Amerika</i> and the <i>Kaiserin Auguste Victoria</i>. The revolution which they effected in the layout and decoration of liners, echoing what they had already done for hotels, led to Davis receiving the commission from the Cunard Line for the design of the <i>Aquitania</i> in 1913. With the Liverpool architects Willink and Thicknesse, Davis also designed the Cunard Building, Pierhead, Liverpool (1914&#150;16), a memorable contribution to the waterfront, recalling some massive Florentine palazzo.<br>
<br>Mew&egrave;s died suddenly, under surgery, in August 1914. After dealing with uncompleted projects in the office, Davis joined HM forces in April 1916, serving as a temporary second lieutenant attached to a hospital unit behind the French lines, until he was invalided out, with the rank of captain, with a severe breakdown in November 1917. After convalescence at Craiglockhart Hospital, he returned to practice, continuing the firm of Mew&egrave;s and Davis in partnership with Charles H. Gage.<br>
<br>In 1910 Mew&egrave;s and Davis had designed the first overseas branch bank for the Westminster Bank in Brussels, which led to commissions for banks in Antwerp, Nantes, and Valencia, and, after the war, to Davis's Threadneedle Street branch of the Westminster Bank in 1922 and London headquarters of the bank in Lothbury in 1925. Recalling Peruzzi's Palazzo Massimo, the former won him the RIBA London architecture bronze medal in 1930. It was followed by his Morgan Grenfell's Bank, Great Winchester Street (1925), and offices in Bishopsgate for the Hudson's Bay Company (1928&#150;9). He designed the exquisite interiors of the Cunard liners <i>Franconia</i> (1922) and <i>Laconia</i> (1923), as well as Cunard House, Leadenhall Street, London (1930; dem.).<br>
<br>An unexpected work was Davis's Armenian church of St Sarkis, Iverna Gardens, Kensington (1928), commissioned by Calouste Gulbenkian, for whom the partners had designed houses in both Paris and London. The design of St Sarkis was inspired by study of churches in Armenia, including that in the cloisters at Haghbat. On 1 November 1923 Davis married Rona Jean Duncan (1898/9&#150;1940), the daughter of Ernest Alfred Lee, a marine engineer; the couple had a daughter, Ann, and a son, Ronald. His friends included the architects Sir Edwin Lutyens, A. E. Richardson, Charles Reilly, Oliver Hill, and Herbert Austen Hall. His<blockquote>long residence in Paris had given him a perfect command of the French language, and this, combined with his distinguished appearance and friendly personality, made him for many years a welcome and influential figure at international conferences of architects and similar gatherings. (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 27 July 1951)</blockquote>He was a trustee of Sir John Soane's Museum, and a member of the faculty of architecture at the British School in Rome, the Royal Fine Arts Commission, and the Royal Society of Arts. He became a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and was awarded the Belgian order of the Couronne, but considered his election to the Royal Academy, as an associate in 1933 and a Royal Academician in 1942, as the highest honours conferred upon him, particularly as they were reserved to so few members of his profession.<br>
<br>Distressed by the insistence of the directors of the Cunard Line that his interiors for the <i>Queen Mary</i> should be in an art deco style of which he disapproved, Davis suffered a nervous breakdown on their completion in 1935. He died suddenly on 22 July 1951 at home at 35 Hornton Court, Campden Hill Road, Kensington, his last years having been overshadowed by the rejection in the modern movement of what he saw as the civilized values inherent in traditional classical architecture. He regarded this as wholly unnecessary, since he and Mew&egrave;s had shown how the classical language was entirely compatible with new building types such as modern hotels and liners.<br>
