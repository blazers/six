<span class="headword">Farne,  John  of</span> <span class="st"> [John Whiterig]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1320&#150;1371), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and hermit</span>, was the author of seven Latin meditations. The only surviving manuscript of his work (Durham Cath. CL, MS B.IV.34), written in a late fourteenth-century hand, ascribes them to &#145;a certain monk, formerly a solitary on Farneland&#146;; it also contains theological works by other Durham monks. From his writings it is clear that the author was devout, well read in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the fathers, and the liturgy, and that his special patron saint was John the Evangelist. It also emerges that he had studied at Oxford (perhaps at Durham College) and that one of his meditations was written after an outbreak of plague. Only two Durham monks certainly lived at Farne in the late fourteenth century: John Abell (1357&#150;8), later bursar, and John Whiterig, formerly novice-master (1363&#150;71). It is extremely probable that the latter, who came either from Wheatridge, Northumberland, or from White Ridge, Cumberland, should be identified as the author of these meditations.<br>
<br>From Durham records it seems that Whiterig became a monk <i>c</i>.1346, and visited Farne in 1353 and 1356, when he became novice-master. He continued in this office until 1359 or even 1363, when he settled permanently on Farne. He died there after some twenty-five years as a monk, aged about fifty. Durham Priory had made Farne a regular cell from the early thirteenth century: it usually consisted of two monks. As long ago as the seventh century it had been chosen by &Aacute;ed&aacute;n and Cuthbert for more or less prolonged experience of the solitary life, and by Bartholomew of Farne (<i>d</i>. 1193) for forty-two years. The island attracted a royal endowment of &pound;9 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in the fourteenth century and monks remained there until the dissolution. John chose it as his home when (and perhaps because) Durham was at the height of its prosperity. It had been called &#145;a kind of purgatory on earth&#146;, whose inhabitants &#145;either cultivate sanctity or leave this holy place&#146;  (Farmer, <span class="italic">Monk of Farne</span>, 13). The wind and the sea were and are the principal agents of austerity. Nowadays it is inhabited only by birds and seals.<br>
<br>John Farne's writings are both personal and traditional. His style resembles that of St Bernard, with frequent biblical citations and allusions. Other sources identified include Augustine's <span class="italic">The City of God</span>, Gregory's homilies on the gospels, Bernard's <span class="italic">On the Song of Songs</span> and <span class="italic">On Loving God</span>, and Archbishop Pecham's poem on the nightingale (<span class="italic">Philomena</span>). Another important source was the monastic liturgy. In Farne's last, unfinished, meditation on Cuthbert, Durham's principal patron and Farne's own model, he quoted Bede's life of this saint as well as Reginald of Durham's account of his miracles. Like Cuthbert, he died on Farne, in 1371, possibly from an outbreak of the bubonic plague called the black death. His writings, which were presumably intended for a monastic readership, are an interesting and worthy product of late medieval monastic spirituality. His longest meditation, <span class="italic">Christ Crucified</span>, stresses that God's love for man can only be repaid by man's total love for him. Although seldom mentioning current events in church and state, he prayed to be delivered from &#145;famine, foe and plague&#146;, and to merit &#145;a crown and enter with his judge into everlasting joy&#146;  (Farmer, <span class="italic">Monk of Farne</span>, 110, 151).<br>
