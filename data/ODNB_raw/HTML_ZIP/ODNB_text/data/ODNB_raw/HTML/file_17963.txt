<span class="headword">Manners,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Rutland  (<em>c.</em>1497&#150;1543), <span class="occ">courtier and soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Sir George Manners (<i>b</i>. in or before 1470, <i>d</i>. 1513) of Belvoir, Leicestershire, and his wife, Anne (1476&#150;1526), daughter of Sir Thomas St Leger and Anne, sister of Edward IV. Sir George inherited the barony of Ros following the deaths of his maternal uncle Edmund Roos, tenth Baron Ros (<i>d</i>. 1508), and his maternal aunt Isabel, Lady Lovell (<i>d</i>. 1508/9) (both children of Thomas Ros, ninth Baron Ros of Helmsley). Owing to Edmund Roos's incapacity, since 1486 the barony's estates had been administered by Isabel's husband, Sir Thomas Lovell (<i>c</i>.1449&#150;1524), and he was still in control in 1513 when Sir George died on 27 October or 4 November, either in France or, more probably, having just arrived back in England. Thomas Manners, who succeeded as twelfth baron, was almost certainly under seventeen years old when his father made his will on 26 October, while the inquisition post mortem of 4 April 1514 put his age at sixteen or more. His wardship, and that of his siblings, was granted to Lovell. He had already married (the settlement was dated 21 February 1513) Lovell's niece Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Lovell. <br>
<br>Like his father, Ros went on the French expedition of 1513. He was summoned to the parliament that first met on 5 February 1515, though on the evidence above he should have been too young. His Plantagenet blood, Ros inheritance, and connection with Lovell, who held among other offices the treasurership of the royal household, advanced his career greatly. From early in Henry VIII's reign he was part of the king's household; a jouster, he formed long-standing friendships with Henry and his intimates, including Charles Brandon, later duke of Suffolk. Between about 1514 and 1518 Ros and his brothers were in attendance at various times on Mary Tudor, the French queen. On 7 July 1519 Lovell and Ros were jointly granted the offices of constable of Nottingham Castle and keeper of Sherwood Forest. Ros was at the Field of Cloth of Gold in June 1520 and at Henry VIII's meeting with Emperor Charles V in July. He was on the panel of peers in four out of six treason trials in the House of Lords, including that of the duke of Buckingham. In December 1521 he was the king's cup-bearer and in May 1522 he was deputed to meet Charles V at Dover. At an unknown date his first wife died; some time in the early 1520s he married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1551), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21515/', "Sir William Paston (1479?&#150;1554)")</script>, an occasional attender at court and executor for Lovell following the latter's death on 25 May 1524. On 16 July that year Ros had livery of the rump of the Ros estates which had remained in Lovell's hands. <br>
<br>By this time, although his most significant landed interest lay in Leicestershire, Ros's ancestral properties in Northumberland and Yorkshire had brought him office in the north. In 1522 he was made steward of Pickering in north Yorkshire. Early that year he was given a commission of array and in April was appointed warden of the east and middle marches on the Scottish border, but his lack of personal knowledge of the area proved a handicap, and in October the local gentry's reluctance to participate in the expedition against the Scots led him to seek release from the wardenship. This was granted in October, and did his career no lasting damage. From 1524 to 1526 he was on twelve commissions of the peace, including those for Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, and all three ridings of Yorkshire. After initial election on 24 April, he was installed as a knight of the Garter on 25 June 1525, having been created a week earlier earl of Rutland; the king acknowledged his Plantagenet descent in the arms granted with the title. By 1528 he had begun rebuilding Belvoir Castle; in the meantime he resided at Elsinges Manor, Enfield, Middlesex, or, when in London, at Holywell, Shoreditch, or at court. <br>
<br>Although he initially appeared hesitant, Rutland supported Henry VIII's religious policies. In 1533 he was verbally attacked by Thomas Boleyn, earl of Wiltshire, for suggesting that the king's marriage to his daughter Anne was a spiritual matter and could not be settled in parliament. However, Rutland was at Anne's coronation as her carver. In 1535 he was involved on behalf of the crown in the notorious trial of the Charterhouse monks. In the rebellions of 1536 he was charged with the defence of Nottingham Castle. Given a joint command with the earls of Huntingdon and Shrewsbury, he marched promptly to Nottingham and then to Newark, Southwell, and Doncaster. His stewardship of many monasteries, and his ancestral claims to the foundation of certain houses, combined with his proven loyalty to work to his advantage in the wake of the dissolution. By a grant of March 1539, in return for selling to the king land including Elsinges, he received at least fourteen manors (mostly in Leicestershire) and several abbeys, including Rievaulx and Beverley, Yorkshire, and Belvoir Priory and Croxton, Leicestershire. Croxton soon became his main provincial residence. <br>
<br>In July 1536 Rutland cemented his ties to other noble families with a triple wedding at Holywell, in which his eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17955/', "Henry Manners (1526&#150;1563)")</script> and daughter Lady Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1549) married Lady Margaret Neville and Henry Neville, Lord Neville (1524/5&#150;1564), children of Ralph Neville, fourth earl of Westmorland, and Lady Dorothy Neville married John de Vere, heir of the earl of Oxford. Rutland was lord chamberlain to Jane Seymour, and, though illness kept him from court for a significant period in spring 1537, he was in attendance when she died in October. He was also chamberlain to Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. Lady Rutland served in the privy chambers of the first two queens and possibly of the third. Her position and perceived good nature made her a valuable contact at court for those outside it, such as the governor of Calais, Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle, and his wife, Honor, whose daughters she supervised and assisted. In 1540 Lady Rutland testified against Queen Anne that the royal marriage had not been consummated. In response to the latter's na&iuml;ve assertion that the king's bedchamber performances were proof of her loss of virginity, the countess responded, &#145;Madam, there must be more than this, or it will be long or we have a duke of York, which al this realm most desireth&#146;  (Strype). Following the subsequent fall of Thomas Cromwell, Rutland acquired his former offices of warden of the forests beyond the Trent and steward of Halifax manor, Yorkshire. <br>
<br>Having refused reappointment to the east and middle marches in 1537, five years later Rutland became constable of Nottingham Castle and then returned to the borders on 9 August 1542 as warden of all three marches. He was soon reassigned to lead the rearguard of an army prepared to invade Scotland in October. Difficulty in finding a replacement led to his reappointment as warden-general on 2 November, but he was quickly recalled owing to illness. He had made his will on 16 August, but lingered well into the following year, dying at Belvoir Castle on 20 September 1543. He was buried in Bottesford church, Leicestershire, where a dignified alabaster tomb was erected. His widow, who died at Holywell in 1551, was buried at St Leonard, Shoreditch. Rutland died a rich man, owning about 100 manors and with an annual income of &pound;2399, according to 1542 receivers' accounts. He brought the Manners family to new heights, ensuring for the dynasty a national presence for centuries to come.<br>
