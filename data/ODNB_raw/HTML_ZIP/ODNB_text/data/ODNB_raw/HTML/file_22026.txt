<span class="headword">Peters,  (Matthew) William</span>  (1742&#150;1814), <span class="occ">portrait and genre painter and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Freshwater, Isle of Wight. His father, Matthew Peters (<i>b</i>. 1711), was described on the 1778 engraving by Murphy after his son's portrait as &#145;Member of the Dublin Society and author of several treatises on tillage and agriculture&#146;. His mother was the daughter of George Young of Dublin. Shortly after the birth of William (as he became known early in life, signing himself W. Peters) the family moved to Dublin, where Matthew Peters advised on the improvement of loughs and rivers for navigation.<br>
<br>William Peters was trained as an artist by Robert West in the first School of Design in Dublin; he received prizes in 1756 and 1758. The Dublin Society sent him to London where, when a pupil of Thomas Hudson in 1759, he won a premium from the Society of Arts. The Dublin Society paid for him to go to Italy (&pound;30 per annum) and he arrived in Rome on 6 May 1762, having by his own account left Dublin for Cadiz in August 1761. He was delayed at sea &#145;beating about in the &hellip; equinoctial storms&#146;  (Ingamells, 763), and was then stranded for three months in Gibraltar. In Rome he studied life drawing at the Accademia del Nudo and at Pompeo Batoni's private academy. He was elected to the Accademia del Disegno in Florence on 23 September 1762.<br>
<br>Peters left Italy at the end of 1764, and was back in England in 1765. He exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1766 to 1769 from Tavistock Row (1766), Bond Street (1767), Suffolk Street (1768), and Welbeck Street (1769). On 27 February 1769 he became a freemason (Somerset House Lodge No. 2): he was made grand portrait painter of the Freemasons and first provincial grand master of Lincolnshire in 1792. The final works that Peters exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1785 were portraits of the duke of Manchester and Lord Petre as grand master.<br>
<br>Peters exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1769, and was elected associate in 1771 and academician in 1777. He was back in Florence by 5 November 1771 but by 1773 he was in Venice, from where he sent works to the Royal Academy exhibition that year and the next, and where he presumably painted <span class="italic">Edward Wortley Montagu in his Dress as an Arabian Prince</span> (NPG) in 1775. He exhibited in 1776 from Great Newport Street, Horace Walpole noting that he was &#145;just returned from Rome&#146;  (Ingamells). Peters also spent time in Paris, including (probably) 1783&#150;4, where he was friendly with L.-P. Boilly and Antoine Vestier, and was influenced by Greuze.<br>
<br>However, no British contemporary had such an Italian manner of painting as Peters, reflecting the old masters he copied: for example Correggio's <span class="italic">Madonna of St Jerome</span> in Parma (parish church of Saffron Walden, Essex) and Barocci's <span class="italic">Madonna della scudella</span> in Perugia (1774), for which he was paid the substantial sum of 100 guineas by Robert, first Baron Clive. Peters's copy of Titian's <span class="italic">Venus of Urbino</span> is probably &#145;the Couchant Venus&#146; attributed to Titian in the sale of the pictures of Richard, first Earl Grosvenor, following his death in 1802. The next lot in the same sale was Peters's most notorious composition, <span class="italic">Lydia</span> (exh. RA, 1777; Tate collection) showing a woman in bed, her prominent breasts and erect nipples frankly revealed. The <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> (26 April 1777) commented in laboured <i>doubles entendres</i>:<blockquote>[the picture] makes every gentleman <i>stand</i> for some time &hellip; the inviting leer of the lady and her still more inviting bosom, ought to be consigned to the bed chamber of a <i>bagnio</i>, where each would doubtless <i>provoke</i> a proper effect.</blockquote>It did Peters no harm: he was elected Royal Academician the same year. He made numerous compositions of a similar kind, all with the principal erotic charge of bare breasts, uncovered on one pretext or another, and all of these works were engraved and popular. Peters later regretted these <i>jeux d'esprit</i>: in 1781 he was ordained deacon and subsequently priest in 1782, having gone up to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1779 with this purpose. He was chaplain to the Royal Academy from 1784 to 1788 (when he resigned from the academy) and chaplain to the prince of Wales (he was also founding secretary of the Prince of Wales's Lodge, 1787).<br>
<br>Charles Manners, fourth duke of Rutland, presented Peters to the living of Scalford, Leicestershire, in 1784, and Peters became an enthusiastic but conscientious pluralist. In 1788 the dowager duchess (whom he had portrayed in 1783 as <span class="italic">An Angel Carrying the Spirit of a Child to Paradise</span>, priv. coll.) added the living of Knipton, when Peters also gained Woolsthorpe, both close to Belvoir Castle, where he became curator of pictures. He became prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral in 1795, at first with the stall of St Mary, Crackpool, quickly exchanged for the better living of Langford Ecclesia, Oxfordshire, to which he added Eaton (near Knipton) in the same year. He lived variously at Woolsthorpe, Knipton, and Langford, scrupulously maintaining the parish registers in Woolsthorpe and Knipton until 1806, and building a new church at Woolsthorpe in 1791 (replaced 1845). He painted numerous religious works, including a 10 by 5 feet <span class="italic">Annunciation</span> for Lincoln Cathedral (1799; subdeanery, Lincoln) and <span class="italic">The Resurrection of a Pious Family</span>, a picture won by the father of the future Cardinal Manning in a sovereign raffle and given to the church in Totteridge, Hertfordshire (sold in 1886). He painted five Shakespearian subjects for Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery from 1786, six for the Irish Shakespeare Gallery, and continued to paint portraits, charging 80 guineas for a full length in 1794. He married Margaret Susannah Knowsley, daughter and co-heir of the Revd John Fleming of Burton Fleming, Yorkshire, on 28 April 1790 at St James's, Piccadilly, London; there were five children.<br>
<br>Masonic quarrels persuaded Peters to live chiefly in Langford from about 1800. Other old habits perhaps died hard, for in 1810&#150;11 he upset the locals with a &#145;certain sketch&#146;  (Hodgson and Eaton), and took refuge at Brasted Place, Kent, where he died, a rich man, on 20 March 1814.<br>
