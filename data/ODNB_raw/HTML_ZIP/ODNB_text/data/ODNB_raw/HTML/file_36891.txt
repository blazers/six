<span class="headword">Wigram,  Woolmore</span>  (1831&#150;1907), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and campanologist</span>, was the fifth son of ten children of Money Wigram (1790&#150;1873), director of the Bank of England, of Manor Place, Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, and Mary, daughter of Charles Hampden Turner, of Rooks Nest, Godstone, Surrey. He was born on 29 October 1831 at Devonshire Place, London. His father's mother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55217/', "Eleanor Wigram, Lady Wigram")</script>. His father was the elder brother of Sir James Wigram, Joseph Cotton Wigram, and George Vicesimus Wigram. Of his own brothers, Charles Hampden (1826&#150;1903) was knighted in 1902, and Clifford (1828&#150;1898) became director of the Bank of England. Wigram entered Rugby School in August 1844, and in 1850 matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1854 and proceeded MA in 1858. Among his close friends at Cambridge was John Gott (1830&#150;1906), afterwards bishop of Truro. After taking holy orders in 1855, Wigram was curate of Hampstead (1855&#150;64), vicar of Brent Pelham with Furneaux Pelham, Hertfordshire (1864&#150;76), and rector of St Andrew's with St Nicholas's and St Mary's, Hertford (1876&#150;97). From 1877 to 1897 he was rural dean of Hertford, and in 1886 was made honorary canon of St Albans, where he lived from 1898 until his death, and was an active member of the chapter. A high-churchman, Wigram was for a long time a member of the English Church Union. He married on 23 July 1863 Harriet Mary (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/233/', "Revd Thomas Ainger")</script> of Hampstead; they had four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58374/', "William Ainger Wigram")</script>, who became an advocate of the Assyrian church and people, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Wigram was an enthusiastic campanologist, and became an authority on the subject. A series of articles in <span class="italic">Church Bells</span> was collected in 1871 under the title <span class="italic">Change-Ringing Disentangled and Management of Towers</span>.<br>
<br>In his earlier days Wigram was an enthusiastic alpine climber. He was a member of the Alpine Club from 1858 to 1868. His most memorable feat was the first successful ascent, in the company of Thomas Stewart Kennedy (with Jean Baptiste Croz and Josef Marie Kr&ouml;nig as guides), of La Dent Blanche, near Zermatt, on 18 July 1862.<br>
<br>Wigram died from the effects of influenza at his home, Watling House, Watling Street, St Albans, on 19 January 1907, and was buried in St Stephen's churchyard there. His wife survived him.<br>
