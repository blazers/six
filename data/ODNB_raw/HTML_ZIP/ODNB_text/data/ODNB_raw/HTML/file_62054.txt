<span class="headword">Pascal,  Roy</span>  (1904&#150;1980), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born at 60 Herrick Road, Saltley, Birmingham, on 28 February 1904, the third of four sons of Colin Sydney Pascal (1866/7&#150;1949), master grocer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edmonds (1866/7&#150;1953). As a foundation and a King Edward's scholar he attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he excelled as a sportsman as well as academically. He was then awarded a scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied modern languages. On the whole he found the teaching at Cambridge uninspiring, the one shining exception being E. K. (Francis) Bennett, who introduced him to the study of imaginative literature and encouraged him to develop his own critical judgements (however controversial they might be). In 1924 he attended a summer school in Berlin. That summer was to prove decisive. His literary interests (especially his love for Goethe's poetry), his quickened sense of the interplay of ideas and socio-historical reality, and his political awakening, above all to the dangers of fascism, convinced him to devote his professional life to Germany and to things German. He returned to Cambridge, graduated with a first in 1927, and was subsequently awarded a Tiarks scholarship. He spent the winter semester in Berlin and the summer semester in Munich. On his return to Cambridge he began teaching and became a fellow of Pembroke College. On 27 June 1931 he married Feiga (Fania) Polianovskaya (1901&#150;1985/6), whom he had met in Berlin; she was of Ukrainian Jewish descent, the daughter of Moses Polianovsky, timber merchant, and later taught Russian in Cambridge (to Ludwig Wittgenstein among others). They had two daughters, Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1932) and Susan (<i>b</i>. 1935). Fania had a delightful sense of humour and was a wonderful emotional and intellectual support to him throughout his life.<br>
<br>Pascal's first book, <span class="italic">The Social Basis of the German Reformation</span> (1933), gave primacy to the interplay of religious ideas, economics, and social change, and bore the imprint of his conversion to Marxism. As a newly appointed lecturer he attended his first meeting of the Conference of University Teachers of German in 1936 (he was later to become its chairman in 1960&#150;61). At the meeting in 1936 he urged his colleagues to send a formal resolution to the German government protesting at the victimization of Jewish and democratically minded academics at German universities. The resolution was not adopted; some colleagues were suspicious of his close links with the Communist Party, and a number felt that some kind of contact with Germany and German institutions should be kept open. Throughout the early years of his career Pascal felt that historical and political analysis had to take precedence in his scholarly work&#151;hence his study <span class="italic">The Nazi Dictatorship</span> (1934), <span class="italic">The German Ideology</span>, his translation and edition of the work by Marx and Engels (1938), and his books, published in the immediate aftermath of the war, <span class="italic">The Growth of Modern Germany</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">The German Revolution of 1848</span> (1948). He was also active in the lecturers' professional association, the Association of University Teachers, of which he was president in 1944&#150;5.<br>
<br>In 1939 Pascal moved to the chair of German at the University of Birmingham which he held for the next thirty years. Birmingham allowed him (in a way that Cambridge had not) to reform the curriculum of the undergraduate course in German, achieving an interplay between linguistic, literary, cultural, and historico-political concerns. He created a formidable department by appointing such scholars as William Burley (Bill) Lockwood, Richard Hinton Thomas, and Siegbert Prawer. The hum and buzz of that German department bore witness to the magnificent intellectual range and reach that animated all his subsequent publications. <span class="italic">The German Sturm und Drang</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">From Naturalism to Expressionism</span> (1973) combined richly perceptive analyses of literary styles, genres, and forms with a revelatory ability to relate those aesthetic matters to social and moral concerns. His <span class="italic">Design and Truth in Autobiography</span> (1960) was wonderful in its generosity of reference and argument; at its centre was the existential question of the interplay of coherence (on the one hand) and contingency (on the other) in the human personality and in the individual's perception of that personality. Three major monographs revealed the full extent of his acuity as a literary critic&#151;<span class="italic">The German Novel</span> (1956), <span class="italic">The Dual Voice</span> (1977), and <span class="italic">Kafka's Narrators</span> (1982), the latter published posthumously. Particularly the last two of these studies showed him engaging with theoretical (and at that time heavily theorized) issues&#151;and yet, characteristically, he wrote not in order to produce some rebarbatively schematic taxonomy but rather to highlight the sheer complexity of what happens in the human act of storytelling.<br>
<br>It was one of many bitter ironies that as Pascal distanced himself more and more from the extreme left, and as his scholarly work moved increasingly towards literary questions, he found himself confronted in the late 1960s by a group of students in his own department who (like himself many years earlier) had been radicalized by their time in Germany. The turmoil of that time was inseparable from Pascal's anguish at confronting his own past. Yet he had never been a mere ideologue, and while a few colleagues in German studies continued to regard him with suspicion, he was admired and loved by the generality of the profession. The respect in which he was held was confirmed by the award of the Goethe medal (1965) and the Hamburg Shakespeare prize (1969), by his election to a fellowship of the British Academy (1970) and to an honorary fellowship of Pembroke College, Cambridge (1976), and by the conferral of honorary doctorates by the universities of Birmingham (1974) and Warwick (1977). He was a superb translator&#151;<span class="italic">Iphigenia in Tauris</span> was a beautiful verse translation of Goethe's drama that was twice performed on BBC radio&#151;and a remarkable teacher&#151;patient, unemphatic, never inhibiting. He always related the complexity of the literary text to his readers' common humanity.<br>
<br>Roy Pascal was a man of rich gifts and capacities. He was a skilled angler, and his knowledge of the countryside and of the towns and buildings of the midlands was astonishing. He loved taking friends and colleagues for walks, pointing out features of interest and beauty that might otherwise go unremarked. His years of retirement, which began with a very happy spell at McMaster University in Canada, were serene and productive until his health began to fail him. He died at his home, 102 Witherford Way, Selly Oak, Birmingham, of heart failure on 24 August 1980. He was survived by his wife, Fania, and their two daughters.<br>
