<span class="headword">Cummings,  William Hayman</span>  (1831&#150;1915), <span class="occ">singer and musical antiquary</span>, was born on 22 August 1831 at Sidbury, Devon, the son of Edward Manly Cummings and his wife, Julia. The family moved to London and he became a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. Because William Hawes conducted practices with the help of a riding crop, Cummings's father was compelled to petition the court of chancery in 1842 for the boy's release from such harsh discipline. Cummings then joined the Temple Church choir and secured from E. J. Hopkins, the organist and choirmaster, an excellent musical grounding, including organ lessons. Hopkins later encouraged him to apply, successfully, for the position of organist of Waltham Abbey. Here it was that in 1855 Cummings made his most enduring mark. His generation venerated Mendelssohn; certainly Cummings's own choral compositions owe him much. In any event, he was sufficiently familiar with Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Festgesang</span>, an occasional cantata in celebration of the 1840 Gutenberg festival, to unite the music of its second number with Charles Wesley's hymn &#145;Hark! the herald angels sing&#146;. Cummings left Waltham Abbey to take up a long and distinguished career as a lyric tenor &#145;of singular sweetness and purity&#146;, particularly in the field of oratorio. His only instructor was J. W. Hobbs, a lay clerk at Westminster Abbey, whose daughter Clara he later married. For his &#145;wonted skill and good taste&#146; and reliable musicianship he was much sought after for London concerts and provincial festivals. At Norwich in 1866, for example, he had to sing everything, some pieces at a moment's notice, when Sims Reeves, the other principal tenor, fell ill. From November 1871, Cummings made the first of two tours of the United States with a small vocal ensemble supporting the baritone Charles Santley.<br>
<br>In London, Cummings taught singing at the Royal Normal School and the School for the Blind. He was appointed a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in 1879, but resigned in 1896 to become principal of a sister institution, the Guildhall School of Music. In the fourteen years before his retirement, he modernized the curriculum. Cummings enjoyed scholarly pursuits. From the age of nineteen he visited auction rooms and successfully bid for important manuscripts and rarities as diverse as autograph scores of Purcell and Beethoven and one of Handel's lace ruffles. His superb library of some 4500 pieces, the last of the great Victorian collections, was undoubtedly the catalyst for Cummings's editions for the Purcell Society (1878, 1889, and 1891) and his monographs on the national anthem (1902), John Blow (1909), and Thomas Arne (1912), which remained useful sources for more than a century. Upon his death the library was sold at auction and, unfortunately, dispersed as far afield as America and Japan. Thus was sadly fulfilled the prophecy that Cummings himself had made in a paper about national collections (1871) to the (Royal) Musical Association, a body of which he was a founding member. Although contemporaries noted in him a certain inflexibility towards others' opinions, his integrity of purpose and devotion to English music was never in question. For such efforts he was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1884), Doctor of Music (h.c.) of Trinity College, Dublin (1900), and honorary treasurer of the Royal Society of Musicians. Cummings died at his home, Sydcote, Rosendale Road, Dulwich, London, on 6 June 1915; the funeral service took place on 10 June in the church of St John the Evangelist, Dulwich, and he was interred at Norwood cemetery.<br>
