<span class="headword">Perse,  Stephen</span>  (1547/8&#150;1615), <span class="occ">physician and benefactor</span>, was born in either 1547 or 1548, the son of John Perse, landowner, of Great Massingham, Norfolk. He was educated at a school in Norwich before being admitted, aged seventeen, as a pensioner of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 29 October 1565. He graduated BA in 1569, and proceeded MA in 1572 and MD in 1581. Perse was elected to a fellowship of Caius in 1571 and, at university level, was elected to the <i>caput senatus</i> in 1589. He was ordained deacon and priest of Peterborough on 7 May 1573.<br>
<br>In 1582 Perse was implicated in a dispute between the master of Caius, Thomas Legge, and a majority of the fellows. Legge was accused of advancing Catholicism, maladministration, and acting without the consent of the fellows. Perse was held up as an example of the master's favouritism, having been allowed by Legge, without consultation, to change from a divinity to a medical fellowship and back again, and then to study medicine while holding a divinity fellowship. He was among those who supported Legge, and served alongside him and his successor as college bursar intermittently between 1586 and 1614. In 1603 he contributed to a collection of verses by members of the university celebrating James I's accession, <span class="italic">Threno-thriambeuticon</span>. He also composed the verse which was to be inscribed on his tomb.<br>
<br>Perse practised medicine in Cambridge, but it was as a result of investments in property and moneylending that he built up a personal fortune, which at the time of his death included &pound;600 in property and leases, &pound;10,000 in good debts, and over &pound;3,000 in &#145;desperate debts&#146;  (CUL, university archives, records of the vice-chancellor's court, probate records, Perse's inventory, 1615). In his will he set out a scheme whereby small sums of money were to be lent out to local tradesmen, the interest so generated to be used in support of his charitable causes. The scheme fell through, but is illustrative of the connection Perse made between investment and charity. Two yeomen from Haddenham, Berkshire, who brought an unsuccessful petition against Perse for demanding excessive repayment between 1611 and 1613 in the court of chancery, seem to have viewed his efforts less favourably.<br>
<br>Perse died on 30 September 1615 and was buried in the college chapel. He and Legge were commemorated in effigy in near identical tombs. By a will dated 27 September, Perse divided his estate between charitable causes and his family. In one of the few clues as to his religion he named Valentine Carey, dean of St Paul's Cathedral and a noted supporter of the established church, as one of his executors. His will provided for the foundation of a free grammar school in Cambridge for local boys. It also established six fellowships and six scholarships at Caius, as well as the construction of a new building for the college, roads, and almshouses for local poor. Caius still celebrates Perse in an annual feast in his honour. Bequests to Mrs Ellvin, describing her as his &#145;mother-in-law&#146;, have given rise to the misapprehension that Perse was married. However, by the terms of his fellowship, he was required to remain celibate; and it is more likely that the expression was contemporary usage for stepmother.<br>
<br>Perse's will was precise, distributing a fixed income according to a rigid formula without regard for inflation. The master and fellows of Gonville and Caius, the administrators of the trust, became the sole beneficiaries of the increasing surplus which eventually developed, while the school itself was decaying by 1805. A chancery suit brought against the trustees in 1837 was heard by Henry Bickersteth, Baron Langdale, master of the rolls, who as a Perse fellow himself in 1830 drew attention to the iniquities of the scheme and paid back the excess he had received as a result. His judgment resulted in a new scheme for distribution of the trust's income, while further reform in 1873 resulted in the foundation of the Perse School for Girls in 1881. The school became a highly successful establishment as a result and moved to Hills Road in 1888.<br>
