<span class="headword">Hadingham,  Reginald Edward Hawke <span class="st"> [Buzzer]</span></span>  (1915&#150;2004), <span class="occ">businessman and tennis administrator</span>, was born on 6 December 1915 at 30 Beukplein, The Hague, one of four sons of Edward Wallace (Tim) Hadingham, naval officer and businessman, and his wife, (Ethel) Irene Penelope, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gwynne-Evans. He was born in the Netherlands as his father was interned by the Germans during the First World War but was allowed to have his wife join him. His forenames are attributed to Reggie Doherty, the Wimbledon champion in 1897&#150;1900, to whom his mother had once been engaged, and to his father's favourite admiral who vanquished the French at Quiberon Bay. He himself preferred the sobriquet Buzzer bestowed on &#145;my baby buzzer&#146; (brother) by Tony, his two-year-old elder sibling.<br>
<br>After the war the family went to live at Wimbledon&#151;within walking distance of the courts of the All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club&#151;where he remained for the rest of his life. He attended Rokeby preparatory school and became captain of cricket and rugby and head of house; his secondary education was at St Paul's in west London. In 1933 he joined Slazenger, the sports equipment firm, where his father was managing director. Seven years later, on 13 January 1940, he married Lois Pope, daughter of Edward and Nova Pope; the couple had two daughters, Susan and Steffie. During the Second World War Hadingham served as a Royal Artillery anti-tank specialist in north Africa and Italy, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and being awarded the Military Cross and bar. He converted to Roman Catholicism on his return from war service. In 1946 he resumed his Slazenger business career, in which capacity he used his fluent French and German as an export manager. He became sales director in 1952, managing director in 1969, and chairman in 1973, finally retiring in 1983, by which time the company had become a world leader in its field. During this last decade he served on the Sports Council and was chairman of Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. His retirement enabled him to take on an even bigger task in sports administration from 1983: chairmanship of the All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, with responsibility for hosting the Wimbledon tennis championships.<br>
<br>Although, in his own words, Hadingham was &#145;totally committed&#146; to Wimbledon's role as &#145;guardian of tradition&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Nov 1985), he was not against innovation. During his six years as chairman he oversaw the introduction of yellow tennis balls, the opening of the gates before noon, the start of play before 2 p.m., and the upgrading of facilities for media coverage, especially for television. He was a diplomat: following an altercation between two journalists, both emerged from a meeting with Hadingham convinced that they had been vindicated. However, he had less success in trying to persuade John McEnroe to modify his on-court behaviour, particularly his outbursts against the Wimbledon match officials. He resigned from his Wimbledon duties in 1989 to spend more time with his wife, who had suffered a stroke.<br>
<br>Hadingham's appointment as OBE (1971) and CBE (1988) was in recognition not just of his business activities and sports administration but also his charity work. In the 1950s he joined Sportsmen Pledged to Aid Research into Crippling Diseases (later SPARKS), when its focus was on the National Polio Fund. Between 1968 and 1994 he was the charity's chairman and played a significant role in establishing it as a major funder of children's medical research. An enthusiastic communicator who loved to speak at sporting events and fund-raising dinners, he persuaded both Douglas Bader and Leonard Cheshire, his favourite tennis partner, to serve terms as president, and Princess Michael of Kent to become its royal patron.<br>
<br>Hadingham was a clubman. As well as the All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club he was a member of Queen's, the Hurlingham, the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain, and the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin. In 1984, after being embarrassed by a former finalist's not having a ticket for the Centre Court, he established a Last-Eight club for singles quarter-finalists. Membership allowed them tickets for themselves and a guest, discounts at the players' hotels, and entry to several social functions. Organizers of the other grand slam tennis tournaments later followed suit. Earlier, in 1948, he had joined the Sette of Odd Volumes, a private dining and literary club founded in 1878. A membership proposal, based on his writings on ancient Assyria, had been promised by a fellow army officer during a shared sojourn in a hazardous trench provided they both survived. A humorous, dapper man with great personal charm, Buzzer Hadingham played tennis into his eighties (before being halted by a second hip operation), wrote verse, and enjoyed bridge. He died of cancer at St George's Hospital, Tooting, London on 27 December 2004 and was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
