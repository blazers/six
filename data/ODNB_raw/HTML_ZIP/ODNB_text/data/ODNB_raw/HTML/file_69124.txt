<span class="headword">Dunnett, Sir  (Ludovic) James <span class="st"> [Ned]</span></span>  (1914&#150;1997), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in India on 12 February 1914, the second son and second of the four children of Sir James Macdonald Dunnett (1877&#150;1953) of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Annie (<i>d</i>. 1951), youngest daughter of William Sangster. His father had a distinguished career in India, and was reforms commissioner of the government of India from 1930 to 1936. Ned Dunnett, as he was known, spent much of his youth with two aunts in Edinburgh. He attended Edinburgh Academy from 1920 to 1932. He proved a distinguished pupil both academically and athletically. He was dux of the school in his last year and excelled at rugby. From the academy he went to University College, Oxford, where he gained a second class in classical moderations in 1934 and a second in Greats in 1936.<br>
<br>In 1936 Dunnett passed well up the list into the administrative class of the home civil service and joined the Air Ministry. A year later he became private secretary to Sir Arthur Street, permanent under-secretary of state throughout the Second World War. Dunnett spent seven years as private secretary. Street had a tremendous capacity for hard work and was a demanding master as well as an exemplar, from whom Dunnett learned much. On 27 August 1943 Dunnett married Olga Adair (1909/10&#150;1980), daughter of Samuel Adair, civil servant. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1945 Dunnett moved to the Ministry of Civil Aviation&#151;a new department. He was promoted to under-secretary at thirty-four, and at thirty-nine became a deputy secretary in the Ministry of Supply. In the first ministry he was deeply involved in the rapid expansion of international civil aviation. When he moved on, his primary responsibility was for the research, development, and the procurement of weapons for the separate service ministries. This was a period of steeply rising costs, and the service ministries were generally hostile to the separate Ministry of Supply. He was appointed CMG in 1948 and CB in 1957.<br>
<br>In 1959 Dunnett became permanent secretary of the Ministry of Transport, with the extrovert Ernest Marples as his minister, trying to solve Britain's increasing traffic problems and deal with the diminishing British merchant fleet. He was promoted KCB in 1960. In 1962 he moved to the Ministry of Labour. Incomes policy and the need to improve industrial relations were major national issues. Earlier in his career Dunnett had established good relations with many industrial and trade union leaders. He was a breath of fresh air in the Ministry of Labour, which too often in the past had contented itself by accepting solutions agreed upon by unions and employers. Dunnett took a more interventionist view. During his term some major changes were enacted covering contracts of employment, the training board system, and redundancy payments. He retained a lifelong interest in industrial relations.<br>
<br>Dunnett was a natural choice to become permanent under-secretary of state for defence in 1966. The three service departments had by then become constitutionally one, under one secretary of state. Nevertheless, the change remained more theoretical than practical. Dunnett wished to produce an organization that would work effectively on defence as a whole rather than on individual services. To bring this about he set up the headquarters organization committee. Old attitudes and loyalties change slowly and die hard, and his success was limited. Moreover, Britain was lurching from one economic crisis to another and defence reviews and cuts were the order of the day. Inter-service rivalry was intense and there were difficult relations with some allies, not least when economic factors forced a decision to withdraw from east of Suez. To this was added Dunnett's appointment to the Fulton committee, set up in February 1966 to review the civil service. Reporting in June 1968, the committee made his workload virtually impossible. Moreover, he did not enjoy a happy home life and his consumption of alcohol was high. Dunnett had privately hoped to become permanent secretary of the newly created civil service department and head of the home civil service. It was not to be. Nevertheless, he did produce a more coherent Ministry of Defence before he retired in 1974, and from 1972 the procurement executive brought together the research, development, and procurement functions for all three services. He was promoted GCB in 1969.<br>
<br>Dunnett was a permanent secretary for fifteen years in three different departments. Although he was a shy man, on occasion appearing awkward and ill at ease, many who worked for him stood in considerable awe of him. He had a formidable presence, and was good at asking penetrating questions and at synthesizing the ideas of others. His instincts and actions consistently favoured reorganization and change. He did not suffer fools gladly and saw himself as a manager. He enjoyed watching both rugby and football and was a very good golfer. He knew many people outside the civil service, not least trade union and business leaders.<br>
<br>Dunnett was a visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1964 to 1972. He was an active member of the Social Science Research Council from 1977 to 1982; chairman of the International Maritime Industries Forum from 1976 to 1979; and president of the Institute of Manpower Studies from 1977 to 1988. He was a trustee of the Charities Aid Foundation from 1974 to 1988. In his later years his eyesight began to fail him, which he found frustrating. His first wife having died in 1980, on 24 March 1984 he married Clarisse, Lady Grover, widow of Sir Anthony Charles Grover, chairman of Lloyd's register of shipping (1963&#150;73), and daughter of B&euml;la Feher, banker. His second marriage was happy, and thanks to his wife he moved in more artistic circles. He died in London of heart failure at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, on 30 December 1997, and his remains were cremated on 9 January 1998. He was survived by his wife, Clarisse.<br>
