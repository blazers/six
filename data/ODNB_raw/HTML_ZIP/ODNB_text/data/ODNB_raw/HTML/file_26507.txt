<span class="headword">Stewart,  Robert</span>, Viscount Castlereagh and second marquess of Londonderry  (1769&#150;1822), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Dublin on 18 June 1769, second but only surviving son of the first marriage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26506/', "Robert Stewart (1739&#150;1821)")</script> of Mount Stewart, co. Down, to Lady Sarah Frances Seymour Conway (1747&#150;1770), daughter of Francis, first marquess of Hertford. He was baptized a Presbyterian on 5 July 1769, as befitted the heir of one of the denominational leaders in Ulster. His mother died on 18 July 1770, bequeathing him the physical allure of her family. His father, member for County Down in the Dublin parliament from 1771 to 1783, remarried in 1775 and had three sons and eight daughters. Their mother, Frances, was the eldest daughter of Charles, first Baron (later Earl) Camden, the lord chancellor, and it was at his instigation that Stewart, who had been educated at the Royal School, Armagh, from 1777 to 1781 and thereafter by a tutor, the Revd William Sturrock of Portaferry, entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1786. There he was regarded as a first-class student, though he did not graduate.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareerto1802"></a>Early political career to 1802</h2>In 1790, after a continental tour, Stewart returned home to win a seat for Down in the Irish parliament. This involved him in a highly expensive contest lasting forty-two days, during which he came of age, to wrest one of the two county seats from the monopoly of the marquess of Downshire. His father, despite his previous volunteering and reformist activities, which bespoke a critic of the Irish establishment, had in 1789 become an Irish peer, as Baron Londonderry, though Stewart himself joined the Northern Whig Club. Several other circumstances, however, combined to curb the opposition politics expected of him. His stepgrandfather and confidant, Earl Camden, was a committed adherent of Pitt the younger in office, and Stewart had admired Pitt's oratory from the public gallery of the Commons. During a visit to Paris in 1791 he conceived an immediate dislike for the proceedings he witnessed in the national assembly and became a critic of the new French constitution. He returned prepared to tolerate any government, even the Irish one, as long as it shunned revolution. In Dublin he walked a political tightrope for a time: favourable to Catholic relief, but cautious about extending this indulgence to political enfranchisement; supportive of war against France, yet prepared to be critical of the conduct of it. He became a lieutenant-colonel of the County Londonderry militia on 26 April 1793 (colonel in 1798). Suddenly in April 1794 Pitt swooped on him, offering him a seat for Tregony, a Cornish borough, in the Westminster parliament as a ministerial nominee. He accepted the bargain, and was duly elected on 12 May, though he did not then take his seat. On 9 June of that year, in London, he married Lady Amelia Anne Hobart (1772&#150;1829), youngest daughter (only surviving child of a second marriage) and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13394/', "John Hobart, second earl of Buckinghamshire")</script>, formerly lord lieutenant of Ireland: there were no children of the marriage. Required to second the address in Dublin on 22 January 1795, which he did in a drawling, verbose manner that triggered the first of many criticisms of his speech-making, Stewart had to speak again later in the session to oblige his step-uncle, John Jeffreys Pratt, second Earl Camden, who became lord lieutenant of Ireland soon afterwards. His d&eacute;but at Westminster on 29 October 1795, when he took more pains as seconder of the address commending the counter-revolutionary war against France, was an unmistakable omen of his ambition for future Anglicization.<br>
<br>Stewart himself did not yet realize this. Unbeknown to him, Camden had suggested him to Pitt as his chief secretary in Dublin, commending his lack of Irish prejudices. Stewart defended Pitt in the Irish parliament in January 1796, but in April and May was back at Westminster after assuring Camden, Janus-faced, that his preference was for an Irish political career. On 4 May Camden, who advised him to make the most of sitting in both parliaments, informed Pitt that Stewart wished for a seat in the next English parliament, placing a ceiling of &pound;2000 on its acquisition. His seat, for Orford, was in fact provided by his uncle, Lord Hertford, as patron of that borough. He arrived in England in July when the session was prorogued, and did not appear at Westminster again before resigning his seat there on 19 July 1797. Events in Ireland had dictated this. On 8 August 1796 his father became earl of Londonderry, and Stewart became by courtesy Viscount Castlereagh (a title obtained by his father the year before). Camden, who wished to retain him in Ireland as long as he himself remained there, leaned on his local experience, and entrusted the seizure of the United Irish ringleaders in Belfast to him in September. Unrest among his father's tenantry also preoccupied him. In February 1797 he proposed defence measures in the Irish parliament, and in May moved a loyal address. He was rewarded, on 25 July, with a sinecure worth &pound;1500, the keepership of the Irish privy seal. In October he became a lord of the Irish treasury and an Irish privy councillor. He retained his county seat in the Dublin parliament of 1798, though also elected for the borough of Newtownlimavady, co. Londonderry, as security. Camden secured Castlereagh as his chief secretary on 29 March 1798, though he admitted that the recipient himself was reluctant: this was nominally a temporary appointment during the illness of his predecessor Thomas Pelham. A proclamation against sedition a day later was followed by strong-arm tactics directed against the United Irish leaders by the militia, for which Castlereagh, who promptly sent to England for regular military aid, was later blamed. His detention of the leaders in May, however, was commended at the time as the frustration of a plot to take over Dublin. The subsequent abortive insurrection in June led to Camden's replacement as lord lieutenant by Lord Cornwallis, who expressed a high opinion of Castlereagh's talents and commitment to the British empire, though their joint plea to London for leniency towards the rebels was little regarded. Pelham, ready to resume office a year later, tried to get Castlereagh made chancellor of the Irish exchequer, with an English peerage as bait, but he resisted, and in October 1798 Pelham resigned his pretensions. Only the king clung to the notion that an Irishman should not hold the office, but yielded to Cornwallis's importunity.<br>
<br>As a supporter of Irish union with Great Britain, in the face of the French revolutionary and United Irish threats, Castlereagh was invited to London in December 1798 to discuss it. He secured cabinet support for his proposals for Irish representation at Westminster, and was appointed an English privy councillor on the 19th. In Dublin he carried two of three divisions on the proposals in January 1799, but conceded that opposition was still strong enough to warrant delay. Hitherto inclining to a protestant union, he concluded in February that the Irish Catholics must be conciliated; full relief would come later, but the Catholic clergy (as well as their Presbyterian counterparts) should be subsidized in token of this pledge. At the same time, he believed, compensation should be found for the Irish borough patrons who would lose their influence as a result of the reduction in the number of constituencies. His own family borough was one of the eighty-four intended to be bought out for a total of &pound;1,260,000. Peerages, promotions, and pensions were also held out as bait. This strategy, approved by Pitt and Dundas, was disliked by some members of the cabinet and by the king. Although Castlereagh was confident by June 1799 that it could be brought off, he was told in September, when he sought reassurance on measures of Catholic relief, that although it had government approval in principle there were reservations about future concessions, and that the king was likely to oppose them, so no promises should be made. The business of carrying the union proposals in the Dublin parliament, for which he obtained a vote of consent on principle on 5 February 1800, did something to melt the reserve which had so little recommended Castlereagh to the Irish. His speech that day was published. When the union was finally passed on 7 June 1800 he claimed to be proud of being less Irish and more English than hitherto. But Cornwallis and he threatened resignation soon afterwards when the English government attempted to diminish the promised rewards of union. As he declined to be among the thirty-eight creations or promotions in the peerage on the occasion, he agreed that his father, who would shortly become one of the Irish representative peers, might be promised the British peerage intended for him whenever he chose. Although, as he later reported, Pitt offered him the government of Bengal at this time (his father's maternal uncle had been governor of Bombay), he did not accept it. On 30 September 1800 he presented the cabinet with a memo on the expediency of offering further concessions to the Catholics. His proposals for subsidizing the sectarian clergy, and recognizing their hierarchy and educational establishments in the interest of replacing coercive by consensual government in Ireland, were accepted, but further measures of Catholic emancipation were shelved on 9 October. He returned to London in December to find that Lord Chancellor Loughborough had led a cabinet revolt against any further concessions. On 1 January 1801, the day the union came into operation, he protested to Pitt, who resigned office soon afterwards. He was duly blamed by the king for his influence over Pitt, who had at first promised to reintroduce Catholic emancipation in the future.<br>
<br>Castlereagh had intended to resign with Pitt, but the king's illness detained him in office. Addington, the new premier, offered him his Irish privy seal sinecure for life, but Castlereagh had proffered it to Pitt for Pelham's benefit several months before and now surrendered it to his successor as chief secretary, Charles Abbot, who took over from him on 21 May. In the meantime, while sitting for County Down at Westminster, Castlereagh continued to manage Irish business from there, and thus effectively established the Irish Office in London. He carried measures continuing martial law and the suspension of habeas corpus (detention without trial) in Ireland (12 and 16 March 1801): on the latter occasion he answered charges about his conduct in 1798 and was also named to the secret committee on Ireland. He was at this time a particular favourite of Pitt, sitting with him on the third row behind the Treasury bench, and urged him to resume the helm. But after Abbot succeeded him Castlereagh became depressed and took no further part that session, though he advised the ministry, who were deaf to his pleas, on how to make practical steps towards Irish Catholic relief. By the autumn he was well enough to go to Ireland and clarify union engagements for the benefit of Hardwicke, the new lord lieutenant. In October 1801 he was headhunted by Pitt's cousin Lord Grenville, who wished him to lead the opposition to Addington in the Commons, a role he immediately refused, for Pitt wished him to accept office under Addington. This tug of war probably induced the ambiguity of his speech on the peace preliminaries with France on 3 November 1801, which he welcomed very cautiously: he was in favour of the retention of Malta. He made himself serviceable to the ministry in committee and in full debate, not least on Irish questions, and although he communicated to Addington his reservations about the Anglo-French peace treaty in April, he justified it in debate on 14 May 1802. His contrary counsels on Ireland were muzzled when he was offered, and accepted on 17 July, the presidency of the Board of Control for India; once again the king disliked the appointment. In any case, the refusal of the Irish Catholic clergy to accept subsidy unless the laity obtained civil rights had effectively let him off the hook.<h2>
<a name="Castlereaghascabinetministerandhisinterludesoutofoffice18021812"></a>Castlereagh as cabinet minister and his interludes out of office, 1802&#150;1812</h2>Castlereagh's appointment to the India board had the ulterior motive of securing a reconciliation between Lord Wellesley and the East India Company directors, who were at loggerheads; in this he had the blessing of Pitt and Henry Dundas. Addington needed a right-hand man in the Commons, and in October Castlereagh joined the cabinet. In December Addington sent him to parley with Pitt at Bath, and as grounds for a resumption of hostilities with Bonaparte accumulated Castlereagh himself was eager to see Pitt back in office, and was again the premier's emissary to Pitt in April 1803. Pitt's indifference to this appeal led to Castlereagh's expression in debate of the difference between them (3 June 1803) on the renewal of war with France. He was unhappy, mauled by opposition in debate, and talked of for the Home Office or the Admiralty; the prescient Lord Malmesbury suggested that a diplomatic mission on the continent would suit him best. In fact his reservations about the Hardwicke administration in Ireland deterred him from aspiring to the Home Office, though he tried to conceal them when opposing the inquiry into the Dublin rising (11 August 1803) and supported coercive legislation for Ireland in December, when he was also useful in debate on the army estimates: his speech of 9 December was published. Temporarily estranged from Pitt, he again drew attention twice to their differences in debate, in which he featured increasingly as the ministry tottered, and was against further government overtures to him. His diplomacy came to the fore, both in negotiations with Persia and when he proposed parliamentary thanks to Lord Wellesley for his expansion of British interests in India (3 May), despite his own doubts about the expediency of the Maratha War: but their relations, never easy, subsequently deteriorated. On Pitt's return to power that month Addington sent Castlereagh to him in a bid to ensure the exclusion of Lord Grenville and the Foxite whigs from his ministry, in which Castlereagh retained his Indian office, giving up his seat at the Irish treasury board. He was kept busy in the house parrying opposition attacks on the cost and scope of Wellesley's warfare in India; he was thought likely to succeed him there, but had no such wish. He went on to reinstate himself in Pitt's good graces by support of his <span class="roman">Additional Force Bill</span>, notably on 3 June 1804 and 6 March 1805 when its repeal was moved. He had the first of many clashes, however, with William Wilberforce, being dissatisfied with a unilateral abolition of the slave trade and holding out for an international agreement (7 June 1804).<br>
<br>There were reports in October 1804 that Castlereagh would get the Foreign Office, but the only suggestion for him that Pitt heard with approval was Lord Camden's, in December, that he should become secretary of state for war and the colonies. Pitt's reconciliation with Addington intervened and received Castlereagh's encouragement, but he was uneasy when it was implemented. His reply to the opposition motion against war with Spain was languid (11 February), and he was impatiently heard when he opposed the censure of Melville's Admiralty administration on 8 April 1805. To perform well in debate he had to be goaded, as on 29 April, when he defended Pitt's reputation against Fox, and the next day, when he objected to Whitbread's attempt to exclude him from the committee of inquiry into Melville's conduct. Had he succeeded Melville at the Admiralty the ensuing rupture between Pitt and Addington might have been avoided, and this time the king would have approved the appointment, Castlereagh's being one of four names he recommended. In July, however, Pitt appointed him secretary for war and the colonies without displacing him, for the time being, at the Board of Control; but on seeking re-election, although returned unopposed in 1802, he yielded the field, on the twelfth day, to a candidate sponsored by Lady Downshire. The only consolation was Pitt's unwavering attentiveness. Although he did not resume his seat (for Boroughbridge, found for him by the Treasury) until 21 January 1806, he had meanwhile been preoccupied with the planning of the abortive Elbe expedition and a futile scheme to set fire to the French vessels at Boulogne. As Pitt lay dying, he and Lord Hawkesbury drafted the speech from the throne for the impending session and obtained Pitt's amendments. Castlereagh acted as spokesman for Pitt at Downing Street and in the house: he wished Pitt's friends to stay together, preferably in power, but these hopes were dashed. In his tribute to Pitt on 27 January 1806 he predicted that the policies for which Pitt had stood would revive. He had supposed that the Pittites might rally to Lord Grenville, but the latter's readiness to head a coalition ministry with the Foxite whigs and Addington, with whom he would not join, put paid to this. Deprived of office, he marked his hostility to the new administration on 3 March by opposing Lord Chancellor Ellenborough's sitting in cabinet.<br>
<br>Castlereagh was a consistent opponent of the military measures of William Windham, who had succeeded him at the War Office, though he showed more persistence than skill in debate on them and clung stubbornly to Pitt's plan. His main criticisms were of the neglect of voluntary corps and of limitation of enlistment to seven years. He was also an opposition spokesman on Indian and American matters, and on 12 June attempted a general denunciation of the government. He joined the opposition caucus of 4 July which ruled against acceptance of ministerial overtures to individual members of the opposition: he might have been more seriously tempted if Lord Wellesley, the first go-between recruited by ministers, had been prepared to consider him cabinet material. In subsequent overtures of July and October 1806 the Board of Control or the Royal Mint were the only bait. At the ensuing dissolution, having entrusted his Irish constituency to his half-brother Charles rather than risk another defeat, he was found another for Plympton Erle, a pocket borough belonging to one of his wife's family circle, Lord Mount Edgcumbe, which he held until 1812, despite the patron's initial reluctance to accommodate him. He was certainly not popular, but he was a businesslike spokesman for opposition and, as such, was approved of by the formerly disdainful George Canning, a fellow Ulsterman who had resented his intimacy with Pitt, and by Spencer Perceval, two of the leading lights of his party. In January 1807 he made a notably able attack on the army estimates, having previously dismissed ministerial hopes for peace with Bonaparte as chimerical. He was also capable of taking a line of his own, and not always a safe one, as shown by his insistence on countering the government's financial plan in February 1807 on the grounds of faulty data, while his colleagues preferred to question their validity. Typically, however, he persevered, and presented resolutions on 26 February which predicated, prophetically, a financial plan of nine years in preference to one of twenty. There was speculation that he was staking a claim to the exchequer, and this was indeed the office that Canning suggested for him when he was negotiating a possible merger with the Grenville administration in March 1807, but Castlereagh was reluctant. Grenville, while willing to take Castlereagh on board, had offered no prize for him other than the Board of Control or the government of Madras. Canning, setting his own sights higher, threw in the bait of the leadership of the house if Castlereagh was content to take the exchequer: this was on the assumption that Canning himself would be foreign secretary. When, however, Castlereagh showed an interest in resuming the war and colonial office Canning (who was by then prepared to take the Admiralty) approved. Castlereagh's last bid to restore the principle of military enlistment for life failed on 12 March 1807, but office for him was at hand as a consolation. On 15 April he expressed his approval of George III's dismissal of the ministry, basing it on the king's religious scruples, and he denigrated their record in office.<br>
<br>In the Portland administration Castlereagh resumed the War Office (25 March 1807), while Canning obtained the Foreign Office: the pair had agreed since December 1806 that the lead in the Commons should go to Perceval, and so it did. Illness prevented Castlereagh from introducing new military measures until 22 July, when he outflanked Windham by proposing enlistment either for seven years or for life, this being part of a package that doubled the battalions of each regiment by recruiting 28,000 men from the militia for regular service while supplying the militia deficit by ballot on a county basis. That done, he relapsed, reduced to a corpse-like appearance by internal haemorrhaging: his dispatch to the House of Lords with minor office was talked of. By 28 January 1808 he had recovered, moving the house's thanks for the destruction of the Danish fleet, which along with the preservation of the Swedish and Portuguese ones gave him better prospects in office. Hawkish by his own admission, he welcomed intervention in the Iberian peninsula, though he would have preferred to see the revival of Pitt's policy of a continental coalition against Bonaparte, which was at that time thwarted by the defection of Prussia and Russia. He also invoked Pitt when approving Catholic relief in principle, on 25 May 1808, though he thought agitation for it inopportune. When things went badly for Sir Arthur Wellesley and Sir John Moore in the Peninsula later that year he refused to be ruffled by his colleagues' dismay, and in January and February 1809 defended both their prosecution of the war in the field and the conduct of ministers, while calling for increased military exertion. His militia bills, legislation for which was completed in March 1809, were aimed at this, and he at the same time attempted, in vain, the rescue of the duke of York, commander-in-chief of the army, when his conduct was arraigned in debate. He himself faced an opposition motion alleging corruption (25 April 1809) over a promise made in 1805 to Lord Clancarty, an Irish friend, to procure a writership in India in order to improve his prospects of a seat in parliament. The promise was not fulfilled and the motion was defeated, after he had defended himself and withdrawn, by 216 to 167, while a motion of Canning's which exonerated Castlereagh, but saved the principle, was carried by 214 to 167. A month before, Canning had obtained the duke of Portland's secret promise that Castlereagh should be moved from the War Office at the end of the session. In May he successfully resisted one opposition motion against the Peninsular campaign as well as another implicating Perceval and himself in corrupt practice in the return of members on the Treasury interest for certain constituencies and in the subsequent unseating of one of them for political disloyalty. Canning, who was threatening to resign, found his colleagues anxious not to alienate Castlereagh, but was unable to suggest an alternative office for him, and was further stymied by the king's insistence that these machinations should not be disclosed to Castlereagh. Canning, who believed Lord Camden must have informed Castlereagh, was opposed to this concealment while Castlereagh was preparing the expedition to Walcheren under Lord Chatham. There were mixed reactions as more of his colleagues learned of the plot, but Castlereagh was told at the end of the session that his office would be remodelled. Several proposals for his future were put forward, which involved his taking a lead in the House of Lords, but a decision was to be postponed until the Walcheren expedition was over. On 3 September came the news that the expedition had failed in its objective of taking Antwerp, where Bonaparte was building a fleet: Canning, on being told by Portland that Castlereagh would be moved to another office, resigned, and Camden told the whole story to Castlereagh, who resigned next day, refusing any alternative. On 19 September he challenged Canning, whom he wounded in the thigh at the second exchange in a duel at dawn on Putney Heath two days later, losing only a coat button himself.<br>
<br>When Spencer Perceval replaced Portland as premier on 2 October 1809, Castlereagh refused office; privately he was appalled at the prospect of serving such shabby friends. He had sent a memorial to the king the day before complaining of Canning's unjustified treatment of his official conduct. The king returned a soft answer, and Canning felt obliged to publish an apologia addressed to Lord Camden, but could not escape hostile comment to the effect that he had launched the intrigue to promote his own ambitions by denigrating Castlereagh. The latter got his revenge on 23 January 1810 when he vindicated himself before a sympathetic house, and still more when he and four friends, by their silent votes, ensured a tiny majority for the opposition motion for inquiry into the failure of the Walcheren expedition. On 1 February he supported the vote of thanks to Wellington for his victory at Talavera. Canning commented that pity worked for Castlereagh, who claimed success for his military recruitment plans on 1 March. On the question of Lord Chatham's expeditionary fiasco he at first abstained, but on 5 March condemned him markedly for not consulting his cabinet colleagues. While some supposed that he would join opposition, there were reports of his return to office in mid-March. Certainly on the 26th he delivered a long speech defending the grounds for the failed expedition, and he and his small group of friends supported the government at the conclusion of the inquiry. This provoked an opposition bid to soften him by expunging the record of the charge of corruption against him the year before from the house's journals (18 May), but he snubbed it. As in May 1809 he remained hostile to parliamentary reform, and his windows were broken by protesters egged on by the propaganda of the radical Sir Francis Burdett. Nor did he consider the time yet ripe for Catholic relief; his speech of 25 May to that effect was published. On 4 September he rejected a proposal of the Admiralty from Perceval as it was part of an implausible package involving Canning and Lord Sidmouth which, he claimed, the public would not swallow.<br>
<br>The king's illness and the ensuing regency tested Castlereagh's political allegiance, and he steered an uncertain course. The ministry was impeded from making fresh overtures to him and to Sidmouth by Lord Wellesley's insistence on recruiting Canning as well. Castlereagh's kinship with the prince regent's favourite, Lord Yarmouth, complicated matters for him, and he wavered between initial support for restrictions on the regent's powers and criticism of the extent of the limits imposed. He consistently opposed two royal households, and therefore on 21 January 1811 tried in vain to lessen the queen's powers and transfer the major household officers to the prince regent, but subject to removal. He displayed his range in March and April when he criticized alterations to his military recruitment policies and urged interchange of militias between the mainland and Ireland. He praised successes in the Peninsular War. He also espoused the bullion question and, as one of the dissenting minority, condemned the committee report advocating the resumption of cash payments by the bank in two years' time, preferring to delay until the war was over; this speech of 8 May was published. Early in 1812 he was involved in a fresh ministerial bid to recruit him and other trimmers: Robert Peel was sent to him by Perceval with the prince regent's consent but found him reluctant to come in alone, and overtures to Sidmouth and the whig leaders had failed. On 4 February his usual temporizing support for Catholic relief, upon which he had stipulated for freedom of action in negotiations about his joining the government, was viewed with more cynicism than before, though even his critics drew attention to his good nature and conciliatory behaviour.<br>
<br>Lord Wellesley's resignation of the Foreign Office, which he had wanted Canning to have, preceded Castlereagh's acceptance of it on 19 February 1812. He had, if anything, expected to be offered the War Office: his only requirement, apart from freedom of action on the Catholic question (which, he had suggested to Lord Hertford on 27 June previous, should be declared a non-party issue by the regent), was the eviction of Lord Camden from his office. His revenge thus complete, Castlereagh aired his more liberal views on Catholic relief in debate on 27 February 1812, but at the same time criticized the whigs for making it a party question. He declined to support Grattan's motion for relief on 24 April because no securities were offered: he suggested that the Catholics should define their objectives. In other respects he was a reliable supporter of the ministry, and renewed his opposition to parliamentary reform on 8 May. It was Castlereagh who four days later moved the address for &#145;blood money&#146; for the assassinated Perceval's family, and broke down in so doing. When his colleagues attempted to recruit Canning and Lord Wellesley for the government, Castlereagh at first sent the regent his resignation, but retracted it on discovering that Lord Liverpool, not Wellesley, was to head the ministry, and that, in addition to retaining the Foreign Office, he would have the leadership of the Commons. Negotiations with Canning foundered because of his objections to this arrangement; he wished to share the management of government business in the house with Castlereagh, himself taking War Office questions, and to move Castlereagh to the exchequer, vacating the Foreign Office for himself. These were matters which Castlereagh chose not to divulge in debate on 21 May, when he led the ministerial opposition to a motion from the other side to strengthen the administration. The motion was successful, and Castlereagh failed in a petulant bid to confine the conveyance of the address to the prince regent to privy councillors. Attempts were made by the regent to sweeten him to the recruitment of Canning, but Castlereagh stood aside until his colleagues informed the regent that they had decided to abandon the attempt. The latter turned to Lord Moira to form an administration, but the venture failed when it became clear that Canning's friends wished to keep him and Castlereagh apart by sending the latter to the Lords; Castlereagh resented their interference, and Canning himself was to rue it. It fell to Castlereagh to inform the house of Liverpool's resumption of office on 8 June and to shrug off opposition bids to revive the issue. His competence as leader of the house was being called into question, particularly after he had announced the revocation of the orders in council on foreign trading later that month after vehemently opposing Brougham's motion for their repeal a week before, and lamely supported Canning's motion for Catholic relief (22 June) after declaring it a non-party question on the 10th. Government supporters who believed Canning was a necessary acquisition to preserve the ministry regarded Castlereagh as the chief obstacle to their hopes. On 17 July Liverpool met with them both. Castlereagh was willing to exchange the Foreign Office for the exchequer, but would not cede the lead of the house to Canning, which the latter wished at least to share, for the same reason he had steadily resisted ongoing bids by the regent to accept a peerage. A further bid to fix a basis for negotiation in the next few days failed, despite Castlereagh's willingness to concede War Office matters in the house to Canning, when the latter gave up, suspecting that Castlereagh was not in effect surrendering his superiority.<br>
<br>Despite a shaky start Castlereagh persisted in his attempts to vindicate his leadership of the house after the 1812 election. Though elected for Clitheroe as security, he had retrieved his seat for County Down with the compliance of Lord Downshire, and went on to retain it until the death of his father in 1821. By the end of the first session he had done much to recover his reputation. He committed himself to Catholic relief and had a say in the <span class="roman">Relief Bill</span>, as finally drafted. He went so far as to condemn the Orange lodges in Ireland on 29 June, and was the only minister in the Commons who took this line. He also managed the renewal of the East India Company charter, and took the regent's part against Whitbread's championship of the princess of Wales's grievances. In short, he left a gap not readily supplied when on 31 December 1813 he left England on his first foreign engagement, accompanied by his wife. She gradually developed a taste for a new role as a glamorous accessory to her husband's international importance.<h2>
<a name="Castlereaghasforeignsecretaryandleaderofthehouse18121822"></a>Castlereagh as foreign secretary and leader of the house, 1812&#150;1822</h2>Castlereagh was fortunate in his moment of obtaining the Foreign Office seals&#151;28 February 1812. The Peninsular campaign was in successful impetus. His first task was to move subsidies to Portugal and Sicily in March. This foreshadowed the revival of Pitt's system of continental alliances in the so-called fourth coalition, the construction of which, begun in June 1812, enabled Castlereagh to justify rejection of recent French peace overtures in the house. Even so, in the ensuing negotiations to recruit Canning for the government he was conditionally willing to surrender the Foreign Office. In February 1813 he obtained the house's concurrence in hostilities with the USA. In November he obtained fresh subsidies for the allies in Europe, who now had the upper hand over Bonaparte. He disliked the terms of peace proposed by the allies, and the cabinet sent him informally to the allied headquarters at Basel and the ensuing conference at Chatillon, with a mission to the prince of Orange <i>en route</i>. This tour revealed allied differences, but Castlereagh first made his mark as a diplomat in attempting to compose them. At this point a temporary success of Bonaparte's put him on the defensive, and he rescued the alliance by renewing it in the treaty of Chaumont on 1 March. He was at Dijon with the Austrians when Bonaparte abdicated. He went on as plenipotentiary to Paris, where the peace preliminaries had been signed on 30 March 1814. These obtained his signature on 11 April, but he made it clear that he believed that Bonaparte still represented a threat. When he returned and presented this to the Commons on 6 June, he was the hero of the hour. He was awarded the Garter that month: though a commoner, he received it in order that he could, on his subsequent travels, be commissioned to confer the like honour on the prince of Orange and the Austrian emperor. The only criticism came from Wilberforce on 29 June, when Castlereagh explained his failure to win unconditional allied support for an international ban on the slave trade. On 1 July he delivered the last of his encomia on the returning Wellington. As leader of the house he also announced the pensioning of the princess of Wales out of the country, and called for moderation of hasty demands for the removal of wartime restrictions on civil liberty.<br>
<br>Castlereagh returned to the continent in the summer of 1814 on a series of missions: to make peace with the Americans at Ghent, to establish a Dutch monarchy of the Netherlands at Brussels, and then to travel, via Switzerland, to Vienna, where the powers met in September to implement the peace preliminaries. Protracted negotiations, during which he played off France and Austria against Russia and Prussia, detained him there until agreement was wrested from the latter states by a treaty between Britain, France, and Austria on 3 January 1815. Even so, he had to sacrifice some of his objectives, notably that of an independent Poland. He arrived home via Paris, where he parleyed with the restored Bourbon monarch, on 3 March 1815, before ratification, and a week later informed the house of Bonaparte's escape from Elba, which he had feared all along. He was meanwhile a stoical spectator while the windows of his London house were broken by anti-cornlaw rioters, but defended the use of the military to protect parliament. On 16 March he announced the government's intention to prevent the restoration of Bonaparte in France, and delivered a four-hour speech on his peace negotiations four days later. On 7 April he justified the reinforcement of the armed services to meet the new threat to European security. He resisted Whitbread's bid for a negotiation with Bonaparte, who had made an overture to him for an Anglo-French armistice, which he referred to the allies and later disclosed to the house. On 11 April he had carried the Anglo-American treaty of Ghent, and on 23 April the treaty of Vienna, which had been signed on 25 March. He carried a series of measures renewing alliances and subsidies and embodying militia to confront Bonaparte (25 May), and in June was able to move the thanks of the house for victory at Waterloo. Domestic questions were more troublesome: his coolly defiant stance in debate, where he shouldered the burden of post-war discontent, made him a focus for opposition and popular incrimination, though in Ireland his principled support for Catholic relief conciliated its champions.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1815 Castlereagh went back to Paris to negotiate, in congress, a new peace treaty and renew the quadruple alliance. This, designed to contain France in the future, was achieved on 20 November, and he had a starring role in it, not least in preventing the allies from inflicting punitive measures on France. His father obtained the Irish marquessate of Londonderry in January 1816. In February he vindicated in the house the equilibrium attained in Europe, criticized the tendency of opposition to denigrate the allies as reactionaries, and upheld the maintenance of a large military establishment in peacetime. He particularly objected to Brougham's championship of the suppressed Spanish liberals, which he saw as an instance of unwarranted interference in the affairs of other countries. He carried the peace treaty on 20 February: his aim was a concert of Europe sustained by open diplomacy. After a brief illness he found the house far more unmanageable in peacetime than in war: the army estimates were strongly challenged and the renewal of the property tax defeated. He had to lecture the house on &#145;an ignorant impatience to be relieved from taxation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 1</span>, 32, 45) and deliver a similar sermon to about fifty country gentlemen at his office in order to secure the <span class="roman">Civil List Regulation Bill</span> he brought in on 3 May. By its separation of royal from state expenditure, this sought to diminish the outcry about the royal family's cost to the nation, to which he had previously alerted the regent. Subsequently that session he had more success with government measures, and although the standard criticism that, as Byron mocked, he was guilty of &#145;the strange displays / Of that odd string of words, all in a row, / Which none divine, and everyone obeys&#146;  (Byron, <span class="smallcap">IX</span>.49) continued, it was widely acknowledged that the government would be the worse for his transfer to the Lords: the home secretary, Lord Sidmouth, whose measures gave Castlereagh so much trouble, sat there.<br>
<br>The pressure on Castlereagh was, however, relentless in the 1817 session, when he faced opposition attacks on legislation against sedition and the suspension of habeas corpus; on public expenditure, despite undoubted retrenchments; and on commercial depression. His corpulent and gouty appearance was noted, while his workload was described as &#145;enough to destroy the health of Hercules&#146;  (W. Wellesley to C. Bagot, 4 May 1817, Bagot MSS, Cumbria AS). On 11 July he furiously rebuffed an attempt by Brougham to discredit him on the old charge of cruelty in Ireland during the rising of 1798. His good standing with the regent, enhanced by his arrangement of Princess Charlotte's marriage to Prince Leopold, was thought to make Lord Liverpool jealous, though the princess refused to have Lady Castlereagh as lady-in-waiting, and it was her husband that Castlereagh counted on influencing. The princess's death in childbed late in 1817 disposed of further speculation. It spelt more trouble for Castlereagh in the 1818 session, when he had to swallow reduced grants to three of the regent's brothers as they married in competition to produce a new heir to the throne, following keen opposition. Previously he had repealed the suspension of habeas corpus, but renewed the secret committee on internal unrest and assured indemnity to government agents. He also placated Wilberforce somewhat by producing an Anglo-Spanish treaty on the slave trade, followed by others with Portugal and the Netherlands. Parliamentary reform remained out of the question for him; nor did he regard the plight of the needy as a government matter. After attending the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in the recess of 1818 he was able to report the pacification of Europe, with the allied evacuation of France, to the new parliament in February 1819. His worst problem in the house resulted from the death of Queen Charlotte, and this he solved by halving the regent's income. The opposition, under George Tierney's leadership, harassed him also on the resumption of cash payments by the bank, which he had steadily opposed but now consented to legislate for, and on criminal law reform, which he opposed while favouring prison reform. In one of his ablest speeches he reduced Tierney's censure motion of 18 May to a partisan attempt to overthrow the government. His opposition to the emancipation of the Spanish American colonies was made plain in his promotion of the bill against foreign enlistment a month later. He also supported a <span class="roman">Charitable Foundation Bill</span> framed to meet Brougham's exposure of abuses in charitable educational institutions.<br>
<br>The suppression of the radical meeting at St Peter's Fields, Manchester (the Peterloo massacre), in 1819 led to a stormy session in parliament during which Castlereagh introduced legislation to outlaw such assemblies, prevent training of dissidents, and seize arms. For this he was the target of abuse from political opponents and radical populists. His comment was &#145;I feel no wrath against the people, I am only doing my duty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 1</span>, 41, 3 Dec 1819, 702). The substance of these speeches was published <i>en bloc</i>. To ensure support he made some concessions, and even granted that there was a case for disfranchising the most notorious rotten boroughs, such as Grampound (14 December), though he believed that each case should be treated on its merits. On the death of George III in January 1820, Castlereagh seemed well placed to take a leading part during the reign of George IV, but radicalism found a new focus in support of the claims of the king's estranged wife, Caroline, who returned to England in June 1820, while George's abandonment of the Hertfords in favour of the Conynghams as intimates damaged his standing at court; this difficulty was aggravated by a quarrel between Lady Castlereagh and Lady Conyngham. Castlereagh sent his half-brother Charles to the continental congresses at Troppau and Laibach late in 1820, guided by a state paper of 5 May, aimed at preserving British interests in the face of the holy alliance promoted by the tsar, who wished to instate a mutual allied guarantee against political revolutions. The allies' readiness to countenance such intervention in the affairs of Naples stung him into rebuke in January 1821.<br>
<br>On the death of his father on 6 April 1821 Castlereagh became second marquess of Londonderry and <i>custos</i> of that county, of which he had been a governor since 1805. As an Irish peer he could no longer sit for an Irish constituency, and he transferred on 28 April to a seat for Orford on Lord Hertford's interest. He remained at home to face the repercussions in the house of the royal marital breakdown, a subject highly distasteful to him. He was relieved when the bill of pains and penalties against Caroline was abandoned, and her death in 1821 closed that chapter, during which he had been extensively lampooned. Meanwhile he had accompanied the king to Dublin and to Hanover, whereupon he was awarded a GCH (civil) and was privately regarded as both the king's and Lord Liverpool's choice to succeed the latter as premier. Castlereagh was not keen, however, to promote the up and coming Robert Peel until the latter accepted the Home Office, which did not constitute a threat to him: it seems his sole remaining ambition was for the premiership. The wear and tear of leading the house had taken its toll on him. In his last speech on foreign affairs, on 21 February 1822, he had to take note of the rift between Britain and her reactionary allies. In his last published speeches of 15 February and 29 April 1822 he disclaimed government responsibility for agricultural distress. In the recess that followed he had a breakdown which threatened his mental stability, and it became evident that the anxieties previously kept under rein were now overtaking him. One of them allegedly related to blackmail, after a chance encounter with a hostile transvestite male who deliberately attempted to compromise him, but no confirmation exists for the authenticity of this or of homosexual vagaries imputed to him  (see Hyde, <span class="italic">Strange Death of Lord Castlereagh</span>). Evading the attentions of his doctor, who had removed the pistols he had carried since the Cato Street conspiracy to assassinate the entire cabinet in 1820, as well as his razors, he cut his throat with a penknife in his dressing room at his county retreat in Kent, North Cray Place, on 12 August 1822. The inquest pointed to the onset of a state of mental delusion, of which several of his colleagues were aware. On 20 August, after his hearse had been reviled by some malicious spectators, he was buried next to Pitt in Westminster Abbey. He had become a fellow of the Royal Society on 11 November 1802 and an elder of Trinity House in 1817: but in a life short of leisure, his favourite pursuit was gardening. In his will he left the Mount Stewart estate in co. Down to his half-brother Sir Charles William Stewart, who succeeded to the marquessate, and the rest to his wife. He provided for all his household servants at North Cray.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>Shelley's lines on Castlereagh in <span class="italic">The Mask of Anarchy</span> (1819) were some of the most vicious in the history of British political satire:<blockquote>
<div>I met Murder on the way&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>He had a mask like Castlereagh&#151;.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Attacks on him were also made by Byron, Southey, Moore, and Cobbett. But pity again worked for him once the circumstances of his death became known. Even opponents then paid tribute to the courtesy and tact, personal courage and integrity which informed his business and diplomatic abilities, and to his good humour and amiability off the stage once he had overcome a certain social reserve. The want of ornament and coherence in his speeches was admitted on all sides, but oratorical fashions changed, and the plain, factual manner he preferred was to be used effectively by Robert Peel. While he regarded himself as a mere disciple of Pitt, his post-war foreign policy, despite the amendments of his successor, Canning, was firmly based on an objective of European consensus, which made for a long-lasting peace on a war-weary continent. In this respect he became a model of diplomacy and statesmanship for a century. The publication of his state papers by his half-brother (1848&#150;53) exacted admiration for his political and diplomatic clear-headedness and resourcefulness, and exonerated him from many then prevalent criticisms. Nineteenth-century liberals thought him too tender to the restored monarchies and disrespectful of subjugated nations, but he was a ready critic of the excessive zeal of the holy alliance, just as he had sought to moderate Wellesley's empire-building in India as colonial secretary and been anxious not to saddle Britain with most of the overseas colonies seized in wartime. These favourable qualifications have surfaced in twentieth-century biographical profiles by Sir Charles Wheeler, J. A. R. Marriott, Ione Leigh, and Wendy Hinde. His diplomatic powers, as analysed by Henry Kissinger in <span class="italic">A World Restored</span>, adumbrated its author's own career. As one of the first of a galaxy of statesmen to emerge from the Anglo-Irish union, of which Castlereagh remained a firm advocate, he was remarkable, given his Ulster background, for his support of Catholic relief, and saw that the long delay in granting this, during which he had himself been hesitant for political reasons, was bound to jeopardize the success of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>.<br>
