<span class="headword">Lowther <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thynne]</span>,  Katherine</span>, Viscountess Lonsdale  (1653&#150;1713), <span class="occ">electoral patron</span>, was born on 21 September 1653 at Caus Castle, Shropshire, the daughter of Sir Henry Frederick Thynne, first baronet (1614&#150;1680), landowner, of Kempsford, Gloucestershire, and his wife, the Hon. Mary (<i>b</i>. 1618), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6483/', "Thomas Coventry, first Baron Coventry of Aylesborough")</script>.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1674 Katherine married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17111/', "John Lowther (1655&#150;1700)")</script>, of Lowther, Westmorland. They had five sons (two of whom died young), and nine daughters (four of whom survived her). Their first child, Mary, was born at Drayton, Staffordshire, a residence of Katherine's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27424/', "Thomas Thynne, created Viscount Weymouth")</script> in 1682. On 30 November 1675 John Lowther succeeded his grandfather as second baronet. There followed several years of living in London, where several more children were born. However, after 1680, all but two of her children were born at Lowther.<br>
<br>The Lowthers had much political influence in the north-west: Lady Lowther's husband served as MP for Westmorland, with a break of only one short parliament, from 1677 until his elevation to the peerage as Viscount Lonsdale on 28 May 1696. He also served in high office from 1689 to 1694. His retirement in 1694 was interrupted by the illness of his wife following the birth of his son, Henry, and the death of a daughter, Dorothy, which necessitated a trip to Bath and an extended stay in London to aid her recovery. Lonsdale returned to high office in 1699 and was still in office when he died on 10 July 1700.<br>
<br>Lady Lonsdale's most immediate problem was her husband's will, Lord Weymouth fearing &#145;a good deal of trouble in the execution&#146; of it  (Weymouth to Lady Lonsdale, 21 July 1700, Lonsdale MSS, D/Lons/L1/1/44). She certainly sought advice from Weymouth and her husband's cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37694/', "Sir John Lowther, second baronet (bap. 1642, d. 1706)")</script>, of Whitehaven, on estate matters, and on the education of her son Henry. Lady Lonsdale, however, made it a guiding rule of her conduct to act as her late husband would have done, which included scrupulously following the instructions left in his will. She also became the head of the Lonsdale political interest during her eldest son's minority. By late August 1700 she was living in Chelsea, seeing no one but her &#145;brothers and sisters and some particular relations&#146;  (James Lowther to Sir John Lowther, 29 Aug 1700, Lonsdale MSS, D/Lons/W2/2/3). Initially she was advised by her brother Weymouth to stand neutral in the impending by-election for Westmorland, but she seems to have realized that this would weaken her interest. She then seems to have taken advice from Sir John Lowther, who was keen for the Lowther/Howard (earl of Carlisle) interest to thwart the Musgraves, even though Musgrave was a political ally of her brother Weymouth. In the general election of January 1701 she was &#145;resolute to do as my Lord would have done had he been alive&#146;  (James Lowther to Sir John Lowther, 5 April 1701, Lonsdale MSS, D/Lons/W2/2/4). In December 1702 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37692/', "James Lowther")</script> reported to his father Sir John that &#145;my Lady Lonsd[ale] calls herself a Whig&#146;  (James Lowther to Sir John Lowther, 1 Dec 1702, Lonsdale MSS, D/Lons/W2/2/5).<br>
<br>In June 1705 a family crisis erupted when Lady Lonsdale's daughter Barbara was &#145;clandestinely married&#146; to the Catholic Thomas Howard of Corby, Cumberland. This necessitated a series of delicate negotiations covering the security of the bride's portion and the children, not completed until September 1706. The viscountess's political sympathies were shown again in November 1705 when, according to Bishop Nicolson of Carlisle, the young Viscount Lonsdale was &#145;brought into&#146; the house of Lords by the whig Lord Wharton without the tory Lord Weymouth's being given notice, even though Lady Lonsdale had dined with her brother the evening before.<br>
<br>Lady Lonsdale was vital in establishing James Lowther as knight of the shire for Cumberland in the 1708 election, now that his father had died. He was confident in expecting that the interest of Lonsdale and Carlisle would carry the election for him, but he was careful to approach her before taking any action. Again, in 1710, she promised to send orders to her bailiffs to campaign for James Lowther once anybody stirred in the county.<br>
<br>Katherine Lonsdale died in London on 7 January 1713, and was buried in Lowther on the 28th, &#145;none invited formally &hellip; yet great crowds&#146;  (&#145;Nicolson's diaries&#146;, pt 5, 61). Her will left tokens to her three sons, to three of her daughters, and to her sons-in-law, including Sir John Wentworth, whose wife (Lady Lonsdale's daughter Mary), had died in 1706. Her daughter Barbara was not mentioned.<br>
