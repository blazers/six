<span class="headword">Jaques,  John</span>  (1823&#150;1898), <span class="occ">sports and games manufacturer</span>, was born in London, the only son of John Jaques (1795&#150;1877), an ivory- and wood-turner of Leather Lane in the City of London, and his wife, Ann. In adolescence he was apprenticed into the family firm of T. and J. Jaques, founded in 1795 by his grandfather, Thomas Jaques (1765&#150;1844), which moved its headquarters in 1838 from Leather Lane to 102 Hatton Garden, London. Eventually the firm was renamed Jaques &amp; Son.<br>
<br>The firm's fortunes were built on handcrafted bowling woods, false teeth made from hippopotamus ivory, and elegant chess sets of a new standard design, named after a leading Victorian player, Howard Staunton. The younger John Jaques expanded the product range to include a variety of indoor games, demonstrating his ingenuity as an inventor: <i>Happy Families</i>, <i>Tiddly-Winks</i>, <i>Ludo</i>, and <i>Snakes and Ladders</i>, staples of domestic entertainment for well over a century.<br>
<br>The most important change came in 1851 when Jaques exhibited a croquet set at the Great Exhibition in London and became the game's most influential popularizer. During the next two decades croquet spread extremely rapidly, not least in British India, proving ideal for a newly affluent upper middle class seeking to play gentle games on private lawns; it also offered a very useful, socially controlled and partly chaperoned addition to the marriage mart. Jaques codified the rules in what long remained the standard work, his <span class="italic">Croquet, the Laws and Regulations of the Game</span>, first published in 1864. He married Harriet Ingram (1823&#150;1898), the daughter of Nathaniel Cooke, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>; they had six daughters and two sons, one of whom continued the innovatory traditions of the firm. John Jaques was made a freeman of the City of London in 1869 and played a prominent role in one of the City livery companies, the Turners. John Jaques died on 3 April 1898 at his home, Hillside, Duppas Hill, Croydon, Surrey. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>By that time the business had already passed into the control of his second son, also <a name="cosubject_56202"></a><span class="headword">John Jaques</span>  (1862&#150;1937), <span class="occ">sports and games manufacturer</span>, who was born on 3 September 1862 at 4 Caroline Place, St Pancras, London. He joined the firm in 1884 and was a keen sportsman and an all-round athlete. He maintained the firm's base in domestic games but directed output towards other burgeoning middle-class sports after croquet declined in the later 1870s, after the rapid spread of lawn tennis. That sport was catered for by the firm, together with cricket, archery, football, and badminton, which experienced an Edwardian surge in popularity. Croquet also revived in this sporting boom, as did bowls. John Jaques responded to that by introducing mechanized production of bowling woods, and Jaques's bowls became the game's standard for a long time. There were also additions to the range of board games, including a short-lived response to the 1890s bicycling boom, <i>Wheeling</i>, which involved moving lead figures of cyclists along a stylized route through the Thames valley.<br>
<br>In the longer term the most significant of Jaques's innovations was <i>Gossima</i>, later renamed <i>Ping-Pong</i>. It was an indoor game, playable on dinner tables. It boomed in the early 1900s, although Jaques's product soon found a rival in the similar <i>Table Tennis</i>, produced by other manufacturers with slightly different rules. It then lost popularity rapidly until it re-emerged after the First World War as a staple of youth club provision.<br>
<br>In 1901 Jaques married Mimie Constable Roberts, who died in the following year giving birth to a son, John Jaques. In 1917 he married Irene Amy Dodgson, the niece of Lewis Carroll; they had nine children, and she survived him. The firm's integrity in a fickle and competitive market was strengthened by incorporation as a private limited liability company in 1899 when John became a salaried managing director at &pound;400 a year; in 1912 outside investors were allowed in but never to such an extent that Jaques family control was threatened. John Jaques died on 14 January 1937 at his home, Croft Cottage, 5 Forest Road, Branksome Park, near Bournemouth. He left his descendants a very well-established firm, combining innovation and a strong product line rooted in the quality of its Victorian staples.<br>
