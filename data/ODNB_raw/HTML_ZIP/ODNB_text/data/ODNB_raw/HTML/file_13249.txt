<span class="headword">Highmore,  Joseph</span>  (1692&#150;1780), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 13 June 1692 in the parish of St James Garlickhythe in the City of London, the third son of Edward Highmore, a coal merchant, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tull. From 1702 to 1704 he attended Merchant Taylors' School in London, and from 1707 trained as a lawyer, during which time, if his contemporary George Vertue is to be believed, he acquired a self-confident, perhaps even opinionated manner; &#145;the Natural practice of the law gives most men a good Voluable speech with a Stedfast assurance of which he has benefited in that particular. &amp; turns it well to his advantage&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.29). His schooling and clerkship would have provided him with a good solid education. That he was proficient in Latin, for example, is evident from his prose translation of Isaac Hawkins Browne's poem <span class="italic">De animi immortalitate</span> (1766). Highmore was, however, determined to pursue a career as an artist, no doubt in emulation of his uncle <a name="cosubject_13249"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Highmore</span>  (1660&#150;1720), <span class="occ">the serjeant-painter</span>. Thomas Highmore was born in London on 22 June 1660, one of the two sons of Abraham Highmore and the cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13248/', "Nathaniel Highmore, MD")</script>. He was apprenticed to Leonard Cotes for seven years in 1674, and became serjeant-painter in April 1703. In 1689 he took on as an apprentice his kinsman Sir James Thornhill, who succeeded him in the office of serjeant-painter. Thomas Highmore died in London on 8 March 1720. Curiously, Joseph was not apprenticed to his uncle Thomas (indeed he never trained directly under a master), but during his clerkship he attended the anatomical lectures of William Cheselden and Sir Godfrey Kneller's drawing academy. One of his earliest known portraits, of the ivory carver David le Marchand (<i>c</i>.1723; NPG), reveals Highmore's debt to Kneller at his most vivacious. In 1715, freed from the law, he established a portrait-painting practice, and on 28 May 1716 he married Susanna Hiller (1689/90&#150;1750) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74064/', "Highmore, Susanna")</script>], with whom he had two children, <a href="#cosubject_13245">Anthony [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Susanna. In 1724 the Highmores moved from the parish of St Swithin in the City of London to a house on the north side of the more affluent Lincoln's Inn Fields, an indication of Highmore's professional success and his social aspirations. From 1725 he is listed as a member of the masonic lodge of the Swan, Greenwich, whose master was the great English baroque artist Sir James Thornhill; this shows a certain professional canniness on Highmore's part. As he appears to have had little interest in societies or clubs, his association with the freemasons (he was junior grand warden of the grand lodge in 1727 and a regular attendee throughout the 1730s) cannot be underestimated.<br>
<br>Highmore made two foreign excursions, first in 1732 to the Low Countries, and second in 1734 to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of artists associated with the Acad&eacute;mie Royale. During both journeys he made a particular study of the work of Sir Peter Paul Rubens, an artist he greatly admired and whom, in technique at least, he attempted to emulate. Highmore's clientele came predominantly from the wealthy gentry or professional middle classes. Unusually among artists of the period, he did not use students or drapery painters; as he proudly wrote: &#145;I do every thing my self, which I believe is not true of one painter in England besides&#146;  (letter to James Harris, 23 March 1741, Hants. RO, 9M73/G482/10). This explains why full-length portraits by Highmore are rare (a notable exception being <span class="italic">The Family of Sir Lancelot Lee</span>, 1736; Wolverhampton Art Gallery) and why he was particularly known during his lifetime for small-scale group portraits or &#145;conversations&#146;. Highmore's posthumous reputation suffered until the latter half of the twentieth century due to the misattribution of his work, particularly the twelve canvasses of 1743&#150;4 illustrating scenes from Samuel Richardson's novel <span class="italic">Pamela</span> (1740&#150;41) (Tate collection, FM Cam., and the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia) and his group portrait <span class="italic">Mr Oldham and his Guests</span> (<i>c</i>.1735&#150;45; Tate collection). The latter was from at least 1828 until 1949 ascribed to William Hogarth. The <span class="italic">Pamela</span> series was created to capitalize on the extraordinary popularity of Richardson's novel through the sale of engravings and by publicizing the display of the originals in Highmore's studio. Afterwards Highmore became an intimate of Richardson, whose portrait he painted several times and through whom he was recommended to Dr Edward Young, whose portrait he executed in 1754. <span class="italic">Mr Oldham</span> is in style and composition unique among works by Highmore's contemporaries, and should therefore be viewed as one of the most innovative portraits of the early Georgian period.<br>
<br>Highmore was a rather aloof figure among his professional peers, preferring instead the company of literary men such as Richardson, Hawkins Browne, James Harris, John Hawkesworth, and William Duncombe. In 1746 he presented the history painting <span class="italic">Hagar and Ishmael</span> to the Foundling Hospital in London and was subsequently made a governor. In 1761 he retired to Canterbury with his daughter and son-in-law, the Revd John Duncombe. Portraits from this period are rare, but throughout his retirement Highmore published books and articles on a variety of subjects. These include <span class="italic">Observations on a pamphlet entitled &#145;Christianity not founded on argument&#146;</span> (1765), <span class="italic">Essays, Moral, Religious, and Miscellaneous</span> (1766), and a discourse on colouring published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1778). This last highlights what Highmore perceives as the inadequate technical training offered at the newly established Royal Academy. In other published work he provocatively defends his idol Rubens against what he describes as &#145;the prejudice of connoisseurship&#146;  (Highmore, &#145;Remarks&#146;, 353). Certainly these late publications reveal that Highmore's confidence in stating his own opinions and inclination for lively debate, attributes that Vertue had observed early in his career, remained with him throughout his life. Highmore died in Canterbury on 3 March 1780 and was buried in the cathedral.<br>

<a name="cosubject_13245"></a><span class="headword">Anthony Highmore</span>  (1718&#150;1799), <span class="occ">draughtsman</span>, was born on 26 September 1718 in the parish of St Swithin, London. He was a pupil under his father, with whom he worked until about 1755. On 23 April 1740 he married at Old Brampton, Derby, Anna Maria, the daughter of the Revd Seth Ellis, with whom he had fifteen children, one of whom was the legal writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13246/', "Anthony Highmore")</script>, who was born in London. Highmore occasionally painted portraits and topographical views. His five views of Hampton Court were engraved by J. Tinney. In 1755 he painted a copy of a portrait by Sir Godfrey Kneller of William III for the Mansion House, York. After his father retired to Canterbury in 1761, Highmore gave up painting and turned his attention to the study of theology. He died in Canterbury on 3 October 1799 in his eighty-second year.<br>
