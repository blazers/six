<span class="headword">Zulueta,  Francis <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Francisco Maria Jos&eacute;]</span>  de</span>  (1878&#150;1958), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 12 September 1878 in the Spanish embassy in London. His father, Don Pedro Juan de Zulueta, was a member of the Spanish diplomatic service; his mother, Laura Mary, daughter of Sir Justin Sheil, at one time British minister in Persia. Although a Spaniard by birth, and a cousin of Cardinal Merry del Val, he was only one-quarter of Spanish blood: his father was on one side Scottish, descended in the female line from Brodie M'Ghie Willcox, one of the founders of the P. &amp; O. Steam Navigation Company. The Zuluetas, a Basque family, settled in Cadiz in the eighteenth century, had left Spain on account of their liberal opinions and later established a business in London where for much of the nineteenth century they served as the agents of the Spanish government. Don Pedro felt himself so much at home that in order to remain permanently in London he resigned from the Spanish diplomatic service. His son regarded himself as British rather than Spanish.<br>
<br>Zulueta was educated at Beaumont College, Berkshire, and the Oratory School, Edgbaston, and went with an open scholarship to New College, Oxford, where he was placed in the first class in classical moderations (1899), <i>literae humaniores</i> (1901), and jurisprudence (1902). He was elected to a prize fellowship at Merton in 1902, won the Vinerian law scholarship in 1903, and was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1904. In 1907 he returned to New College as a tutorial fellow and from 1912 to 1917 was All Souls reader in Roman law.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914 Zulueta felt himself so closely identified with Britain that he became naturalized, obtained a commission in the Worcestershire regiment, and served in France. On his return to Oxford in 1919 he was appointed to the regius chair of civil law at All Souls, which he held until 1948. In 1915 he married Marie Louise (<i>d</i>. 1970), daughter of Henry Alexander Lyne Stephens, of Grove House, Roehampton; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39880/', "Sir Philip Francis de Zulueta")</script>.<br>
<br>A first-rate classical scholar, Zulueta had also the good fortune to be one of the earliest members of the seminar of Paul Vinogradoff, the first to be established on continental lines in Oxford. He always admitted his deep indebtedness to Vinogradoff and the methods of research inculcated by him. The fruit of this work was an essay, contributed in 1909 to Vinogradoff's <span class="italic">Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History</span>, &#145;Patronage in the later empire&#146;. Thereafter he published much less than his contemporaries desired and expected. He became in truth too learned to see opportunities for originality in a well-tilled field; and his scepticism in matters of legal scholarship not only led him to leave questions open which others might have answered, but to entertain a radical and very un-Catholic disbelief in natural law. He was out of tune with the dominant school of Romanistic research, then devoted to the search for interpolations in the corpus juris, which he regarded as piling hypothesis upon hypothesis and encouraging anyone who practised it not to admit the unsoundness of any theory he had once adopted. He is also reported to have said to a younger friend, &#145;Don't read, or you won't write&#146;. It was characteristic that much of his most valuable work is to be found in his bibliographical contributions to the <span class="italic">Journal of Egyptian Archaeology</span>. One of his colleagues once likened him to a person with a big bunch of keys: he might not be able to tell you what you wanted to know but he would certainly be able to tell you where to find it. His relative unproductiveness was perhaps partly due to an unfortunate occasion, during his period of teaching at New College, when a number of undergraduates, finding their stock of combustible materials running out, burnt the papers he had prepared for a forthcoming book. This rankled, though in the end he came to think that the enforced rewriting had resulted in a much better book. However surprising it may have been to those who knew him later, he was at that time rather unpopular, being less able than subsequently to control a naturally quick temper.<br>
<br>In 1927 Zulueta edited for the Selden Society Vacarius's <span class="italic">Liber pauperum</span>. But he will be best-known to ordinary students by three most useful works: his little edition of the <span class="italic">Digest</span> titles on ownership and possession (1922) for use by BCL candidates, his <span class="italic">Roman Law of Sale</span> (1945), and his edition of the <span class="italic">Institutes of Gaius</span>, of which the text and translation appeared in 1946 and the commentary in 1953. In all these he displayed a conciseness of utterance which is often disconcerting, not only to the elementary student, but which on more diligent perusal discloses the products of his profound erudition.<br>
<br>In lecturing Zulueta believed in systematic exposition which did not perhaps show him at his best. Temperamentally he was better fitted to the more explosive method appropriate to informal instruction or to revision lectures in which he could assume a general knowledge of the subject and needed only to draw attention to interesting points which had probably been neglected.<br>
<br>A devout Roman Catholic, Zulueta actively supported the Oxford University Catholic Association and the local branch of the Society of St Vincent de Paul. His religious convictions made him effective in helping Polish refugees during the Second World War although they were not so exclusive as to preclude his doing just as much for Jewish and other refugees. They prompted his intervention in Malta's constitutional controversy in the 1930s and combined with his intense conservatism to make him an ardent supporter of General Franco in the Spanish Civil War.<br>
<br>As a young man Zulueta had taken a prominent part in sport. Those who knew him later remember his handsome face and figure, the natural courtesy of his manners, perfect in his relations with all sorts of people and especially with children, and his great usefulness, with a knowledge of many languages, in dealing with foreign scholars. He was a loyal colleague whose sound legal instinct was displayed not only in his own special field and whose shrewdness and sagacity in discussions of policy and of ways and means were highly prized by his colleagues on the board of the faculty. His helpfulness to scholars of all ages even extended to the humble but exacting tasks of the editor and translator. He received many honours, including fellowship of the British Academy, an honorary fellowship of Merton, an honorary doctorate of Paris and of Aberdeen, and fellowship of the Accademia dei Lincei. Zulueta died at his home, 85 Cadogan Gardens, London, on 16 January 1958. A list of his publications is prefixed to <span class="italic">Studies in the Roman Law of Sale</span> (1959), dedicated to his memory and edited by David Daube.<br>
