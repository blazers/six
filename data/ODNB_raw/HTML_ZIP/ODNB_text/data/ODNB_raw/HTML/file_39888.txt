<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Berthoud, Sir  Eric Alfred</span>  (1900&#150;1989), <span class="occ">oil industrialist and diplomatist</span>, was born on 10 December 1900 in Kensington, London, the second son and third child in a family of four sons and two daughters of Alfred Edward Berthoud, of the private merchant bank Coulon, Berthoud &amp; Co., and his wife, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Christ, who came from a Swiss-Alsatian banking family. As a boy at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, Berthoud was greatly helped by his headmaster, G. W. S. Howson, who in 1914 found ways to keep him at the school when his father's bank collapsed and his relatives proposed moving him to Switzerland. In 1918 he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he played hockey for the university, did well at other sports, and took his degree in chemistry in 1922, paying his way with tutoring during vacation and further help from Howson. His father, an alcoholic, died in 1920.<br>
<br>After four years with the Anglo-Austrian Bank in Vienna and Milan (1922&#150;6), Berthoud joined the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later BP), serving in Paris (1926&#150;9). In 1927 he married Ruth Tilston (<i>d</i>. 1988), daughter of Sir Charles Bright, electrical engineer and fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and granddaughter of Sir Charles Tilston Bright, also an electrical engineer. They had a son who died in infancy, and two more sons and two daughters. Berthoud then moved with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Berlin (1929&#150;35) and back to Paris (1935&#150;8). On leaving Germany he sent a detailed memorandum to the director of military intelligence in London on Hitler's military build-up. When war began he joined the petroleum division of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, and by November 1939 he was installed at the British legation in Bucharest. His colleagues included the eccentric Edmund Hall-Patch, who was later helpful to his career. Berthoud's instructions were to impede the supply of Romanian oil to Germany by non-violent means such as diplomatic pressure, pre-emptive buying, manipulating prices, and cornering railcars, barges, and tankers on the Danube. These and other British activities in Romania worried the Germans for a time, but both German vulnerability and British ability to exploit it were exaggerated in London; Berthoud himself was in agreement with the policy, but realistic as to its effectiveness, compared with other factors outside British control. In January 1941, by which time Romania had effectively thrown in its lot with Germany, Britain broke off relations and the legation in Bucharest was closed. Berthoud spent the next four years in a variety of countries undertaking various tasks, all related to the objective of securing oil for the allies and denying it to the axis powers. One sensitive mission was to the USSR, to which he travelled three times by adventurous routes in 1941&#150;2. He soon became convinced of the need to support the USSR by all possible means&#151;this at a time when many in London were disinclined to spend scarce resources on what they saw as a hopeless cause.<br>
<br>In 1945 Berthoud was in charge of the economic division of the British element of the Allied Control Commission for Austria. He then worked on east European peace treaties, on problems affecting the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and finally on the Marshall plan, where his superiors valued his hard work and negotiating skill. After a long spell as assistant under-secretary in the Foreign Office (1948&#150;52), he could have moved up to the deputy under-secretary's seat, but preferred to go as ambassador to Denmark (1952&#150;6), where he made many friends. As ambassador in Warsaw (1956&#150;60) he sympathized with the strivings of the ordinary Polish people, while unconditionally condemning the regime. He was appointed CMG in 1945 and KCMG in 1954, and retired in May 1960. From 1969 he was deputy lieutenant of Essex. In retirement BP made him a non-executive director on certain of its regional boards. Among other things he was deeply involved in the United World colleges, the new University of Essex, and the Anglo-Polish round-table conferences.<br>
<br>With his athletic build, countryman's face, and ready smile, Berthoud was a more complex character than he looked. Only one-quarter British by blood, he was as proud of his continental connections as of his own compensating &#145;Britishness&#146;. As an ambassador he exacted a degree of deference (and punctuality) which some found excessive. He could be thick-skinned and overbearing, but there was a vein of sensitivity in him too, nourished by a protestant faith which strengthened as he grew older. He and his family lived in a series of houses in Essex and finally in Suffolk, where he enjoyed cricket and country sports to the full. Berthoud died in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 29 April 1989, his wife having predeceased him by a year.<br>
