<span class="headword">Prendergast <span class="st"> [Pendergrass]</span>, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;1709), <span class="occ">army officer and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was the third son of Thomas Prendergast (1614?&#150;1725) and his wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. in or before 1705), daughter of David Condon. He was possibly born at Croane, co. Tipperary, and had three brothers and at least three sisters. The Prendergasts, a prosperous Catholic family, had been based at Newcastle, co. Tipperary, but lost their property in the Cromwellian confiscations. Prendergast's father's elder brother Jeffery was transplanted to Connaught, and later emigrated to France with his Jacobite officer sons after the treaty of Limerick. Prendergast's father himself may have been the Thomas Prendergast who in 1665 occupied a one-hearth dwelling near the ruined family seat at Newcastle; the situation would have many Irish parallels. Jonathan Swift (who retrospectively hated Prendergast as a supposed false witness even before his anticlerical son offended him) described the elder Thomas Prendergast as a cottager narrowly saved from the gallows at Clonmel assizes for stealing cows by his protestant landlord Moore, and accused Prendergast himself of having worked as a shoeblack and footman.<br>
<br>During the Irish war of 1689&#150;91 Prendergast became a captain in the Jacobite cavalry. Many officers saw the war as furnishing a career, not a cause; military honour rather than Jacobitism or Catholicism provided their basic morality. A Captain Thomas Pendergrass was among 100 Jacobite officers who entered William's service after the final surrender of Limerick. By June 1693 it was intended to send them to fight for the Venetians in Greece, which would have practically amounted to perpetual banishment. At some point during the war, Prendergast was in France. A prisoner frantically seeking pardon in 1696 claimed that a &#145;Pendergrass&#146; was involved in the plots to kidnap William in late 1693, but attributed to him another man's actions. In England Prendergast joined the Jacobite debauchee George Porter as a highwayman. They operated from a Jacobite safe house in Hampshire run by William O'Brian (whose wife became their mistress about 1695). Prendergast felt himself under the greatest obligation to Porter.<br>
<br>In February 1696 Prendergast was called to London from Hampshire by Porter, who brought him into the assassination plot devised by Sir George Barclay. Prendergast was chosen for the party of eight men under Barclay who would attack William III's coach, and received a musketoon with which to fire repeatedly into it.<br>
<br>Late on 14 February 1696, the eve of the attempt, Prendergast secretly went to Whitehall, where he broke the news of the plot to William's confidential adviser Hans Willem Bentinck, earl of Portland. He told him that William must be prevented from hunting next day, but that the same honour and conscience which made him, a Catholic Jacobite, give the warning prevented him from testifying against, or even naming, his fellow conspirators, particularly one of them (Porter). Portland had earlier disregarded a similar general warning, but believed Prendergast and, with difficulty, persuaded William to cancel his hunting. After learning from their spies at Kensington that no alarm had been raised, the plotters prepared to try again a week later. A double agent, Francis Delarue, confirmed Prendergast's story, and when Prendergast went to Kensington Palace late on 21 February to give another warning, he was brought to the king. William told him that unless he revealed more details of the plot, he himself would not be safe should the assassins change their method and timing. With a promise that he should not be a witness unless he chose, Prendergast was persuaded to name the conspirators.<br>
<br>The next day, Prendergast was among them as they prepared to depart to ambush William at Turnham Green. When their Kensington agent brought them word that William's hunting was again cancelled, amid rumours of a plot, they agreed to disperse. Prendergast warned Portland of this, and retreated to Surrey with Porter and Porter's servant Thomas Keyes. As a cover, &pound;1000 was offered for his capture in the government's proclamation. The three men were captured (without collusion) on 27 February at Leatherhead. Porter immediately offered to turn king's evidence, and on 28 February implicated his comrades, including Prendergast. The latter, now that his friend was safe (though both remained some weeks in Newgate), agreed to be a witness. However, a latecomer to the plot, he testified only at the first trial, that of Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Keyes on 11 March, and at that of the conspirators' quartermaster Charles Cranburne. He received a pardon on 28 April 1696. After William O'Brian carried off to France Cardell Goodman, a witness against Sir John Fenwick, Prendergast persuaded Mrs O'Brian in early 1697 to follow as a spy.<br>
<br>William, with immense experience of informers, apparently believed that Prendergast's motives and scruples had been genuine, and distinguished him from the other witnesses. On 5 May 1696 he granted him &pound;3000 and ordered the Irish government to find for him a forfeited Jacobite estate worth &pound;500 a year. On 23 April 1697 Prendergast was finally granted one at Gort, co. Galway, where he supplanted not only the forfeited Jacobite owner, Roger O'Shaughnessy, but the Williamite Colonel Gustavus Hamilton (later Viscount Boyne), temporarily given it for services in the Irish war. As post-war depression had reduced the yearly value of the Gort estate by almost &pound;200, Prendergast, after petitioning, was additionally granted on 18 July 1698 other forfeited properties in several counties, theoretically worth &pound;334 a year.<br>
<br>Prendergast married at Dublin, by licence of 10 August 1697, Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1746), only daughter of the Dublin lawyer Henry Cadogan, of Liscarton, co. Meath, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4310/', "William Cadogan, later Earl Cadogan")</script>. He at some time converted to protestantism, and others of his close-knit family, whose fortunes he was restoring, apparently followed. He lived largely in Dublin.<br>
<br>On 23 September 1697, the Irish House of Commons passed a resolution of thanks to Prendergast. On 15 July 1699 he was created a baronet. The <span class="roman">Act of Resumption</span> of 1700 exempted his estates. In the Irish parliament of 1703 he became MP for Monaghan. He repurchased family properties, and began buying forfeited estates in various counties from the Hollow Sword Blade Company with loans it granted.<br>
<br>By 1706 Prendergast was lieutenant-colonel of the earl of Orrery's new infantry regiment, where he was joined by relatives. He could be a harsh disciplinarian. On 24 February 1707 he became colonel of his regiment. It was ordered to Flanders in April 1708, and was subsequently quartered at Oudenarde. On 1 January 1709 Prendergast was promoted brigadier-general. He fought bravely in the battle of Malplaquet on 11 September 1709 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, and was mortally wounded while leading his regiment against the French troops entrenched in the wood of Blaregnies; he was presumably buried near Malplaquet. A tradition, whose details vary, claimed that he had a strong premonition of his death, linked to the plot of 1696. Four of his six children reached adulthood, <a href="#cosubject_76574">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a> and three daughters who were later all married: Juliana (<i>d</i>. 1758) to Chaworth Brabazon, sixth earl of Meath (a love match); Elizabeth first to Sir John Dickson Hamon, bt (<i>d</i>. 1728) and second to Charles Smyth, MP for Limerick, with whom she had four children; and Anne to Samuel Hobson, of Muckridge. Among the provisions of his will was a &pound;14 annuity to his elderly father.<br>
<br>Swift in 1720 described Penelope, Lady Prendergast, as &#145;the greatest Widow Blacacre [obsessive litigant] now in Christendom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.341). She had little choice if she was to protect her son, as Earl Cadogan plundered his nephew's estate. It owed large sums to the Hollow Sword Blade Company. Roger O'Shaughnessy's rights in the Gort estate had been limited, and the family made repeated, though ultimately unsuccessful, legal attempts to reclaim it. Lady Prendergast died in Dublin between June and October 1746. Her will indicates fear that her son would embezzle her main bequest, to her faithful serving-maid, unless he thought it inconsiderable.<br>
<br>Prendergast's son, <a name="cosubject_76574"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Prendergast</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1702, <em>d.</em> 1760), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized at St Peter's and St Kevin's Church, Dublin, on 20 May 1702 and became a child ensign in his father's regiment. He was admitted a fellow-commoner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 21 May 1719, and entered the Inner Temple in 1721. He lobbied Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond, who had married his cousin Lady Sarah Cadogan, for a seat in the British parliament, and was returned to the Commons in March 1733 as MP for Chichester. In his first week, he voted against the government over the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> because Sir Robert Walpole would not make him Irish postmaster-general. Walpole covertly ensured his defeat in the 1734 general election. George II called him &#145;an Irish blockhead&#146;  (Sedgwick). Meanwhile, Prendergast was defeated in October 1733 in a by-election for the Irish Commons at Clonmel by Guy Moore, grandson of his grandfather's benefactor. The Commons reversed this on petition, and he sat for Clonmel until his death; this was one of several such setbacks to the Moore family's government-backed campaign to make it their pocket borough. Swift, however, blamed the &#145;parson-hunters&#146;, Prendergast's fellow anti-clericals. His Commons antics in 1736 provoked Swift in the poems &#145;Noisy Tom&#146; and &#145;The Legion Club&#146; to assail vituperatively both father and son:<blockquote>
<div>the spawn of him who shamed our isle,<br>
</div>
<div>the traitor, assassin, informer vile.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 550)</blockquote>On 11 January 1739, Prendergast married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1770), daughter and heir of Sir Griffith Williams, sixth baronet, of Marle, Caernarvonshire (where he stood unsuccessfully in the 1747 election). In 1754 he at last became Irish postmaster-general. He was lieutenant-governor of co. Galway. He died childless at his home in Merrion Street, Dublin, on 23 September 1760, while his patent as Viscount Clonmell was being prepared. His nephew and heir, John Prendergast Smyth (1741&#150;1817), the son of his sister Elizabeth, was created first Viscount Gort in 1816.<br>
