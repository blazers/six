<span class="headword">Nassau van Zuylestein,  William Frederick <span class="st"> [Willem Frederik]</span>  van</span>, first earl of Rochford  (1649&#150;1708), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, was born at Zuylestein near Utrecht and baptized on 7 October 1649 at The Hague, the elder son of Frederik van Nassau van Zuylestein and his wife, Mary Killigrew (<i>b</i>. 1627), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15541/', "Sir William Killigrew (bap. 1606, d. 1695)")</script> and maid of honour to Mary Stuart, princess royal of England and princess of Orange.<br>
<br>William Frederick's father, <a name="cosubject_30309"></a><span class="headword">Frederik  van Nassau van Zuylestein</span>  (1624&#150;1672), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was the illegitimate son of Prince William III of Orange's grandfather, Frederik Hendrik van Nassau, prince of Orange, and (it is thought) Margareta Katharina Bruyns, daughter of a burgomaster of Emmerik. Frederik Hendrik had him educated at court, giving him the title jonker van Buren and in May 1640 presenting him with the lordship of Zuylestein and Leersum. Entering the army of the states general he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of an infantry regiment in 1645, colonel three years later, and took part in Prince William II's abortive siege of Amsterdam in 1650. His marriage to Mary Killigrew on 18 October 1648 had meanwhile brought him into the English entourage of Mary Stuart, princess of Orange, who in 1659 appointed him as a suitably Anglophile governor to her eight-year-old son, the future William III. For the next seven years, first at Leiden and then at The Hague, he supervised every aspect of the prince's upbringing, from religious observance and language tuition to diet and outdoor exercise. A close bond of affection developed between them, and William was devastated when in April 1666 Zuylestein was replaced in his post by a nominee of the grand pensionary John de Witt, following the decision of the states of Holland to adopt the prince as a ward of state.<br>
<br>Zuylestein continued, however, to receive an official salary and he remained close to Orange. He accompanied him on his first visit to England in November 1670; and, according to Bishop Gilbert Burnet, he was the one person in whom the prince confided following a remarkable private conversation with his uncle Charles II, in which the king revealed his &#145;papist&#146; beliefs  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.501&#150;2). About this time Zuylestein also resumed his career in the army. Promoted lieutenant-general in January 1668 he was made military governor of Breda in April 1670 and general of foot in February 1672. From Breda in May the same year he reported the movements of invading French forces along the Maas, and during the period of panic and disorder that followed the invasion he returned to The Hague where he witnessed the murder of the de Witt brothers by the mob on 20 August. (Whether he was personally involved in planning the murder, or in encouraging those who committed it, cannot be established with certainty, though as a prominent Orangist he was inevitably suspected of complicity.) He fought two months later in Orange's attempt to recapture Woerden on the border between Holland and Utrecht and he was killed at Grevenbrugge on 12 October 1672 by French forces under the duc de Luxembourg coming to relieve the town. Buried in the Kloosterkerk at The Hague on 17 January 1673, his remains were subsequently removed to Leersum.<br>
<br>With Zuylestein's death the lordship passed to his elder son, William Frederick, who was already serving in a cavalry regiment of the Dutch army. Good-looking and assured, he was close in age to the prince of Orange and had become one of his favourite companions, sharing his enthusiasm for hunting. The prince was less approving when Zuylestein seduced and was forced to marry Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1659, <i>d</i>. 1703), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30081/', "Sir Henry Wroth (1604/5&#150;1671)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30083/', "Wroth, Sir Robert")</script>] and Anne Maynard, a maid of honour to the princess of Orange. The marriage ceremony was performed secretly on 28 January 1681 in the princess's chapel at The Hague and shortly afterwards a son was born, the first of six children. But Zuylestein was quickly restored to favour and in August 1687 was sent as a special envoy to London, ostensibly to offer Orange's condolences on the death of Queen Mary of Modena's mother. The real purpose of the mission was to gauge James II's intentions towards parliament and to canvass opinion among his opponents; its result was the establishment of an extensive correspondence network providing William with intelligence of English affairs. By the following spring the prince had made his decision to mount an invasion of England, provided he could be sure of support there; and it was to obtain that assurance that Zuylestein was sent on a second English mission late in June 1688. The pretext now was to convey William's congratulations to the king and queen on the birth of their son&#151;a birth which Zuylestein found was widely considered a fraud. And he had further meetings with the king's leading opponents, approving the so-called &#145;invitation&#146; in which they pledged their support for Orange and agreeing their responsibilities in the final preparations for the invasion. By early August he was back in The Hague, reporting to William on the Association of Protestant Officers in James's army. He appears to have made a brief final reconnaissance visit to England early in November. As William's armada set sail from the Maas estuary on 2/12 November he joined the prince on board the <i>Brill</i>, reporting on the strength and movements of James II's army and recommending that the fleet should land in Dorset or Devon.<br>
<br>Zuylestein was now a major-general in the Dutch army and his cavalry regiment was one of the fifteen which disembarked with the rest of Orange's forces at Torbay on 5/15 November to begin their six weeks' advance on London. A month later he was with the prince at Windsor when a letter was received from James II (detained at Rochester after his first attempt to flee the country) proposing a meeting with Orange in London. Zuylestein was immediately dispatched with a reply whose effect was both to evade the meeting (as William intended) and to force James out of the capital for good. Delivering his message to the king at St James's Palace on 16 December he insisted that Orange would not enter London while it contained forces under James's command. The following day those forces were withdrawn as Dutch guards occupied Whitehall, and on 18 December James himself was escorted back to Rochester. From there, four days later, he left for France.<br>
<br>Zuylestein was duly rewarded for his part in preparing and carrying through the revolution. He was naturalized on 11 May 1689&#151;a month after William and Mary's coronation&#151;and on 23 May was appointed master of the robes. Yet for all the skill and shrewdness of judgement that he had displayed in his missions of 1687 and 1688 he was reluctant to involve himself further in English political life&#151;less perhaps out of laziness, as some alleged, than from fear of parliamentary attack. As he explained to William's private secretary, Constantijn Huygens, &#145;he had no pretensions to be part of the grand deliberations&#146; since &#145;in England it was customary for favourites and counsellors to be accused and punished if the king had done wrong&#146;  (Huygens, <span class="italic">Journaal</span>, 1.70). Instead, his services to William III during the 1690s were principally military. He accompanied him to Ireland in June 1690, fighting at the Boyne on 1 July and returning to London in August to bring news of the campaign to the queen; and in September he was promoted lieutenant-general in the English army. Subsequent years took him to the war against France in the Low Countries, where he fought with distinction at the battle of Landen (29 July 1693), rescuing the king from danger; he was wounded and taken prisoner to Namur, though he was later exchanged.<br>
<br>Further honours were given to Zuylestein. On 10 May 1695 he was created Baron Enfield, Viscount Tunbridge, and earl of Rochford, while his office as master of the robes passed to William's favourite, Arnold Joost van Keppel. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 29 February 1696. From 25 December 1695 he received an annual pension from the crown of &pound;1000; and on 26 April 1696 William granted him the confiscated estates of the marquess of Powis in Montgomeryshire, followed in July 1698 by more than 30,000 acres of forfeited Irish lands. It is unlikely, however, that he ever lived at Powis Castle; and his Irish property had to be handed over to public trustees following an <span class="roman">Act of Resumption</span> passed by parliament in April 1700. About this time he acquired an English country house at Easton, Suffolk, but he returned frequently to his family estates at Zuylestein, where he developed the gardens first laid out by Frederik Hendrik and experimented with afforestation. Following the death of William III in March 1702 he remained briefly in Suffolk before going back to the Netherlands, where his last years were spent. He died at Zuylestein on 12 July 1708, and was succeeded as second earl of Rochford by his eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30313/', "William van Nassau van Zuylestein")</script>.<br>
