<span class="headword">Bligh,  Edward Vesey</span>  (1829&#150;1908), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 28 February 1829 at 37 Grosvenor Place, London. He was the second son of Edward Bligh, fifth earl of Darnley (1795&#150;1835), and his wife, Emma (1804&#150;1884), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21386/', "Henry Parnell, first Baron Congleton")</script>. His mother was a strict Irvingite trembling on the edge of religious mania. Although Bligh's uncle and guardian, Longley, later archbishop of Canterbury, ensured that he was reared in the Church of England, a strain of ultra-protestantism was nevertheless grafted onto the boy. Bligh was educated at Eton College (1839&#150;45), in Hanover and France (1845&#150;6), and at Christ Church, Oxford (1848&#150;50), where he chiefly hunted and raced. Leaving Oxford without taking a degree, he worked in the Foreign Office under Palmerston, and served as an attach&eacute; at Hanover (1850&#150;51), Florence (1851&#150;2), and Berlin (1852&#150;3). His most important work in Florence was on behalf of Englishmen who had been insulted or arrested by the Austrian military authorities protecting the r&eacute;gime of Grand Duke Leopold; his intervention saved from execution the three Stratford brothers, sons of the fifth earl of Aldborough.<br>
<br>At this time Bligh fell in love with Lady Isabel Mary Frances Nevill (1831&#150;1915), whose family at Eridge Castle were county neighbours of the Darnleys at Cobham Hall. As a precondition of their marriage her father, the fourth earl of Abergavenny, insisted that Bligh abandon diplomacy and settle in Kent. Yielding to this ultimatum, and committing vocational suicide, Bligh was married on 23 February 1854. The couple had two children, a son and a daughter. As a married undergraduate Bligh attended Downing College, Cambridge (MA 1854), before ordination (1855). He was a lieutenant in the West Kent yeomanry (1853&#150;5), chaplain to that corps (1855&#150;70), and curate at Snodland (1855&#150;6); in 1856 was appointed to a living within Abergavenny's gift near Eridge at Rotherfield. Bligh, whose detestation of Roman Catholicism had increased in Tuscany, found that his congregation had been alienated by the sacerdotalism of the previous rector. As an evangelical who preached in the open air he won back some parishioners, but was so disheartened by the difficulties of his poor, sprawling parish that in 1863 he broke down. While recuperating he was impressed by the lay evangelical Sir Arthur Blackwood and henceforth allied himself with low-church reformers such as lords Radstock and Ebury. He was active in the Prayer Book Revision Society and from 1864 had numerous letters published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. He controversially preached to the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion in order to promote Anglican intercommunion with Reformation, rather than with what he regarded as ritualistic priest-ridden, churches.<br>
<br>In 1865 Bligh became vicar of Birling, a moribund parish in Abergavenny's gift, and initiated the Birling religious revival of 1866. Supported by lay evangelists he achieved some conversions and deathbed confessions but raised social unrest against the Abergavennys, who suppressed his zeal. He was relieved when his wife's inheritance enabled him to buy Fartherwell Hall, near West Malling, in 1874, and to resign his incumbency the following year. Although active as a Kentish magistrate, deputy lieutenant, and county alderman, Bligh was long oppressed by a sense of failure. After visiting Palestine in 1890 and publishing <span class="italic">Lord Ebury as a Church Reformer</span> (1891) he emerged from his depression to enjoy an affectionate and contented old age. Like most Blighs he was a talented cricketer (his grandson in 1887 was christened Harroweton after the match) and a superb game shot. He died of chronic gout and heart failure on 22 April 1908 at Fartherwell Hall, and was buried at Birling churchyard.<br>
