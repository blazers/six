<span class="headword">Marnock,  Robert</span>  (1800&#150;1889), <span class="occ">landscape gardener</span>, was born on 12 March 1800, at Kintore, Aberdeenshire, the son of Peter Marnock, a farmer. He is first recorded as a gardener at Bretton Hall, Yorkshire, and while there he won the competition to design the Sheffield Botanic Garden, which he laid out in 1834; he was also appointed its first curator. While at Sheffield he was involved in the publication of a number of gardening magazines: from 1836 to 1842 he edited the monthly <span class="italic">Floricultural Magazine</span>, and for several years, beginning in 1845, he edited the weekly <span class="italic">United Gardeners' and Land Stewards' Journal</span>. With Richard Deakin, he wrote the first volume of <span class="italic">Florigraphia Britannica, or, Engravings and Descriptions of the Flowering Plants and Ferns of Britain</span> (1837). On 17 October 1838, at the Independent Chapel, Welford, Northampton, he married Anne (1810/11&#150;1885), daughter of Benjamin Hobson, dissenting minister. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In 1840 Marnock won a second competition to design the garden of the Royal Botanic Society in Regent's Park. The design kept &#145;the number of walks to a minimum&#146;, left &#145;the central mass of the garden an open lawn&#146; and screened &#145;the specialist gardens behind shrubberies and an elevated rockwork; the garden was bisected by a straight walk leading to the great conservatory, thus imposing an axis of symmetry&#146;  (Elliott, 40). It led to the recognition of Marnock as one of the leading landscape gardeners of the day. During much of his time at Regent's Park he was aided by the Irishman William Robinson, most of whose early work after his arrival in England was carried out under Marnock's aegis. As curator of the garden, Marnock also successfully managed the exhibitions at the Royal Botanic Society's gardens. He relinquished his post there in 1862, after which date he practised as a landscape gardener.<br>
<br>Marnock's style was that usually described as &#145;natural&#146; or &#145;picturesque&#146;, while his work was sound and severely economical. The maxims of his approach are expressed in extracts from letters compiled by Mungo Temple in 1870. Among the practices Marnock objected to were &#145;The dotting of trees and shrubs on lawns like sentinels &hellip; or placing anything on a lawn at all which in any way interrupted the view or defaced the space&#146;, &#145;formal avenues, where they could easily be dispensed with&#146;, and &#145;roads to the dwelling house, taking long out-of-the-way turns, where they could be concealed and the distance shortened&#146;  (Elliott, 168). As a general principle, he sought the easy, unimpeded movement of the eye over the scene ahead. His chief designs are those at Greenlands, Henley-on-Thames, made for the Rt Hon. W. H. Smith; at Hampstead, for Sir Spencer Wells; at Possingworth, Sussex, for Lewis Huth; at Blythwood, near Taplow, for George Hanbury; at Brambletye, near East Grinstead, for Donald Larnach; at Leigh Place, near Tonbridge, for Samuel Morley, and at Weston Park, Sheffield; Park Place, Henley; Taplow Court; Eynsham Hall; Sopley Park; and Montague House, Whitehall. His work for Prince Demidov at San Donato, near Florence, in 1852, added greatly to his reputation, and to the increasing taste for English gardening on the continent. His last public work was the Alexandra Park at Hastings, laid out in 1878. He retired in 1879, leaving his business to Joseph Weston, although he continued to give professional advice on landscape gardening until the spring of 1889, in which year he designed his last private garden, that of Sir Henry Peck at Rousdon, near Lyme Regis.<br>
<br>Marnock spent the last summers of his long life in Aberdeenshire with his two daughters, rambling over the high mountains in search of wild flowers. He died at his home, 1B Oxford and Cambridge Mansions, Marylebone Road, London, on 15 November 1889. In accordance with his wishes his body, after a religious service, was cremated at Woking, and his ashes were deposited in his wife's grave at Kensal Green cemetery on 20 November.<br>
