<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tickell,  Thomas</span>  (1685&#150;1740), <span class="occ">poet and government official</span>, was the son of the Revd Richard Tickell (<i>c</i>.1648&#150;1692), rector of Distington, Cumberland, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gale (<i>d</i>. 1729). Thomas, who was sixth child and fourth son in a family of eight, was born on 17 December 1685 and baptized on 19 January 1686 at Bridekirk, his father's former parish. After his father died on 22 June 1692 at Distington the family moved to Whitehaven and Thomas was sent in 1695 to school at St Bees, under his uncle the Revd Richard Jackson. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, aged fifteen, on 16 May 1701, entering the college as a &#145;taberer&#146; or scholar on the foundation; he graduated BA on 7 July 1705 and MA on 22 February 1709, and was elected fellow on 9 November 1710. As he did not comply with the college statute by taking orders, he belatedly obtained a dispensation from the crown (25 October 1717) and held his fellowship until he married in 1726.<br>
<br>Tickell's first publication was <span class="italic">Oxford</span> (November 1706), a long topographical poem inscribed to his friend and fellow collegian, Richard, Viscount Lonsdale (<i>d</i>. 1713). Next he contributed eight short amatory or complimentary poems to Tonson's <span class="italic">Poetical Miscellanies</span> (1709), including an elegant address to Joseph Addison on his opera <span class="italic">Rosamond</span>. In 1711 he lectured in place of Joseph Trapp, professor of poetry: his one surviving lecture, &#145;De poesi didactica&#146;, expresses the hope that poets of Britain will gird themselves up for the grandeur of writing didactic poetry. Meanwhile his own poetry and scholarship were disparaged by the peevish Thomas Hearne, who called him &#145;a vain, conceited Coxcomb&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 3.218) and claimed that he was the true author of an untraced short-lived weekly Oxford paper called <span class="italic">The Surprise</span> (1711). Tickell's next traced work, a long poem, <span class="italic">The Prospect of Peace</span>, dedicated to the bishop of Bristol, a plenipotentiary in negotiations for the treaty of Utrecht, was published in October 1712; it rapidly ran into six editions, and was praised by Addison in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (no. 523).<br>
<br>Tickell repaid the compliment with interest in verses &#145;To the supposed author of the <i>Spectator</i>&#146; (calling Addison the &#145;British Virgil&#146;) in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, no. 532, and in &#145;Verses to the Author&#146; in the seventh edition of <span class="italic">Cato</span> and a prologue for a performance of <span class="italic">Cato</span> at Oxford (both 1713). In April 1713 he wrote five anonymous papers on pastoral poetry for Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. Tickell favoured a pastoral naturalized to English rustic life; he praised Ambrose Philips as the English descendant of Theocritus, but did not mention Pope, who, like Philips, had recently published pastorals. Pope resentfully responded with his ironic <span class="italic">Guardian</span> no. 40, which occasioned his quarrel with Philips. Tickell's uncontroversial <span class="italic">Guardian</span> no. 125 (August 1713) included a fragment of a georgic, &#145;Hunting&#146;. By 1714 he had joined the group of Addison's disciples who met regularly at Button's Coffee House in Russell Street.<br>
<br>Tickell welcomed the arrival of George I in verse with &#145;The Royal Progress&#146; (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, no. 620), and four more poems by him appeared in Steele's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (1714), including a specimen of his projected translation of Lucan's <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span>, begun in 1713. A subscription list for an edition of Lucan was opened but the work was never completed, perhaps because it was overtaken by Rowe's translation (1718). Tickell also never completed a translation of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, for which he was contracted by Jacob Tonson on 31 May 1714, two months after Bernard Lintot agreed with Pope for a translation of the same work. It seems that Tonson wanted to spoil Lintot's market by employing a better classical scholar than Pope; it is certain that Addison and fellow whigs backed Tickell, and Pope convinced himself that Addison, not Tickell, was the actual translator. The rival translations of book 1 were published in the same week of June 1715, when Tickell announced that he would not proceed with the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> because it had fallen into an abler hand, but he hoped the public would encourage him to translate the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>. Each translator privately made hostile notes on the other's work, but they did not enter into direct public controversy beyond a few remarks in Pope's <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span> (1728, chap. 12). Pope adopted some of Tickell's lines in preference to his own in the second edition of his <span class="italic">Iliad</span>; he was eventually reconciled to Tickell (Addison's cat's-paw as Pope believed), but was unable to forgive Addison himself for what he thought was underhand dealing. Hence his satirical character sketch, later called &#145;Atticus&#146; (first published 1722), to which Tickell wrote a neat riposte which fell into the hands of Edmund Curll, who printed it without authorization in <span class="italic">Cythereia</span> (1723), attributing it to Jeremiah Markland.<br>
<br>The change of dynasty brought Addison back into government: first, in September 1714, as secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, then, from April 1717, secretary of state for the southern department (responsible for relations with France, southern Europe, Ireland, and the plantations, as well as a huge variety of domestic affairs). In both offices he employed Tickell as under-secretary, against the advice of Sir Richard Steele, who observed that Tickell &#145;was of a temper too enterprising to be governed&#146;, which &#145;produced a great animosity between Sir Richard and Mr. Tickell, which subsisted during their lives&#146;  (Cibber, 5.18). Addison, his health failing, resigned the secretaryship in March 1718. Tickell's reputation and record were such that he was retained as under-secretary by Addison's successor, James Craggs, and by Craggs's successor, Lord John Carteret, who became secretary in March 1721. One of Tickell's many duties was the collection of news for the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, but his own literary work at this time was scanty: no more than a few complimentary poems, a long topographical poem, <span class="italic">Kensington Garden</span> (1722), and a clever anti-Jacobite epistle, <span class="italic">From a Lady in England to a Gentleman at Avignon</span> (1717), which, according to Johnson, &#145;stands high among party poems; it expresses contempt without coarseness and superiority without insolence&#146;  (Johnson, 2.310).<br>
<br>Addison died on 17 June 1719, bequeathing the task of editing his works to Tickell rather than his quondam closest literary associate, Steele. The edition in four quarto volumes was published in October 1721; it was thought to have earned &pound;1350 for Tickell and certainly provoked a dispute with Tonson over copyright. Steele, too, was dissatisfied. Thinking himself belittled in Tickell's preface, he published in 1722 a new edition of Addison's <span class="italic">The Drummer</span> (omitted from Tickell's edition) with a prefatory epistle which repeated the charge that Addison wrote the Homer translation published over Tickell's name, and complained of Tickell's &#145;cold, unaffectionate, dry, and barren&#146; account of Addison. Whatever the tone of Tickell's preface, his noble elegy on Addison is anything but cold, unaffectionate, dry, and barren: Johnson, Goldsmith, and others thought it one of the finest in the language. Pope's lines to Addison, &#145;On Medals&#146;, also printed in this edition, signalled that poet's reconciliation with Tickell and Addison's shade.<br>
<br>When Carteret was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in April 1724 he retained Tickell in his service as chief secretary to the lords justices, who deputized in the absence of the lord lieutenant. Tickell moved to Dublin and devoted himself to official business, not literature, though he cultivated a friendship with Swift. In the sixteen remaining years of his life he published only three short poems: his popular ballad <span class="italic">Lucy and Colin</span> (1725), much admired by Thomas Gray and Oliver Goldsmith, &#145;The Horn-Book&#146;, &#145;written under a fit of the gout&#146; (Lewis's <span class="italic">Miscellany</span>, 1726), and, in 1733, lines celebrating the classical rebuilding of medieval Queen's College, Oxford (to which Tickell had contributed &pound;50).<br>
<br>On 23 April 1726, in Dublin, Tickell married Clotilda Eustace (1700/01&#150;1792), heir to a fortune of &pound;10,000; Clotilda and her mother were old friends of Swift. By marriage Tickell became a considerable landowner in co. Kildare, but his principal residence was at Glasnevin, Dublin (later the home of the National Botanic Gardens). Tickell retained his post under Carteret's two successors as lord lieutenant, the duke of Dorset (1730&#150;37) and the duke of Devonshire. Between 1729 and 1738 he and Clotilda had three daughters and two sons, one of whom was the father of the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27431/', "Richard Tickell (1751&#150;1793)")</script>. Thomas Tickell did not live long to enjoy his family: he died at Bath on 21 April 1740, aged fifty-four, and was buried at Glasnevin. The inscription on his monument in the church there enumerates his public offices, but adds &#145;his highest honour was that of having been the friend of Addison&#146;. Clotilda died in 1792, in her ninety-second year, after which her late husband's library was sold.<br>
<br>Tickell's poems had a place of honour at the beginning of the first volume of Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection</span> (1748) and, with the occasional addition of verse unpublished in his lifetime, were included in most standard collections of English poetry down to the early nineteenth century. Some were not printed until 1931 (in the biography by R. E. Tickell). Johnson assigned Tickell &#145;a high place among minor poets&#146;, adding &#145;he is said to have been a man of gay conversation, at least a temperate lover of wine and company, and in his domestick relations without censure&#146;  (Johnson, 2.311). Tickell's nephew, the Revd Daniel Watson (1718&#150;1804), said his uncle &#145;had a placid look, and yet was as waspish a cur as you would wish to meet with&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 1.436).<br>
