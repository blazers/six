<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Charles Cooper Penrose</span>  (1841&#150;1921), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Corkbeg, co. Cork, on 30 April 1841, the second son of Robert Uniacke Penrose-Fitzgerald DL JP (1800&#150;1857), of Corkbeg Island, co. Cork, who in 1834 assumed the name of Fitzgerald after that of Penrose, and his wife, Frances Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1892), eldest daughter of the Revd Robert Austin, prebendary of Cloyne Cathedral. Fitzgerald was educated at Dr Burney's academy, Gosport, and joined the Royal Navy in 1854, on HMS <i>Victory</i> in Portsmouth harbour. As a midshipman he served in the Baltic campaign of 1855, went to the Black Sea in 1856, and then joined HMS <i>Retribution</i> on the China station. On commissioning as a lieutenant in May 1860 he was appointed to HMS <i>Ariadne</i>, and quickly attracted attention. Throughout his career he was recognized as one of the finest seamen in the service. In July 1871 he was promoted commander, serving in several ships, including the battleships <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Agincourt</i>. He was badly injured in a hunting accident in Ireland in 1879 and was effectively laid up for a year. He was promoted captain on 19 March 1880, and in August he took command of HMS <i>Inconstant</i>, flagship of the flying squadron that sailed round the world. On his return, on 29 November 1882 he married Henrietta Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of the Revd Francis Hewson of Dunganstown, co. Wicklow; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Although an outstanding sailor, who published <span class="italic">Hints on Boat Sailing</span> (1883), Fitzgerald believed that masts and sails had no place on a modern warship, and said so at the Royal United Service Institution in 1887. After commanding HMS <i>Inconstant</i> on a &#145;round the world&#146; cruise he concluded that sails were wasteful and demoralizing to the men. His paper helped to ensure the final abolition of sailing rig in front-line warships. In 1884&#150;5 he was captain of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. The following year he commanded HMS <i>Bellerophon</i>, the flagship on the West Indies station. In 1888&#150;9 he took a prominent part alongside Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby and Captain Lord Charles Beresford in the public debate on naval policy that culminated in the <span class="roman">Naval Defence Act</span> of 1889. He remained a notable correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span> for the rest of his life. After his prominent activity ashore, Fitzgerald commanded HMS <i>Collingwood</i> in the Mediterranean Fleet between November 1889 and January 1893. During the last year the fleet was commanded by Admiral Sir George Tryon. Fitzgerald was immediately taken with Tryon's radical tactical ideas, which dispensed with excessive signalling and relied on sound doctrine and initiative among captains. After Tryon's death in June 1893 in the <i>Victoria</i> tragedy, Fitzgerald publicly defended Tryon's methods in the press debate and wrote a pamphlet explaining his tactical system and a biography, <span class="italic">The Life of Admiral Sir George Tryon</span> (1897), to remind the nation and the service of Tryon's immense contribution to naval modernization. It was also something of a lament for a lost leader, for Fitzgerald's career did not prosper when the reaction set in against Tryon's system and he was too closely identified with Tryon to be given further employment on the key stations.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald next wrote a biography of Admiral Rooke for John Laughton's Greenwich Naval College text <span class="italic">From Howard to Nelson: Twelve Sailors</span> (1899), and served on the council of the Navy Records Society. In recognition of his abilities he had been appointed a naval aide-de-camp in mid-1892, an honour he held while serving as captain superintendent of Pembroke dockyard, from January 1893 until March 1895. Both offices lapsed on his promotion to rear-admiral on 20 February 1895. In 1897&#150;9 he served as second in command of the China station, just missing the Boxer uprising, but was not otherwise employed after reaching flag rank. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 28 March 1901, although he had no employment, and was advanced to admiral on 20 February 1905. He was placed on the retired list at his own request on 2 March 1905. Fitzgerald continued to take an active interest in naval issues, publishing a stark warning that Germany was mounting a deliberate challenge to the Royal Navy as early as 1905. His other contribution to the naval debates of the period was a sustained critique of the reforms introduced by Lord Fisher, his contemporary in the service. He particularly opposed the Selborne scheme of common entry for all officers.<br>
<br>Fit and athletic, even in later life, Fitzgerald wrote two volumes of reminiscences, <span class="italic">Memories of the Sea</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">From Sail to Steam</span> (1916), expressing his enthusiasm for the service, and his opinions on such issues as the abolition of masts. In late August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, he organized a band of women in Folkestone to distribute white feathers to &#145;slackers&#146; and &#145;loafers&#146;, as he termed young men who had not joined the armed services, an initiative that received newspaper publicity and prompted the wider use of this humiliating gesture to encourage enlistment. He died at his home, 2 Trinity Road, Folkestone, Kent, on 11 August 1921. Although a fine seaman and nicknamed Rough, Fitzgerald was a reflective as well as a practical officer. His public advocacy and writings helped to reshape the late Victorian navy into a modern service.<br>
