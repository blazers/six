<span class="headword">Clarke,  Henry Butler</span>  (1863&#150;1904), <span class="occ">historian of Spain</span>, born on 9 November 1863 at Marchington, Staffordshire, of which parish his father was incumbent, was the elder son of Henry Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1884) and his wife, Helen, daughter of John Leech of Etwall, near Derby. In 1867 his father became rector of Rokeby. Henry was educated successively at a small school at Whorlton, near Rokeby, at a preparatory school at Richmond, Yorkshire, and finally (1879&#150;83), owing to delicate health, at St Jean de Luz in the French Pyrenees, near the Spanish border, where he read with the Basque scholar Wentworth Webster, and where his father was British chaplain in 1882&#150;4. Spanish history and literature thus came to attract him, and during early visits to Spain he met many social and political leaders, including C&aacute;novas de Castillo. In 1883 he went for a time to Germany with a pupil. Improved health enabled him to matriculate at Wadham College, Oxford, in October 1885, and although with little previous knowledge of Greek, he obtained a good second class in honour moderations in 1887. In 1888 he won the Taylorian scholarship for Spanish. An attack of neurasthenia, which recurred regularly throughout his life, obliged him to content himself with a pass degree the following year.<br>
<br>From 1890 to 1892 Clarke was Taylorian teacher of Spanish at Oxford and in 1894 he was elected to a Fereday fellowship (open to those born in Staffordshire) at St John's College, Oxford, where he usually lived for a term every year until his death. In 1891 he built for himself a house at St Jean de Luz, which he named Aice Errota, after a windmill which had once stood there. He spent much of his time there, studying Spanish literature and history. He did not marry.<br>
<br>Clarke published a <span class="italic">Spanish Grammar</span> (1892), a <span class="italic">History of Spanish Literature</span> (1893), and a study of <span class="italic">The Cid Campeador</span> (1897), for which he learned Arabic. He was a contributor to the first volume of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span> (1902). His major work, published posthumously, was <span class="italic">Modern Spain, 1815&#150;1898</span> (1906), adjudged by Sir Charles Firth to be &#145;remarkable at once for its rigour, its vivacity, and the sobriety of its judgement&#146;  (C. Firth, <span class="italic">Modern Languages at Oxford, 1724&#150;1929</span>, 1929, 68). It remains of value as containing &#145;much information not easily obtainable elsewhere&#146;  (R. Carr, <span class="italic">Modern Spain, 1808&#150;1975</span>, 1978, 780). Clarke was widely travelled, and made an annual continental tour which extended on one occasion as far as Syria and India. A keen fisherman, a knowledgeable ornithologist, and a fair shot, he was a collector of ancient brasswork, tiles, and manuscripts, became keenly interested in art, and painted in watercolours. He was considered strikingly handsome, possessing remarkable personal charm as both a humorous and profound conversationalist.<br>
<br>In 1904 Clarke set to work seriously on what he planned to be his most wide-ranging study, on the early history of Spanish civilization. He had collected a large number of rare and valuable works for the purpose, and travelled extensively through Spain to get to know the people about whom he would be writing. But he suffered a severe recurrence of nervous illness, and while recuperating at Torquay his mind gave way and he shot himself on 10 September 1904. He was buried in Torquay cemetery on 13 September. The greater part of his fine library was presented by his family to St John's College.<br>
