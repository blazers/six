<span class="headword">Dixon, Sir  Alfred Herbert</span>, baronet  (1857&#150;1920), <span class="occ">cotton spinner</span>, was born at 14 St George's Terrace, Kensington, London, on 22 February 1857, the sixth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7698/', "Henry Hall Dixon (1822&#150;1870)")</script>, barrister and racing journalist, and Caroline, daughter of Thomas Lynes of Hackleton House, Northamptonshire. Educated at Kensington grammar school and Brighton School, Dixon followed his grandfather, Peter Dixon of Carlisle, in entering the cotton industry. He served his apprenticeship with William Houldsworth at the Reddish Spinning Company, Stockport. In 1876 he joined A. &amp; G. Murray, a well-established but by then declining Manchester firm of fine cotton spinners, which, under his youthful but astute management, re-emerged in the forefront of the industry. On 7 April 1880 he married Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of Henry Sandford, cotton manufacturer of Cringle Hall, Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1898 Dixon rejoined Houldsworth in establishing the Fine Spinners' and Doublers' Association, a pioneering amalgamation of thirty-one firms in the cotton industry, which sought to achieve economies of scale in a form of corporate enterprise appropriate to the early twentieth century. The Fine Spinners, with Dixon as its managing director, developed a strong central organization, able to co-ordinate its component firms into a successful vertically integrated whole, avoiding the problems of continuing family autonomy, which bedevilled other early amalgamations. The Fine Spinners was to be the most successful of the early textile mergers in England, with an effective dominance, but never a monopoly, of the fine-spinning sector. By 1909 it had grown to comprise fifty firms, 4 million spindles, and over 30,000 employees, forming Edwardian Britain's largest firm. Under Dixon's guidance, it also set a lead in scientific research, employee welfare, and direct investment in cotton plantations in America and cotton merchanting in Egypt. Dixon remained managing director until 1917, when he became chairman until his death. He cautiously but decisively held back the Fine Spinners from overcapitalization at the end of the war, thus putting the firm in a relatively strong position during the 1920s, and earning his reputation as &#145;perhaps the wisest as well as the most courageous of cotton men&#146;  (B. Bowker, <span class="italic">Lancashire under the Hammer</span>, 1928, 40).<br>
<br>Dixon also played a pre-eminent part in the business politics of cotton. He was active within the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners, particularly in its labour and conciliation work, was a director of the Manchester Royal Exchange, president of the Textile Institute (1919), and a leading advocate of the empire cotton-growing movement. His strong belief in the collective organization of industry led to his participation in the Federation of British Industry in 1916, serving on several of its early committees and chairing its Manchester branch. Dixon was also one of the growing breed of internationally minded pre-war men of business, an ardent supporter of the International Cotton Federation before 1914 and, as its president in 1919, ready to promote it as a &#145;businessman's League of Nations&#146;. He led the British delegation to the World Cotton Congress in New Orleans in 1919, and but for his untimely death, he would have presided at the Manchester congress of 1921.<br>
<br>Dixon's standing with masters and men made him an excellent choice as chairman of the Cotton Control Board set up by the government in June 1917 in order to keep the industry working with a minimum supply of raw cotton. It successfully provided a form of collective regulation, a buffer between the government, the unions, and the employers. The board's schemes avoided redundancies in cotton, allaying the government's fears of the social and political unrest which a second cotton famine might have brought. The wisdom of retaining labour in cotton has been questioned, but there is no doubt that Dixon skilfully achieved the board's objectives, combining, in Hubert Henderson's words, &#145;in a high measure the devotion to duty, the resourceful vigour, the shrewdness, the tenacity of purpose, even obstinacy of a Lancashire businessman&#146; with &#145;the graces of a singularly gentle and winning personality&#146;  (Henderson, 10). Dixon's work was rewarded with a baronetcy on 7 February 1918. He was also a valued contributor to the post-war Board of Trade advisory committee.<br>
<br>Dixon was an enthusiastic actor and cricketer in his youth, but his later activities were hampered by ill health, though in 1915 he chaired the committee which raised the Manchester Pals volunteer battalions. He died at his home, The Moss, Great Warford, Cheshire, on 10 December 1920, of the bronchial asthma from which he had long suffered. He was buried on 13 December at Chelford parish church, where he had served as churchwarden. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
