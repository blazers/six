<span class="headword">Dix,  George Eglinton Alston</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Gregory Dix]</span>  (1901&#150;1952), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and liturgical scholar</span>, was born at Woolwich on 4 October 1901, the elder son of George Henry Dix (1872&#150;1932), a schoolmaster of partly French descent who afterwards took orders and became the first principal of the College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea, and his wife, Mary Jane Walker (1872/3&#150;1939). Little information survives about his early years, apart from his education at Temple Grove, Eastbourne (1908&#150;15) and Westminster School (1915&#150;20), where he was a king's scholar and discovered a marked talent for acting (a significant element in his developed personality). After proceeding as an exhibitioner to Merton College, Oxford, in 1920, he took a lively part in the activities of the turbulent post-war undergraduate generation. His second-class honours in the school of modern history in 1923 reflected this, though they did less than justice to the proficiency in medieval studies that he acquired under the tuition of Arthur Johnson of All Souls. This was evidently recognized in his immediate appointment as lecturer in church history at Keble College. In his first year in this post he attended Wells Theological College, and was ordained deacon to the title of his college in 1924 and priest in 1925.<br>
<br>In 1926 he left Keble, and joined the small Anglican Benedictine community which was shortly to move from Pershore to Nashdom Abbey, Burnham, in Buckinghamshire. Though the timing for this was unexpectedly abrupt, the project had been forming in his mind for some while, and in time it was to give him the identity and stability he needed. His progress towards this goal, however, was far from smooth. Having been sent as a novice to the abbey's house in the Gold Coast Colony, he had to be invalided home in 1929; and his health played a part in his decision not to be professed in the following year, but to assume instead the status of an &#145;intern oblate&#146;. In the seven years for which this continued he laid the foundations of his patristic and liturgical scholarship. In 1936 he re-entered the novitiate and in 1940 he was solemnly professed.<br>
<br>From this time onwards Dix's activity was increasingly in the public arena. He shared the papalist stance with which his monastery was associated; but he also saw it as his vocation to reclaim for the church of his baptism&#151;as a whole&#151;a Catholic character which Rome could recognize as such, and to prevent it from travelling down paths which would preclude this. Among the latter, in his eyes, were current proposals for church union in south India (and the possibility of their being used as a model for England). He masterminded a public campaign against these, with repeated lobbying of Archbishop William Temple (who remained nevertheless a revered friend); in the time of Temple's successor the resistance was conducted from the lower house of convocation after his election in 1945. There he skilfully exploited the inferior clergy's traditional suspicion of the motives of their bishops, and won a substantial measure of confidence. But the bitterness of the campaign soured the spirits of lesser men, and the time and energy that Dix devoted to ecclesiastical politics was ultimately to the detriment of his writing, and probably also his health. A by-product of the campaign, and one that well illustrates both the strengths and the weaknesses of his scholarship, was his essay on the ministry in the early church in the collection <span class="italic">The Apostolic Ministry</span> (1946), which he persuaded his close friend and ally K. E. Kirk, bishop of Oxford, to edit.<br>
<br>Dix's attraction to liturgical studies had begun long before this time, though the course it took did not remain unaffected. His first major publication in this field was his critical text (1937) of the <span class="italic">Apostolic Tradition</span> of Hippolytus of Rome, which had come to light through the researches of Dom R. H. Connolly some twenty years earlier. Dix was a pioneer in his emphasis (some would now say overemphasis) on the importance of this document for the early history of the liturgy, and his edition was a milestone towards a definitive reconstruction, though the final result is likely to look rather different. His text was to have been followed by a commentary, but that was shelved in favour of the more ambitious project for which he is most widely known, <span class="italic">The Shape of the Liturgy</span> (1945). Written with verve, imagination, and often mischievous humour, and in places with real eloquence, this is an outstanding piece of <i>haute vulgarisation</i>, liturgy made accessible to the general reader. Yet it could only have been produced by a master of his subject. Its breadth of insight decisively altered the scope and the course of liturgical reform both within and beyond the Church of England. And despite the haste of its composition under wartime conditions, and the proportion of bold solutions to individual questions which have not stood the test of time, it is still unreplaced as a unified vision of what Christian liturgy is really about.<br>
<br>Dix is remembered as a wit and lover of paradox, as a superb (and irrepressible) raconteur, and as a deliverer of devastating put-downs to tendentious scholarship or episcopal self-importance. Beneath the surface there was genuine spiritual conviction and a rare capacity for friendship. Little of substance came from his pen after 1946. Besides his convocation work he was increasingly concerned with the affairs of his abbey (of which he became prior in 1948), particularly the demands of its daughter foundation in the United States, to which he paid two extended visits. On the second of these, after he had committed himself to raising funds for a new chapel by an extensive programme of lecturing, and with building already in progress, an intestinal cancer was diagnosed. Seeing no other alternative to bankruptcy for the daughter house, he postponed surgery for eight months while the money was raised. The treatment was initially successful, but secondaries developed before his convalescence was complete, and he died at Grovefield House, Burnham, on 12 May 1952. He was buried on 16 May in the cemetery of Nashdom Abbey.<br>
