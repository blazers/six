<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martyn,  Henry</span>  (1781&#150;1812), <span class="occ">missionary and translator</span>, was born on 18 February 1781 in Truro, Cornwall, the third of the four children of John Martyn, a clerk in a merchant's office. His mother, his father's second wife, about whom little is known, died when he was two. The family's exact economic and social status remains uncertain, but Henry, delicate from childhood, was prepared for one of the professions through a sound classical education at Truro grammar school between 1788 and 1797, followed by university education at St John's College, Cambridge. By 1801, when he graduated as senior wrangler and winner of several prizes, he had proved his intellectual strengths, particularly in mathematics and Latin. In 1802, when he was elected a fellow at St John's, he seemed set for an academic or legal career.<br>
<br>The turning point in Martyn's life, which confirmed a missionary vocation already encouraged by the evangelical piety of his Cornwall home and the influence in particular of his younger sister, was occasioned by contact with Charles Simeon, the strongly evangelical vicar of Holy Trinity, Cambridge. Simeon's reports of the recent impact in Bengal of the first Baptist missionary to India, William Carey, and Martyn's own reading about new opportunities for overseas missionary work recently opened up by the evangelical revival and colonial expansion, stimulated his interest in overseas evangelism. After ordination as deacon in 1803, at Ely Cathedral, he nevertheless remained for a further two years in the Cambridge evangelical circle, working as Simeon's curate at Holy Trinity, with responsibility for a rural congregation. He took his MA degree in 1804, followed by a BD in 1806. Hopes of a full missionary posting to India had meanwhile been dashed when responsibility for an unmarried sister, following the loss of family property, obliged Martyn to accept the better-paid post of chaplain in the East India Company's rapidly expanding Bengal presidency. While awaiting departure he returned briefly to Cornwall, where his love for a local woman, Lydia Grenfell, six years his senior and also strongly evangelical, was revived. Failure to overcome his grief at her refusal to accompany him to India, though they were to maintain a close correspondence, was one of the factors responsible for his intermittent depressions.<br>
<br>Martyn reached Calcutta in early 1806 but found the British capital's dominance by worldly Europeans uncongenial to his evangelical temperament. He was posted for the next four years to military cantonments on the middle Ganges: first at Dinapore, near Patna, in Bihar, from 1806 to 1809; and second, until 1810, at Cawnpore, a busy trading city. Employed to serve the British community's ecclesiastical needs, he was prohibited by the Company's &#145;neutrality&#146; pledge from engaging in evangelistic activity among Indians; however, he managed to open some schools. There were scarcely any converts in this region during his lifetime, though an influential early Indian Muslim convert to Christianity, the Revd &#145;Abd al-Masih, later attributed his subsequent baptism, soon after Martyn's departure, to overhearing by chance a sermon given by the chaplain. In spite of the prohibition of direct preaching in the bazaars, the presence in Calcutta and at a neighbouring cantonment of some likeminded &#145;pious chaplains&#146;, notably David Brown and Daniel Corrie, who were also in communication with the Simeonites in Cambridge, provided an evangelical network which proved supportive to Martyn's self-deprecating temperament. Led by Brown they planned for the future evangelization of the region. By mutual agreement Martyn abandoned the study of Sanskrit, which was in any case less congenial to him, to concentrate on learning Arabic, Persian, and also Hindustani (Urdu), the principal vernacular of north India, which, with the help of a leading orientalist scholar, John Gilchrist, he had already begun in England. Assisted by local munshis (translators), Martyn put his outstanding linguistic skills to immediate use in translating the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into these three languages, for distribution in the Arabic script among the Muslims of India and the Middle East. However, suffering from a recurrence of tuberculosis, which made preaching increasingly painful, and despairing of conversions in north India, he decided that Arabia and Persia would provide a more congenial environment, free of colonial restraints, to improve his translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into the languages of the Islamic world. Having obtained leave to travel via Calcutta and Bombay, he left north India in October 1810.<br>
<br>Martyn was proved correct, for the revised Persian manuscript of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was rapidly completed in 1811&#150;12 in Shiraz, where he also engaged local scholars and Sufis in discussions about the nature and proofs of religious truth. He compiled two tracts in Persian in reply to the evidences for Islam, particularly from miracles, proposed by these scholars, and a third work entitled &#145;On the vanity of the Sofee system and on the truth of the religion of Moses and Jesus&#146;. Yet despite the seemingly more receptive atmosphere, resistance to conversion was just as strong as in India, leading within a few months to Martyn's departure. Apart from his anxiety to complete further revisions of the scriptures and to ensure their publication in the Arab world as well as in India and Persia, Martyn's by now frenetic journey westward was impelled by hopes of a further meeting with Lydia Grenfell. However, on 16 October 1812 he died a lonely death from tuberculosis at Tokat in Anatolia, <i>en route</i> for Constantinople. He was thirty-one. He was buried in an Armenian graveyard; his grave monument is now in Tokat Museum.<br>
<br>In his efforts &#145;to burn himself out for God&#146;, Martyn set himself goals which were unrealistic. His evangelical certainties distorted his perceptions of Islam, whose beliefs and practices he denigrated, like most missionaries of his generation. Some contemporaries thought that he was temperamentally, as well as physically, unsuited to the role of itinerant missionary. Nevertheless, Martyn's long-term influence has been very significant. His Urdu <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, usually regarded as his greatest contribution to evangelical objectives, was published in Bengal in 1814. The British ambassador to Persia, Sir Gore Ousley, who sympathized with Martyn's aims, presented his Persian <span class="roman">New Testament</span> to the shah of Persia and also sent it to St Petersburg where it was printed in 1815. The manuscript of the Arabic <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, which was with Martyn at his death, was forwarded to Charles Simeon in Cambridge, who ensured its publication in Calcutta in 1816. The <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was thus made available to missionary societies in the languages known to Muslims immediately after the easing in 1813 of the East India Company's embargo on evangelical activity. The impact was most direct in India, where re-editions of Martyn's <span class="roman">Bible</span> translations were published repeatedly, with various revisions, until the late nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In addition, Martyn's &#145;Persian tracts&#146;, generated in discussion with scholars in Shiraz, eventually came to missionary attention through their inclusion in Professor Samuel Lee's <span class="italic">Controversial Tracts on Christianity and Mohammedanism</span> (1824). These tracts, which emphasized a rational, evidential approach to apologetics, dictated by Martyn's Persian discussants rather than by his own preference for the &#145;word&#146; of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, seemed increasingly inappropriate in the high evangelical age, whose missionaries sought exclusively biblical tests for truth. Some influential Indian missionaries of the mid-nineteenth century, including Karl Pfander in Agra, and John Wilson in Bombay, acknowledged their debts to his apologetic writings, but other critics in India ridiculed his seriousness. Martyn's private journals, in which he recorded a deep conviction of his spiritual unworthiness, suggest a despondent personality. In contrast his evangelical friends, notably the children's novelist Mrs Sherwood, stressed his cheerfulness, and some company officials who disapproved of his evangelical objectives nevertheless valued his company for his conversational powers and good humour. In Anglican evangelical tradition he is remembered as &#145;saint and scholar: the first modern missionary to the Mohammedans&#146; (the sub-title of George Smith's biography of 1892), a perception which underlies more recent biographies. Further critical evaluation is awaited of his contribution to Biblical translation and of his relations with Muslims.<br>
