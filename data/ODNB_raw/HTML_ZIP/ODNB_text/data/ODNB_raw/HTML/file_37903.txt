<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robins,  Elizabeth</span>  (1862&#150;1952), <span class="occ">actress, writer, and feminist</span>, was born at East Walnut Street, Louisville, Kentucky, on 6 August 1862, the eldest daughter of Charles Ephraim Robins (1832&#150;1893), insurance broker and banker, and his cousin and wife, Hannah Maria Crow (1836&#150;1901). Childhood was punctuated by family deaths and dissension. Her half-brother died in adolescence, and one of four brothers died in infancy, as did a sister (the other died aged twenty). The birth of her youngest brother, Raymond, with whom she had a sustained intense relationship, presaged her mother's mental decline. Her father's restlessness signalled further dislocation. From the age of three until she was ten Robins lived on Staten Island, New York, then on her parents' separation she moved to her paternal grandmother in Zanesville, Ohio. By 1885 her mother was institutionalized, dying in an asylum in 1901.<br>
<br>Grandmother Jane Hussey Robins did, however, provide vital stability and inspiration. A thinly disguised, loving portrait of her exists in Robins's epic novel, <span class="italic">The Open Question</span> (1898). Putnam Seminary for Young Ladies gave Robins a sound education and introduced her to drama. Following a spell with her father, now a financial agent in a mining camp in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, she turned to the New York stage rather than acting <i>in loco parentis</i> for younger siblings. Only nineteen, lacking training, financial support, or connections she nevertheless persevered, taking the stage name of Claire Raymond, and was aided (and hindered) by good looks and the chance discovery of a wealthy relative. She spent several years at the renowned Boston Museum Company, where she met George Richmond Parks (<i>b</i>. 1856), an actor, whom she married in 1885. They had no children. Prone to depression and jealous of his wife's minor successes, he drowned himself in 1887. Distraught, Robins immersed herself in Shakespearian roles, undertaking a punishing coast to coast tour with the veteran actors Lawrence Barrett and Edwin Booth.<br>
<br>Robins accompanied the widow and daughter of the violinist Ole Bull to Norway in 1888. Stopping in London <i>en route</i> for home, she was captivated by the stage. Oscar Wilde and actor&#150;managers made encouraging noises and she postponed her return passage indefinitely. Although a highly experienced actress, she was unknown in Britain. A tough couple of years understudying, playing mediocre roles, and surviving shabby digs are recollected in her memoir <span class="italic">Both Sides of the Curtain</span>. Her fortunes changed as Ibsen's prose dramas reached the British stage. Captivated by <span class="italic">A Doll's House</span>, by January 1891 she was herself playing the role of the young widow, Mrs Linden. But it was her production of and leading part in <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> three months later which made Robins and Ibsen household names among the British theatregoing public. She and the American actress Marion Lea raised money to produce it at the Vaudeville Theatre. The <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> called it &#145;One of the most notable events in the history of the modern stage&#146;  (26 April 1891). Even anti-Ibsenites acknowledged the power of her performance.<br>
<br>Another pioneering Ibsen role (and Robins's personal favourite) was Hilda Wangel in <span class="italic">The Master Builder</span> (1893), which she also stage managed with help from her lover, the Ibsen translator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30435/', "William Archer (1856&#150;1924)")</script>. Mrs Patrick Campbell called her performance &#145;the most intellectually comprehensive piece of work I had seen on the English stage&#146;  (B. S. Campbell, <span class="italic">My Life and some Letters</span>, 1922, 65). Both women acted in <span class="italic">Little Eyolf</span> (1896), in the Ibsen&#150;Echegaray subscription series launched by Robins and Archer to promote non-commercial European theatre with decent roles for women. This aim found fuller expression in their founding of the New Century Theatre.<br>
<br>Anxious about being typecast as an Ibsenite actress, Robins also acted in plays by other dramatists, such as her compatriot Henry James's <span class="italic">The American</span>. Their companionship was celebrated in her book <span class="italic">Theatre and Friendship</span> (1932). This additionally paid tribute to her friend Florence Bell. Robins and Bell co-scripted anonymously <span class="italic">Alan's Wife</span> (1893), a play about infanticide, based on a Swedish story.<br>
<br>Robins's best-known play was <span class="italic">Votes for Women!</span> (1907), credited with inaugurating suffrage drama. Researching this turned her from interested observer into committed participant and produced the novel <span class="italic">The Convert</span> (1907). Reprinted in the 1980s, this book helped revive Robins's name after a period of neglect.<br>
<br>In the 1890s her incipient feminism had been fuelled by witnessing the exploitation of actresses by actor&#150;managers and by Ibsen's depiction of strong-minded women. Yet not until the Edwardian period was she prepared to name herself a suffragist. Even then she moved cautiously from constitutionalist to militant. Although on the executive of the Women's Social and Political Union between 1907 and 1912, she never participated directly in militancy. Nevertheless, she penned some vitriolic prose, which can be sampled in her book <span class="italic">Way Stations</span> (1913), one of the first histories of the cause. She had retired from the stage in 1902 but was an inspiring platform speaker.<br>
<br>Now earning her living entirely by writing, Robins was first president of the Women Writers' Suffrage League. Aware of the precariousness of the stage as a profession for women and supporting her impecunious family, she had been writing and selling stories since the 1880s. Her early novels, such as <span class="italic">George Mandeville's Husband</span> (1894), published by her admirer William Heinemann, were pseudonymous but C. E. Raimond's identity was revealed after her first real success, <span class="italic">The Open Question</span>. Robins published fourteen novels and two collections of short stories. Although her fiction tackled <i>risqu&eacute;</i> social issues such as suicide and prostitution, her best-seller was an innocuous adventure story of gold-seeking men. <span class="italic">The Magnetic North</span> (1904), written after her own intrepid journey to Alaska to find her brothers Saxton and Raymond, was based on the latter's experience in the Klondike.<br>
<br>Raymond Robins became a prominent human rights activist. From 1904 to 1925 he and his sister co-owned Chinsegut, a home in Florida. She initially visited frequently but after he married Margaret Dreier (president of the American Women's Trade Union League), relations became more strained.<br>
<br>Robins had a wide circle of friends including politicians such as Sir Edward Grey and writers like John Masefield and Virginia and Leonard Woolf. In 1909 she purchased a fifteenth-century house in Henfield, Sussex. Her constant companion during her last forty years was the pioneer doctor Octavia Wilberforce, whose professional development owed much to Robins's unstinting support. In 1927 they converted Robins's home into a rest place for women recuperating from stress and illness, administered by the Backsettown Trust until 1989. Robins moved to Wilberforce's home in Brighton. In the 1920s she was one of the original directors of the feminist periodical <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> and a vice-president of the Six Point Group. Her non-fiction included an anonymous polemic, <span class="italic">Ancilla's Share</span> (1924) and the pamphlet <span class="italic">Ibsen and the Actress</span> (1928). The latter was published by the Hogarth Press, and Virginia and Leonard Woolf knew her well in later years. Virginia thought her a great, but essentially a pre-First World War writer, and enjoyed reading her manuscript reminiscences, published as <span class="italic">Both Sides of the Curtain</span> by Heinemann in 1940.<br>
<br>Robins retained American citizenship. Somewhat disillusioned with the modern world, she spent the Second World War in the USA. Physically weak yet determined to keep going, at the age of eighty-eight she flew across the Atlantic. She had begun a diary in 1876. It had grown into a crucial, though carefully crafted, part of her daily life (over seventy volumes of it have been preserved in her papers at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library of New York University). It continued until just before her death at her home, 24 Montpelier Crescent, Brighton, on 8 May 1952, in her ninetieth year. Her body was cremated in Brighton.<br>
