<span class="headword">Mac Cearbhaill,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1289), <span class="occ">archbishop of Cashel</span>, held the archbishopric from 1253 until his death in 1289. Before his episcopal appointment he held the deanery of Cashel, but apart from this virtually nothing is known of his early career. His family background was predominantly Irish and his election was opposed by Henry III on the grounds of his affinity with the king's enemies. Pope Innocent IV confirmed his election in August 1254 and royal assent was eventually obtained in February 1255. The new archbishop did fealty to the king in person and was consecrated in Cashel in the summer of 1255.<br>
<br>One of Mac Cearbhaill's earliest actions as archbishop was to hold a provincial council at which various disputes with his suffragan bishops and clergy were settled. Nevertheless, in the following years Archbishop David was involved in serious quarrels with both the suffragan bishop of Lismore and the dean of Cashel. His reputation as a contentious prelate is given further substantiation by the events of 1266, when he confirmed, and in one case consecrated, suffragan bishops before royal assent had been obtained. In 1267 he was summoned into the king's presence and pardoned for these offences.<br>
<br>The archbishop had strong sympathies with the Cistercian tradition. In 1255 he had petitioned the general chapter for permission to have the services of two Cistercian monks to help him in his administration. In 1269, fourteen years after his consecration, he himself took the habit of a Cistercian monk. This marked a turning point in his career and he became very involved in the affairs of that order. In 1272, having removed a Benedictine community, he founded Hore Abbey in Cashel, bringing monks from Mellifont. In 1274 he attended the chapter general at C&icirc;teaux and was granted his petition that all the daughter houses removed from Mellifont's jurisdiction by Abbot Lexington in 1228 were to be restored.<br>
<br>In this same year the archbishop was present at the Council of Lyons; and he made a vow to go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land which he does not appear to have fulfilled. He was in England in January 1275 and then returned to Ireland to oversee the reorganization of the Cistercian houses. He provoked the hostility of many of the English in Ireland who complained of his anti-English sentiments and actions. It was alleged that his abbey in Cashel was full of rogues who killed English people and that the archbishop had made an Irish boy of twenty-two years bishop of Cork, to humiliate the English. His personal relations with the king, however, appear to have been cordial and despite being branded anti-English he was one of the prime movers in the unsuccessful attempts in the period 1277&#150;81 to extend English law to the Irish. With his suffragan bishops of Emly and Killaloe, he spent the best part of four years in England negotiating with royal officials. Together with five other bishops of the Cashel province they pledged all their temporalities to guarantee payment of the proposed fine of 10,000 marks. When the negotiations broke down, Mac Cearbhaill returned to Cashel. Little is known of the last six years of his life. He died in Cashel on 1 August 1289 and may have been buried in Hore Abbey.<br>
<br>Although the evidence points to Mac Cearbhaill having been a quarrelsome prelate, he also emerges as able and courageous. He placed himself firmly within native Irish ecclesiastical tradition, while at the same time attempting to establish a working relationship with the crown. The contradictory evidence of his career is, in the words of J. Watt, &#145;an expression of the conflict facing every Irish prelate who ministered in the <i>terre Engleis</i>&#146;  (Watt, 160).<br>
