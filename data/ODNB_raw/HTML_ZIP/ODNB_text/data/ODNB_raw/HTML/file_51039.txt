<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Franks,  Oliver Shewell</span>, Baron Franks  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">philosopher and public servant</span>, was born on 16 February 1905 at Woodbrooke settlement, Selly Oak, Birmingham, the elder son and oldest of four children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33246/', "Revd Dr Robert Sleightholme Franks (1871&#150;1964)")</script>, scholar and theologian, and his wife, Katharine 
    (Kitty; 1875&#150;1971)
  , daughter of Joseph Shewell, of Redcar, Yorkshire, an engineer and iron bridge builder. Profoundly reasonable and publicly austere, a figure of immense moral authority, Oliver Franks lived an exceptional life. He did not seek his various careers of don, mandarin, diplomat, banker, provost, pillar of state. They sought him. He did not collect committees, as some men do. Committees collected him. He did not pine for public recognition. Recognition came to him. He bore an uncanny resemblance to Aristotle's magnanimous man, &#145;moderately disposed towards wealth, power, and every kind of good and bad fortune, however it befalls him&#146;. Franks was made for magnanimity:<blockquote>He does not enter for popular contests, or ones in which others distinguish themselves; he hangs back or does nothing at all, except where the honour or the feat is a great one. The tasks he undertakes are few, but grand and celebrated. (Quoted in Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 195)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Religionandpolitics"></a>Religion and politics</h2>Franks was a philosopher king with a nonconformist conscience. &#145;The Establishment smites the Establishment&#146;, proclaimed a commentator on one of his multifarious Franks reports  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 198), a fine phrase but a doubtful verdict. When it came to establishments he was in them but not of them. In a life almost coterminous with the century&#151;he was highly attuned to the patterns of the past, especially to the <i>longue dur&eacute;e</i> of Fernand Braudel, his favourite historian&#151;Franks swam peaceably in the two streams of English dissent that were his birthright: the Congregational church and the Religious Society of Friends. His father was a Congregational minister, like his father before him; his mother was a Quaker from a family of Quakers. His upbringing was uplifting. A mettlesome air of intellectual enquiry pervaded the entire household. Oliver and his sisters and brother were expected to think&#151;think hard&#151;for themselves. Mealtimes were feasts of conversation. Robert Franks did not read the newspaper at breakfast; the family talked&#151;talked about everything from the flowers in the fields to the Channel Fleet. They weighed words and knew their meaning. They analysed articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. On Sundays they dissected the sermon they had heard. The opinions were sensible, but the talk was unrestrained. This was a liberal household in more senses than one.<br>
<br>Politically they were staunch believers in the unimpeachable virtue of Mr Gladstone&#151;in moments of hilarity, the GOM (Grand Old Man). They voted Liberal, always; the children followed suit. Young Oliver, aged five, sported a loyal rosette at the general election of 1910. Old Oliver was not so ostentatious. In the 1930s he was politically engaged, briefly, in the Oxford Movement for the Propagation of Peace, a comprehensively lost cause. In the 1940s and 1950s he attended meetings of XYZ, a clandestine dining club of Labour supporters and sympathizers in the City, whose stalwarts included Hugh Dalton, Evan Durbin, Hugh Gaitskell, Douglas Jay, and the self-styled liberal&#150;socialist economist James Meade, a close friend. XYZ had a strong Fabian flavour, and there was indeed something of the Fabian about Oliver Franks. He would build a new Jerusalem; and he would repine for its soul. Typically, he was not an XYZ member as such, more a benevolent assessor. In party political terms, during the period of his most active public service he was concerned to preserve his status as &#145;a neuter&#146; as he put it  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 174). Ennobled in 1962, he took the Liberal whip, as expected, though in unmistakable cross-bench fashion his sponsors were a civil servant and a judge. Thereafter he permitted himself the occasional foray into national politics, chairing election meetings of the Oxford Liberals in 1963 and 1964, and addressing a Liberal Party rally at the Oxford Union in favour of a decisive vote to remain in the EEC in the referendum of 1975. In later life he was given to describing himself as &#145;an unreconstructed Gladstonian Liberal&#146;; in playful mood he might even suggest that he and Lord Gladwyn (the former Gladwyn Jebb) were the only ones left, a conceit in which the latter was happy to share. Just how Liberal he was, or became, is a moot point. Unquestionably party meant little to him. Party politics was too much of a game, too often trivial or reprehensible&#151;not serious. There was a touch of disdain in Franks's contemplation of the political stew. During the intervals of his Falklands inquiry in 1982 he would sit back and listen as &#145;the parliamentarians cracked their silly parliamentary jokes&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 28&#150;9). It was an attitude reminiscent of Demodocus on the Milesians:<blockquote>
<div>Milesians are not stupid, I aver;<br>
</div>
<div>But they behave the same as if they were.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Franks was a mugwump. He disliked labels, but it may be appropriate to adapt the one he gave himself. He was, if anything, an unreconstructed Liberal internationalist.<h2>
<a name="ModsandGreats"></a>Mods and Greats</h2>In 1910 the Franks family moved from Birmingham to Bristol, where Oliver's father became principal of the Western College, and Oliver became a west countryman. After a couple of dismal dame-schools he went to Bristol grammar school (1915&#150;23). His progress offers no crumb of comfort to those who like their great men to be school dunces. Every year with monotonous regularity he carried off the form prize. He departed the classical sixth with prizes in English literature, Latin, and Greek testament. Inevitably, he was school captain. At his second attempt, to the delight of the whole family, he won an open scholarship in classics to Queen's College, Oxford (1923&#150;7).<br>
<br>To his fellow students he was Father Franks, preternaturally wise, solemn, seclusive, masterful. At the outset, however, he was not so secure, intellectually or financially. &#145;At Oxford in the 1920s we were either rich or poor&#146;, wrote Douglas Jay, a near contemporary  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 16). Franks was poor. He did not join the Oxford Union because he could not afford to. He went to the occasional free concert, and once a term to the sixpenny seats in the cinema. He took up rowing, frugally, and persevered, despite &#145;much <i>alg&#333; ton orron</i> [pain in the arse]&#146;  (ibid., 16). On Sundays he went, &#145;all good&#146;, to chapel at Mansfield College, almost a family foundation. Two years into his degree came the event which confirmed him to himself: moderations&#151;the first public examination in <i>literae humaniores</i>&#151;fifteen papers in everything from Aristophanes to Virgil. He prepared himself for this test with exemplary thoroughness. &#145;With the approach of Mods&#146;, reported his old school magazine, &#145;Mr Franks has withdrawn into an anchorite's seclusion, whence he only occasionally emerges, wearing the most remarkable stockings.&#146; The results were spectacular: fourteen alphas and a solitary beta in Latin prose, some of the highest marks in the whole university, and the best first at Queen's since the First World War. &#145;Did not Mr Franks collect innumerable alphas in his recent encounter? Does he not now read paperbacks upon the river? Is not that the manifestation of real genius?&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 17&#150;18).<br>
<br>After that Franks never looked back. Moderations were followed by Greats&#151;two years of philosophy and ancient history. Franks read prodigiously, as usual, encouraged by his father's example and conversation:<blockquote>Mr Franks has become almost a legendary figure. There appear to be some doubts of his tangible existence at Queen's. One fact only has penetrated to us. Mr Franks, with characteristic wisdom, is reading St Thomas Aquinas for that most soul-destroying of all ordeals, Greats. We commend his example, for here is balm for the tortured spirit. (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 19)</blockquote>In 1927, in swift succession, the wise Mr Franks took a congratulatory first, a fellowship at Queen's, and a year's leave of absence, &#145;to go to Europe and grow older&#146;. He travelled in Germany, Austria, and Italy, where he was arrested by Mussolini's police in possession of Plato's <span class="italic">Republic</span>&#151;the very book in which Socrates makes the argument that &#145;there will be no end to the troubles of states, or indeed &hellip; of humanity itself, till philosophers become kings in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers&#146;  (quoted in Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 24). The arrest of the tyro philosopher by the myrmidons of <i>Il Duce</i> is a fine thing to contemplate.<h2>
<a name="Philosophyandfriendship"></a>Philosophy and friendship</h2>Back in Oxford, Franks began plying his trade. He wrote almost nothing, but he was an outstanding college tutor. One of his first pupils was a woman from Lady Margaret Hall&#151;Barbara Tanner&#151;reading the new combination of philosophy, politics, and economics (a combination which Franks did much to make academically respectable). It so happened that she and Franks were already acquainted. Their relationship developed, as it were, philosophically. They married at Redland Friends' meeting-house in Bristol on 3 July 1931, and remained the best of friends for nearly sixty years. It was a friendship of an appropriately Aristotelian cast.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_89944"></a><span class="headword">Barbara Mary Franks</span>  (1907&#150;1987)<span class="occ"></span> was the eldest child and only daughter of Herbert George Tanner (1882&#150;1974), of Llanfoist, Clifton Down, Bristol, businessman and magistrate, and Agatha Mary Gales (1877&#150;1957), daughter of a Liberal electoral agent and peace activist. Barbara had been weaned on good organization and good causes. The Tanners were teetotallers, vegetarians, non-smokers, pacifists, nonconformists, and Liberals. Her mother was a Quaker by upbringing; her father became one by conviction after the war. Barbara herself had been to Sidcot, the co-educational Quaker school at Winscombe, Somerset, where her grandparents had been (and where Franks's parents settled in retirement). In youth as in maturity she had both sense and sensibility. She also had a keen social conscience, and an impulsion to act. Her commitment to public service antedated that of her husband; in this respect, as perhaps in others, it was he who learned from her. Already in the 1930s she was serving on the committee of the Eye Hospital in Oxford, and organizing the Plantation Club for poor girls in the Gorbals, Glasgow. She also acted from time to time as research assistant to Sir George Clark, the historian. During the Second World War she worked first for the press research department of the Foreign Office, and then for the Women's Voluntary Service. After the war family movements enforced a break in such activities, but no sooner were they re-established in Oxford in the 1950s than she began an intensive involvement in the social provision of the city. Signally, she was a magistrate for twenty-two years, by common consent an outstanding chairman of the city bench, compassionate, expeditious, and fair. She also served as a member of the board of governors of Aylesbury and Oxford prisons, Huntercombe borstal, Campsfield detention centre, and a local probation hostel; chairman of the local Citizens' Advice Bureau and of Age Concern; a trustee of Oxfam; an independent member of two wages councils; and chairman of the management committee of the Nuffield Orthopaedic Hospital.<br>
<br>Oliver Franks and Barbara Tanner were fundamentally compatible people. They shared the same values in life and the same belief in religion as relevant to the living of it. For Franks that was what was most important in the marriage. At the heart of this was a certain simplicity, evident in the pastimes they shared: gardening, reading, walking, shrimping in the Isles of Scilly. Franks was proud of his wife's distinction on the bench, proud that she held the same office as her father and grandfather before her. It appealed to his sense of the fitness of things. They both took great pleasure in the generational continuity, and in the more equal opportunity it betokened. There was a mutual respect between them. If she was not his intellectual equal, in human terms he was if anything overmatched. In general she ranged further than he. Her Quaker sympathies were deeper, her pacifist leanings stronger. In middle age she lost her shyness but retained her modesty. She practised yoga and tai chi. She liked to meditate. At seventy-five she learned to stand on her head. She was her own woman, an expression she would probably have deplored. At the same time she supported her husband in everything he did, just as he supported her. This was not a matter of form, but a grave moral obligation. In the last ten years of her life she took up painting, with amazing success. She sought technical instruction and went on painting holidays in the south of France, revelling in the warmth and colour of the late summer. He supported her in that, making tea and chatting amiably to the assorted amateur artists who appeared in the house or set up their easels in the garden, before resuming his reading.<br>
<br>Franks consulted her on anything of consequence. Together they determined that he should not become Oxford-bound. It was decided that he should apply for the first available (and interesting) philosophy post in the UK. This happened to be the chair of moral philosophy at Glasgow, a chair previously occupied by none other than Adam Smith. It was the only job for which he ever made unsolicited application. The application was successful. They left Oxford in 1937. The new professor of moral philosophy was thirty-two. He was not long for the life of the mind.<h2>
<a name="Whitehallandwar"></a>Whitehall and war</h2>Franks had been at Glasgow for barely a year when he received a terse enquiry from Whitehall. &#145;Do you undertake to go wherever you are sent in the event of a national emergency?&#146; He replied in the affirmative. The question prompted some reflection, but no crisis of conscience. For Franks the Second World War was not a good war, but it was a necessary one. As he saw it, &#145;Hitler had to be squashed&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 39). If conscripted, he would have served. In the event he was immured for the duration in the Ministry of Supply (1939&#150;46). After that, as he later remarked, life was not the same. Squashing Hitler launched Franks into a new orbit. By the end of the war, in spite of his amateur status, he was permanent secretary, a feat equalled only by John Maud (later Baron Redcliffe-Maud) in the Ministry of Food. Success brought recognition. It was in these years that he made his reputation as an adjudicator, his most natural and effective role on the public stage. Stuart Hampshire has written:<blockquote>The work of practical reason is never finished, never final and secure. Surveying any tract of history, and looking into our own minds, we see the ebb and flow of contrary passions and interests needing to be reconciled; in the mind by that form of inner adjudication which is called reflection, and in the state by the literal and visible adjudication of parliaments and law courts, (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 43)</blockquote>and, one might add, Oliver Franks.<br>
<br>In consequence Franks became hot property. He was besought to remain at the Ministry of Supply; coveted by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Works; offered the National Coal Board, the flagship of the nationalized fleet. He wanted none of these. Approached with some trepidation, the new world of Whitehall had proved compelling, and in many ways congenial. Yet his kinship remained in some measure provisional. He was a temporary permanent secretary, as he liked to say, and he was in need of a restorative. The nationalized industries failed to light a spark. More than once in the post-war period he considered the possibility of working at the grindstones of politics and administration, most excruciatingly as governor of the Bank of England, only to reject it (after some hesitation) every time. In 1946 (the year in which he was made KCB), happily, he was offered a position he did want&#151;the only one, he said, that he ever really wanted&#151;a position for which he was apparently predestined, if not actually pre-elected, since before the war: provost of Queen's College, Oxford (1946&#150;8).<h2>
<a name="Diplomacyanddollars"></a>Diplomacy and dollars</h2>Free at last, Franks spent a year, in his words, &#145;frisking like a lamb in green pastures&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 57). Then came another summons. On 30 June 1947 he was given leave of absence from the college, &#145;to prepare a scheme for the comprehensive restoration of the economy of Europe on the lines adumbrated by Mr Marshall, the United States Secretary of State&#146;  (ibid., 57). The scheme was to be submitted by 1 September 1947. It was surely the largest long-vacation task ever undertaken.<br>
<br>The summons had come from the foreign secretary. Any explanation of Franks's galvanic influence on the international transformations of the mid-twentieth century must begin with his role as the special agent of Ernest Bevin. The tall, spare don and the short, squat docker were an unlikely combination, as Bevin himself pointed out. &#145;You, Oliver, 'ad a university experience. My experience is in the 'edgerows of life&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 52). The dissimilarity mattered not at all. Bevin had encountered Franks during the war, as minister of labour. He liked this sure-footed scholar, who could be of such help to him. One could rely on Franks, without obligation. He had no history. He was at once judicious and resourceful, masterly and discreet. For Bevin this was an extremely attractive proposition. On Franks's side the chemistry was simple. He approved of Bevin, and of what he was trying to do. He made no allowance for him, as so many did. He even joked about him, an unusual public sign of affection. &#145;The Secretary of State&#146;, he once informed the waiting Dean Acheson, &#145;is doing his own version of hurrying to the meeting&#146;  (ibid., 53).<br>
<br>It was Bevin who seized Marshall's lifeline and organized a collective response; Bevin who mooted a conference in Paris to determine how Europe should respond; Bevin who fingered Franks to get the job done; Bevin who left him to it. As chairman of the new-found Committee for European Economic Co-operation (the CEEC, later the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, OEEC, later still the OECD) and leader of the British delegation, Franks was given plenipotentiary powers and virtually no instructions. Essentially he had to shoehorn sixteen nations into one report, &#145;European availabilities and requirements&#146;, for the four years 1948&#150;51 in a matter of six weeks.<br>
<br>The exercise was a sore trial to all concerned (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK), regardless of the bounty it might bring. Among other things it called for figures and forecasts of a sophistication well beyond most national capabilities. At bottom, however, the problem facing the CEEC was not econometric but diplomatic. In William Diebold's words, &#145;the main job in Paris was finding some numbers that would pass muster in Washington&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 71): a problem of palatability, and hence of persuasion. That was where Father Franks came in.<br>
<br>The numbers initially produced in Paris, by census and aggregation, were highly unpalatable. For the sixteen countries plus western Germany they showed an accumulated balance of payments deficit of $29.2 billion over the four-year period in question&#151;the headline figure of dollar aid required, in the CEEC's estimation, for a sustainable European recovery programme. Of this global deficit no less than $28.2 billion was with the American continent: $8.1 billion in 1948 reducing annually to $5.8 billion in 1951. These numbers were shocking, not only because of their order of magnitude, but also because of their pessimistic outlook. $29 billion was a colossal sum, far exceeding Britain's aggregate international lending throughout the nineteenth century. For the United States it was out of the question, as the imperious under-secretary of state, William Clayton, immediately informed Franks. Marshall planners might not know the size of the Marshall plan, but they knew it had to be smaller than that. As disturbing was the clear intimation that the aid programme would not be sufficient to restore equilibrium after four years, as Washington hoped and expected. A deficit would remain, and with it the prospect of further importunings. When would the Europeans finally be able to stand on their own thirty-two feet?<br>
<br>Franks now had the measure of the problem. He held all the threads in his hands. Huddling separately with a small executive committee of the CEEC, a trusted member of Bevin's inner circle (Edmund Hall-Patch), and&#151;very privately&#151;key US officials offering &#145;friendly aid&#146;, he set about the necessary revising and recasting. With the help of a short postponement, this intensive diplomacy bore fruit. Miraculously the CEEC did produce a report, to which everyone was prevailed upon to subscribe. As to numbers, it was marvellously murky. The report dealt in dollar deficits. Dollar aid, it declared disingenuously, was a matter for the US. The &#145;tentatively estimated deficit&#146; with the American continent had shrunk to an accumulated total of $22.4 billion over the four-year period: $8 billion in 1948 reducing to $3.4 billion in 1951. If most capital equipment were shown (and financed) separately, as agreed, then the numbers became $19.3 billion, $7.1 billion, and $2.8 billion respectively. Moreover there was a &#145;tentatively estimated surplus&#146; with the rest of the world of $2.8 billion over the same period. For technical reasons the report doubted the possibility of offsetting this surplus against the dollar deficit, but merely to mention it was enough for enticingly small net figures to swim before the eyes.<br>
<br>These numbers passed muster on at least two counts. First and foremost, their order of magnitude was no longer scary. In Franksian parlance the European antithesis to Marshall's thesis was $19.3 billion. The administration's synthesis was $17 billion. The European recovery programme was presented for congressional approval in December 1947. In April 1948 a first tranche of $5 billion was made available for an initial twelve-month period. Of this the UK received no less than $1.24 billion, an unexpected satisfaction owing something to the calming presence of Franks. Second, the CEEC's numbers provided at least a fig leaf of cover for the future. The report concluded with the positive reassurance that the Americans demanded: &#145;Certainly the deficit after the end of 1951, on these assumptions, should be of dimensions which will be manageable without special aid&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 83). On this occasion, perhaps, Franksian principles were overborne.<br>
<br>The long vacation was over. The lines adumbrated by Marshall had been substantiated by Franks. It was a remarkable achievement. The foreign secretary's special agent had secured the first great transatlantic bargain of the post-war period.<h2>
<a name="GreeksandRomans"></a>Greeks and Romans</h2>Franks was not allowed to rest, but was offered instead the plum of the Washington embassy (1948&#150;52). The prime minister himself made the call. Franks accepted only after prolonged hesitation. He was loath to part with Queen's; Barbara was reluctant to leave Oxford. Yet they went. His own explanation is characteristic. &#145;In the end, the obvious dawned. Unless there is a proper objection of conscience, there are things it is not appropriate to refuse&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 89). The Stoic technical term for this is <i>kathekon</i> or appropriate action. Franks was a lapsed philosopher, but he consciously attended to the philosopher's question&#151;how should one live? He returned a Stoic answer. To live well was to live virtuously. Franks was a virtuous man who did not cultivate virtue, except perhaps to take a quiet pride in his own power of right judgement. He did what he thought right: that is, in Cicero's words, honourable and seemly. It would not have been seemly to refuse Clement Attlee, or for that matter Ernest Bevin.<br>
<br>Franks was sent to Washington with a specific purpose in mind. Bevin's attention had shifted from economic to military security. What he sought was an &#145;Atlantic pact&#146; of mutual assistance among the Western democracies. Here too the Europeans needed help. An Atlantic pact required an American commitment, ultimately a commitment to use force. For the heirs of George Washington to make such a commitment it was axiomatic that some moral stiffening would be needed. Who better than Franks to provide it?<br>
<br>The Atlantic pact became in due course the north Atlantic treaty (later the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO), signed with great fanfare in Washington in April 1949. It was the outcome of nine months of gruelling international negotiation. The principal negotiators were the ambassadors of Belgium, Canada, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the UK, partnered by the US secretary of state. In spite of his relative youth Franks swiftly attained a unique position in this company, becoming the unofficial moderator of the ambassadors, and ultimately the guarantor of the treaty on the European side&#151;a tribute to his qualities and his accomplishment. He was now a committee man of unbeatable experience. He had chaired not only the CEEC, but also the governing body of an Oxford college, compared to which, he observed, the Europeans were child's play.<br>
<br>The crux of the treaty was the pledge, the provision for collective defence against armed attack: one for all and all for one. The form of words embodying this provision evolved through a number of sinuous but significant compromises, and occasioned the most rancorous (and fundamental) disputes between the Europeans and the Americans. The basic elements were well stated by the Canadian diplomat Escott Reid:<blockquote>The firmer the pledge, the greater the effect the treaty might be expected to have in deterring the Soviet Union and in restoring in Western Europe the confidence necessary for its recovery. The weaker the pledge, the less reluctant the senate would be to ratify the treaty. (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 100)</blockquote>The Europeans tended to emphasize the first consideration, the Americans the second. By February 1949, after seven months of negotiation, they arrived at an impasse. Those who wanted a treaty (a majority) despaired of a strong pledge; those who wanted a strong pledge (another majority) despaired of a treaty. At this juncture the incoming secretary of state, Dean Acheson, made his famous &#145;unorthodox proposal&#146; to Franks:<blockquote>On an experimental basis I suggested that we talk regularly, and in complete personal confidence, about any international problems we saw arising. Neither would report or quote the other unless, thinking it would be useful in promoting action, he got the other's consent and agreement on the terms of a reporting memorandum or cable. &hellip; We met alone, usually at his residence or mine, at the end of the day before or after dinner. No one was informed even of the fact of the meeting. We discussed situations already emerging or likely to do so, the attitudes that various people in both countries would be likely to take, what courses of action were possible and their merits, the chief problems that could arise. If either thought that his department should be alerted to the other's apprehensions and thoughts, we would work out an acceptable text setting out the problem and suggesting approaches. (ibid., 104)</blockquote>In this spirit Franks and Acheson re-examined the pledge from first principles. They disassembled all the pieces and together constructed a new form of words&#151;&#145;a bit of redrafting to ease the constitutional sensibilities of the Congress&#146;, as Franks put it later  (ibid., 104). It read:<blockquote>The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe and North America shall be considered an armed attack against them all; and consequently that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith such action including the use of armed force, individually and in concert with the other parties, as it deems necessary to restore and assure the security of the North Atlantic area. (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 105)</blockquote>This bit of redrafting did the trick. The impasse was broken. The negotiations were swiftly concluded. With one minor transposition, the draft concocted <i>&agrave; deux</i> by Franks and Acheson became the keystone of the North Atlantic treaty. It has remained in place ever since.<br>
<br>An entangling alliance had been created, against the weight of history. As Bevin reported to the cabinet, American readiness &#145;to enter into a commitment to defend Europe in time of peace marked a revolutionary step in their policy&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 107). Appropriately enough, it was the old firm of Bevin and Franks who signed for the UK. Bevin was exuberant. The North Atlantic treaty was his crowning achievement as foreign secretary. It was the second great transatlantic bargain of the post-war period. It too was secured by Franks.<br>
<br>Just as Franks had been an amateur mandarin, so he was an amateur diplomat. It was a career refrain. He might have been a professional philosopher, but in retrospect the message is clear: philosophy was not enough. Franks was a lifelong layman&#151;the most distinguished of his day. He seems to have relished that status. He was interested in the subject at hand, whatever it was. He was unlearned but educable. He was knowledgeable on cognate matters. He was inquisitive, purposive, co-operative. He had a remarkable talent for finding the right level of detail. He was flexible (not biddable), and generally unprejudiced. He listened to what he was told; his opinions, however, were his own. This whole profile was immensely reassuring, in London and Washington alike. The consummate Dean Acheson, for one, was not easily impressed; but his unorthodox proposal tells its own story. The quality and scope of the relationship between Franks and Acheson, as ambassador and secretary of state, is unparalleled in American history, and likely to remain so. It meant that Franks could become a participant in internal American deliberations; it was in fact the hard currency of the much mythologized special relationship. Franks reflected:<blockquote>The special relationship was not a mystique of the shared inheritance of the English-speaking peoples. It arose out of common aims and mutual need of each other; it was rooted in strong habits of working together on which there was supervened the sentiments of mutual trust. (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 121)</blockquote>He had no time for the patronizing game played by so many of his countrymen, the game of Greeks and Romans. Acheson and his advisers were not lacking in Greek wisdom. What they required was efficacy. &#145;In the Anglo-American relationship&#146;, Franks observed wisely, &#145;British policy has to pass the test: can the British deliver?&#146;  (ibid., 88).<br>
<br>Franks was as efficacious as any. It was very largely on his urging and his argument&#151;&#145;the Americans will to some extent &hellip; test the quality of the partnership by our attitude to the notion of a token ground force&#146;&#151;that the British government overcame its reluctance and committed a brigade group to Korea in 1950, as &#145;a valuable contribution to Anglo-American solidarity&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 127). It was his formulations, delphic as they were, which governed nuclear consultation between the two countries, and which became part of the essential grammar of Anglo-American relations during the cold war. With regard to the delicate question of US bases in the UK, for example, he provided the &#145;joint decision&#146; formula of 1951: &#145;The use of these bases in an emergency would be a matter for joint decision by His Majesty's Government and the United States Government in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time.&#146; From the British point of view these transactions surely left something to be desired, yet no one, not even Winston Churchill, was able to improve upon them. As Acheson's special assistant remarked of the joint decision formula, &#145;the agreement was as precise as anyone could make it&#151;as precise as anyone wanted it to be&#151;but there was still &hellip; ambiguity there that served everybody's interests &hellip; and needs&#146;  (ibid., 134).<h2>
<a name="Greatandgood"></a>Great and good</h2>Franks chose to depart the diplomatic life in 1952. He was pressed to become the first secretary-general of NATO, a natural transition, but at length accepted a more unexpected offer, the chairmanship of Lloyds Bank, the largest of the London clearing houses (1954&#150;62). Franks offered Lloyds his moral eminence, in Gordon Richardson's phrase, and his administrative gift. Lloyds offered Franks a vantage point from which to observe the world. It paid handsomely&#151;far more than any other position he ever held&#151;and it allowed full scope for his burgeoning practice of public adjudication. This took the characteristic form of an official inquiry, followed by a report. Soon he appeared to be in session almost continuously. He chaired two major inquiries&#151;on administrative tribunals and inquiries (1955&#150;7) and on Oxford University (1964&#150;6)&#151;and played a leading part in a third, on the working of the monetary system (1957&#150;9), under Lord Radcliffe. More followed. In 1971&#150;2, at the request of the home secretary, Franks inquired into the controversial catch-all section 2 of the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> of 1911; and in 1982&#150;3, at the request of the prime minister, into the government's handling of the Falklands conflict. In between, he kept his hand in with a number of smaller, solo productions on the development of India and Pakistan (1960), British business schools (1963), the Committee of London Clearing Bankers (1974), and a register of immigrants' dependants (1976). In 1975 he was briefly but happily reunited with Radcliffe on the publication of ministerial memoirs.<br>
<br>Franks did not write these Franks reports, yet he was their author. They excelled in exposition. They exhibited a drive for clarity, rationality, efficiency. The reforms they invariably advocated were enlightened, ameliorative, improving in the sense that Gladstone understood. Franks's affinity for the fundamental meant that little was overlooked. Often he confronted taboos of various kinds: national sovereignty, official secrecy, college autonomy. Reasoned discussion of the taboo is already an enlightened step. The radical undertow of the reports is easy to miss. With the exception of official secrets legislation, moreover, Franks left nothing as he found it. Perceptions changed even when institutional practice did not.<br>
<br>Franks had as much influence on people as on events. He was a natural exemplar. Clement Attlee's unreserved judgement was a representative one: for the majority of those who encountered him, Franks was the ablest man they ever met. There was a period, extending from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, when it seemed to his contemporaries that he could do almost anything&#151;chancellor of the exchequer or governor of the Bank of England, as Rab Butler put it. But these were paths not taken. Franks forswore further influence on policy making. After Lloyds he retreated once more to his beloved Oxford, becoming provost of Worcester College (1962&#150;76) and Lockean under-labourer in the college garden. In the end he offered no lessons to others except that of a life well led. He died at his home, Blackhall Farm, Garford Road, Oxford, on 15 October 1992. A memorial service was held at the university church of St Mary the Virgin, on 13 December. He was survived by his two daughters, Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1939) and Alison (<i>b</i>. 1945).<br>
<br>&#145;He was a man of the greatest reticence, but with nothing to conceal; a man of intensely &#147;private life&#148;, but wholly transparent&#146;: Franks attained what T. S. Eliot self-referentially admired in Spinoza. The hallmark of his intensely private life was his simplicity&#151;a Quaker tenet. &#145;We nearly all of us have something of the sailor or gardener in us&#146;, he told the Pilgrim Society in 1948  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Oliver Franks</span>, 196). John Locke presented his patron, Lord Shaftesbury, with a delightful little volume of his own composition, <span class="italic">The Growth of Vines and Olives</span>. Perhaps if things had fallen out differently Franks might have done likewise for his patron, Bevin. In every sense, he stood squarely in the tradition of looking after the garden he inherited. It is sometimes said that he was not creative. In diplomacy he was highly creative. Complex international negotiation suited Franks's temperament. Always deliberate, he could be deliberately cautious or deliberately adventurous as the need arose. Caution was what Franks sufficiently possessed to be able (judiciously) to throw it to the winds. It is true that the Marshall plan and the Atlantic pact were &#145;given&#146; to him, but these were flying saucers&#151;grand ideas as yet unformed. Franks supplied the <i>phronesis</i>, the practical wisdom, to make them real. It was as if Marshall and Bevin sat, massively, on the bough of history while Franks worked the wood. He was not alone in this endeavour, but his coadjutors were few. Franks was one of the founders of the post-war world.<br>
