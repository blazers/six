<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gallie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Humphreys]</span>,  Menna Patricia</span>  (1919&#150;1990), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Dolycoed, Station Road, in the Welsh mining community of Ystradgynlais, Brecknockshire, on 18 March 1919 (though she celebrated her birthday on 17 March, and her year of birth has commonly been given as 1920), the youngest of the three daughters of Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rhys Williams (<i>b</i>. 1883), and her husband, William Thomas Humphreys, a carpenter and for a time a colliery engine fitter. She came from a close-knit, chapel-going, Welsh-speaking family where &#145;Aunts stood around us like the Druid stones&#146;  (videotape, 1985, South Wales Miners' Library, Swansea University). She claimed that she was eight before she learned any English and that her monoglot maternal grandmother knew just two English sentences: &#145;I like ice cream&#146; and &#145;Keir Hardie called me Comrade&#146;  (interview, 1984). Her maternal grandfather, Rees Rhys Williams, a collier and farmer, had helped to found the Labour Representation Committee in South Wales. She was proud of her socialist heritage: &#145;There was no question of one's politics. No other way of thinking&#151;you were a socialist&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>When Menna was seven the local community became engulfed in the general strike and its aftermath. This affected her deeply and later became the subject of her first novel, <span class="italic">Strike for a Kingdom</span> (1959). As she admitted, her account of the village she called Cilhendre was partly autobiographical. This was a historical novel, a detective story, and an evocation of the rural-cum-industrial nature of the colliery communities of south Wales, as well as both a tragedy and a wickedly humorous tale. It calls for justice for a murder that reveals blighted lives and it demands justice for the miners. At its centre is a brilliant portrayal of a gentle miner-poet forced to re-evaluate his very title as a justice of the peace but a true dispenser of justice. Such figures were once a force in Welsh mining communities. Her central character was based on her uncle, William Rhys Williams (known as W. R.), a collier from the age of thirteen who attended Ruskin College, Oxford. Active in the South Wales Miners' Federation, he was also a magistrate, Independent Labour Party chairman, Labour county councillor, and poet.<br>
<br>The Humphreys family moved to neighbouring Creunant in the Dulais valley when Menna was ten. She flourished at Neath Grammar School for Girls and went on to University College, Swansea, where she gained a degree in English. On 13 July 1940, a month after finishing her final degree examinations, she married a philosophy lecturer, <a href="#cosubject_70900">(Walter) Bryce Gallie [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Five days later he left for the army.<br>
<br>After war work for the Inland Revenue in Llandudno and London, Menna Gallie spent the rest of the 1940s back in Ystradgynlais. Here were born her two children, Charles and Edyth. The Polish-born artist Josef Herman was also living in the village. He became a friend and Gallie modelled for him. During the early 1950s, when W. B. Gallie had a chair at the University College of North Staffordshire, the family lived in the midlands. The second of Menna Gallie's six published novels, <span class="italic">Man's Desiring</span> (1960), was loosely based on this experience and sought, less successfully than her first book, to explore another kind of community life as well as class and cultural differences between south Wales and England. She returned to the subject matter she knew best in her third novel (her personal favourite). The <span class="italic">The Small Mine</span> (1962) portrays Cilhendre in the late 1940s. Its straightforward title stands out from her other book titles with their puns and literary allusions. With first-hand knowledge of the Swansea, Neath, and Dulais valleys and attention to men and women in the community, it is a valuable corrective to the dominant fictional representation of Welsh colliery society by male writers emphasizing the industrial and heavily populated Rhondda valleys further east and heroic, militant miners.<br>
<br>Gallie wrote these three novels in co. Down, Northern Ireland, where the family lived in a house on the grand Castle Ward estate within sight of Strangford Lough. Her husband held a chair at Belfast, while she taught part-time at Orangefield Boys' Secondary School in Belfast, did voluntary work in Downpatrick, and guided visitors around the stately home of her neighbour the duchess of Bangor. She also typed up her husband's lecture notes. As her children grew older she gained more time to write. A consummate raconteur, Gallie appreciated the art of story-telling in Ireland. Alert to the similarities between Welsh and Irish place names and traditions, she found that the combination of place and space&#151;Celtic familiarity coupled with physical distance from Wales&#151;and the richness of linguistic expression freed her to become a writer. Yet she was aware of the irony: &#145;What I owe to Ulster is of course the peace I've found in this so-called violent country&#146;  (Menna Gallie papers, L1/9).<br>
<br>Yet, like many aspiring women novelists, Menna Gallie initially lacked confidence in her ability to write books. <span class="italic">Strike for a Kingdom</span> was written in just three months but languished in a drawer for a year before Bryce Gallie persuaded her to send it to a publisher. Victor Gollancz accepted it and then published four more of her novels. Harper and Row became her American publisher. <span class="italic">Strike</span> was extensively reviewed on both sides of the Atlantic, translated into Japanese, and praised by Eleanor Roosevelt. The <span class="italic">Herald Tribune</span> described Gallie as &#145;A born writer, indeed almost a poet&#146; who &#145;seems to breathe her story, rather than manipulate it&#146;  (Menna Gallie papers, L4/1). Although her most enthusiastic following was in America (comparisons with Dylan Thomas, whom she knew, probably enhancing her reputation there), <span class="italic">Strike</span> received positive reviews across the UK and was a runner-up for the Crime Writers' Association of Great Britain's prestigious gold dagger award.<br>
<br>Gallie made broadcasts for the Northern Ireland Home Service and was active in PEN (Poets, Essayists, and Novelists), representing Northern Ireland at a PEN conference in Yugoslavia. In 1968 <span class="italic">Travels with a Duchess</span> appeared, a story of two women shedding inhibitions and indulging in holiday &#145;flings&#146; in Dubrovnik. Her protagonists are middle-aged&#151;Gallie delighted in shocking and ridiculing convention. She also exposed such indignities as the obstacles facing married women on joint passports who chose to travel alone and so anticipated issues about to exercise the modern women's movement. She remained, however, wary of the feminist label even though her years in Cambridge (where this book was written) helped to make her in practice, if not name, a defender of women's rights.<br>
<br>Menna Gallie had relished her years in Northern Ireland. She was less enthusiastic about the period from 1967 to 1978 in Cambridge, which was her one place of residence that did not become the backdrop for a novel. Admittedly the heroine of Gallie's next novel was a middle-aged Welsh widow and civil servant based in Cambridge, but she was seeking solace in Northern Ireland. <span class="italic">You're Welcome to Ulster</span> (1970), with its explicit account of Sarah Thomas rekindling a relationship with a married man, reflected the sexual liberation of its time. It also heralded an approach that would become a trademark of the 1970s by bringing together the personal and the political. This was one of the first novels about the modern &#145;troubles&#146; in Northern Ireland. Set where Gallie had lived, the action takes place in July 1969, culminating in the events of the twelfth. A blend of fact and fiction&#151;prefaced by an extract from the <span class="roman">Special Powers Act</span> of 1922&#151;it deplores violence and bigotry of any kind and affirms her commitment to constitutional socialism. For thirteen years she had been active in the non-sectarian Northern Ireland Labour Party. Written when the investiture of the prince of Wales was causing some unrest within Wales, <span class="italic">You're Welcome</span> also addresses her concern about extreme forms of Welsh nationalist politics.<br>
<br>The Gallies spent their last years in Newport, Pembrokeshire, in a house in Upper St Mary Street which they named Cilhendre. They entertained&#151;with customary verve&#151;a wide circle of friends. Menna Gallie had already produced a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Little England's Other Half</span> (1974), about local customs, and translated Caradog Prichard's Welsh novel <span class="italic">Un nos ola leuad</span> under the title <span class="italic">Full Moon</span> (1973). Her last book, <span class="italic">In these Promiscuous Parts</span> (1986), was published only in America (by St Martin's Press). Previous novels had been written retrospectively after leaving a locale. In contrast this was set in the rural community where she was now playing an active role. It lacked the punch of Gallie's earlier Welsh fiction, perhaps partly because she remained so close to her subject matter. She had written her earlier novels (not all of which were published) at speed. This book took shape slowly and with difficulty, exacerbated by her arthritis.<br>
<br>Menna Gallie died of a stroke at home in Newport on 17 June 1990. She was cremated at Narberth on 22 June. Her reputation waned after her death but her writing has recently been re-evaluated. Now she is becoming recognized as one of the leading Anglo-Welsh women novelists of the second half of the twentieth century. Four of her novels were in print twenty years after her death.<br>
<br>Menna Gallie was survived by her husband, <a name="cosubject_70900"></a><span class="headword">(Walter) Bryce Gallie</span>  (1912&#150;1998), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, who was born at Fernville, Lenzie, Dunbartonshire, on 5 October 1912, the third son of Walter Smith Gallie (<i>d</i>. 1944), structural engineer, and his wife, (Martha) Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wormald (<i>d</i>. 1939). After Sedbergh School, which was later the subject of his first book, <span class="italic">An English School</span> (1949), he entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1931, graduated with a first in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1934, and took the research degree of BLitt in 1937. He was a lecturer in philosophy at University College, Swansea, from 1935 to 1950, his tenure interrupted by war service between 1940 and 1945. At Balliol he had been a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the master, A. D. Lindsay, who in 1950 appointed him the first professor of philosophy at the University College of North Staffordshire (later Keele University, of which Lindsay became vice-chancellor). There he wrote about the American logician C. S. Peirce: <span class="italic">Peirce and Pragmatism</span> (1952). After Lindsay's death he published <span class="italic">A New University: A. D. Lindsay and the Keele Experiment</span> (1960). In 1954 he became professor of logic and metaphysics at Queen's College, Belfast. His most important work emanated from Belfast, where he developed his ideas about &#145;essentially contested concepts&#146; (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</span>, 1956) and published <span class="italic">Philosophy and the Historical Understanding</span> (1964). From 1967 until his retirement in 1978 he was professor of political science at Cambridge University, and a fellow of Peterhouse. He died in Cardigan on 31 August 1998. His last books, <span class="italic">Philosophers of Peace and War</span> (1978) and <span class="italic">Understanding War</span> (1990), reflected his and Menna Gallie's interest in peace, one of many concerns that this creative couple shared.<br>
