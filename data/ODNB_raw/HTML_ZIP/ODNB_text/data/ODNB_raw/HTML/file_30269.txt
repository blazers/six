<span class="headword">Young,  John</span>  (1746/7&#150;1820), <span class="occ">university teacher</span>, was born in Glasgow, the second son of John Young, a cooper in the city. He matriculated from Glasgow University in 1764 and proceeded MA in 1769. He was installed professor of Greek at the university on 9 June 1774 and was noted as a popular teacher with a good sense of humour, and one who deeply enjoyed the Greek language and oratory. He published sparingly but was passionately interested in classical theatre, and greatly admired the acting of Edmund Kean. He was nicknamed Cocky Bung by the students on account of his father's occupation. He married, on 25 September 1780, Jean, daughter of Colin Lamont of Knockdow, in Argyll; they had seven children. His eldest son, John (1781&#150;1852), was for a time chaplain to the East India Company and died rector of Newdigate, Surrey; his fourth son, Charles (1796&#150;1822), was a promising classical scholar who died in Glasgow on 17 December 1822.<br>
<br>As a professor Young attempted to extend the rights of professors while at the same time guarding his own. About the time of his election he argued with another professor over the house that could have come with his post, but in 1781 he gained accommodation when he was made curator of the college chambers. He objected to moves that would have spared students taking the obligatory examination in Greek before studying logic, as this would have diminished his own income, but he was one of the group of professors who sought to apply to parliament to allow them the right of electing the rector. On the whole he was fairly resistant to change, and maintained his chair even in old age, when he became feebler. He died, aged seventy-three, on 18 November 1820 at The George inn, Glasgow, while taking a bath. He was buried in Glasgow Cathedral.<br>
