<span class="headword">Nisbet,  Murdoch</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1531&#150;<em>c.</em>1559), <span class="occ">biblical translator</span>, was a notary public in the diocese of Glasgow. A resident of Hardhill in the parish of Loudoun, Ayrshire, Nisbet's notarial work associated him with known religious dissidents in the area around Kyle and Cunninghame, and particularly with the Campbells of Cessnock and Lockharts of Bar. He took part in <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading in a conventicle, an activity which was prosecuted elsewhere in the diocese as early as 1531. The group read from a manuscript <span class="roman">New Testament</span> translated by Nisbet into Scots from the revised version of the Lollard <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Nisbet's manuscript <span class="roman">New Testament</span> survived for some time as a family heirloom, but it was eventually sold and is now in the British Library (Egerton MS 2880). Although the manuscript does not bear Nisbet's name, it does bear an embellishment on several verso leaves which resembles Nisbet's notarial instrument; this, in addition to his family's ownership of the text, suggests that he was in fact the copyist. The biblical text, along with some of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> epistles, was copied with slightly elaborated initials in red and green, and such other features as running book and chapter headings.<br>
<br>The date of transcription is impossible to determine; a later family memoir claims that Nisbet had to flee abroad some time during the reign of James V because of his beliefs, during which time he &#145;took a Copy of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Writ&#146;  (Nisbet, 3). At a later date, the manuscript was augmented with additions drawn from Miles Coverdale's <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, published by James Nycolson at Southwark in late 1537 or early 1538 (<span class="italic">STC</span> 2838). These include a preface to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, Tyndale's revised preface to <span class="roman">Romans</span>, book summaries divided by chapter, marginal glosses and cross-references, and liturgical reading markers; all of them, like the text, were transcribed into Scots. A few changes to the text were also made, most significantly the altering of &#145;sacrament&#146; to &#145;secret&#146; in nine places. This second stage of textual composition was produced with a less careful, perhaps more rushed hand than that of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> text, though it is possible that it was still Nisbet's work. The additional material presents throughout a developed solafideist theology, with occasional anti-papal or anti-monastic glosses. In the preface to <span class="roman">Romans</span>, Tyndale's later position on law and gospel is set out along with much basic Lutheran theological material.<br>
<br>The only significant alteration made by the copyist in this second stage was the omission of a gloss on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 5: 34 which mitigated Christ's prohibition on swearing, which suggests that although Nisbet's circle readily accepted much of protestant theology it was unwilling to depart from its typically Lollard aversion to swearing. That this should be so after 1538 shows that Lollardy had a lasting, if limited, influence in the south-west of Scotland. The family memoir reports that in 1539 Nisbet &#145;digged and built a Vault in the Bottom of his own House&#146; to avoid detection of his conventicle's <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading; he emerged during the regency of Mary of Guise, that is, some time between 1554 and 1559, to take part in iconoclastic activity &#145;tho' then an old Man&#146;  (Nisbet, 3). The date of his death is not recorded. Knox and his historiographical successors do not mention Nisbet, but this may reflect the limitations of their researches rather than the true extent of his importance. Among Nisbet's descendants was a martyr of the covenanter cause, John Nisbet, who was executed in 1685.<br>
