<span class="headword">Thomson,  David</span>  (1912&#150;1970), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 13 January 1912, the only son and elder child of Robert Thomson, printer, and his wife, Isabella Barr. Educated at Sir George Monoux Grammar School, Walthamstow, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, he remained in the college for the rest of his life. He was research fellow (1938&#150;45), teaching fellow (1945&#150;57), and master (1957&#150;70).<br>
<br>Having obtained first-class honours with distinction in both parts of the historical tripos in 1933 and 1934, Thomson did research under Sir Ernest Barker on attitudes to political parties in eighteenth-century Britain, winning the Gladstone memorial prize in 1937 and receiving his PhD in 1938. By then he was already working on recent French history; he had begun his lifelong association with the Workers' Educational Association as lecturer and committee man; and he could write in 1942 (in a letter to Kingsley Martin, Thomson papers), that he had &#145;several years of free-lance journalism&#146; behind him. During the Second World War he was much in demand from the BBC and the Ministry of Information for lectures and pamphlets, some of them explicitly countering Nazi propaganda. He became involved in organizations such as the London Institute of World Affairs which were promoting serious debate about the war, the future peace, and reconstruction. As an expert on France he had some awkward dealings with the Free French in London. From this time date his small book <span class="italic">The Democratic Ideal in France and England</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">Patterns of Peacemaking</span> (1945), written with E. Meyer and Asa Briggs.<br>
<br>After the war Thomson became a much appreciated lecturer in Cambridge (university lecturer, 1948&#150;68; reader in modern French history, 1968&#150;70). It was no doubt mainly because the focus of his interests had shifted that he did not pursue earlier plans to publish his important PhD thesis. But he was conscious that its subject matter and argument were deeply suspect to the school of eighteenth-century historians who followed Sir Lewis Namier and were believed to exercise a virtual veto on academic publication in their period. The broader standpoint of his own teaching and lecturing on modern British history had a significant impact on his pupils and was conveyed to a wider audience in his two volumes in the <span class="roman">Pelican History of England</span>, <span class="italic">England in the Nineteenth Century</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">England in the Twentieth Century</span> (1965). But his most notable influence as a teacher in Cambridge was exercised through his lectures on French history and especially those on theories of the modern state, in which he not only gave an account of the work of major thinkers but also brought out the interaction between ideology and political developments in nineteenth- and twentieth-century history.<br>
<br>Thomson's writing on France was crowned by his seminal <span class="italic">Democracy in France</span> (1946), which emphasized the underlying continuity and stability of the Third Republic despite its frequent changes of ministry. He was fascinated by the character and political career of de Gaulle, about whom he wrote in many newspaper articles and (with Laval) in <span class="italic">Two Frenchmen</span> (1951); and in the early sixties the Foreign Office commissioned from him a report on Gaullism. Of his other writings his substantial <span class="italic">Europe since Napoleon</span> (1957) has held its place for half a century as one of the best general surveys of its field. He also wrote a <span class="italic">World History from 1914 to 1968</span> (1969; 1st edn to 1950, 1964) and edited the controversial volume 12 of the <span class="italic">New Cambridge Modern History</span>. He held that the study of history is &#145;the best liberal education a student can have in the modern world&#146; and defended the writing of contemporary history against those who maintained that the historian could form worthwhile judgements only about distant periods. He believed that dons should seek to enlighten the public and the government, and that governments should draw on the knowledge and wisdom of dons. In his last book, <span class="italic">The Aims of History</span> (1969), he described himself when he wrote of the historical &#145;general practitioner&#146; who is &#145;a craftsman of synthesis rather than of analysis, a weaver of other men's threads (and some of his own) into patterns which they had not foreseen or even expected&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomson was active in Cambridge University affairs: member of the council of the senate from 1950 to 1958, chairman of the faculty board of history from 1958 to 1960, from 1962 to his death chairman of the governors of the Institute of Education; and then the first chairman of the colleges' committee set up after the report in 1962 on the relationship between the colleges and the university, chaired by Lord Bridges. Meanwhile, he was one of the first history dons to become a regular visitor to the United States: he was visiting professor of public law and government at Columbia University, New York, in 1950 and 1953. In his Hoernl&eacute; memorial lecture at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1958, &#145;The government of divided communities&#146;, he tackled a dangerously topical issue. He continued to write for the national press, especially <span class="italic">The Times</span>, to which he contributed some anonymous leaders, many signed articles on France, and numerous letters.<br>
<br>Deeply attached to his college, Thomson was a dedicated and much loved teacher and (from 1946 to 1953) a benevolent and conscientious senior tutor. He worked to maintain academic standards and took pride in the fact that Sidney Sussex admitted relatively more students from grammar schools than most colleges did at that period: among those for whose admission his intervention was directly responsible was Royston Lambert. As master his contribution was distinctive. Neither of his two predecessors had been productive scholars or in the public eye, and the lodge had seen little hospitality. It now became a family place where he and his wife, Margaret Gordon, daughter of James Dallas, schoolmaster, whom he had married in 1943, lived with their two schoolboy sons, entertaining with great warmth and without the least sign of pomposity. He brimmed over with amusing anecdotes and his large frame frequently shook with laughter. In his day the lodge was visited by such notables as Adlai Stevenson, Pierre Mend&egrave;s-France, and Hubert Humphrey; research seminars took place in it; and yet the master was always accessible to undergraduates and old members of the college, particularly his ex-pupils. During his mastership the number of fellows almost doubled and the first post-war block of undergraduate accommodation was built.<br>
<br>Thomson's historical breadth and the range of his other activities were made possible only by exceptional energy and application, a calm and cheerful temperament, and extraordinary powers of concentration. Visitors noticed that, after a chat in which he had seemed to have all the time in the world, he would be back at his typewriter before they were out of earshot.<br>
<br>Amid all his other activities Thomson was first and foremost a don and an educationist. He was a strong believer in the species of grammar school which he himself had attended. He thoroughly enjoyed his duties as chairman of the governors of the Perse School, which included planning its move from central Cambridge. He was in many ways an innovator, helping to pioneer educational films and the BBC's schools history programmes and joining in an unsuccessful campaign in Cambridge to establish a centre of advanced study. But he was suspicious of the proposals for large-scale university expansion made in the report of the committee on higher education (1961&#150;4) chaired by Lord Robbins. By the end of the sixties he was seen by radicals as a reactionary, and undergraduate militancy was making residence in the middle of a college less agreeable&#151;a particularly unkind reward to this most approachable of dons.<br>
<br>In 1968 Thomson was found to have lung cancer, from which he died, in Cambridge, on 24 February 1970. He was cremated at Cambridge crematorium.<br>
