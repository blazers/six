<span class="headword">Milton <span class="st"> [Meliton, Middleton, Mildditone, Militon]</span>,  William  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1257<span class="mult">x</span>60), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and theologian</span>, is listed as &#145;Fr. W. de Milton&#146;, the fifth Franciscan &#145;master&#146; at Cambridge, on a leaf inserted in the oldest manuscript of the chronicle by the author known as Thomas of Eccleston. Historians have identified him with a William de Middletoun (or Melitona, and so on) who was a Franciscan regent master at Paris, and whom Pope Alexander IV put in charge of the task of completing the <span class="italic">Summa</span> associated with Alexander of Hales (<i>d</i>. 1245). If so, Milton was a major intellectual figure among the early Cambridge men (not a great distinction, it is true). The identification is not certain. The dates given by Moorman for the Cambridge master are hardly to be reconciled with what is known of the Paris master. But if his unreliable chronology is abandoned, it is possible to avoid multiplying Franciscan Master W.s beyond necessity.<br>
<br>Even the most scanty and tentative reconstruction of Milton's curriculum vitae is beset with difficulties. He seems to have been a regent master in theology at Paris in 1248, and may have kept that position until as late as 1253. He would have been a master at Cambridge for a period in the mid-1250s. According to Doucet it was in 1255 that Alexander IV made him head of a commission to finish the <span class="italic">Summa Fratris Alexandri</span>, by the bull <span class="italic">De fontibus paradisi</span>. This appears correct&#151;Doucet cites his source. An alternative version, that the bull was issued in 1256, seems to be a misunderstanding. A. G. Little's statement, that Milton was appointed by Innocent IV in 1252 to finish the <span class="italic">Summa</span>, may have derived from the <span class="italic">Histoire litt&eacute;raire de la France</span>, which in turn seems to be following the early modern scholar J. A. Fabricius, who gives no medieval source. Consequently this dating to 1252 should probably be disregarded. There is also a problem about the date of Milton's death. Callebaut (followed by Smalley) argues that he died in 1257. Doucet leaves open the possibility that Milton died as late as 1260. He was one of the Franciscans who helped Isabelle, sister of Louis IX of France, with her rule for her nunnery at Longchamp; but if the 1257 date is right, Milton did not live to see the end of these preparations.<br>
<br>A range of commentaries or postills on books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> have been attributed to Milton, but it is at present impossible to be certain of his authorship of all of these. The <span class="roman">Apocalypse</span> commentary has been studied by Burr, and there seems no reason to doubt Milton's authorship. In a Paris university stationer's <i>pecia</i> list of 1275 Guillermus de Mildditone appears as author of commentaries on <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, the twelve prophets, <span class="roman">St Mark's gospel</span>, <span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span>, and <span class="roman">Job</span>. The commentary on the twelve lesser prophets, whose authenticity is assured, and which was popular in Milton's lifetime and/or within a few decades of his death, gives an idea of what his biblical lecturing was like. It shows originality of a kind in returning to Benedictine spirituality by drawing on a work written in the early twelfth century by Guibert de Nogent. Apart from biblical commentaries, his authorship of <span class="italic">Quaestiones de sacramentis</span> and <span class="italic">Quaestiones disputatae xxiv</span> seems accepted, but not of the twelve <i>quaestiones disputatae</i> in MS Padua, Biblioteca Antoniana MS 152, which were once attributed to him.<br>
<br>The history of Milton's <span class="italic">Quaestiones de sacramentis</span>, as reconstructed by Doucet, is a good example of how thirteenth-century Franciscan scholars worked. Milton drew heavily on the <i>quaestiones</i> of Alexander of Hales, but Milton's <i>quaestiones</i> were in turn incorporated to a great extent word for word into the fourth part of the <span class="italic">Summa</span> &#145;of brother Alexander&#146;, probably when Milton was working to complete it. Milton and his collaborators apparently made additions to the earlier parts of the synthesis too, but the task was not completed when Milton died, after which the commission under his charge seems to have given up the task. Doucet is probably right to think that Milton had been working on Alexander's unfinished <i>opus</i> even before the papacy came to his aid by asking the order to find him collaborators. William of Milton seems to have played a tenacious if unostentatious part in the formation of the powerful Franciscan intellectual tradition.<br>
