<span class="headword">Bullen,  Frank Thomas</span>  (1857&#150;1915), <span class="occ">merchant seaman and writer</span>, was born at 40 Alfred Road, Paddington, London, on 5 April 1857, the son of Frank Robert Bullen, journeyman stonemason of Crewkerne, Dorset, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown. When he was eighteen months old the family broke up, his upbringing passing to a maiden aunt. An elder sister disappeared, and he saw his mother only once again, though he re-established contact with his father later in life. Existence depended on his aunt's ability at home sewing, yet two foundations of his later development were laid down: an awareness of literature and familiarity with religion. A natural pre-school reader, he attended dame- and junior schools and a Sunday school chapel in Paddington, but was otherwise cloistered until, in 1866, aged nine, he was thrown out on the streets following his aunt's death. Thereafter he was self-educated.<br>
<br>In and out of errand-boy jobs, Bullen now lodged for the cost of his keep or, between jobs, slept rough and lived on scraps. Thus he learned a &#145;street wisdom&#146; which helped him through similar periods between passages at sea. In January 1869, when not yet twelve, he persuaded an uncle, a ship's master, to take him as cabin-boy. So began the most influential phase of his life, largely in the lower strata of British merchant shipping. By the age of thirteen he had twice been shipwrecked and had survived two epidemics of yellow fever, a hurricane, and two serious illnesses. Most of his sea service was in sail. He served in over twenty-five ships, rising to able seaman and, after passing the examinations for second mate and first mate, in those capacities when such employment offered.<br>
<br>On 1 September 1879 Bullen married Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1945), daughter of Voltaire Lucifer Grimwood, shoemaker. They had two sons, both of whom died young, and three daughters. The couple separated about 1905. In 1882 he became a clerk in the Meteorological Office, augmenting his income by running simultaneously a picture-framing business and haberdashery shop in London. This led to a collapse from overwork and, in the mid-1890s, to voluntary bankruptcy. Although he disliked clerical employment, his writing ability and theoretical understanding of marine science were developing. Following a conversion at sea he became an evangelical Christian, and through spare-time preaching he developed an ability at public speaking.<br>
<br>The acceptance of Bullen's first article about 1894 led to regular contributions to popular journals, including <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, with syndication in American journals. Appointed columnist on the <span class="italic">Morning Leader</span>, and financially stable, he left the Meteorological Office in 1899 and also began accepting engagements as a paid circuit lecturer. His illustrated lectures commanded large audiences. Later he undertook lecture tours in Australia, New Zealand, and North America. His first of thirty-six books, and most widely acclaimed, <span class="italic">The Cruise of the &#145;Cachalot&#146;</span> (1898), established his international reputation.<br>
<br>All Bullen's writing and lectures derived from his sea experience, keen observation, and a good memory, and were concerned mainly with marine science and sea life. His easy, natural style made his non-fictional writing compulsive reading and he did much to explain the maritime world to the public ashore. Maritime historians rate his revelations of seafaring conditions in the 1870s highly, though his fictional work was not of the same calibre. Born the same year as Joseph Conrad, his reputation became established earlier, though his work did not retain the same general literary esteem.<br>
<br>Bullen was awarded a civil-list pension in 1912. He died on 26 February 1915 at Reid's Palace Hotel in Funchal during a visit to Madeira and was buried there on the 27th in the English cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
