<span class="headword">Wright, Sir  (William) Charles</span>, second baronet  (1876&#150;1950), <span class="occ">ironmaster and steelmaker</span>, was born at Legge Lane, Lady Wood, Birmingham, on 13 January 1876, the only son of Sir John Roper Wright (1843&#150;1926), engineer and first baronet, and his first wife, Jane Eliza, daughter of Charles Wilson, a master mechanical engineer of Birmingham. Wright was educated privately and had begun to study for his army entrance examination when, in 1893, he decided to join his father in the steelmaking business of Wright, Butler &amp; Co. Ltd. He at once applied himself zealously to learning the business, passing through all the production departments of the company's works in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. During this time, in 1898, he married Maud, the daughter of Isaac Butler, one of his father's business associates and JP, of Pant-teg, Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>In 1902 Wright, Butler &amp; Co. Ltd merged with companies controlled by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40801/', "Alfred Baldwin (1841&#150;1908)")</script> to form Baldwins Ltd. By 1903 Wright had become a director of Baldwins, and following the acquisition of the mothballed Port Talbot steelworks in 1906, he became manager of the Port Talbot Steel Company Ltd, where production of steel commenced in January 1907. When Alfred Baldwin died in 1908, Wright's father moved up from managing director to chairman of Baldwins, and Wright took over as managing director. This elevation within the company, and the increased responsibilities he acquired, pushed him into the forefront of the iron and steel industry and the public life of south Wales. He became a JP for Glamorgan and, in 1912, high sheriff of the county.<br>
<br>Wright also maintained links with the army. In 1900 he had become an honorary captain and, in 1907, lieutenant-colonel commanding the Glamorgan Royal Field (Reserve) Artillery. In 1909 he became honorary colonel and joined the general reserve of officers, continuing in this position until 1931. Despite his military connections, Wright's major contribution during the First World War was not on active duty in the front line, but helping to control iron and steel production. On 22 June 1915 he was appointed to the Ministry of Munitions to supervise the supply and distribution of steel, but he left on 16 February 1916 to undertake military duties, among which was a special mission to Italy in connection with the supply of sheet steel for the Italian army. On 2 January 1917 he returned to the ministry as deputy director and subsequently became controller of iron and steel production on 20 August 1917. For his services during the First World War he was appointed CB in 1918 and KBE in 1920; he was also made an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (France) and a knight commander of the order of the Crown of Italy.<br>
<br>In 1925 Wright succeeded his father as chairman of Baldwins Ltd, and was at the forefront of the rationalization process in south Wales. Most notable was the merger of the heavy steel interests of Baldwins and Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds Ltd in 1930. Wright became chairman and managing director of the new company, the British (Guest Keen Baldwins) Iron and Steel Company Ltd (GKB). His prominent position within the steel industry was reflected in his election as president of the Iron and Steel Institute (1931&#150;3) and as president of the British Iron and Steel Federation (1937&#150;8). He joined the iron and steel control, Ministry of Supply, on its formation in 1939, as deputy controller, and succeeded Sir Andrew Duncan as controller in January 1940. He resigned on account of illness towards the end of 1942, but resumed the post for a few months in 1943, when his successor was likewise indisposed. For his services he was promoted GBE in 1943.<br>
<br>At the end of that same year Wright resigned as managing director of GKB, subsequently resigning as company chairman in 1947. In part linked to his age and state of health, these decisions were also a consequence of further reorganization of the iron and steel industry in south Wales. As one of the architects of these and earlier changes Wright felt it was time to leave subsequent developments in the hands of younger men. He had played his part in the merger between Baldwins and Richard Thomas &amp; Co. Ltd in 1944&#150;5, to form Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd (RTB), and that, on 1 May 1947, between GKB, John Lysaght, RTB, and Llanelly Associated Tinplate Companies, to form the Steel Company of Wales Ltd. Wright ultimately severed his links with the industry on 31 March 1949, resigning as a director of GKB some seventeen months before his death, at his home, Englemere Hill, Ascot, Berkshire, on 14 August 1950 from cancer. Without issue, the baronetcy to which he had succeeded in 1926, on the death of his father, became extinct.<br>
<br>A tall man with a fine presence, Wright displayed generosity, kindness, and consideration for others; but he was a hard worker and a born leader who expected, and obtained, co-operation from others. A man of action, to whom order and method came naturally, when there was work to be done he tackled it eagerly and gave quick decisions with a sure touch. While his father was acknowledged as an engineer, and is noted for his association with William Siemens in the development of the open-hearth process of steelmaking at the Landore works in south Wales, Wright is best remembered as an organizer. Although he made frequent overseas trips to keep abreast of modern technological developments, his strength was in establishing strong managerial teams, and fostering cordial relationships with key customers and politicians.<br>
