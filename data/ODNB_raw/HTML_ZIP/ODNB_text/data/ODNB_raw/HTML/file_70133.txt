<span class="headword">Tomson,  Giles</span>  (1553&#150;1612), <span class="occ">bishop of Gloucester</span>, was born in London, the son of Giles Tomson, a grocer. He attended Merchant Taylors' School from 1564, and went up in 1571, as an exhibitioner, to University College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1575 and proceeded MA in 1578; he was incorporated at Cambridge the same year. He became a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, in 1580, served as university proctor in 1586, and received his BD in 1590. At Elizabeth I's visit to Oxford in 1592 he distinguished himself by determining the natural philosophy disputation with &#145;a very learned and discreet speach&#146;  (Nichols), which from the queen's viewpoint probably also had the great merit of brevity. In the same year Tomson acquired the living of Pembridge in Herefordshire, and in 1594 a canonry in Hereford Cathedral from Bishop Westfaling. It appears that he never married. Some time in the late 1590s he became chaplain to Queen Elizabeth, preaching before her in the Lenten sermons of 1598 and 1599. He received his DD in 1602 and the plum deanery of Windsor in February 1603. Over the next nine years he often presided at chapter meetings at Windsor where he handled estate business and administered discipline to errant clerks and poor knights, one of whom accused him in 1608 of oppressive government. He remained a royal chaplain on the accession of James I.<br>
<br>In January 1604 Tomson attended the Hampton Court conference, though there is no record of his contribution. At the meeting it was agreed that a new translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> be prepared and Tomson was appointed to a team of eight Oxford theologians helping with the Greek versions of the gospels, <span class="roman">Acts</span>, and <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. Tomson was a &#145;good friend&#146; of the poet John Davies, who praised his lively conversation and claimed that in Tomson's face &#145;witt, and pietie doth shine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Microcosmos</span>, 1603, sig. Nn2i<i>r</i>); John Manningham attended a court sermon that Tomson preached in April 1603, noting that he used &#145;a sounding laboured artificiall prounciacion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>) as Tomson, it seems, commented tartly on the scramble for position with the imminent arrival of the new king.<br>
<br>Tomson continued to preach at the Jacobean court and, though his patrons remain obscure, in 1611 he earned the bishopric of Gloucester. He was consecrated on 9 June at Lambeth, having received permission to retain the deanery of Windsor for a year after his consecration; he died at Windsor Castle almost to the day, on 14 June 1612, not yet having visited his diocese. He was buried in Bray chapel at St George's Chapel, Windsor, with a monument depicting him, half-length, in the pulpit.<br>
