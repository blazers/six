<span class="headword">Courtney,  William Leonard</span>  (1850&#150;1928), <span class="occ">philosopher and journalist</span>, was born at Poona, India, on 5 January 1850, the youngest in the family of three sons and three daughters of William Courtney, of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Ann Edwardes, daughter of Captain Edward Scott RN, of Hoegarden House, Plymouth; his early years were profoundly influenced by his eldest sister, Emily (Minnie), a remarkable woman. Educated at Somerset College, Bath, under the Revd Hay Sweet Escott, a stimulating teacher, he was elected scholar of University College, Oxford, the vigorous life of which he enjoyed from 1868 to 1872. After gaining first classes in classical moderations (1870) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1872), he won a fellowship at Merton College in the latter year, and shared the society of Mandell Creighton, William Wallace, R. J. Wilson, Andrew Lang, and F. H. Bradley among the fellows. In 1873 Courtney was appointed headmaster of his old school, Somerset College, and in the following year married Cordelia Blanche, daughter of Commander Lionel Place, RN, with whom he had three daughters and four sons, the youngest of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30975/', "Air Marshal Sir Christopher Courtney (1890&#150;1976)")</script>.<br>
<br>Courtney returned to Oxford in 1876, having been elected to a fellowship and tutorship in philosophy at New College, where he remained until 1890. His lectures, especially those on Plato's <span class="italic">Republic</span>, were remarkable for their excellent form and clear presentation of philosophical problems, and many distinguished pupils acknowledged their debt to his teaching. It was the period when a social life for married dons was beginning at the university and the Courtneys played an active part in it. He wrote on philosophy and, with Benjamin Jowett's help, promoted the foundation of the New Theatre, and assisted in the production of <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> in Balliol College hall in 1880 and of the early plays of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (founded 1884). In the last enterprise he was associated with amateurs who later achieved fame&#151;Arthur Bourchier, Ernest Holman Clark, and Harry Irving, whose father, Henry Irving, Courtney brought to lecture in Oxford in 1886. He was treasurer of the University Boat Club, and a conspicuous figure on the tow-path. This versatility possibly stood in the way of his reputation as a philosopher.<br>
<br>Courtney was already writing for <span class="italic">The World</span>, and for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, and in 1882 he became assistant to T. H. S. Escott (son of his former headmaster), who was then editing the <span class="italic">Fortnightly</span>. Divided between his devotion to philosophy and the call of a wider sphere, he accepted, in 1890, a post on the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>&#151;by then a staunchly unionist and imperialist paper&#151;where he joined a group of able journalists, including John Merry Le Sage, Henry Duff Traill, and Edward Levy-Lawson (afterwards Lord Burnham), from whom he learned much. He left many friends, not only in New College, which he served with distinction and where he retained his fellowship for life, but in Oxford generally, chief among them being Edward Armstrong and Thomas Case.<br>
<br>Courtney worked for thirty-eight years in Fleet Street, writing general articles, and becoming in the mid-nineties chief drama critic and literary editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, a post he held until 1925; he wrote the weekly &#145;Book of the day&#146;, and always kept in touch with dramatic, literary, and general society at the Garrick Club (joined 1891), the Beefsteak Club (joined 1896), and elsewhere. His scholarly training and dramatic experience, his wide interests and resource in emergency, made him a first-rate journalist. In 1890&#150;91 he edited <span class="italic">Murray's Magazine</span>, but he found his great opportunity when he became editor of the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> in 1894. He kept it at a high level on both the literary and the political side to the end of his life, editing it with sympathy and judgement. He had an uncommon flair for choosing subjects and writers, and delighted in encouraging new talent. For many years he was chairman of the publishing firm of Chapman and Hall.<br>
<br>Courtney's first wife died in 1907, and in 1911 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38617/', "Janet Elizabeth Hogarth")</script>, an old pupil and friend, daughter of the Revd George Hogarth, vicar of Barton upon Humber, Lincolnshire, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33924/', "David George Hogarth")</script>; she shared his life as editor and journalist, to the great happiness of both.<br>
<br>Although Courtney gave up writing on philosophy after leaving Oxford, philosophy and religion remained near to his heart, and most of his writing had a serious note, the outcome of a sane outlook and a high ideal. His influence did much to keep journalism steady at a time of shifting standards. His philosophical studies, <span class="italic">The Metaphysics of John Stuart Mill</span> (1879), <span class="italic">Studies in Philosophy</span> (1882), and <span class="italic">Constructive Ethics</span> (1886), were published in his Oxford period; these were significant contributions, though not at the highest level. Of his later books, collected from his articles or written as holiday studies, the most original was <span class="italic">The Feminine Note in Fiction</span> (1904). His plays had little success.<br>
<br>Courtney was a tall and striking figure, resembling a soldier more than a philosopher. A portrait of him by Sir Hubert von Herkomer at New College is like him, but hardly does justice to his force of character. He was always a genial companion and a loyal friend. He died from cerebral thrombosis and general arteriosclerosis at his home, 36 Westbourne Gardens, London, on 1 November 1928.<br>
