<span class="headword">Herford,  Edward</span>  (1815&#150;1896), <span class="occ">lawyer and public servant</span>, was born in Birmingham on 10 February 1815, the eldest surviving son of the nine children of John Herford, a wine merchant, and Sarah, only daughter of Edward Smith of Birmingham, notary public and Presbyterian dissenter. His younger brothers and sisters included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33835/', "William Henry Herford")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33833/', "Brooke Herford")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69105/', "Anne Laura Herford")</script>.<br>
<br>While an articled clerk in the firm of Kay and Darbishire, Marsden Street, Manchester, Herford became one of the founding members of the Law Students Society in 1833. An active and enthusiastic supporter of the incorporation movement, Herford was one of the first members of the Manchester town council (after incorporation in 1838) at the age of twenty-three. As assistant town clerk he was required, among his other duties, to act as public prosecutor. One of the first prosecutions he undertook was brought in 1840 against Chartists, including Bronterre O'Brien. Herford married, at the Cross Street Unitarian Chapel, Manchester, on 18 September 1846, Harriet (1822/3&#150;1890), daughter of Fenton Robinson Atkinson, solicitor, in whose Manchester legal practice he became a partner. They had four sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>From March 1849 until his death, Herford held the post of Manchester borough coroner. His decision to continue in his role as assistant town clerk as well as acting as borough coroner caused disagreement between himself and the Manchester Law Association and led to his resignation from that body in 1850. Herford resigned as assistant town clerk in August 1851. He became secretary to the coroners' committee of the northern counties.<br>
<br>Edward Herford was an active supporter of the movement to establish lyceums and played a part in the establishment of the Manchester Statistical Society to which he contributed many papers. He was a founder member of the English Church Union formed in 1859 to defend and promote high-church principles in the Church of England; in 1861 he became chairman of the National Association for Promoting the Freedom of Worship. He sought to make the endowments of the established church available to all denominations, and opposed pew rents and the purchase of livings; in 1879 he was the first chairman of the National Committee for Abolishing Purchase in the Church. An often controversial figure, he was a prolific author of pamphlets on economic and financial questions, most of which were published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Manchester Statistical Society</span>. A founder of the Lancashire and Cheshire Association of Mechanics Institutes, he was also an organizer of the Young Men's Anti-Monopoly Association (an offshoot of the Anti-Corn Law League).<br>
<br>In 1882 Herford suffered a stroke, and his work as Manchester coroner was thereafter undertaken by his deputy. He died at his residence, West Bank, Upton, near Macclesfield, on 8 May 1896. After a funeral service in Macclesfield parish church he was buried in Macclesfield cemetery. His eldest son became a Church of England clergyman.<br>
