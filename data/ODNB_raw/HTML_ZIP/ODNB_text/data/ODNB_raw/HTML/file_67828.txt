<span class="headword">Trevelyan,  John</span>  (1903&#150;1986), <span class="occ">film censor</span>, was born on 11 July 1903 at 10 Kemerton Road, Beckenham, Kent, the fourth child and elder son in the family of two sons and four daughters of George Philip Trevelyan (1858&#150;1937), Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Monica Evelyn Juliet (<i>d</i>. 1962), daughter of Sidney Phillips, Church of England clergyman. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31773/', "Humphrey Trevelyan, Baron Trevelyan (1905&#150;1985)")</script>, diplomatist, and his eldest sister was Mary Trevelyan (1897&#150;1983), founder of International Students' House, London. He was educated at Lancing College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a third class in part one of the history tripos in 1924 and graduated BA in 1925. He was married four times. His first wife, whom he married on 18 September 1928, was Kathleen Margaret Pass (<i>b</i>. 1901/2), daughter of Charles Hall&eacute; Pass, gentleman, of Barrow in Furness. They had one son, who was born and died in 1932. Following their divorce in 1949 he married, on 1 June that year, Dr Joan Frieda Scott (<i>b</i>. 1912), medical practitioner and daughter of Francis Clayton Scott, company director, son of Sir James William Schott, later Scott, of Yews in Westmorland, first baronet: they had one son and one daughter. His second divorce, in 1959, was followed by his third marriage, on 7 December that year, to Jean Metcher (1928/9&#150;1972), daughter of Robert Mutch, a railway goods superintendent: they had twin sons. After the death of his third wife he married, in 1974, Rosalie Evelyn Camber (1924/5&#150;1979), daughter of Joseph Lopez-Salzedo, company director.<br>
<br>After teaching in the Gold Coast for a period, Trevelyan in 1929 became an educational administrator, working in Kent and Sussex until his appointment in 1938 as director of education for the county of Westmorland, where, during the Second World War, he had to cope with a huge influx of evacuees from the north-east coast. In 1946 he resigned to take up the post of first director of the British Families Education Service in Germany, where he was responsible for setting up schools for the children of allied servicemen. He left educational administration in 1949 (the year in which he was appointed OBE) to make a living as a freelance writer and lecturer.<br>
<br>In 1951 Trevelyan was invited to join the British Board of Film Censors, which had been set up in 1912 by the film industry in an attempt to stave off interference by local authorities, which had been given legal responsibility for licensing cinemas. In time, the local authorities made it a condition of issuing a licence that the cinema should adopt the board's certificates, although they were able to reverse the decisions of the board, which had no statutory powers. In 1952 Trevelyan was appointed chairman of a new committee, the cinema advisory subcommittee, set up as a forum for discussions between representatives of the licensing authorities, the film industry, and welfare and educational organizations, and in 1958 he was appointed secretary to the board, chosen by representatives of the principal associations of the film industry. Until 1960 the president of the board had sole responsibility for censorship, but in that year the secretary was given joint responsibility with the president, whose role became consultative. Trevelyan served with two presidents: from 1960 to 1965 Lord Morrison of Lambeth held the office, but Trevelyan had a much more successful relationship with his successor, Lord Harlech.<br>
<br>When Trevelyan became a film examiner in 1951, nudity was never allowed in a film: by 1971, when he retired, there were many films which contained material that he considered too pornographic even for adult audiences, and which were consequently refused an X certificate. One of the first films to come to the board after Trevelyan was appointed was <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span> (1958), regarded as a milestone in the history of British film censorship: in contrast to most British and American films of the 1950s, it dealt with real people and real problems, and despite its explicit dialogue it was passed by the board. This was followed by <span class="italic">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</span> (1960), <span class="italic">The L-Shaped Room</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">A Kind of Loving</span> (1962), all passed because Trevelyan considered them to be made with good taste and sincerity. In the 1960s, a period of changing attitudes which saw the coming of the &#145;permissive society&#146;, he had to decide what his responsibilities were: he described himself as &#145;a censor who did not believe in censorship&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). But as a former educator he was especially concerned with protecting children from unsuitable material, and he banned films he regarded as pornographic. He also tackled the increasing portrayal of violence on screen, which he thought justified if it was there to show that violence was inhuman. He believed in the importance of establishing good relations with film-makers and film-company executives, and he often visited studios to watch films being shot, encouraging producers to show him unfinished scripts so that he could advise on whether acceptance was likely. He managed to keep a balanced view, and was widely respected for his tolerant and reasonable approach.<br>
<br>In his thirteen years as secretary Trevelyan was only involved in one <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, in 1970, when the police raided the Open Space Theatre Club during a showing of Andy Warhol's <span class="italic">Flesh</span>, which did not have a certificate. Trevelyan, who had suggested the film be shown there as clubs could show films that did not have a certificate, intervened, and when the directors of the theatre were fined by Hampstead magistrates court, he arranged for Warhol to pay the fines. He subsequently gave <span class="italic">Flesh</span> an X certificate.<br>
<br>Trevelyan was appointed CBE on retirement in 1971. He published <span class="italic">What the Censor Saw</span>, his reflections on the changing role of censorship, in 1973. He died on 15 August 1986 at his home, 35 Braybrooke Gardens, Upper Norwood, London.<br>
