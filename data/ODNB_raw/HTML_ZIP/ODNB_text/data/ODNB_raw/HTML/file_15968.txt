<span class="headword">Lance,  George</span>  (1802&#150;1864), <span class="occ">still-life painter</span>, was born in the manor house of Little Easton, near Dunmow, Essex, on 24 March 1802. His father was the adjutant of the Essex yeomanry, while his mother was the daughter of Colonel Constable of Beverley, Yorkshire. His parents had eloped while his mother was still at boarding-school. The family moved to London during Lance's childhood, when his father became inspector of the Bow Street horse patrol. One contemporary biographer noted that Lance was &#145;born an artist&#146; like &#145;most of those who have achieved distinguished eminence in art&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 103). He favoured picture books over other toys. His family sent him as an adolescent to Leeds to work as a clerk in a factory, a position that is said to have damaged his health. The thirteen-year-old Lance soon returned to London, unhappy with his foray into commerce and determined to become an artist. While studying in the British Museum, he approached Charles Landseer, who was sketching there. During conversation Lance learned that Landseer was a pupil in the studio of Benjamin Robert Haydon and soon after Lance went to Haydon's studio and offered himself as a pupil. He remained there for seven years, studying at the Royal Academy Schools at the same time.<br>
<br>It was in Haydon's studio that Lance fixed upon his artistic speciality: fruit painting. As part of his artistic training Lance produced cartoons of the Parthenon frieze in the British Museum, completed courses in dissection, and also executed studies of fruit and vegetables. A fruit study prepared for a scene from Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> attracted the attention of the collector Sir George Beaumont, who purchased the study. Soon after, both the duke of Bedford and the earl of Shaftesbury commissioned fruit pieces. Haydon himself noted the improbability that an artist trained in his studio would excel at fruit painting rather than history painting; he reportedly told Lance, &#145;it seems a pity to cast off the nobler walk of Art, but I am so convinced you will have no competitor in that you are now following&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1857, 306).<br>
<br>On 15 May 1823 Lance married Sarah Rawles, with whom he had at least two daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Eliza, and a son, George Edmund, a cotton broker of Liverpool. The following year Lance began to exhibit works publicly, sending still-life paintings to the British Institution and to the Society of British Artists. In 1828 he contributed his first work to the Royal Academy exhibition, another still life. Lance continued to exhibit his work publicly throughout his career, with thirty-eight works shown at the Royal Academy, forty-eight at the Suffolk Street Gallery, and 135 at the British Institution. Lance completed more than 400 fruit and other still-life paintings during his career, judged by a contemporary as &#145;wonderful alike for the variety of interest displayed in them, and for the splendour and truthfulness of their execution&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 103). During his lifetime his paintings were compared to those of the Dutch old masters and lavishly praised: &#145;his &#147;fruit-pieces&#148;, which are his speciality, have never been surpassed in luxuriance and richness of colour, in truth, and in effective and most harmonious grouping&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1857, 305). Works by Lance are currently held in the National Gallery, the Tate collection, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
<br>Although known for his still-life works, Lance frequently produced paintings in other genres. In 1836 he won the prize for best historical picture of the season at the Liverpool Academy with <span class="italic">Melancthon's First Misgiving of the Church of Rome</span> (Manchester City Galleries). In addition, he executed portraits, such as <span class="italic">Dr. William Forbes</span> (NPG) and <span class="italic">Rev. William Harness</span> (Tate collection). Self-portraits of Lance are in the collections of both the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, London. However, after 1845 he painted exclusively still-life works, exhibiting publicly for the last time in 1862. Throughout his career Lance accepted pupils, including Sir John Gilbert and William Duffield&#151;reputedly his favourite pupil&#151;whose death at the age of thirty-one greatly affected Lance.<br>
<br>Little is known of Lance's personal life. He lived for most of his life in London, retiring for health reasons to Cheshire in 1862. He died at Sunnyside, New Brighton, Wallasey, Cheshire, on 18 June 1864. Interestingly, a contemporary biographer notes: &#145;a daughter of Mr. Lance follows in her father's career, evincing considerable ability&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 103).<br>
