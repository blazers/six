<span class="headword">Owen,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1499&#150;1558), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born about 1499 in the diocese of Worcester, and was educated at Oxford. He became probationer fellow of Merton College in 1519 and graduated MA in 1521. He was keeper of the Bourgchier chest in 1520&#150;21, the Chichele and Audley chest also in 1521, and the Danvers chest from 1522 to 1524. At Merton he was first bursar 1524&#150;5 and third bursar 1525&#150;6. He seems to have been destined for the church, but on marrying Lettice, a widow from Suffolk, he took up medicine, having first attempted to trade as a white baker in Oxford without becoming a freeman of the city. He took his BM in 1525 and his DM in 1528. In 1525 Owen received a licence to practise medicine, and at first worked in Oxford, but soon after his graduation he was appointed physician to Henry VIII, and frequently visited the court. He, together with John Chambre and William Butts, attended the birth of Prince Edward in 1537, and he was a signatory to the letter to the council announcing the serious condition of the child's mother, Jane Seymour. The statement that he performed a caesarean section upon her is untrue. Through 1537 and 1538 he was often summoned to prescribe for the prince. The king proved a generous patron, and during the dissolution of the monasteries made him many grants of lands and houses in Oxford and its neighbourhood, to which Owen added by extensive purchases. In 1537 he was given New Hall and St Alban Hall in Oxford with a fee of &pound;100 (these buildings were subsequently sold to Merton College) and he was allowed to purchase the manor of Yarnton, Oxfordshire. In March 1540 he acquired Godstow Abbey for &pound;558 and in 1541 he bought Walton and Wolvercote manors and the site of Rewley Abbey, which he soon passed on to Christ Church, for &pound;1174. In 1546, together with Dr John Bridges, he acquired Cumnor Place for &pound;1300. Godstow Abbey became Owen's main home. He was one of the subscribing witnesses to the will of Henry VIII, who left him a legacy of &pound;100.<br>
<br>Edward VI kept Owen as royal physician, and treated him with as much generosity as his father. From 1547 he was seemingly able to use the duchy of Lancaster's money as his own, having been appointed a receiver-general on 30 September that year. In 1550 he bought the rectory and chapel of St Giles', Oxford, and on 4 February 1553 Edward gave him, jointly with Henry Martin of Oxford, Durham College, which they sold a year later to Sir Thomas Pope for the site of his projected Trinity College. He received a grant of arms from Edward, and, on 25 October 1552, a royal grant of land of the value of &pound;20 a year. These acquisitions made Owen the greatest landowner to the north-west of Oxford, and brought him into conflict with Sir John Williams over rights in Wytham Woods, and with the city over Port meadow. Fortunately his eldest son, Richard, married Mary, daughter of Sir Leonard Chamberlain, Mary's leading supporter, after Williams, in the area.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Owen was taking a prominent place in his profession, and was held in esteem by the public. John Leland addressed an encomium &#145;Ad D. Audoenum medicum regium&#146;, and, according to his friend Thomas Caius, he and Queen Katherine Parr joined in inducing Caius to translate into English Erasmus's paraphrase of <span class="roman">St Mark's gospel</span>. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians on 25 June 1545; an elect in 1552, in place of John Chambre, deceased; and on 2 October 1553 was elected president, an office to which he was reappointed the following year.<br>
<br>Owen was present at the death of Edward VI, being the last person to speak to him, but this did not mark the end of his royal connection: he was nominated royal physician on Mary's accession, and in the first year of the new reign he was instrumental in obtaining an act for the confirmation and enlargement of the powers of the College of Physicians. Two years later, when a difference arose between the College of Physicians and the University of Oxford concerning the admission by the latter of Simon Ludford and David Laughton to the degree of bachelor of medicine, Cardinal Pole, then chancellor of the university, directed that body to consult Owen and Dr Thomas Huys, the queen's physicians, &#145;de instituendis rationibus quibus Oxoniensis academia in admittendis medicis niteretur&#146;. Owen and his colleague suggested an agreement which the chancellor approved and ratified.<br>
<br>Owen remained until his death on friendly terms with Queen Mary. In 1554 he testified that Princess Elizabeth was well enough to answer the queen's summons after Wyatt's rebellion, and, in the spring of 1555, Mary sent him to Woodstock to report on Elizabeth's health. At the new year of 1556 he presented the queen with &#145;two pottles of preserves&#146;  (Madden, 254). Owen was made a JP in Oxfordshire in 1547 and was a commissioner of relief in 1550. In 1558 he was returned to parliament for Oxfordshire. He married twice, the second time to Mary. He died of an epidemic intermittent fever on 18 October 1558, and was buried on 24 October in London at St Stephen Walbrook. He was the author of a treatise named <span class="italic">A Meet Diet for the New Ague, Set Forth by Mr. Dr. Owen</span>, published in 1558.<br>
<br>Owen left a son, William, and two daughters, Lettice and Elizabeth, beside the aforementioned Richard, all from his first marriage. William, the second son, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Rawley of Billesby, Northamptonshire, were living at Cumnor Place when Amy Robsart, wife of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, met her mysterious death there in 1560. William Owen sold Cumnor to Anthony Forster in 1572, and in the same year was elected MP for Oxford. He seems to have retained his father's property at Godstow, and lived there.<br>
<br>John Owen, described in 1615 as a Roman Catholic, of Godstow, was Richard Owen's grandson, and great-grandson of George Owen. He achieved some notoriety in 1615 by being charged with using the treasonable expression that it was lawful to kill the king, since he was excommunicate. The jury brought in a verdict of guilty, and sentence of death was passed, but, after remaining in prison in the king's bench for three years, Owen was pardoned on 24 July 1618, at the request of the Spanish ambassador, on condition of his leaving the country within twenty days.<br>
