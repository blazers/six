<span class="headword">Peel,  Albert</span>  (1887&#150;1949), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and historian</span>, was born on 20 March 1887 at Craven Lane, Gomersal, near Dewsbury, Yorkshire, the eldest of three children of Rawson Peel, a joiner journeyman, and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garnett. He attended Heckmondwike grammar school and, after working as a pupil teacher at Birstall, went in 1906 to the Yorkshire United Independent College, Bradford, to train for the Congregational ministry. Customarily Yorkshire College students took their degrees from Edinburgh University but Peel elected to take a BA from Leeds University, gaining first-class honours in history in 1909. He then spent two years at Oxford, acquiring a BLitt and concurrently a Leeds MA and an intermediate BD from London University. He also attended lectures at Mansfield College, Oxford, in 1910&#150;11, as the equivalent of his first theological year in Yorkshire. These exertions severely taxed his health. In 1915 Peel was awarded the LittD from Leeds, the first to receive this degree from the university. Peel appreciated his mentors, especially Sir Charles Firth, A. J. Grant of Leeds, W. B. Selbie of Mansfield College, and, in London, T. G. Crippen, the Congregational librarian.<br>
<br>Peel was ordained on 17 September 1913 at Great Harwood Congregational Church, Blackburn, Lancashire. He married in 1913 Ethel Constance Harrop (1888&#150;1971), daughter of William Harrop, minister of Furthergate Congregational Church, Blackburn, and they had a daughter, Margaret. In 1922 Peel became minister of Clapton Park Congregational Church, London, where he proved both conscientious and innovative. He regularly worked between twelve and fourteen hours a day, including Sundays, writing, reading two books daily, and visiting, showing particular sympathy for the disadvantaged. In 1934 he resigned his pastorate but continued to preach his fluent, natural sermons on most Sundays.<br>
<br>In 1915 Peel's researches resulted in his editing the two volumes of <span class="italic">The Seconde Parte of a Register</span>, a calendar of sixteenth-century separatist manuscripts, to which Firth contributed the preface. In 1920 Peel published two important pamphlets, <span class="italic">The Brownists in Norwich and Norfolk about 1580</span> and <span class="italic">The first Congregational churches: new light on separatist congregations in London, 1567&#150;1581</span>. In the latter he outlined his hope to write a detailed study of Elizabethan puritanism and separatism, a hope often renewed but sadly unrealized. Yet Peel became the English historian of sixteenth-century separatism.<br>
<br>In 1923 Peel founded the <span class="italic">Congregational Quarterly</span>, a serious theological journal, which he edited until 1945. In 1924 he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Congregational Historical Society</span> (founded 1901), a position he held at his death. Peel also became a director of the Independent Press at its founding in 1924 by the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and from 1929 he took charge of the Congregational Library. With so much activity historical research, although never abandoned, was given a low priority. In London, together with several minor publications, Peel produced a history of the Congregational Union, <span class="italic">These Hundred Years</span> (1931), and a significant study of the Elizabethan separatists in <span class="italic">Essays Congregational and Catholic</span> (1931), which he edited. In 1937 he wrote with Sir John Marriott the biography <span class="italic">Robert Forman Horton</span>. He was a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, publishing for it <span class="italic">The Note-Book of John Penry, 1593</span> (1944), and was transcribing a manuscript in the library of St John's College, Cambridge, which, after Peel's death, was prepared by Norman Sykes for publication as <span class="italic">Tracts Ascribed to Richard Bancroft</span> (1953). He often visited the United States of America, being awarded honorary doctorates from Carlton, Minnesota, and Rockford, Illinois.<br>
<br>In the late 1940s Peel developed a project to provide definitive editions of the Elizabethan puritan and separatist writings, persuading his fellow trustees of the Sir Halley Stewart Trust to finance the scheme. When Peel died the first volume was in page proof and Leland H. Carlson agreed to continue this series. <span class="italic">Cartwrightiana</span> (1951) and <span class="italic">The Writings of Robert Harrison and Robert Browne</span> (1953) appeared under their joint editorship, while subsequent volumes were edited by Carlson alone. Peel's failure to write the history of Elizabethan puritanism and separatism marked a loss to scholarship and to his own fulfilment. He served as chairman of the Congregational Union in 1940&#150;41. Increasingly isolated in later years, the uncompromising Peel continued to stress theological freedom when ministerial students were taught to value dogma, creeds, and written liturgies, especially by Nathaniel Micklem, then principal of Mansfield College.<br>
<br>Peel enjoyed cricket and was of medium height and build. Although outspoken and with few social graces, he was affable and clubbable. Relations with his wife in time became less easy. From 1926 to 1949 he lived at 97 Russell Road, Buckhurst Hill, Essex, although sometimes he stayed overnight at his office at Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, London. Peel died from heart failure on 3 November 1949 at the McAlpin Nursing Home in Glasgow and was cremated in Glasgow. His ashes were taken to Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire.<br>
