<span class="headword">Willis,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1630&#150;1660), <span class="occ">Clubman leader</span>, was probably born at Woolavington, Somerset. His father was another Humphrey Willis (1589/90&#150;1618); his mother was Martha Drury (<i>d</i>. 1654), who was related to a more prominent family, the Pophams of Huntworth. They were married clandestinely in Wells Cathedral in 1606. Both Humphrey's father and grandfather claimed gentility but there was some uncertainty about the legitimacy of their coat of arms. They held their lands in Woolavington from the Pym family, who were lords of the manor; some of the land was copyhold at fixed rent and fines, some of it leasehold for lives. The Willis's holdings under both tenures, amounting to over 35 acres, were scattered across the Woolavington common fields, and this led to some complicated disputes between them and their landlord, John Pym. A chancery suit between Pym and Martha Smythe (Humphrey Willis's mother, who had remarried) was eventually arbitrated in 1632. Willis thus grew up in a family accustomed to defending its legal rights even against a lawyer as formidable as the great John Pym.<br>
<br>Little is known about Willis's life before the civil war beyond the fact that during an altercation in an inn at Weare in 1630 he was alleged to be keeping a whore. In June 1645, however, he emerged as the leader of the Clubmen of mid-Somerset, who like their counterparts elsewhere wished to protect their properties from the armies of both sides, and adopted an ostensibly neutral stance between king and parliament. But, unlike most of the Wiltshire and Dorset Clubmen, Willis and his followers were clearly more friendly to parliament than to the king. On 30 June an acquaintance of the royalist Sir Humphrey Mildmay was captured by Clubmen and taken before their leader, whom Mildmay scornfully refers to as &#145;Lord Willis&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 454, fol. 75<i>v</i>). Willis also turned up that day at a great meeting of local people on Sedgemoor in the Somerset levels, which was intended to create a neutralist organization. In a long speech Willis offered suggestions about the Clubmen's future course of action which show considerable political sophistication. On 11 July, the day after their victory at Langport, Sir Thomas Fairfax's troops were drawn up on Sedgemoor while the Clubmen of the Polden villages gathered on Knowle Hill, a few miles away. Willis had a friendly meeting with the general, assuring him that the purpose of their meeting was simply &#145;for safeguard of their goods, and for peace&#146;  (Underdown, 108). The encounter strengthened the co-operation between Willis's Clubmen and the New Model Army.<br>
<br>After the civil war, however, Willis became increasingly disenchanted with parliament, and especially with the radical county committee through which it governed Somerset. In the county election at Ilchester in December 1645 he vocally supported the moderate William Strode against the committee's candidates, asserting that he could deliver 500 votes for Strode. In the following June he was alleged to be exploiting the countrymen's resentments about military rule, and to be trying to provoke another rising of Clubmen, this time against the committee. He was arrested and imprisoned at Weymouth, where he composed a bitter diatribe against the committee. His confinement, he declared, was against &#145;Scripture, <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, and the Petition of Right&#146;  (H. Willis, <span class="italic">The Power of the Committee of the County of Somerset</span>, 1646, title-page). Early in 1647 Willis launched another attack on the committee and its chairman, John Pyne, in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Time's Whirligig, or, The Blew-New-Made Gentleman Mounted</span>. The title-page depicts a committeeman arrogantly ordering the arrest of a suspect while standing on an inverted globe. The allusion to the world turned upside down is further developed in the pamphlet's doggerel verses, in which members of the committee are denounced as both dangerous revolutionaries and social upstarts.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Willis's life between February 1647 and the summer of 1659, when he wrote another attack on the republican leaders; it was published early in 1660 under the title <span class="italic">England's Changeling</span> with some revisions expressing its author's hopes from General Monck. The bulk of the pamphlet, obviously written during the rule of the restored Rump, repeats Willis's earlier complaints about the republic's destruction of the legitimate authority of the gentry. He again disappears from the historical record after the Restoration. He may have died in Glamorgan in 1687.<br>
<br>Although his family claimed higher status, and his pamphlets variously describe him as &#145;captain&#146; and &#145;esquire&#146;, Willis was a spokesman for the English countrymen, the yeomen and husbandmen who were the main supporters of the Club movement during the later stages of the civil war. Like nearly all of them he wanted to restore a proper balance to society and ensure that government was based on &#145;the ancient and fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Power of the Committee</span>, 1). The civil war, he declared, had been undertaken &#145;Lest arbitrary Power should State and liberty devoure&#146;  (<span class="italic">England's Changeling</span>). Parliament, and particularly its local agents, had betrayed these goals in order to achieve their own selfish ends. Willis's career and writings illustrate the movement of popular opinion from the general support for parliament that existed in 1642 to the covert royalism of the later 1640s.<br>
