<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson,  George Walter Gillow</span>  (1901&#150;1972), <span class="occ">naval officer and sheep farmer</span>, was born on 6 June 1901, the second son of the Revd Robert Henry Bridges Simpson (1862&#150;1935), vicar of Oakwood, Surrey, and his wife, Sophie, n&eacute;e Thomson. He became widely known by his sobriquet, Shrimp, throughout a naval career spanning nearly forty years from cadet to rear-admiral. The nickname was justified by his bare 5 feet and 2 inches; but it did not prepare unknowing challengers for the crackling blue eyes set in craggy features surmounting a sturdy figure&#151;a figure that was liable to sway back on its heels before delivering a pungent comment beginning, good-naturedly enough, &#145;I say, old chap &hellip;&#146;. Simpson attended the Royal Naval College at Osborne and Dartmouth from 1915 for two and a half years before he was promoted midshipman early, with his term-mates, and sent to sea at the age of sixteen in accordance with Admiralty directives for young gentlemen in the First World War.<br>
<br>Simpson was thrilled at the thought of active service, but became disillusioned after arriving in one of the sadistically administered gunrooms of the period to be bullied and beaten as a junior wart. The experience scarred; but it forced Simpson to reflect on the cause of stultifying conditions, unrelieved boredom, and poor morale in generally idle capital ships. It was a situation engendered, in his opinion, by tradition&#151;a word he described as the harlot of vocabulary, and which he resisted thereafter when proposing policies that did not always suit the Whitehall hierarchy. However, while railing against the worst aspects of tradition Simpson ignored the best, which he himself so well exemplified. And, as he proved in his professional autobiography <span class="italic">Periscope View</span> (1972), the Royal Navy demonstrated superb fighting qualities in the Second World War.<br>
<br>The Submarine Service, more vigorous and less traditional than the surface fleet, was a natural choice for Simpson's career: he joined it in 1921, but an anticipated early command was delayed by his studying to become a Russian interpreter and a spell as first lieutenant of the big submarine <i>Thames</i> (which required a qualified commanding officer as second in command) followed by a staff course. He commanded <i>L27</i> briefly in 1935 and, for some fifteen months from August 1938, the large mine-laying and general purpose submarine <i>Porpoise</i> where he made a somewhat contentious mark by stressing the effectiveness of torpedo attacks compared (by implication) with big-ship gunnery. However, Simpson's greatest service to the navy was compressed into two strenuous years from January 1941 to January 1943 while he commanded the flotilla of submarines (to become famous as the Fighting Tenth) based on the beleaguered island of Malta.<br>
<br>Malta, in the centre of the Mediterranean and the only British harbour between Gibraltar and Alexandria, had long been crucial to the Royal Navy's strategy; but now the small island, wholly reliant on seaborne supplies for its military and civilian needs, was susceptible to siege by air forces and very difficult to defend. Grand harbour could not safely be used by surface ships, but submarines were able to lie in Marsamxett where the solid old Lazaretto isolation hospital offered protection for personnel and some shelter for submarines alongside. None the less, several submarines were destroyed or damaged by bombing in Maltese harbours; and Simpson sometimes had to order boats to dive by day, albeit jeopardizing maintenance and relaxation between patrols. He noted that pre-war excavation of cave-like pens had been halted for the sake of economy: the entire project would have cost the same as one medium-sized submarine.<br>
<br>Admiral A. B. Cunningham, commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, assigned Simpson the prime task of preventing supplies and reinforcements from Italy reaching axis armies in north Africa. The enemy supply lines could be reached in a day or so by the slow, small U-class submarines which constituted the flotilla proper: temporary visitors of other classes were generally employed further afield. Proximity permitted three or four regulars to be on patrol at any one time; but wartime dangers were exacerbated by confined and revealingly clear waters, a shortage of torpedoes, and increasingly expert enemy counter-measures. Submarine casualties were heavy throughout the Mediterranean. Twenty-three boats were sunk during his time at Malta: twelve had sailed from his flotilla and two were bombed in harbour. But Simpson, with a cheerfully unpretentious brand of leadership and an absurdly small staff, consistently ran the show at peak efficiency despite daunting discouragements. More to the point his tenth flotilla did all that was required of it, and more.<br>
<br>Simpson was relieved by George Phillips in January 1943 and was taking passage in HMS <i>Welshman</i> when she was sunk by <i>U-617</i>; but he was able to take up an appointment at Londonderry in the battle against U-boats, and he went on to command the cruiser <i>Birmingham</i>. He became first naval member and chief of New Zealand navy staff in 1948, flag officer, Germany, in 1951, and he was flag officer, submarines, from 1952 until he retired in 1954. He had married, in 1945, Alison, daughter of Captain L. J. Hall. They had two sons and a daughter. In retirement, with his wife and young family, he took up a new and physically demanding sheep-farming life in New Zealand. He died there on 2 March 1972, at 70 Kiripaka Road, Whangarei, Northland, New Zealand.<br>
<br>Simpson was utterly dependable. In a memorial address Admiral Sammy Woods recalled his strength: &#145;Looking back &hellip; I am chiefly struck by the man's rock-like stability&#146;  (Woods).<br>
