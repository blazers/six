<span class="headword">Scully,  Denys</span>  (1773&#150;1830), <span class="occ">barrister and political activist</span>, was the eldest surviving son (with three brothers and two sisters) of James Scully (1738&#150;1816), a prosperous grazier of Kilfeacle, co. Tipperary, and Catherine Lyons (1739&#150;1818) of Croom, co. Limerick. He was born at Kilfeacle on 4 May 1773. After schooling at the Kilkenny Academy (1785&#150;6) he was destined for a commercial career but switched to the law when an act of 1792 admitted Catholics to the Irish bar, to which he was called from the Middle Temple in 1796 after concurrently completing his education at Trinity College, Cambridge. On 25 November 1801 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1806), eldest daughter of Ferdinand Huddleston of Sawston Hall near Cambridge. Her family were neighbours of the lord lieutenant, Philip Yorke, third earl of Hardwicke, and brought Scully an introduction to the viceregal court. On the renewal of the war with France in 1803 he published a pamphlet urging his countrymen not to side with the French and was seen for a time as a &#145;Castle Catholic&#146;. When a new Catholic committee was formed in the autumn of 1804, however, he took the lead in thwarting the viceroy's efforts to get a petition suppressed and was a member of a delegation which was received by Pitt on 12 March 1805 and on his refusal of support turned to the opposition.<br>
<br>During the next three years, marked by the ascendancy of John Keogh, Scully stood aside from the committee. His first wife died without children on 17 April 1806, and on 8 September 1808 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of Vincent Eyre of Sheffield Park, who brought him a dowry of &pound;14,000 and with whom he had nine children. The youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46336/', "William Francis John Scully")</script>, made his fortune in land speculation. From 1809 on Scully and Daniel O'Connell were leaders of the popular party, opposed to any form of government veto on the nomination of bishops. While O'Connell steadily established his ascendancy, Scully, a poor speaker and temperamentally inclined to manipulate others, worked mainly behind the scenes. Only in 1811&#150;12 did he achieve momentary fame with his <span class="italic">Penal Laws</span>, published at the height of an agitation which he himself had fomented by convoking an assembly of elected delegates to test the 1793 <span class="roman">Convention Act</span> in the courts. Discouraged by repeated failure at Westminster, and distracted by family litigation over his father's will, he became less active after 1817. Fat as a young man, Scully was &#145;fully as broad as he is long&#146; when he was felled by a stroke in May 1823. In a pamphlet of 1824 he criticized O'Connell for taking up grievances that were not specifically Catholic ones. After another stroke he died at Kilfeacle on 25 October 1830, and was buried in the Scully plot on the Rock of Cashel.<br>
<br>Scully's second son, <a name="cosubject_24979"></a><span class="headword">Vincent Scully</span>  (1810&#150;1871), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born on 8 September 1810. He rose to be a QC. He sat as a Liberal for Cork in the parliament of 1852&#150;7, showing a special interest in free trade in land. In 1856 his reputation suffered from the Tipperary Bank crash, as he was a nominal director and a cousin of the swindler John Sadleir. In 1859, however, he was re-elected, and sat until 1865. He married Susanna Grogan (<i>d</i>. 1874) on 6 September 1841 and died at Grove End, London, on 4 June 1871. He was credited with a punning sense of humour, an example of which is perhaps to be found in the motto inscribed on Scully's Cross, erected by him beside his father's tomb on the Rock of Cashel: <i>In hoc signo vincent</i> (&#145;In this sign shall they conquer&#146;).<br>
