<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  John  Morris-</span>  (1864&#150;1929), <span class="occ">Welsh scholar and poet</span>, was born at Trefor, Llandrygarn, Anglesey, on 17 October 1864, the eldest son of Morris Jones (<i>d</i>. 1879) and his wife, Elizabeth Roberts, shopkeepers, both originally of Llanrug, Caernarvonshire. When he was three years old his parents moved to Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, Anglesey, and he went to the local school, the Duchess of Kent's, and the board school. From 1876 to January 1879 he attended the Friars' School, Bangor, under the headmastership of Daniel Lewis Lloyd (afterwards bishop of Bangor), and when Lloyd left for Christ College, Brecon, Jones was one of the many Friars' boys to go with him.<br>
<br>Jones's father died at Christmas 1879, and his help was now required at home. He assisted his mother for a year in the shop, but managed to find time to read a considerable amount of Welsh literature, especially poetry, and the beauty of the old <i>cywyddau</i> and <i>englynion</i> captured his imagination so completely that he could barely tolerate any other kind of verse again. Lloyd had a high opinion of his former pupil's gifts as a mathematician, and made it possible for Jones to return to Brecon early in 1881 in order to read for a mathematical scholarship at Oxford. But the old zest had gone. The year at home had roused in him such an interest in Welsh poetry that mathematics took second place. He did win a scholarship, and went to Jesus College, Oxford, in October 1883, but obtained only a third-class degree in mathematics in 1887. A Meyricke scholarship from his college, tenable for a year, then enabled him to follow his real bent. He had already attended the lectures of John Rh&#375;s on Celtic; he now devoted himself wholly to Welsh, and began to prepare an edition of <span class="italic">The Elucidarium</span> and other tracts in Welsh from <span class="italic">Llyvyr agkyr llandewivrevi</span>, which appeared under his name and that of Rh&#375;s in 1894.<br>
<br>Jones and six others had already (6 May 1886) founded the Dafydd ap Gwilym Society in Oxford for the discussion of Welsh language, literature, and culture. Two of the first members, Jones himself and Owen Morgan Edwards, were to play the leading parts in the revival of Welsh literature. Edwards focused upon history and Welsh prose; Jones on philology and Welsh verse. Both felt the need of a more regular and scientific orthography; both loved purity of idiom and diction, although Edwards found his models in the living dialect and Jones in the medieval poetry. Vigorous discussions at the Dafydd paved the way for the work of the orthographical committee of the Society for Utilizing the Welsh Language (Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg), whose report on <span class="italic">Welsh Orthography</span> was published in 1893, Jones acting as secretary. He did most of the work on this report, and for years afterwards in controversy after controversy he defended this &#145;Oxford Welsh&#146;, as it was called, against all comers.<br>
<br>Jones was appointed lecturer in Welsh at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, in January 1889. The charter of the University of Wales was granted royal approval at the end of 1893, and he was elected professor of Welsh in 1895, holding the post until his death. The new University of Wales gave him students in plenty, and through them his lectures on Welsh grammar became known throughout Wales. In 1897 he married Mary, second daughter of William Hughes of Siglan, Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, with whom he had four daughters.<br>
<br>Jones studied the versification of the medieval poets and dealt faithfully, if not tenderly, with Joseph Loth's <span class="italic">M&eacute;trique Galloise</span> in the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Celtische Philologie</span> (vol. 4, 1903). His own skill in the ancient technique of the bards was demonstrated by the ode &#145;Cymru fu, Cymru fydd&#146;, printed in <span class="italic">Cymru</span> (1892) and later with other poems in his only published volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Caniadau</span> (1907). Jones's exposure of the falsity of the claims made by Iolo Morganwg on behalf of the gorsedd appeared in <span class="italic">Cymru</span> for 1896, and in the same year, curiously enough, he gave his adjudication on the odes, the chief poetic competition, at the national eisteddfod held at Llandudno. This was the first of a series of pronouncements, continuing until 1927, on correct Welsh and correct prosody given by him at this popular assembly, which made his name famous throughout Wales and helped to spread his doctrines. He castigated sloppy work with ruthless severity; no man did more to raise the standard of poetic diction in the eisteddfod poetry.<br>
<br>Although Jones's chief interest lay in the strict alliterative metres, he also helped to perfect the form of the free lyric by his translations from Heine, J. L. Uhland, and others; in particular his translation of &#145;Umar Khayyam, <span class="italic">Penillion Omar Khayy&acirc;m wedi eu cyfieithu o'r berseg i'r Gymraeg</span> (1928), merits mention. His chief contribution to the study of Welsh prosody and, in the opinion of many, his best work, is his <span class="italic">Cerdd dafod</span> (1925), a full account of Welsh metric art in which he displayed his belief that a Welsh literary and linguistic revival was impossible without a careful study of the Welsh literature of the past. It was also of immense importance for its practical demonstration that Welsh was an appropriate language for the discussion and publication of detailed scholarly material.<br>
<br>Another of Jones's important contributions to Welsh prose is the masterly introduction to Ellis Wynne's <span class="italic">Gweledigaetheu y bardd cwsc</span> (1898), which is significant not only for its discussion of Ellis Wynne's sources but also for its stylistic analysis, which displayed Jones's characteristic dedication to the purity of the Welsh language. He edited the quarterly magazine <span class="italic">Y Beirniad</span> (&#145;The Critic&#146;) from start to finish (1911&#150;19), but wrote little himself for that periodical, although he spent a great deal of time in editorial work. Occasional articles from his pen appeared in various magazines: notably his &#145;Tudur Aled&#146; in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Cymmrodorion (1908&#150;9) and the review in English in <span class="italic">Cymmrodor</span> (vol. 28, 1918) of the edition of the <span class="roman">Book of Taliesin</span> by John Gwenogvryn Evans.<br>
<br>Jones's <span class="italic">Welsh Grammar, Historical and Comparative</span> (1913), although limited in that it deals only with phonology and accidence, is a key work in the scholarship of the Welsh language. It was followed by an unfinished draft, printed posthumously in 1931 as <span class="italic">Welsh Syntax</span>. Both texts display a remarkable gift of lucid exposition, and skill in the clear arrangement and presentation of grammatical facts.<br>
<br>Jones was knighted in 1918, when he began to style himself Morris-Jones. In 1919 Glasgow University conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD, and in 1927 the National University of Ireland that of doctor of Celtic letters. He died after a brief illness at his home, T&#375; Coch, at Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, on 16 April 1929, and was buried in the cemetery of that village.<br>
