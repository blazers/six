<span class="headword">Hayler,  Guy</span>  (1850&#150;1943), <span class="occ">temperance advocate</span>, was born, of Huguenot descent, on 5 November 1850 at 3 Market Green, Battle, Sussex, the youngest son of George Hayler, a Chartist tailor of Battle, and his wife, Mary Wood Brignall, eldest daughter of John Brignall of Wittersham, Kent. The family soon moved to nearby Hastings. At six Guy Hayler took the teetotal pledge on a blacksmith's anvil and joined the Band of Hope, a children's temperance organization. In 1864, having been orphaned, he moved to Kent, and a year later he moved to London.<br>
<br>In London Hayler became a working-class temperance enthusiast and political radical while working in the building and decorating trades. He frequently visited the offices of the United Kingdom Alliance, the prohibitionist organization, and William Tweedie's temperance bookshop. In 1870 he joined a Good Templar lodge that met above Tweedie's shop. The Good Templars, a working-class and lower middle-class fraternal temperance society that originated in the United States, had arrived in England two years earlier, and Hayler met his future wife at a lodge meeting. The young Hayler was a political radical; for instance, in 1870 he helped to organize the International Democratic Association's demonstration at Hyde Park in support of the French commune.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1874, at St Mark's, Kennington, Hayler married Ann Elizabeth (1848&#150;1941), only daughter of Henry Hartley Harriss of Maidstone; they had four sons and four daughters. In the same year Hayler left London to spend more than three decades as a temperance organizer in northern England. He lived for sixteen years at Hull, as agent and, later, secretary for the local alliance auxiliary, and then for eighteen years at Newcastle upon Tyne, as general secretary of the North of England Temperance League. He held concurrent temperance offices, was active in the co-operative movement and building societies, and edited several newspapers, the most important of which was the league's <span class="italic">Temperance Witness</span>; he also founded the National Association of Official Temperance Advocates. While working for the league he became an ally of the aristocratic prohibitionist Rosalind Howard, countess of Carlisle.<br>
<br>When the crushing defeat of the Liberal Party in the general election of 1895 made many of its supporters doubt whether prohibition by local option was practicable, Hayler responded by organizing a national prohibition convention. Always optimistic and cheerful, he never lost faith in a future in which people would embrace prohibition as the only answer to the drink problem. Following the collapse of his health at the end of 1906 he gave up his work as a regional temperance organizer and, in his late fifties, began a new phase of his life, as a propagandist for worldwide prohibition; as early as 1905 he had held international office with the Good Templars. Having returned to London in 1909, after the recovery of his health, he served as honorary president of a propaganda organization, known first as the International Prohibition Confederation and then as the World Prohibition Federation, from its formation in 1909 to 1939. From 1917 until his death he edited a quarterly that reported news about prohibition: the <span class="italic">International Record</span>. In 1919, when the Anti-Saloon League of America, in the triumphant early days of national prohibition, founded the World League against Alcoholism, the World Prohibition Federation lost prestige.<br>
<br>After his return to London Hayler lived in a villa named Courtfield, at South Norwood Park, that became famous for its temperance library of innumerable books and periodicals, annual reports, pamphlets, and posters. Shortly after his death German bombs demolished the house, but much of the library survived. The University of Wisconsin purchased part of it, and thirty-five volumes of pamphlets at Wisconsin have been preserved on microfilm. In his books and pamphlets Hayler often incorporated excerpts from other temperance and government publications, especially statistics; he was more an editor than an original writer. His best-known publications included <span class="italic">The Master Method: an Enquiry into the Liquor Problem in America</span> (1901), <span class="italic">Famous Fanatics</span> (1910), <span class="italic">Prohibition Advance in All Lands: a Study of the World-Wide Character of the Drink Question</span> (1913), and <span class="italic">The New Europe and Prohibition: a Post War Survey</span> (1923). He also published a novel, <span class="italic">George Proctor, the Teetotaler</span> (1895). In 1918 he contested eastern Surrey as an independent Liberal but was defeated by the coalition Conservative, Sir S. A. Coats, of the thread manufacturing company.<br>
<br>All Hayler's children were teetotallers. Mark H. C. Hayler (1887&#150;1986) served as executive secretary of the World Prohibition Federation and after his father's death succeeded him as editor of the <span class="italic">International Record</span>, which ceased publication in 1968. A member of the United Kingdom Alliance executive council from 1938 to 1984, he is best known as the author of a history of the temperance alliance, <span class="italic">The Vision of a Century, 1853&#150;1953</span> (1953). He and his brother Glen were imprisoned as conscientious objectors when they refused non-combatant service during the First World War. The eldest son, (Guy) Wilfrid, emigrated to the United States, where he was a successful architect and urban planner.<br>
<br>Hayler's wife, Ann, died on 30 May 1941. He himself died at Mayday Hospital, Croydon, on 23 September 1943, and was cremated at Streatham Park, Wandsworth, on 28 September; a Congregational minister officiated at the funeral.<br>
