<span class="headword">Keeling,  Dorothy Clarissa</span>  (1881&#150;1967), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born at Grammar School House, Manor Row, Bradford, on 2 December 1881, the seventh of nine children of the Revd William Hulton Keeling (1840&#150;1916), for many years headmaster of Bradford grammar school, and his wife, Henrietta Frances Gedge (<i>d</i>. 1905). Keeling was educated at home and at a girls' grammar school, but physical weakness in childhood barred her from serious academic work and deterred her from following the family vocation of teaching. She had, however, &#145;an intense interest from childhood in people&#146;, and while she continued to live at home after leaving school at the age of eighteen, she overcame the reservations of her overprotective family and a severe stammer to become involved in voluntary social work. After some experience with workhouse visiting, in 1907 she joined the staff of the Bradford Guild of Help, which had been founded in 1905. Drawing on the model of the &#145;Elberfeld system&#146; in Germany, the Edwardian Guilds of Help promoted a vision of social betterment that drew on ideals of cross-class &#145;friendship&#146; and civic participation; Guild volunteers visited needy or distressed families, less to dispense relief than to help the family devise a strategy for rehabilitation. Keeling held the position of honorary assistant secretary for the Bradford Guild of Help for ten years, undertaking &#145;an immense amount&#146; of visiting and supervising both the work of the Guild's district heads and the practical training of students from the Leeds University school of social work.<br>
<br>After her father's death in 1916 Keeling became self-supporting, accepting first a salary for her work in Bradford and then the secretaryship of the National Association of Guilds of Help, headquartered in Manchester. It was with this background that she was hired in 1918 as the first secretary of the newly established personal services committee of the Liverpool Council of Voluntary Aid, a position she held until the Second World War. The Personal Services Society (PSS), as the committee was renamed in 1922, was set up by those Liverpool municipal reformers and social workers&#151;among them Eleanor Rathbone (1872&#150;1946), Elizabeth Macadam (1871&#150;1948), and F. G. D'Aeth (1875&#150;1940)&#151;who saw the need for a new society to carry on the work of &#145;friendly visiting&#146;, which had been pioneered by the settlement houses and expanded during the First World War. The first years of the society were, however, rocky ones. Many of the established philanthropic societies in Liverpool saw no need for another organization, especially one determined to dispense advice but not material aid, while Keeling's weak health and subsequent leave delayed the society's effective operation for almost a year.<br>
<br>Over time, however, the PSS did establish itself as the premier social work organization in Liverpool. Although Keeling herself seems to have been somewhat shy and personally timid (she admitted in her autobiography that she had never been &#145;quite brave enough&#146; to live among the poor), she guided the society with some skill for almost two decades. Organized on a ward basis and enrolling voluntary workers responsible individually for only a small number of families, the society proved flexible enough to develop innovative responses to new social needs. Thus, while the society did establish clothing clubs, boot clubs, a loan fund, and other schemes intended to ease the effects of the chronic poverty and unemployment of the inter-war years, and from 1932 administered aid on behalf of the very philanthropic society (the Central Relief Society) which had initially opposed its creation, it also inaugurated many other services, establishing advice bureaux for tenants on new housing estates, pioneering a scheme of marriage counselling, offering legal advice in cases ranging from marital disputes to money claims, organizing holidays for &#145;tired mothers&#146; and city children, and providing various forms of care and visiting to old, ill, and disabled people. This record of work and Keeling's officially non-partisan but generally progressive leadership strengthened the society's reputation as a leader in the development of family casework and as a reliable resource for those in need of advice and aid. Thus, while the society had initially dealt largely with referrals from other statutory or voluntary bodies, by 1935 about three-quarters of the year's caseload of 9000 families had come to the society of their own accord. By the outbreak of the war, the society was providing a wide array of services, had trained many dozens of students in the methods of social work, and drew on the services of some 560 voluntary workers.<br>
<br>Keeling left Liverpool during the Second World War to work more closely with the London-based National Council of Social Service (NCSS), with which the PSS had close ties. Convinced that voluntary workers could help with many of the problems caused by the war, she expanded the number and scope of the Citizens' Advice Bureaux, which she had helped to organize under the aegis of the NCSS in 1938, and developed new council services for the elderly. Made an OBE in 1946 for her work with the Citizens' Advice Bureaux, Keeling returned to Liverpool at the end of the war, resuming both her central role in voluntary social work there and her domestic partnership with Ellinor Black, then senior lecturer in the department of social science at Liverpool University, with whom she had lived since 1926. In 1950 Black was appointed director of the Sheffield School of Social Work and Keeling left Liverpool with her, taking a position on the management committee of the Middlewood Mental Hospital and serving on the Sheffield Council of Social Service. Keeling returned to Liverpool after Black's death in 1956, and for several years remained active in social work with old and mentally handicapped people, and in the work of the Citizens' Advice Bureaux. She died on 27 March 1967 at 66 West Heath Road, Hendon, London.<br>
