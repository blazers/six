</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ramsay, Sir  Andrew Crombie</span>  (1814&#150;1891), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 31 January 1814 in Glasgow, third of the four children of William Ramsay and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crombie. His father was a manufacturing chemist and businessman associated with the dyeing industry, noted for his integrity and his scientific abilities; his mother is said to have been a woman of strong but gentle character. Ramsay was not a particularly healthy child, and he was sent to school at Saltcoats on the Ayrshire coast and then in Glasgow. However, his education was cut short by his father's death in 1827. Insufficient provision had been made for the family and his mother was forced to take in boarders, and Ramsay himself had to start work in a counting house.<br>
<br>Ramsay held a number of positions in business during a period of over ten years, not enjoying any of them. A venture in the cloth trade proved unsuccessful; but he began to develop an interest in science and literature, and met Lyon Playfair, who boarded in Ramsay's household. His scientific studies were encouraged by John Nichol (1804&#150;1859) of Glasgow University, and he became interested in geology.<br>
<br>Ramsay developed a particular interest in the geology of Arran, and spent a number of vacations on the island. In 1839 a committee was established to prepare for the British Association's meeting in Glasgow in 1840, and Ramsay compiled a geological map, and geological model, of Arran. Nichol arranged for him to lecture to the association's geological section, and to conduct a field excursion to the island. The hope that this might bring Ramsay to the attention of the leaders of the geological community was dashed when Ramsay overslept and the geologists departed to Arran without him! However, Nichol came to the rescue and Ramsay's work was published the following year as <span class="italic">The Geology of the Island of Arran</span>.<br>
<br>Despite the Arran fiasco, Ramsay's abilities had been noticed by Roderick Murchison, who invited him as travelling companion on a visit to America. By the time Ramsay arrived in London to take up this offer, Murchison's plans had changed, but he induced the geological survey's director, Henry De la Beche, to offer Ramsay a position as assistant geologist; and he started work in Pembrokeshire in April 1841. He was highly successful in this new occupation and he was promoted to local director between 1844 and 1845; in 1848 he also became geology professor at University College, London. With the establishment of the Royal School of Mines at Kensington in 1851, Ramsay resigned from University College to take up the new chair of geology. He held his two appointments concurrently until 1872, when he succeeded Murchison as director general of the survey. This position Ramsay held until his retirement in 1881.<br>
<br>Ramsay's most important fieldwork was undertaken in Wales in the years 1848&#150;51. There the surveyors' systematic work provided empirical information that eventually helped close the bitter controversy between Murchison and the Cambridge professor, Adam Sedgwick, concerning the Cambrian&#150;Silurian boundary. Besides having responsibility for the mapwork, Ramsay was responsible for the geological sections of Wales. They had considerable aesthetic appeal as well as scientific significance. Yet Ramsay proposed a rather bizarre geological hypothesis, that certain major igneous masses near Bangor were responsible for metamorphosing not only the adjacent mainland rocks, but those of Anglesey too. So the island's gnarled rocks were construed by Ramsay as metamorphosed Cambrian, not Precambrian. This was in keeping with a view held for some years within the survey that Precambrian rocks were found in Britain only in the gneisses of north-west Scotland. In addition to the geological maps and sections of Wales, Ramsay produced a major survey memoir: <span class="italic">The Geology of North Wales</span> (1866; 2nd edn, 1881).<br>
<br>During his work in Anglesey, Ramsay stayed for a few days in 1850 at the home of James Williams, rector of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy, whose daughter Louisa he married on 20 July 1852. They took their honeymoon in Europe, enabling Ramsay to see glaciers and glacial phenomena at first hand, as well as the contorted alpine rocks. He had previously been interested in geomorphology, especially with regard to the erosive powers of rivers and the development of river systems, on which topic he had published an important memoir (<span class="italic">On the Denudation of South Wales and the Adjacent Counties of England</span>) in 1846. Now, with his new alpine experiences, he developed a keen interest in glacial phenomena, and became one of the field's leading authorities.<br>
<br>Lakes had long troubled proponents of the origin of valleys by river action; and although the glacial theory of Louis Agassiz (which had been presented to the British Association in Glasgow in 1840) accounted for many surface phenomena observable in northern lands, the origin of lakes was still problematic. Could glaciers &#145;scoop&#146; the hollows now occupied by lakes? In 1862 Ramsay presented his view to the Geological Society that glaciers could indeed hollow out lake-basins, without requiring earth movements to produce areas of weakness. His paper was controversial and led to numerous discussions over several decades. Ramsay's view eventually prevailed, though it is thought that earth movements may indeed play a part in basin formation. Ramsay also proposed (in 1854) that glacial conditions had existed in the Permian era, as well as in the geologically recent Pleistocene; and subsequently he contemplated other Palaeozoic glaciations. Initially, these ideas were coolly received, but in the light of the astronomical theory of James Croll, the hypothesis gathered strength, though it was not fully accepted in Ramsay's lifetime.<br>
<br>Following De la Beche's death in 1855, Ramsay might have hoped to assume the survey directorship, but the position went to Murchison, and it was only on his demise in 1872 that Ramsay succeeded to the leadership. Already in somewhat failing health, he was unable to achieve as much as director-general as he and his colleagues might have expected, and the affairs of the survey languished somewhat under Ramsay's leadership. He had had a serious breakdown in health in 1860, from which he only partly recovered. In 1878 his left eye was surgically removed following a severe infection. With such afflictions, he found that his administrative duties weighed upon him, and it was only with a struggle that he finished the second edition of his Welsh memoir.<br>
<br>In 1863 Ramsay published his <span class="italic">Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain</span>, which reached its fifth edition in 1878. This book originated in six lectures for working men given at the School of Mines Museum, but it was developed and enlarged to become one of the standard nineteenth-century geological texts. By all accounts, Ramsay was an excellent lecturer, though he had to receive assistance in his lecturing work in his declining years.<br>
<br>As president of the Geological Society in 1863&#150;4 Ramsay gave influential addresses on the problem of breaks in the stratigraphic record, arguing in terms of Charles Lyell's theory that such breaks might be attributed to the occurrence of continental conditions, for the existence of which Ramsay offered empirical evidence. For his presidential address to the British Association in 1880 he lectured &#145;On the recurrence of certain phenomena in geological time&#146;, which involved a wide survey of geological theory, seen through the lens of his uniformitarian beliefs. Ramsay claimed, for example, that metamorphism could occur at any geological epoch&#151;contrary to a view held on the continent that certain rock types were associated with particular geological epochs.<br>
<br>Ramsay was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1844, and received its Wollaston medal in 1871. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1862 and received a royal medal in 1880. He received the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Neill prize in 1866. He was awarded an LLD by the University of Edinburgh in the same year, and by Glasgow University in 1880. He presided over the geological section of the British Association in 1856, 1866, and 1881, and was association president in 1880. Ramsay received the Italian award of the Cross of St Maurice and St Lazare in 1862, and was knighted shortly before his retirement in 1881.<br>
<br>Ramsay was a considerable traveller, visiting the continent several times, and North America in 1857. He was an active climber, admirable lecturer, lucid writer, and jovial raconteur. He was a devout Christian, but readily accepted the ideas of Darwin and Lyell. However, while an outstanding field geologist, Ramsay was somewhat unsympathetic towards laboratory studies and is recorded as saying that he didn't believe in looking at a mountain with a microscope. Sir Andrew and Lady Ramsay retired to Beaumaris in Anglesey but the geologist's old age was dogged by ill health. He died at his home in Beaumaris, 7 Victoria Terrace, on 9 December 1891, survived by his wife, four daughters, and a son; he was buried at Llansadwrn.<br>
