<span class="headword">Herbert, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1793&#150;1861), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of Richard Townsand Herbert of Cahirnane, co. Kerry (MP for County Kerry, 1783&#150;90), and his second wife, Jane, daughter of Anthony Stoughton of Ballyhorgan, was born at Cahirnane in February 1793, &#145;a collateral member of the noble house of Pembroke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1861). In July 1803 he entered the navy on the <i>Excellent</i> with Captain Sotheron, in which he went out to the Mediterranean, and was present at the operations on the coast of Italy and in the Bay of Naples in 1806. He was afterwards moved into the frigate <i>Blonde</i> with Captain Volant Vashon Ballard. In her he was present, in December 1807, at the capture of the Danish West Indian islands, and on Ballard's recommendation was made lieutenant by Sir Alexander Cochrane on 1 August 1809 (confirmed by the Admiralty on 10 October). For the following four years he was lieutenant of the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> with Sir James Athol Wood on the West Indian, home, and Mediterranean stations; and in 1814 was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Euryalus</i>, with Captain Charles Napier, and took part in the operations in the Potomac, after which he was promoted commander on 19 October 1814.<br>
<br>In September 1821 Herbert commissioned the <i>Icarus</i> for the West Indies, where in the following May he was transferred to the <i>Carnation</i> (18 guns), and on 25 November 1822 was posted to the <i>Tamar</i> (26 guns). After destroying three pirate vessels on the coasts of Cuba and Yucat&aacute;n, she was brought home by him and paid off in August 1823. In 1829 he was high sheriff for co. Kerry.<br>
<br>Herbert had no further naval service until November 1837, when he was appointed to the frigate <i>Calliope</i> (26 guns), and was sent to the coast of Brazil. After acting as senior officer there and at the River Plate, in January 1840 he was ordered round to Valpara&iacute;so, and thence on to China which he reached in October. For a couple of months, pending the arrival of Rear-Admiral George Elliot, he was senior officer in the Canton River, and after the admiral's arrival had command of the operations against Chuenpe (Chuanbi) and the Bogue (Humen) Forts, in the steamer <i>Nemesis</i>, opening a way through creeks behind Anunghoy (Yaniangxie), and destroying a twenty-gun battery which guarded the rear of that island. Continuing in command of the advanced squadron he captured the fort in Whampoa (Huangpu) reach, and silenced the batteries commanding the approach to Canton. In June and July he was again senior officer in the Canton River, and on the arrival of Sir William Parker he was moved into the <i>Blenheim</i> (72 guns), in which he played a distinguished part in the capture of Amoy (Xiamen) and Chusan (Zhoushan), and commanded the naval brigade at the capture of Chinghae (Qinghai). He was made a CB on 29 January, and a KCB on 14 October 1841; peace having been concluded at Nanking (Nanjing) in October 1842, he returned to England in the <i>Blenheim</i> which he paid off in March 1843.<br>
<br>From 1847 to 1849 Herbert was commodore on the east coast of South America, with a broad pennant in the <i>Raleigh</i> (50 guns). From February to December 1852 he was a junior lord of the Admiralty under the duke of Northumberland, and on 26 October 1852 he became a rear-admiral. From July 1852 to 1857 he was MP for Dartmouth: a Conservative, he opposed &#145;any further concession to the Roman Catholics&#146;  (<span class="italic">DrodPC</span>, 1857). He died at his home, Cadogan Place, Chelsea, London, on 4 August 1861.<br>
