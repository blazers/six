<span class="headword">Croueste <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Crowhurst]</span>,  Edwin</span>  (1841&#150;1914), <span class="occ">clown and circus proprietor</span>, was the son of Alexander Crowhurst, a shoemaker, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Finch, and was born at Bromley, Kent, on 23 May 1841. His first visit to the circus was in 1851, when he saw Batty's circus performing during the Great Exhibition. On leaving school he worked for two years at a shop in the Minories, London, but, always keen on tumbling and clowning, in 1857 he joined a circus at Stratford as a clown. His brother, Harry (<i>d</i>. 1891), had been a clown for some time, and Edwin had seen many travelling companies; he had also visited Astley's where &#145;The Battle of Waterloo&#146;, with Edward Gomersal as Napoleon and the ringmaster John Widdicombe as Wellington, made a particular impression on him. He appeared with John Clark's circus at Lambeth Baths for the winter season of 1857&#150;8, and in 1858 joined Harry Croueste's circus in Vauxhall Gardens for what proved to be its last year.<br>
<br>One of the best-known circus clowns of his day, Edwin Croueste visited many continental cities, America, and the colonies. In 1863 he took part in a race along the Thames between three clowns drawn in tubs by geese, a variant of Dickie Usher's stunt. In 1879 he was advertised as &#145;England's Greatest Shakespearian Jester, Acknowledged the Biggest Draw in the Profession&#146;, and gave a permanent address in Leicester. He then went into business for himself, and by the late 1880s Edwin Croueste's Grand circus seems to have become well established: in the 1890s it was based in Scarborough and made regular visits to Dewsbury, Halifax, Leicester, and Bradford. In 1891 Croueste opened an iron circus in Dewsbury, which in 1894 he converted to the Empire Variety Theatre.<br>
<br>Croueste had a son, George John Coney Croueste, an equestrian performer, but he died in 1881 at the age of eighteen. Croueste's nephew George, known as the &#145;English Hernandez&#146;, was famous in the late 1870s as a clever pirouette and somersault rider, and later became equestrian director in his uncle's circus. Prosperous for many years, Edwin Croueste lost his money later in life, and died in the workhouse hospital at Horton, Bradford, on 25 April 1914.<br>
