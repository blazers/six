<span class="headword">Turner,  Hugh Thackeray</span>  (1853&#150;1937), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 8 March 1853 at Foxearth, near Sudbury, Essex, the fourth of the nine children of the Revd John Richard Turner (1825&#150;1908) and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kebbell. His was a peripatetic childhood, as his father moved through a series of livings in Essex, Lincolnshire, and Wiltshire. It was also an artistic upbringing. One brother, Laurence (1864&#150;1957), became an important arts and crafts carver while another, Hawes (1851&#150;1939), was keeper of the National Gallery, London, between 1898 and 1914. Hugh Thackeray Turner was educated at Newbury grammar school and entered the office of the architect George Gilbert Scott as a pupil in 1874.<br>
<br>Scott's was the largest and most influential architectural practice of the mid-Victorian era. By the time Turner arrived, however, fashions were changing. Scott's work had come to be regarded with suspicion by the most avant garde. It was from his experience with Scott, wrote one obituarist, that Turner &#145;learned much to be avoided and he acquired an almost instinctive revulsion from &#147;the Gothic revival&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 10 Jan 1938, 258). In 1877 Turner began work on his own account, entering&#151;and losing&#151;a number of architectural competitions. He was also employed by Scott's sons, John Oldrid and George Gilbert junior, and in the following year he became the latter's chief assistant. The younger George Gilbert Scott was a brilliant but troubled man, his career damaged by his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1880, and destroyed by his collapse into insanity and alcoholism three years later.<br>
<br>By 1883, however, Turner had found a way out of Scott's office. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, founded by William Morris in 1877, needed a competent secretary&#151;someone who could be trusted to investigate buildings at risk from insensitive restoration, who could inspect and report on them, and agitate for their preservation. Approached by J. H. Middleton, another graduate of Scott's office, Turner did not hesitate: &#145;I consider this new work ought to be a grand thing for me&#146;, he wrote on 30 December 1882  (Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, archives).<br>
<br>The post did not bring with it a large salary. Employed for three days a week, Turner received &pound;120 a year (a sum that was never increased), as well as expenses and a second-class rail fare for any travelling required. To some extent this job also limited his career as an architect since the society forbade him from becoming professionally involved in any of the buildings he investigated. The work was also time-consuming. Each year, Turner had to deal with about 250 cases, about a third of which required further investigation. He travelled the country, wrote thousands of letters, and became a familiar name in the correspondence columns of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Indeed, his attacks on the work of individual architects must have alienated him from much of the profession, for&#151;as an admirer put it&#151;he was &#145;born with a liking for controversy and hard-hitting argument&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Dec 1937, 18).<br>
<br>Even though the secretaryship was ill-paid, arduous, and sometimes controversial, it was none the less rewarding. Through the society Turner became a friend of Philip Webb, who advised him on architectural design. He also encountered Eustace Balfour (1854&#150;1911), brother of the Conservative politician A. J. Balfour, and entered into partnership with him in 1885, beginning work on Ampton Hall in Suffolk (1885&#150;9). Five years later Eustace Balfour, who was married to the niece of the first duke of Westminster, became surveyor to the Grosvenor estate. Balfour and Turner were thus granted unrivalled access to the estate at a time of unprecedented building work; indeed, they did so much that Portugal Place was renamed Balfour Place. In addition to numerous houses, they were responsible for the church of St Anselm, Davies Street, London (1894&#150;6; dem.) and Alfred Beit's Park Lane mansion, Alford House (1894&#150;7; dem.). In nearby Kensington they also built the fashionable Campden House Chambers (1894). Although nominally the junior partner, Turner took the leading role in design.<br>
<br>Among others in the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings whom Turner befriended were members of the wealthy and artistic Powell family. Thomas Wilde Powell (1818&#150;1897) was a successful stockbroker, art collector, and philanthropist. He and his daughters, who included the artist Christiana Jane Herringham, first invited Turner to visit them in 1883. On 19 July 1888 Turner married T. W. Powell's younger daughter, Mary Elizabeth (May) Powell (1854&#150;1907), at St Nicolas's Church, Guildford. May became a leading member of the arts and crafts movement in her own right, exhibiting needlework and founding the Women's Guild of Arts with May Morris. The couple had three daughters, the second of whom, (Christiana) Ruth, married the mountaineer George Mallory in July 1914. Thomas Powell also employed Turner to build the progressive and picturesque Wycliffe Buildings (1894) in Guildford.<br>
<br>Despite his family responsibilities and his other work, Turner remained secretary of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings for twenty-eight years. If William Morris provided the impetus and Philip Webb the inspiration, then it was Turner who put their ideology of architectural preservation into practice. Believing buildings to be unmediated expressions of the societies by which they were erected, he was unflinching in his determination to prevent any change that would undermine their authenticity. He was equally keen to preserve national monuments like Winchester Cathedral and such local curiosities as the Godalming Pepperpot, or old town hall. Though he was not always successful in opposing restoration work, it was no exaggeration to say that &#145;There can hardly be a district in England which does not owe some part of its architectural interest to his energy and skill&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Dec 1937, 18). His <span class="italic">Notes on the Repair of Ancient Buildings</span> (1903), which combined high-flown rhetoric with practical advice, was to be even more influential, not least in its insistence that any additions to old buildings should be &#145;frankly modern&#146;  (p. 17)&#151;an idea, and a phrase, that remained current a century later.<br>
<br>In 1898 Turner designed his own home and, as befitted the abode of a member of the Art-Workers' Guild, Westbrook in Godalming was an archetypally arts and crafts house [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96545', "founders of the Art-Workers' Guild")</script>]. With Gertrude Jekyll's assistance, he surrounded it with a much admired garden. There he was to live for the rest of his life, becoming a leading figure in local society. His wife died early in 1907, followed by both his partner and his chief assistant in 1911. Turner resigned as secretary to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in the same year, though he continued his association with it&#151;even standing in as unpaid secretary during the First World War. He also continued to design buildings, not least the Phillips Memorial Cloister in Godalming (1913). Increasingly, however, the attractions of home and the loss of his closest associates meant that he withdrew from public life. After a long retirement he died of pyelonephritis on 11 December 1937 at 20 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, London.<br>
<br>Hugh Thackeray Turner was a striking individual, who invariably wore a bright blue tie to match his eyes. He was a gifted amateur musician and ceramic painter. Although an interesting architect in his own right, it is for his influence on other architects' work that he is best remembered. His energy, determination, and willingness to court controversy helped bring about a permanent change in the treatment of ancient buildings.<br>
