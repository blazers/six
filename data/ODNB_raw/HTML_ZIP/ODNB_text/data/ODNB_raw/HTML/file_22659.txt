<span class="headword">Powell,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1609&#150;1642), <span class="occ">lawyer and legal writer</span>, styled himself, in 1634, an attorney of Wells (Somerset) who had been practising for twenty-five years and who was also a member of New Inn, one of the inns of chancery in London. But apart from what can be learned from his published works little is known about his education or life.<br>
<br>Powell published three short books, a feat that was unusual, but not unique, among members of his branch of the legal profession at the time. Composed in the early to mid-1630s they combine the perspective of a country lawyer, sometimes aiming at a &#145;vulgar&#146; audience, with a more metropolitan interest in pre-conquest British history and conceptions of the state. Inspired by the work of Sir Thomas Skene, Powell frequently quoted Bracton, parliamentary statutes, and the popular classical authors Cicero and Seneca, as well as more recent historians including Camden and Bacon. He did not often refer to court records or law reports, but his first book, <span class="italic">The Life of Alfred</span> (1634), combined a narrative based on Asser's contemporary works with an appreciation of Anglo-Saxon laws as translated by the Elizabethan William Lambarde. Dedicated to Walter Curll, the bishop of Winchester, the work stresses the depredations of war while depicting Alfred as an enlightened monarch who founded University College, Oxford, and who eventually reduced the confused &#145;kingdom to the subordinate rule of orderly government&#146;  (Powell, <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, 70) by instituting national laws and dividing the country into its most ancient units of local government: shires, hundreds, and tithings. In a final section, moreover, Powell attempted to draw detailed parallels between the reign of Charles I and that of Alfred, asking in his conclusion &#145;where there are such glorious Soveraignes, would it not well become their people to be gracious subjects&#146;  (ibid., 153).<br>
<br>The next of Powell's works to be published, <span class="italic">Depopulation Arraigned, Convicted and Condemned by the Lawes of God and Man</span> (1636), which was dedicated to Attorney-General Sir John Bankes, was an unsolicited apology for the Caroline policy of issuing commissions to investigate enclosures and rural depopulation. Less interesting as a factual account of the contemporary problem than for its approach to political economy, the book pointed to historical examples from the ancient Greeks onwards of attempts by states to protect agriculture. In Powell's view, when people lost their homes and means of making a living it ultimately caused them to become &#145;aliens and strangers to their nationall government, and the kingdome by that means is in a manner dispeopled and desolated&#146;  (Powell, <span class="italic">Depopulation</span>, 7). He also argued that no claim based on the sanctity of private property rights could stand in the way of using measures such as the royal commissions to find a solution to the problem.<br>
<br>Powell's third book, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Antiquity, Authority, Uses and Jurisdiction of the Ancient Courts of Leet</span>, was composed at roughly the same time as the <span class="italic">Life of Alfred</span>, but various delays prevented it from being published until 1642. Although similar in many respects to previous treatises on leet jurisdiction Powell's historical introduction developed the importance of Alfred as a founder of legal institutions and traced the history of the leet from his time down to the present. The publication also reflects a shift in Powell's political opinions since it includes a lengthy &#145;Explanation of The old Oath of Legeance&#146;, which develops at some length the theory that the subject's duty of obedience was directly related to the sovereign's obligation to protect civil and religious liberties. Castigating the illegality of ship money Powell provided a number of historical examples of clashes between monarch and people over such issues, but his conclusion expressed the hope that King Charles's decision to call parliament would lead to a period of reform and reconciliation.<br>
