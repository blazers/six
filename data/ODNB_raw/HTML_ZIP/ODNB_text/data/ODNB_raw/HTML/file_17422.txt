<span class="headword">MacDonald,  Alexander</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1695&#150;<em>c.</em>1770), <span class="occ">Scottish Gaelic poet</span>, was born at Dalilea on the north bank of Loch Shiel; he was the second son of the Revd Alexander MacDonald 
    (Maighstir Alasdair; <i>c</i>.1655&#150;1724)
  , the episcopalian clergyman in the wide parish of Ardnamurchan, and of his wife, who was a MacLachlan from Morven. His eldest brother was Angus, and he had several sisters. His father came from South Uist; his patrilineal great-grandfather, Ranald, was a son of Allan MacDonald, chief of Clanranald, and his patrilineal great-grandmother belonged to the family of the MacDonalds of Islay. Flora MacDonald of the Jacobite rising of 1745 was the poet's first cousin. The Revd Alexander MacDonald had graduated MA from the University of Glasgow in 1674, going on to study divinity thereafter. He seems to have been settled at Dalilea not later than 1687, and probably earlier. His son Alasdair is said to have attended Glasgow University also; his father may have intended him for the ministry and the chief of Clanranald apparently wished him to follow the law. He may have served Clanranald for some time in a quasi-legal capacity, but by 1729 or a little earlier he was employed as teacher and catechist (posts funded by the general assembly of the Church of Scotland and by the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge), and he held various posts in locations from Islandfinnan to south Morven, until 1745. Shortly before the outbreak of the 'Forty-Five he seems to have officially converted to Roman Catholicism, a conversion that may have been as much political as religious. Alasdair married Jane MacDonald of Dalness; their son, Ranald [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55470/', "MacDhomnuill, Raonuill")</script>], was a folklorist. Ranald was old enough to hold the school fort for his father when Alasdair was preparing for the rising in 1744&#150;5. There were several daughters of this marriage also, the youngest born about 1746&#150;7.<br>
<br>Alasdair played a prominent part in the 'Forty-Five; he held a captain's commission, made the acquaintance of Prince Charlie soon after his landing, and acted as the prince's Gaelic tutor. A journal of the 'Forty-Five campaign was compiled by Alasdair and some prominent MacDonald relatives and friends, and this was published in <span class="italic">The Lockhart Papers</span>, while various interviews with Bishop Forbes (between December 1747 and April 1751) later appeared in <span class="italic">The Lyon in Mourning</span>. Alasdair seems to have been involved in the entire campaign, from the welcome at Glenfinnan&#151;via the battles of Prestonpans and Falkirk, the entries to Edinburgh and Glasgow, the march to Derby, and the skirmish at Clifton near Penrith&#151;to the battle of Culloden. Some references in <span class="italic">The Lockhart Papers</span> and early poems referring to the battle of Sheriffmuir suggest that he may have taken part in the Jacobite rising of 1715 also, but this cannot be verified. His surviving poetry includes many songs and poems connected with the 'Forty-Five and with the political events of 1745&#150;8. Some of these describe battles, or praise the highland clans, or propose toasts to the Stewarts, or vilify Cumberland and the anti-highland measures taken by the government after the rising. One or two also assess the situation, and its historical background, in a calm, judicious way.<br>
<br>Approximately 6000 lines survive of verse ascribed to Alasdair. It is likely that this represents only part of his total output. This verse has a wide range, as is indicated by a brief listing of topics: the origins of the Gaelic language, an address to the muses, an elegy for a pet dove, poems describing summer and winter and other poems of natural description, the idyllic &#145;Praise of Morag&#146; and the scurrilous &#145;Dispraise of Morag&#146;, a bridal song, a fierce satire of an anti-Jacobite poetess, a satire of a priest and his parish, a satire of dissolute octogenarians in Ardnamurchan, a lengthy mixture of fun and satire directed at a catalogue of Campbells (named &#145;The Ark&#146;), and a long poem of over 560 lines on Clanranald's galley (&#145;Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill&#146;). This poetry shows Alasdair's acquaintance with the earlier traditions of Gaelic verse and saga, with classical literature to some extent, and probably with the work of earlier Scots poets such as Gavin Douglas, and with the contemporary eighteenth-century poet James Thomson, author of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>. These influences surface in various poems, but never dominate them. The poet is his own master, in terms of construction, development of theme, and felicity of language. He deploys a huge vocabulary, and continually shows inventive genius. His two seasonal poems owe something to an ancient Gaelic tradition of nature description and also to Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span>, but they also carry the clear stamp of Alasdair's own genius; a succession of eighteenth-century Gaelic poets followed him in this particular seasonal poetry track. His &#145;Praise of Morag&#146; has a delicate erotic felicity and his galley poem a detailed dramatic development, while his satires explore the language of depravity with brilliance. There is some earlier evidence of his involvement with Gaelic vocabulary, for he edited a Gaelic&#150;English vocabulary for the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in the mid-1730s. This was published in 1741 and is partly based on an existing vocabulary of English and on Edward Lhuyd's <span class="italic">Archaeologia Britannica</span> (1707). A manuscript in the special collections department of Glasgow University Library includes copies, apparently in the poet's hand, of Irish grammars, one from an English&#150;Irish dictionary published in Paris in 1732. The poet's <span class="italic">Vocabulary</span> was the first secular Gaelic book to be printed and the collection of his own poetry published in 1751 was the first printed collection of secular Gaelic verse.<br>
<br>Relatively little is known of Alasdair's later years after his last meeting with Bishop Forbes in 1751. It is known that he lived for a short period on the Isle of Canna, where he apparently composed at least part of the galley poem. Later he lived in Moidart, Knoydart, Morar, and Arisaig, apparently dying about 1770 in isolation from his family, but reciting with his final breaths some newly composed lines to two youngsters who were watching over him on his deathbed. He was buried at Arisaig. It is not known when his wife died. His son, Ranald, by 1770 was living on the Isle of Eigg, and in 1776 he published an anthology of Gaelic verse, apparently using his father's papers and including a few items of his father's verse. There has been a succession of editions of Alasdair's poetry, most of them rather uncritical. The most complete works, with an English translation, appeared in 1924; a critical edition of the &#145;Birlinn&#146; in 1933  (A. MacLeod, <span class="italic">S&agrave;r Orain, Three Gaelic Poems</span>, 1933); an important collection of his political poems in 1933  (<span class="italic">Highland Songs of the 'Forty-Five</span>, ed. J. L. Campbell, 1933; repr., 1984); and an edition of <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span>, using a wide range of sources, in 1996  (<span class="italic">Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, Selected Poems</span>, ed. D. S. Thomson).<br>
