<span class="headword">Greenwood,  (Peter) Humphry</span>  (1927&#150;1995), <span class="occ">ichthyologist</span>, was born on 21 April 1927 in Redruth, Cornwall, the only child of Percy Ashworth Greenwood (1896&#150;1963), mining engineer, and his wife, Joyce May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilton (1893&#150;1957). His father (a Lancastrian, who had met his Cornish wife while studying at the Camborne School of Mines) was at that time working in South Africa, but his mother returned to Cornwall for his birth. Greenwood attended Passmore Edwards School in Redruth (1934) but most of his early years were spent in South Africa, where he attended St John's College, Johannesburg (1934&#150;9), and Michaelhouse, Balgowan, Natal (1939&#150;41). He spent six months at the &#145;General Botha&#146; Training School of the South African naval forces (1942), and attended Krugersdorp high school, Krugersdorp from 1942 to 1944. He enlisted in the South African navy in August 1944 and served in the Indian Ocean in HMS <i>Ceylon</i>. Having been demobilized in February 1946, he entered the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in March, and obtained an honours degree in zoology in 1950. In January that year he married Marjorie George, a demonstrator in the zoology department at &#145;Wits&#146;. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>On graduating Greenwood obtained a colonial fisheries research studentship, the first seven months of which were to be under the supervision of Dr Ethelwynn Trewavas at the British Museum (natural history), London. There he began work on the haplochromine cichlid fishes of Lake Victoria that were to remain a dominant interest throughout his career. Between 500 and 1000 species of these remarkable fishes have evolved in that lake, to which all are unique. Field studies began early in 1951 at the East African Fisheries Research Organization, Jinja, Uganda, where he remained until July 1957. He returned to the museum in London on a civil service commission fellowship before becoming a member of staff, and remained there until his retirement in 1989 with the rank of deputy chief scientific officer; subsequently he became a visiting research fellow.<br>
<br>When Greenwood began to study the haplochromine cichlids of Lake Victoria, some sixty species were already known, but the real wealth of species was unsuspected. One objective was to discover, describe, and name the entire fauna. This proved to be a major undertaking, beyond the capabilities of a single individual. Nevertheless Greenwood made substantial progress and set new standards in the descriptions of the fifty or so new species that he discovered. This, and the painstaking re-description of previously described species, laid the foundations for an understanding of the relationships of these fishes one with another, and of how they might have evolved. His descriptions, republished as a collected volume in 1981, <span class="italic">The Haplochromine Fishes of the East African Lakes</span>, stand as a monument to his skill, industry, and patience.<br>
<br>Of wider interest was Greenwood's attempt in 1974 to explain the biology and evolution of this remarkable species flock. He concluded that it was monophyletic: that is, its constituents were derived from a single ancestral species. However, as a result of applying rigorous aspects of that method of classification and the recognition of affinities known as cladistics, he later became dissatisfied with this conclusion, and in 1980 he repudiated it. For technical reasons this was a mistake, and when the development of molecular methods enabled an independent approach to be made, this showed that his original conclusion was correct. Although it has been said that the problems he &#145;was unable to settle after thirty years of morphology are now more likely to be resolved in a few months by a graduate student and a sequencer&#146;  (Patterson, 207) this overlooks the fact that, without his groundwork, such an approach would be impossible as the species involved could not even be identified. Furthermore such investigations tell one nothing about the structure and habits of these fishes, an understanding of these being necessary before meaningful evolutionary changes can be deduced. Here Greenwood's morphological work was of permanent value. However, the discovery of further species led to taxonomic problems that proved contentious, and the extermination of many of these fishes by the introduced Nile perch and other destructive human interference with the lake inevitably caused these studies to end on a note of disappointment.<br>
<br>Greenwood's other published African work embraced descriptions of new fishes, the breeding habits of a catfish and a lungfish, various matters relating to both living and fossil fishes, and a semi-popular book on the fishes of Uganda. For several years in the 1960s and 1970s he was chairman of a team that studied the productivity of Lake George, Uganda. He also made substantial contributions to the higher level systematics of teleost (modern bony) fishes. Particularly significant was a paper with D. E. Rosen, S. H. Weitzman, and G. S. Myers, published in the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History</span> in 1966, that proposed a classification fundamentally different from its predecessors in certain respects. Other work included studies on the Weberian apparatus, skulls, swim bladder, hyoid and gill-arch musculature, and on the interrelationships of various groups. He also took an interest in marine coelacanths.<br>
<br>Greenwood had an impish sense of humour, reflected in his physiognomy; he was an excellent mimic, and always an entertaining companion. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1985, and received the scientific medal of the Zoological Society of London (1963), the Linnaeus medal of the Linnean Society of Sweden (1978), and the Linnean medal of the Linnean Society of London (1982), having been president of the last-named society from 1976 to 1979. He became a foreign member (class VII) of the Swedish Royal Academy of Science in 1984.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from the British Museum in 1989, Greenwood returned to South Africa, where he had been an honorary research associate at the J. L. B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology, Rhodes University, since 1977, and lived in Grahamstown. On a brief stopover in London, <i>en route</i> for the University of Bergen, Norway, to teach a course in fish anatomy, he collapsed from a stroke in the museum in which he formerly worked. He died two days later, on 3 March 1995, at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, and he was cremated at Putney Vale. He was survived by his wife, from whom he separated about 1989, and four daughters. A celebration of his life was held at the Linnean Society of London on 21 April 1995.<br>
