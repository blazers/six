<span class="headword">Porteous,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1695&#150;1736), <span class="occ">army officer and victim of crowd violence</span>, was probably born in the burgh of the Canongate, Edinburgh, the son of Stephen Porteous, a tailor. Little is known of his early life other than that he served in the army in Flanders. On his return to Edinburgh he was appointed in 1716 as a part-time drill master to the Edinburgh trained bands and then, in 1718, an ensign to the city guard, becoming captain in 1726. Porteous seems to have been an overbearing and unpopular figure, hated by &#145;the mob&#146;, the lowest level of Edinburgh's highly stratified society. He and they frequently clashed, and it is for the last and most serious of these encounters that he is known.<br>
<br>On 14 April 1736 a condemned smuggler, Andrew Wilson, was taken to be executed in the Grassmarket. After Wilson was hanged, perhaps because of concern about a possible rescue, Porteous asked, but was denied, permission to cut the body down early. A few minutes later when the hangman tried to remove Wilson's body, the crowd began to stone the city guard and, in the confusion, the corpse was cut down and rushed off with a view to attempted resuscitation.<br>
<br>What happened next is disputed. Porteous said he tried to restrain the guard as they withdrew under attack from a hostile crowd. But unknown guardsmen fired into the crowd, killing six protesters. Porteous maintained that the guard had acted in self-defence. Many witnesses told a different story, however. It was reported that Porteous had waved his musket threateningly at the crowd and had fired on them at point-blank range, killing the first victim. Porteous had then ordered his men to fire which they did, but over the crowd's heads, resulting in injuries to spectators at the high tenement windows. He had then ordered them to fire into the crowd, and two more victims were killed. As the crowd retreated in some panic, the guard had withdrawn towards the West Bow before, on Porteous's order, turning back to face the crowd. A third order to fire had then been heard and three more members of the crowd were killed. The guard had then completed its march up the West Bow.<br>
<br>Porteous was arrested that afternoon, disarmed, and charged with murder. His trial was held on 5 July 1736 before Andrew Fletcher, the lord justice clerk, the senior criminal judge in Scotland. Nineteen prosecution witnesses swore that Porteous had fired into the crowd on 14 April. Sixteen defence witnesses were less certain, but all stated that they had not seen him fire. The jury duly and unanimously found Porteous guilty of murder. To the satisfaction of many of the city's residents, he was sentenced to be executed in the Grassmarket on 8 September 1736 and secured in the Tolbooth prison, close to St Giles. Porteous's sentence caused alarm in government circles. The earl of Ilay, Sir Robert Walpole's manager in Scotland, made a grave miscalculation when he sought to appease his political masters with little consideration as to the depth of feeling in Scotland. An appeal was petitioned for on behalf of Porteous and an order for a deferment of six weeks arrived in Edinburgh on 2 September.<br>
<br>Rumours of a plot to murder Porteous began almost immediately. In early September Robert Lind, now captain of the city guard, had reported his concerns to Provost Wilson, and plans were made for the number of guardsmen at the Tolbooth to be increased on 8 September. There were thus only fifteen unarmed guards on duty on the evening of 7 September. At about 9 p.m. a crowd began to gather in the Portsburgh, west of the Grassmarket. Apparently well organized and about 4000 strong, the crowd entered the city through the West Port which they immediately secured. They crossed the Grassmarket to the Cowgate where they secured both the Cowgate and Netherbow ports, cutting the city off from the regular troops at Holyrood. The crowd then made its way up the High Street and overpowered the guards. The civic authorities were paralysed as the crowd began to attack the Tolbooth. Troops stationed at the castle were prevented from gaining access by the crowd which stood between them and the magistrates. Eventually the city's MP and former lord provost Robert Lindsay went to General Moyle at Holyrood for military assistance. Critically, however, he did not take a warrant with him and Moyle refused his request. The Tolbooth withstood the crowd's assault until about 11.30 p.m. when Porteous was dragged from the prison, up the Lawnmarket towards the castle, and then down the steep West Bow towards the Grassmarket. Someone broke into a shop on the way and left a guinea for a rope to hang their victim. In the Grassmarket Porteous was quickly strung up on a dyer's pole as a makeshift gallows. After a few minutes he was dragged down and his nightshirt was wrapped around his head. Stringing him up for a second time, the crowd forgot to tie his hands and, as he struggled to prevent his own strangulation, they broke his arm and shoulder. Porteous was brought down from the pole a third time, badly beaten, before being hauled up again. He died shortly before midnight on the very eve of the date set for his judicial execution. He was buried in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh, on 8 September 1736.<br>
<br>Porteous's murder deepened the sense of alarm in London. Numerous theories existed to explain what was variously characterized as a Jacobite plot, an extreme Presbyterian conspiracy, or revenge by smugglers, a wild drunken rabble, or friends of those killed on 14 April. It is quite likely that elements of all these were present in the 4000-strong crowd. The planning and organization, however, seems to have been the work of a small group of Edinburgh tradesmen and journeymen, led by James Maxwell, a journeyman carpenter, who gave detailed and damning evidence against Porteous at his trial and who absconded from the city after the riot, along with about seventy other tradesmen, journeymen, and apprentices. The despised &#145;mob&#146; had had its revenge on an overbearing official.<br>
<br>Of more serious concern to the government was the threat presented to the management of Scotland. Walpole, the duke of Newcastle, Ilay, and Queen Caroline felt that the magistrates had sacrificed Porteous rather than risk the fury of the crowd. General Moyle and the lord justice clerk likewise believed that the magistrates had been party to the conspiracy. Opposition peers seized their opportunity and brought in a bill to imprison Provost Wilson, debar him from office, disband the city guard, and pull down the Netherbow Port. The government argued that the proposals were excessive, infringed the liberties of the city and the Scottish legal system, and were a slur on Scottish loyalty to the Union.<br>
<br>In the Commons, the Scottish MPs were similarly critical of the bill and would not be placated. The opposition was forced to alter its demands. Accepting that the bill could indeed be interpreted as an attack on liberties and a threat to the constitution, they secured the disqualification of the lord provost and the imposition of a &pound;2000 fine on the city for the benefit of Porteous's widow, details of whom are unknown. Walpole's government made one further miscalculation in the aftermath of the Porteous affair. In pursuit of Porteous's murderers an act was passed offering a reward of &pound;200 for evidence. Unfortunately, the act required that it be read in churches on the first Sunday of every month for a year. A large and increasing number of ministers refused, regarding acquiescence as Erastian heresy. Amid an explosion of pamphlets on the subject, Walpole withdrew the measure. No further information about Porteous's killers was ever uncovered. The Porteous riots, as they came to be called, form the opening scene of Sir Walter Scott's novel <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span> (1818).<br>
