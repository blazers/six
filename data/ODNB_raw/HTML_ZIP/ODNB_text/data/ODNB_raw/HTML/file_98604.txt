<span class="headword">Morley,  Sheridan Robert <span class="st"> [Sherry]</span></span>  (1941&#150;2007), <span class="occ">theatre critic and biographer</span>, was born on 5 December 1941 at Five Trees nursing home, overlooking Ascot racecourse, Berkshire, the elder son of the actor, writer, and producer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40477/', "Robert Adolph Wilton Morley (1908&#150;1992)")</script>, and his wife, the actress Joan North, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buckmaster (1910&#150;2005), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30964/', "Dame Gladys Cooper")</script>. His birth coincided with the first night in London of <span class="italic">The Man Who Came to Dinner</span>, in which his father was playing the outrageous Sheridan Whiteside, after whom he was named.<br>
<br>As a child of the theatre, with which he fell deeply in love at a very early age, Morley was never going to enjoy a traditional English childhood. His formal education began at Rupert House preparatory school in Henley-on-Thames. &#145;Hopeless at art and handiwork&#146;, read his autumn term report in 1947. &#145;Avoids sport whenever possible &hellip; Imitates teachers well. Totally unable to catch or throw balls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Asking for Trouble</span>, 42). The following year he left for America with his mother and younger sister, Annabel. They stayed first with Gladys Cooper in California. After a year in New York, where his father's hugely successful play <span class="italic">Edward, My Son</span> was playing on Broadway, and an eighteen-month tour of Australia and New Zealand, the family returned to England and his father set about finding a suitable school for him. To this end he inserted an advertisement in the personal column of <span class="italic">The Times</span>: &#145;Father with horrible memories of his own schooldays at Wellington is searching for a school for his son where the food matters as much as education, and the standards are those of a good three-star seaside hotel&#146;  (ibid., 81). A number of headmasters were interviewed, and the job finally went to a Dutchman called Harry Tuyn who ran Sizewell Hall, an eccentric school on the Suffolk coast near Aldeburgh where the forty or so children decided what they wanted to learn. The star-struck teenager spent his school holidays wherever his father happened to be filming&#151;most memorably in Ravello with Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida shooting John Huston's <span class="italic">Beat the Devil</span>.<br>
<br>Given that Sizewell was not an ideal preparation for anything else&#151;&#145;more of a total once-in-a-lifetime experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Asking for Trouble</span>, 84)&#151;it says a lot for Morley's determination that he managed to gain a place at Merton College, Oxford, in 1960 to read French. An immediately recognizable figure in Oxford, large, exuberant, with an enormous gift for friendship, for three years he roamed the theatrical and journalistic landscape, cultivating his many skills&#151;as a trenchant critic for <span class="italic">Isis</span>, assistant producer to Peter Dews who came to direct <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, parts 1 and 2, at the Playhouse, secretary of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, and, given half a chance, actor. But he always knew that, however else he might emulate his father, it would not be on the stage.<br>
<br>Morley graduated with a third-class degree in 1963 and, having landed a job with ITN, first enjoyed a year in the drama department of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, where he met Margaret Gudejko from Boston, who in 1965 became his first wife and with whom he had three children. Meanwhile, in the autumn of 1964 he took up his job at ITN as a newscaster, reporter, and scriptwriter. Three years later he moved to the BBC where he spent four happy years on the pioneering, open-ended discussion programme <span class="italic">Late Night Line-Up</span> alongside Joan Bakewell, Denis Tuohy, Michael Dean, and Tony Bilbow.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Morley yearned to be a drama critic and began to realize his ambition when <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s revered arts editor John Lawrence employed him as third-string reviewer. When John Higgins took over from Lawrence he commissioned Morley to write a series of profiles, &#145;Great Exiles&#146;. One of his first subjects was No&euml;l Coward, who not only agreed to be godfather to Morley's son Hugo, but also that Morley should be his first biographer. The publication of <span class="italic">A Talent to Amuse</span> in 1969 coincided with Coward's seventieth birthday celebrations and launched Morley on a long and distinguished career as an author of theatrical biographies. His next subject&#151;while still working as monthly reviewer for <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> and London drama critic of the <span class="italic">International Herald Tribune</span>&#151;was Oscar Wilde (1976), chosen not least because his father had been the first actor to play him on stage and screen. Ever since childhood Morley had been susceptible to star quality, and his books reflected his passion. A biography of Sybil Thorndike (1977) was followed by <span class="italic">Marlene Dietrich</span> (1977), which concentrated on her hitherto unchronicled post-war stage life.<br>
<br>For the next thirty years Morley juggled drama criticism, journalism, television and radio broadcasts, and book writing. In 1973 he joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as deputy features editor under Margaret Allen, and in 1975 he moved to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, where he was at his happiest for the next fourteen years as arts editor and drama critic under the editorships of William Davis and Alan Coren. It was a matter of great pride to him that he and Robert Morley were the only father and son to have been made members of the <span class="italic">Punch</span> table (other than members of the Agnew family). While at <span class="italic">Punch</span> he continued to celebrate the lives of such legendary stars as his grandmother Gladys Cooper (1979), Gertrude Lawrence (1981), Katherine Hepburn (1984), Ingrid Bergman (1985), Elizabeth Taylor (1988), and James Mason (1989). In 1983 he published <span class="italic">Tales from the Hollywood Raj</span>, a glorious account of the heyday of the British acting colony, whose denizens included Sir C. Aubrey Smith, Ronald Colman, Leslie Howard, Nigel Bruce, Basil Rathbone, the Oliviers, and David Niven, whose biography, <span class="italic">The Other Side of the Moon</span> (1985), he wrote at the request of Niven's sons after their father's death.<br>
<br>It was inevitable that, sooner or later, Morley would start writing for the stage, which he did in 1983 with <span class="italic">No&euml;l and Gertie</span>, a highly entertaining and at times touching account, compiled from their letters and diaries, of the loving friendship of No&euml;l Coward and Gertrude Lawrence. By the time of Morley's death more than fifty productions had been mounted all over the world. Other musical shows devised by Morley included <span class="italic">Spread a Little Happiness</span>, an anthology of the songs of Vivian Ellis (King's Head and Whitehall, 1992), and the <span class="italic">Jermyn Street Revue</span> (2000). He made many cabaret appearances, notably at Pizza on the Park with the nostalgic American pianist Steve Ross, and with Michael Law, with whose Piccadilly Dance Orchestra he appeared as the narrator in a programme of songs by Coward, Cole Porter, and Irving Berlin.<br>
<br>Despite bouts of depression, Morley's appetite for work was undiminished. His marriage to Margaret was dissolved in 1990. He moved from Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire, to London and in 1995 married the television producer and writer Ruth Lucille Leon, with whom he wrote four books: <span class="italic">Gene Kelly</span> (1996), <span class="italic">Marilyn Monroe</span> (1998), <span class="italic">Hey, Mr Producer: the Musicals of Cameron Mackintosh</span> (1999), and <span class="italic">Beyond the Rainbow: Judy Garland</span> (1999). When his father died in 1992 he immediately sat down and wrote an affectionate biography, <span class="italic">Robert, My Father</span> (1993). He followed this with <span class="italic">Audrey Hepburn</span> (1993), <span class="italic">Ginger Rogers</span> (1995), and, much against his subject's will, <span class="italic">Dirk Bogarde: Rank Outsider</span> (1996). Meanwhile, to his great and lasting sadness, <span class="italic">Punch</span>, as he knew and loved it, was dying on its feet and in 1990 he joined <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, where he enjoyed ten years as its drama critic, followed by several rather less happy ones at the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. In 2001 he completed the book that stands alongside <span class="italic">A Talent to Amuse</span> as a major theatrical biography, <span class="italic">John G: the Authorised Biography of John Gielgud</span>. The following year he published his own memoirs, <span class="italic">Asking for Trouble</span>.<br>
<br>His health failing, Morley still managed to direct Vanessa and Corin Redgrave in a revival of Coward's <span class="italic">A Song at Twilight</span> (King's Head and Gielgud, 1999). In 2002 he was invited to play a corrupt judge in the BBC series <span class="italic">Judge John Deed</span>. Following a long hot day in court, he removed his robe to find printed on the label: &#145;Outsize Judge. Robert Morley. 1968&#146;. He died in his sleep of heart failure on 16 February 2007. His ashes were buried next to his parents' in the churchyard of St Mary's, Wargrave. He was survived by his wife Ruth and the three children of his first marriage, Hugo, Alexis, and Juliet.<br>
