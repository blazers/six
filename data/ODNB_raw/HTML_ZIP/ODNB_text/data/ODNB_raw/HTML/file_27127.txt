<span class="headword">Tench,  Watkin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1758, <em>d.</em> 1833), <span class="occ">marine officer and author</span>, was baptized on 10 November 1758 in the parish of St Mary on the Hill, Chester, probably the fifth of five children of Fisher Tench (<i>d</i>. 1784?) who &#145;between the years 1760 and 1770 &hellip; kept an academy for dancing, and a most respectable boarding-school&#146; in Bridge Street  (Hemingway, <span class="italic">History of Chester</span>, 1831, 33), and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1794). The range of Tench's knowledge&#151;Latin and French language and literature, English literature (especially Shakespeare and Milton), travel writing, and social theory&#151;suggests a grammar school education and a socially and culturally ambitious home life. Time spent over the border in Wales possibly influenced his subsequent interest in cross-cultural relations. One of his books is dedicated to Welsh magnate Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (1772&#150;1840), in &#145;gratitude to a family, from whom I have received the deepest obligations&#146;  (Tench, <span class="italic">First Four Years</span>, 126). These obligations may have included his commission as a second lieutenant of marines in 1776. He was promoted first lieutenant in 1778, captain in 1782, major in the army in 1794, and lieutenant-colonel in 1798.<br>
<br>Tench served in the American War of Independence from 1777 to 1783 (he was a prisoner of the French in Maryland for part of 1778). At some point in the 1780s he lived in the West Indies. On 13 May 1787 he sailed for New Holland on the convict transport <i>Charlotte</i>, arriving at Botany Bay on 7 January 1788. He left the colony on 18 December 1791, reaching Spithead on 19 June 1792. On 22 October 1792 he married Anna Maria Sargent (1766&#150;1847), daughter of Robert Sargent and his wife, Hannah Hill, of Stoke Damerel, near Plymouth. After the outbreak of war (February 1793) between Britain and revolutionary France, Tench joined the Channel Fleet. His ship, the <i>Alexander</i>, was captured on 6 November 1794 and he spent six months as a prisoner, first on French ships in Brest harbour, then in the town of Quimper in Brittany. From 1802, after further service with the Channel Fleet, he was on shore duties. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Marines in 1804, colonel in the army in 1808, colonel-commandant en second in the Royal Marines in 1809, major-general in 1811, and lieutenant-general in 1821, and from 1819 was commandant of the Plymouth division of Royal Marines. He retired in 1827 and died on 7 May 1833 at the home of his brother-in-law Daniel Little at Devonport, Devon; he was buried at Devonport.<br>
<br>Tench's first two books&#151;<span class="italic">A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay</span> (1789) and <span class="italic">An Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson</span> (1793)&#151;together provided an astute and lively narrative of the first four years of the colony of New South Wales. His third book, <span class="italic">Letters written in France to a friend in London between the month of November 1794 and the month of May 1795</span> (1796), reported on the volatile circumstances which followed the fall of Robespierre. Tench may also have had a hand in the composition of an imaginary-voyage narrative, <span class="italic">Fragmens [<i>sic</i>] du dernier voyage de La Perouse</span> (Quimper, 1797).<br>
<br>Anglican in religion and liberal whig in politics, Tench was a man of strong convictions but&#151;within gentlemanly limits&#151;an enquiring mind. &#145;Enlightened&#146; was a favourite word, and he was proud to serve a Britain defined by its limited monarchy, protestant religion, the rule of law, ideals of public service, and commercial and intellectual innovation. He wished to see these values spread, those of &#145;despotism&#146; (and &#145;democracy&#146;) resisted: &#145;had I been a Frenchman I should have struggled as hard for the Revolution of 1789, as I should have resisted with all my might that of 1792&#146;  (Tench, <span class="italic">Letters from Revolutionary France</span>, 100). His commitment to the spread of enlightened British principles was, however, matched by a feeling for the distinct strengths of other peoples and systems which frequently led him to doubt the practicability or propriety of British policy in practice. He was passionately opposed to slavery in the West Indies, conscious in certain respects of the destructive impact of colonization on the Aboriginal people of New South Wales, and keen that Britain should accept the post-Jacobin French Republic of 1795.<br>
