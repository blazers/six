<span class="headword">Painter,  William</span>  (1540?&#150;1595), <span class="occ">translator and administrator</span>, may have come from a Kentish family. Having joined the Tower of London as a gunner and clerk of the armoury, he began his translation career in 1558 with &#145;Horrible and Cruell Murder of Sultan Solyman&#146;, translated from the work of Nicolas Moffan, which appears as novel 34 in volume 2 of <span class="italic">The Palace of Pleasure</span>. He became clerk of her majesty's ordnance at the Tower of London on a wage of 8<i>d</i>. a day on 9 February 1560, and moved to an address near the Tower. As he was in charge of the day-to-day administration of the ordnance, Painter had considerable scope to increase his somewhat inadequate salary by creative management of the funds under his control. About 1565 he married Dorothy Bonham (1537?&#150;1617) of Cowling. They had at least three sons, including Anthony, and four daughters. At about this time Painter bought the manors of Twedale and East Court at Gillingham, near Chatham. His official income was handsomely supplemented on 24 July 1566 by Edward Randolph, lieutenant-general of the ordnance, who assigned to &#145;William Painter, Clerk of the Ordnance, Richard Webb, Master Gunner of England, and Edward Partridge, Keeper of the Queen's Harquebutts, certain annuities and pensions&#146;  (Painter, 1890, 1.lvi).<br>
<br>The printer William Jones entered Painter's &#145;Cytie of civelitie&#146; on the Stationers' register in 1562 but it was never published. In 1566 Jones published the first volume of Painter's <span class="italic">Palace of Pleasure</span>, whose title-page promises readers a book &#145;beautified, adorned and well-furnished with Pleasant Histories and excellent Novels&#146;. It was followed the next year by the second volume. The complete work was republished in two volumes in 1575 with a dedication to Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, master of the ordnance. It is a collection of anecdotes and stories translated from ancient and humanist writers for recreational reading and some moral instruction. Painter's sources range from the Greek historian Herodotus through Romans, mainly Livy and Aulus Gellius, to Italians like Matteo Bandello and Frenchmen like Fran&ccedil;ois de Belleforest. The book was widely read, imitated, and plagiarized. Roger Ascham has a long passage in <span class="italic">The Scholemaster</span> on the moral dangers such importations from Italy posed the more innocent English. Stephen Gosson, having abandoned the theatre, complains it &#145;was ransacked to furnish the playhouses of London&#146;  (Painter, 1929, 1.xviii).<br>
<br>Painter seems to have left traces in every notable Tudor playwright, who dramatized popular literature with the zeal of the modern film producer. John Webster, for instance, takes all but minor details of the plot of <span class="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</span> from Painter's version of Belleforest (<span class="italic">Palace of Pleasure</span>, 2.23). Though there are some verbal echoes of Painter in his text, in general Webster's language is influenced by Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span>. Painter was hardly ever the sole or even the main source. The primary source of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Rape of Lucrece</span> was the Marsus edition of Ovid, <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.725ff. (1550), but he coloured Ovid with Livy, 1.57&#150;8, keeping an eye on the <span class="italic">Palace of Pleasure</span> (1.2), Painter's version of the Livy story. The argument of the poem has strong echoes of Painter. Painter's &#145;Whereuppon they rode to Rome in Post&#146; is echoed by Shakespeare's &#145;They all posted to Rome&#146;; Shakespeare has Lucretia &#145;late in the night, spinning amongst her maids&#146;, where Painter writes &#145;late in the night, occupied and busie amonges her maids in the middes of her house spinning&#146;, a close translation of the Livy. The poem itself follows Ovid, with narrative touches taken from Painter  (Baldwin, 113&#150;31). There are touches of the Painter version of Livy in <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span>, <span class="smallcap">IV</span>.i. He is also supposed to be the Guil. P. G. who wrote <span class="italic">A Moorning Diti upon the Deceas of the High and Mighti Prins Henri, Earl of Arundel</span> in 1580.<br>
<br>The assiduous and skilled corruption endemic in the Elizabethan civil service exacerbated office rivalries. In 1586 John Powell, surveyor of the ordnance, formally accused Geoffrey Turville, Richard Bowland (who by now were dead), and Painter of embezzling &pound;7075. Painter falsified his accounts either by billing the treasury for full shipments but taking delivery of only a part of them, or by charging the treasury the market price for equipment he issued to other military units from his stores in the Tower. Turville was held responsible for &pound;2715 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., Bowland for &pound;2418 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., and Painter for &pound;1949 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. Painter admitted to &pound;1079 17<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., gave an accounting for &pound;795 13<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>., and ignored the shortfall of &pound;73 11<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. He &#145;humbly beseeched Her Majesty to have pitifull regard for his wife and marriageable children&#146;, and promised to repay &#145;in a reasonable time&#146;. But he was overstretched. According to the charge-sheet the value of his lands at Gillingham was &pound;413 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>., their gross annual revenue &pound;94 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>., and annual profit &pound;61 6<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. But Painter was in debt for about &pound;1200 for mortgages and the like. No action was taken against Painter and he never repaid the whole amount. This did not prevent him from laying counter-charges of corruption against Powell, who was just as vulnerable.<br>
<br>In September 1587 Powell replied by charging Painter with false accounting and Dudley with &#145;great oppressions&#146;  (Painter, 1890, 1.lv). In answer to these charges Painter's son, Anthony, whom Painter employed as his assistant, acknowledged irregularities on the part of both himself and his father and Painter admitted on 23 June 1589 that equipment recently moved from store had been sold to its end-users rather than issued to them. No action was taken against the Painters or the earl. And finally in 1591 George Hogge, clerk of deliveries, laid detailed charges relating to July and August 1575. All of them relate to goods, mainly gunpowder and bowstaves charged for but not delivered. But Painter's accusers were no more innocent than he was. He could therefore present himself as the careful steward slandered by others whom he had found out and who were jealous of his administrative abilities. Apart from saving &pound;40 a year by small economies, &#145;he yearly increases HM stores to the value of &pound;2000 by taking returns of such munitions as return from the seas unspent in HM ships, which formerly were concealed and converted to private use&#146; (BL, Lansdowne MS 75, no. 55; Painter, 1890, 1.lx&#150;lxi). Painter claimed to have saved his employers &pound;11,000 by careful accounting. Again no action was taken against him.<br>
<br>Painter died between 19 and 22 February 1595 and was buried in St Olave's, Hart Street, London. Soon after his death the steward of the Tower estimated that the Painters, father and son, had defrauded the crown of &pound;27,000. Little wonder that William's nuncupative will of 14 February 1594 is singularly uninformative about his property and the manner of dividing it among his heirs  (Painter, 1890, 1.lxiii). On 11 May 1622 James I granted Painter's grandson discharge of the residue of his grandfather's debt to the crown which by then amounted to &pound;7800.<br>
<br>In the past William Painter the translator and naval administrator has been confused with a namesake, also from Kent. This second William Painter attended St John's College, Cambridge, between 1554 and 1557, when he left without taking a degree. Never the less around 1560 he was appointed headmaster of Sevenoaks School, a position earlier held by his father. On 25 April 1560 he was ordained deacon (he is not known to have become a priest) and appointed vicar of Grain, Kent, by the bishop of London, and shortly afterwards published a translation of William Fulke's <span class="italic">Antiprognosticon</span>, an attack on astrology. He left Grain in 1563, and was probably the William Painter recorded at his death, around 1597, as having been rector of Bramfield, Hertfordshire; he left a widow named Winifred, and was buried in St Mary Aldermanbury, London.<br>
