<span class="headword">Strachan,  Archibald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Musselburgh, Edinburghshire, the son of a craftsman. His parents' names are as yet unknown, and his relative social obscurity as an officer from outside the Scottish landed class, as much as a political and religious radicalism more often found in the English New Model Army, was to mark him out as a rare figure in the Scottish army. He is first mentioned as an officer in Sir William Waller's parliamentarian army: on 1 February 1643 he held the rank of captain of dragoons. From 15 February 1643 to 25 April 1644 he served as Waller's quartermaster-general. After the battle of Lansdown (5 July 1643) he was promoted major. For his leadership in the attack on Basing House he gained Waller's praise as gallant and brave. He commanded Waller's regiment of dragoons in September 1643. He completed his assignment with Waller in April 1644, when he became a captain and later major of horse in the Plymouth garrison. In early October he attended the committee of both kingdoms as a major. On 11 November, Waller noted Strachan was at Chichester in command of a regiment of horse. Following the exclusion of Scots from the parliamentarian armies on account of the self-denying ordinance he joined the army of the solemn league and covenant. By May 1645 he had become major of Sir John Brown's horse. He fought with the regiment at Annan Moor where Brown destroyed the royalist Northern horse. He apparently continued in Scottish service until early February 1647.<br>
<br>Strachan's radical political and religious tendencies came to light in 1648. According to Robert Baillie, his early years had been reprobate, but he had reformed and taken up protestant sectarian ideas. He served as a major under Cromwell in the Preston campaign, perhaps the only Scot to oppose the engager army in England. He assisted with the negotiations between the western whiggamores and Cromwell in September 1648. He brought the news of Charles's execution to Edinburgh. His opposition to the engagement helped gain him a command in the army of the covenants. On 28 February 1649 the estates made him lieutenant-colonel of Gilbert Ker's horse regiment, and provided him with a troop of horse. On 1 March he and his men helped to suppress the mutiny of the Stirling Castle garrison. A more serious threat to the kirk party regime came when Sir Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscarden raised 1200 northern clansmen and occupied Balvenie, Banffshire. Ker, Strachan, and Robert Hackett with 120 horse dispersed the royalists, establishing the idea that a Gideonite cadre could defeat the hosts of the unrighteous. Although Lieutenant-General David Leslie wanted him removed as a &#145;sectary&#146; the Revd Mungo Law persuaded him to retain Strachan  (Wishart, 302). Strachan desired a purging of the army of malignants (former engagers and royalists). As to any threat of a revival of royalist fortunes under Montrose, the lieutenant-colonel said, &#145;If James Grahame land neir this quarters [Inverness], he will suddenly be de&#151;ed. And ther shalbe no need of the levy of knavis to the work tho they should be willing&#146;  (Gardiner, 1.213).<br>
<br>After Montrose's landing in Caithness in April 1650, Strachan fulfilled his promise. Following Lieutenant-General Leslie's orders he moved north from Tain with two troops of horse. He was joined by three more troops (for a total of 230 cavalry from Gilbert Ker's and Sir James Hackett's horse), 36 musketeers from Lawers's foot, and 400 Ross and Munro clansmen. On 27 April he headed west on the south bank of the Kyle of Sutherland, near Montrose's camp at Carbisdale. On the eve of battle Strachan exhorted his troops:<blockquote>Gentlemen, yonder are your enemies, and they are not only your enemies, they are the enemies of our Lord Jesus Christ; I have been dealing this last night with Almighty God, to know the event of this affair, and I have gotten it: as sure as God is in heaven, they are delivered into our hands and there not a man of us fall to the ground. (Nicoll, 9)</blockquote>The royalists mustered 1200 infantry (of which 450 were Danes or Germans) and forty horse. Following the advice of Andrew Munro, Strachan advanced only a troop of horse in the open, hiding the remainder of his force. As Montrose had heard of only one troop of horse in Ross-shire, he ordered his men to marshal on the open ground south of the Culrain Burn, instead of taking a position in the wooded heights behind. At 5 p.m. Strachan hit the royalists with two troops, ably seconded by his other men. Surprised, Montrose's men routed; two-thirds of them were killed, drowned, or captured. The marquess just escaped. After thanking God for the victory, Strachan headed south. He and Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Hackett each received &pound;1000 sterling and a gold chain from the Scottish parliament. Although hit by a bullet in the battle, his belt buckle and buff coat prevented a wound.<br>
<br>The commission of the general assembly favoured Strachan so much that on 3 July 1650 it ordered all ministers to provide money (100,000 merks Scots) for raising a new regiment of 550 horse under his command. On 30&#150;31 July the ministers' horse under Strachan served at the battle of Musselburgh. During the summer Strachan pushed for further purging of the army. He probably signed the radical West Kirk declaration on 15 August. In any case he, Archibald Johnston of Wariston, and Colonel Gilbert Ker held secret talks with the English. On the evening of 2 September, Strachan and Ker urged Leslie to move off Doon Hill to fight the English. On the 3rd Strachan's regiment was on the Scottish right flank. Thanks to having their front rank armed with lances, his men initially repulsed Lambert. Strachan, to his credit, fought desperately, but the regiment eventually fled and rode to Stirling.<br>
<br>Strachan now entered the final stage of his military career&#151;one that reflected ill on his patriotism. He resigned rather than continue service under Leslie. On 5 September the committee of estates commissioned Strachan and Ker to take their regiments into the western association (south-west Scotland) and raise new levies. Following English examples, the kirk party had created the western association in 1648, but it had failed to become an active force in military or fiscal affairs. The lairds and ministers of the south-west (western association) were more radical than the committee of estates politically, socially, and theologically. Now, almost immediately in 1650 it saw itself as the instrument of the godly unpolluted by malignancy. Hence its refusal to send its levies to the national army and the establishment of its own military force. The two officers in conjunction with the association raised a new army; one that placed the Scottish government and English invaders on the same level of disdain. Eventually, Strachan's horse consisted of 400 well-mounted and well-armed men, including many Dutch and Germans. Although the committee of the western association's civilian leaders disliked both Cromwell and the royalists, Strachan found the former preferable and corresponded with him. On 17 October the committee promulgated the western remonstrance in Dumfries, which called for &#145;revolution in one country&#146;, in other words it abandoned calls for presbyterianism in England and Ireland and broke the union of crowns, but called instead for a covenanted king in Scotland. Strachan refused the document, insisting the king be arrested or exiled, which would force Cromwell to leave as Scotland would have abandoned the Stuart monarchy. Although ordered from his regiment, Strachan disobeyed. In addition he and his associates (Major Govan and Scoutmaster Dundas) wrote to Cromwell. Not wishing to antagonize Ker, the committee took no action against Strachan, who eventually left his unit but remained in the area. On 2 December, after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle at Hamilton, he persuaded 200&#150;300 survivors of the army in the Kyle district of Ayrshire to disband (having failed to enlist them for the English). Strachan and another officer eventually led thirty men into the English camp.<br>
<br>Strachan's treason did not pass unnoticed in Scottish circles. On 14 December the commission of the general assembly cited him for refusing to fight, corresponding, and speaking with the English. On 3 January 1651 the commission initiated proceedings of excommunication against him for desertion of his charge (which was for the defence of religion and the kingdom), and for fraternization with the enemy. On the 12th the commission formally excommunicated him. The committee of estates cited him for treason on 31 March. Naturally, he failed to appear, and was sentenced in absentia. He died in November 1652, reputedly in despair over his excommunication. Between 1648 and 1650 Strachan had been of great service to the kirk party. His actions after the battle of Hamilton earned him the hatred of all but the minute republican element in Scottish politics.<br>
