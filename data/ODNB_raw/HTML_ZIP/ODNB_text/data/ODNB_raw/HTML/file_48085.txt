<span class="headword">Nickalls,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1828&#150;1899), <span class="occ">stock jobber</span>, was the elder son of Patteson Nickalls (<i>d</i>. 1868). His younger brother was Sir Patteson Nickalls (1836&#150;1910), a renowned pro-Boer Liberal and fellow stock jobber. Almost nothing is known about his early life, except that aged five he accompanied his father, a corn dealer, to Chicago. There, according to one source, Tom (as he was always known) &#145;hunted wolves in the forest&#146;  (Boase, <span class="italic">Mod. Eng. biog.</span>, 6.294). Nickalls returned to England in 1845. He married Emily, daughter of Henry Quihampton, a farmer, on 3 July 1860. She was to become the first woman to climb Mont Blanc and Mont Rosa in the same week. The couple first settled at Cheriton Villa in Bromley, Kent. Their eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35234/', "Guy Nickalls")</script>, was born on 12 November 1866 (<i>d</i>. 1935), and eleven others followed. All, except one, survived infancy&#151;a rare achievement for a Victorian family.<br>
<br>From 1864 up until his death Nickalls worked as a stock jobber in the City of London, concerned with the business of selling securities to stockbrokers, and playing a key role in setting prices on the exchange. He was to become highly successful in his chosen career and one of the leading jobbers on the American market. Yet in 1868 he suffered a severe setback. At the suggestion of some of its more senior members, who promised to pay his costs, he (according to his son's account) agreed to fight a stock exchange law case. Unfortunately for Nickalls, Lord Chief Justice Bovill later ruled against such a payment, and he was told to foot the bill of &pound;18,000. This, however, seems to have had little real effect on the enterprising Tom, as he subsequently embarked on a European tour with his wife and children. From 1868 they lived at Holmesdale House, Horton Kirby, Kent.<br>
<br>Nickalls became active in the vigorously competitive (and in contemporary stock exchange terms, most largely dealt-in) world of American railroad financing. In 1872 his prominence and success in the American markets earned him the accolade the &#145;Erie King&#146;. A clerk of the 1870s remembers Nickalls as a great, burly man whose habit was &#145;to come into the market and bellow, &#147;I buy Eries.&#148;&#146;  (Kynaston, <span class="italic">The City of London</span>, 38). Despite the dubious ethical standards applied in railroad financing, Nickalls always displayed integrity and independence of mind. Not only was he the most significant jobber in the American market, but he was also a well-liked figure on the stock exchange. He must also have exerted a deal of influence over his sons Guy and Vivian, who both chose to follow him onto the exchange.<br>
<br>Nickalls was a keen sportsman. He had been an original member of the London Rowing Club (founded in 1856), and in 1879 he became master of the Surrey stag hounds. In 1887 he bought a large sporting estate in Sweden and then another adjoining it in Norway. He also ensured that his children were taught shooting, horse and hound riding, cricket, boxing, and billiards during their holidays.<br>
<br>Despite his early rowing accomplishments, Tom's great ambition was for his sons to become cricketers; Guy remembered his saying: &#145;Cricket, my boy, will take you round the world, and rowing, up and down the Thames&#146;  (G. O. Nickalls, 38). However, he did not seem too disappointed when Guy took to rowing at Eton and Oxford, culminating in his captaincy of the university boat club. On one famous occasion in 1890 Nickalls senior treated his son's crew to a long weekend at Brighton's Grand Hotel to prepare themselves for the boat race. When Oxford won Guy recalled that his father slipped him a cheque for &pound;100, and joined in the post-race festivities. As he had just won &pound;7000 from a colleague on the stock exchange, by betting against Cambridge, Nickalls too had something to celebrate. Guy and Vivian dominated the Henley Diamond Sculls competition from 1888 to 1896.<br>
<br>Tom Nickalls died on 10 May 1899 at Patteson Court, near Redhill, Surrey, where he and his family had lived since 1872, and was buried at Nutfield; his wife survived him. A brief obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> read: &#145;He prospered in business, and while not neglecting the Stock Exchange, gave up much time to sport &hellip; Mr Nickalls was perhaps best known to the general public as the father of the famous scullers, Mr Guy and Mr Vivian Nickalls&#146;  (12 May 1899).<br>
