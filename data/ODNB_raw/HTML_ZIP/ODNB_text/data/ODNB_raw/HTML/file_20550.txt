<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  Calvagh</span>, lord of Tyrconnell  (<em>d.</em> 1566), <span class="occ">chief</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20556/', "Manus O'Donnell (d. 1563), lord of Tyrconnell")</script>, and his first wife, Siobh&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. in or after 1549), daughter of O'Reilly, chief of East Breifne. Calvagh first appears in the historical record in the early 1540s, when he is noted as supporting his father in his military campaigns in north Connaught and Ulster. In 1541 and 1542 Calvagh travelled to Dublin to endorse Manus's agreement with Sir Anthony St Leger, lord deputy, and in 1544 he brought military assistance from Dublin to Tyrconnell. By 1547, however, Calvagh was clearly trying to usurp his father's leadership in Tyrconnell and to prevent his brother Sir Hugh MacManus O'Donnell (<i>d</i>. 1592) from seizing control in the lordship.<br>
<br>Manus inflicted a military defeat on Calvagh and his ally, the O'Cahan, in 1548, and in the following year Sir Edward Bellingham, lord deputy, attempted to arbitrate between father and son. Both were summoned to Dublin, and Calvagh undertook to &#145;follow his father in all things lawful, and keep the King's peace towards his father and the whole country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts, 1515&#150;1574</span>, 221). In return, Calvagh was confirmed in possession of Lifford Castle, co. Donegal. Attempts were also made to resolve the conflict between Calvagh and his brother Hugh which seemed to have its origins in territorial control of the area around Lifford in east Tyrconnell.<br>
<br>Despite the 1549 agreement and another arbitration attempt by St Leger, again lord deputy, in 1552, the power struggle within Tyrconnell continued. In 1555 Calvagh bolstered his position with an agreement with Archibald Campbell, fourth earl of Argyll, through which he acquired the assistance of significant numbers of Scottish mercenary soldiers, or redshanks, and the use of a ramming gun for breaking castle walls, the famous &#145;gonna cam&#146; or &#145;crooked gun&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, 5.1555). Strengthened by this military reinforcement, Calvagh imprisoned his father and seized control in Tyrconnell. Manus never resumed the position of lord.<br>
<br>Throughout the sixteenth century the O'Donnell lordship was riven with dynastic and family feuding, and Calvagh's conflicts with his father and brother were not unlike those which Manus had had with his own father and brothers in the early decades of the century. The feuding among the O'Donnells undermined the family's control in Tyrconnell and made it possible for Shane O'Neill to extend his ascendancy over the western part of Ulster. O'Neill also fuelled the dynastic struggle among the O'Donnells through his support for Manus's brother.<br>
<br>In 1557 O'Neill raided Tyrconnell with a large army. Calvagh reportedly sought military advice from his imprisoned father, and through a surprise nocturnal attack on the invader's camp he won a temporary victory over O'Neill's forces at Balleighan on Lough Swilly, co. Donegal. Calvagh's position was also bolstered by the plan of Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, the new lord deputy, to form an alliance of Ulster chiefs against O'Neill. Among Sussex's proposals was the creation of Calvagh as earl of Tyrconnell and the granting of tenure of his lands on the English model in order to enhance his status as leader of the anti-O'Neill forces in Ulster. In 1560 Calvagh, with Sussex's approval, strengthened his links with the Campbells through his marriage to Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1588), daughter of Hector M&ograve;r MacLean of Duart and his wife, and widow of Argyll. In his marriage agreement, which was partly a renewal of the 1555 arrangement, Calvagh gained access to 500 redshanks. In return, he agreed to pay annually to Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll, &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., the collection of which may have, in the long term, eroded his political support in Tyrconnell. Calvagh's daughter by a previous marriage to Sea&eacute;n O'Neill (<i>d</i>. before 1560), Mary, was O'Neill's wife. O'Neill mistreated her as a consequence of his defeat by Calvagh and she died in 1561. Katherine had received an excellent education and was described as &#145;very sober, wise and no less subtle, being not unlearned in the Latin tongue, speaketh good French, and as is said some little Italian&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/3/84). It is likely that the mother of Conn O'Donnell (<i>d</i>. 1583) was Calvagh's first wife, rather than Katherine. Conn was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20558/', "Sir Niall Garbh O'Donnell (1568/9&#150;1626?)")</script>.<br>
<br>On 14 May 1561 O'Neill fatally weakened Sussex's Ulster confederacy by seizing Calvagh and his wife and imprisoning them at Tyrone. The couple were taken from the monastery of Kildonnell in co. Donegal. Sir William Fitzwilliam, lord justice, suspected Katherine of complicity in the seizure. However, Calvagh was in no doubt that O'Neill was assisted by his own kinsmen, particularly Hugh. During his imprisonment he claimed that he was subject to degrading treatment. An iron collar was placed around his neck which was fastened by a short chain to bolts on his ankles so that he could neither stretch his legs nor stand up straight. In the meantime, O'Neill was strengthening his control over the leaderless Tyrconnell. He devastated the countryside&#151;killing, by Calvagh's estimate, almost 4500 people, which must have represented a sizeable percentage of the total population in the lordship. O'Neill also garrisoned several castles and recognized Hugh as lord of Tyrconnell. When Sussex led a military campaign into Tyrone to avenge Calvagh's capture, the latter was moved into the inner recesses of the region to prevent the lord deputy rescuing him. In early 1564 O'Neill agreed to release Calvagh on payment of a ransom and the promise that Lifford Castle would be delivered to him. Katherine was not released at the same time, allegedly because O'Neill hoped to secure a ransom from the MacLeans for her. She was reported to have been chained by day to the arm of a small boy and released only at night when O'Neill was present. She may have subsequently married O'Neill with the support of her family. She had several children with him and was with him when he was killed.<br>
<br>On Calvagh's release he refused to abide by the terms of his ransom. In response O'Neill imprisoned Conn and threatened to cut his leg off if he did not get Lifford. Calvagh in the meantime travelled to Dublin to ask for military assistance against O'Neill. The Dublin administration under Sir Nicholas Arnold, lord justice, was unwilling to take any action which might provoke O'Neill's hostility and refused a licence to Calvagh to travel to London. In his report to the privy council Sir Thomas Cusack, lord chancellor, suggested that Calvagh had little support in Tyrconnell and downplayed his criticisms of O'Neill. Defying the instructions of the Irish privy council, Calvagh went to London where he submitted his grievances to Elizabeth I. His account of his treatment at the hands of O'Neill and the continuing reports of the latter's military victories in Ulster convinced the queen that O'Neill could not be dealt with through the conciliatory policy advocated by the Irish privy council. She wrote to Arnold that she was not without sympathy for Calvagh's position and ordered him to pay him some maintenance. Nevertheless, Calvagh was not returned immediately to Dublin and remained in London until 1566.<br>
<br>In 1565 Sir Henry Sidney was appointed lord deputy and formulated a plan to consolidate crown support among the lesser chiefs of Ulster and north Connaught which included the restoration of Calvagh to the lordship of Tyrconnell. Calvagh travelled back to Ireland with Sidney and in September 1566 he accompanied the lord deputy on his two-month journey through Ulster. Sidney formally returned Calvagh to the castles in Tyrconnell which had been seized by O'Neill. On 20 October, at Ballyshannon, co. Donegal, in an indenture with Sidney, Calvagh thanked the queen for his restoration, pledged his loyalty to her, and undertook to assist the lord deputy in his military campaigns against O'Neill. He also agreed to support Elizabeth if she &#145;should hereafter be pleased to change the usages or institutions of his country, and to reduce it to civil order and obedience to her laws like the English parts of this realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts, 1515&#150;1574</span>, 374). Sidney also made separate indentures with Calvagh's brother Hugh and his uncle Hugh Dubh O'Donnell, although the question of the O'Donnell succession was left undecided. In the event, Calvagh had little time to test the strength of his family's loyalty or that of Sidney. On 26 October 1566, as he was riding to Derry to assist the English captain Edward Randolph, he fell dead from his horse, having suffered either a fit or a heart attack. He was buried in Donegal Abbey. Calvagh was praised by Gaelic annalists for his bravery, steadfastness, and kindness. He was succeeded by his brother Hugh.<br>
