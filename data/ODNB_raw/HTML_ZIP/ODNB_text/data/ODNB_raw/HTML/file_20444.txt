<span class="headword">&Oacute; Briain,  Conchobhar</span> <span class="st"> [Conor O'Brien]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1268), <span class="occ">king of Thomond</span>, succeeded his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20451/', "Donnchad Cairprech &#211; Briain")</script>, in 1242. The early years of his reign were dominated by a series of royal grants which threatened to move a great deal of the U&iacute; Briain lands, already essentially limited to modern co. Clare, into Anglo-Norman hands. Pleas to Henry III had little effect (Ireland had been granted to Henry's son Edward in 1254), and in 1257 a wave of invasions into Thomond threatened to overwhelm Conchobhar. He and his more militant son Tadg seem to have held firm against these, and the following year Conchobhar raided into Galway and destroyed manors of the English Fitzgerald family, while Tadg went to a meeting at C&aacute;eluisce with Brian &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, recorded in the annals and, in rather more detail, in the <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span> (&#145;The triumphs of Toirdelbach&#146;). This was written in the mid-fourteenth century, to promote the history of the descendants of Tadg over those of his brother Brian, and to vilify the treacherous Clares, Brian's erstwhile allies. The <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im</span> relates that the meeting fell apart when Tadg's gift of a hundred horses to &Oacute; Ne&iacute;ll (a traditional claim to supremacy, and thus, in this context, to the high-kingship) was returned with two hundred more.<br>
<br>In 1259 Tadg died, an event described by the annals as &#145;good news to the foreigners&#146;  (annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 1260, <i>recte</i> 1259). According to the <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im</span>, Conchobhar &Oacute; Briain fell into a deep depression and no longer appeared in public, as a result of which his subjects ceased paying their royal dues. This story, however, may stem from the <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im's</span> concern to promote Tadg's importance: certainly Conchobhar had a notable success against the Fitzgeralds when they invaded in 1260, though in 1261 he seems to have made his peace. He attempted to reassert his authority in the context of intensified rivalries between the great Anglo-Irish lords, particularly between the de Burghs and the Fitzgeralds. These may have been exacerbated by the absence of central control during the barons' war in England. After the seizure of the justiciar by Maurice fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1286) and Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1268) in December 1264, Ireland descended into civil war, and the Gaelic lords must have seen their opportunity. Conchobhar &Oacute; Briain mustered his forces and raided across the Shannon for tribute, bringing it back to a newly constructed stronghold at Clonroad.<br>
<br>Soon after, in 1268, &Oacute; Briain raided northwards once more. This time, though, he was attacked by Diarmait, son of Muirchertach &Oacute; Briain, at Belaclugga, and he and many of his family and followers were killed, on 22 May 1268 according to the annals of Inisfallen. The <span class="italic">Caithre&iacute;m</span> account ascribes the attack to &#145;Conor <i>carrach</i> &Oacute; Lochlainn&#146;, but the annals seem clear that the only &Oacute; Lochlainn mentioned, Dublochlann &Oacute; Lochlainn, was on Conchobhar's side and that Diarmait, whose death soon after they record with an air of satisfaction, was the attacker. The body was taken to the monastery of East Burren or Corcomrua and buried there, where an effigy survives.<br>
<br>With his wife M&oacute;r, a member of the Mac Con Mara family, Conchobhar &Oacute; Briain had three known sons, Tadg, Seonin, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20441/', "Brian Ruadh &#211; Briain")</script>, of whom only Brian survived to succeed. His daughter and her son with Ruaidri &Oacute; Grada were killed alongside Conchobhar and Seonin at Belaclugga. Tadg's son Toirdelbach survived however, and the struggle between his family and that of Brian Ruadh for the leadership of the U&iacute; Briain was to dominate Thomond for many years.<br>
