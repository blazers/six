<span class="headword">Cook,  John Douglas</span>  (1808?&#150;1868), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born at Banchory-Ternan in Aberdeenshire, probably in 1808, although he favoured 1811. An unsubstantiated rumour suggested he was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13737/', "Thomas Hope (1769&#150;1831)")</script>, author, and thus half-brother to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13713/', "Rt Hon. A. J. B. Beresford Hope")</script>, Conservative politician, who affirmed the earlier date  (Bevington, 10&#150;11). Cook may have attended the University of Aberdeen  (Escott, 231). At an early age he obtained an appointment as a clerk in India, probably through an uncle, Sir George Rose. After a quarrel with his employers Cook returned, on foot for a great part of the way. Destitute in London, he tried literature, possibly including hack work. After an anonymous article was accepted by <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he became a reporter, leader writer, and friend of John Walter, the proprietor. Cook also indexed the early volumes of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. When Walter was elected for Nottingham as a tory in 1841, Cook served as his canvassing agent and became acquainted with Lord Lincoln (later fifth duke of Newcastle), who appointed Cook as secretary to his newly established commission inquiring into the revenues of the duchy of Cornwall.<br>
<br>About 1848 some Peelites, including Lincoln, bought the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and appointed Cook the editor. As Lincoln's <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> Cook took close instruction from him on the line that the paper was to take, and its stance became determinedly Peelite. He had close relations, too, with Gladstone, who as well as taking Cook's advice regarded him as a useful publicist and intermediary. Cook showed great resourcefulness, originality, and imagination, but spent money lavishly. He hired Philip Harwood as co-editor; they worked together until Cook's death. One contributor, Henry Maine, recruited his Cambridge pupils Vernon Harcourt and James Fitzjames Stephen. The paper, though a literary success with such works as Henry Mayhew's series &#145;Labour and the poor&#146;, was a political and financial failure. It was sold in 1854 and Cook was replaced as editor.<br>
<br>Cook planned a new journalistic venture with a contributor, Beresford Hope, which was to be the joint property of the two with the power of purchase secured to the survivor. The new weekly paper, the <span class="italic">Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art</span>, first appeared on 3 November 1855 and became an organ of moderate conservatism, policing the world of letters and politics. Business relations between Cook and Beresford Hope were frequently strained by Cook's tendency to overrule his partner's political and religious stances despite Beresford Hope's greater financial contribution. Cook kept the paper as much as possible out of theological controversy and made it a rule to have &#145;the Liberals to write on matters where they were most conservative, and the Conservatives on topics which they could treat liberally&#146;  (Griffiths, 168). As circulation increased, due to the excellent editing and lively writing, so did the size and scope of the paper. Because Cook valued scholarly, politically minded young men who could address an educated readership, nearly all his contributors were graduates of Oxford or Cambridge and loyal writers from the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. Over the years contributors left to become eminent in various directions; however controversy over <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> caused several regulars to depart, eventually won over by Cook's tact. The <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> became the leading critical weekly at least partially as a result of the addition of John Morley from 1863 until 1867, who attributed his journalistic success to his patron John Douglas Cook, &#145;the queer, intemperate, and almost illiterate, but wonderfully successful editor-manager&#146;  (Hirst, 38). At Cook's instigation Morley wrote the slashing review of Swinburne's <span class="italic">Poems and Ballads</span>. Leslie Stephen joined his brother on the staff in 1865. To keep harmonious unity, these three were among those restricted to writing middles and reviews and kept away from the leaders. Although Cook paid less generously than on the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, he did provide Morley and Leslie Stephen with an annual retainer fee. An annual dinner for male contributors inspired Cook's staff with the sense of honour and privilege gained through writing for the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. Eliza Lynn Linton, formerly with the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> until an angry disagreement with Cook, contributed &#145;The girl of the period&#146; (14 March 1868), perhaps the most sensational middle article of Cook's editorship.<br>
<br>Cook's instinct for recognizing ability in others and his judgement in directing them made him one of the most efficient editors of his day. Each Tuesday he presented writers with their assignments in his rooms at The Albany, Piccadilly, London; Harwood remained in charge of the office at Southampton Street. Cook was an exacting editor and reader, unstinting of himself and his health. He spent only brief vacations at his house in Tintagel, Cornwall&#151;purchased with profits from the weekly&#151;at which he annually entertained the Beresford Hopes. He died, unmarried, of chronic liver disease in his rooms in The Albany on 10 August 1868, and was buried at Tintagel. No notice appeared in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> at Beresford Hope's request; however a memorial tribute in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> was reprinted in <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
