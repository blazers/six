<span class="headword">Dadoo,  Yusuf Mohamed</span>  (1909&#150;1983), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and politician in South Africa</span>, was born in Krugersdorp, Transvaal, on 5 September 1909, one of five children of Mohamed Dadoo, a merchant originally from Kholvad in Gujarat, India, and Fatima Wadee. In the Transvaal Indians could not vote or own property except within segregated areas. Dadoo's father none the less owned one of the largest stores in the central business district of Krugersdorp, thwarting the municipality's attempts to evict him by employing a legal argument that his premises were owned by a company, Dadoo Limited, and a company had no race.<br>
<br>Dadoo went to school in Bree Street, Newtown, a suburb of Johannesburg. His daily train journey was marked by taunts from white youths who would derogatorily call him a &#145;coolie&#146; or &#145;Sammy&#146;. He was inspired at school by Indian nationalist teachers who supported the non-co-operation movement led by Mohandas Gandhi in India. Aged fourteen he participated in a protest action against the <span class="roman">Class Areas Bill</span>, which aimed to impose residential segregation upon Indians throughout South Africa. In the absence of higher education facilities for Indians in the Transvaal, between 1925 and 1927 he attended Aligarh Muslim College in India, where he attended meetings of the Indian National Congress. He returned to work in his father's shop but was restless. He wanted to study law but his father reluctantly suggested medicine instead.<br>
<br>As a young medical student in London in 1929 Dadoo was easily distracted by protests against the limited attempts by the British to consider political reforms for India. Arrested in a demonstration against the Simon commission in April 1929, he was transferred by his father to study in Edinburgh, where his politicization grew. He read the works of Marx and Engels and also the biography of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian Congress leader who urged the unity of all the oppressed. Dadoo joined the Independent Labour Party as well as the League Against Imperialism, began addressing public meetings, and took part in a hunger march in London in 1934. At Edinburgh he also made lasting friendships with two fellow students from South Africa, Mohambry (Monty) Naicker and Goonam Naidoo.<br>
<br>After gaining his medical qualifications in Edinburgh, in 1936, Dadoo returned to South Africa and established a medical practice at 47 End Street in Fordsburg, Johannesburg. He soon emerged as a leader with a devoted following among Indians. Gaining a position on the executive of the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC), he sought to wrest control from the conservative Muslim merchants who dominated the organization during the 1930s. They favoured tactics of negotiation and moderation, while Dadoo argued for passive resistance against measures such as the <span class="roman">Transvaal Asiatic Land and Trading Act</span> of 1939 which prohibited for three years the acquisition by Indians of new trading licences outside the Indian locations. Dadoo skilfully drew around him Indian nationalists and veterans of Mohandas Gandhi's passive resistance struggle, and crowds as large as 6000 attended meetings, among them many women. During the struggle for control of the TIC, Dadoo received death threats and narrowly escaped being stabbed at a meeting in June 1939. He and his supporters called off the planned resistance campaign scheduled for 1 August on Gandhi's advice that there was still room for negotiation between the Indian and South African governments.<br>
<br>Dadoo was also elected to the national council of the Non-European United Front (NEUF), launched in 1938 by coloured intellectuals in Cape Town, and in 1939 he joined the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA). Through these organizations he broke the mould of traditional Indian politics. His friends were communists and trade unionists like John B. Marks and Moses Kotane, and members of the Transvaal branch of the African National Congress (ANC). He became well known in black townships through the opposition of the NEUF and the Communist Party to the decision of the government of Jan Smuts to support the British war effort. Dadoo regarded it as an imperialist war and not as one for democracy, and highlighted the poverty of the black working class. In August 1940 he was fined for inciting blacks against the war, and in 1941 served a four-month prison sentence. He led the nationalist bloc of the TIC which also opposed the war and which supported the Quit India movement. When Russia joined the war in June 1941 Dadoo and others toed the Communist Party line that this was now a &#145;people's war&#146;. It was a tribute to his personality and leadership that he retained support among Indian nationalists despite the turnaround on the war issue. In the early 1940s he married Ilsa Pragar, a German, with whom he had a daughter, born in 1945.<br>
<br>In 1945 Dadoo won control of the TIC, having served with the president of the ANC, Dr A. B. Xuma, on the National Anti-Pass Council and participated in the campaigns against the pass laws of 1943&#150;5. Charged along with other members of the Communist Party for inciting African workers in the miners' strike of 1946, he was sentenced in June 1946 to three months' imprisonment with hard labour. Between 1946 and 1948 he and Dr Monty Naicker, now president of the Natal Indian Congress (NIC), led the passive resistance movement against the <span class="roman">Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act</span> of 1946, which limited land occupation rights in Natal and the Transvaal and provided separate and limited political representation for Indians in parliament. In March 1947 Dadoo, Naicker, and Xuma&#151;presidents of the TIC, NIC, and ANC respectively&#151;signed a joint declaration of co-operation which became known as the &#145;doctors' pact&#146;, pledging them to work together to secure equal rights. He and Naicker went to India to raise support for the struggle, and addressed the Asian Relations conference in New Delhi. Returning to South Africa, Dadoo was sentenced to a further six months' imprisonment in February 1948: some 2000 Indians were gaoled before the passive resistance campaign was called off in June 1948.<br>
<br>The National Party, which came to power in South Africa in May 1948, attempted to restrict Dadoo's travel and placed him under surveillance when he visited London in 1949. Early in 1950, as president of the South African Indian Congress (SAIC), he was banned from addressing public meetings. In July 1951 he and Yusuf Cachalia, representing the SAIC, and James Moroka, Walter Sisulu, and J. B. Marks of the ANC constituted the joint planning council, which tabled a report proposing a campaign of defiance against the apartheid laws. During the defiance campaign launched in June 1952 Dadoo defied his banning order, and received a six-month prison sentence. In August 1952 he was among twenty individuals (who also included Nelson Mandela) arrested under the <span class="roman">Suppression of Communism Act</span> of 1950, which had forced the CPSA to disband, and was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment suspended for three years.<br>
<br>In 1953 Dadoo was involved in re-establishing the Communist Party, now renamed the South African Communist Party (SACP). He served on its central committee and set up its secret cells. In 1955, while still banned from attending gatherings, he was given the highest tribute (together with Chief Albert Luthuli and Trevor Huddleston) at the Congress of the People in Kliptown, Johannesburg&#151;the Isitwalandwe-Seaparankoe (&#145;the one who wears the plumes of the rare bird&#146;) award. This period of isolation and clandestine activity was hard on Dadoo, whose colleagues knew that he functioned best as a crowd-puller. His first marriage had meanwhile broken up, and in 1955 he married again. His second wife, Mariam, was a Muslim from Reunion Island with children of her own; this marriage also collapsed.<br>
<br>As a result of the clampdown on political activity following the Sharpeville massacre of 21 March 1960 the SACP and SAIC decided that Dadoo would best serve the movement if he went into exile. His secret journey out of South Africa began by road to Bechuanaland, by plane to Tanganyika, and then to London, where he arrived in April 1960 and lived in exile for the rest of his life. In 1960 he married Winnie Kramer, a Jewish journalist and communist whom he had known in South Africa since 1948. They first lived in small premises provided by the Indian League but eventually settled in Muswell Hill, where their daughter was born in 1962.<br>
<br>When in 1969 the ANC in exile under the leadership of Oliver Tambo opened up its membership to non-Africans, Dadoo and Joe Slovo secured positions on the revolutionary council. Their brief was to facilitate the development of Umkhonto we Siswe (the military wing of the ANC), organize training and funds for its soldiers, and implement plans for attacks on South African soil. As chairman of the SACP from 1972 Dadoo travelled to the Soviet Union and around Europe, wrote and gave speeches, and liaised with anti-apartheid movements. He warned Indian South Africans not to be seduced by separatist offerings of the National Party. He was committed to the international solidarity of communism and its foundations: the education of youth in Marxist&#150;Leninist tracts; &#145;unqualified discipline&#146;, &#145;commitment&#146;, and &#145;unswerving loyalty and respect &hellip; for the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union]&#146;; and the organization of the working class  (Reddy, <span class="italic">Dr Yusuf Mohamed Dadoo</span>, 393).<br>
<br>Dadoo died of cancer at the Whittington Hospital, Islington, London, on 19 September 1983, and was buried according to Muslim rites at Highgate cemetery, near the grave of Karl Marx. &#145;Doc&#146; or &#145;Mota&#146; (&#145;elder brother&#146;), as he was popularly known, was paid a high tribute by Oliver Tambo: more than simply a leader of the Indian community in South Africa, Dadoo was one of the &#145;foremost national leaders of our country&#146;  (Reddy, <span class="italic">Dr Yusuf Mohamed Dadoo</span>, 391). The reasons for his high standing included his sharp intellect, his charisma, his forwarding-looking speeches, and his very wide network of political colleagues among all races. Friends recalled his &#145;sense of humour&#146;, his &#145;fun loving side&#146;, his simplicity, his charm with women, his pipe-smoking, but also his passion for taking action on social and political issues  (Meer, 72&#150;3). Others have pointed to his &#145;internationalism&#146;; his foresight in urging a united front against apartheid  (Reddy, <span class="italic">Dr Yusuf Mohamed Dadoo</span>, 390&#150;92); and his skill &#145;in mediating a seeming contradiction between Gandhism and the politics of the Communist Party of South Africa&#146;  (Raman, 27). In 1939 Gandhi's daughter-in-law Sushila explained his appeal: &#145;Dr Dadoo &hellip; has strength of character and other good qualities and does not seek status. He is Muslim but not sectarian. He is a communist and is counted as one of Jawaharlalji's [Nehru's] followers&#146;  (Dhupelia-Mesthrie, 252). He successfully balanced his Muslim, Indian, and African identities with his international identity as a communist. As Eskia Mphahlele wrote: &#145;One might say Yusuf Dadoo has a Marxist head, a Hindu heart, Mohammedan nails, and an African blood-system&#146;  (Mphahlele, &#145;Doctor Dadoo's dilemma&#146;).<br>
