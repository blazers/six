<span class="headword">Ward <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Sheed]</span>,  Mary Josephine <span class="st"> [Maisie]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1975), <span class="occ">writer and publisher</span>, was born on 4 January 1889 at Snowdon House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight, the first of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36737/', "Wilfrid Philip Ward (1856&#150;1916)")</script>, biographer and editor of the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, and his wife, Josephine Mary Hope-Scott (1864&#150;1932), Catholic novelist and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13741/', "James Robert Hope-Scott")</script> and Victoria Howard. Her parents were both English. On her maternal side she was related to the duke of Norfolk, the highest ranking Catholic peer, and on her paternal side to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28713/', "William George Ward")</script>, Oxford don, colleague of John Henry Newman, and the first of the Oxford Movement to &#145;go over to Rome&#146;. All four of her grandparents were converts to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Maisie, as she was always known, lived initially on the Isle of Wight, where the Ward family had considerable influence, and later in Eastbourne and then Dorking. After her father's death she lived with her mother in London. One brother died in youth, another lived on the Isle of Wight, and the youngest became a priest and died young. Her only sister married and became a writer, but like the youngest brother she was psychologically fragile. Maisie was educated at home, at a convent school in Dorking, and at St Mary's Convent School, a boarding-school in Cambridge (1905&#150;6), where she displayed a good command of Latin. She was influenced there by the preaching of Robert Hugh Benson and the inspiration of the seventeenth-century Mary Ward, whose nuns ran the school.<br>
<br>The atmosphere of the Ward home was Catholic and intellectual. Both parents were prolific writers who included among their friends Catholic intellectuals of the day&#151;G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Friedrich and Anatole von H&uuml;gel, and William Basil Maturin. Her father's difficult confrontation with the modernist movement left its mark on Maisie. After finishing her schooling she worked as his secretary and during the First World War volunteered for the Red Cross. Although her younger brothers attended Oxford, she did not, even though she was encouraged to do so by her teachers. By her own account, for almost fifteen years she dithered away her life.<br>
<br>In 1919 Maisie Ward's life changed when she became a founding member of the Catholic Evidence Guild (CEG); she remained active in this movement for almost fifty years. Through it she met her future husband, an Australian law student, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66037/', "Francis Joseph Sheed (1897&#150;1981)")</script>, whom she married on 27 April 1926. The CEG played a major role in their professional and personal lives. They devoted many hours each week to training and speaking. In the year of their marriage they co-founded the publishing firm of Sheed and Ward with money given by Josephine Ward. Many CEG friends joined them in working at Sheed and Ward, which Tom Burns in <span class="italic">The Use of Memory: Publishing and Further Pursuits</span> (1993) called a cross between &#145;a sweat-shop and a university&#146;. Seven years later an American office of Sheed and Ward was opened in New York. It was only in 1973 that the Sheeds sold the American company.<br>
<br>Through her twenty-seven books and her work in the firm Ward influenced several generations of educated Anglo-American Catholics. Beginning in the late 1920s Sheed and Ward took the continental Catholic intellectual revival first to England and then to the United States. Sheed and Ward authors included the French authors Leon Bloy, Fran&ccedil;ois Mauriac, and Paul Claudel, and the English Christopher Dawson, E. I. Watkin, C. C. Martindale, Martin D'Arcy, and Ronald Knox, as well as Frank Sheed. Maisie first translated and edited volumes for Sheed and Ward. An early contribution was <span class="italic">The English Way</span> (1933), edited essays about English spiritual writers from Bede to Newman. Her first major publication was <span class="italic">The Wilfrid Wards and the Transition</span> (1934, 1937), a two-volume study of the Ward family which established her as heir of William George Ward and hence the &#145;granddaughter of the Oxford Movement&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1927 Maisie gave birth to Rosemary; three years later Wilfrid was born. The latter became a noted American writer and essayist. The Sheeds' domestic life was managed by Frank's Australian mother, who lived with the family. For many years the Sheeds lived at Horley in Surrey, where they opened a chapel which served the rural Catholic community. Frank and Maisie educated the community in the faith, in music, and in liturgical practice.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Maisie and their children moved to Torresdale, near Philadelphia, while Frank continued to travel back and forth to London to maintain the publishing business. During these war years Maisie wrote <span class="italic">This Burning Heat: Gilbert Keith Chesterton</span> (1943), her most popular book, and <span class="italic">The Splendor of the Rosary</span> (1945). She returned to England after the war and published her favourite book, <span class="italic">Young Mr. Newman</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">Return to Chesterton</span> (1952). Her interest in the priest-worker movement led to <span class="italic">France Pagan?</span> (1949), and efforts to bolster family life produced <span class="italic">Be not Solicitous</span> (1953). In the 1950s she turned to religious topics and wrote <span class="italic">They Saw His Glory: an Introduction to the Gospels and Acts</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">Saints who Made History</span> (1959). She commemorated the life of her friend Caryll Houselander in <span class="italic">The Divine Eccentric</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">The Letters of Caryll Houselander</span> (1965). Her final major work was a two-volume study, <span class="italic">Robert Browning and his World</span> (1967&#150;9), which celebrated her favourite poet. She wrote two autobiographies: <span class="italic">Unfinished Business</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">To and fro on the Earth</span> (1973). Almost all of her books were published by Sheed and Ward. Although her prose was never brilliant, her research was extensive, and she wrote with an obvious and contagious sympathy and enthusiasm.<br>
<br>After 1940 Ward travelled extensively between England, the continent, and America, and later to Australia and Asia. The purpose of this travel was often research and lecturing. This did not deter her writing, which she did in hotels, on planes and trains, and in waiting-rooms.<br>
<br>Ward's prodigious writing life was paralleled by a commitment to social concerns. She was a great friend of Dorothy Day, the American who founded the Catholic Worker Movement, although they differed on the issue of pacifism. She also worked with the Russian Baroness Catherine de Hueck, founder of Friendship House. During her early married life she was influenced by distributism and operated several unsuccessful farms. Her love of community led her to support the Marycrest community in New York, the Taena community in England, the Canadian maritime co-operatives, priest-worker groups in France, and the land reform movement in India. She was co-founder of the Catholic Housing Aid Society in England, which worked to ameliorate the housing crisis created by the war.<br>
<br>Ward's literary, religious, and social interests became the subjects of the lecturing on street corners, at Catholic colleges and universities, and at church gatherings, particularly in the United States. She was usually the only woman on the speakers' platform, appearing with prelates, priests, and laymen. Although not considered a handsome woman, she was charming and attentive and won others over through her evident dedication and erudition. In America her success as a speaker was in part attributable to her English breeding and manner of speech. In private she was reserved and retiring except when engaged with ideas. She was immensely forthright and, by her own definition, not a feminine woman; she was too steely, demanding, and unwilling to ingratiate. She was blindly loyal to family and friends and she and her husband always presented a unified stance in public.<br>
<br>Maisie Ward's life was framed by her Catholicism and her Ward family history. Through these family connections and her writing and work she reflected in microcosm the history of the Roman Catholic church in the Anglo-American world for a century and a half. Her visibility and influence were greater in the United States than in England. With her husband she helped to prepare Catholic laity for the changes of the Second Vatican Council. Sheed and Ward published work by many of the leading theologians of the council, including Hans Kung, F. X. Durrwell, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Karl Rahner, and Edward Schillebeeckx. Ironically, Maisie, and Frank even more so, interpreted the realization of some of the council's changes as injurious to the church. While her second autobiography, written two years before her death, described the confusion she saw in the church after the Vatican Council, it continued to affirm the need to heal suffering in the world.<br>
<br>The contribution of Maisie Ward is not based on any one of her multiple activities&#151;her writing, social commitments, publishing, lecturing, or street preaching&#151;but rather on the totality of these efforts which refer back to an inner dynamism and dedication to the principles of her Catholic faith. In the global reach of these activities and in her ability to sustain them into the last years of her life she was remarkable. In the world of publishing and Catholic intellectual life she was as a woman <i>sui generis</i>. For the last decade of her life she lived permanently in the United States in New Jersey. She died in City Hospital, New York, on 28 January 1975 after a short illness and was buried on 30 January in Jersey City, New Jersey. She predeceased Frank Sheed, who was eight years her junior.<br>
