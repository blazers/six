<span class="headword">Maclean,  John</span> <span class="st"> [Iain Mac-Gilleain]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1756), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet and Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the son of Ewen Maclean, laird of Treshnish, a group of Hebridean isles 5&frac12; miles south-east of Coll and 3 miles west of the entrance of Loch Tuadh on the Isle of Mull. The Treshnish Macleans formed the second branch of the family of the Macleans of Ardgour. Sinclair states that Ewen Maclean had two natural sons named John and Lachlan  (Sinclair, <span class="italic">Clan Gillean</span>, 330&#150;35). He married Margaret, daughter of Neil Maclean of Drimnacross on Coll, and they had two sons, Hector and a second boy named John. The poet John is said by Sinclair to have been Ewen's eldest son (ibid. and Sinclair, <span class="italic">The Maclean Bards</span>, 221&#150;34). John Patterson Maclean, however, refers to him as Ewen's third son  (J. P. Maclean, 275&#150;8). Whatever their order of birth, it was the other John who succeeded Ewen as the last Maclean of Treshnish. Their brother Hector Maclean became the minister of Coll.<br>
<br>Maclean married Isabella, daughter of Charles Neil Bane Maclean, and had one son and three daughters. On 25 February 1702 he was licensed to preach and on 13 September 1702 was inducted to the pastoral charge of Kilninian and Kilmore on Mull. His predecessor, John Beaton, had become a prey to a feud between the Macleans of Duart and the Campbells of Ardnamurchan, and as a result was forced out of his charge. Beaton was the learned last member of the famous Mull medical family and had recorded the contents of the family's manuscript library. In Coleraine, in the north of Ireland, probably in February 1700, Beaton met Edward Lhuyd, the renowned Welsh polymath and keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, who, backed by subscribers, was making a grand tour of Celtic countries in search of archaeological, botanical, historical, and linguistic material, including Gaelic dialects.<br>
<br>Lhuyd later compiled a list of twelve questions, the answers to which would assist him with his researches. The questions related, <i>inter alia</i>, to information about Gaelic grammar, dictionaries, or vocabulary; fashions and customs of the highlanders; old coins, utensils, or arms; burrows or artificial mounds; old highland poets, historians, and physicians; Gaelic Christian names, and so on. On 13 April 1701 they were sent to John Maclean by the Revd Robert Wodrow, an ecclesiastical historian, with the request that he put them to Beaton, whom Wodrow had unsuccessfully tried to contact directly. Maclean succeeded in meeting Beaton and obtained informative responses to nine of the questions. Maclean's reply to Wodrow of 20 April 1702, written at Inveraray, was printed in <span class="italic">Analecta Scotica: collections illustrative of the civil, ecclesiastical and literary history of Scotland</span> (1st ser., 1834, 121&#150;5) and is reproduced in <span class="italic">Edward Lhuyd in the Scottish Highlands, 1699&#150;1700</span> by J. L. Campbell and Derick Thomson (1963, 25&#150;36).<br>
<br>In 1704 Edward Lhuyd published his <span class="italic">Archaeologia Britannica</span>, containing a Gaelic&#150;English vocabulary. In 1707 a second edition was issued containing complimentary poetical addresses from highland ministers, including one from John Maclean. A translation of this poem from the original Gaelic is contained in <span class="italic">The Literature of the Highlanders</span> by Nigel Macneill (2nd edn, 1929, 271&#150;2). Very few of Maclean's poems in Gaelic survive. Four, including his tribute to Lhuyd and an elegy for his wife, Isabella, appear in the Revd A. Maclean Sinclair's book <span class="italic">The Gaelic Bards: from 1715 to 1765</span>, and these four together with another, about the marriage of his daughter Anna, are printed in the first part of the same author's volumes <span class="italic">Na baird leathanach</span>.<br>
<br>As a minister Maclean was testified by the presbytery of Mull to be a man of great zeal for the interest of religion and the dignity of the ministerial character. He died on 12 March 1756 in the fifty-fourth year of his ministry, and was buried beside his father in Kilninian. He was succeeded as minister of Kilninian and Kilmore by his only son, Alexander.<br>
