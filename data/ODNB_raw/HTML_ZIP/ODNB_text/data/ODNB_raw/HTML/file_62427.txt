<span class="headword">FitzGerald,  Edward Arthur</span>  (1871&#150;1931), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born on 10 May 1871 at Litchfield, Connecticut, USA, the third son of William John FitzGerald, barrister, a British subject, and Mary, daughter of Eli White, of New York. He was educated at St Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1890 but did not graduate. In 1892 he married Jeanne Marie, daughter of Baron de Rothiacob of Rouen, France; she died the next year. In 1894 he joined part of William Martin Conway's walk across the Alps and met <a href="#cosubject_62427">Mattias Zurbriggen [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he hired as a guide for five years. In 1894&#150;5 he travelled with Zurbriggen to New Zealand, intending to climb Mount Cook, its highest peak, but local climbers reached the summit at Christmas, just after their arrival. Together FitzGerald and Zurbriggen made the first ascent of Mount Sefton, and, with Jack Clarke, one of the New Zealanders who climbed Mount Cook, first ascents of mounts Sealy, Silberhorn, Tasman, and Haidinger. Zurbriggen made a solo ascent of Mount Cook because FitzGerald only wanted to make first ascents. New Zealanders respected Zurbriggen's climbing, but resented FitzGerald's conceited and haughty attitude. FitzGerald exaggerated his achievements in a paper delivered to the Royal Geographical Society, &#145;The first crossing of the Southern Alps in New Zealand&#146;, and in <span class="italic">Climbs in the New Zealand Alps</span> (1896), which erased Clark's image from a photograph of the Mount Haidinger summit.<br>
<br>FitzGerald was very wealthy and best known for his large, personally financed expedition to South America in 1896&#150;7. He took a geologist, surveyor, engineer, and naturalist to make scientific surveys, and six alpine guides led by Zurbriggen. FitzGerald made several unsuccessful attempts before Zurbriggen went on alone to make the first ascent of Aconcagua (22,835 feet), the highest peak in the Americas. FitzGerald later suffered from typhoid fever, which delayed the publication of his <span class="italic">The Highest Andes</span> (1899).<br>
<br>In 1900 FitzGerald joined the imperial yeomanry to fight in the South African War, where he received a commission as second lieutenant in the 5th dragoon guards, and first lieutenant in 1901. He was later transferred to the Inniskilling dragoons, and was promoted captain in 1906, and major in 1912. He was employed in the War Office from 1914 to 1919. In 1903 he stopped climbing after an accident in Zermatt and married, at Hampstead register office, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38645/', "M&#233;nie Muriel Dowie (1866&#150;1945)")</script>, traveller and author, daughter of Muir Dowie, and formerly wife of Henry Norman (1858&#150;1939), who had divorced her after discovering that she had committed adultery with FitzGerald. They lived at 38 Green Street, Park Lane, London, and Marsden Manor, Rendcombe, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, where FitzGerald died on 2 January 1931.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_62427"></a><span class="headword">Mattias Zurbriggen</span>  (1856&#150;1917), <span class="occ">alpine guide</span>, was born on 15 May 1856 at Saas Fee, Switzerland, the son of Lorenz Zurbriggen (<i>d</i>. 1864), shoemaker and miner, and Veronica del Prato (<i>d</i>. 1890) of Stalden. After his father's death, he worked at a variety of jobs before becoming a mountain guide in Macugnaga, Italy. On 29 September 1885 he married Maria Orsola Schranz (<i>d</i>. 1912). On 28 February 1886, they had a daughter, Maria Margherita, who lived only a few hours, and on 25 August 1889 a son, Mattia Lorenzo, who emigrated to the United States about 1909. Mattias attracted the attention of ambitious British climbers, including Oscar Eckenstein, T. Fisher Unwin, and William Martin Conway, who invited him to the Karakoram in 1892. His partnership with Edward FitzGerald culminated in his first ascent of Aconcagua&#151;alone&#151;on 14 January 1897. In later years, he led Fanny Bullock Workman (1859&#150;1925) in the Karakoram, Prince Scipio Borghese (1871&#150;1927), and Professor Guilio Brocherel in the Celestial Mountains of Tien Shan (Tianshan), and Julius Kugy (1858&#150;1944) in the Alps. His autobiography, <span class="italic">From the Alps to the Andes</span> (1899), was the first published by an alpine guide, but his British patrons edited out the exuberance, extravagance, and passion for which he was known. After his return from Argentina, he began drinking excessively. Zurbriggen later left his wife in desolation, and moved to Geneva, where he worked for some years in the kitchen of an inn located on rue Blanvalet in the Eaux-Vives section. He committed suicide by hanging himself, and was found dead on 20 June 1917.<br>
