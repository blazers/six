<span class="headword">Eyre,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1732&#150;1804), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic apologist</span>, was the younger son and one of five surviving children of Thomas Eyre (1684?&#150;1749), a Roman Catholic landowner of Hassop Hall, Derbyshire, and Eastwell, Leicestershire, and his wife, Mary Holman (<i>d</i>. 1759), daughter and coheir of George Holman of Warkworth, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Lady Anastasia Howard. His maternal grandfather, William, Viscount Stafford, was beheaded after the Popish Plot. Eyre was educated at the English College at St Omer in France, and then at the Jesuit academy at Li&egrave;ge (<i>c</i>.1751&#150;1753). He lived principally at Warkworth, Northamptonshire, the estate settled on him by his father in 1746, and he was twice married. His first marriage, on 11 February 1755, was to Lady Mary Radcliffe (1732&#150;1796). Her father, the staunchly Jacobite Charles Radcliffe, who styled himself the fifth earl of Derwentwater (although legally no longer a peer), was executed after the rising of 1745. They had three sons and one daughter. The eldest, Francis (1762&#150;1827), became the sixth earl of Newburgh in 1814 (a title held by his maternal grandmother in her own right). Lady Mary Eyre died on 27 May 1796. Eyre's second marriage, in 1801, was to Sarah Hernon, sister of a Smithfield druggist, Robert Hernon, also a Catholic.<br>
<br>Although Eyre was a country squire for most of his life, his father's bequest in 1749 of all his books to the young Francis suggests strong scholarly interests. His first two published works, in 1778 and 1779, were pamphlets criticizing Edward Gibbon's irreligiosity in his <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>. In 1778 Eyre signed the <span class="italic">Humble Address of the Roman Catholic Peers and Commoners</span> declaring loyalty to the crown. On the death in March 1792 of his childless nephew Thomas Eyre, he inherited the family estate at Hassop in Derbyshire. He first offered this as a refuge to an exiled community of Catholic nuns from Li&egrave;ge, where he had been educated, and then gave it to his eldest son, Francis. This coincided with Eyre's appointment as one of three conciliators, with John Webbe Weston and William Sheldon of Brailes, in the religious disputes between the Catholic Committee, a body predominantly of lay gentry, and the vicars apostolic, representing the Roman Catholic clergy and their supporters. The mediators' report was accepted and printed in May 1792.<br>
<br>In 1795 Eyre published anonymously (as &#145;a sincere friend of mankind&#146;) <span class="italic">A short essay on the Christian religion &hellip; the whole proposed as a preservative against the pernicious doctrines which have overwhelmed France with misery and desolation</span>. In the same year, under his own name, Eyre responded to attacks on Roman Catholicism in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Rev. Ralph Churton MA</span>. Churton, a scholar and writer, rector of Middleton Cheney, Northamptonshire, since 1792 (and archdeacon of St David's, Wales, from 1805), replied in <span class="italic">A Short Defence of the Church of England</span> that &#145;Popery&#146; was a lie from beginning to end. Undeterred, Eyre closed the controversy in his 1798 <span class="italic">Reply to the Rev. Ralph Churton</span>, remarking on the happy decline of hostility between Anglicans and Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>A representative of traditional English Catholicism through his family connections and active in the internal disputes among co-religionists at the time of the passing of the second <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> in 1791&#150;2, Francis Eyre came to public notice as an impartial arbitrator. He died on 7 October 1804 in London, where he was then living.<br>
