<span class="headword">Kinnaird,  George</span>, first Lord Kinnaird of Inchture  (<em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of Patrick Kinnaird (<i>c</i>.1590&#150;<i>c</i>.1658) of Inchture, Perthshire, and his wife, Euphemia (<i>fl</i>. 1609), daughter of Gilbert Gray of Bandirran. He gained the reputation of being an ardent royalist. On 10 October 1659 the noblemen, gentlemen, and heritors of Perthshire appointed him and John Nairne of Muckersie to meet General George Monck in Edinburgh to discuss the affairs of the county. He appears to have pointed to the prospects for disorder if English troops were withdrawn and to have put the idea of authorizing local notables to keep order. On 3 December he had a further commission to go to Berwick, again to discuss Perthshire concerns with Monck. According to a tradition in the Carse of Gowrie, Perthshire, Monck was at this time particularly grateful to Kinnaird for arranging the provisions for his forces.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Charles II personally knighted Kinnaird in gratitude for his services to the royalist cause, creating him Sir George Kinnaird of Rossie, in Perthshire. According to John Lamont he was one of the first Scots upon whom Charles II conferred that honour. Also in 1661 he apparently received all the family properties from his elder brother, John. On 19 November 1650 he had married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1704), daughter of James Crichton of Ruthven, Perthshire, and they settled at Rossie, Perthshire, with their six sons.<br>
<br>Business frequently took Kinnaird to Edinburgh, however. He sat for Perthshire in the first Scottish parliament of the new reign and was a commissioner to visit the universities of Aberdeen and for the plantation of kirks. He became a member of the Scottish privy council (1661) and on 28 December 1682 was further rewarded with the title of first Lord Kinnaird of Inchture. When at home on his estate he had frequently been involved in arguments with his minister and local kirk session and appears to have ceased attending church during the covenanting period of the late 1660s and 1670s. In 1685 he voted for the execution by hanging rather than beheading of the leading covenanter Archibald, ninth earl of Argyll. Kinnaird died on 29 December 1689.<br>
