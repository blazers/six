<span class="headword">Austin,  Samuel</span>  (<em>b. </em>1605/6), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of Thomas Austin of Lostwithiel, Cornwall. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 16 July 1625, aged nineteen, and proceeded BA on 21 February 1628 and MA on 9 July 1630. At about this time, Wood notes, he &#145;was beneficed in his own country&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.499). His reputation rests on a single work written while he was still at Oxford, <span class="italic">Urania, or, The Heavenly Muse</span> (1629). The first book is dedicated to John Prideaux, then rector of Exeter College, and describes the fall of man; the second, dedicated to Mr John Robarts, &#145;son to my Lord Robarts, Baron of Truro&#146;, deals with the redemption. Another dedicatee, Mr Andrew Pollexfen, is described as his kinsman.<br>
<br>Given the overall length of the work (some 4000 lines), Austin's progress was not easy, as can be deduced from the dedication to Prideaux:<blockquote>If you knew but the paines I have suffer'd in travell hereof, how many precious houres and dayes I have detain'd from those sports and vanities which are common to others; yea, how much time I have stolne from my other private studies &hellip; But now (thankes bee to my God) I have at length finished it.</blockquote>In a prefatory poem Austin addresses all the poets of the day, and singles out &#145;those most refined wits and favourers of most exquisite learning, Mr. M. Drayton, Mr Will. Browne&#146;, as his &#145;ever honoured friends&#146;. He exhorts them to turn from secular to divine poetry. It was a subject inspired by his college, Exeter&#151;which had also been Browne's college&#151;and Austin praises the college in a separate dedication &#145;To that famous Nursery of Learning and Religion&#146;: we &#145;Must be Divine that take our births from thee&#146;. Austin's <span class="italic">Urania</span> is a committed exegesis on the biblical narratives of fall and redemption, and uses a deep knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as a basic framework. The poem alludes to specific passages of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> which form the foundation of the profoundly meditative <span class="italic">Urania</span>. These are referenced in marginal notes and accord with Austin's view of the poem, presented in the dedication, &#145;wherein is chiefly imitated the powerful expressions of holy Scripture: very necessary to be read of all, both Divines and others, especially those who labour under the heavie burden of their sinnes, and would faine be comforted&#146;. Under Prideaux, Exeter College had become a centre of resistance to Arminianism&#151;and within the wide-ranging <span class="italic">Urania</span> Austin includes a discussion and significantly a refutation of man's free will. To write on this at a time when the authorities were attempting to quell debate on the subject has been seen as a political act  (Norbrook, 233). Browne and Drayton were themselves notable examples of men who used their poetry to express opposition to the court.<br>
<br>No more is known of Austin. The poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/914/', "Samuel Austin")</script> is generally assumed to be his son.<br>
