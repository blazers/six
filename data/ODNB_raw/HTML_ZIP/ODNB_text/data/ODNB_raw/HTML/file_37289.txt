<span class="headword">Clarke,  Alexander Ross</span>  (1828&#150;1914), <span class="occ">geodesist</span>, was born on 16 December 1828 in Reading, the eldest son of David Ross Clarke, merchant, and his wife, Eliza, daughter of Charles Hall. After early years in Jamaica and Eriboll, Scotland, the family settled in London. Clarke entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and in 1847 came first in his class and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. In 1850 he was posted to the Ordnance Survey in Southampton; from 1851 to 1854 he was in Canada, returning in 1854 to serve from 1856 under Henry James as the survey's chief mathematical and scientific adviser.<br>
<br>Clarke entered the Ordnance Survey just as the observations from the principal triangulation (a term taken from Clarke's <span class="italic">Account</span>) of Great Britain were nearly complete. He was a skilled mathematician and, building on the work of William Yolland, reduced the measurements into a usable form with the method of least-squares, developed by leading continental mathematicians such as F. W. Bessel, C. F. Gauss, and F. G. W. Struve. The results were published as an <span class="italic">Account &hellip; of the Principal Triangulation</span> (1858), which greatly enhanced the Ordnance Survey's reputation for precision and contributed to the debate over the dimensions of the reference spheroid used for geodetic calculations, or, in the words of the time, the &#145;Figure of the Earth&#146;. The principal triangulation stood until the retriangulation began in 1935, but it was not used as a framework for the mapping of the United Kingdom, most of which depended on separate minor triangulations for each county or group of counties. Clarke's scientific achievement thus had few practical consequences.<br>
<br>In 1860 Clarke began an elaborate comparison of the standards of length used in England, France, Germany, Belgium, and Russia, as well as those of India and Australia. This was part of a European project, organized by F. G. W. Struve, to measure an arc from Valencia in Ireland to Orsk in Russia. The aim was to co-ordinate triangulations across Europe. Clarke thereby played a major part in the thrust towards international standardization that became so important in late nineteenth-century European science.<br>
<br>Clarke had a passionate interest in calculating the figure of the earth, another central problem for an accurate topographical survey. He tackled the problem on at least five separate occasions, and his results (especially one in the 1866 survey of standards of length) were employed throughout the world. In 1880 he published <span class="italic">Geodesy</span>, a textbook based on a major article written for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. This remained a standard work well into the next century. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1862 and received a royal medal in 1887. He was appointed CB in 1870, and served as a delegate to the International Geodetic Congress in 1883.<br>
<br>The pursuit of abstract science within the military was not without critics. When the War Office discovered in 1881 that Clarke had been at a home station for twenty-seven years, it ordered him to sever his connection with the Ordnance Survey and take up a post in Mauritius. Clarke was furious and retired. Despite protests, the official decision stood and the Ordnance Survey thus lost a man who might well have become director, and, with no one to replace him, the survey declined into scientific mediocrity. For his last three decades Clarke played no part in science or public affairs.<br>
<br>Clarke was a deeply religious man who enjoyed mathematics, music, and domestic life. In 1853 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of Major-General Matthew Charles Dixon of the Royal Engineers. Clarke usually worked at home, often with some of their numerous children (they had four sons, one of whom died in infancy, and nine daughters) playing in the same room. He died on 11 February 1914 at his home, Strathmore, West Street, Reigate, Surrey. A plaque at 21 Carlton Crescent, Southampton, commemorates his residence there from 1861 to 1881.<br>
