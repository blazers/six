<span class="headword">Denison,  (John) Evelyn</span>, Viscount Ossington  (1800&#150;1873), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the eldest of the nine sons of John Denison MP (1758?&#150;1820), of Ossington Hall, Nottinghamshire, and his second wife, Charlotte, daughter of Samuel Estwick MP. One of his sisters, Lucy, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17965/', "Charles Manners-Sutton")</script>, speaker of the House of Commons. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7486/', "Edward Denison (1801&#150;1854)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7492/', "Sir William Thomas Denison (1804&#150;1871)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7488/', "George Anthony Denison (1805&#150;1896)")</script>. He was born at Ossington on 27 January 1800, and was educated at Eton College from 1811 to 1817. He then went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in June 1823, MA in May 1828, and honorary DCL in June 1870. In July 1823 he entered parliament as one of the members for the borough of Newcastle under Lyme, and in the following year went on a lengthy tour through Canada and the United States, in company with lords Derby, Taunton, and Wharncliffe. At a by-election in December 1826 he was returned unopposed for Hastings. Though seen as a whig, his maiden speech opposed Lord John Russell's motion for parliamentary reform. On 2 May 1827 he was appointed one of the council of the duke of Clarence, the lord high admiral in Canning's administration. When Wellington became prime minister in 1828, Denison resigned the post and never again took office. On 14 July 1827 he married Lady Charlotte Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (1806&#150;1889), third daughter of William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, fourth duke of Portland, and his wife, Henrietta. At the general election of 1830 he unsuccessfully contested his old constituency of Newcastle under Lyme, and in November that year was defeated at the by-election at Liverpool consequent on Huskisson's death. At the general election of 1831 he was elected for both Liverpool and the then undivided county of Nottinghamshire, where his family had some, but not great, influence. He chose to sit for the latter, and in the two following parliaments of 1833 and 1835 was returned for South Nottinghamshire without opposition. He supported the reform bills of 1831&#150;2. Denison was a whiggish Liberal, and the chief influence in the constituency was the tory duke of Newcastle. In 1837 Denison did not contest the constituency, which returned two tories. After being out of the house for four years, he was returned unopposed at the general election of 1841 for the borough of Malton, which constituency he continued to represent in the two following parliaments of 1847 and 1852. In March 1857, the Newcastle influence having become more Liberal, he was elected without opposition for North Nottinghamshire, holding the seat until his retirement from the Commons. Denison played some part, but not a significant one, in the private and public business of the house, and it was with some surprise&#151;to himself as well as his contemporaries&#151;that Palmerston, on J. T. Delane's recommendation, suggested to him that he be the government's candidate for the speakership on the retirement of Charles Shaw Lefevre. He was unanimously elected on 30 April 1857 and sworn of the privy council on 1 May. Denison was three times re-elected to the chair unopposed, on 3 May 1859, 1 February 1866, and 10 December 1868.<br>
<br>Denison was fairly well regarded as speaker. A consolidator rather than an innovator (he prevented, for example, the introduction of printed notice of questions to ministers), he none the less defended the financial rights of the Commons against the Lords, deploring the latter's action in rejecting the bill of 1860 repealing the paper duty, and opposing the Lords' introduction of a financial provision into a divorce bill  (Laundy, 307). The tories in 1862 hoped he might be encouraged to retire and be replaced by Spencer Walpole. Denison was the last speaker to speak and vote in committee, and he voted against the government on the budget on 9 June 1870. He was a dignified speaker but was thought by contemporaries sometimes lacking in firmness. <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted on his death: &#145;On the occasions which called for his active interposition with the House we do not care to dwell&#146;  (Laundy, 310). Denison was a cultivated man who thought the speaker should have a general influence on national life: thus he sponsored the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span> on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (published in ten volumes between 1871 and 1881).<br>
<br>The fast pace of legislation in Gladstone's first government exhausted Denison and he retired in February 1872, being succeeded by H. B. W. Brand. Denison was created Viscount Ossington of Ossington on 13 February 1872, but declined the usual substantial speaker's pension on the grounds that he had &#145;a private fortune which will suffice, and for the few years of life that remain to me I should be happier in feeling that I am not a burden to my fellow-countrymen&#146;. Denison kept a discreet diary between 1857 and 1872, which shows him to have had an unsubtle but competent mind; it was published posthumously as <span class="italic">Notes from my Journal when Speaker of the House of Commons</span> (1900), edited by his widow. He was president of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1856&#150;7 and was a trustee of the British Museum from 1872. He died at Ossington Hall on 7 March 1873, aged seventy-three, and was buried on the 13th in the family vault there. He had no heir. His widow, on the death of her brother the fifth duke of Portland, succeeded to part of the Portland estates and in 1882 took the surname of Scott instead of Denison, leaving over &pound;400,000 when she died in 1889.<br>
