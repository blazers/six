<span class="headword">Adams,  William George Stewart</span>  (1874&#150;1966), <span class="occ">political scientist and college head</span>, was born on 8 November 1874 at Hamilton, Lanarkshire, the second son and youngest of the four children of John Adams, headmaster of St John's Grammar School, Hamilton, with Aberdonian farming ancestors, and his wife, Margaret, of Appin, daughter of John Stewart of Glasgow, cotton manufacturer. Often recalling his happy childhood in later years, Adams went to his father's school and to Glasgow University. There he won a first class in classics in 1897 and was awarded a Snell exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a second class in classical moderations (1898) and firsts in Greats (1900) and modern history (1901).<br>
<br>Adams became a tutor at Borough Road Training College, Isleworth, Middlesex (1901&#150;2), and in 1902 went as lecturer in economics to the University of Chicago, the start of his lifelong interest in America, which he often revisited. In 1903 he became lecturer in economics and secretary of university extension at Manchester University. In his early career the two major influences upon him were Samuel Augustus Barnett and Arthur Lionel Smith, but in 1905 he became superintendent of statistics and intelligence at the Irish department of agriculture and technical instruction in Dublin under Sir Horace Plunkett, who then became the dominant influence upon him, especially with his belief in rural smallholdings; in later years Plunkett's name often featured in Adams's speeches and casual remarks. In 1908 Adams married Muriel, daughter of William Lane, a Treasury solicitor, of Stonehurst, Killiney, co. Dublin; they had one son. In 1910 Adams was appointed lecturer in political science at Oxford, and his career prospered with the rapid growth in Oxford's politics teaching under the twin influences of the Rhodes scholars and the students of Ruskin College. His post became a readership later in the year, and in 1912 he became Gladstone professor. His chair was held at All Souls, and he continued in the post until elected the college's warden in 1933.<br>
<br>In 1911 Adams's Irish expertise led to his joining the committee advising the cabinet on Irish finance, and both then and later he promoted a federalism that still seemed the feasible and peaceful route towards an Irish settlement. 1914 must have been a busy year for him because in that year he launched three large projects. First, he published two businesslike and severely empirical chapters&#151;on trade and public administration&#151;in the British volume of the six-volume <span class="italic">Oxford Survey of the British Empire</span>, edited by A. J. Herbertson and O. J. R. Howarth. Second, he comprehensively surveyed United Kingdom library services for the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, whose publishable parts, again factual in approach and without comment, appeared in 1915 with a wealth of statistics largely designed to expose patchy regional library provision. Third, he founded and edited the <span class="italic">Political Quarterly</span>, whose eight issues before its demise in 1916 drew together practical and academic concerns in politics. It included articles by distinguished authors (Lindsay, Lewis Namier, and Arnold Toynbee), updates on current developments in government and international relations, and reviews of relevant books. Harold Laski in his inaugural lecture of 1926 still felt the need for such a journal, a need acknowledged when the new <span class="italic">Political Quarterly</span> was launched in 1931.<br>
<br>Adams's first two editorials sympathetically discussed Irish home rule, but his third (later published as a pamphlet) portrayed the war as &#145;first and foremost a struggle of freedom against militarism&#146;, with liberty as the source of peace and the unifying principle of the British empire. The war also prompted Adams's public commitment as editor to the advance of internationalism, and his editorial in May 1915 argued strongly for an all-party coalition, claiming that &#145;the danger of our type of constitution is the excess of party government&#146;. In the same year Adams joined the Ministry of Munitions, and through the influence of Thomas Jones was invited in December 1916 to join Lloyd George's personal secretariat, editing the reports of the war cabinet and serving until 1918 as one of the private secretaries to Lloyd George, whose courage and decisiveness he admired. At the general election of 1918 Adams turned down the chance of a couponed seat in the House of Commons, and in 1919 he returned to Oxford.<br>
<br>There, with his carefully prepared and lucid lectures, he did much to establish Oxford's new degree in politics, philosophy, and economics. He joined the royal commission on the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and played a full part in the university's life as a member of its hebdomadal council from 1912 to 1924 and as pro-vice-chancellor in 1939&#150;45. In 1919 he was prominent among the founders of the National Council of Social Service (now the National Council for Voluntary Organizations), and chaired it from 1920 to 1949. He was very active in the Oxford Preservation Trust, and for some years owned and ran a farm on Boars Hill which was progressive in its methods. He tried to keep alive Plunkett's spirit of co-operation, and was prominent among the founders of the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs, chairing it from 1928 to 1946. He was keen to encourage village halls, women's institutes, and rural crafts and industries. George Haynes, a close colleague in the National Council, recalled &#145;the noble head on robust shoulders, the deep melodious voice ringing across the conference hall, the firm friendly handshake for friends and strangers alike, the strong, kindly gaze both compelling and reassuring&#146;  (<span class="italic">Social Service Quarterly</span>, 136), and spoke of Adams's lifelong enthusiasm and taste for human idiosyncrasy which led him to &#145;discover&#146; people wherever he went.<br>
<br>In 1933 Adams was elected warden of All Souls. In that role he was personally modest but showed a firm grasp of practical issues requiring decision, and encouraged groups to meet in the college to discuss public issues. Among the most important of these was the &#145;All Souls group&#146;, which from June 1941 brought together experts on educational matters. Adams was appointed Companion of Honour in 1936. On retiring from All Souls in 1945 Adams and his wife went to live in Donegal, where he took an active interest in Magee University College, Londonderry. His wife died in 1956 and Adams died at Fahan House, co. Donegal, on 30 January 1966.<br>
<br>Contemporaries often remarked upon Adams's impartiality, public spirit, optimism, and friendliness&#151;qualities which equipped him to draw people together for shared purposes but which left posterity with a somewhat colourless image, especially as his few publications are not self-revealing. Yet Adams was widely trusted in high circles, and there is a fourfold context in which it is possible to comprehend a career now no longer feasible: the unashamed dominance of liberal-minded and rational debate within an intellectual &eacute;lite with close links to Whitehall and Westminster; the vitality of a Liberal Party whose yoking of intellectuals, subordinate nationalities, and organized labour created a powerful progressive machine; the widespread belief in &#145;citizenship&#146; as a set of voluntarist and rationalistic attitudes transitional between an individualist religious idealism and a secular and collectivist professionalism; and an academic world where respect was won from colleagues less through prolific publication than through displaying wisdom in informal debate. As George Haynes (who had reason to know) pointed out, Adams's &#145;most natural medium of communication was through the spoken word, and that is perhaps why so many persons, eminent or unknown, came to him for help and advice&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
