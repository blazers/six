<span class="headword">Garnett,  (William) John Poulton Maxwell</span>  (1921&#150;1997), <span class="occ">industrial relations officer</span>, was born on 6 August 1921 in Hampstead, London, into the family of four sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33333/', "(James Clerk) Maxwell Garnett (1880&#150;1958)")</script>, educationist and peace campaigner, and his wife, Margaret Lucy (1887&#150;1965), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35586/', "Sir Edward Bagnall Poulton")</script>, Hope professor of zoology at Oxford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45538/', "William Garnett")</script>, physicist and educational administrator, was his paternal grandfather, and Margaret Christian (Peggy) Jay (<i>d</i>. 1996), first wife of Douglas Patrick Thomas Jay, Baron Jay, politician, was the eldest of his three sisters. He was educated at Rugby School and at Kent School in the USA before becoming an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1940. In 1941 he volunteered to join the Royal Navy and served briefly as a rating on the battleship <i>Malaya</i>. He was asked to volunteer for special service and joined the inshore patrol as a lieutenant. The patrol was engaged in difficult and dangerous work, taking agents and supplies to and fro across the English Channel. These experiences introduced him to the problems and opportunities of leadership, to which he was to devote the rest of his life. On 7 April 1943 he married (Kathleen) Barbara Rutherford Smith (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), schoolteacher, daughter of Reginald Rutherford Smith, medical practitioner. There were two sons and two daughters of the marriage, including Virginia (<i>b</i>. 1948), who in 1967 married Peter Bottomley and was secretary of state for health (1992&#150;5) and for national heritage (1995&#150;7). After the war Garnett returned to Cambridge and was awarded an upper second-class degree in economics. He then joined Imperial Chemical Industries in Glasgow as a clerk, and in due course was promoted to be personnel manager at their plastics factory in Blackpool. For a short time he was in charge of the communications unit at the head office in London.<br>
<br>In 1962 Garnett became director of the Industrial Welfare Society (later renamed the Industrial Society). The society provided him with the platform and opportunity he needed. For twenty-five years he developed the style, the ideas, and the convictions which influenced so many managers and supervisors throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In the words of one observer, &#145;he lit a torch for management&#146;. The Industrial Society proved to be the ideal vehicle for the propagation of his ideas about management and industrial relations, which, although not entirely original, were innovatory at the time. When he joined as director 48 staff were employed with a turnover of &pound;165,000; in 1986, when he retired, 380 staff managed a &pound;10 million turnover. He was appointed CBE in 1970.<br>
<br>Garnett's messages were simple, clear, direct, and forceful. He believed in managers &#145;walking the job&#146;, and communicating regularly through &#145;team briefings&#146; in groups with no more than fifteen people. He emphasized the accountability of leaders for involving people in their work. He hated waste of any kind&#151;by which he meant the underutilization of people's skills and experience. He had a special regard for the role and function of the supervisor, whose importance he never forgot. All this and more he set out in detail in his book <span class="italic">The Work Challenge</span> (1973) and summarized on a plastic card listing leadership action points. In his own words:<blockquote>the leader's job is to call forth the gifts of people and help them to work for a common task &hellip; A crucial function of the leader is to take decisions. It is not just a question of taking the best decision but also taking it in a way which will obtain the best possible cooperation of the people who have to carry it out &hellip; We shall fulfil our place in history if we carry out the common sense actions contained in this book with courage, humility and hope. (Garnett, <span class="italic">The Work Challenge</span>, 1973, 11, 53, 105)</blockquote>All along Garnett was driven by his Christian faith and by his belief in the ability of the individual.<br>
<br>Garnett was a handsome man with a classical profile and a shock of unruly hair which in later life was still present, though white. He held his audiences by the force and charm of his personality and the appeal of his ideas. At conferences he could be relied on to inspire and energize the participants. There were many firms and individuals who had reason to be grateful to him. Throughout a life of exceptional commitment, he proclaimed tirelessly the significance and importance of work in industry and commerce. Essentially an evangelical Christian, he was a crusader for the causes and the messages he believed in. He was a passionate man with strong yet practical ideas, which he expressed in thousands of speeches he made throughout the country. Both during his working life and in retirement he was asked to serve on many public bodies. He was a member of the Wilberforce inquiry into the miners' strike in 1972; arbitrator for a long-running Transport and General Workers' Union lorry drivers' strike in 1979; a member of the Churches' Council on Gambling (chair 1965&#150;71); and chair of the West Lambeth Health Authority from 1986 to 1990 (being largely responsible for saving St Thomas's Hospital).<br>
<br>Garnett's first marriage was dissolved in 1985, and on 2 April that year he married Julia Charity (<i>b</i>. 1950), industrial relations officer, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40154/', "(Thomas) Douglas James Cleverdon")</script>, BBC producer and publisher, and former wife of Martin Christopher Ollard. She had joined the Industrial Society in 1975, and was head of its common purpose campaign from 1977 to 1979, director of its communications and publicity division from 1979 to 1981, and founding head of its Pepperell department for inner cities and education work from 1981 to 1988; she was subsequently chief executive of Business in the Community from 1992. There were two daughters of this second marriage. With his second family Garnett continued to enjoy holidays on the Isle of Wight, where he was able to indulge his passion for sailing, and where he had built with his own hands a house (Stone House) and a Greek amphitheatre. In later life he became a regular visitor to the Greek islands, where he died on holiday on 14 August 1997. He was survived by his second wife and his six children. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 4 December 1997.<br>
