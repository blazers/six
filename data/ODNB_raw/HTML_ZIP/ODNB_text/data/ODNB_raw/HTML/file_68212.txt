<span class="headword">Walker,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was baptized on 2 April 1622 at Conington, Cambridgeshire, the son of William Walker (<i>fl</i>. 1610&#150;1660), a clergyman. While it is possible that his mother was Mary Bois (<i>bap</i>. 1599, <i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of the biblical scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2780/', "John Bois")</script>, of whom Walker wrote a brief life, it is more likely that she was his stepmother. Smith suggests she and Walker married in 1618, but a date of 1629 has also been recorded. Walker was educated in Ely, and (from 1638) at St John's College, Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1642 and MA in 1645. He was incorporated at Oxford in 1657. Ordained in 1644, Walker was appointed as tutor to the stepdaughter of John Gauden in the same year, and Walker also assisted Gauden in his parochial duties at Bocking, Essex. About 1647 Walker became domestic chaplain to the principal patron of East Anglian puritanism, Robert Rich, earl of Warwick, at Lees, Essex. He was intimate with Mary Rich, who described him as &#145;Good natured&#146; and an &#145;Ingenious persone&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27357, fols. 22&#150;3). In 1650 Walker was appointed rector of Fyfield, Essex, a living in the disposal of the Rich family. He continued as a spiritual mainstay of the Rich household, providing fellowship and funeral sermons when required. On 22 July 1650 Walker married Elizabeth Sadler [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66719/', "Walker, Elizabeth (1623&#150;1690)")</script>], with whom he had eleven children, all of whom predeceased him. Walker edited her vivid autobiography as <span class="italic">The Holy Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker</span> (1690).<br>
<br>Walker welcomed the Restoration, his first published work being a sermon on the occasion. He petitioned Charles II to enable him to receive the degree of DD from Cambridge, from which he had been debarred during the interregnum. In 1662 he conformed to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, and he remained as incumbent of Fyfield until his death. Additionally he was perpetual curate of St Mary Aldermanbury, London, from 1664 to 1666, and from 1690 to 1691. Owing to the poor health of his wife he became a regular visitor to Tunbridge Wells, where he appears to have occasionally preached. Two of these sermons were published in his <span class="italic">Fax fonte accensa</span> (1684), which also included meditations &#145;for the use of those who attend the Mineral Waters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fax fonte accensa</span>, sig. A9<i>r</i>). In 1685 Walker suffered some form of persecution for ten days, perhaps on political grounds: he obliquely refers to being the victim of &#145;spightful Malice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holy Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker</span>, 133). Palgrave alleges that Walker was imprisoned at Tilbury. Walker concurred with the revolution of 1688&#150;9, seeing it as an opportunity for national reformation, as he suggested in <span class="italic">The True Interest of Nations Impartially Stated</span>, his Chelmsford assize sermon of 1691. Elizabeth Walker died on 23 February 1690 and on 21 September of the following year Walker married Margaret Masham (<i>d</i>. 1730) of Oates, Essex, possibly the sister-in-law of Damaris Masham. Walker was dead by 18 April 1692, and was probably buried on that date at Fyfield. He endowed the village with several charities. Josiah Woodward, another spiritual reformer of the 1690s, preached his funeral sermon at Fyfield on 18 April.<br>
<br>Of his eleven published works Walker is remembered for <span class="italic">A True Account of the Author of a Book Entituled Eikon basilike</span> (1692). Here he defended himself from Richard Hollingworth, who had attacked Walker for his belief that it was John Gauden, rather than Charles I, who was author of the <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>. Walker reiterated his claim, and told how Gauden had discussed the work with him and had claimed that the royal family knew about Gauden's role in the work's composition. Gauden also showed Walker the manuscript, which Walker himself claimed to have delivered to be printed in London in December 1648. The <span class="italic">True Account</span> ignited a pamphlet war which raged throughout the 1690s, but Walker himself took no further part in it, having died while the <span class="italic">True Account</span> was in publication.<br>
