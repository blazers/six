<span class="headword">Dyer,  John</span>  (1653/4&#150;1713), <span class="occ">newsletter writer</span>, is of unknown origins. By 1688 he was known as a coffee-house keeper in Whitefriars, London, and as the publisher of a manuscript newsletter, the circulation of which was estimated by Sir Roger L'Estrange to be about &#145;five hundred copies &hellip; spread over the kingdom&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 41805, fol. 93).<br>
<br>Dyer's newswriting operation was a substantial one: he may well have employed as many as fifty scribes to work for his news scriptorium and he was producing perhaps 500 copies thrice weekly. His news circulated throughout the British Isles and on the European continent as well. Dyer often managed to take advantage of the franking privileges of members of parliament in order to have his newsletters circulate postage-free throughout the kingdom. Dyer's news may also have been read aloud in groups in the countryside, if Joseph Addison's satire on the practice in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> is to be believed.<br>
<br>Dyer's news was also highly controversial. Manuscript news, unlike printed newspapers, was unlicensed in later Stuart England and thus offered a more convenient medium for more politically partisan or critical commentary than that which was normally found in printed newspapers like the official <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>.<br>
<br>Dyer's decidedly partisan support for tory politics and his willingness to offer critical reflections upon government office-holders often incurred the wrath of state officials, especially whigs. He quickly gained a reputation for being a Jacobite, or at least a crypto-Jacobite sympathizer, but no concrete positive evidence of Dyer's Jacobitism has been uncovered and it is likely that the accusations of disloyalty levied against him were attempts by whiggishly inclined writers to further smear his reputation.<br>
<br>Many of Dyer's customers clearly cherished his news and thought it well worth preserving. Many of the news items from Dyer's letters made their way into the notes of contemporary events made by Narcissus Luttrell, published in 1857 as his <span class="italic">Brief Historical Relation of State Affairs</span>. The papers of the Oxford antiquary Thomas Hearne also contain many items derived from Dyer.<br>
<br>Dyer seemed to take great pleasure in evading the numerous attempts by royal messengers of the press to apprehend him. Even after depositing four sureties to guarantee his appearance for prosecution at the sessions in autumn of 1693, Dyer continued to write and publish newsletters that denigrated the war efforts of William III. By the time he made an appearance before the magistrates at the Old Bailey, Dyer had racked up three indictments against himself for his newswriting, and although he briefly tried to escape his punishment by making an escape and living undercover, he was ultimately convicted and fined 80 marks. By September 1694, while he was still bound under his recognizance for further good behaviour, Dyer was again facing prosecution for his satiric jibes against the government in his newsletters. He was tried again for publishing false news, this time while kept under armed guard to prevent further escape attempts. The prosecutors wanted to obtain a judgment ordering Dyer to refrain from writing news ever again, but they ultimately failed to obtain a conviction due to lack of evidence. In December 1694 Dyer was also called before the House of Commons to be prosecuted for breach of parliamentary privilege by presuming to report upon their proceedings in his newsletters. He was fined for his transgression, but he was hardly chastened by the experience.<br>
<br>As silencing Dyer through direct prosecution failed to stop his pen, alternative means of shutting him up were tried. Several coffee-house keepers who subscribed to Dyer's newsletter service were prosecuted at the London Old Bailey sessions in September and again in October 1695. The prosecution in both cases was successful and on each occasion two of the coffee men were fined. Later in the year Dyer himself was again apprehended, but he seems to have escaped once more and he remained at large until April 1697, when he was taken once more into custody by the serjeant-at-arms for the House of Commons. Seemingly unperturbed by his travails, Dyer was yet again taken into custody in September 1699.<br>
<br>Dyer remained unruffled by this harassment and he continued to supply the coffee houses with his newsletters in Queen Anne's reign, despite continued attempts to suppress his newswriting generally and to prosecute him specifically. When the earl of Godolphin, lord treasurer, received a complaint from the duchess of Marlborough about Dyer's report that the second earl of Sunderland had died a Roman Catholic in October 1702, Godolphin replied to her wearily that many previous attempts to suppress Dyer's writings had been failures &#145;and still the consequence of it has been that his letters have been more sought after than they were before&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Marlborough&#150;Godolphin Correspondence</span>, ed. H. L. Snyder, 3 vols., 1975, 1.125). A warrant for Dyer's arrest was issued in March 1703. Charles, Lord Mohun, took a more direct approach in December 1694 when he encountered Dyer in person at his coffee house and presented Dyer with a copy of a newsletter in which he had been named. Mohun then &#145;immediately laid him on with a cudgel he had provided for that purpose, and made him swear to have no more say of the Lord Mohun&#146;  (Oldmixon, 95). Dyer met much the same treatment at the hands of an angry sea captain in January 1705 when he was discovered by the seaman at Man's Coffee House.<br>
<br>A few furtive attempts were made by local magistrates and press messengers to silence Dyer's newsletters in Queen Anne's reign but not on the scale seen in the preceding decades and to no avail. Dyer died on 6 September 1713 in the parish of St Bride, Fleet Street, London. He was probably married, as he had two sons, Thomas Dyer and John Dyer.<br>
<br>As late as 1716&#151;nearly twenty-eight years after Dyer began writing his newsletters and indeed almost three years after the death of Dyer himself&#151;Addison, a whig, still complained that Dyer's newsletters misled the public, especially those in the countryside. Dyer's readers, Addison thought, remained obstinately ignorant of the official news found in the printed newspapers since they still preferred to rely upon Dyer's handwritten, and decidedly high tory version of the news. The tory newsletter genre that Dyer made his own persisted well after his death and was imitated by other scribal journalists like George Dormer.<br>
