<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, fourth duke of Queensberry  (1725&#150;1810), <span class="occ">sybarite and politician</span>, only son of William Douglas, second earl of March (<i>c</i>.1696&#150;1731), and his wife, Anne Hamilton, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Ruglen (1698&#150;1748), was born on 16 December 1725 at Queensberry Lodging, Peebles. He succeeded his father as earl of March in 1731 and was known by that title until succeeding his father's first cousin as duke of Queensberry in 1778. The latter also acted as March's guardian after the second earl's death on 7 March 1731, and was instrumental in the decision to educate him at Winchester College, which he attended from 1735 to 1740. He succeeded to the earldom of Ruglen on his mother's death on 21 April 1748.<br>
<br>After reaching his majority, March settled in London and dedicated himself to the pursuit of pleasure in a variety of forms. By the time he became heir to the third duke of Queensberry in 1756, he had established himself as a leading man about town. Lady Louisa Stuart noted that by then he was:<blockquote>the most fashionable, most dissipated young man in London, the leading character at Newmarket, the support of the gaming table, the supreme dictator of the Opera-house, the pattern whose dress and equipage were to be copied by all who aimed at distinction and &hellip; the person most universally admired by the ladies. (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, l.lxxiii)</blockquote>No crude sensualist, March was a man of discerning taste and common sense who single-mindedly devoted himself to whatever interested him.<br>
<br>Admitted to the young club at White's in 1747, March soon became known as an active and successful gambler. His reputation soared after the &#145;chaise match&#146; in 1750 in which he and the earl of Eglinton bet Theodore Taafe and Andrew Sproule 1000 guineas that a carriage could carry a passenger 19 miles in one hour. March arranged for the construction of a skeletal vehicle of lightweight materials that barely fitted the definition of a carriage and trained horses specially to pull it. The trial was held at Newmarket, and March's vehicle completed the 19 miles in under fifty-four minutes. As in much of his gaming, March shrewdly assessed the variables before committing to the wager and stretched the terms of the bet to his advantage. He seldom risked more than he was prepared to lose and manifested a degree of self-control that often eluded his fellow gamblers.<br>
<br>Success in the match was facilitated by March's expert knowledge of horses. He had run his first horses at Newmarket in 1748&#151;winning three out of three races. Five years later he bought a house overlooking the racecourse. Though not a charter member of the Jockey Club, he was an early recruit and influential member. He was a careful breeder of horses and occasionally rode himself in the crimson colours that marked his stable. One of the turf's most successful and visible patrons, he continued to run horses until his eighty-first year.<br>
<br>Another passion was music. A founder member of the Catch Club in 1762, March became better known as a patron of the opera. He continued to attend the latter, according to Nathaniel Wraxall, even after losing much of his hearing in order to gratify &#145;his wish of being still seen upon the great arena of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 4.359). To contemporaries, March's musical interests seemed keyed more to opera singers and ballet dancers, and some of his better-known mistresses, such as Teresina Tondino and Anna Zamparini, were divas.<br>
<br>Indeed it was as a pursuer and seducer of the opposite sex that March would be most remembered. He had a long string of mistresses, whom he neither flaunted nor concealed. Despite his lecherous reputation, he was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors in the kingdom, especially after he became heir to the Queensberry title and estates. Though often rumoured to be on the verge of marriage, he successfully eluded all attempts to get him to the altar and died unmarried. He was probably the father of at least one daughter (with the Marchesa Fagnani). The child, Maria Emily Fagnani, familiarly known as Mie-Mie (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42344/', "Maria Emily Seymour-Conway, marchioness of Hertford")</script>) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25167/', "Conway, Francis Ingram-Seymour-, second marquess of Hertford")</script>], was raised largely by his best friend, George Selwyn, and in 1798 married the heir of the marquess of Hertford.<br>
<br>Though his career as a pleasure-seeker tended to predominate in the public mind, March was also a figure of at least middling importance in politics. His paternal inheritance gave him the dominant parliamentary influence in Peeblesshire and as heir to the dukedom of Queensberry he gained a similar influence in Dumfriesshire and a less commanding interest in Dumfries burghs. He generally followed the lead of the third duke of Queensberry during the 1750s, becoming associated with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96922', "Leicester House")</script> group clustered around the prince of Wales. On the latter's accession, as George III, March was named a lord of the bedchamber and elected a representative peer in 1761. Honours and sinecures followed: knight of the Thistle (1763), vice-admiral of Scotland (1766&#150;76), and first lord of police (1776&#150;82). In 1763 he played a role in the prosecution of John Wilkes when his chaplain, the Revd John Kidgell, helped the government obtain a copy of Wilkes's privately printed poem &#145;Essay on Woman&#146;.<br>
<br>As a representative peer March was more regular than most in attending the House of Lords but sought no reputation as a speaker. He usually supported the ministry of the day, though in 1766 he opposed the first Rockingham administration on the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, and in December 1783 opposed by proxy the Fox&#150;North coalition's <span class="roman">India Bill</span>. He was in many ways a nominal Scot. Usually voting in peers' elections by sealed list, he attended in person only in 1747, 1761, and 1784, and generally spent little time in Scotland. In 1786 he was created a British peer as Baron Douglas of Amesbury. In 1789 he made the major political miscalculation of his career when he backed the prince of Wales and voted against William Pitt on the regency question, the only lord of the bedchamber to do so. He approached the issue as he would a prospective wager and had obtained from the king's doctor an opinion that a recovery was unlikely. When the king's health did improve, Queensberry was dismissed and subjected to much criticism. He tried unsuccessfully to make amends with the king and thereafter ceased to be a prominent figure at court. In the 1790s he frequently offered hospitality to aristocratic refugees from the French Revolution. In 1794 he became lord lieutenant of Dumfriesshire when that office was revived for Scottish counties.<br>
<br>Already comfortably off, on the inheritance of the Queensberry estates in 1778 (said to be worth &pound;18,000 a year) the duke became one of the richest men in the kingdom. As he grew older, his actions brought increasing notoriety and criticism. To some, perhaps, he was emblematic of aristocratic licence, to others merely a dirty old man. He was often referred to as Old Q, his continued pursuit of young women grist to the mill of caricaturists and salacious biographers. His decision to cut down large stands of timber on his Scottish estates provoked the ire of major poets. Thus Burns concluded his &#145;Verses on the Destruction of the Woods Near Drumlanrig&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>The worm that gnaw'd my bonnie trees,<br>
</div>
<div>That reptile wears a ducal crown.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Wordsworth reacted: &#145;Degenerate Douglas! Oh, the unworthy lord!&#146;  (Blyth, 184&#150;5). None of this bothered Queensberry, who remained contemptuous of public opinion. He did enjoy seeing and being seen, however, and fitted a balcony to his Piccadilly house so that he might watch the traffic below. Among other things he interested himself in underwriting the defence of Sir Thomas Picton, accused of brutality as governor of Trinidad. Prior to his death, the prospective disposition of his estate occasioned much speculation. He continued to add codicils to his will (twenty-five in all) until his death on 23 December 1810 at 138 Piccadilly, London. According to Wraxall he was then worth &pound;900,000. He made numerous bequests and was notably generous to his male servants, though the largest share of his estate went to his natural daughter. He was buried on 31 December at St James's, Piccadilly, under the communion table.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most remarkable feature of Queensberry's career is that despite slender contributions to public life, he has remained a subject of popular interest. Refuting the obituary prediction of the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> that because he had &#145;fulfilled none of the present duties of society, self-preservation only excepted&#146;, his name would be forgotten by all but his legatees and racing aficionados  (Melville, 15), he has remained in the popular mind one of the best-known of eighteenth-century peers. He has been the subject of three serious biographies since the late nineteenth century, a statement that cannot be made about many of his noble contemporaries.<br>
