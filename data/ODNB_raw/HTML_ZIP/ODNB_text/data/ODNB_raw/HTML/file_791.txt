<span class="headword">Ashwood,  John</span>  (1657&#150;1706), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/790/', "Bartholomew Ashwood (1622&#150;1678)")</script>, was born in Axminster, Devon, where his father was vicar. His mother may have been Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1710), the wife who outlived Bartholomew. After a &#145;remarkable&#146; conversion at the age of fourteen, he was admitted to his father's Independent church at Axminster  (Reynolds, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 60). He proceeded to Newington Green, near London, where he studied under Theophilus Gale. Before 1678 he returned to teach at a school and preach with his father at Axminster and at nearby Chard, Somerset. He preached publicly even in the &#145;darkest times&#146; and though the magistrates attempted to silence him, they could never convict him  (ibid., 104). The persecution intensified, however, and Ashwood and some friends determined to emigrate to Carolina in January 1684, but an attack of smallpox prevented him from leaving. Like many Axminster dissenters he joined the Monmouth rebels in 1685, for which he was arrested and sentenced to death, though ultimately pardoned. He then preached at various places in southern Somerset, including Ilminster, Weston in the parish of Combe St Nicholas, and Buckland. Not until 1689, when the Independent church at Castle Lane, Exeter, invited him to settle as pastor, was he ordained. He remained for almost a decade, during which time he attempted to co-operate with the presbyterian-dominated Exeter Assembly, though relations soon deteriorated. The insistence of Ashwood and his fellow congregationalist Stephen Towgood on ordaining men without the consent of the assembly offended their brethren and threatened to re-open fundamental denominational differences which still existed over church government. Ashwood suffered perpetual financial difficulties which grants from the London Common Fund and the Congregational Fund could not relieve. Struggling to support his wife and seven young daughters, he moved to London by 1698. Nothing more is known of his family, save that his wife died shortly after their arrival in London. He preached at Hoxton and Spitalfields before accepting a call from a congregation at Peckham, Surrey, about 1700.<br>
<br>Ashwood is chiefly known for the posthumous account of his life written by Thomas Reynolds, which long remained a favourite among nonconformist readers. Reynolds, the Independent minister at the Weigh House, Little East Cheap, endeavoured to show that, despite his obscurity, Ashwood's life was marked by a quiet yet heroic piety. Ashwood diligently served his flock, worshipped God in his closet and family, and recorded God's dealings with him in a diary. Naturally melancholy, he became increasingly discouraged that his preaching made no discernible impact on his people, and concluded his ministry a failure. Appended to the <span class="italic">Account</span> (1707) are two sermons addressed to &#145;fatherless children&#146;, preached to his old hearers at Axminster a few months before he died. After a final sermon delivered to his former congregation in Exeter, he returned to Peckham, died on 22 September 1706, and was buried at Camberwell, Surrey.<br>
