<span class="headword">Christie,  John Reginald Halliday</span>  (1899&#150;1953), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born on 8 April 1899 at his parents' home, Black Boy House, near Halifax. He was the sixth child in the family of two sons and five daughters of Ernest John Christie, carpet designer, and his wife, Mary Hannah Halliday. He won a scholarship to Halifax secondary school, sang in the church choir, and became a boy scout. In later life he said that he was terrified of his father and found his mother over-possessive. He served in the First World War in the 52nd Nottinghamshire and Derby regiment, and in France he was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) regiment as a signalman. After the war, in which he was gassed, he returned to Halifax and in 1920 married a typist, Ethel Simpson (<i>d</i>. 1952). They had no children. Between 1921 and 1933 Christie served a number of prison sentences for theft and, on one occasion, assault.<br>
<br>In 1937 the Christies moved into the ground-floor flat of 10 Rillington Place (demolished) in west London, where Christie found employment as a cinema manager. During the Second World War, despite his criminal record, he became a war reserve policeman and won two commendations.<br>
<br>In 1948 an illiterate van driver, Timothy Evans, who was twenty-three, and his pregnant wife, Beryl, moved into the upstairs flat. In 1949 Beryl found that she was pregnant again, but did not want a second child. Christie offered to abort the baby, impressing the Evanses with his first-aid certificates. Later, Christie told Evans that the abortion had failed and that his wife had died. He warned Evans that they were both guilty of a criminal offence, and advised him to leave London; Christie would dispose of Beryl's body and have the baby, Geraldine, adopted. Evans agreed.<br>
<br>Eventually Evans went to the police, who found the strangled bodies of Beryl and Geraldine in Christie's wash-house. Evans was brought to London, where, after interrogation, he signed a confession to both the murders, which he later retracted. At his trial Christie was the chief prosecution witness. The jury did not believe Evans's story about his wife's abortion, as there was no evidence of it. Evans was found guilty and hanged for the murder of his daughter in March 1950, protesting his innocence to the last.<br>
<br>In 1953 Christie left 10 Rillington Place. Shortly afterwards a number of bodies were found buried on the premises, in the garden, in an alcove behind the kitchen, and under the sitting-room floorboards. They were identified as those of Ruth Fuerst, an Austrian nurse, who had been missing since 1943; Muriel Eady, who had been one of Christie's colleagues at work in 1944; Christie's wife; and three other female victims, two of whom were prostitutes. All had been strangled, and according to Christie all except his wife had been subjected to sexual assault at or just after the time of death.<br>
<br>Christie was convicted of murder and hanged at Pentonville prison, London, on 15 July 1953. The case aroused public disquiet as demonstrating that Evans's conviction and execution had been miscarriages of justice; there were two inquiries, and after the second Evans was granted a posthumous free pardon. The matter played an important part in the subsequent abolition of the death penalty in Britain; it was depicted in the film <span class="italic">Ten Rillington Place</span> (1971).<br>
