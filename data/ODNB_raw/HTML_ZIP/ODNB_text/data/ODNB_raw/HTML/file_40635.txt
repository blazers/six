<span class="headword">Little <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Richmond]</span>,  Janet</span>  (1759&#150;1813), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Nether Bogside, Dumfriesshire, the daughter of George Little; though her exact birth date is unknown, she was baptized on 13 August 1759. Very little is known about her childhood, although her earliest biographer stated&#151;possibly on the evidence of her later career as a poet&#151;that &#145;she was early distinguished for her superior capacity and love of reading&#146;  (Paterson, 79). She went into service when still very young, perhaps acquiring some education while with an early employer, the Revd Mr Johnstone. In 1788 she sought a place with Frances Dunlop of Dunlop, one of the patrons and correspondents of Robert Burns. Little was sent to Loudoun Castle, which had been rented in 1789 by Susan Henrie, one of Mrs Dunlop's daughters, where she was responsible for supervising the dairy. She had presumably become interested in the work of Burns while with Mrs Dunlop and, in 1789, she sent him some of her poems. Burns was slow and cool in his response, apparently choosing to send his reply to Mrs Dunlop rather than Little herself. (If he did write directly to Little, the letter has been lost.) Hilton Brown has explained this coolness by suggesting that Burns might have found Little's writing a somewhat &#145;disquieting imitation&#146; of his own work  (Brown, 15); certainly Little herself saw Burns as both a model and an inspiration. She apparently called on him in January 1791&#151;unluckily arriving just before Burns was brought home with a broken arm following a riding accident&#151;and then commemorated the occasion in a rather breathless poem:<blockquote>
<div>Is't true? or does some magic spell<br>
</div>
<div>My wondr'ing eyes beguile?<br>
</div>
<div>Is this the place where deigns to dwell<br>
</div>
<div>The honour of our isle?<br>
</div> (Little, 111)</blockquote>There is no independent reference to Little's presence in Burns's household on that day, however, and at least one critic has &#145;speculate[d that] the encounter may be imagined&#146;  (Bold, 25).<br>
<br>Little published a collection of her poems in 1792, describing herself in the title as the Scotch Milkmaid. Dedicated to the eleven-year-old countess of Loudoun, the volume was published by subscription and seems to have been moderately successful, reportedly earning the author &pound;50. According to the subscription list Little sold nearly 800 copies to just over 650 subscribers, among whom were Burns and James Boswell. In a poetic dedication Little described herself as &#145;[a] rustic damsel&#146; who hopes that &#145;public candour&#146; will rescue her work from the attacks of &#145;snarling critic[s]&#146;  (Little, 25&#150;6). She experimented with a variety of poetic forms and wrote in both Scots and standard English; she tended to adhere rather more closely to conventional eighteenth-century subjects (&#145;To Hope&#146;, &#145;To Happiness&#146;) in her English verse than she did when writing in Scots. The volume also gives some evidence of her reading; in addition to the tributes to Burns there is a poem on the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Elizabeth Rowe, in which Little imagines &#145;MONTAGUE bright&#146; praising Rowe for transcending her in &#145;virtue and wit&#146;  (Little, 154). In another, &#145;To a Lady&#146;, on the works of David Sillars, a working-class poet for whom Little had nothing but contempt, she writes:<blockquote>
<div>[L]est with such dunces as these I be number'd,<br>
</div>
<div>Tho' pen, ink and paper, are by me in store<br>
</div>
<div>O madam excuse, for I ne'er shall write more.<br>
</div> (Little, 207)</blockquote>Despite this proclamation, in the last lines of Little's only published collection of verse, she did write more; in 1840 James Paterson concluded his brief account of her life by reprinting some poems which had remained in manuscript until then.<br>
<br>After Mrs Henrie left Loudoun Castle, Little stayed on, continuing to run the dairy; on 14 December 1792 she married John Richmond (<i>c</i>.1741&#150;1819), a widower with five children. Paterson describes Richmond as a labourer on the Loudoun estate; little else is known about either Richmond or the marriage, except that Little is said to have been a kind stepmother. Paterson preserves a few anecdotes about her later life, related by a Mr Blackwood, the dissenting minister whose church she attended. According to Blackwood, Little's memory was so remarkable that she was able to point out a skipped sentence when she heard, for the second time, a sermon which he had read at another church a few weeks earlier. More generally, he remembered her as being &#145;greatly beloved in the neighbourhood, and enjoy[ing] a high character for piety and rectitude of conduct&#146;  (Paterson, 88). Little remained at Loudoun Castle until her death from &#145;a cramp in the stomach&#146; on 15 March 1813; she was buried in the cemetery at Loudoun kirk  (Paterson, 89). Her association with Burns has prevented her work from being forgotten as completely as that of some of her contemporaries, such as the Aberdeen poet Christian Milne, but she was rarely seen as anything more than a footnote in Burns studies during the nineteenth, and most of the twentieth, centuries. Hilton Brown, for example, writing about her in 1950, thought the best that could be said of her writing was that it &#145;could have been &hellip; much worse&#146;  (Brown, 17). In the 1990s, however, renewed interest in working-class writing led to some re-evaluations of her work; in addition, one critic has argued strongly that reading Little only through Burns obscures the range of her work and that she ought to be read in the larger Scots &#145;vernacular tradition of Ramsay and Ferguson&#146;  (Bold, 21).<br>
