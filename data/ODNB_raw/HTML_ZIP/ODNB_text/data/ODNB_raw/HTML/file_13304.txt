<span class="headword">Hill,  Edmund</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Thomas of St Gregory]</span>  (1564&#150;1644), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born in Somerset on 24 June 1564, the son of Thomas and Joan Hill. He is sometimes said to have been a Church of England clergyman but this is unlikely in the light of his own avowal that &#145;I was born, baptized and confirmed a Catholic&#146;  (Hill, <span class="italic">Quartron of Reasons</span>, 1600, preface). He was a servant of John Gerard, the Jesuit, who sent him to the English College of Douai, then temporarily removed to Rheims, on 21 August 1590. He left for Rome on 16 February 1593, continued his studies in the English College there, and was ordained priest on 12 March 1594 by Owen Lewis, bishop of Cassano. He was the chief troublemaker in the student uprising against the administration of the English College at Rome by the Jesuits, with their pro-Spanish sympathies. He earned sufficient notoriety in this role to receive a personal rebuke from Pope Clement VIII at the audience granted to him on his departure for the English mission.<br>
<br>Hill's youthful contentiousness now found a new outlet in religious controversy. On 18 January 1599 William Pole, a Devonshire justice of the peace, denounced him to Pole's grandfather, Sir John Popham, the lord chief justice, for having &#145;corrupted and seduced&#146; Sir Robert Basset. Pole claimed to have written to the same effect in 1597. This accusation shows that Hill's first missionary field was his native west country. His <span class="italic">A Quartron of Reasons of Catholic Religion with as many Brief Reasons of Refusal</span> was published secretly in England in 1600, bearing the imprint &#145;Antwerp&#146;. This challenge elicited two responses, the first in 1603 from Francis Dillingham, one of the translators of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. A weightier response of 438 pages from George Abbot, dean of Winchester and future archbishop of Canterbury, appeared in 1604. Abbot spent a year and a half on its composition even though he dismissed Hill's work as no more than an abridgement of a similar book by Richard Bristow, usually referred to as &#145;Bristow's motives&#146;. Hill wrote two other works of a devotional nature.<br>
<br>When Hill published his <span class="italic">Quartron</span> he was, according to his own account, &#145;living at Phalempyne, beyond the sea&#146;, being then a doctor of divinity. Two years later he was again labouring on the mission, and being apprehended at &#145;Dubscombte's house in London&#146; was committed to Newgate prison. A Jesuit recounting his capture described him as an &#145;appellant priest&#146;. On 30 April 1604 he was condemned to death for being a priest, but was reprieved at the intercession of the Spanish ambassador and banished in the following year. While in prison again in 1612 he received the Benedictine habit by commission from Leander of St Martin (John Jones). After his release he was professed a monk of St Gregory's Priory, Douai, on 8 October 1613, though he continued to work as a missioner in England where he laboured for nearly fifty years in all. In 1633 he was given the honorific title of prior of Gloucester by the English Benedictine congregation. On leaving the English mission he retired to St Gregory's at Douai, where he died on 7 August 1644.<br>
