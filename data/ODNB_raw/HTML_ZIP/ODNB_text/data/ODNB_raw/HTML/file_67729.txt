<span class="headword">Vyvyan,  Jennifer Brigit</span>  (1925&#150;1974), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 13 March 1925 at St Ives, Granville Road, Broadstairs, Kent, the daughter of Captain Cecil Albert Vyvyan, formerly of the Royal Engineers, and his wife, Brigit Maria Stokes. She was educated at St Paul's Girls' School and at Talbot Heath, Bournemouth, before training at the Royal Academy; there she took piano as her first study, gained an LRAM in performance, and was also awarded a teaching diploma in singing. She went on to have singing lessons with Roy Henderson, and after winning a Boise Foundation travelling scholarship she was able to study with Fernando Carpi and to travel to Milan and Rome. When she won first prize at the Concours International in Geneva in 1951 she was the first British singer to do so. In the same year she created the role of the Matron in Brian Easdale's opera <span class="italic">The Sleeping Children</span> at Cheltenham. Her first big success in the opera house was as Constanze in Mozart's <span class="italic">Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail</span> at Sadler's Wells in 1952, followed by the role of Donna Anna in <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> in the same season.<br>
<br>Jennifer Vyvyan had already made her operatic d&eacute;but in 1948, as Jenny Diver in Benjamin Britten's version of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, performed by the English Opera Group in Cambridge, and she was to appear in many more Britten operas. At Covent Garden on 8 June 1953 she sang the part of Lady Penelope Rich in the first performance of Britten's <span class="italic">Gloriana</span>, written to celebrate the coronation, and did so again in many future productions. Britten was so attracted by her voice and her dramatic gifts that he created three more parts for her: the governess in <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span>, first performed at La Fenice as part of the Venice Festival in 1954; Tytania in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> at Aldeburgh in 1960; and Mrs Julian in <span class="italic">Owen Wingrave</span>, commissioned for television and first broadcast in May 1971. She also appeared as Female Chorus in <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucretia</span>, and at various different times as Nancy, Miss Wordsworth, and Lady Billows in <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span>, in performances by the English Opera Group. She created roles in three operas by Malcolm Williamson: the countess de Serindan in <span class="italic">The Violins of Saint-Jacques</span> (1966) at Sadler's Wells, Agnes in <span class="italic">The Growing Castle</span> (1968) at Dinefwr Castle, and a series of comedy roles in <span class="italic">Lucky-Peter's Journey</span> (1969) at the Coliseum, London. She sang at Glyndebourne, where she took the role of Electra in <span class="italic">Idomeneo</span> in 1953, and made frequent appearances with the Handel Opera Society. She sang again at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1972 in Schumann's <span class="italic">Scenes from Goethe's Faust</span>, conducted by Britten.<br>
<br>But Jennifer Vyvyan did not confine herself to opera. She sang in choral works, including Britten's <span class="italic">Spring Symphony</span> and <span class="italic">War Requiem</span>, Beethoven's ninth symphony, and Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span> and <span class="roman">St John passion</span>. She took part in the first performance of <span class="italic">The Beatitudes</span>, the cantata written by Sir Arthur Bliss for the opening of the new Coventry Cathedral in 1962 but first performed in Coventry Theatre. She gave song recitals, and broadcast frequently.<br>
<br>Vyvyan was well known internationally. She went on a concert tour of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia in 1958, and made her first visit to the United States in 1963, when she sang in four performances of Britten's <span class="italic">Spring Symphony</span> with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. She was also one of the group of British musicians led by Sir Arthur Bliss on a British Council tour of the Soviet Union in April 1956. Her recordings included <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span> and Purcell's <span class="italic">The Fairy Queen</span>.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1962 Jennifer Vyvyan married Leon Crown (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), a chartered accountant, with whom she had one son. She died, suddenly, on 5 April 1974 at her home, 59 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, London.<br>
