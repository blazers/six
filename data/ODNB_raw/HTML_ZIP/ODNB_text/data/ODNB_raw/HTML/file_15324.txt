<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kemble <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hopkins; <em>other married name </em>Brereton]</span>,  Priscilla</span>  (1758&#150;1845), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in London on 17 December 1758, the younger daughter of two struggling actors, William Hopkins (<i>d</i>. 1780) and Elizabeth Barton (1731&#150;1801). It was not until after her birth that her father became established as prompter to, and her mother as an actress in, the Drury Lane company. It was at her parents' benefit on 19 April 1773 that she made her first appearance on the Drury Lane stage, delivering a specially composed &#145;Address to the town&#146; at the conclusion of <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. In his final season of 1775&#150;6, Garrick employed her fairly regularly in minor roles, most challengingly as Celia in William Whitehead's <span class="italic">The School for Lovers</span>, but also as the young Prince Edward for his own final appearances as Richard III. At the end of her second season, 1776&#150;7, she and her sister were awarded a joint benefit, where receipts amounted to a gratifying &pound;237 (less house charges of &pound;65). While she was not an outstanding beauty, Priscilla Hopkins was petite and lively enough to win a summer engagement at the increasingly fashionable theatre in Bath, principally as a soubrette. She was probably already infatuated with the talented but erratic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39763/', "William Brereton (1750/51&#150;1787)")</script>, some eight years her senior. In August 1777 what may have been an attempted elopement on her part, and a mere seduction on his, was foiled, and the couple were formally married in Bath on 24 September 1777. Just what should be read in her continuing to perform as Miss Hopkins during the 1777&#150;8 season at Drury Lane is uncertain. The marriage was probably doomed from the start, but the Breretons acted together at the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin during the summer of 1778, and it was as Mrs Brereton that Priscilla appeared during the next eight seasons at Drury Lane. Substantial roles included Mistress Ford in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> and the widowed Anne in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>. The couple's son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1832), was born in King's county, Ireland, and later joined the army, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>By 1784, with William Brereton drinking heavily, increasingly unstable, and probably desperately in love with an unmoved Sarah Siddons, the marriage was effectively over. He attempted suicide more than once, and was finally incarcerated in the Hoxton Lunatic Asylum when he threatened Priscilla's life. He died there on 17 February 1787. Presumably consolable, his young widow continued her engagement at Drury Lane, and on 8 December 1787 she made a second startling marriage. Her new husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15322/', "John Philip Kemble (1757&#150;1823)")</script>, was the leading tragedian of his generation, and could certainly have found a more impressive partner.<br>
<br>None of Kemble's biographers has had much to say about the marriage. James Boaden, who knew the couple best, credits the wife whom Kemble generally called Pop with &#145;quiet manners, steady principle, and gentle temper&#146;  (Boaden, 1.374), and the survival of the partnership, despite Kemble's frequently disorderly drinking, occasional philandering, and tumultuous theatrical career, must say something about her tolerance. What is surprising, given the Kembles' preparedness to promote each other's careers, is Priscilla's lack of advancement, even after her husband's promotion to manager of Drury Lane in September 1788. There is an odd perfunctoriness even about the wedding day: that same evening Priscilla appeared as Louisa Dudley in Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">The West Indian</span>. If she had talent as a performer, it would seem almost as if Kemble, either carelessly or intentionally, suppressed it. If she had not, he was never so starry-eyed as to deceive himself. By the season of 1795&#150;6 her salary at Drury Lane had risen to &pound;6 per week, but that was her last year as an actress. On 23 May 1796 she made her farewell appearance, as Flavia in her husband's adaptation of Dryden and Cibber's <span class="italic">The Comical Lovers</span>: the play was sufficiently altered to merit the new title of <span class="italic">Celedon and Florimel</span>. From then until Kemble's death in 1823, Priscilla seems to have been content to serve as a prop to his glittering social and theatrical career, accompanying him on most, but not all, of his travels until his retirement in 1817. There were social advantages, certainly. Neither as Miss Hopkins nor as Mrs Brereton would she have been invited to Wroxton Abbey as a guest of the earl of Guilford or to Haddo House, Lord Aberdeen's Scottish home. A sense of social achievement breathes through the letter she wrote to Elizabeth Inchbald after her &#145;every way triumphant&#146; management of the marquess of Abercorn's amateur theatricals at Bentley Priory in 1802  (Kelly, 143&#150;4), while Kemble was in Paris with his banker friend Robert Heathcote.<br>
<br>From 1818 to 1820, doctors having advised the asthmatic John Philip to escape the English damp, the Kembles lived in Toulouse, and from 1820 until his death in Lausanne. They had sold their house in Great Russell Street and could afford to live comfortably. After Kemble died his widow returned to England, assured of a &pound;1000 annuity and the income from any goods and properties she chose to sell. She lived initially at Heath Farm in Hertfordshire, where she was visited by her niece Fanny Kemble. Fanny enjoyed the riches of her aunt's library, reading Byron and Jeremy Taylor &#145;on the mossy-cushioned lawn under a beautiful oak tree, with a cabbage leaf of fresh-gathered strawberries and a handful of fresh-blown roses beside me&#146;  (Ransome, 19). At some time in the 1830s Priscilla moved to Leamington, where she devoted herself to good works and continued to read avidly. She died there on 13 May 1845, at the age of eighty-six, and was buried in the private chapel of the Greatheed family in St Mary's, Warwick. Her principal beneficiary was her brother-in-law Charles Kemble. In January 1832 her son by her first marriage, Thomas Brereton, committed suicide while standing trial by court martial for his conduct during the Bristol riots of October 1831.<br>
