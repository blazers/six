<span class="headword">Montagu,  John</span>, fifth earl of Sandwich  (1744&#150;1814), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 26 January 1744, the second but first surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19026/', "John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich (1718&#150;1792)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Dorothy (1716/17&#150;1797), daughter of Charles Fane, first Viscount Fane, and his wife, Mary Stanhope. Styled Viscount Hinchingbrooke from birth, at the age of four he was sent to board with his father's old master at Eton College, where he was a scholar from 1753 to 1758. In 1759 he entered the army and in 1761, through his father's influence, he was sent to Germany as aide-de-camp to General Earl Waldegrave and promoted lieutenant and captain in the Scots guards. He retired from the army in 1767.<br>
<br>Hinchingbrooke was a man of no real ability, but through the connections of his powerful father he became MP for Brackley in 1765. On 1 March 1766 he married Lady Elizabeth (Betty) Montagu (<i>d</i>. 1768), daughter of George Montagu, second earl of Halifax, and Anne Dunk; they had two children before her early death. In the year of her death, 1768, his father moved him to the Huntingdonshire constituency, which was dominated by the Montagu interest, and though his first election was hard fought there were no further contests until he succeeded his father to the earldom on 30 April 1792. On 25 April 1772 he married Lady Mary Powlett (1753&#150;1779), daughter of Harry Powlett, sixth duke of Bolton, and his first wife, Mary Munn; they had four children, only two of whom survived infancy.<br>
<br>Hinchingbrooke's public life was undistinguished. He seldom spoke in parliament, and in the Commons divisions he at first merely followed his father's line. He held the court appointment of vice-chamberlain of the household from 1771 to 1781 and was made master of the buckhounds by the Fox&#150;North coalition in May 1783. In November 1783 he announced his intention of withdrawing his support from the coalition on the grounds that &#145;he could not prevail upon himself to give additional strength to a combination of men whose purpose was to establish their own power in order to keep the King in perpetual subjection&#146;  (Martelli, 282&#150;3). His father soon made him see that he could not oppose a ministry that had appointed him to a lucrative court post but Hinchingbrooke certainly felt easier in his mind when Pitt became prime minister and continued him in his place. Thereafter he remained a Pittite and continued as master of the buckhounds until 1806. From 1807 until his death he enjoyed the post of joint postmaster-general.<br>
<br>Like his father Hinchingbrooke spent much of his life heavily in debt, and the family's financial problems were the cause of friction between father and son. After the old earl's death an astute agent and a long-anticipated windfall revived the family fortunes, and the fifth earl remained in possession of the Huntingdonshire estates and the family seat of Hinchingbrooke House, continuing to manage and control local parliamentary elections. He died in Upper Wimpole Street, London, on 6 June 1814, passing his earldom and estates to his only surviving son, George John Montagu (1773&#150;1818).<br>
