<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wright,  William Aldis</span>  (1831&#150;1914), <span class="occ">literary and biblical scholar</span>, was born at Beccles, Suffolk, on 1 August 1831, the second son of George Wright (1789&#150;1873), Baptist minister there, and his second wife, Elizabeth Higham, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13244/', "Thomas Higham (1795&#150;1844)")</script>, the engraver. After education at the Northgate House Academy and from 1847 at the Fauconberge Grammar School, Beccles, he was admitted in 1849 to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a sub-sizar, and was nineteenth wrangler in 1854. He taught in a school at Wimbledon in 1855, returned to Cambridge, and, on the removal of the religious tests, graduated BA in 1858 and MA in 1861.<br>
<br>Wright's first publication was an essay on Herrick in the <span class="italic">Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</span> for September 1856. He found regular employment on William Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> (1860&#150;63) and made his name as a scholar by his contributions to it, by his 1862 edition of Bacon's <span class="italic">Essays</span>, and by the part which he played with Henry Bradshaw in the exposure of the falsehoods of Constantine Simonides  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 3 Sept 1862, 26 Jan and 11 Nov 1863). In 1863 he was appointed librarian of Trinity College at Cambridge. His election to a fellowship, delayed by disagreements over his status as a nonconformist, occurred only in 1878. He was senior bursar from June 1870 (when he resigned the librarianship) to December 1895, and vice-master from February 1888 until his death. Although one of the great figures in the university, and frequently a valuable ally for the university library, he took no part latterly in university politics: he neither taught nor lectured. Few undergraduates ventured to speak to him, and even the younger fellows of his college were kept at a distance by the austere precision of his manner. His old-fashioned courtesy made him a genial host, but his circle of chosen friends was small.<br>
<br>Wright's edition (<span class="roman">Golden Treasury</span> series) of Bacon's <span class="italic">Essays</span> foreshadowed his later work in the accuracy of its text and the concise learning of its notes. He insisted on keeping the old spelling and punctuation, and was the first to point out emphatically that editors of early printed texts must expect variations in different copies of the same issue. He had used ten copies of the text which he reprinted, and found that some of the sheets were in three states, anticipating later editorial methods. He showed that the older punctuation was &#145;rhetorical and not grammatical&#146; in a memorandum (unpublished), &#145;On the use of the comma in the annexed book&#146; (that is, the copy of the prayer book annexed to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662), which he presented in 1894 to the Oxford and Cambridge university presses.<br>
<br>In 1863, after the publication of the first volume of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Shakespeare</span>, Wright succeeded John Glover as joint editor with William George Clark, and brought out the remaining eight volumes from 1863 to 1866. He was solely responsible for the second edition (1891&#150;3), which remains the great monument to his industry and accuracy. However, he was not responsible for its plan. In conversation he admitted the disadvantages of a modernized text and said that an editor who knows his business is better without a colleague. While the <span class="italic">Cambridge Shakespeare</span> was in progress he edited with Clark the <span class="italic">Globe Shakespeare</span> (1864; rev. 1904); and when it was complete they edited, between 1868 and 1872, <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, and <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> in the Clarendon Press series. Thereafter Wright carried on the series alone and added thirteen plays between 1874 (<span class="italic">The Tempest</span>) and 1897 (<span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>). Besides presenting a mass of new material he was the first editor to give due attention to the Elizabethan usage of words, and the value of this series has been acknowledged by many later editors. It was in his nature to be silent about poetic beauty and dramatic genius; but learning, accuracy, and common sense combined to make him one of Britain's greatest Shakespearian scholars.<br>
<br>In 1864 Wright undertook to collaborate with John Earle and Henry Bradshaw on an edition of Chaucer which ultimately became the <span class="italic">Oxford Chaucer</span>, edited by Walter William Skeat; but he retired in 1870, partly under the pressure of new duties. In 1867 he printed privately <span class="italic">The Clerk's Tale</span> from MS Dd. 4.24 in the Cambridge University Library. His other publications during the busy years of his librarianship were an abridgement of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, called the <span class="italic">Concise Dictionary</span> (1865); <span class="italic">The Bible Word-Book</span>, begun by Jonathan Eastwood (1866; 2nd edn 1884); the Clarendon Press edition (1869) of <span class="italic">Bacon's Advancement of Learning</span>; and the <span class="roman">Roxburghe Club</span> edition (1869) of Guillaume de Deguileville's <span class="italic">Pilgrimage of the Lyf of the Manhode</span>. In 1868 he edited with William George Clark and John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor the first number of the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span>, and he continued as its editor until 1913.<br>
<br>In 1870, when Wright became bursar of his college, he also became secretary to the Old Testament Revision Company. He missed only one of its 794 meetings from June 1870 to May 1885. His work on Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> had made him highly proficient in Hebrew, a study which he had begun as a schoolboy and which he continued under the guidance of S. M. Schiller-Szinessy; but he had the rarer qualification of knowing sixteenth-century English. None of the revisers could have had greater respect than he had for the English of Coverdale, and he is understood to have been largely responsible for the conservatism of the revision. (His official papers, showing every stage of the revision, are now in Cambridge University Library.) While engaged on the revision he also edited <span class="italic">Generydes</span> for the Early English Text Society (1873&#150;8) and contributed to Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</span> (1875&#150;80) and <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Biography</span> (1877&#150;87). In 1887 he completed for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> his edition of the <span class="italic">Metrical Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester</span>, which he had been forced to put aside in 1870.<br>
<br>From 1889 to 1903 Wright edited, as literary executor, the writings of his friend Edward FitzGerald, with whom he first became acquainted in 1868 as a result of shared interest in dialect. He worked on this project while maintaining, until 1895, his demanding position as bursar, yet he was able also to do an exacting revision of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Shakespeare</span> and edit separate plays, as well as a <span class="italic">Facsimile of the Milton MS. in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge</span> (1899). He brought out FitzGerald's <span class="italic">Letters and Literary Remains</span> in three volumes in 1889, and published the <span class="italic">Letters</span> by themselves, with additions (<span class="roman">Eversley</span> series) in 1894, the aim of the collection being &#145;to let FitzGerald tell the story of his own life&#146;. <span class="italic">Letters to Fanny Kemble</span> followed in 1895, <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (<span class="roman">Golden Treasury</span> series) in 1900, and <span class="italic">More Letters</span> in 1901. All were combined in the final edition of FitzGerald's <span class="italic">Letters and Literary Remains</span> (7 vols., 1902&#150;3). Wright took care never to come between the author and the reader, but his notes are informative none the less. In all respects he provided an example of how a contemporary ought to be edited.<br>
<br>Until his first serious illness, two years before his death, Wright had unwearying energy. His work after the age of seventy continued to show the same wide range; in quality it never varied. For Cambridge University Press (of which he was a syndic from 1872 to 1910) he edited <span class="italic">Milton's Poems with Critical Notes</span> (1903), the <span class="italic">English Works of Roger Ascham</span> (1904), and the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as printed in the original two issues (5 vols., 1909). In 1905 he brought out the third edition of Bishop Westcott's <span class="italic">History of the Bible</span> (undertaken at Westcott's request in 1901) and (with S. A. Hirsch) a <span class="italic">Commentary on the Book of Job from a Hebrew MS. in the Cambridge University Library</span>. Then he turned to Anglo-Norman and presented the Roxburghe Club with an edition (1909) of the long-lost Trinity College MS of <span class="italic">Femina</span>. For his last work he fittingly chose an edition of six English translations of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> from Tyndale to the Revised Version, and produced his <span class="italic">Hexaplar English Psalter</span> in 1911, at the age of eighty. In the same year he contributed to the second Lord Tennyson's <span class="italic">Tennyson and his Friends</span> an account of James Spedding. Since 1871 he had been engaged on an edition of Burton's <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span>, and had succeeded in tracing all but a few of the quotations. Before his death he distributed many of his books among the Cambridge libraries. By his will he left &pound;5000 to the University Library and &pound;5000 to the library of his college, as well as a valuable collection of early printed books and over 150 Hebrew manuscripts.<br>
<br>The amount of Wright's work is the more remarkable considering that he suffered from writer's cramp and had to learn to use his left hand. However, he allowed nothing to interfere with his methodical habits, and he faced all his tasks with an iron will. As an editor he felt it his duty to present his material in such a way that it would speak for itself. He distrusted theories and intuitions, and all the short cuts which cleverness is tempted to adopt. &#145;Ignorance and conceit&#146;, he said, &#145;are the fruitful parents of conjectural emendation&#146;, and he would quote the rabbinical saying, &#145;Teach thy lips to say &#147;I do not know&#148;&#146;. He never forgot that he was the servant rather than the master of his material, and consistently, throughout a career of over fifty years, was the most impersonal of the great editors. A superficial reader may find his work dry, and may even think of him as a mere scholiast, but all those who are editors have continually found that Wright has taken account of facts which others have failed to see. He received the honorary degrees of LLD at Edinburgh (1879), DCL at Oxford (1886), and LittD at Dublin (1895). His one mistake was over the Squire Papers, forgeries of correspondence by Oliver Cromwell (<span class="italic">The Academy</span>, 11 April and 2 May 1885; <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, April 1886); FitzGerald had believed in their authenticity, and for once Wright's judgement was misled by friendship. Generous in lending his books, in conversation, as in his writings, he might seem to be incapable of any display of sentiment, but the friends who were permitted to get behind his somewhat rigid sincerity found a warm heart and great depth of feeling. He died, unmarried, on 19 May 1914 in the Cambridge rooms he had occupied since 1865, and was buried in St Giles's cemetery in Cambridge.<br>
