<span class="headword">Pack,  Richardson</span>  (1682&#150;1728), <span class="occ">army officer and writer</span>, born on 29 November 1682, was the son of John Pack (1652&#150;1723) of London, gentleman, who settled at Wickham Skeith and then Stoke Ash in Suffolk, serving as high sheriff there in 1697, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1713), the daughter and coheir of Robert Richardson of Tudhoe, co. Durham. From Merchant Taylors' School, which he entered in 1693, Pack matriculated as a fellow-commoner at St John's College, Oxford, in June 1697, but left in 1698 to study law at the Middle Temple. After eight terms he was called to the bar but, preferring the active life, joined the army, and by March 1705 had obtained command of a company of foot under Colonel Nicholas Lepel. He was still a bachelor when on 5 October 1707 he and Audrey Gibson (later Mrs White) baptized their daughter, Rebecca, at St Giles Cripplegate; the child was given Pack's name and he remembered her in his will of 1729, recalling that &#145;on other occasions&#146; he had &#145;encouraged her good behaviour&#146;.<br>
<br>Pack next served in the War of the Spanish Succession; he wrote from Mombris in Catalonia in October 1709 to John Creed at Oundle. His regiment served with Marshal Stahrenberg at the battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710. The day after General Stanhope and his troops were taken at Brihuega, Pack's major was killed, and his bravery, as senior captain, won him immediate promotion and the lifelong friendship of his general, John Campbell, duke of Argyll. More of Pack's movements and friends are revealed by addresses on his published pieces, the first collection of which he dedicated to Colonel William Stanhope, ambassador in Madrid. The notorious Edmund Curll was his faithful London publisher, but others produced Dublin editions. In 1713 he was writing to his friend Captain David Campbell from Minorca, presumably while on the staff of Argyll, governor there at the time.<br>
<br>Back in Ipswich in June 1714, Pack complained of the hardships of a half-pay officer; later that summer he was at Stoke Ash with his widowed father. At the time of the Jacobite rebellion he was recalled as major in Colonel Lucas's regiment of foot, in which he served for three years. About then Captain Campbell died, and Pack married Mary, a Campbell heiress (perhaps the daughter David and Mary Campbell, baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 30 November 1688); whether she was related to the captain cannot now be established. Some time in 1719 Mary gave birth to a son, John, at their house in Jermyn Street, St James's, but the next year they were living at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, where Pack had acquired the ruins of the great abbey. Probably for the materials, he dismantled the 400 foot east range of the Great Court, the former abbot's palace, and obliterated all traces of the abbey's formal gardens. Pack's poems, headed &#145;Bury Toasts&#146;, show how much he enjoyed the society of young ladies of good family there; he wrote and dedicated verses to, <i>inter alia</i>, a Bunbury, a Paston, a Hervey, a D'Ewes, even the countess of Rochford.<br>
<br>It was during the last nine years of his life that Pack's work began to be published. He admired the Roman elegiac poets, translating their poems, and three of their lives from the Latin of Cornelius Nepos: T. P. Atticus, Miltiades, and Cimon; he was too indolent to do more as he intended. The three lives appeared in his <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</span> (1719); for the second set the same year he added two &#145;essays on study and conversation&#146; in letters to David Campbell. Both were printed at Dublin in 1726, and the year after his death his complete works appeared in one volume. Pack wrote a prologue to George Sewell's <span class="italic">Tragedy of Sir Walter Raleigh</span> and an epilogue to Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Spartan Dame</span>; Sewell responded with lines written on reading Pack's poems. He exchanged poems with Matthew Prior, and asked Prior to sit for his picture for him, and to ask Pope and Congreve to do the same.<br>
<br>In 1722 Pack bought Northgate House in the street of that name in Bury St Edmunds; and when in spring 1724 he became dangerously ill, it was the celebrated Richard Mead who saved his life. Early in 1725 he was again in service at Exeter as a major in Colonel Montagu's regiment of the Devonshires, the 11th foot. In October 1727 he wrote an ode in praise of George II, addressed to the new monarch through the earl of Scarbrough. Expecting an invitation to court to be thanked, he was instead ordered to march with his regiment from Exeter to Aberdeen. In December 1728 Scotland, that &#145;country, which was his aversion when living, proved to be the scene of his death&#146;  (Pack, &#145;Memoir&#146;). His wish to be buried at Stoke Ash was not carried out, and he was buried on 3 January 1729 in St Nicholas churchyard, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Pack's will was locked in a desk at Northgate House, as one of his executors, Sir Edmund Bacon, bt, of Garboldisham, deposed: &#145;about the middle of December &hellip; a messenger came express from one Mr ACourt in Scotland&#146; bearing a letter with the key. Pack's widow, Mary, was left an annuity of &pound;50 without further comment; that and the episode of the key imply that they were estranged. Rebecca Pack and Edmund Bacon both received &pound;50 legacies, but the other executor, George Read, esquire, of Golden Square, was left a &#145;gold watch that was the glorious King William's&#146;. Pack's estates near Birmingham and at Hepworth in Suffolk, as well as property in Bury St Edmunds, were to provide for his &#145;dear and entirely beloved and only son John&#146;, not yet ten years old. John went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where in 1744 he became LLB and a fellow, and was ordained. From 1752 to his death eleven years later he was rector of Little Whelnetham, where he was buried.<br>
