<span class="headword">Bischoff,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1775, <em>d.</em> 1845), <span class="occ">merchant and writer</span>, was baptized on 15 November 1775 at Call Lane Arian Independent chapel, Leeds, the younger son of the six children of George Bischoff (1737&#150;1812), a merchant, and his second wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of John Crompton of Gainsborough and the widow of William Whitaker of Leeds. James Bischoff's grandfather, of German extraction but born in Basel, had settled in Leeds around 1715. The family prospered in the chief centre of the West Riding wool textile industry, and in 1782 they were reckoned to be the second largest cloth export house in Leeds.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Bischoff's education and training, but he was, like so many of his forebears and members of his wife's family, occupied as a cloth merchant in Leeds at the turn of the eighteenth century. In 1802 he married Margaret, the daughter of David Stansfeld, a prosperous Leeds cloth merchant. Her maternal grandfather, Thomas Wolrich, another leading merchant in the town, had collected a notable series of statistics relating to the cloth industry in the early 1770s. Bischoff had ample access to these papers; perhaps they inspired him to begin his own tireless researches into, and defence of, the industry. He first came to public notice in 1816 with a series of letters in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, the <span class="italic">Farmer's Journal</span>, and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> opposing the imposition of a duty of 6<i>d</i>. per pound on imported wool, nevertheless levied between 1820 and 1824 as a measure to relieve the distressed British agricultural sector. An advocate of free trade, he was appointed one of the deputies from the West Riding to a series of meetings in London to promote the repeal of the wool duty. He was prominent in collecting statistics to support their case, and published two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Reasons for the Immediate Repeal of the Tax on Foreign Wool</span> (1819) and <span class="italic">Observations</span> (1820) on the <span class="italic">Report of the Earl of Sheffield to the Meeting at Lewes Wool Fair, July 20, 1820</span>. In 1824 the duty was reduced to a nominal 1<i>d</i>. in the pound, and, in a move to placate the agricultural interest, exports of wool (there were very few as imports burgeoned) were allowed for the first time for centuries on the payment of the same negligible rate. In the following year Bischoff was consulted by William Huskisson, president of the Board of Trade, about a reduction of duties on foreign manufactured goods. Bischoff advocated free trade, views he again propounded in his evidence to the House of Lords committee on the British wool trade in 1828.<br>
<br>By the early 1820s Bischoff was living in London, working as a merchant and insurance broker. After 1824 he was prominent in the affairs of the Van Diemen's Land Company. With a nominal capital of &pound;1 million (10,000 shares of &pound;100 each), and supported by several members of parliament, it was one of the many speculative companies launched in the boom of 1823&#150;5. Bischoff was its managing director. By 1831 it had acquired 350,000 acres of good sheep land in north-west Tasmania, where Mount Bischoff is named after him. Although it seems that he had never been there, he wrote <span class="italic">A Sketch of the History of Van Diemen's Land</span> (1832). Four years later, he published an essay on marine insurance.<br>
<br>Bischoff's most important work, however, was his compilation <span class="italic">A comprehensive history of the woollen and worsted manufactures, and the natural and commercial history of sheep, from the earliest records to the present period</span> (1842). It brought together, in two volumes, a multitude of material about the wool textile industry, especially those statistics and papers relating to his own activities surrounding the duty in wool. Together with John James's <span class="italic">History of the Worsted Manufacture in England from the Earliest Times</span> (1857), it provides a mine of information about the evolution of Britain's premier industry and its principal raw material, wool. Bischoff's last publication was a pamphlet inveighing against foreign tariffs, originally printed as a series of articles appearing in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> between October and February 1843. He died on 8 February 1845 at his home, 20 Highbury Terrace, Highbury, Middlesex, leaving a family of three sons (the youngest of them was in partnership with his father) and four daughters.<br>
