<span class="headword">Davis,  John Bunnell</span>  (1777&#150;1824), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was one of the eleven or more children of Timothy Davis, a surgeon-apothecary at Thetford in Norfolk, who later moved to London, becoming surgeon-general to the customs. Davis was born in June 1777 at Clare, Suffolk, and was baptized on 17 July 1777 there. He studied surgery at Guy's Hospital and St Thomas's Hospital, London, and became a member of the Company of Surgeons.<br>
<br>Because of severe illness, after receiving his diploma Davis served as medical attendant to a family travelling in France during the peace of Amiens, but had the misfortune to be detained in France as a prisoner of war. He made the best of his circumstances, continuing his medical studies at Montpellier, and graduating MD there in 1803, having completed a dissertation on cancer. Confined later at Verdun, he published <span class="italic">Observations on Precipitate Burial and the Diagnosis of Death</span> (1806). He sent a copy of the work to J. N. Corvisart, Napolean's first physician, along with a petition for his release. Permission for Davis's release was granted soon after, and he returned to England in May 1806. Influenced by his detention in France, in 1807 Davis published <span class="italic">More Subjects Than One</span>, a two-volume collection of essays and reflections on France, and an account of the climate of Nice and its suitability for invalids.<br>
<br>Davis proceeded to Edinburgh University and graduated MD on 24 June 1808, reading a dissertation on phthisis. In September 1809 he was appointed hospital mate for general service in the army and was sent to a hospital at Ipswich to attend to the troops invalided home from Walcheren. As a result, he published an account entitled <span class="italic">A scientific and popular view of the fever at Walcheren and its consequences, as they appeared in the British troops returned from the late expedition: with an account of the morbid anatomy of the body and the efficacy of drastic purges and mercury in the treatment of this disease</span> (1810). The book contained an account of the symptoms of the fever, and a collection of post-mortem records. They show that what was called Walcheren fever included several kinds of dysentery, enteric fever, and enteric fever complicated with malarial fever.<br>
<br>Davis resigned in 1812 and settled in practice in London, having become a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1810. He was physician to the Northern Dispensary and Surrey Dispensary, and in 1816 was the joint founder of, and physician to, the Universal Dispensary for Sick Indigent Children at St Andrew's Hill, Doctors' Commons. This was the first large-scale institution devoted to the care of sick children, and it accepted children from any locality.<br>
<br>In 1817 Davis published <span class="italic">A Cursory Inquiry into some of the Principal Causes of Mortality among Children</span>, based on and containing an account of his experiences at the dispensary. The publication of <span class="italic">Annals, Historical and Medical, of the Universal Dispensary for Children</span> followed in 1821, the year in which the dispensary was renamed the Royal Universal Dispensary for Children.<br>
<br>Davis died suddenly on 28 September 1824 at the age of forty-seven, leaving a widow and three children. He was buried at Kensington.<br>
