<span class="headword">Miall,  (Rowland) Leonard</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">broadcaster and television executive</span>, was born on 6 November 1914 at 73 Corringham Road, Golders Green, London, the elder son of Rowland Miall (1879&#150;1955), scientific instrument maker, and his wife, Sara Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dixon (1885&#150;1975). He was a scholar at Bootham School, York, and went on first to Freiburg University, where he studied German, and then to St John's College, Cambridge, where he read economics and law. In 1936 he was president of the Union and editor of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span>. In a profile of Miall, <span class="italic">Granta</span> predicted that he would end up in the BBC.<br>
<br>After lecturing in the United States and serving for two years as secretary of British-American Associates, in 1939 Miall joined the BBC's newly formed German Service as its first talks producer. His colleagues then included Hugh Greene, the future director-general of the BBC, Patrick Gordon Walker, the future foreign secretary, and Marius Goring, the actor. There were tensions over what should be broadcast to Germany in wartime: the BBC sought editorial independence, while the government's black propaganda units sought control. Miall honed his diplomatic skills during those years. In 1942 he was seconded to the political warfare executive and sent to the United States, first as director of news in San Francisco and then as head of the office in New York. His affection for America never ceased. After returning to Europe in 1944, he worked as personal assistant to the deputy director-general of the political warfare executive and then, briefly, in the psychological warfare division of the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force in Luxembourg. On 18 January 1941 he had married Lorna Barbara Rackham (1916&#150;1974), the 24-year-old daughter of George John Rackham, mechanical engineer. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Miall rejoined the BBC in 1945 and, after a brief spell as special correspondent in Czechoslovakia, became the corporation's Washington correspondent. He was a skilled broadcaster, reporting on American affairs with authority. He knew the powerful people in Washington, and he was on good terms with opinion formers like Edward R. Murrow and James Reston. He had a gift for spotting the importance of a story. Never was this more true than in 1947, when he heard of General George Marshall's speech at Harvard on reconstruction in war-ravaged Europe. Americans were sympathetic to Europe's plight, Marshall said, and he urged the European nations to set up a concerted plan. Because Ernest Bevin, the British foreign secretary, heard Miall's broadcast, diplomatic action followed swiftly and the Marshall plan was born. Years later Dean Acheson, by then the secretary of state, said: &#145;It was a good thing that Leonard did not lose his voice that night&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>In 1954 Miall returned to London and was appointed head of the quaintly named television talks, a department which under his leadership went on to be responsible for such programmes as <span class="italic">Panorama</span>, <span class="italic">Tonight</span>, <span class="italic">Monitor</span>, <span class="italic">Zoo Quest</span>, <span class="italic">Gallery</span>, <span class="italic">The Sky at Night</span>, <span class="italic">Face to Face</span>, and many other documentaries and programmes ranging from science to gardening. It was a heady time for television and for those who worked in the shabby offices in Lime Grove studios, London. Miall was in charge of a group of talented people who went on to command the heights in broadcasting, Huw Wheldon, David Attenborough, Donald Baverstock, and Alasdair Milne among them. On screen the reporters&#151;who included Richard Dimbleby, James Mossman, Robert Kee, and Alan Whicker&#151;showed craftsmanship of the highest order. Miall encouraged them with a friendly nod usually; a gentle admonition occasionally. Egos were pushed to one side, pressure from Broadcasting House as well as the political parties was fielded deftly. But it was too good to last.<br>
<br>One Friday morning in 1962 (the year after he was appointed assistant controller, current affairs and talks, and appointed OBE) Miall was summoned by the director-general, Hugh Greene, his wartime colleague, and told that he would be replaced by his deputy, Grace Wyndham Goldie, fourteen years his senior. Greene offered him a post in Scotland, but such was the affection in which Miall was held in the television service that a job was created for him within forty-eight hours. By the Monday morning Miall had an office in Television Centre as special assistant to the director of television (Kenneth Adam), with the task of planning the start of BBC2, then three years away. So well did he buckle down to this administrative job that within a year he was promoted to assistant controller, programme services.<br>
<br>In 1966 the BBC showed its wisdom by sending Miall back to New York as its American representative. For the next four years he was a fine ambassador for the BBC and for Britain. He had always cared for the United States, he had many friends in the television networks there and in Washington, and he entertained stylishly, but modestly. Back in London, Miall spent the last three years of his BBC career as controller of overseas and foreign relations, a roving job that took him around the world, advising foreign broadcasters on what the BBC was all about. Because he was such a likeable person with a natural charm, he opened many doors and made new friends.<br>
<br>With the exception of war service Leonard Miall's entire working life was spent in the BBC and even after his formal retirement in 1974 he continued to work for the corporation part-time as its research historian. He prepared the material for three of Asa Briggs's books about the BBC, and in 1994 he published <span class="italic">Inside the BBC</span>, a book of profiles of twenty-five personalities from Lord Reith to Sir Robin Day. These were short but witty essays, reflecting the urbanity of the author. He continued to write, because it was his hobby, and his name was often seen under some of the obituaries in <span class="italic">The Independent</span>.<br>
<br>Of middling height, slightly stooped, Miall had a visual resemblance to Alastair Sim, and his stories were illuminated by his genuine enjoyment in telling them. His first wife, Lorna, having died in 1974, on 10 October 1975 he married <a href="#cosubject_105614">Sarah Greenaway (Sally) Bicknell [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He died at his home, Maryfield Cottage, High Street, Taplow, Buckinghamshire, on 24 February 2005, of bronchopneumonia and cerebral vascular disease.<br>
<br>Miall's second wife, <a name="cosubject_105614"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Greenaway <span class="st"> [Sally]</span> Miall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Leith]</span></span>  (1918&#150;2010), <span class="occ">rally driver and novelist</span>, was born on 18 December 1918 at New Hall, Romford, Essex, the daughter of (George Easlemont) Gordon Leith (1885&#150;1965), a South African architect who had served as a captain in the Royal Field Artillery (but was recovering from a gas attack on the Western Front), and his wife, Ethel Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox (1888&#150;1974). After the war her father worked with the War Graves Commission in France before returning to South Africa with his young family; Sally spent the majority of her childhood in Johannesburg. In 1934 she returned to England with her mother and two sisters, and was enrolled at Roedean School in Brighton, from where she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read English and made lifelong friends. On 26 July 1940 she married a fellow student, Nigel Bicknell (1918&#150;1990), who by then was a pilot in the Volunteer Reserve. He subsequently flew reconnaissance missions over occupied Europe (Sally meanwhile working during the war at Bletchley Park) then, via a posting as air attach&eacute; in Washington soon after the war, joined the Foreign Service, serving in Istanbul and Athens.<br>
<br>While bringing up their four sons, Sally Bicknell indulged her love of fast driving, winning the Ladies cup in the Acropolis rally in 1956, in a Fiat 600. She also began writing the first of a series of novels (mostly published under the name Sally Bicknell) which included <span class="italic">The Midwinter Violins</span> (1973), <span class="italic">The Summer of the Warehouse</span> (1979), and <span class="italic">Follow that Uncle!</span> (1980). She and Nigel Bicknell were divorced in 1975, and later the same year she married Leonard Miall. For many years she served as secretary to the London committee of the British School at Athens, based in Gordon Square, London, but with yearly trips to Athens. After her husband's death she continued to live at Maryfield Cottage in Taplow until shortly before her death on 6 October 2010 at Austenwood Nursing Home in Gerrards Cross, of cancer of the colon. She was survived by three of her four sons and by her four step-children.<br>
