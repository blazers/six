<span class="headword">Bulstrode,  Cecily</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1584, <em>d.</em> 1609), <span class="occ">courtier and subject of poetry</span>, was baptized on 12 February 1584 at Beaconsfield, one of the ten children of Edward Bulstrode (<i>d</i>. 1595), landowner, and his wife, Cecily (<i>fl</i>. 1575&#150;1608), daughter of Sir John Croke of Chilton, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, and sister of Sir John Croke, recorder of London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3929/', "Edward Bulstrode (c.1588&#150;1659)")</script> was her brother.<br>
<br>Members of the Bulstrode family had been minor courtiers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and Cecily Bulstrode followed them. In 1605 she was among the entourage of the countess of Bedford, her mother's first cousin and her father's second cousin. Her possession at that time of a copy of a surreptitiously circulated puritan text suggests that she shared Lady Bedford's godly religious inclinations. By 1607 she and her sister Dorothy were gentlewomen of the queen's bedchamber. She became the object of scandalous gossip at court. Two poems attributed to Sir John Roe, &#145;True Love Finds Wit&#146; and &#145;Shall I go force an elegie?&#146; are identified as about her in early manuscripts; the latter is about a woman's offer to have sexual intercourse once, and once only, with an admirer. Bulstrode has, on the basis of an obscure passage in a letter of Donne's, been seen as the lover of Roe's brother Sir Thomas. Ben Jonson attacked her as promiscuous, vain, and untrustworthy in his &#145;Epigram on the Court Pucell&#146;, a copy of which was stolen from him when he was drunk and given to Bulstrode. The subject of this poem associates with &#145;sermoneeres&#146;, but also with wits at court, and writes &#145;newes Equall with that, which for the best newes goes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, 8.222). This has been taken as evidence that the essays called &#145;newes&#146; which were published with Sir Thomas Overbury's poem <span class="italic">A Wife</span> were composed by friends of Bulstrode's, and that she herself wrote the essay &#145;Newes of my Morning Worke&#146;, which is identified in <span class="italic">A Wife</span> as by &#145;Mris B&#146;. Jonson's poem is, however, to some extent a formal exercise in satire, and it would be unwise to depend upon it as a biographical document.<br>
<br>Bulstrode fell ill in 1609, suffering great pain, sleeplessness, fever, and vomiting. Francis Anthony dosed her with potable gold, and claimed that this had helped her. She died on 4 August 1609 at the countess of Bedford's house, The Park, Twickenham, and was buried two days later at the church there. The title of a poem on her death by Edward Herbert (later Lord Herbert of Cherbury) states that she died &#145;non sine inquietudine spiritus et conscientiae&#146; (&#145;with an unquiet spirit and conscience&#146;). Jonson also commemorated her in verse, as did Donne, in the poems &#145;Death I recant&#146; and &#145;Language thou art too narrow&#146;, which can be seen as products of Lady Bedford's patronage. Another elegy, &#145;Death be not proud&#146;, apparently a reply to &#145;Death I recant&#146;, has been ascribed to the countess herself.<br>
<br>In the 1990s Bulstrode was rediscovered by historians of women's writing. Although &#145;Newes of my Morning Worke&#146; is very short, and dubiously ascribed to her, it has been admired by some critics, and it has been suggested that more witty pieces by her may lie undiscovered.<br>
