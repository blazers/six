<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ashmore, Sir  Peter William Beckwith</span>  (1921&#150;2002), <span class="occ">naval officer and courtier</span>, was born on 4 February 1921 at 5 Coombe Villas, Saltash, Cornwall, the younger son (there were no daughters) of Lieutenant (later Vice-Admiral) Leslie Haliburton Ashmore (1893&#150;1974), naval officer, and his wife, Tamara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tamara Vasilyevna Schutt (<i>d</i>. 1972). His mother was Russian, and his parents had married at Balaklava during the intervention in 1919. Peter and his elder brother Edward (<i>b</i>. 1919) accompanied their parents as their father's naval service took him to Germany, Malta, and South Africa, where he commanded a sloop operating from Simonstown. After a difficult time at Western Province preparatory school the Ashmore brothers returned to Britain to Yardley Court School, at Tonbridge, Kent. At their own request Peter and Edward (who rose to be first sea lord and chief of defence staff) entered the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. Peter joined in 1934 and came out top of his year, winning the king's gold medal. He was appointed midshipman in 1938 to the cruiser <i>Dorsetshire</i> on the China station, where his father commanded her sister ship HMS <i>Kent</i>. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the <i>Dorsetshire</i> was sent to the Indian Ocean to hunt German pocket battleships.<br>
<br>Returning to the UK for sub-lieutenant's courses, in which he again came out top, Ashmore was in January 1941 appointed to the destroyer <i>Kipling</i>, one of six ships in Lord Mountbatten's 5th flotilla. Sent to the Mediterranean, the flotilla was involved in the operations around Crete following the German invasion in May 1941. <i>Kelly</i>, the flotilla leader, and <i>Kashmir</i> were bombed and sunk but <i>Kipling</i> rescued 279 men, including Mountbatten. After the death of <i>Kipling</i>'s first lieutenant, Ashmore took over the tactical direction of the destroyer and played a key role in driving off further attacks, for which he was awarded the DSC. He was also mentioned in dispatches after his ship sank a U-boat off Tobruk. In March 1942 <i>Kipling</i> was involved in the second battle of Sirte, helping hold off a much more powerful Italian surface fleet from a Malta-bound convoy. Two months later her luck ran out when she was sunk by German bombers; Ashmore was among the survivors rescued by the destroyer <i>Jervis</i>. He was next sent to the escort destroyer <i>Melbreak</i>, operating in the channel, and then to the new cruiser <i>Royalist</i>, which was involved in carrier strikes in Norwegian waters, including attacks on the battleship <i>Tirpitz</i>. <i>Royalist</i> then moved to the Mediterranean for the invasion of southern France and operations in the Aegean. Towards the end of the war Ashmore was appointed executive officer of the destroyer <i>Tartar</i>, which was deployed to the Indian Ocean, where he saw action against the Japanese and was again mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Ashmore had great personal charm and in January 1946 became, with Wing Commander Peter Townsend, an equerry to George VI. He accompanied the royal family on their tour of South Africa and was noted for his quiet efficiency. He was appointed MVO and an extra equerry to the king when he left the palace to resume sea service in 1948. He commanded the frigate <i>Loch Fada</i> before joining the staff at Dartmouth, his period of service there being shortened by early promotion to the rank of commander in 1951. On 18 October the following year he married Patricia Moray Buller, daughter of Admiral Sir Henry Buller and his wife, Lady Hermione Stuart; the queen, Princess Margaret, and Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, acted as witnesses. There were three daughters and one son of the marriage.<br>
<br>Following appointments in the Admiralty and command of the cadet training carrier <i>Triumph</i>, Ashmore was in 1957 promoted captain and appointed deputy director of the Staff College at Greenwich. From 1960 to 1961 he commanded the Dartmouth training squadron as captain (F) in the frigate <i>Urchin</i>. Attendance at the Imperial Defence College was a prelude to being appointed director of naval plans in 1963. This was a difficult period for the navy, with the creation of a unified Ministry of Defence in 1964 being closely followed by a major defence review. Ashmore did his best to save the carrier programme but failed. Promoted rear-admiral in 1966, he became flag officer, Admiralty interview board, and then in 1967 chief of staff to the commander-in-chief, western fleet. Appointed CB in 1968, he was promoted vice-admiral in 1969. The following year he was appointed chief of staff at NATO headquarters, southern Europe. Again times were difficult, with Dom Mintoff ejecting the allies from Malta, but Ashmore was able to ensure that the transfer of NATO headquarters to Naples went smoothly. He was knighted KCB in 1972.<br>
<br>Offered promotion to admiral and appointment as British military representative with NATO in Brussels, Ashmore decided instead to accept the post of master of her majesty's household. He took up his appointment in 1973 and retired in 1986. During this time he was responsible for all the royal palaces and accompanied the queen on royal tours. He received unwelcome publicity in 1982 when an intruder, Michael Fagan, gained access to the queen's quarters through a window in Ashmore's office. Nevertheless his term of office was widely regarded as highly successful. He was appointed KCVO in 1980. After retirement to Sundridge, near Sevenoaks, Kent, he busied himself with church work, fund-raising for an old people's home, and presiding over the local branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He died of a stroke on 31 July 2002 at the Kent and Sussex Hospital, Tunbridge Wells, and was survived by his wife and their four children.<br>
