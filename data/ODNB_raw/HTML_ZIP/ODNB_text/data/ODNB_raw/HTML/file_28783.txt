<span class="headword">Warren,  Lemuel</span>  (1770&#150;1833), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, entered the army as an ensign in the 17th foot on 7 March 1787, obtained his lieutenancy in it on 27 October 1788, and was for some time on Lord Hood's fleet, in which the regiment served as marines. On 12 June 1793 he raised an independent company of foot, of which he was appointed captain; but on 2 January 1794 exchanged to the 27th (Inniskillings), then in Lord Moira's army camped at Southampton. He served with the 27th in Flanders from 1794 to 1796 under the duke of York; he was present at the siege of Nijmegen and at the sortie of 6 November, and commanded the advanced picquet of the garrison. He accompanied the force under Lord Cathcart sent to attack the French army at Bommel, and was present at the action of Geldermalsen in January 1796.<br>
<br>Warren embarked with the 27th for the West Indies in September 1796, and commanded their grenadiers at the storming of the advanced posts at Morne Fortun&eacute;, St Lucia; at the conclusion of the operations he was compelled by sickness to return to England. He served in the expedition to the Netherlands in 1799, including the actions of 27 August, 19 September, and 2 and 6 October. He served as a major of the 27th (from 31 December 1799) in the expedition to Ferrol in 1800; and in the Egyptian campaign of 1801, including the operations before Alexandria, receiving the Sultan's medal for the campaign. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the 27th on 16 August 1804. He served in the expedition to Sicily in 1809, and afterwards on the east coast of Spain. He commanded a brigade at the battle of Castalla, and the siege of Tarragona, and was present at the blockade of Barcelona.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1813 Warren was promoted colonel in the army. He accompanied the division of the British army across the Peninsula to Bayonne, and from there to Bordeaux, where the 27th immediately embarked for North America. He joined the 1st battalion of the Inniskillings before Paris in 1815, a few days before the entry of Louis XVIII. He was promoted major-general on 12 August 1819, and died suddenly in London on 29 October 1833.<br>
