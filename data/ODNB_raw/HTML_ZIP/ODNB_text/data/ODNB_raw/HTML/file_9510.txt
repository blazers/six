<span class="headword">Fisher,  Thomas</span>  (1772&#150;1836), <span class="occ">artist and antiquary</span>, was born on 24 February 1772 in Rochester, Kent, and baptized there on 20 March at the church of St Nicholas. He was the second son of the two sons and one younger daughter of Thomas Fisher (<i>d</i>. 1786), printer, bookseller, and alderman of Rochester, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1796). His father was the author of <span class="italic">The Kentish Traveller's Companion</span> (1776) and, with Samuel Denne (1730&#150;1799) and William Shrubsole, of <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Rochester</span> (1772).<br>
<br>At the age of fourteen Fisher was given employment by the East India Company at East India House, Leadenhall Street, in the City of London. In 1789 he was appointed as an extra clerk, and in 1816 he was placed on the establishment in the newly created post of searcher of the records in the examiner's department. The position provided him with a reasonable income, raised in 1825 to &pound;700 a year, and when the post was abolished in 1834, he retired with a pension of &pound;473 a year.<br>
<br>Fisher is best-known for his scale drawings, which record interior church monuments with considerable accuracy and care over details. He used his summer leave to tour the country, taking rubbings of brasses and making sketches; during the rest of the year, in the early morning, he worked up the finished watercolours and made copies. In 1814 he estimated that he had taken about 5000 drawings in the course of twenty years' travelling and recording unpublished architectural and genealogical antiquities. His earliest drawings were of Kent monuments; some of Rochester Cathedral, made when fifteen, illustrated Samuel Denne's memorials published in John Thorpe's <span class="italic">Custumale Roffense</span> (1788). He also provided Samuel Denne with drawings of watermarks found on documents in Rochester town hall, and published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (1796). Richard Gough (1735&#150;1809) used Fisher's work in the second volume of <span class="italic">Sepulchral Monuments</span> (1796), and commissioned him to record monuments such as those in Moreton Corbet, Shropshire, in 1807. The most notable of his Kent drawings were of the fine series of brasses in Cobham church. Three of his drawings were exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1804 and 1808. While touring Warwickshire in 1804, Fisher recorded the medieval paintings just discovered in the chapel of the Guild of Holy Cross in Stratford and which were soon afterwards whitewashed over or destroyed.<br>
<br>Fisher was interested in ways of reproducing his drawings and was one of the first to advocate the use of lithography, or &#145;polyautography&#146; as it was then called in Britain; he wrote articles for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1808 and 1815 on its advantages and development. He was possibly the first to reproduce a non-latin script by this means, when he published in June 1807 a drawing of the Babylonian characters found on the Hillah stone in the East India Company's museum. He issued several other lithographs of brasses and monuments at this time, but the most important series was of the Stratford paintings, which he published under the title of <span class="italic">A series of antient &hellip; paintings &hellip; on the walls of the chapel of the Trinity at Stratford-upon-Avon</span> (parts 1 and 2 lithoprinted in 1807; additional plates engraved in 1809). Fisher assembled an important collection of early examples of lithography and continued to experiment with the process, occasionally supplying prints to illustrate books and publishing his own.<br>
<br>Fisher was the first to attempt a systematic visual record of the historical monuments of Bedfordshire, noting that few illustrations of the county had been previously published. He was helped by his colleague at the East India Company Henry Humphrey Goodhall, the antiquary, often stayed with the Revd Orlebar Marsh in Felmersham, and received commissions from the eccentric collector Sir Gregory Osborne Page Turner of Battlesden. He made several tours between about 1811 and 1823, suffering the hazards of working in cold and wet weather, sleeping in unaired beds, and being robbed of his possessions. By 1812 he had made about 200 drawings of the county's antiquities and began publishing a selection of engravings under the title of <span class="italic">Collections, Historical, Genealogical and Topographical for Bedfordshire</span> to illustrate the Bedfordshire volume of Daniel and Samuel Lysons's <span class="italic">Magna Britannica</span> (1806). Five parts were issued by 1816 before the series was abandoned; he published a volume of lithographs, <span class="italic">Monumental Remains and Antiquities in the County of Bedford</span> (1828), and only took up the engravings again in 1836. The original series was reissued with additional plates shortly after his death.<br>
<br>Most of Fisher's literary work was published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, his earliest being a description of The Crown inn, Rochester, published in December 1789 under the pseudonym Antiquitatis Conservator. He was a regular contributor until his death but many of his book reviews and memoirs were published anonymously and can only be identified from the publisher's files. He wrote several memoirs of Anglo-Indians and missionaries, including one of Charles Grant (1746&#150;1823), published in 1823 and reprinted in 1833, and of the Revd Robert Morrison (1782&#150;1834), published in 1835. He was also said to have been a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Asiatic Journal</span>, and the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> occasionally published items from him.<br>
<br>It was Fisher's intention to add letterpress to his illustrations of the Stratford paintings to provide a history of the guild, and to the <span class="italic">Collections &hellip; for Bedfordshire</span>. However, he believed that publishers of small editions were financially put at risk by the requirement of the copyright law that copies of any literary work could be demanded by legal deposit libraries. He campaigned against the law by petitioning parliament in 1814, writing in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1817, and using his preface to <span class="italic">Monumental Remains</span> (1828) to denounce this provision in the 1818 <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span>. He restricted himself to the publication of books of plates without letterpress as this was exempt from the legal deposit requirements. His account of the Stratford guild appeared separately in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1835, and a reprint by John Gough Nichols of his Stratford illustrations with some additional plates was published the following year, after his death. Fisher's lack of any substantial published work probably accounts for his having to wait until late in life for recognition. Although he had no known interest in Scottish antiquities, he became a corresponding member of the Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth in 1821. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of Arts in 1823 and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in May 1836.<br>
<br>Fisher's religious beliefs were staunchly nonconformist. He edited the detailed statistical series which covered Bedfordshire to Derbyshire in the first seven volumes (1818&#150;23) of the <span class="italic">Congregational Magazine</span>. He was a director of the London Missionary Society, an active member of his local <span class="roman">Bible</span> society committee and of the committee of appeal for Highbury College, to which he gave generously. He was a strong supporter of the campaign to abolish slavery in the British colonies, writing and publishing a pamphlet for children, <span class="italic">The Negro's Memorial, or, Abolitionist's Catechism</span> (1825).<br>
<br>Fisher never married and lived for most of his life with his sister in the Hoxton district of Shoreditch, London, at 163 Hoxton Street from at least 1804 until about 1820, and then at 6 Gloucester Terrace (later incorporated into Pitfield Street). He was a guardian of the poor for Shoreditch. The writer of his lengthy obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (October 1836) suggested that his life had probably been shortened by the earnest pursuit of his work on the <span class="italic">Collections &hellip; for Bedfordshire</span>; however, a dog bite, mentioned in his will of April 1836, may have contributed. Fisher died at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, on 20 July 1836 and was brought from Gloucester Terrace to be buried at Bunhill Fields burial-ground, City Road, Finsbury, on 26 July. His extensive collection of drawings, prints, and books was sold by auction (at Southgates on 15 March and from 31 August, and by Evans from 30 May 1837) and dispersed. One item in Southgates' second sale, believed to have been owned by Thomas Fisher, was the Henry de Blois dish, now in the British Museum, and regarded as the greatest of the museum's medieval enamels.<br>
