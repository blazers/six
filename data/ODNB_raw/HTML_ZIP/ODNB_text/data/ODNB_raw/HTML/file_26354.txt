<span class="headword">Steevens,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1705, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, baptized at the parish church of West Hanningfield, Essex, on 17 February 1705, was the fifth son of John Steevens, a captain in the army, and his wife, Elizabeth. His brother George Steevens was the father of the Shakespearian commentator, also George. Charles was promoted a lieutenant in the navy on 19 March 1729. For the next two years he was on half pay, and in February 1731 he was appointed to the <i>Salisbury</i>, in which he served for upwards of five years, both on the home station and afterwards in the Mediterranean. In December 1737 Steevens was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Falmouth</i>, commanded by Captain William Douglas, which sailed for the coast of Guinea with Captain George Anson.<br>
<br>On 28 May 1738, at St Iago off the Cape Verd Islands, the <i>Falmouth</i> was detached to go to Jamaica. Anson, for reasons never explained, gave Steevens a copy of Douglas's orders. The next day Steevens, after holding a council of the commissioned and warrant officers of the ship, and in &#145;conjunction&#146; with them, confined Captain Douglas in his cabin &#145;for the preservation of their lives&#146;, he being &#145;disordered in his senses&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 51/4187, log of the <i>Falmouth</i>, 29 May 1738). On arriving at Jamaica (20 June) Steevens reported the circumstance to Commodore Charles Brown, the commander-in-chief. Brown went on the <i>Falmouth</i> on 21 June and released Douglas from confinement. Douglas then demanded that Steevens and the other officers should be tried for mutiny; but there were many difficulties in the way of holding a court martial, not least the absence of Anson. Brown, too, was convinced that Steevens had acted in good faith; and finally Douglas consented to receive an apology, which was formally given on 6 July on the <i>Falmouth</i>'s quarterdeck before Brown and all the captains then in port, when &#145;Lt Stevens in his name and the name of all the officers of the ship asked my pardon for they having unjustly confined my person and upon which everything was brought to its proper state and tranquility&#146;  (log of the <i>Falmouth</i>, 6 July 1738). None the less, the next day Steevens was moved into the <i>Sheerness</i>; soon afterwards all of the other officers, as well as some of the midshipmen and seamen, were moved into other ships. Douglas remained in command of the <i>Falmouth</i> until his death in May 1741.<br>
<br>In May 1740 Steevens was moved into the <i>Princess Louisa</i>, and on 25 March 1741 he was promoted by Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon to the command of the fireship <i>Cumberland</i>, in which he was present at the unsuccessful attack on Cartagena. On 12 June he was moved into the fireship <i>Phaeton</i>, and on 14 October he received an order to command the <i>Ludlow Castle</i>, to which he was formally commissioned on 11 January 1742. In 1743 he was commanded to convoy the trade to North America and England. On 8 October, in a heavy sea, the <i>Ludlow Castle</i> sprang a leak. Steevens ordered that the mizzen mast be cut away and that the upper deck guns be thrown overboard, but still she made 6 to 10 feet of water every hour. He eventually managed to get the ship into St Johns, Antigua, where she was condemned and converted into a hulk.<br>
<br>Steevens made his way back to England and in October 1744 was appointed to the <i>Portland</i> (50 guns). On 9 February 1746 he captured the French ship <i>Auguste</i> (50 guns), in the entrance of the channel, and on 19 November he captured the French warship <i>Subtle</i> (26 guns). On 14 October 1747 he took part, under Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke, in the defeat of M. de l'Etendu&egrave;re, and on 31 January 1748, in company with Captain Robert Harland, he captured the <i>Magnanime</i> (74 guns). After the peace Steevens commanded the guardship <i>Tiger</i> for three years; and in January 1755 he was appointed to the <i>Lichfield</i>, in which in March he was sent to the Leeward Islands as commodore and commander-in-chief. He returned soon after and was appointed to the <i>Oxford</i>, one of the channel squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral John Byng. In her on 14 November he captured the French <i>Esp&eacute;rance</i> (74 guns) which Byng ordered be destroyed on account of her dilapidatory state.<br>
<br>In January 1757 Steevens was appointed to the <i>Elizabeth</i>, in which he went out to the East Indies with a commodore's broad pennant, in command of a small reinforcement. Having gone in the first instance to Bombay, he did not join Vice-Admiral George Pocock at Madras until the end of March 1758. In the actions of 29 April and 3 August Steevens commanded in the second post; in the latter he was wounded by a musket-ball in the shoulder. On 6 July he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue, but he did not receive the news until the end of the year. In the spring of 1759 he moved his flag into the <i>Grafton</i>, having as his flag-captain Richard Kempenfelt, and in her he commanded in the second post, under Pocock, in the action of 10 September. When, early in the following year, Pocock left the station, Steevens remained as commander-in-chief, and in September undertook the blockade of Pondicherry, in co-operation with the land forces under the command of Colonel Eyre Coote. On 15 January 1761 the place surrendered.<br>
<br>The threat to Madras now seemed to have passed and Steevens took his squadron with a small number of soldiers to take Tellicherry on the Malabar coast. When he arrived there on 16 March he found that the fort was already in British hands so he sailed on to Bombay to clean, repair, and refit his squadron. He arrived at Bombay on 11 April 1761, but died there, probably on the <i>Norfolk</i>, on 20 May, and was buried in Bombay on the following day. He seems to have been unmarried. Steevens's will (PROB 11/875, fol. 222) makes no mention of a spouse, though he did have an illegitimate daughter, Anne Lake. In his will Steevens left his cabin furniture to his brother George, a master of a merchant ship.<br>
