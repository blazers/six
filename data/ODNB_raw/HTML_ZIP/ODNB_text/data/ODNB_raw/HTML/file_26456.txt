<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alexander</span>, fifth Lord Blantyre  (<em>d.</em> 1704), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Alexander Stewart, fourth Lord Blantyre, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Shaw of Greenock; his parents married about 1649. Nothing is known of his education or early life. He married first Margaret, eldest daughter of Sir John Henderson of Fordell, Fife, who died childless, and second, some time before 1683, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1658, <i>d</i>. 1722), daughter of Sir Robert Hamilton, Lord Pressmennan, and sister of John Hamilton, second Lord Belhaven; they had five sons&#151;Walter, Robert, John, James, and Hugh&#151;and four daughters, Marion, Frances, Helen, and Anne.<br>
<br>The exact date of Stewart's succession to the barony cannot be accurately established, so it is unclear when he first entered public life. As he succeeded some time before 1689, it is possible that he was the Lord Blantyre who sat in the parliaments of 1678, 1681, and 1685. Nevertheless, it is equally feasible that this was his father, the fourth lord.<br>
<br>What is clear is that following the revolution of 1688&#150;9 Blantyre was active in national affairs. On 14 March he took his seat in Parliament House, where he signed both the act declaring the convention a lawful meeting of the estates and the letter of congratulation addressed to the prince of Orange. On 30 March he was nominated one of the militia officers for Renfrewshire, and the following month commissioned to levy a regiment of 600 foot. This was successfully raised by July, when he wrote to the secretary of state, George Melville, Lord Melville:<blockquote>I have levied ane regiment for his Majesties service, and I hope it shall be found inferior to non of the other regiments; and this week I have advanced near eight hundred lib. [pounds] sterline for cloathing to them, and shall have them readie at a call wher ever the King shall command them; and if his Majestie think fit to honour me with his commands &hellip; I shall desire to posses life and fortune no longer than my willingnes continues to venture them for my religion and King. (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Addressed to George, Earl of Melville, 1689&#150;91</span>, 146&#150;7)</blockquote>During the battle of Killiecrankie, Blantyre's regiment was stationed at Stirling. In April 1689 he was named as a commissioner of supply for the shires of Lanark and Renfrew. Regularly present in parliament, on 31 July 1689 he swore and subscribed the oath of allegiance and took the oath of parliament. He was appointed a member of the committee for considering fines and forfeitures in May 1690. The following month he was again named as a commissioner of supply for Lanarkshire. On 10 September 1696 he endorsed the association. Almost certainly in return for this loyalty, Blantyre was awarded with a pension from King William.<br>
<br>However, despite previous conformity, in January 1701 Lord Blantyre opposed government policy concerning the territory of Caledonia. This was almost certainly due to the fact that no effort had been made to pay him his promised pension and other arrears. Consequently he was one of those who voted for an act rather than address concerning the colony. Next, on 31 January, he dissented from continuing the additional armed forces for a further four months. Consequently he adhered to the duke of Hamilton's protest against the legality of continuing the Convention Parliament after King William's death. He was one of the members who withdrew from parliament in June 1702, and was chosen by them to deliver an address to Queen Anne containing the reasons for their actions. Although the queen declined to accept the protest, she permitted Blantyre to wait upon her. He sat in parliament in May 1703, taking the oath of parliament, and subscribing the allegiance and assurance. On 11 August, in the presence of the advocate, Blantyre disputed the duke of Queensberry's instructions concerning the allocation of &#145;commissions to inferiour officers&#146;, calling him &#145;a base and impudent liar&#146;  (Hume, 125). It was alleged that as Queensberry was lord high commissioner Blantyre's words reflected on the queen. He offered to place himself in the lord constable's hands, and was placed under arrest in his own chamber. On 13 August, Blantyre gave in a petition &#145;acknowledging his undecent and unbecoming expressions&#146;  (ibid.), craving pardon of the commissioner and the house. It was ordered that on his knee he should crave pardon of Queensberry and the estates, and submit to a fine of &pound;5000 Scots. However, on his being called the commissioner dispensed with the former of these stipulations.<br>
<br>Blantyre was described by a contemporary&#151;perhaps somewhat unfairly&#151;as:<blockquote>a very busy man for the liberty and religion of his country, yet whatever party gets the better, he can never get in to the administration &hellip; very zealous for the Revolution &hellip; A little, active man, but thinks very seldom right, and can neither speak nor act, but by overdoing spoils all. He loves to be employed, and therefore is often made the finder of a party; can start the hare, but hath no other part in the chase; makes but a mean figure in his person, very short of stature, short-sighted, fair complexioned. (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>)</blockquote>Blantyre died on 20 June 1704, and was succeeded to the barony by his eldest son, Walter (1683&#150;1713). Lady Blantyre died in 1722 and was buried about 31 December that year.<br>
