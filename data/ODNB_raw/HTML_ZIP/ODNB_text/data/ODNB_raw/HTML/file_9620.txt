<span class="headword">William fitz Osbern</span>, earl  (<em>d.</em> 1071), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was from a Norman family connected with the ducal house, his father, Osbern, being nephew to Gunnor, wife of Duke Richard (I) (<i>d</i>. 996), and his mother, Emma, a niece of Duke Richard himself. Of an age with the future William the Conqueror (who was born in the late 1020s), he was raised in the ducal household, where his father was the duke's steward. The boys shared a traumatic adolescence marked by Osbern's murder, and William grew up to be Duke William's oldest and most loyal friend.<br>
<br>Once his brother Osbern had left for England about 1043, William was their father's sole heir; and in 1049 he inherited from his mother's brother Hugues, bishop of Bayeux, the vast estates which had belonged to his maternal grandfather Rodulf, count of Ivry. Probably about then he married Adelize de Tosny and together they founded a monastery at Lyre; a second abbey at Cormeilles followed a decade later. His Norman lands were extensive, their heart in the south-east around Breteuil, where about 1054 Duke William built a major castle which he entrusted to him. William fitz Osbern sought to develop Breteuil as an economic centre by allowing its burgesses extensive privileges.<br>
<br>By the mid-1060s William was using the title count of the palace (<i>comes palatii</i>) in imitation of a Carolingian office. He had long been the duke's steward and prominent in all the duchy's affairs, influential, too, in small matters like a squabble between Lanfranc and a royal clerk. He was later remembered as having persuaded the lesser barons to give adequate support for the invasion of England. He himself contributed sixty ships and fought at Hastings.<br>
<br>After 1066 William fitz Osbern was the king's right-hand man in England, wielding great power throughout the most difficult early years of Norman rule. His authority was based on the implicit trust which the king had in his ability and loyalty, not on any formal position, and to accord him a precise title would be to distort his role. Historians writing in the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth called William a &#145;palatine earl&#146;, an inappropriate translation of the title which he had used in Normandy; there were no palatine earldoms in England until the thirteenth century. Nor was he really a &#145;prototype justiciar&#146;, as David Bates called him. He was not even &#145;earl of Hereford&#146;, as he appears in most historical writing. The king certainly made him an earl (<i>comes</i>) in England in 1067, but the title was personal, not territorial, and he had comital authority not just over Herefordshire but probably throughout the southern shires where Harold Godwineson had been earl. His main base, indeed, was not Hereford but Winchester. In the king's absence he and Odo, bishop of Bayeux (<i>d</i>. 1097), were co-rulers. Together they built the castles from which others oppressed the English without restraint or the possibility of appeal. It was supposedly on Earl William's advice that the king had the monasteries searched for treasure stashed away by the English.<br>
<br>The earl also received much land, including the Isle of Wight, the lease of royal estates in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, many other manors in those shires and Oxfordshire, and at least some in Dorset, Wiltshire, Berkshire, and Worcestershire. Much of it had belonged to Earl Harold, but it was as yet early days for the Normans in England, and much more land might have come William's way had he lived. From those riches he endowed Lyre and Cormeilles and gave manors to his knights and servants, though curiously not to the principal families of Breteuil.<br>
<br>Because he had taken over as earl from Harold, William was drawn into the Welsh borders and especially the district around Hereford, where he encouraged economic development by extending the privileges of Breteuil to the borough. Herefordshire had been severely disrupted by Welsh incursions in Edward the Confessor's time, though the advantage had already been turned against them by Harold's decisive victories in 1063&#150;4. Earl William secured the Welsh border with castles, notably Chepstow, where he immediately began building in stone, as opposed to the earthwork and timber structures at Wigmore, Clifford, Ewyas Harold, and Monmouth. From those bases he pushed into Brycheiniog and Gwent, where he fought and defeated at least three Welsh kings, Cadwgan ap Meurig and the brothers Rhys and Maredudd ab Owain. Within at most four years he had laid the foundations of the southern marches, taking much land from the Welsh of Gwent for himself and his men and establishing an embryonic division into an &#145;Englishry&#146; and a &#145;Welshry&#146;.<br>
<br>At the same time William remained active in the king's service in England and Normandy. In 1068 he and the Breton Count Brian led an army against English rebels at Shrewsbury and Exeter, and in 1069, after York was sacked, he went north with the king and was put in charge of a new castle there. Some time after Christmas 1070 the king sent him to govern Normandy with Queen Matilda, probably with an eye on Flanders; from there he led a token force, apparently only ten knights, to join the French army which invaded Flanders to assist young Count Arnulf against his uncle Robert the Frisian. They were ambushed at Kassel on 20 or 21 February 1071 and William was killed. His men carried their lord's body back to Normandy for burial at Cormeilles.<br>
<br>William's wife, who apparently died before him, was buried at Lyre. The king made their elder sons, William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9661/', "Roger de Breteuil (fl. 1071&#150;1087)")</script>, their father's heirs in Normandy and England respectively. A third son, Rodulf, was a monk at Cormeilles, and the only known daughter, Emma, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11707/', "Ralph de Gael")</script> in 1075.<br>
<br>William of Poitiers wrote soon after William fitz Osbern's death of his physical courage, strength of character, and wise advice. Two anecdotes were remembered at Battle Abbey, among a wealth of stories about the Hastings campaign. If accurately remembered, they illustrate his quick mind and a persuasive way of talking. During the landing at Pevensey, Duke William fell, cut himself, and bled. Many of his soldiers feared a bad omen for the battles to come, but Earl William raised their spirits by interpreting it as a sign of success: the duke had grasped England with both hands, he said, and had consecrated the land with his own blood. Later, preparing for battle, the duke was handed his mail shirt back-to-front, another portent of bad luck. Working harder this time, the earl offered the comment that things which were the wrong way round would soon be put right, by a Norman victory. Earl William's qualities were elaborated by twelfth-century historians, unanimous in their praise except for William of Malmesbury's incredible moralistic tale that in 1071 he was intent on marrying Count Arnulf's mother and ruling Flanders himself. For Orderic Vitalis he was the bravest of the Normans, renowned for generosity, ready wit, integrity, and loyalty; even William of Malmesbury thought him &#145;better than the very best princes&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 2.314). Orderic spoke for all in saying that he was &#145;universally mourned&#146;, at least by the Normans  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 2.284&#150;5).<br>
