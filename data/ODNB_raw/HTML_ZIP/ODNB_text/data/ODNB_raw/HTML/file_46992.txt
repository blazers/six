<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferens,  Thomas Robinson</span>  (1847&#150;1930), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 4 May 1847 at East Thickley, near Bishop Auckland, the third of the seven children of George Waller Ferens (1817&#150;1893), flour miller, of New Shildon, co. Durham, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson. He was educated at Bishop Auckland private school until the age of thirteen, when he became a clerk in the Shildon office of the mineral department of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. In 1866, aged nineteen, he left home and went to Stockton as a clerk to Head, Wrightson &amp; Co. Raised as a devout Wesleyan Methodist and teetotaller&#151;he remained so all his life&#151;Ferens spent many of his non-working hours attending chapel and Band of Hope meetings, and teaching in Sunday school. He also played cricket regularly, and passed winter evenings teaching himself grammar, arithmetic, mechanics, and shorthand, practising the latter in chapel by copying down sermons. This autodidactism underpinned one of his lifelong maxims, namely &#145;whatever position you occupy, make yourself indispensable&#146;.<br>
<br>In April 1868 Ferens moved to Hull as shorthand and confidential clerk to James Reckitt, one of several Quaker brothers running a successful firm manufacturing household wares such as starch, washing blue, and black lead. His energy and thoroughness soon impressed his employers. In 1874 he was appointed works manager, with a share in profits. As manager he insisted upon punctuality from the workforce, with his own impeccable timekeeping as an example. He also keenly pursued productivity gains. On one occasion Ferens asked a female worker to see how many bags she could tie inside a minute, and then set the daily target for the factory by the outcome. On 11 September 1873 he married Esther Ellen (Ettie) Field, a merchant's daughter, whom he had met as a fellow teacher in the Brunswick Sunday school, where they both continued to teach throughout their lives. In 1880 they adopted Ettie's nephew, John Johnson Till, whose mother had been widowed. Till Ferens became estranged from his adoptive parents during the First World War, following a separation from his wife.<br>
<br>Ferens became secretary of Reckitts in 1879 and in 1880 general manager. In 1888 Reckitts became a public company with a capital of &pound;450,000, and he became a director. The firm expanded rapidly, especially overseas, with Ferens and James Reckitt as the driving force. Ferens was remembered in these years as being &#145;very tall and spare and elastic, always walking with a spring, and inspiring energy by example&#146;. He could appear patriarchal to his employees, but had a kindly disposition, a charming smile, and a sense of humour. He understood the importance to Reckitts of strong brand names, product quality, and backward integration to secure raw material supplies. With the great increase in turnover, profits, and capital&#151;&pound;1.97 million by 1913&#151;the value of Reckitts shares multiplied. This formed the basis of Ferens's personal fortune; in 1911 his net estate was worth, by his own estimation, &pound;650,000. Ferens became joint chairman upon the death of Sir James Reckitt in 1924.<br>
<br>In 1894 Ferens was appointed a JP and became increasingly involved in public affairs. In 1900 he was defeated as Liberal parliamentary candidate for East Hull, but he stood successfully in 1906 and held the seat for thirteen years. He gave up the day-to-day running of Reckitts, but kept in close touch with policy making. In 1911 he was given the freedom of Hull. In 1912 he was sworn of the privy council and made high steward of Hull. He was no orator, and seldom spoke in parliament, but he did chair several committees and was a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union before the First World War. A loyal supporter of Asquith, he never warmed to Lloyd George or the coalition government after 1916, and, following personal attacks on him as a Little Englander and defeat in the 1918 election, he resolved never to stand again. After the war he became an active supporter of the League of Nations.<br>
<br>From 1900 Ferens began to donate, widely and generously. He gave large sums to the Middlesex Hospital and the Victoria Hospital for Sick Children. He supported the Hull Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, the St John Ambulance Association, the NSPCA, and Yorkshire Cancer Research. In 1906 he gave recreation grounds to the Young People's Christian and Literary Institute in Hull, and the next year helped to establish Reckitts Garden Village in the city. Further gifts followed in 1912, with a boating lake in East Park and twelve almshouses, the Ferens Haven of Rest. As patron of Hull Society of Artists, he enhanced the city's art collection, in 1917 donating &pound;35,000 for a new building, opened as the Ferens Art Gallery in 1927.<br>
<br>Although childless himself, Ferens took especial interest in education. He gave large amounts to Kingswood School, Bath, Farrington's School, Chislehurst, and Leys School, Cambridge, and endowed numerous scholarships at secondary schools in Hull and elsewhere. In 1925 he donated his largest gift, &pound;250,000 and 60 acres of land, for the establishment of a university college in Hull. In all this he believed giving to be a moral duty, and carried it out with characteristic modesty, but he also enjoyed it as &#145;one of the greatest blessings of my life&#146;. By 1920 he was distributing some &pound;47,000 out of his annual income of &pound;50,000; he donated over &pound;1 million during the last years of his life.<br>
<br>Although never at the centre of fashionable society, the Ferenses entertained a wide range of guests at their garden parties at Holderness House, east Hull, and met most dignitaries visiting the city. They lived happily together, as Ferens put it, &#145;in a comparatively modest though very comfortable style&#146;. Ettie died in 1922. Ferens died at home on 9 May 1930, leaving most of his &pound;292,843 to charity, and requesting that the Reckitts shares be retained to provide future income for his bequests. He was cremated and his ashes placed next to his wife's in a vault in the grounds of Holderness House.<br>
