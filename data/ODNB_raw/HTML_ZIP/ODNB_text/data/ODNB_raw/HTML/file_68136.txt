<span class="headword">Essen,  Louis</span>  (1908&#150;1997), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 6 September 1908 in Nottingham, the younger son and second of the three children of Fred Essen, bespoke bootmaker, and his wife, Ada, daughter of Fred Edson, builder and joiner. Both parents were Strict Baptists (his grandfather Fred Edson had built the Nottingham Strict Baptist Chapel), but Essen &#145;rejected this strict form of religion from an early age&#146;, and &#145;gradually rejected all religion, forming the view that irrational beliefs lead to intolerance and bigotry causing many of the world's problems&#146;  (Essen). He was educated first at a local board school; he then won a scholarship to the Stanley Road preparatory school in Nottingham, and a county scholarship to the High Pavement School, which was then co-educational. At school he was a keen sportsman, walker, and athlete, as he remained throughout his life. He was head boy at the age of sixteen. He won a scholarship to University College, Nottingham, and graduated with a first-class London external BSc degree in 1928, aged nineteen. He began research, but left in 1929 for the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, Middlesex. There he remained until he retired in 1970. He married Joan Margery Greenhalgh, a school chemistry teacher, on 6 November 1937; there were four daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>When Essen joined the National Physical Laboratory, D. W. Dye FRS, a brilliant metrologist, was developing electrical measurements urgently needed in the infant radio industry. Essen joined him to study quartz crystal oscillators as frequency standards and to compare frequencies of radio transmitters; in one form or another frequency standards and their comparisons were his life's work and his fundamental contributions to modern electronic engineering and metrology. Dye died young in 1932, and Essen continued his work. At the outset of the Second World War, Essen's quartz crystal oscillator, with some modifications by the Post Office, was the most reliable of all sources of standard radio frequencies, and it controlled radio frequencies broadcast by the National Physical Laboratory up to 1939. Essen had also made fundamental measurements in physics. When he rotated a horizontal quartz bar oscillator about a vertical axis and found no change in the resonant frequency, he confirmed the result that Michelson and Morley found with an optical interferometer. During the war he developed ways of measuring frequencies and parameters of devices up to 30,000 MHz, the highest used in radar systems. That experience was invaluable after the war.<br>
<br>Essen exploited his wartime work to determine the speed of light. The accepted value largely depended on an extended series of experiments by Michelson over very long paths in air. Essen had investigated metal resonant cavities used in wartime as wavemeters in the field, and he pointed out that the speed of light <i>in vacuo</i> might be derived from the resonant frequency of an evacuated cavity of measured dimensions. With a cylindrical cavity resonant at about 3000 MHz he obtained a value some 16 km/sec. greater than Michelson's. That large discrepancy, the result of a novel method, was strongly doubted by some, but Essen confirmed it with an improved cavity, while K. D. Froome did so with a microwave interferometer. Essen's value was very close to the value later adopted by international convention.<br>
<br>Essen already had a high reputation when, in 1950, he visited the United States and saw work under way to establish standards of frequency based on transitions between states in atoms and molecules. He could not start immediately to build apparatus in the National Physical Laboratory, but when he and Froome determined refractive indices of atmospheric gases they did so at a frequency close to that of the hyperfine transition in caesium at about 10,000 MHz that he had selected for his proposed standard. Thus when he could begin construction, he already had a great deal of experience and equipment to hand. In less than a year he and J. V. (Jack) Parry were operating their apparatus as a regular source of standard frequencies, not just for experiments. So he was able, with W. Markowitz of the naval observatory in the USA, to relate the caesium frequency definitively to the astronomical unit of time, the ephemeris second.<br>
<br>Essen strongly advocated replacing the ephemeris second by the atomic standard of frequency and the corresponding unit of time as fundamental units, and so it was done by international agreement in 1968. The standard of length was then a wavelength in the visible spectrum of krypton; its defined value, like that of the standard of frequency, was arbitrary, and the two entailed a value of the speed of light that was subject to experimental uncertainty. Frequencies of atomic transitions can be compared with far finer discrimination than can wavelengths of atomic transitions. Essen pointed out that the speed of light might be taken to have an arbitrary conventional value, with values of lengths being derived from the times taken by electromagnetic signals to traverse them. His observation formed the basis of the modern system of standards in which fundamental quantities, electrical and mechanical, are related to frequency through quantum phenomena. His measurement of the speed of light and his establishment of the atomic frequency standard are at its heart.<br>
<br>Essen was sceptical of the accepted basis and interpretation of Einstein's special theory of relativity, but many found his criticisms unacceptable. Some of his points were valid, and although much of the discussion later seemed misguided, Essen's own experimental work and the basis he established for quantum metrology clarified the status of special relativity, namely that it expresses the fact that the only information we have of distant events is that obtained through electromagnetic signals.<br>
<br>In 1960 Essen was promoted to deputy chief scientific officer by special merit, one of very few at that time in the whole civil service. He was elected to the Royal Society in the same year. He was appointed OBE in 1959 and, among other distinctions, was the first recipient of the Wolfe award of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and the first foreign recipient of the Popov gold medal of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He died in Great Bookham, Surrey, on 24 August 1997, and was survived by his wife and four daughters.<br>
