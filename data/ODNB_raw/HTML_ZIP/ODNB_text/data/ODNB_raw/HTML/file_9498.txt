<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fisher,  John</span> <span class="st"> [St John Fisher]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1469&#150;1535), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester, cardinal, and martyr</span>, was born at Beverley, Yorkshire, the son of Robert Fisher, a mercer of Beverley, and his wife, Agnes. In the early 1480s he went up to Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1488, aged about twenty, and proceeded MA in 1491. Having become a fellow of Michaelhouse, he was ordained priest that same year in York. <h2>
<a name="CambridgeandLadyMargaretBeaufort"></a>Cambridge and Lady Margaret Beaufort</h2>Fisher advanced rapidly in the university, serving as senior proctor in the academic year 1494&#150;5. It was while on official business as proctor, visiting the king's court at Greenwich, that he met Lady Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII, an event which changed the course of his life. His talents obviously impressed her, for he was recruited to her service, becoming in due course her spiritual director. His first ecclesiastical preferment came through this connection, as in 1499 he was presented to the rectory of what was recorded as Lith by Sir Ralph Bigod, himself a client of Lady Margaret. However, Fisher continued to play an active part in university life, lecturing in the 1490s and taking his doctorate in theology in 1501. In that same year he was elected vice-chancellor of the university&#151;no doubt on account of his influential connection with Lady Margaret&#151;and in 1502 he became the first incumbent of the professorship of theology which she founded at Cambridge. In the meantime Fisher was also making other powerful friends. Richard Fox recommended him to the king, and in 1504 Henry VII made him bishop of Rochester, with papal provision following on 14 October and consecration on 24 November. In recognition of his new eminence and long service, the university promptly elected him chancellor, a post to which he was continually re-elected until 1514, when he tendered his resignation in order to allow the university to hitch its wagon to that glorious workhorse, Thomas Wolsey. When Wolsey declined this distinction, the university re-elected Fisher for life. <br>
<br>Fisher did everything to justify the confidence which the university placed in him and his powerful connections. Then, as now, academic leadership consisted to a large extent of fund-raising, and he delivered the goods. Lady Margaret's patronage had been divided equally between the universities until she met Fisher. Thereafter, her attention focused ever more exclusively on Cambridge, and her household was increasingly staffed by Cambridge graduates. She had already given money for lectureships at both universities, but under Fisher's influence these became formal endowments under royal licence. She went on to found two colleges in Cambridge, Christ's and St John's. It is impossible to document Fisher's influence on her benefactions directly, but his contemporaries were convinced that it was crucial. In later years he was at some pains to emphasize that the credit for founding St John's College belonged not to him but to Lady Margaret, an anxiety which itself reflects the common perception of his role. It has also been plausibly suggested that it was Fisher, by means of an oration delivered in the presence of Henry VII and Lady Margaret in 1507 in the as yet unfinished chapel of King's College, who persuaded Henry to bequeath &pound;5000 for the completion of that chapel. <br>
<br>Academic leadership also had its intellectual aspect, and Fisher busily fostered the progress at Cambridge of what is now called Renaissance humanism (known in its own day as &#145;good letters&#146;, &#145;bonae literae&#146;, or &#145;studia humanitatis&#146;). As early as 1506 arrangements were made for Erasmus to teach at Cambridge, and it is likely that Fisher was behind them. The plans miscarried, as Erasmus was lured to Italy instead, but it was certainly thanks to Fisher that the great humanist at last reached Cambridge to lecture in Greek and theology in 1511. Erasmus resided in Queens' College from 1511 until 1514, and this too probably reflects the influence of Fisher, who had been president there from 1505 until 1508 (presumably in order to provide him with a base when visiting Cambridge on business to do with Lady Margaret's various foundations and benefactions). <h2>
<a name="SecuringStJohnsCollege"></a>Securing St John's College</h2>It was through his role in the establishment and organization of St John's College, though, that Fisher had his most enduring impact upon the academic life of Tudor Cambridge. Formally founded in 1511, the college was beset with problems from the start, as both Lady Margaret's former household servants and the king struggled to get a share of the vast endowment she had settled on the college. Fisher led Lady Margaret's executors in resisting these predatory raids, albeit with limited success, since Henry VIII insisted on having his share. St John's finally opened for academic business on 29 July 1516, and in that year Fisher first promulgated statutes for its governance. These statutes made his intentions clear: St John's was to be a &#145;trilingual&#146; college along the lines of the humanist Collegium Busleiden at Louvain University. Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, the &#145;sacred&#146; languages, were the only tongues to be used by members of the college within its precincts (a provision surely more programmatic than practical). Over the next few years Fisher did his best to translate these pious aspirations into reality. He persuaded Henry VIII to disburse moneys for the support of university lectureships in Greek and Hebrew. The first incumbents of these unestablished posts, Richard Croke and Robert Wakefield, both became fellows of the new college. In due course, Wakefield came to hold his fellowship on a chantry foundation which Fisher himself established within the college from his own resources. Neither man performed entirely to Fisher's satisfaction. Croke fell into dispute with his colleagues, and thus with Fisher, over his idiosyncratic approach to teaching and his cavalier attitude to the conventions of college life, while Wakefield had to spend much of his time abroad perfecting his own knowledge of Hebrew and other semitic languages before taking up his public duties as a lecturer in 1524. Moreover both men chose to follow the lead of Henry VIII, rather than of their original patron, in the controversy over the king's marriage which divided English politics in the later 1520s. <br>
<br>Fisher's chantry foundation in St John's, besides testifying to his entirely conventional confidence in the traditional theology and intercessory power of the Catholic church, made important contributions to the progress of humanism in St John's, which, thanks to the succession of considerable scholars whom it housed&#151;Richard Croke, Robert Wakefield, George Day, Ralph Baynes, John Redman, John Seton, Thomas Watson, John Cheke, Roger Ascham, John Christopherson, and many more&#151;was, until Henry VIII's foundation of Trinity College in 1546, foremost among the colleges of Cambridge. <br>
<br>Nor were Fisher's interests in humanism limited to patronage. Through his association with Erasmus, Fisher became ambitious to learn Greek, and for a while, in 1516, he had Erasmus himself for a tutor, as the latter stayed briefly at Rochester during his last visit to England. While he probably never attained great proficiency in the language, he acquired at least a working knowledge, enough to enable him to use Erasmus's edition of the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and to argue points of Greek with his opponents in the theological polemics which occupied so much of his attention in the 1520s. At the same time as he was beginning Greek, he also made a start upon Hebrew. Erasmus had helped to interest him in the work of the great German Hebraist, Johannes Reuchlin, and became an intermediary between them. As a result, Fisher began to study Hebrew under the guidance of Robert Wakefield. Again, it was at best a working knowledge that he acquired&#151;but this was to come in handy during the controversy over Henry VIII's marriage. Like many early Tudor bishops Fisher employed part of his revenues to exploit the new opportunities afforded by the printing press and accumulate a magnificent library. His collection was reckoned one of the greatest of its day, and he formally donated it to St John's, to be delivered after his death. Sadly for the college, his library was seized by royal commissioners with all his other goods when he was attainted of treason, and the college, despite years of pleading, never vindicated its claim (Roger Ascham was still writing plaintive letters about this to the duke of Somerset more than ten years after Fisher's execution). <h2>
<a name="BishopofRochester"></a>Bishop of Rochester</h2>The see of Rochester was commonly given to worthy theologians, and Henry VII seems to have made this particular nomination in a fit of conscience, seeking to make some amends to God for his habitual exploitation and manipulation of the episcopate for political or merely financial purposes. Certainly Fisher never showed any intention of emulating the political careers of bishops like John Morton and Richard Fox, but then he was (unlike them, both lawyers) a theologian. It was later reported that Fisher turned down offers of translation to wealthier sees, such as Lincoln and York, and this would indeed be in character although the reports are much later and may be mere pious legend. In the conduct of his episcopate Fisher set out to be an exemplary bishop, and later generations looked back on him as such even in the fervour of the Catholic Reformation. His record of residence was impressive, although given that his see was so close to London and that he had no diplomatic and few governmental responsibilities, there was little enough to draw him away. It is significant that the only time Fisher was considered for weighty service abroad was in the context of the Fifth Lateran Council, for which he was twice nominated by Henry VIII as one of the English delegation. Each time, hostilities between England and France frustrated his mission. Fisher left England only once, to attend the summit meeting of the kings of those two countries on the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. Characteristically, the only allusion to that magnificent display in his writings is as an image for the transience of worldly glory. <br>
<br>The evidence for Fisher's pastoral zeal is both anecdotal and archival. His dedication to duty was praised in his own lifetime by no less a critic than Erasmus, who frequently cited the bishop of Rochester as a model of his calling. The early biography of Fisher asserts that he was assiduous in pastoral work, and the evidence of his episcopal register confirms this, showing that he traversed the diocese regularly and held formal visitations every three years, in accordance with canon law. Unlike many bishops, he personally carried out almost all the ordinations in his diocese, besides presiding regularly in person at abbatial elections and personally performing many of the special sacramental and ceremonial functions which his fellow bishops often delegated to suffragans. He had a high regard for the priestly office, and his vigilance in the matter of clerical appointments is suggested by the facts that his diocese had a higher than average proportion of graduate clergy and that the clergy he himself collated within the diocese were almost all scholars, usually from Cambridge and mostly from colleges with which Fisher himself was associated, such as St John's, Christ's, and Queens'. <br>
<br>Preaching was one of John Fisher's foremost pastoral and academic concerns. The early biography commented upon his activity as a preaching bishop, and the statutes he drafted for St John's College made the training of preachers one of its express aims. As vice-chancellor of Cambridge he had induced Lady Margaret to endow a preachership as well as the theology professorship, and he had secured from Rome papal privileges enabling the university to license graduates to preach anywhere in the kingdom. Lady Margaret herself esteemed him highly for his preaching, and his first published work was a series of ten sermons on the seven penitential psalms which were originally delivered in her household, and which were printed at her request. These sermons, based on a widely used devotion, were frequently reprinted and proved remarkably popular until the English Reformation superannuated a theology which was suffused with the sacramental and penitential practices of late medieval Catholicism. Fisher was high on the list of preachers suitable for great public occasions, and his other surviving sermons are mostly set pieces. In 1509 he preached at the funeral of Henry VII and at the &#145;month's mind&#146; (thirty days after the funeral) of Lady Margaret. In 1521 he preached at the promulgation in London of the papal bull against Martin Luther, and in 1526 at the recantation of Robert Barnes. All his sermons combine the tripartite structure favoured by the scholastics with a concern for the appropriate exegesis of scripture which was becoming more fashionable, thanks to the influence of humanism. Although his prose is somewhat excessively decorated and elaborate for modern taste, it was clearly to the taste of his time, and his apt and effective images testify to a genuinely creative intellect. <h2>
<a name="Opponentofheresy"></a>Opponent of heresy</h2>The image of Fisher abetting Archbishop Warham of Canterbury in torturing the Lollard martyr John Browne by applying hot coals to his feet is doubtless a figment of the imagination of John Foxe's informant. But Fisher certainly experienced considerable anxiety over the emergence of protestant heresy (he showed nothing like the same degree of concern with native Lollardy). He preached at the first burning of Luther's books in England in May 1521, and enthusiastically followed his sovereign's lead in writing against Martin Luther. He took part in the proceedings against Robert Barnes early in 1526, preaching at the friar's recantation, and in those against Thomas Bilney and Thomas Arthur in 1527. Heresy at Cambridge was particularly worrying for him. In 1521 he made several trips to Cambridge to preach anguished sermons calling for the repentance of a student who had defaced a poster announcing indulgences for those who &#145;with word and deed withstood this new develish and pernitious doctrine set forth by Luther&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vie Du bienheureux Martyr Jean Fisher</span>, 10.229&#150;35). And in 1527 the identification as a heretic of Thomas Arthur, a fellow of his beloved St John's College, disturbed him so much that in the next recension of the college statutes (1530) he introduced an extraordinary provision permitting the master and senior fellows to eject from the college summarily any member so much as suspected of heresy (this power was never in fact used). He also supported the efforts to combat heresy in Cambridge made by his friend Nicholas West, bishop of Ely. <h2>
<a name="Polemicaltheologian"></a>Polemical theologian</h2>The anguish which the very idea of heresy induced in Fisher helps explain why, in the 1520s, he devoted so much of his time to combating the new &#145;evangelical&#146; doctrines (which would come to be called &#145;protestant&#146;) that were spreading from Germany and Switzerland throughout much of Europe. However, Fisher's first essays in polemical theology were in fact contributions to a humanist controversy. The French humanist Jacques Lef&egrave;vre d'&Eacute;taples had questioned in print the traditional identification of Mary Magdalene with both Mary of Bethany (the sister of Martha and Lazarus) and the sinful woman who anointed Christ's feet in the house of a Pharisee (<span class="roman">Luke</span> 7). Lef&egrave;vre's challenge to the tradition which underpinned the immensely popular cult of Mary Magdalene provoked a scandal. It was by no means obvious that Fisher would take issue with Lef&egrave;vre. He had supported both Reuchlin in the controversy over Hebrew books and Erasmus in the controversy over the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and his initial response to the Magdalene controversy (voiced in an earlier conversation with Cardinal Campeggi) was to agree with Lef&egrave;vre that two distinct women had been conflated in popular tradition. However, invited to reconsider the matter by the bishop of Paris, &Eacute;tienne Poncher, who was in England on diplomatic business in 1518, Fisher examined it in more detail and concluded that Lef&egrave;vre was wrong. Discovering just how far back the identification of the two women as one could be traced (at least to the time of Origen) led him to reclassify it as an ecclesiastical tradition sanctioned by both high scholarship and public worship. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that his judgement should not be seen as knee-jerk obscurantism. When, in a subsequent pamphlet, Lef&egrave;vre went on to question another, more recent, popular belief, that St Anne was the mother of another three Marys (the Virgin Mary, Mary the mother of James and John, and Mary the wife of Cleophas), Fisher felt able to endorse his scepticism, while still insisting on the far more venerable tradition about the Magdalene. The Magdalene controversy was in the event rapidly eclipsed by the dramatic emergence of Martin Luther, and the obscurity into which it fell is sufficiently indicated by the fact that only one of Fisher's three books on the subject came into the hands of the compiler of his <span class="italic">Opera omnia</span> in 1597. But the high sense of the authority of the church and of ecclesiastical tradition which Fisher formulated in that first controversy characterized all his later polemics. <br>
<br>Fisher's reputation as a theologian rests on his writings of the 1520s, against Martin Luther and later Johannes Oecolampadius. It was Henry VIII himself who led the way, composing his <span class="italic">Assertio septem sacramentorum</span> early in 1521 as a refutation of Luther's famous diatribe, <span class="italic">The Babylonian Captivity of the Church</span>. With Henry's approval, the papal bull against Martin Luther, <span class="italic">Exsurge domine</span>, was formally promulgated for England by Cardinal Wolsey in a grand ceremony outside St Paul's on Sunday 12 May 1521. Fisher was chosen to preach the sermon, which was published soon afterwards. The bishop was in fact already at work on a much lengthier and more scholarly refutation of Luther, and the sermon, an effective little rebuttal, adumbrates some of its main lines of attack. In particular, it was notable for picking out three of the fundamentals of Luther's doctrine: the thesis of justification by faith alone, the ultimate appeal to scripture alone, and the denial of papal authority. The same three points received exhaustive attention in his <span class="italic">Assertionis Lutheranae confutatio</span> (1523), as did the issue of free will (together with shorter discussions of a number of lesser issues). The defence of, and subsequent appeal to, the authority of the church were fundamentals of Fisher's response. But equally important was his whole analysis of Luther's theology which played a major part in shaping not only the Catholic response to Luther but also the Catholic understanding of Luther. Fisher's <span class="italic">Confutatio</span> was one of the most frequently reprinted and widely quoted Catholic polemics against Luther, and many of the bishops and even theologians at the Council of Trent knew whatever they knew of Luther largely from Fisher's refutation. <br>
<br>The early 1520s saw Fisher compose two other works against Luther: <span class="italic">Defensio regiae assertionis</span>, a defence of Henry's <span class="italic">Assertio</span> against Luther's vitriolic counter; and <span class="italic">Sacri sacerdotii defensio</span>, a vindication of the Catholic understanding of the priesthood. These were published together at Cologne in 1525. In the meantime, he had also published another treatise, the <span class="italic">Convulsio calumniarum Ulrichi Veleni</span> (1522) which maintained, quite effectively, against a challenge mounted by a central European evangelical humanist, Ulrich Velenus, the traditional report that the apostle Peter had exercised a ministry in Rome and met his death there. <br>
<br>Fisher's other major work was his <span class="italic">De veritate corporis et sanguinis Christi in eucharistia</span> (1527), a massive reply to a pamphlet by the Swiss evangelical humanist Johannes Oecolampadius, which had tried to argue on scriptural and patristic grounds against the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the consecrated elements of the eucharist. Like the earlier <span class="italic">Confutatio</span>, the <span class="italic">De veritate</span> was one of the most widely cited Catholic polemics of its time and was much used at the Council of Trent. Although hardly decisive in the context of a theological controversy which has raged without intermission to this day, its remorseless thoroughness (clearly dependent on Fisher's excellent library) exposed many holes in Oecolampadius's much vaunted patristic scholarship, and subsequently served many later Catholic polemicists (for instance, Richard Smyth and William Peryn) as a convenient handbook for arguments and proof texts on the subject. <br>
<br>Fisher's career as a polemical theologian closed, as it had opened, with a humanist rather than a Reformation controversy. Richard Pace, the dean of St Paul's, had studied Hebrew under the guidance of Robert Wakefield in 1527, and published as the first fruits of his study a sort of extended flyer for a new Latin version of the book of <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>, revised against the original Hebrew: the <span class="italic">Praefatio in Ecclesiasten recognitum ad Hebraicam veritatem</span> ([1527]). This pamphlet sought to justify the new translation in advance, and in doing so launched a pre-emptive strike against the most powerful counter-argument, namely the contention that the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> version of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, on which the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> was based, was itself an inspired text, and therefore equivalent in authority to the Hebrew. Fisher's problem with this was again based on ecclesiastical tradition&#151;in this case a particular tradition of venerable antiquity. Observing, in general rightly, that the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> tended to follow <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> rather than Hebrew readings in citing the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, he maintained both that the inspiration of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> thus presumed and endorsed the inspiration of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, and in turn that denial of the inspiration of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> would undermine the credibility of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> itself. He also demonstrated beyond doubt the high regard in which the early Christian fathers held the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> version. In the event, his quarrel with Pace seems to have been amicably settled. Pace's <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> never appeared, Fisher's refutation of his preface was never published and survives only in one autograph manuscript, and even Pace's <span class="italic">Praefatio</span> survives in only one copy, suggesting that it may have been withdrawn from the market. <br>
<br>By this stage Fisher seems to have decided that polemical theology was not the most effective means of dealing with heresy. He may even have realized what was certainly the case, that refutations could help spread the ideas they sought to suppress. At any rate, when Johannes Cochlaeus, an indefatigable German Catholic controversialist, urged him to write against the ideas of the Anabaptists, he replied that he was no longer interested in such activities, and that he wished henceforth to devote himself to prayer and to his pastoral duties. <h2>
<a name="Thekingsdivorce"></a>The king's divorce</h2>What radically changed the proposed course of what Fisher doubtless already saw as his final years, as it radically changed the course of English, British, and perhaps even European history, was &#145;the King's Great Matter&#146;, Henry VIII's decision in the later 1520s to rid himself of his post-menopausal first wife and marry a younger woman in the hope of begetting a son. His grounds were of course that, as Katherine of Aragon had previously been married to his late elder brother, Prince Arthur, her second marriage to Henry contravened divine law, and was therefore, despite a papal dispensation, invalid. As the realm's most respected theologian, Fisher was inevitably consulted at an early stage, in 1527. Politically, he did not get things right. The case was initially aired as a scruple of the king's conscience, and Fisher na&iuml;vely set out to allay Henry's fears. Although he conceded that the scriptural evidence regarding marriage to a deceased brother's wife was ambiguous, he was unshakeable in his confidence in the scope of papal authority both to resolve doubts about scripture and also to grant matrimonial dispensations from all but the most fundamental of kinship restrictions. In effect, Fisher emerged from the start as the principal supporter of Katherine, whose Spanish and royal upbringing led her to insist imperiously and inflexibly upon the legitimacy of her marriage and her rank. As the extent of Henry's personal investment in this matter became apparent, Fisher devoted more and more effort to the scholarly questions it raised about scriptural interpretation, divine and natural law, and papal power. He lost count of the treatises he wrote on the case, and later commented that he had never put so much effort into anything else. A printed book (<span class="italic">De causa matrimonii</span>, 1530), three substantial manuscripts, and various other fragmentary texts still survive to bear out his comment. <br>
<br>In the first years of the Great Matter, before its full potential for political upheaval became clear to those involved, Fisher's contributions were primarily theological. He worked on a statement of the case for the validity of the marriage (in the form of a scholastic &#145;quaestio&#146;, asking &#145;Whether a marriage in which the pope has granted a dispensation for a man to marry his brother's wife is firm and indissoluble?&#146;) which set the agenda for discussion in this phase of the story. The task of finding answers to Fisher's arguments fell, ironically, to Fisher's former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Robert Wakefield, who was recruited to the king's cause in the summer of 1527. This inevitably led to a sharp cooling of feeling between the two men. Fisher seems to have regarded Wakefield's transfer to the king's service in this matter as a betrayal, and Wakefield's initially respectful tone towards the bishop soon gave way to efforts to edit Fisher out of accounts he gave of his own career. Wakefield found himself displaced on Fisher's foundation in St John's College by a more reliable Hebraist, Ralph Baynes, who loyally followed Fisher's lead on religious matters in the years ahead. Wakefield and Fisher continued to exchange views through 1528 and into 1529, when, in the run-up to a formal public trial of the case, Fisher heard rumours that Wakefield had found something new, and allegedly decisive, in the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. <br>
<br>The first stage of opposition culminated in a tribunal to consider the validity of the king's marriage which was held in the London Blackfriars in summer 1529 under the aegis of cardinals Campeggi and Wolsey. The hearing itself was inconclusive, as Katherine refused to recognize its jurisdiction and appealed immediately to Rome, while Campeggi, after a few days of inconsequential business, revoked the case to Rome. But the proceedings did see the tabling of various written statements on behalf of the two parties, and the most notable episode, after the majestic appearance and disappearance of Katherine herself, was an outspoken oration by Fisher in defence of the marriage. Avowing himself willing to die for the sanctity of the marriage bond, and likening himself on these grounds to John the Baptist (whose feast day was nigh), Fisher implicitly cast Henry VIII as Herod and Anne Boleyn as Salome&#151;motifs taken up by Fisher's later hagiographers. Fisher had a tendency to say exactly what he thought, especially at moments of high emotion. <h2>
<a name="OppositiontoHenryVIII"></a>Opposition to Henry VIII</h2>Having come out in public against the king at the Blackfriars tribunal, Fisher was Henry's most consistent English opponent over the next six years. The parliament which was summoned later in 1529 to complete the overthrow of Cardinal Wolsey, whose policy had now so spectacularly failed, also saw Henry begin the inexorable process of pressurizing the English clergy to get into line over his matrimonial affairs. Bills were introduced by the king regulating various clerical malpractices, but thus also infringing the legislative liberty of the church. When these bills were sent up from the Commons, Fisher's speech against them displayed his underlying anxieties. The only explanation he could find for the legislation, he averred, was &#145;lack of faith&#146; (that is, heresy), and he held up before his peers the example of Hussite Bohemia as a warning of the providential chastisements which might follow national apostasy. The Commons were enraged and perhaps also felt a little threatened, by the implicit charge of heresy, and complained to the king, who compelled Fisher to explain himself in what amounted to a humiliating climb-down. The bills were passed, and Fisher, along with John Clerk (bishop of Bath and Wells) and Nicholas West (bishop of Ely), appealed to the pope against them: all three bishops were promptly gaoled, albeit briefly. <br>
<br>Fisher was to the fore again in 1531, leading resistance in convocation to the recognition of Henry VIII as supreme head of the church. He may well have suggested the saving clause &#145;quantum per legem Christi licet&#146; (&#145;as far as the law of Christ allows&#146;), a measure with an inherent latitude of interpretation) with which the submission of the clergy was qualified. It is noteworthy that the delegates in the lower house of convocation who, even so, signed a protestation against the grant, included many of his associates, such as Robert Ridley, Nicholas Metcalfe, and Robert Shorton. Opposition to the divorce in Cambridge also tended to revolve around a few key figures (such as Dr John Watson, master of Christ's) close to Fisher. Fisher himself was becoming a veritable thorn in the king's flesh. The last attempts to win him over on the matter of the divorce were made in January 1531, when he and some others met for a disputation with a team led by John Stokesley. The failure of this move led some to consider more decisive solutions. An attempt was made in February to poison the bishop's soup, but it misfired. The ascetic Fisher passed the entire meal straight to his servants and to the poor who were accustomed to be fed at his gates, leaving two dead and the rest sick. On another occasion, an unknown assailant took an optimistic potshot at him in his Lambeth house from across the Thames. There is no reason to believe that Henry was involved in these plots. His own horror of poisoning was such that in response he passed a law making poisoning punishable by boiling alive, a mode of execution inflicted upon Fisher's unfortunate cook, who had been unwittingly tricked into the deed. The chances are that some less scrupulous client of the Boleyns was behind these attempts. <br>
<br>By 1532 Fisher's health was beginning to fail, and he was unable to attend the convocation which granted Henry a right of veto over ecclesiastical legislation in May that year (although letters were sent to canvass his opinion, and some headings of an argument on the authority and dignity of the priesthood which survive in his hand suggest that he at least commenced a formal and hostile response). By now, Fisher was well under way with an exhaustive response to the <span class="italic">Gravissimae censurae</span>, the pamphlet which had published Henry VIII's case for the divorce in 1531. Fisher's <span class="italic">Brevis apologia</span> was smuggled out of the country in sections by Eustace Chapuys, and no longer seems to survive in its entirety. It was clearly intended for publication, but quite possibly the <i>fait accompli</i> of the divorce, decreed by Thomas Cranmer in April 1533, rendered it pointless to proceed with what would have been an enormously expensive printing. Fisher remained a perceived threat to the regime throughout these months. He managed to attend the convocation in April 1533 which passed a denial of the pope's power to dispense for marriage to a brother's widow, himself dissenting from the majority. When, shortly afterwards, he spoke out in public against the imminent divorce, he was promptly arrested and put into the custody of Stephen Gardiner, where he remained safely immured until the middle of June, by which time Anne had been crowned queen. <h2>
<a name="Resistanceandmartyrdom"></a>Resistance and martyrdom</h2>Throughout the early 1530s Fisher was in close communication with Katherine of Aragon's most determined political supporter, Eustace Chapuys, the ambassador in England of her nephew, Charles V. Chapuys had come to England just after Wolsey's fall, and within a few months he had managed to convey one of Fisher's treatises on the divorce out of the country. He was kept right up to date with Fisher's literary enterprises on the subject, and was the channel by which several works by Fisher and others reached a wider audience. It was probably thanks to Chapuys that Fisher's only published tract on the divorce, the <span class="italic">De causa matrimonii</span>, found its way into print. As the lengths to which Henry was prepared to go in pursuit of the divorce became clearer, so too Fisher began to contemplate more radical opposition. He showed himself receptive to the potentially inflammatory message preached by the &#145;Holy Maid of Kent&#146; (Elizabeth Barton), granting her an audience, and listening to her predictions of disaster for Henry and his kingdom should the divorce go ahead. <br>
<br>The Holy Maid had a remarkably wide following among the clergy and nobility of the realm, or at least among those portions of those two estates who were sympathetic to the cause of Queen Katherine, a sympathy which tended to be combined with profound hostility to the sort of religious reform already becoming fashionable among the circles sympathetic to Anne Boleyn. It was among this &#145;Aragonese&#146; faction (as it has sometimes been called) that Chapuys began to canvass support for possible imperial and papal action against Henry VIII should he proceed with his plans. By the beginning of 1532 Fisher was receiving instructions and advice from Charles V via Chapuys. Their contacts had clearly gone far beyond merely publishing treatises. By the end of September 1533 Chapuys was transmitting to Charles V Fisher's opinion that the papal condemnation of Henry's divorce and remarriage would be ineffectual unless supported by the might of the empire, and that such intervention would be tantamount to a crusade. Fortunately for Fisher, the king and his ministers never discovered his contacts with Chapuys&#151;or at least, never found any evidence about their treasonable content. <br>
<br>That the regime might well by this stage have entertained the most profound suspicions about Fisher's loyalty is shown in the way that he was implicated in the proceedings now being taken against the Holy Maid of Kent. After she had been induced to confess publicly to fraud, proceedings were expedited by act of attainder, and Fisher was by the same act convicted of &#145;misprision of treason&#146; and sentenced to confiscation of goods and imprisonment at the king's pleasure for having concealed the predictions she shared with him (these were all of course, as Fisher vainly pleaded in his own defence, public knowledge). Even now the regime had not abandoned all hope of&#151;if not winning Fisher over&#151;at least cowing him into submission. Had he been willing to take the &#145;oath to the succession&#146; (an oath required in 1534 of all adult males, recognizing Henry's divorce and second marriage, and implicitly repudiating papal authority), he would doubtless have been restored to full honours. But he was not, and in April he was therefore confined in the Tower of London. About the end of the year a further act of attainder deprived him of his preferments, including the see of Rochester. In the course of 1535 pressure was put on him to affirm or deny Henry's status as &#145;Supreme Head of the Church of England&#146; (which had been recognized by act of parliament late in 1534). Eventually, he seems to have uttered a denial of this title (possibly elicited by chicanery), which left him liable to the penalties of high treason under a new treason act passed that year. And so in June 1535 he was indicted, tried, convicted, sentenced, and, on Tuesday 22 June, decapitated on Tower Hill. His death, which Catholic Europe unanimously interpreted as martyrdom, was of no small importance in perpetuating after his death the reputation as a theologian which he had acquired earlier in his life. Now his witness against the innovations of his time was sealed in the blood of martyrdom&#151;and death for the truth was no longer the exclusive preserve of the protestant reformers. <h2>
<a name="Earlybiography"></a>Early biography</h2>After his death Fisher was immediately classified as a martyr by the Catholic authors and theologians of Europe. In England, the initial stirrings of a martyr's cult were promptly suppressed by a vigilant government, which forbade preachers to discuss Fisher and Thomas More as anything other than traitors. Nevertheless, the report that Fisher's head (displayed for public scorn on London Bridge) was daily growing rosier and more lifelike in appearance soon spread from England to the continent, and was recorded in a pamphlet by the Catholic polemicist Johannes Cochlaeus which attacked Henry VIII and proclaimed his victims martyrs. One of Henry's ablest propagandists, Richard Morison, was commissioned to respond to Cochlaeus's claims. The systematic elimination of Fisher's memory at St John's College, Cambridge, should properly be seen as part of the government's attempt to strangle the potential martyr's cult at birth. The tomb Fisher had built for himself in the college chapel was dismantled, his heraldic emblems (fishes and ears of wheat), liberally scattered around it, were defaced, and the college statutes were in due course redrafted to eliminate all mention of him and of the scholarships and lectureships he had founded within the college. Nevertheless, once Mary Tudor had secured the throne in 1553, Fisher's domestic reputation soon rose again. A circle of Catholic humanists associated with St John's College set about compiling materials for a biography. Although their work was unfinished when Mary died, it was carried on under the new regime, and before Elizabeth's reign was over a life of Fisher was circulating widely in manuscript. It was first printed in 1655. A critical edition by Fran&ccedil;ois van Ortroy was published by the Bollandists in two volumes, 1891&#150;3. <h2>
<a name="Finalassessment"></a>Final assessment</h2>Despite (or perhaps because of) an ascetic and uncompromising disposition, Fisher was evidently a man of considerable personal charisma. It is perhaps not surprising that a pious noblewoman of Lady Margaret's character took him up as her spiritual director: the early modern era is full of such spiritual relationships. But Fisher, like Thomas More (though in a different way), also kindled loyalty and affection in relatives, colleagues, and friends. His half-sister, Elizabeth White, remained loyal to her monastic vocation long after the closure of Dartford Priory, while scattered sources speak vaguely of relatives of Fisher who took refuge abroad after his execution. The few men who tried to stand up and be counted in resisting Henry VIII's policies in the early 1530s were for the most part connected with Fisher personally or professionally. Yet, given the relatively limited resources of Rochester, it should be concluded that it was the force of his personality rather than of his patronage which elicited this loyalty. Although St John's College was eventually to become notorious as a centre of Calvinistic puritanism, in the years immediately following his death it remained loyal to his memory, celebrating his exequies and bringing down upon itself the unwelcome attentions of the government, which, as well as systematically erasing all traces of Fisher there, compelled his right-hand man Nicholas Metcalfe to resign the mastership and overruled the college's own choice of a successor. The compilation of the early life of Fisher was the work of former fellows of St John's or episcopal chaplains, such men as John Young, Thomas Watson, and Robert Truslowe. Fisher's senior chaplain, John Addison, deserted him only at the bitter end, under the pressure of attainder and imprisonment. Another of his chaplains, George Bucker (alias Adam Damplip), fled to Rome after his master's execution (although he subsequently became a protestant and died for his beliefs). One of the fellows on his foundation at St John's, Ralph Baynes, likewise fled the country rather than take the oath to the succession. John Stokesley, Fisher's opponent over Henry's divorce, was said to have lamented on his deathbed his failure to stand by Fisher in the crisis over the break with Rome. Few of his friends and clients actively turned against him. Two of these, Richard Croke and Robert Wakefield, were, for all their talents, fundamentally unpleasant men, whose arrogance and unscrupulous ambitiousness made both of them many enemies and put fairly low ceilings on both their careers. At the end, in 1535, even Fisher's political enemies hesitated about his destruction. Archbishop Cranmer himself urged mercy. <br>
<br>Fisher's fate ultimately hinged on his relationship with Henry VIII, which went back many years. There is no evidence for the claim which is sometimes made that Fisher had been for a while Prince Henry's tutor. There may well be truth in another story, that Fisher was one of those to whose guidance Lady Margaret recommended her grandson from her own deathbed, after the death of Henry VII; certainly Fisher appeared a few times on the king's council in the next few years. If so, then he was also one of those clerical councillors (along with the more influential Warham and Richard Fox) from whose tutelage Henry in effect emancipated himself by taking England into war with France in 1513. And there were other tensions around this time, as Henry refused to allow the endowment of St John's College to the full extent stipulated by Lady Margaret's will, insisting on retaining a greater share of her lands for himself. Yet Fisher did well in this context, securing respectable compensation from Henry and persuading him to make some substantial outlays for the benefit of the university&#151;which all suggests that he maintained a good working relationship with his sovereign. Moreover, Fisher was still of value to the king. Henry VIII held him in the highest esteem as the foremost theologian of his realm, as Cardinal Pole later reminded him. In the context of the campaign against Luther in the early 1520s, Henry even bestowed upon him the ultimate mark of royal affection, the companionly arm around the shoulders. <br>
<br>Fisher was one of a series of theologians from whom, at one time or another, Henry requested a commentary on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. Fisher's elaborate attempt, incomplete, and probably interrupted by the distraction of the king's Great Matter, remains in tatters among the state papers. Another of Fisher's works, the so-called &#145;king's psalms&#146; (a dozen or so Latin meditations in the style of psalms, perhaps best described as devout pastiche or sacred parody), may have been a down payment on the larger project, and seem to have gone down well with the king. Many years later, Katherine Parr was to translate them into English and publish them under the title by which they are now known (tactfully passing over their authorship). It was another sign of royal esteem that Fisher was among the very first theologians to be approached for an opinion about the validity of the king's first marriage. This of course was what ruined their relationship. Although Fisher continued to express respect for the king's conscientious scruples, his outburst at Blackfriars in 1529 showed the way his mind was headed with its implicit likening of Henry to the tyrant Herod. Over the next few years, Henry gradually gave up on his attempts to win over or overawe Fisher, and from 1533 resorted to defamation and imprisonment; and Fisher in his turn had abandoned polite argument and persuasion in favour of strictly treasonable discussions with foreign powers. In the end, vindictive and self-righteous as ever, it was Henry himself who insisted upon the humiliation and destruction of his old friend and servant, now a sick and dying man. <br>
<br>The final provocation was, ironically, probably an attempt to save Fisher's life. On 21 May 1535 Pope Paul III added Fisher's name to the group of scholarly and reforming bishops whom he was recruiting as cardinals in the early years of his pontificate. Presumably he hoped to deter Henry from extreme measures by giving Fisher the status of a prince of the church. If so, he misread the game whose stakes he was thereby raising. Upon receiving the news of this promotion, Henry, with some black quip, variously reported, to the effect that he could give Fisher a red hat of his own, or else see he had nowhere to put it, gave orders for Fisher's execution&#151;merciful only to the extent of substituting beheading for the usual barbarities. <br>
<br>The suppression of English Catholicism which was achieved by Henry VIII and his younger daughter ensured that for centuries there would be no political pressure to regularize through canonization the reputation of martyrdom which immediately adhered to Fisher's name. However, once English Catholicism emerged from the shadows in the nineteenth century, in a world in which kings were becoming less and less relevant, formal proceedings were commenced, leading to Fisher's beatification in 1886 and his canonization in 1935. Together with Thomas More he is now commemorated by the Roman Catholic church on 22 June, the anniversary of his execution.<br>
