<span class="headword">Donisthorpe,  Wordsworth</span>  (1847&#150;1914), <span class="occ">political activist and pioneer of cinematography</span>, was born on 24 March 1847 at Springfield Mount, Leeds, the only son (there were also four daughters) of George Edmund Donisthorpe (1809&#150;1875), a worsted manufacturer, wool merchant, and later colliery proprietor, who in the 1840s had invented a wool combing machine, and his wife, Elizabeth Wordsworth (1821&#150;1881). He was educated at Leeds grammar school and Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1869 he took a first in the moral sciences tripos. A year later he was admitted to the Inner Temple, but he was not called to the bar until 1879. In the interim he had been arrested in Strasbourg for taking part in a republican demonstration, and married (on 17 December 1873) Ann Maria, daughter of Henry Anderson, a York solicitor; they had two sons and two daughters. In 1876 he published <span class="italic">The Principles of Plutology</span>, a work that endeavoured to develop a science of wealth on the same principles as Herbert Spencer's science of society.<br>
<br>Donisthorpe was a leading figure in a variety of organizations on the margins of late Victorian politics that had as their common purpose opposition to the growing role of the state. He was an early member of the Personal Rights Association, founded in 1871 to fight the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, which had empowered the police to compel women suspected of prostitution to undergo a medical examination. In 1873 he joined with his cousin William Carr Crofts (1846&#150;1894) to found the Political Evolution Society, the aim of which was to warn of &#145;the dangerous principle underlying measures of a repressive or paternal character&#146;, and which had as its instrument the abortive journal <span class="italic">Let Be</span>. In 1880 the society was renamed the State Resistance Union in response to Lord Elcho's advocacy, in a letter to the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, of a cross-party grouping to uphold personal liberty and freedom of contract. Two years later, after the publication in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> of a further appeal by Elcho (soon to be the earl of Wemyss), and on the advice of Herbert Spencer, Donisthorpe took part in a meeting at Elcho's London home which led to the State Resistance Union being transformed into the Liberty and Property Defence League.<br>
<br>The league remained the chief campaigning group for the principles of <i>laissez-faire</i> liberalism for the rest of the nineteenth century. Its membership comprised a loose coalition of landed and commercial interests, while figures such as Auberon Herbert, Thomas Mackay, Frederick Millar, as well as Donisthorpe himself provided the league with polemical and theoretical support. In 1884 Donisthorpe published the pamphlet <span class="italic">Liberty or Law?</span>, effectively the league's manifesto, which argued for a realignment of the political parties to bring together all those individualists who were opposed to &#145;socialism&#146; (meaning any extension of the state's role beyond the nightwatchman minimum). Donisthorpe served on the league's council until 1888, and in 1887&#150;8 edited a journal, <span class="italic">Jus</span>, subsidized by the league. His final break with Wemyss occurred as a result of the latter's failure to campaign for church disestablishment.<br>
<br>The most sophisticated statement of Donisthorpe's political creed is his <span class="italic">Individualism: a System of Politics</span> (1889). His theory owed a great deal to that of Herbert Spencer, and borrowed in particular the idea that society was an organism which develops according to scientific laws of evolution. These laws, discovered by a science Donisthorpe termed &#145;nomology&#146;, reveal that only an ever-decreasing amount of state interference is consistent with social welfare, and that the ultimate goal of the evolutionary process is an anarchistic utopia (Donisthorpe occasionally referred to himself as a &#145;philosophic anarchist&#146;). While incorporating some aspects of Spencer's thought, however, Donisthorpe repudiated his &#145;metaphysical&#146; doctrine of natural rights, and drew on the positivistic conception of law associated with Hobbes and John Austin. A vigorous controversialist, his energies were as often expended in argument with fellow individualists, especially Auberon Herbert, as they were in combating what he saw as the iniquities of socialism.<br>
<br>Of Donisthorpe's other publications, the chapter he contributed to <span class="italic">A Plea for Liberty</span> (ed. T. Mackay, 1891) contains the most succinct statement of his political views. His <span class="italic">Law in a Free State</span> (1895) collects some of his articles and occasional pieces. In <span class="italic">Labour Capitalisation</span> (1887) Donisthorpe advanced the case for a form of profit-sharing and in <span class="italic">Uropa</span> (1913) he projected a &#145;philosophically-constructed&#146; international language based on Latin. As president of the Legitimation League, which sought to remove the legal disadvantages of illegitimate children, he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Law and Love: an Essay on Marriage</span> (1894), which considered how concepts of individual freedom might be applied to marriage, arguing against the intervention of the state to enforce the continuance of marriages. By 1891 he was separated from his wife and about 1911 had a daughter with Edith Georgina Fleming, whom he described as his second wife. He died of heart failure on 30 January 1914, at Shottermill, near Farnham, Surrey.<br>
<br>Donisthorpe's other interests included chess. He was on the sub-committee that drew up the rules of the London chess tournament of 1883, and as a member of the British Chess Club he took part in the international match against the Cercle des &Eacute;checs in Paris in May 1885. His posthumous reputation increasingly rested on his contribution to early cinematography. In 1876 he applied for a patent for an apparatus to take photographs at rapid intervals, to record the movement of the object being photographed. In a letter to <span class="italic">Nature</span> (24 Jan 1878, 242), prompted by a report of Thomas Edison's phonograph, he described how his kinesigraph (as his motion picture apparatus was called) could produce moving pictures: the paper prints of each image would be fixed to a long strip of paper wound from a cylinder, and as each individual picture was unwound it would be illuminated by an electric spark. In 1889, jointly with William Carr Crofts, he took out a patent for a film camera and projector, whose mechanism was possibly inspired by that of his father's wool combing machine and which utilized the new technology of celluloid film. Ten frames survive from their successful attempt, about 1890, to use the kinesigraph to expose a series of frames from a vantage point overlooking Trafalgar Square. They encountered problems in developing a workable projector, and failed to find a sponsor; after his cousin's death, in 1894, Donisthorpe seems to have dropped the project. His contribution to cinematography went largely forgotten, though his and Carr's relatives recalled their invention when the early history of the cinema was first being chronicled (see <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Aug, 9 Aug 1923) and subsequent work by film historians has shed more light on Donisthorpe's work in the field.<br>
