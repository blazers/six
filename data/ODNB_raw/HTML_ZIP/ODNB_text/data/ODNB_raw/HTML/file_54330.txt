<span class="headword">Strathbogie,  David</span>, styled tenth earl of Atholl  (<em>d.</em> 1326), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49383/', "John of Strathbogie, ninth earl of Atholl (c.1260&#150;1306)")</script>, and Marjory, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18020/', "Donald, sixth earl of Mar (d. in or after 1297)")</script>. He was the nephew of Robert Bruce, whose first wife, Isabel, was Marjory's sister. Earl John was executed in 1306 for supporting Bruce; the earldom was granted by Edward I to his son-in-law, Ralph de Monthermer, who was at that time earl of Gloucester. However, the young Strathbogie, who was married to Joan, the daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6046/', "John Comyn")</script> of Badenoch slain by Bruce in 1306, recovered his patrimony, for 10,000 marks, when he submitted to Edward in May 1307. He was then involved in the hunt for his uncle, reputedly hiding on the west coast of Scotland, from the English base at Ayr. His good service was noted by Edward II in 1308, contrary to Barbour's assertion that Atholl remained in King Robert's service. By Christmas 1307 he had left Ayr to join his wife's relative the earl of Buchan and Sir John Mowbray, as they prepared to meet Bruce's army in the north-east. This eventually resulted in the defeat of Buchan's force at Inverurie in the spring of 1308; the Comyns were now effectively expelled from Scotland for good.<br>
<br>In 1311 Atholl was sent to relieve the English garrison holding Robert's own castle of Loch Doon, which was under pressure from the Scots. He then moved up to Dundee. In 1312 he went to Roxburgh on Edward II's affairs, but may have made overtures to his uncle. While in August that year he attended a parliament in London, three months later he was present at another parliament in Inverness, witnessing the confirmation of the Scottish&#150;Norwegian treaty. King Robert's acceptance of his nephew extended so far as to make Atholl constable of Scotland in place of one of his most loyal supporters, Sir Gilbert Hay of Erroll. The earl initially repaid this trust and played a distinguished part in the capture of Perth. According to Barbour, though, Atholl fell out badly with the king's brother Edward, who allegedly seduced the earl's sister, Isabel, but refused to marry her. If so, Atholl exacted a very full revenge, attacking the Scottish store at Cambuskenneth immediately before Bannockburn, and killing its commander, Sir William Airth. He thus became the first Scottish earl to be forfeited since the twelfth century; the lands of the earldom were given to Sir Neil Campbell, who married the king's sister Mary on her release from English prison later that year. Malcolm, earl of Lennox, and Sir Adam Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1328) also benefited from Atholl's defection, as did Sir Gilbert Hay, who was restored to the constableship.<br>
<br>Back in England, Sir David Strathbogie was &#145;rewarded&#146; with three manors in Norfolk; he also regained the castle of Chilham, Kent, which had belonged to his father, in 1321 for his good service on the borders. He moved higher in Edward II's service in 1325, when he was sent on a mission to Aquitaine. On his return he was given his wife's share of the inheritance of her uncle Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke. Strathbogie died about 28 December 1326, predeceased by his wife, Joan Comyn, before 24 July 1326. Their eldest son, David, succeeded as the exiled earl of Atholl. The couple had another three children, Aymer, Isabella, and Maria.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54331"></a><span class="headword">David Strathbogie</span>, styled eleventh earl of Atholl  (1309&#150;1335)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 1 February 1309 and baptized in the church of St Nicholas in Newcastle. Edward III allowed him entry to his inheritance in July 1327, when only eighteen, and he took part in the Weardale campaign of that year. He had considerable estates in England, as well as a claim to the Scottish earldom of Atholl and half of the lands of his maternal grandfather, John Comyn of Badenoch. In 1330 he was also granted the castle and manor of Odogh in Ireland, inherited from his great-uncle Aymer de Valence.<br>
<br>As one of the &#145;disinherited&#146; Strathbogie played a key role, with Sir Henry de Beaumont, in Edward III's seizure of power in 1330 from Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. He was thus part of the young king's inner circle. Though his claims in Scotland were not officially recognized by the English government, he was allowed to pay court to Edward Balliol when the latter arrived in England in 1331, and he took part in Balliol's invasion of Scotland in 1332. He and Beaumont effectively acted as Edward III's agents with Balliol, particularly in the matter of the transfer of the counties of southern Scotland to the English king agreed in 1333 and enacted on 12 June 1334. Strathbogie was well rewarded by Balliol for his constant service, receiving Robert Stewart's lands and office. However, relations between the disinherited leaders and the Scottish king disintegrated during Balliol's parliament of February 1334 over the claim of Sir Alexander Moubray to the inheritance of his brother Philip. The quarrel came to an end only when Moubray deserted Balliol.<br>
<br>Having made great efforts to win over Stewart's men in the west, Strathbogie then went north to claim his inheritance there. John Randolph, earl of Moray, pursued him into Lochaber and eventually forced him and his men to swear allegiance to David II. That done, Strathbogie was allowed to serve as King David's lieutenant in the north, which office he performed faithfully; but a dispute arose over the control of former Comyn lands, and Strathbogie, by winning over the young Robert Stewart, caused so much dissension between Stewart and Randolph (both of whom were guardians) that a parliament in April 1335 achieved nothing. With the arrival of an English army at Perth in August Strathbogie changed sides again, still retaining his office of lieutenant. In October Balliol appointed him guardian of Scotland north of the Forth, and he acted in that office with growing ruthlessness, in his determination to root out the supporters of David II. His siege of Kildrummy Castle in Mar, held by Christian Bruce, attracted the attention of her husband, the new guardian, Sir Andrew Murray. Murray brought a force north to relieve the castle, and Strathbogie moved into the forest of Culblean to meet him. A surprise attack from the rear on 30 November 1335 brought victory to Murray, and Strathbogie was killed, fighting to the end. Strathbogie married Katherine, daughter of Sir Henry de Beaumont. She was left stranded in Lochindorb after her husband's death, but defended herself successfully against the Scots until 1336 when Edward III himself brought an English force to her rescue. She died in 1368. The couple had one son, David, who was aged three at his father's death.<br>
