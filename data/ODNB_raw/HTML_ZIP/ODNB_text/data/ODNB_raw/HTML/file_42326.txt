<span class="headword">Kropotkin, Peter <span class="st"> [Pyotr Alekseievich]</span></span>  (1842&#150;1921), <span class="occ">anarchist and scientist</span>, was born on 27 November 1842 <span class="smallcap">OS</span> at 26 Shtatny pereulok in Moscow, the son of Prince Aleksey Petrovich Kropotkin (1805&#150;1871), an army officer who came from an old aristocratic family, and Yekaterina Nikolayevna Sulima (1810&#150;1846), who was of a Cossack military family. He was educated at the Corps of Pages, the &eacute;lite military school in St Petersburg, and served as an officer in the Far East, spending much time in geographical exploration. As a boy he repudiated his title, and as a man he soon became alienated from the tsarist regime, and resigned his commission in 1867. He studied mathematics at St Petersburg University (1867&#150;8) and worked as a professional geographer, specializing in the orography and glaciology of Asia. He adopted populism and then socialism, and during a visit to western Europe in 1872 he turned to anarchism. On his return he joined the revolutionary movement in St Petersburg, working in the Tchaikovsky circle until he was arrested in 1874. He was held without trial, but escaped from prison hospital in St Petersburg in 1876 and went into exile in the West. On 8 October 1878 he married Sofiya Grigoryevna Ananyeva-Rabinovich (1856&#150;1938), a biologist and writer from a Ukrainian Jewish family, in Geneva.<br>
<br>Kropotkin soon took a leading part in the international anarchist movement, helping to shift it from the mutualism of Proudhon and the collectivism of Bakunin to a more ambitious ideology which became known as anarchist communism. After speaking and writing actively in several countries, he was arrested in France and imprisoned in 1883. When he was given amnesty in 1886 he took refuge in England, where he earned a living as a scientific journalist but also continued to develop and expound his social and political philosophy. This was a combination of biological evolution, naturalistic ethics, populist historiography, integral education, economic decentralization and self-management, political anarchy, and self-government, the final stages to be inaugurated through mass insurrection and popular revolution. He explained his ideas in lucid language and attractive arguments, remaining the best-known and best-liked figure in the anarchist movement for more than forty years, and exercising considerable and even excessive influence over it.<br>
<br>Kropotkin contributed both to leading liberal magazines and to radical papers, and he collaborated on several anarchist periodicals in several languages, helping to found <span class="italic">Freedom</span> in Britain in 1886. Some of his huge number of articles were reprinted as pamphlets and many were collected in a series of books: <span class="italic">Words of a Rebel</span> (1885), <span class="italic">In Russian and French Prisons</span> (1887), <span class="italic">The Conquest of Bread</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Fields, Factories and Workshops</span> (1899), <span class="italic">Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Modern Science and Anarchism</span> (1901, 1913), <span class="italic">Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Great French Revolution</span> (1909), and <span class="italic">Ethics: Origin and Development</span> (1922). <span class="italic">The Conquest of Bread</span> was his most impressive exposition of anarchist communism, and <span class="italic">Mutual Aid</span> was his most influential book of all. During a visit to the United States in 1897 he was commissioned to write his autobiography, <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Revolutionist</span> (1899), which became his most popular book. He contributed several scientific articles to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and also the authoritative &#145;Anarchism&#146; to the eleventh edition (1910).<br>
<br>In Britain, Kropotkin had a wide circle of friends and admirers in all walks of political and social life, and he did much to make anarchism almost respectable in progressive circles. At the end of his life he moved towards liberalism, and in the First World War he favoured the allies against the central powers, which alienated him from most of his former comrades. He was amiable and charming in company, but could be dogmatic and intolerant in controversy.<br>
<br>Kropotkin was a leading member of the Russian revolutionary movement in exile, and he supported the abortive revolution of 1905 and the successful revolution of 1917. He returned to his native land in June 1917 and settled in Moscow. He followed a moderate line and opposed the Bolshevik regime which took power in November 1917, occasionally protesting against its excesses. He moved to the village of Dmitrov, near Moscow, where he died on 8 February 1921 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. His funeral in Moscow on 13 February was the last open anarchist demonstration in Russia for more than sixty years; he was buried at Novodevichye cemetery. Kropotkin's wife, Sofiya, died in Moscow in 1938. Their only child, Alexandra, who was born in Harrow in 1887, lived in several European countries before settling in the United States, where she died in 1966.<br>
