</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ramsay,  James</span>  (1733&#150;1789), <span class="occ">surgeon and slavery abolitionist</span>, was born on 25 July 1733 at Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, the only son of William Ramsay (1683&#150;1754), ship's carpenter, and his wife, Margaret Ogilvie (1696&#150;1772) of Powrie. After attending Fraserburgh grammar school he was apprenticed to Dr Alexander Findlay, a local surgeon. A bursary enabled him to enter King's College, Aberdeen, and brought Ramsay under the teaching of Dr Thomas Reid (1710&#150;1796), professor of moral philosophy, who exercised a profound influence on his thinking. After obtaining the degree of MA on 9 April 1753, he continued his surgical training in London with Dr George Macaulay, physician and treasurer of the British Lying-in Hospital. He passed his examination to enter the navy on 2 June 1757 and was appointed to the <i>Arundel</i>, a sixth rate of 24 guns and 160 men, on the West Indies station, where he came under the command of Sir Charles Middleton. The <i>Arundel</i> intercepted the British slave ship <i>Swift</i>, ravaged by dysentery, on 27 November 1759 and, on boarding her, Ramsay found over 100 slaves wallowing in blood and excreta, a scene of human degradation which remained for ever in his memory and so distracted his attention that, on returning to his ship, he fell and fractured his thigh bone. It was the more serious of two such accidents and he remained lame for life.<br>
<br>With an end to his naval service in prospect, Ramsay sought ordination in the Anglican church to enable him to work among slaves. He returned to Britain in July 1761, left the navy in September, and was ordained by the bishop of London in November. He departed almost immediately for St Kitts, where he was appointed to St John's, Capisterre (1762), and to Christ Church, Nicola Town (1763). In 1763 he married Rebecca Akers (<i>d</i>. 1804), daughter of a well-connected planter; they had a son, who predeceased him, and three daughters. Responding to a local need, he practised his skills in surgery and midwifery, but provided a free service to the poor. He was also appointed surgeon to several plantations and this enabled him to see the conditions under which slaves laboured, the brutality of many owners and overseers, and the mutilating punishments and cruel injustice meted out to them. His sympathy for disadvantaged settlers led to involvement in local government and he proposed a more equitable taxation system, while his naval experience was reflected in his <span class="italic">Essay on the Duty and Qualifications of a Sea Officer</span> (1765), which was highly acclaimed and translated into a number of other languages.<br>
<br>Ramsay's interest in the welfare of slaves was encouraged by people of integrity, but aroused the antagonism of influential planters and local government officials who, facing ruin, attempted to manipulate the interest rate in their favour to the detriment of honest and thrifty citizens. Ramsay felt it his duty to challenge this illegal scheme and became the target of verbal abuse, scurrilous pamphlets, and letters to newspapers. He was deprived of his magistracy, privileges of the clergy were curtailed, and churchgoing discouraged. His letters to the bishop of London disclose serious disaffection among colonists at this period. They marked the beginning of his relationship with British politicians.<br>
<br>On returning to Britain in 1777 Ramsay visited his married sister Jean in Fraserburgh, adopted his nephew James Ramsay Walker, and paid for the boy's education. Walker subsequently became bishop of Edinburgh and primus of the Scottish Episcopal church. Ramsay was then received into the family of Sir Charles Middleton at Barham Court, Teston, Kent, where Lady Middleton immediately warmed to the cause of slaves. In April 1778 he rejoined the navy as chaplain to Admiral Barrington on the West Indies station. His knowledge of West Indies affairs may have influenced the appointment for he had been introduced to Lord George Germain, secretary of state for the American department, who arranged for him to supply private intelligence. Ramsay saw action against the French off St Lucia in December 1778 and off Grenada and St Kitts in July 1779. He was subsequently based in St Kitts gathering intelligence for Admiral G. B. Rodney, formed a lasting friendship with Sir Gilbert Blane, Rodney's physician, and rendered valuable service to the Jews when Rodney captured St Eustatius. During this time he prepared the material for his book <span class="italic">Sea Sermons for the Royal Navy</span> (1781), which revealed a genuine affection for the sailor, an understanding of his character, and an appreciation of his contribution to the nation. &#145;You and your fellow-combattants were a band of brothers engaged in one cause&#146;, he said  (<span class="italic">Sea Sermons</span>, 17817). It was a phrase later adopted by Nelson.<br>
<br>Early in 1779 Ramsay had been invited by Middleton, then a rear-admiral and comptroller of the navy, to assist him with a radical reform of the Navy Board and he returned to Britain with his wife and family during the latter part of 1781, to be awarded a Lambeth MA and, in January 1782, installed as vicar of Teston and rector of Nettleshead. The livings were in Middleton's gift and the rectory adjoined Barham Court, where Ramsay acted as Middleton's confidential secretary. He also appears to have initiated policy, for several papers are in his handwriting and preliminary drafts appear in his private diary. In 1782 he also took the new diploma of the Company of Surgeons, which suggests an intention eventually to resume his practice in St Kitts.<br>
<br>At Barham Court and the Middleton's London home in Hertford Street, Ramsay found himself among an influential circle of philanthropists, intelligentsia, and politicians where his account of the iniquities of the slave trade aroused vehement indignation, and Lady Middleton urged him to lay his evidence before the nation. His <span class="italic">Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies</span> appeared in 1784 and was the most important event in the early history of the anti-slavery movement. In this work he reviewed the status of slaves in history, their moral rights, their ill treatment in British colonies, and the influence of nutritional deficiency, overwork, and mutilating punishments upon morbidity, mortality, and output, with examples of the benefits of enlightened management. Nevertheless he foresaw the problems of precipitate emancipation and proposed a programme of preparation which would encompass education, Christian teaching, the inculcation of family and social values, and the passing of equitable laws. The book received immediate acclaim but was followed by a flood of vituperation from the planter community in anonymous letters to national and colonial newspapers, which Ramsay countered effectively in his <span class="italic">Reply to Personal Invectives</span> (1785). Meanwhile, in <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Effects of Putting a Stop to the African Slave Trade</span> (1784) he advocated the development of a mixed economy on the African coast for emancipated slaves who would trade their produce for British manufactures. This book impressed Pitt and William Wilberforce.<br>
<br>During this period Ramsay was acting as Middleton's secretary and, in addition to the reorganization of the Navy Board, was involved in the settlement of Australia. He appears to have chosen the surgeons of the first fleet (1787), who achieved a remarkable health record and provided the medical establishment of the colony. He also collaborated with Sir Gilbert Blane in his book <span class="italic">Diseases of Seamen</span> (1785) and Blane was impressed by his warm and disinterested zeal for the service.<br>
<br>Initially, Ramsay bore the acrimony of the planters alone until Wilberforce, whom he had met in 1783, and T. Clarkson, his curate in 1787, rallied to the abolitionist cause. He was thereafter consulted by Pitt as the Middletons co-ordinated the anti-slavery campaign. In the run-up to the first Commons debate on abolition (May 1789)&#151;a response to the deluge of petitions following the controversy over Ramsay's books&#151;Ramsay prepared briefs for Wilberforce and other politicians containing many of the moral arguments and much of the evidence which Wilberforce used in his speech. During the debate Crisp Molyneux, a planter from St Kitts, impugned Ramsay's character and professional reputation. Although Middleton leapt to his defence and Olaudah Equiano, an emancipated slave acquainted with St Kitts, confirmed all that Ramsay had written, Ramsay never recovered from this attack. He developed increasingly severe abdominal pain and died from a massive gastric haemorrhage on 20 July 1789 in the Middletons' London home in Hertford Street. He was buried in Teston churchyard on 25 July and a memorial near to that of his black servant Nestor is in Teston church. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>C. I. La Trobe paid tribute to Ramsay's diligence, benevolence, and urbanity and to his mild and charitable disposition  (La Trobe, 17), while Clarkson admired his insight, coolness, courage, patriotism, public spirit, amiability, and the personal example which characterized his ministry  (Clarkson, 2.117). Even his enemies acknowledged his exemplary qualities, while deploring the intemperate language of his books; and the abolition of the British slave trade in 1807 probably owed more to James Ramsay's personal integrity, ethical arguments, and constructive proposals than to any other influence.<br>
