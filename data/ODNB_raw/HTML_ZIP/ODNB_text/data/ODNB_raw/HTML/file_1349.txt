<span class="headword">Barclay,  Robert</span>  (1833&#150;1876), <span class="occ">Quaker and ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born on 4 August 1833 at Croydon. He was the younger son of John Barclay (1797&#150;1838), a descendant of the Quaker apologist Robert Barclay, and himself an expert on the early literature of the Society of Friends. After attending a preparatory school at Epping, he went to the Friends' school at Hitchin, run by Isaac Brown. His education was finished at Bruce Grove House, Tottenham. He attained a good knowledge of botany and chemistry, was fond of electrical experiments, and had skill as a watercolour artist. He married on 14 July 1857 Sarah Matilda, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10209/', "Francis Fry")</script> of Bristol, the bibliographer of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span>. They had nine children.<br>
<br>Trained for business at Bristol, Barclay bought, in 1855, a London manufacturing stationery concern (in Bucklersbury, afterwards in College Street and Maiden Lane), taking into partnership his brother-in-law, J. D. Fry, in 1867. In March 1860 he patented an &#145;indelible writing paper&#146; for the prevention of forgery, the process of manufacturing which he described in a communication to the Society of Arts.<br>
<br>Both at home and abroad Barclay was interested in efforts for the evangelization of the masses; though not recorded as a minister of the Society of Friends, he preached in their meetings and missions. Thirty-six of his sermons, which were written, an uncommon thing with Friends, were published by his widow in 1878. In 1868 he delivered a lecture on the position of the Society of Friends in relation to the spread of the gospel during the previous sixty years, and was anxious to see the body regaining its position as an evangelical church. He was strongly in favour of the public reading of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Friends' meetings, and thought Richard Claridge's <span class="italic">Treatise of the Holy Scriptures</span> (1724) presented a more accurate view of the sentiments of the early Friends than their controversial writings. He was strongly opposed to the practice of birthright membership, introduced among Friends in 1737; his work <span class="italic">On Membership in the Society of Friends</span> (1873) was one of the most important contributions to the debate. His opinions on these points led to his undertaking the important series of investigations which culminated in <span class="italic">The Inner Life of the Religious Societies of the Commonwealth</span> (1876), in which he examined the internal constitution of the obscurer Commonwealth sects, the ramifications of which he traced with a diligence which caused his book to be highly regarded by contemporaries. His presentation of the doctrinal aspects of primitive Quakerism was ably criticized from the standpoint of a quietist Friend in an <span class="italic">Examen</span> (1878) by Charles Evans of Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Barclay's health was undermined by his work, and before the last proof-sheets of his book had been finished the rupture of a blood-vessel in the brain caused his death on 11 November 1876 at his home, Hillside, Reigate, Surrey. He was buried in the Winchmore Hill burial-ground in Middlesex. In addition to editing his sermons, his widow published <span class="italic">The Self-Revealing Jehovah of the Old Testament the Christ of the New Testament</span> (1885).<br>
