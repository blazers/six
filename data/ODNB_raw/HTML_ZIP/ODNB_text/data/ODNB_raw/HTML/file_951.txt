<span class="headword">Ayscough,  Francis</span>  (1701&#150;1763), <span class="occ">courtier and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Surrey on 19 December 1701 and baptized on 25 December in St Olave's, Southwark, the second son of Gabriel Ayscough (<i>bap</i>. 1668) and his wife, Mary. He was educated at Abingdon School, Berkshire, and matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 28 March 1717, where he graduated BA on 12 December 1720 and proceeded MA on 24 March 1723. He was ordained deacon on 18 December 1726, elected a probationer fellow of Corpus Christi on 16 January 1727, and ordained priest on 16 June 1728. In January 1730 the fellows of Corpus Christi voted eight to four against appointing him to a full fellowship but he appealed successfully to the visitor, who awarded him reinstatement, his costs and arrears to be paid by the fellows personally. He proceeded BD on 22 February 1731 and DD in 1735.<br>
<br>While at Oxford, Ayscough acquired a reputation as &#145;a person well supported by zealous friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Proceedings of Corpus Christi College</span>, 38); certainly he was socially adept and moved easily in aristocratic circles. One of his Oxford pupils, between 1726 and 1728, was George Lyttelton, later first Baron Lyttelton, who considered him to be &#145;a gentleman of great learning, candour, and judgement&#146;  (Phillimore, 2.346). In 1730 Ayscough unsuccessfully proposed marriage to Ann Pitt, sister of Lyttelton's friend William Pitt. In 1732 he was introduced to Frederick, prince of Wales, and at some time after that he was brought by Lyttelton into Frederick's circle. Meanwhile, Ayscough identified himself as a latitudinarian churchman by defending Benjamin Hoadly's views on the eucharist in <span class="italic">A Proper Answer to a Late Abusive Pamphlet Entitled &#145;The Winchester Converts&#146;</span> (1735). In 1736, preaching before the House of Commons on the anniversary of the martyrdom of Charles I, he opposed &#145;enthusiasm&#146; while defending liberty of speculation: &#145;are not men to think at all because mad men will think madley, and weak men will think weakly?&#146;  (Ayscough, <span class="italic">A Sermon</span>, 21). In August 1736 he was appointed chaplain and clerk of the closet to Frederick, in which role he assumed control of a substantial part of the prince's political patronage. Ayscough was active in election business, especially in the west country, throughout the later 1730s and 1740s. In 1741 he was nominated by Frederick to the living of Northchurch, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Ayscough was almost certainly the author of a political diary detailing the involvement of Frederick and his allies in the reconstruction of the government between January 1742 and November 1743, which is preserved in the Holland House manuscripts at the British Library. The diary, written by someone intimately involved with the prince's finances and his election patronage, is a useful source for the period immediately preceding and following the resignation of Sir Robert Walpole and for the political conduct of Frederick at this time. Ayscough acted as intermediary between Frederick and the Wilmington ministry on the one hand and his patron, Lyttelton, and Pitt on the other, during negotiations in late 1742 and early 1743 aimed at bringing Pitt and Lyttelton into the ministry. The paths of Ayscough and Lyttelton began to diverge at about this time. In 1744 Ayscough was appointed preceptor to Frederick's two eldest sons, George and Edward. On 21 January 1745 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, he fulfilled a longstanding arrangement and married Lyttelton's sister Anne (1714&#150;1776), who brought with her an income of &pound;6000 a year. However, his relations with Lyttelton were badly damaged by his management of the election at Okehampton in 1747, when on Frederick's behalf he unsuccessfully attempted to unseat Lyttelton, who had joined the Pelham administration, which Frederick opposed.<br>
<br>Ayscough remained close to the Pitt family and was particularly concerned in Frederick's lease of the borough of Old Sarum from Thomas Pitt, Ayscough's wife's brother-in-law, who by 1749 was deeply in debt. In June of that year Ayscough arranged that Frederick would pay Thomas Pitt &pound;3000 per annum in return for the nomination &#145;of every M.P. that shall be at the borough of Old Sarum &hellip; without any further expense&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 59484, fol. 67). Other clerks to the royal closet had gone on to high preferments in the church, and Ayscough must have hoped for a bishopric on Frederick's accession to the throne. His portrait, painted in 1749 by Richard Wilson, in which he is seen presiding over the two young princes, suggests an ambitious as well as a masterful and evidently capable cleric. His hopes were dashed, however, by the death of the prince of Wales on 30 March 1751, which was immediately followed by Ayscough's replacement as tutor to the princes. Horace Walpole suggests that just before this event Ayscough had been instrumental in bringing about a renewed political understanding between the Lyttelton interest and Frederick's court at Leicester House. Walpole described Ayscough as &#145;an insolent man, unwelcome to the clergy on suspicions of heterodoxy, and of no fair reputation for integrity&#146;  (Walpole, 1.56) and suggested that under his care Prince George had failed to learn to write English&#151;a slur that is contradicted by surviving letters from Prince George to his father. Politically inconvenient to the former allies of Prince Frederick, and too latitudinarian for most of the clergy, Ayscough did not receive further appointment until the veteran controversialist whom he had once defended, Benjamin Hoadly, appointed him a canon at Winchester in 1756. He had to wait for significant ecclesiastical promotion until the accession of one of his former pupils as King George III, after which he was given the deanery of Bristol in 1761.<br>
<br>Ayscough died in Bristol on 16 August 1763, and was buried in Bristol Cathedral on 19 August. He left &pound;10,000 to his wife, who died in 1776. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/952/', "George Edward Ayscough")</script>, who died in 1779, after a life of debauchery.<br>
