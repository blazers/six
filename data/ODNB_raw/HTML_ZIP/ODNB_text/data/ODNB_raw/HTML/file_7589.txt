</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dibdin,  Thomas John</span>  (1771&#150;1841), <span class="occ">playwright and actor</span>, was born at 5 Peter Street (now Museum Street), Bloomsbury, London, on 21 March 1771, the second of the two illegitimate sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7585/', "Charles Dibdin (bap. 1745, d. 1814)")</script> and the actress and dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22329/', "Harriet Pitt (1748?&#150;1814)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22326/', "Pitt, Ann")</script>]. He was brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7586/', "Charles Isaac Mungo Dibdin (1768&#150;1833)")</script> and the dancer Harriet Pitt (<i>b</i>. 1770), and half-brother to the musician George Cecil Pitt (<i>bap</i>. 1767, <i>d</i>. 1820).<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandthestage"></a>Early life and the stage</h2>As the godson of David Garrick, who befriended the family after Charles abandoned his responsibilities, the four-year-old Dibdin walked on as Cupid in Garrick's revival of his Shakespearian pageant <span class="italic">The Jubilee</span> (Drury Lane, 1775&#150;6). Mrs Siddons, playing Venus, assisted in securing one of his wings. Dibdin's mother, as Mrs Davenett, resumed acting at Drury Lane in 1788 for two seasons (and afterwards transferred to Covent Garden) to finance his education at St Paul's Cathedral choir school under Robert Hudson, followed by a year-long interlude boarding at an unexacting establishment in Half-Farthing Lane, Wandsworth, then a rigorous three-year classical training at Barnard's Castle, co. Durham. To keep her son off the stage, Harriet entrusted him at the age of fourteen to his well-to-do great-uncle Cecil Pitt, a retired Dalston upholsterer, who apprenticed him in business to William Rawlins.<br>
<br>Dibdin, however, shared his family's infatuation with the theatre, which stretched back to his maternal grandmother, the Covent Garden actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22326/', "Ann Pitt (c.1720&#150;1799)")</script>. At school in co. Durham he had witnessed plays at a local inn, and in young adulthood he benefited from free access by family order to the three patent theatres in London. Through his friendship with John Palmer the Royalty (opened in 1787) became a regular escape hole. When Rawlins discovered and violently destroyed his apprentice's model theatre, Dibdin sought arbitration from John Wilkes, the city chamberlain. Rawlins was admonished and Dibdin agreed to eschew theatricals; but the lure of the stage was irresistible, and two months later he was almost discovered as, unrecognized, he sat adjacent to his master in the Royalty's gallery.<h2>
<a name="Atravellingactor"></a>A travelling actor</h2>Determined to abandon his apprenticeship, in July 1789, armed with an introduction from Cockran Booth, the prompter at Covent Garden and part owner of the Margate theatre (where his half-brother Cecil was employed), Dibdin absconded by riverboat. The Margate company being full, he was found a niche in the Dover troupe, managed by Richland, playing at Eastbourne, where, in late summer, under the stage name of T. Merchant to avoid detection, he appeared as Captain Valentine in John O'Keeffe's farce <span class="italic">The Farmer</span> and sang &#145;Poor Jack&#146;, a well-known song of his father's. To supplement his income in this profit-sharing company, he painted scenery (including a smokily realistic armada for <span class="italic">The Critic</span>) and wrote the first of about 2000 songs. Three months afterwards he joined Mrs Baker's extensive Kent circuit at Deal, a salaried engagement which Dibdin reckoned as &#145;the next grade to a situation in a theatre royal, the grand aim of my ambition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.92). At Easter 1790 he transferred to Butler's company and visited Beverley and Harrogate, once performing alongside Mrs Jordan.<br>
<br>In 1791, at the jointly managed Liverpool and Manchester theatres, Dibdin achieved his goal of a theatre-royal appointment. With only hours' notice, he played Mungo&#151;&#145;that most favourite of all my father's favourite characters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.111)&#151;in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Padlock</span> when the Manchester theatre reopened after a fire. Over three years he established himself as a scene-painter and gained valuable experience in stage-management; he also performed a season at Chester. In summer 1792 he played as far north as Banff and Inverness. After his return to Manchester as &#145;prompter and <i>fac-totum</i>&#146;  (ibid., 1.165), his first play, the farce <span class="italic">Sunshine after Rain</span>, was staged (15 March 1793); it was published pseudonymously in 1795 as <span class="italic">The Mad Guardian</span> (with &#145;Fugitive Pieces&#146; of prose and verse). At Manchester collegiate church, as Thomas Pitt, he married, on 23 May 1793, the actress Ann Hilliar (1774?&#150;1828) (familiarly known as Nancy), whom he had met three years before at Beverley.<br>
<br>Following joint engagements at Rochdale and Huddersfield, Dibdin and his now pregnant wife journeyed in deep winter 1793&#150;4 to south-west Wales, where, for Henry Masterman's lively company at Haverfordwest and Carmarthen, Dibdin wrote and performed a new song weekly. Early in 1794 their first child, Maria, was born; and <span class="italic">Comic Songs</span> (1794), probably Dibdin's first publication, appeared under his Merchant pseudonym. On reading in the newspaper of the staging of <span class="italic">Rival Loyalties</span>, his recently completed burletta, at Sadler's Wells in May 1794, Dibdin, aspiring to a metropolitan career as a playwright, hurriedly set off for London. Masterman generously kept open his engagement, but Dibdin never returned. His affection for Carmarthen and Haverfordwest audiences, however, inspired the dedication of <span class="italic">St David's Day</span> (1800) &#145;to the memory of their liberality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.183).<br>
<br>The Dibdins were engaged at Sadler's Wells from 1794&#150;5, Thomas to act and write burlettas at 5 guineas a week and Ann as a performer. Now safe in his increasing reputation, Dibdin dropped his disguise and for the first time assumed his father's surname, though against the latter's wishes. In 1796 the Dibdins accepted a good offer from Mrs Baker, giving each of them two clear benefits in each town, to return to the Kent circuit. But Dibdin continued to write occasionally for Sadler's Wells, including <span class="italic">The British Raft</span> (1797), which featured the hugely successful anti-French song &#145;The Snug Little Island&#146; (bought by Longman for 15 guineas, three times what the theatre paid for the entire burletta). Dibdin's opportunity to break into legitimate theatre arrived in July 1798, when his farce <span class="italic">The Jew and the Doctor</span> gained such acclaim at Maidstone that it was purchased for performance at Covent Garden. From 19 October 1798 Dibdin appeared on Covent Garden's salary list at &pound;5 weekly, and steadily moved away from acting to concentrate on authorship. (Ann joined on 18 September 1799, at &pound;3, appearing as Aura in <span class="italic">The Farm House</span>.) In his first season, beginning with <span class="italic">The Mouth of the Nile</span> (acted twenty-seven times), in celebration of Nelson's naval victory, Dibdin made &pound;466 6<i>s</i>., sufficient to increase his financial support to his mother and grandmother. At the same time his indentures were cancelled when Rawlins, in a spirit of reconciliation, accepted reduced compensation of 50 guineas.<h2>
<a name="Londonplaywright"></a>London playwright</h2>Dibdin's association with Covent Garden lasted eleven years. A special responsibility was the annual pantomime, regularly occupying six or eight months each year, produced in collaboration with Charles Farley. His outstanding success was <span class="italic">Harlequin and Mother Goose</span> (1806)&#151;said to have grossed &pound;3000 for Covent Garden in the first three weeks&#151;which reorientated the genre by giving dominance to the clown, played, on Dibdin's personal recommendation, by Jo Grimaldi. In several areas Dibdin was a reliable Covent Garden writer; but there were as many pains as rewards to endure as house author, experiences which later emerged in <span class="italic">Harlequin Hoax, or, A Pantomime Proposed</span> (1814). In the aptly titled <span class="italic">Family Quarrels</span> (1802), Dibdin despaired of ever satisfying the vocal requirements of the squabbling principals, and during the performance local Jews' offence at the song &#145;I Courted Miss Levi&#146; caused uproar over several nights. With <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span> (1802)&#151;&#145;a very productive stock opera&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.309), though plagued, if less severely, by disputes of precedence among performers and staged in nineteen days from conception&#151;Dibdin cleared &pound;700. His most successful season, concluding at the Haymarket with the five-act comedy <span class="italic">Guilty or Not Guilty</span> (1804), one of several pieces written over the years for George Colman junior, produced a total income of &pound;1515. At the commencement of the 1805&#150;6 season Dibdin negotiated his first salary increase of a pound a week for Ann and himself.<br>
<br>In parallel with his writing and managing career, Dibdin in 1802 joined his brother Charles in acquiring for &pound;1400 a quarter-share in Sadler's Wells, which by 1805 was making good returns. But theatrical speculation was always uncertain, and their involvement in the Dublin theatre about the same time lost the two brothers nearly &pound;2000.<h2>
<a name="Attemptsatmanagement"></a>Attempts at management</h2>On Thomas Harris's retirement in 1809, Dibdin left Covent Garden&#151;Ann having departed a year earlier&#151;and bought a cottage at Betchworth, in bosky Surrey, intending to write free from London's temptations. Though he kept the cottage until the 1820s, his notion of semi-retirement yielded in October 1810 to R. W. Elliston's seductive offer of &pound;15 a week as author and manager at the Surrey, where he stayed for two seasons. In October 1812, after deliberating over the seeming drop in professional status, he went to Drury Lane as prompter at &pound;520 per annum, for which he was to write a pantomime and one topical piece on any public or national event. This was not a happy time, since relations with the second proprietor Samuel Whitbread, whose authoritarian style Dibdin abhorred, were often frosty. After Whitbread's death in July 1815 Dibdin was re-engaged at Drury Lane, as joint acting manager with Alexander Rae, an unequal partnership in which Dibdin did most of the work. Although the new management subcommittee as individuals, including Lord Byron, were generally supportive, Dibdin alleged that &#145;collectively they did not treat me well&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 2.57). His assumption in 1816 of the lease of the Surrey Theatre (then with no intention of managing it personally)&#151;initially not resisted&#151;caused his dismissal on grounds of conflict of interest, though Drury Lane continued his salary until the following October.<br>
<br>Dibdin's management of the Surrey began ambitiously but ended in financial ruin. By the opening night on 1 July, when his wife (resuming her theatrical career) spoke a comic address prefacing a programme comprising the melodrama <span class="italic">Housewarming</span> and a historical romance, <span class="italic">Chevy Chase</span>&#151;both &#145;written on the spur of the moment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 2.132)&#151;Dibdin had spent &pound;4000 in six weeks on interior refurbishment. Although the productions were highly regarded and Dibdin attracted, at various times, first-rate performers, receipts declined long before the first season was out. Serious competition came not just from Astley's but, unanticipated, from a new rival, the Coburg. Even with a solid repertory of 180 stock pieces and opportunities to change programmes nightly, in six years' management (ending prematurely on 19 March 1822) only two seasons were financially viable: 1817&#150;18 and 1818&#150;19, saved, respectively, by the burlesque <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> (performed over 100 nights and imitated many times in London and elsewhere) and <span class="italic">The Lily of St Leonard's, or, The Heart of Midlothian</span> (the first of many adaptations of Scott, the copyright of which, exceptionally as a minor theatre piece, realized 60 guineas). Dibdin's debts amounted to a catastrophic &pound;18,000 and he was made bankrupt. His discharge took place on 21 May 1822.<h2>
<a name="Financialdifficultiesanddecliningstatus"></a>Financial difficulties and declining status</h2>At this juncture Dibdin accepted a three-year summer contract as stage-manager at Morris's Haymarket, at &pound;200 with one benefit, while Ann superintended the women's wardrobe for &#145;a very trifling salary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 2.215). In October he became stage-manager of Drury Lane, again under Elliston, in whose employ as acting manager was the volatile James Winston. Dibdin clashed with both. Against Elliston, who sought ways to remove him, he resorted in February 1824 to a court order to enforce his contract. Even more unhappy was his experience at the Haymarket, where (in contrast to relations with its former proprietor, Colman) Dibdin complained bitterly of &#145;daily and nightly degradations&#146; endured in Morris's service  (ibid., 2.294). Continuing financial difficulties forced him to borrow money from extortioners in the winter of 1823&#150;4 and, after <span class="italic">Come if you can</span> (June 1824) failed, Morris refused him his salary. In July he was arrested for debt and languished until Michaelmas in the king's bench prison. For payment on <span class="italic">The Laplanders</span>, written&#151;bizarrely&#151;at Morris's request for a piece for a herd of reindeer (which, in the event, died before the performance could take place), Dibdin was again forced into litigation (23 June 1826). Through debt he also lost his library. Such experiences confirmed him in the view that he had led &#145;a very chequered, and not a very fortunate life&#146;  (ibid., 2.405).<br>
<br>Having secured the stage-managership of Sadler's Wells, beginning on 4 April 1825 at &pound;400 per annum, Dibdin moved to the spaciousness of Myddelton Square in the nearby New Town and hoped to start afresh. His contract was renewed at intervals and he continued to write burlettas for Sadler's Wells until mid-1828, shortly before Ann Dibdin's premature death on 29 August. He married Catherine Court at St Pancras on 9 April 1829 and at the age of fifty-eight began a new family.<br>
<br>Overall, however, socially and professionally, the 1830s were even more uncomfortable than the 1820s. Encouraged by Bulwer-Lytton's copyright reform, Dibdin published, under royal patronage and wide theatrical subscription, a collection of 200 songs, the valedictory title of which&#151;<span class="italic">Last Lays of the Last of the Three Dibdins</span> (1833)&#151;reinforces the sense of his being at the end of a theatrical line. During the reform excitement his new satirical periodical&#151;<span class="italic">Tom Dibdin's Penny Trumpet</span> (October&#150;November 1832)&#151;foundered after four numbers. While he wrote occasional minor theatre pieces&#151;the last in 1837&#151;his income was extremely small and monetary troubles multiplied. Increasingly desperate applications to the Literary Fund produced grants totalling &pound;175 between 1824 and 1838. In 1834&#150;5 he spent nearly a year, reportedly in a condition of near starvation, in Horsemonger Lane debtors' prison; and in 1838 he wrote despairingly to the fund's managers that &#145;the situation of my Family and self becomes daily more critically painful&#146;  (12 November).<br>
<br>Ironically, Dibdin's last commission, under the patronage of Lord Minto (representing the Admiralty), was to edit the <span class="italic">Songs, Naval and National of the Late Charles Dibdin</span> (1841), the father who had neglected his hero-worshipping son all his life. While preparing the edition Dibdin received a small weekly stipend in acknowledgement of his financial plight. He died from asthma on 16 September 1841 at his home, 22 Trevor Square, Knightsbridge, and was buried on 21 September at St James's, Pentonville, near his mother and grandmother.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Open, forthright, but companionable in nature, Dibdin cultivated a wide circle of friends, including George Colman junior, Charles Farley, Benjamin Thompson, Douglas Jerrold, Sam Russell, and Thomas Harris (almost a surrogate father). He was &#145;poet laureate&#146; of the Covent Garden Beefsteak Club. However, most of his closest friends (and his brother) predeceased him and, in the last decade of his life, with the responsibilities of a young family, the shocking consequences of his indigence deprived him of much of his spirit.<br>
<br>Outside the drama, several early essays and tales of Dibdin's appeared in the <span class="italic">New Lady's Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's and Lady's Pocket Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">The Biographic</span>. He edited briefly the <span class="italic">Monthly Epitome</span> in 1798; and his <span class="italic">Metrical History</span>, an eccentric aide-m&eacute;moire for schoolchildren of historical events, appeared in 1813. As was the case with many of the period's playwrights, Dibdin's dramatic output was prodigious&#151;about 250 pieces, excluding songs, prologues, and epilogues (which he had a reputation for turning out at the drop of a hat). He wrote at great speed (though never, he claimed, on Sundays), capturing precisely audience tastes. A facility for word play and puns contributed to his substantial success as a pantomimist. His Scott adaptations&#151;for which he established a vogue&#151;were sometimes as spectacular as his pantomimes. About a quarter of his total output was published. Several plays, including popular stock pieces such as <span class="italic">The Birthday</span> (1799) and <span class="italic">Of Age Tomorrow</span> (1805), along with <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span> (1821), were still available in Dicks's series at the end of the century. For Whittingham and Arliss, he compiled <span class="italic">Dibdin's London Theatre</span> (26 vols., 1815&#150;18), based on prompt books of the theatres royal with original cast lists derived from materials in John Kemble's library. But perhaps his best achievement is his autobiography (2 vols., 1827), a lively and informative theatrical narrative, which, because it ran none of the risks, was &#145;preferable to writing a play&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.7).<br>
<br>Of the numerous children of Dibdin's first marriage, only two survived into adulthood: Thomas Robert Colman Dibdin (1810&#150;1893), a Post Office clerk, who exhibited landscapes at the Royal Academy (1832&#150;74), and Charles Alexander Dibdin (<i>b</i>. 1815). His second marriage produced three more children, the eldest of whom was barely eleven at his death, immediately before and after which the family was forced to seek renewed assistance from the Literary Fund.<br>
