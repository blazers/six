<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vere,  Edward  de</span>, seventeenth earl of Oxford  (1550&#150;1604), <span class="occ">courtier and poet</span>, was born on 12 April 1550, probably at Castle Hedingham, Essex, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28216/', "John de Vere, sixteenth earl of Oxford (1516&#150;1562)")</script>, and his second wife, Margery, daughter of Sir John Golding and half-sister of Arthur Golding, the translator of Ovid. Until his father's death he was known as Lord Bulbeck.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyyears"></a>Education and early years</h2>Bulbeck matriculated as an impubes (immature) fellow-commoner of Queens' College, Cambridge, in November 1558, remaining for one academic year. He seems thereafter to have been tutored in the household of Sir Thomas Smith by Thomas Fowle. Upon his father's death on 3 August 1562 he succeeded to the earldom of Oxford and other hereditary dignities, including the ceremonial office of lord great chamberlain. His half-sister Katherine, daughter of his father's first wife, Dorothy, second daughter of Ralph Neville, fourth earl of Westmorland, challenged his legitimacy, claiming irregularities in their father's marriage to Margery Golding; Oxford was successfully defended by Arthur Golding, then his receiver. As a royal ward he came under the guardianship of William Cecil, master of the court of wards. Cecil drew up orders for his exercises and for his studies, which were put in the hands of Lawrence Nowell, dean of Lichfield: he learned French, Latin, penmanship, and dancing. An early taste for literature is evidenced in his purchases of books by Chaucer, Plutarch (in French), Cicero, and Plato (probably in Latin).<br>
<br>Oxford accompanied the queen on progress to Cambridge in August 1564, and to Oxford in September 1566. Like others in the queen's retinue he was granted an unearned MA on each occasion. In July 1567, while practising the art of fencing with a Westminster tailor in the garden of Cecil House, he killed an unarmed and possibly inebriated undercook, Thomas Brincknell of Westminster. A coroner's jury which was openly influenced by Cecil, and which included Ralph Holinshed, spared Oxford, with the grotesque finding that Brincknell had committed suicide by &#145;running upon a point of a fence-sword of the said earl&#146;  (Murdin, 2.764). Oxford thus learned that he could commit no outrage which Cecil would not forgive and do his best to forget. On 24 October 1569, in the first of some eighty surviving letters and memoranda in English, and in his own hand, he begged Cecil to procure him some military duty. Though he desired a posting to the continent, he was sent to Scotland under the command of Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, in or about April 1570. Upon coming of age on 12 April 1571 he took his seat in the House of Lords; in May he engaged in the tilt, tourney, and barrier in the queen's presence at Westminster. In August he was appointed to attend the French envoy, Paul de Foix, who travelled to England to discuss the queen's projected marriage to the duc d'Anjou. About the same time he declared an interest in Cecil's eldest daughter, Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46899/', "Vere, Anne de, countess of Oxford")</script>], then fourteen, and received the queen's consent to a marriage. Cecil&#151;now Lord Burghley&#151;explained to the earl of Rutland, evidently a disappointed rival, that he &#145;found in the earl more understanding than any stranger to him would think&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.95). The wedding, celebrated on 19 December 1571, was attended by the queen.<br>
<br>The marriage was a disaster. By March 1572 Oxford remonstrated with Burghley over the prosecution of Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, and was suspected of arranging an abortive plot to rescue Norfolk from the Tower. On 22 September he entreated Burghley to procure him naval employment, but had to settle for life at court, where he openly flirted with the queen. &#145;My Lord of Oxford&#146;, wrote Gilbert Talbot to his father, the earl of Shrewsbury, on 11 May 1573:<blockquote>is lately grown into great credit; for the queen's Majesty delighteth more in his personage, and his dancing and valiantness, than any other. I think Sussex doth back him all that he can; if it were not for his fickle head, he would pass any of them shortly. (Lodge, 2.100&#150;01)</blockquote>Talbot knew his man. Early in July 1574 Oxford departed without licence for Flanders, the refuge of northern English Catholic nobility. Enraged, the queen dispatched gentlemen pensioners, led by Thomas Bedingfield, to fetch him back. Having dutifully returned by the end of the month, in August Oxford and Burghley waited on the queen at Bristol with an apology. Conciliatory, she agreed to allow Oxford to travel abroad with licence. He left early in February 1575 and visited Paris and Strasbourg before making his way to Venice by April. Over the next year he visited Padua, Siena, and Milan, among other cities, finally decamping from Venice on 6 March 1576. He carried with him to Paris and Calais luxurious articles of dress and toilet, a Venetian choirboy named Orazio Cogno, and memories of a Venetian courtesan named Virginia Padoana. Waylaid by pirates on crossing the channel, Oxford was bereft of many of his souvenirs, finally landing at Dover on 20 April and returning to London by river-wherry to avoid meeting Anne&#151;who in the interim had borne a daughter, Elizabeth&#151;at Gravesend. The distraught Burghley declared that Oxford had been &#145;enticed by certain lewd persons to be a stranger to his wife&#146;  (Murdin, 2.778), apparently unable to conceive that his son-in-law preferred the company of the choirboy, whom he kept in his London lodgings for eleven months, giving rise to suspicions of pederasty. Oxford made himself fashionable by sporting imported embroidered gloves, sweet-bags, perfumed leather jerkins, and costly washes or perfumes, and ingratiated himself with the queen by presenting her with perfumed gloves trimmed with tufts or roses of coloured silk.<h2>
<a name="Courtier"></a>Courtier</h2>Oxford's eccentricities and irregularities of temper grew with his years. From 1577 to December 1580 he and his intimate friends Henry Howard and Charles Arundel flirted with Catholicism and sedition, amusing themselves at Oxford's table, while Oxford derided the queen, particularly her singing voice. Oxford nevertheless accompanied Elizabeth to Saffron Walden and Audley End in July 1578. Gabriel Harvey paid the earl conventional compliments in one of three dedications prefaced to the third book of his memorial volume, <span class="italic">Gratulationes Valdenses</span>. About the same time Harvey composed a satire of Oxford as an Italianated Englishman under the title &#145;Speculum Tuscanismi&#146;, describing him as clad in &#145;a little apish hatte, cowched fast to the pate, like an oyster&#146;, and in French cambric ruffs; as &#145;delicate in speach, queynte in araye: conceited in all poyntes &hellip; a passing singular odde man&#146;  (Spenser, sig. E2). Nash's charge that the earl caused his libeller to be imprisoned in the Fleet prison is not independently verifiable, and was denied by Harvey. In August 1579 Oxford insulted Sir Philip Sidney in the tennis court at Greenwich, calling him a &#145;puppy&#146;. Sources differ on who initiated the ensuing written challenge, but the queen interposed on the earl's behalf, forbidding a duel and ordering Sidney to defer to Oxford's superior rank. Unwilling to bear the humiliation, Sidney retired from court. Oxford is reported to have plotted Sidney's murder.<br>
<br>On 16 December 1580 Oxford denounced Howard and Arundel to the queen as Catholic sympathizers. Hoist with his own petard, Oxford spent a few days in the Tower himself, but soon regained his freedom and won the prize in a tilt on 22 January 1581. On 23 March, however, the Yorkshire beauty and queen's maid of honour <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68083/', "Anne Vavasour")</script>, who had been Oxford's mistress since 1579, gave birth to a son, whereupon he found himself back in the Tower. He recovered his freedom in June, and in December was reconciled with his wife.<br>
<br>Domestic tranquillity was shattered again in March 1582, when Oxford fought a duel with Anne Vavasour's uncle Sir Thomas Knyvet. Both men were wounded, the earl more dangerously. Their quarrel continued on and off for a year, with deaths and injuries among retainers on both sides. In May 1583, at Ralegh's instigation, the queen and Oxford achieved a <i>modus vivendi</i>. In August 1585 he sailed with John Norris to the Netherlands; a letter from Burghley informing Oxford that he was to have command of the horse failed to reach him before his sudden return to England on 21 October in a fit of &#145;humour&#146;. Still in the queen's graces, but impoverished, he petitioned her for a &pound;1000 annuity, which she granted in 1586. In October of that year he became commissioner for the trial of Mary, queen of Scots, taking part in the proceedings at Fotheringhay and in the Star Chamber at Westminster. In 1588, during the Armada battle, Oxford volunteered for service at Tilbury but refused Leicester's request that he serve as governor of Harwich, thinking the position beneath him. When Oxford took his complaint to the queen, Leicester wrote to Walsingham: &#145;I am glad I am rid of my Lord Oxford, seeing he refuseth this and I pray you let me not be pressed any more for him what suit so ever he make&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/214(1), fols. 2&#150;3). To cover the earl's dereliction of duty Burghley, in a propaganda pamphlet issued the same year, refashioned Oxford, along with other non-combatant noblemen, into national heroes.<br>
<br>Since 1569 Oxford had received votes for the Order of the Garter approximately proportional to the esteem in which he was held by the queen. After 1588 he received no more votes while she lived. He nevertheless performed the duties of a peer in the trials of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, in 1589, and Essex in 1601. After Anne died of a fever in 1588, Oxford married again about January 1592. His second wife was Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Thomas Trentham of Rocester Priory, Staffordshire; she secured the lineage by giving birth to a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28210/', "Henry de Vere (1593&#150;1625)")</script>, the future eighteenth earl. Moving from London, first to Stoke Newington and thence to Hackney, Oxford devoted his declining years to the endless pursuit of supplementary income, petitioning for the monopoly on fruit, oils, and wool; for the gauging of beer; for the pre-emption of tin in Cornwall and Devon (1595&#150;9); for the governorship of Jersey; and for the presidency of Wales. His numerous letters to Burghley and to Robert Cecil reflect his endless disappointments. Bitter to the end, he plotted against the royal succession by a Scot. His signature is notably absent from the proclamation of 24 March 1603 and its first printed impression, though it was added to the second impression. At James I's coronation on 25 July Oxford secured fees due to the office of lord great chamberlain; his annuity was subsequently extended. Perhaps succumbing to the consequences of the high-risk behaviour of his youth, and following a decade of complaints about his health, he died on 24 June 1604 and was buried on 6 July in the churchyard of St Augustine, Hackney, without a memorial tomb.<br>
<br>Oxford was notorious in his own time for his effeminate dress, for his irregular life, and for squandering virtually his entire patrimony on personal extravagance. Exemplary was his purchase in 1580 of Fisher's Folly, so named because it had bankrupted its original builder, the London alderman Jasper Fisher. Unable to sustain the expense of maintaining the house, Oxford was forced to sell in 1588. Eternally short of funds, he did not scruple to burden lesser men with his debts. About 1591 the poet Thomas Churchyard hired lodgings for the earl at the house of Mrs Julian Penn, giving his own bond in lieu of cash. When Oxford neglected to pay the rent, Churchyard, in fear of arrest, sought sanctuary.<br>
<br>Oxford's first wife, Anne, died at the queen's palace at Greenwich on 5 June 1588, and was buried in state at Westminster Abbey on 25 June. Numerous elegies are preserved in the British Library (Lansdowne MS 104, fols. 195&#150;214; Cotton MS Julius F. 10, fols. 112&#150;115<i>v</i>, 132). Though she was well educated and is even said by Sturmius to have spoken Latin, the four epitaphs written after her son died at birth in May 1583, and attributed to Anne by John Southern in his <span class="italic">Pandora</span> of 1584, were in fact translations (doubtless by Southern himself) from the French poetry of Desportes. Anne's other children were: Elizabeth, born 2 July 1575, who married William Stanley, earl of Derby, at Greenwich on 26 January 1594 and died at Richmond on 10 March 1627; Bridget, born 6 April 1584, who married Francis, Lord Norris (afterwards earl of Berkshire) in May or June 1599; Frances, who died and was buried at Edmonton on 12 September 1587; and Susan, born 26 May 1587, who married Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery, and died in 1628 or 1629. Oxford's second wife, Elizabeth, was buried at Hackney on 3 January 1613. The illegitimate son of the earl and Anne Vavasour, Edward Vere, distinguished himself as a soldier and died on 18 August 1629.<h2>
<a name="Poetryandbookdedications"></a>Poetry and book dedications</h2>Oxford evinced a genuine interest in music, and wrote verse of much lyric beauty. Puttenham, and Meres in Puttenham's footsteps, reckoned him among &#145;the best for comedy&#146; in his day but, although Oxford was a patron of a company of players from 1580 to 1602, no specimen of his dramatic compositions survives. Sixteen lyrical poems have been authenticated as his work, along with four more doubtful pieces. Most of his poems first appeared in poetical anthologies signed E. O., or E. of O. Amateurish verses &#145;To the reader&#146;, marred by heavy alliteration, together with a pompous letter from the earl to the translator, were prefixed to Bedingfield's translation of Cardanus's <span class="italic">Comfort</span> (1576), &#145;published by commandment of the right honourable the Earl of Oxenford&#146;. These verses and an accompanying letter were composed about 1 January 1572, when Oxford was twenty-one. Seven poems, generally more successful, appeared in the <span class="italic">Paradise of Dainty Devices</span> (1576), and three more in <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span> (1600); two of the latter, &#145;Doth sorrow fret thy soul?&#146; and &#145;What plague is greater than the grief of mind?&#146;, together with &#145;Faction that ever dwells&#146;, appeared in the appendix to the publisher Newman's surreptitious edition of Sidney's <span class="italic">Astrophel and Stella</span> (1591). Others are found in <span class="italic">The Phoenix Nest</span> (1593) and in <span class="italic">England's Helicon</span> of 1600 (&#145;The Shepherd's Commendation of his Nymph&#146;). The earl is noticed in John Bodenham's <span class="italic">Belvedere, or, The Garden of the Muses</span> (1600). His most attractive poem, a dialogue between the poet and Desire, was first printed imperfectly in Puttenham's <span class="italic">Art of Poesy</span> (1589), and then more correctly in Breton's <span class="italic">Bower of Delights</span> (1597). A few others have been recovered by modern editors from the Rawlinson manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. The surviving poems go some way towards validating the opinion of William Webbe that among the courtier-poets in the early years of Elizabeth, &#145;in the rare devises of poetry, [Oxford] may challenge to him selfe the tytle of the most excellent among the rest&#146;  (Webbe, sig. C3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Some twenty-eight printed books were dedicated to Oxford between 1564 and 1599. Among the more important were <span class="italic">Euphues and his England</span> (1580), the work of his then servant John Lyly, and <span class="italic">Hekatompathia, or, Passionate Centurie of Love</span> (1582), dedicated to Oxford by Thomas Watson with the report that the earl had perused the collection before publication; and Edmund Spenser addressed a sonnet to him (among many other worthies) in the closing pages of his <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span> (1590). Books of smaller account include two translations by Arthur Golding (1564, 1571); four translations by his sometime servant Anthony Munday (1579, 1580, 1588, 1595); <span class="italic">The English Secretarie</span> by Angel Day (1586); and two songbooks by John Farmer (1591, 1599). Claims by literary and historical amateurs, beginning with J. Thomas Looney in 1920 and embraced by Oxford's otherwise worthy biographer B. M. Ward, that Oxford wrote the poems and plays attributed by contemporaries to William Shakespeare, are without merit.<br>
