<span class="headword">Palmer,  Anthony</span>  (<em>c.</em>1675&#150;1749), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was probably born in England but went at an early age to Barbados, where he made a considerable fortune as a merchant at Bridgetown. In 1707 he invested in land in Philadelphia and, after moving there, continued to prosper through his mercantile ventures.<br>
<br>In 1708 Palmer was summoned to the provincial council of Pennsylvania, a position that he held for the rest of his life. He became in 1718 a justice of the peace, and soon after a judge of the court of common pleas, and in 1720 one of the first masters in chancery. In 1747 he was president of the council, and in May, when Governor George Thomas resigned, he assumed the administration of the colony, which he governed for eighteen months through a period of great anxiety. Britain was then at war with France and Spain, whose privateers were making constant attacks along the Delaware coast. The provincial council, which was controlled by Quakers, declined to take measures of defence. Palmer induced his government to act independently, and was remarkably successful. About the same time he made treaties of friendship with several American Indian peoples, especially those of the Six Nations.<br>
<br>In 1730 Palmer purchased Fairman Mansion at Philadelphia: he cut up part of the grounds into building plots, and became the founder of what is now the city's Kensington district. He lived here in some comfort until his death, in Philadelphia, in May 1749. His daughter Thomasine married the son and heir of Sir William Keith, a later governor of Pennsylvania.<br>
