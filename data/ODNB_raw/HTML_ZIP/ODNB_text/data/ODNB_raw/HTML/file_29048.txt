<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Henrietta Maria</span>, <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Wentworth  (1660&#150;1686), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29057/', "Thomas Wentworth, fifth Baron Wentworth (bap. 1613, d. 1665)")</script>, and Philadelphia Carey (<i>d</i>. 1696), daughter of Sir Ferdinando Carey, was born on 11 August 1660. She was the mistress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24879/', "James Scott, duke of Monmouth (1649&#150;1685)")</script>, accompanied him into exile in 1684, and guaranteed the loan which enabled him to launch his ill-fated rebellion in 1685.<br>
<br>Henrietta Wentworth spent her early years at the family manor of Toddington in Bedfordshire, succeeding to the barony of Wentworth after the death of her father in 1665. By 1674 she was at court, taking part in <span class="italic">Calisto</span>, a masque by John Crowne. One of the &#145;men that danced&#146; at the performance was the king's by then celebrated (though illegitimate) son James, duke of Monmouth, and it was probably then that she was introduced to him. Married in 1663 at the age of fourteen to Anne Scott, equally young and heiress to a Scottish title, Monmouth had ignored his young wife and gone on to a career as one of the Restoration's more notorious rakes: besides relationships with various actresses and court women, he had fathered several children by Eleanor Needham, daughter of Sir Richard Needham, by the time he met Henrietta Wentworth.<br>
<br>Nothing seems to have come of any introduction immediately: for the next six years Monmouth was increasingly involved in public activity and there is no reference to a connection with Henrietta Wentworth until 1680. Characteristically (for Monmouth) it came in a scandal: in 1680, and within weeks of each other, two women were obliged to leave London in a hurry for the countryside, and Monmouth's name was associated with both. One was the wife of Ford, Lord Grey, a long-time friend and political associate of the duke, and here the quarrel (if such it was) was quickly patched up. But the other case involved Henrietta Wentworth and was more serious. She was being groomed to marry the young earl of Thanet when Monmouth, then at the height of his influence at court, took a hand. When her mother packed Henrietta off to the countryside &#145;in such haste that it makes a stir&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of &hellip; Sidney</span>, 1.263), the duke followed her to the family manor at Toddington and moved in to begin a permanent relationship. A later plan of the house names two adjoining rooms as &#145;the Duke of Monmouth's Parlor&#146; and &#145;the Lady's parlor&#146;. When implicated in the Rye House plot in 1683, Monmouth retired to Toddington to spend most of that summer in hiding there, writing bad verse on the virtues of a private life, watching the local hunt, and carving Henrietta's name on an oak tree close to the house&#151;a tree thereafter known locally as the Monmouth oak. Restored briefly to favour again in 1684, but finally disgraced for refusing to testify publicly against his whig friends Algernon Sidney and John Hampden, Monmouth revisited Henrietta at Toddington before going into exile in Holland, where she soon joined him.<br>
<br>Henrietta Wentworth was received by William, prince of Orange, as the duke's recognized mistress, and for nearly a year the two lived together in private domesticity, keeping well apart from the other English and Scots exiles and adventurers who thronged the Low Countries. There can be no doubt that the relationship between the two was deep and genuine: certainly Monmouth was a reformed man once his attachment to Henrietta began. Thomas Bruce, earl of Ailesbury, once in love with Henrietta himself, recorded the depth of the couple's attachment to each other, and their sincere belief that in the eyes of God they were man and wife. Their domestic happiness was one reason why Monmouth at first refused to take any action on the shattering news of his father's death in February 1685. But when he finally gave way to the arguments of his fellow exiles that his honour would be irretrievably compromised if he did nothing to stop the accession of his detested Catholic uncle James II, arguments reinforced by the independent preparations for a rebellion in Scotland by the earl of Argyll, Henrietta gave him her fullest support. Unable to raise any money from potential supporters in England, Monmouth had to borrow some &pound;6000 from a Dutch merchant&#151;but could not do so until Henrietta had pledged her jewellery, cash, and credit as security: enough to hire a small ship and buy arms for a few hundred men. Only this backing made the rebellion possible, for Monmouth and his fellow exiles were nearly penniless, and the Dutch government kept a very prudent distance from the enterprise.<br>
<br>On the scaffold after the rebellion's defeat Monmouth renewed his pledges of devotion to Henrietta. When the two bishops present badgered him over his conduct with her, he broke in angrily that he had been married to his wife when only a child, that Henrietta had reclaimed him from a licentious life and he had been faithful to her, and that she was a &#145;religious, godly lady&#146;  (Clifton, 228). Almost his last act was to ask an attendant to convey a memento of him to her. After the execution she remained in Holland until at least mid-August 1685, when she spoke with James II's envoy Bevil Skelton on the shore near Scheveling. According to his hostile account, she seemed mainly concerned about the &pound;4000 of goods and plate of which she had been cheated by one of Monmouth's merchant creditors, haughtily asking him for his help in getting it back, and appearing indifferent to her lover's death: if true, it is likely to be as much a matter of the demeanour required by her situation and the face to be presented to the emissary of her lover's enemy as of a genuine reflection of her feelings.<br>
<br>Not long after this she returned to England, but did not long survive her lover, dying on 23 April 1686: some said of a broken heart, but the vindictive, from over-painting her face with mercury. She was buried at Toddington church, where her mother erected a monument to her in the north transept. The barony passed to Henrietta's aunt Anne, Lady Lovelace, and on her death to her granddaughter Martha Lovelace. Lady Henrietta's estate at death was said to be some &pound;4000 p.a.: her aunt fought her mother over the validity of her will.<br>
