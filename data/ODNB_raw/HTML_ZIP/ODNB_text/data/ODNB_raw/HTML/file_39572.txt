<span class="headword">Davies,  Gwendoline Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Gwen]</span></span>  (1882&#150;1951), <span class="occ">philanthropist and patron of the arts</span>, was born on 11 February 1882 at Plas Dinam, Llandinam, Montgomeryshire, the second of the three children of Edward Davies (1852&#150;1898) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of the Calvinistic Methodist minister the Revd Evan Jones. Gwen Davies's paternal grandfather was the Liberal MP David Davies (1818&#150;1890), who had made his fortune through railways, coal, and dock-building. Together with her younger sister, <a name="cosubject_39572"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Sidney <span class="st"> [Daisy]</span> Davies</span>  (1884&#150;1963)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 14 December 1884, she was educated at home and at Highfield School, Hendon. Gwen became a talented amateur violinist, while Daisy studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, and in Paris. After their mother's death, in 1888, their father married her sister, a dominating person with strict Methodist convictions. The sisters grew up shy and ill at ease in company, and neither married.<br>
<br>The Davies sisters' lives remained somewhat circumscribed until the outbreak of the First World War. Having in 1914 assisted Belgian refugee poets and artists to settle in Wales, in 1916 they opened a canteen in Troyes for French troops. Their ideas about establishing a Welsh centre to further art and design began to take shape early in 1919, when the Davies family were contemplating selling Gregynog, a country house included in an estate near Newtown purchased by their brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32737/', "David Davies, later first Baron Davies of Llandinam (1880&#150;1944)")</script>. On his second marriage, in 1922, the sisters unwillingly left Plas Dinam and moved into Gregynog, whose name soon became synonymous with fine printing, music-making, and art. Under Gwen Davies's supervision the gardens, with their walks and landscaped grounds, provided a fitting setting.<br>
<br>The appointment in 1921 of the artist Robert Ashwin Maynard (1888&#150;1966) as controller marked the beginning of the Gregynog Press, which published forty-two volumes, eight of them in Welsh, in limited editions between 1923 and 1942. It quickly established high standards in design, printing, illustration, and binding and provided training and employment for local people. However, there were constant tensions, not least because the artists employed found life at Methodist, teetotal Gregynog constricting, and Daisy's heart was not in the venture, for her interests were narrower than Gwen's. The sisters relied heavily for advice on the civil servant Thomas Jones (1870&#150;1955) and were assisted by a friend from the Troyes canteen, Dora Herbert Jones, a singer and collector of Welsh folk-songs. Music was central to Gregynog and owed much to the sisters' connections with Sir (Henry) Walford Davies, professor of music at Aberystwyth, where University College benefited from their financial support. At Gregynog a music room was built and a choir established, composed of servants as well as family, friends, and neighbours; rumour had it that a good singing voice was the best qualification for any job on the estate. From 1933 to 1938 a major festival of music and poetry was held each summer, featuring musicians such as Sir Adrian Boult, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Gustav Holst. The house also became the meeting place of the National Council of Music.<br>
<br>Visual art was another lifelong passion for both Gwen and Daisy Davies. Although Daisy was herself a competent artist in oils the sisters' lasting contribution is as collectors, especially in French art, their interest in which can be traced back to their travels in France before the First World War. From 1908 until the early 1920s they bought regularly, with the assistance of Hugh Blaker, brother of their former governess turned companion. They acquired a remarkable collection of oils, watercolours, etchings, engravings, and bronzes, including old masters, contemporary British works, and, most notably, French impressionists, among them works by Corot, Renoir, C&eacute;zanne, and Monet. After Gwen Davies's death, in 1951, her sister resumed buying, selling some of the older works in order to invest in those of living artists. The sisters bequeathed the main collection to the National Museum in Cardiff.<br>
<br>The sisters' commitment to the arts was paralleled by their determination to direct some of their considerable financial resources to relieving living conditions for the poor, especially during the years of the depression, when the plight of industrial south Wales, the source of the family fortune, caused them great distress. As early as 1911 they had helped their brother to set up the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association to establish sanatoria throughout Wales and thereby curb the national scourge of tuberculosis; Daisy Davies later left a large bequest to the Welsh National School of Medicine at Cardiff. Youth and social service organizations were regularly invited to Gregynog, as were staff of clubs and settlements for the unemployed. The sisters' Methodist beliefs strengthened their conviction that wealth brought great responsibility, and the constant demands for charitable donations from all directions became a burden to them.<br>
<br>In 1937 Gwen Davies was made a Companion of Honour. The Second World War brought an end to the sisters' book publishing and large-scale music-making ventures at Gregynog, which became a Red Cross convalescent home. When peace came Gwen Davies's deteriorating health prevented a return to the former activities. She died of leukaemia on 3 July 1951 at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. Daisy Davies, who was made an honorary LLD in 1949, conveyed Gregynog, after much thought, to the University of Wales, living quietly as tenant there until her death, on 13 March 1963, at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in London. Both sisters were cremated (Gwen in Oxford) and their ashes buried in Llandinam churchyard.<br>
