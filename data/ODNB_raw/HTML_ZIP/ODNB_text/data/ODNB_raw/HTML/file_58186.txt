<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jarrett, Sir  Clifford George</span>  (1909&#150;1995), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Dover on 10 December 1909, the older child and only son of George Henry Jarrett (1881&#150;1974), a photographer, and his wife, Kate Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elgar (1883&#150;1963). His childhood was disrupted by the First World War. In 1917, while his father was in the army, a German air raid on Dover made the family home uninhabitable. He moved with his mother and sister to Canterbury, where he entered the Payne Smith elementary school. In 1919, after his father was demobilized, the family returned to Dover. There, he later acknowledged, a superb deputy head and good teaching at St Mary's elementary school helped him to win a scholarship in 1920 to Dover County School for Boys, where he became captain of his house and company quartermaster-sergeant in the cadet corps. In 1927 he won an open scholarship to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Before starting at Cambridge Jarrett taught himself German; he wished to read modern languages, and the county school had taught only French. He went up to Sidney Sussex College in October 1928, graduating in 1931 with a double first in the modern languages tripos. The college extended his scholarship for another year to enable him to read for the history tripos and prepare for the civil service examination. He came first in the administrative class examination of 1932, and joined the Home Office. He soon found it, in his own words, &#145;rather stuffy&#146;, and in 1934 he successfully responded to an Admiralty appeal for experienced assistant principals. It was the start of a departmental career culminating in his appointment twenty-seven years later as the last secretary of the Admiralty.<br>
<br>Jarrett's ability was quickly recognized. Between 1936 and 1938 he was private secretary to two parliamentary secretaries, followed by two years as head of the political section, in which, as the Second World War began, his main task was to monitor breaches of international law by the Germans. When A. V. Alexander succeeded Churchill as first lord in May 1940 Jarrett was appointed his principal private secretary&#151;the most important post in the department for a junior civil servant. It was a tribute to his intellect, character, and stamina that he held it for four years of war, living in the Admiralty building and frequently working a fifteen-hour day. In May 1944 he was promoted to a less demanding post; but he was shortly moved twice to gain experience in other departmental areas, followed by a brief assignment in Ottawa and Washington. In 1946, at the early age of thirty-seven, he was promoted again, to be the under-secretary in charge of all civilian personnel. Four years later he was promoted once more, becoming the sole deputy secretary under Sir John Lang, the secretary of the Admiralty since 1947. It was not, in Jarrett's view, an entirely satisfactory post since important issues had to be considered by the secretary while lesser matters could usually be handled by the under-secretaries. But special tasks fell to him, notably the negotiation in 1955 of the Simonstown naval agreement; and, in a period marked by constant reorganization and retrenchment, and also by such emergencies as the Korean War and the Suez crisis, Jarrett's acute mind and steady hand were invaluable. After eleven years as heir apparent he succeeded Lang as secretary in 1961. It was not to be for long. In 1964 the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, created the unified Ministry of Defence, abolishing separate service departments and redeploying their permanent secretaries to other departments. It was the end of the Admiralty, and its last secretary became permanent secretary of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.<br>
<br>Jarrett took the transition in his stride. His colleagues were impressed by his friendly approach and by his speed in absorbing the intricacies of a fresh field of administration. The newly elected Labour government introduced a succession of departmental changes which he handled with quiet authority: a merger with the Supplementary Benefits Commission, then in 1968 a further merger with the Ministry of Health, thus establishing the Department of Health and Social Security with Jarrett as its first permanent secretary. His secretary of state, Richard Crossman, described him in his <span class="italic">Diaries</span> as &#145;that big, bluff fellow with his blue eyes, his uncomplicated exterior, and his extraordinary competence&#146;  (Crossman, 732); but some other references were disparaging. Jarrett was not alone, however, in finding working relations difficult, and official colleagues took the view that his calm and wise leadership carried the department skilfully through difficult years in the National Health Service and a major attempt to reform the pensions system. The end of Jarrett's career was marred by a personal rift with Crossman, when the latter's strong objection led to the refusal of his request to accept, after retirement, a directorship in the pensions industry. Although pressed to stay longer by Sir Keith Joseph, after a government change in May, he retired as planned in July 1970.<br>
<br>Hard-working as ever, Jarrett remained busy in the subsequent decade. A lifelong pipe smoker, he chaired the Tobacco Research Council, and also a review of the medical services of the armed forces; and he served as a trustee of the National Maritime Museum. He particularly valued his chairmanship of the Dover Harbour Board from 1971 to 1980, during which he saw through a &pound;50 million port expansion programme&#151;a satisfying conclusion to a life which began in Dover more than seventy years earlier.<br>
<br>Jarrett was appointed CBE in 1945 and CB in 1949, being advanced to KBE in 1956. He was twice married: in 1933 to Hilda Alice (1909&#150;1975), daughter of Reginald Goodchild, and in 1978 to Mary Evelyn, a medical librarian (<i>b</i>. 1929), daughter of Charles Beacock. There were one son and two daughters of the first marriage. In 1976 he moved from Chislehurst to 1 the Coach House, Derry Hill, Menston, near Ilkley, Yorkshire, where he died on 9 July 1995; he was cremated on 13 July at Rawdon, Leeds, and his ashes were committed to the waters of Dover harbour three days later. His second wife survived him.<br>
