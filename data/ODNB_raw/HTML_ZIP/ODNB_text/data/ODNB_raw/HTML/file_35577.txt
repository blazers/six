<span class="headword">Portal,  Melville</span>  (1819&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 31 July 1819 at his father's second seat of Freefolk Priors, Hampshire, was the eldest surviving son of John Portal of Freefolk Priors and Laverstoke, Hampshire, head of the Huguenot family of that name, and his second wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of Henry Drummond and Anne Dundas, daughter of Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville. He was sent to Harrow School in 1832 to the house of Archdeacon Phelps, and left in 1837. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 30 May 1838, graduated BA in 1842 with a pass degree, and proceeded MA in 1844. He was treasurer in 1841 and president next year of the Oxford Union, and was an admirer of John Henry Newman, whom he venerated throughout life and who occasionally wrote to him, though Portal's convictions never advanced further towards Rome. With four other young Oxonians he provided the funds for the building of the church of Bussage, a neglected village in Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Entered a student of Lincoln's Inn on 15 April 1842, Portal was called to the bar on 24 November 1845, and went the western circuit. He succeeded to his father's estate in 1848, and at a by-election on 6 April 1849 was elected MP for North Hampshire as a Peelite with a majority of 331 over William Shaw. In July 1852 Portal was re-elected without opposition, and sat until the next general election in 1857, when he retired when faced with two Conservatives. His first speech in the House of Commons was on 25 March 1851, on the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span>. He described it as &#145;the hasty effusion of an off-handed premier&#146; and voted against it. On 9 October 1855 he married Lady Charlotte Mary (<i>d</i>. 1899), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8662/', "Gilbert Elliot Murray Kynynmound, second earl of Minto (1782&#150;1859)")</script>, and his wife, Mary. They had three sons and three daughters. Lady Charlotte was the sister of the wife of Lord John Russell, whom Portal befriended.<br>
<br>Having made no significant national political mark, Portal devoted himself to local affairs in Hampshire. He lived at Laverstoke, and from 1846, when he was appointed a county magistrate, took a prominent part in the judicial and administrative work of the county. In 1863 he was high sheriff and he was deputy lieutenant from 1852, acting as vice-lieutenant in 1887. He was chairman of the judicial business from 1865 to 1889 and of quarter sessions from 1879 to 1903, during which time he reformed the treatment of prisoners in the county gaol. In 1871 Portal persuaded the quarter sessions to order the restoration of the great hall of the castle of Winchester, where the assizes were held, and the work was carried out under his supervision. He published <span class="italic">The Great Hall of Winchester Castle</span> in 1899 and left an unfinished history of Laverstoke church. He died at Laverstoke on 24 January 1904, and was buried in the mortuary chapel in Laverstoke Park. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22555/', "Sir Gerald Herbert Portal")</script>, diplomatist, was one of his sons.<br>
