<span class="headword">Atkins,  Richard</span>  (1559?&#150;1581), <span class="occ">protestant martyr</span>, was the son of William Atkins and a native of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. In early summer 1581 he arrived in Rome. The anonymous <span class="italic">Copie of a Double Letter</span> (1582?), probably by the Jesuit Robert Persons from an eyewitness account, describes him as &#145;of no great yeres&#146;, a &#145;nailesmithe&#146; by trade, short, with auburn hair, a reddish beard, and hardened hands, unlettered except that he could rudely write his name and read &#145;a litle new testament tourned out of Beza his latin&#146; into English. The <span class="italic">Copie</span> reports Atkins's claim that he was a Catholic until the age of nineteen, after that a protestant, and now three years of a &#145;forther faithe&#146; for which he prophesied he would be hanged, in token of which he wore a &#145;figurative&#146; garment with gallows sewn in red cloth on front and back. In England he had already delivered &#145;lewde speaches against the Quene&#146;, but had escaped the death penalty as a &#145;mad man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Copie</span>, 7&#150;8).<br>
<br>Now in Rome, feverish and raving against the pope, Atkins was brought to the English College and nursed back to health&#151;and a renewed intention &#145;to charge the Pope publikely with his sinnes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Copie</span>, 10). The <span class="italic">Copie</span> reports that doctors at the hospital for madmen declared Atkins sane, and refused his care; the Inquisition found him mad, and equally refused his case. A second contemporary account, Anthony Munday's <span class="italic">English Romayne Lyfe</span> (1582; repr. 1590), states that Atkins reproached the members of the English College themselves for their homage to &#145;that filthy Sacrament, which is nothing else but a foolish Idoll&#146;. Munday also credits Atkins with an earlier unsuccessful attack on the host as it was carried in the street, for which he was excused as merely &#145;catch[ing] at the holinesse&#146; coming from the sacrament  (pp. 72&#150;5).<br>
<br>On 23 July, Atkins knocked the chalice from the priest's hand in St Peter's (though before it was fully consecrated), and according to Munday also tried to seize the cake. He was immediately delivered to the Inquisition, where he refused to give up either his heretical beliefs or his intention to rebuke &#145;the Turke, the Pope, &amp; the Quene&#146;, continually quoting scripture in his defence  (<span class="italic">Copie</span>, 15). After a final refusal to recant on 29 July, he was clad in a black cassock painted with flames and conveyed to a prison near the English College.<br>
<br>On 2 August, stripped to the waist, Atkins was set upon an ass and taken to &#145;S. Peters streate, where he was to be bourned&#146;, tormented as he rode by four men who thrust burning torches at his back and breast; there his right hand was cut off and his legs burnt first to prolong the torture. Here the accounts differ sharply, the Catholic writer of the <span class="italic">Copie</span> describing Atkins's &#145;impacience and pucillanimitie&#146; under torture, his attempt to strangle himself with the chain that bound him to hasten his own death, and a final gesture of recantation in which he raised both hand and stump  (<span class="italic">Copie</span>, 18&#150;19). The protestant account of Munday, by contrast, presents a serene Atkins who &#145;suffered all meruailous cheerefully&#146;, leaning into the torches and sometimes seizing them to burn himself  (Munday, <span class="italic">Lyfe</span>, 74).<br>
<br>Munday's illustrated account, reproduced almost verbatim in 1583 by John Foxe in the revision of his <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, may have inspired a flurry of similar desecrations in Rome in November 1581 and January and November 1582, and perhaps even the later act of Walter Marsh, English clergyman and spy, in June 1595.<br>
