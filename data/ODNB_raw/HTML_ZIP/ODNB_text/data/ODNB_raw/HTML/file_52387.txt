<span class="headword">Rothschild,  Anthony Gustav  de</span>  (1887&#150;1961), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 26 June 1887, at 5 Hamilton Place, London, the third child of Leopold de Rothschild (1845&#150;1917), merchant banker, and his wife, Marie (1862&#150;1937), the daughter of Achille Perugia of Trieste. He was head of school at Harrow and attained a double first in history at Trinity College, Cambridge. After leaving Cambridge he joined the family firm of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, which his great-grandfather Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777&#150;1836) had founded.<br>
<br>From 1915 to 1918 Rothschild served with the 1st Royal Buckinghamshire hussars, rising to the rank of major. He was wounded at Gallipoli and later served in France on the general staff. By the time he returned to the bank at New Court, London, the three pre-war partners, Leopold, Alfred, and Nathaniel Mayer de Rothschild, first Baron Rothschild, had died. Anthony and his surviving brother Lionel had been made partners on their father's death in 1917, and they joined Lord Rothschild's son Charles, who was himself to die in 1923. The two brothers alone, therefore, bore the burden of seeing the bank through the difficult inter-war years.<br>
<br>After Lionel's death in 1942 Anthony de Rothschild, by nature a traditionalist, strong-minded in his views and preferring consolidation to change, nevertheless took on as sole partner the task of introducing essential structural changes to the bank. He led the way in such major new initiatives as the re-establishing of a presence in the United States, and he was responsible for a substantial involvement, through the British Newfoundland Company, in the development of an extensive area of Labrador and Newfoundland. In essence he laid the groundwork for the bank's later resurgence. In 1949 a long-standing link between the bank and the Alliance Assurance Company was reinforced by his appointment as chairman of the latter.<br>
<br>In 1926 Rothschild married Lydia Louise Yvonne, daughter of Baron Robert Cahen d'Anvers of Paris. They lived in London at Hill Street, Mayfair, and at Ascott, the Buckinghamshire house inherited from his father. There were three children of the marriage, Ren&eacute;e Louise Marie (<i>b</i>. 1927), Anne Sonia (1930&#150;1971), and Sir Evelyn Robert Adrian (<i>b</i>. 1931), who was to become chairman of the bank. At Ascott, Rothschild continued the family tradition of collecting. He added a substantial range of English furniture and indulged his passion for Chinese ceramics of the Ming and Kangxi dynasties, on which he became a respected authority. The house and much of the collection was given to the National Trust in 1950. Rothschild's other passion, for horse-racing, had been inherited, along with Palace House, Newmarket, and a stable of horses, from his father. He was elected to the Jockey Club in 1925 and later became a trustee. His successes included the Grand Prix de Paris and the One Thousand Guineas. In 1944 he sold his entire stable, and two years later he gave Palace House to the Jockey Club for the use of the royal family.<br>
<br>Rothschild had a deep and eminently practical commitment to public service, particularly for his fellow Jews. When Nazi persecution of German Jewish families began in 1933, he and his brother Lionel were at once active in planning the reception and support of refugees. The inaugural meeting of what was to become the Central British Fund for German Jewry was held at New Court, and Rothschild worked tirelessly behind the scenes of the fund, a resolute fund-raiser and diplomatist. Eventually he took up the chairmanship of the fund, in 1939, and saw it through the war years and beyond. Other work for the Jewish community included the chairmanship of the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company, set up by his uncle to provide homes for Jewish immigrants; the presidency of the Jews' Free School; and, from 1918 to his death, the presidency of the Jewish Orphanage at West Norwood.<br>
<br>Rothschild also served as chairman of the governors of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, in London, from 1948 to 1956, seeing it through the birth pangs of the National Health Service. At that time his views on funding and management were sought, both at the hospital level and at national level (he was a friend of Aneurin Bevan), by the founding fathers of the service. From 1955, when he suffered a stroke, Rothschild's health forced him to withdraw from most of his public and business roles. He died in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 5 February 1961.<br>
