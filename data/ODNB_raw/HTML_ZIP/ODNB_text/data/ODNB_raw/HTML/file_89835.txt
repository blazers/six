<span class="headword">Spiegl,  Fritz</span>  (1926&#150;2003), <span class="occ">musician and humorist</span>, was born on 27 January 1926 at Zumdorf, Austria, near the border with Germany, the son of Rudolf Spiegl, a Catholic agricultural merchant and soda water manufacturer, and his Jewish wife, Josefine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Geiringer. He attended a local Catholic school where, he remembered, the teachers were &#145;either priests or Nazis&#151;or both&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 31 March 2003). When the Nazis moved into Austria a cousin living in Vienna contrived to get Spiegl included in the <i>Kindertransporte</i> which, over a period of nine months, transported to safer countries almost 10,000 children who were considered to be at risk, primarily because they were Jewish. In Britain, Captain David Margesson (chief whip in Neville Chamberlain's government, and then, from 1940 to 1942, secretary for war under Churchill) and his American wife, Frances, took charge of Spiegl at their Northamptonshire home, helped him to learn English, and sent him to Magdalen College School in Oxford. He quickly became a better master of the English language, and its rules and exceptions to rules, than some of his English contemporaries.<br>
<br>In 1941 Spiegl was apprenticed as a typographer and designer with the advertising agency Colman, Prentis, and Varley. There he met a girl who played the flute and inspired him to take it up. By 1946 he was good enough to enter the Royal Academy of Music. Two years later he became principal flute in the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (which in 1957 became the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra). He remained with it for fifteen years, by which time Liverpool had become, and was to remain, his home. He facilitated his own departure from the orchestra in 1963 by deliberately playing a wrong note: an outrage that was forgiven by 1988, when he was made an honorary life member of the orchestra. Over the years he also played for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Hall&eacute; Orchestra, and the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra. Within a few months of joining the Liverpool Philharmonic Spiegl had formed two other musical groups, the Liverpool Music Group and the Liverpool Wind Ensemble. For the Liverpool Music Group he revived Donizetti's opera of 1824, <span class="italic">Emilia di Liverpool</span>.<br>
<br>According to Spiegl, that other musical gadfly Gerard Hoffnung had stolen from him the idea for his 1950s comedy concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. He himself fought his corner with comic concerts in London and Liverpool which included &#145;Nuts in May&#146;, &#145;Midsummer Madness&#146;, and the &#145;April Fool&#146; concerts. His musical rampages included <span class="italic">Psalm 123-and-a-half</span>, <span class="italic">An Old Person's Guide to Contemporary Music</span>, <span class="italic">Liszt Twist</span>, and <span class="italic">Overture to the Magic Carpet</span>. In <span class="italic">A Concerto for Motor Car and Orchestra</span> at the Albert Hall, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, owner of a vintage car museum, took part by sounding the horn of a vintage car when prompted by his score-reading passenger.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1952 Spiegl married Bridget Katharine Fry, a 24-year-old pianist and harpsichordist, and daughter of Rowdon Marrian Fry, physician. They wrote several books together, and had three daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1969, and on 8 December 1976 Spiegl married Ingrid Frances Romnes, a 27-year-old publishing designer, and daughter of Haakon Werner Romnes, a mechanical engineer.<br>
<br>Spiegl's tongue-in-cheek pugnacity could sometimes create difficulties. In 1977 he denounced popular music in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, claiming that it was beneath serious criticism. Its defenders responded by saying that Spiegl had no right to criticize any music when he was the composer of the &#145;banal&#146; music for the popular television series <span class="italic">Z Cars</span>, which began in 1962. In fact it was his first wife, Bridget, who had won the commission to write the signature tune. Spiegl had radically &#145;arranged&#146; an old Liverpool-Irish ballad, &#145;Johnny Todd&#146; by, among other things, giving it an Ulster pipe band. His recording of the tune entered the top ten when released as a single, selling 200,000 copies in its first week. Spiegl also composed and conducted the medley of historic tunes from various parts of the United Kingdom, including <span class="italic">Rule Britannia</span>, <span class="italic">Greensleeves</span>, <span class="italic">Scotland the Brave</span>, <span class="italic">Men of Harlech</span>, the <span class="italic">Londonderry Air</span>, and <span class="italic">What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor?</span>, which was regularly broadcast as the early morning introduction to BBC Radio 4 from the early 1970s, and which provoked public protest on its behalf when in 2006 the BBC's managers proposed to discontinue it in favour of more news bulletins.<br>
<br>From the mid-1960s Spiegl produced much journalism and many books. He wrote regularly for a number of newspapers and magazines, including, eventually, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, <span class="italic">The Oldie</span>, and <span class="italic">BBC Music Magazine</span>. In 1970 he began writing a column for the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span>. For the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, from 1989, he wrote the &#145;Usage and Abusage&#146; column. He was also a prolific writer of letters to newspapers, denouncing those who wrote &#145;days&#146; when they meant &#145;daze&#146;, or vice versa; chiding Tony Blair for sloppily talking of the &#145;enormity&#146; of Labour's majority in 1997; correcting anyone who assumed that all slave-owners were white; and dismissing the theory that cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e came from Scotland by citing a cookery book dated 1738, written for Louis XV by a musical chef who liked singing his own recipe. In 1965 he founded the Scouse Press as a publishing firm and himself co-wrote for it, with Frank Shaw and Stan Kelly, its first book, <span class="italic">Lern Yerself Scouse</span>. In 1986 he published <span class="italic">The Joy of Words</span> and in 1987 <span class="italic">Fritz In-Words and Out-Words</span>. At the very end of his life he was correcting the proofs of his book <span class="italic">Contradictionary: an A&#150;Z of Confusibles, Lookalikes and Soundalikes</span> (2003)&#151;as ever a dedicated, ingenious, and instructively facetious presence. He died on 23 March 2003 at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, following a heart attack. He was survived by his second wife, Ingrid, and the three daughters of his first marriage.<br>
