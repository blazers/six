<span class="headword">Searle,  Thomas</span>  (1777&#150;1849), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of James Searle of Staddlescombe, Devon, was born in Devon on 29 May 1777. He entered the navy in November 1789; served on the Mediterranean, home, and Newfoundland stations; and in 1796 was in the <i>Royal George</i>, flagship of Lord Bridport, by whose interest he was made lieutenant, on 19 August, in the fireship <i>Incendiary</i>. In November 1796 he married, at an early age, Ann, daughter of Joseph Maddock of Plymouth Dock and Tamerton Foliot, Devon. They had a large family: eight daughters survived their father.<br>
<br>In 1797 Searle was in the <i>Prince</i>, flagship of Sir Roger Curtis; in 1798 he was in the frigate <i>Nemesis</i>, on the North American station; and in 1799 he commanded the cutter <i>Courier</i> (12 guns) in the North Sea. On 22 November 1799 he was made commander on the recommendation of Lord Duncan, who was greatly pleased with his activity during the year, and especially with his gallant capture of a large French privateer on 23 November. From June 1800 to October 1802 he was employed in the transport service, and from July 1803 to April 1804 with the Portsmouth division of sea fencibles. From 1804 to 1806 he commanded various small vessels off Boulogne and the north coast of France, and in December 1806 was appointed to the brig <i>Grasshopper</i> (18 guns) for service in the Mediterranean. His service in the <i>Grasshopper</i> was marked, even in that age, &#145;as dashing in the extreme&#146;. On 11 December 1807, off Cape Palos, he engaged a heavily armed Spanish brig of war with two settees (Mediterranean lateen-sailed vessels) in company; he captured the brig and drove the settees to seek safety in flight. Lord Collingwood officially reported the affair as &#145;an instance of the zeal and enterprise which marked Searle's general conduct&#146;  (O'Byrne, <span class="italic">Naval biog. dict.</span>). On 4 April 1808, in company with the frigates <i>Alceste</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, he assisted in destroying or capturing a convoy of merchant vessels at Rota, near Cadiz, after dispersing or sinking the gunboats that escorted them, and silencing the batteries of Rota, which protected them. This last service was performed by the brig alone<blockquote>by the extraordinary gallantry and good conduct of Captain Searle, who kept in upon the shoal to the southward of the town so near as to drive the enemy from their guns with grape from his carronades, and at the same time kept in check a division of the gunboats that had come out from Cadiz to assist the others engaged by the <i>Alceste</i> and <i>Mercury</i>. It was a general cry in both ships: &#145;Only look how nobly the brig behaves&#146;. (Murray Maxwell to the secretary of the Admiralty, <span class="italic">LondG</span>, 23&#150;26 April 1808, 570)</blockquote>Following Maxwell's letter Searle was advanced to post rank on 25 April 1808, though the promotion did not reach him until July. Meanwhile, on 23 April, in company with the brig <i>Rapid</i> on the south coast of Portugal, he fell in with two richly laden Spanish vessels from South America, under convoy of four gunboats. The merchant ships ran in under the batteries of Faeroe, by which they were protected. However, the brigs, having captured two of the gunboats, driven the other two on shore, and silenced the batteries, brought off the ships which were carrying cargoes of the value of &pound;60,000.<br>
<br>On leaving the <i>Grasshopper</i>, Searle was presented by the crew with an 80 guinea sword and, shortly after, by Lloyd's with a piece of plate worth 100 guineas. In 1809 he commanded the <i>Frederickstein</i> (32 guns) in the Mediterranean, in 1810&#150;11 the <i>Elizabeth</i> (74 guns) in the North Sea and at Lisbon, and in 1811&#150;12 the frigate <i>Druid</i> in the Mediterranean. On 4 June 1815 he was made a CB.<br>
<br>From 1818 to 1821 he commanded the frigate <i>Hyperion</i> (42 guns) in the channel (in attendance on George IV) and in a voyage to South America, from which he brought back specie worth half a million sterling. From 1836 to 1839 he was captain of the <i>Victory</i> (104 guns), at that time guardship at Portsmouth; and on 9 November 1847 he was promoted rear-admiral. He died at his home, Kingston House, Portsea, Hampshire, on 18 March 1849 and was buried at the garrison chapel in Portsmouth. Searle, a handsome, strongly built man of middle height, with black hair and dark complexion, had a remarkable career, made by exceptional skill and courage.<br>
