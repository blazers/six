<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kavanagh,  Patrick Joseph</span>  (1904&#150;1967), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 21 October 1904 at the family home in Mucker, a townland in the parish of Inniskeen, co. Monaghan, Ireland, the elder son and fourth of the ten children of James Kavanagh (1855&#150;1929), a cobbler, and his wife, Bridget (1872&#150;1945), daughter of Patrick and Mary Quinn, farmers. James Kavanagh bought a 9 acre farm in 1910 and Patrick was removed from school at the age of thirteen to embark on the career of cobbler-cum-subsistence farmer. Though the rest of his siblings left home in their teens and early twenties, most entering the nursing or teaching professions, he lived and worked on the family smallholding until he was thirty-five.<br>
<br>As a schoolboy Kavanagh was rather lackadaisical and displayed no particular aptitude for literature, but he developed a passion for poetry in his teenage years and secretly pursued a literary education, reading and versifying in his spare time. Books, other than school texts, were scarce in this hard-pressed society and he knew nothing about contemporary literature until 1925, when by chance he picked up a copy of the <span class="italic">Irish Statesman</span> in a newsagent's. From then until it folded in 1930, this weekly journal of arts and ideas, edited by George Russell (A. E.), was his main educational resource. By 1929 he had learnt to write the kind of vague religio-rural rhymed verse that A. E. favoured and three of his poems were accepted for publication, among them &#145;Ploughman&#146;.<br>
<br>In December 1931 Kavanagh visited Dublin for the first time to meet A. E.&#151;walking there rather than taking the train, to exaggerate his peasant status. A. E., who had a reputation for fostering young talent, lent him books, dispensed literary advice, and introduced him to other writers such as Frank O'Connor. He became a frequent visitor to Dublin and was soon <i>au fait</i> with what was happening on the Irish literary scene. The <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span> began publishing his verse in 1931, and from that year it also began to appear in English journals such as <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and <span class="italic">John O'London's</span>. His first collection, <span class="italic">&#145;Ploughman&#146; and other Poems</span> (1936), consists for the most part of slight apprentice offerings, the chief exception being the sonnet, &#145;Inniskeen Road: July Evening&#146;, a rueful, yet playful, meditation on the anomaly of being a poet in his native village.<br>
<br>In 1937 Kavanagh went to London for a time to seek literary employment and was commissioned to write <span class="italic">The Green Fool</span> (1938), an autobiography with an anthropological dimension, combining a portrait of the artist with a portrait of his society. The mandate to provide a narrative about small-farm life in Ireland compelled Kavanagh to attend to the subject which was closest to him but which he had so far virtually ignored. <span class="italic">The Green Fool</span>, which took a fresh and light-hearted approach to life in an Irish village and modulated easily from the comic to the lyrical, received rave reviews in the Irish and English press, but was withdrawn in 1939 following a successful libel suit by Oliver St John Gogarty. Gogarty, a practising doctor as well as an author, took offence because on page 300 Kavanagh had commented that on his first visit to the city he had called at his house and was unsure whether the white-robed maid who answered the door was his wife or mistress.<br>
<br>Kavanagh moved to Dublin in 1939 to become a full-time writer and, apart from some lengthy stays in London and Inniskeen, he lived there for the rest of his life. During his first Dublin years he benefited from the cult of peasantry which had been a feature of the Irish literary revival and was welcomed and patronized by the city's literati as a harmless na&iuml;f. In dress and appearance he still looked like a farmer. Not particularly tall at 5 feet 10&frac12; inches, he none the less conveyed an impression of ungainly size because of his broad frame, large hands and feet, and ploughman's gait. Under the influence of Sean O'Faolain, editor of a new monthly journal, <span class="italic">The Bell</span> (October 1940&#150;1946), and Frank O'Connor, its first poetry editor, he soon began to perceive himself as a post-literary revival and post-independence writer, one of a new generation of disillusioned realists intent on portraying contemporary Irish life, warts and all. He projected himself as the &#145;voice of the people&#146;, the authentic and articulate expresser of a rural Catholic Ireland that he saw as grossly misrepresented by literary revival writers such as W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, and, especially, J. M. Synge. Possessed by a missionary zeal to counter inherited literary images of the peasant, he quickly progressed from brief, affectionately realist lyrics such as &#145;Spraying the Potatoes&#146;, &#145;A Christmas Childhood&#146;, and &#145;Art McCooey&#146; to <span class="italic">The Great Hunger</span> (1942), a rhetorically powerful poem of 758 lines offering an authoritative and shocking indictment of small-farm Ireland.<br>
<br>Its central protagonist, Patrick Maguire, a typical Irish subsistence farmer, is an elderly bachelor who has sacrificed sexuality to agricultural productivity, living &#145;that his little fields may stay fertile&#146;. The poem criticizes the contemporary Irish small-farm ethos in which a puritanical Catholicism and a preoccupation with economic security combine to render men's and women's lives joyless and unfulfilled. Technically as well as thematically daring, it is written in a mix of free-verse paragraphs and rhymed stanzas, and exploits cinematic strategies of montage. Though some Dublin critics were uncomfortable with <span class="italic">The Great Hunger</span>'s innovative techniques and disruption of literary pieties about the peasantry, Kavanagh was now widely recognized as a force to be reckoned with in Irish letters.<br>
<br>In another long and only posthumously published poem, <span class="italic">Lough Derg</span> (1978), he experimented with broadening his cultural analysis to present an anatomy of Catholic Ireland, urban and rural, north and south. He then abandoned socio-realist verse. His post-war collection of poems, <span class="italic">A Soul for Sale</span> (1947), was respectfully received and <span class="italic">The Great Hunger</span>, which many English and American critics were reading for the first time in that volume because it had previously appeared in a limited edition, was singled out as a major twentieth-century poem.<br>
<br>Since he could not survive on the pittance he earned from his poetry, Kavanagh had been assiduously seeking a well-paid job or sinecure since his first days in Dublin. Lack of academic qualifications and political connections rendered him ineligible for most positions, and the only regular employment he was offered in the 1940s was as a twice-weekly columnist with a daily newspaper, the <span class="italic">Irish Press</span> (September 1942&#150;February 1944), and as a staff journalist (August 1945&#150;April 1947) and film critic (February 1946&#150;July 1949) with a Catholic weekly paper, <span class="italic">The Standard</span>. Embittered by middle-class Dublin's refusal to proffer him patronage or at times even the means of earning a livelihood while writers whose work he despised were salaried and secure, he produced a series of satires excoriating Dublin as a cultural mediocracy and casting himself in the role of outcast genius. The best of these was &#145;The Paddiad&#146; (1949), based on the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>. Satire, as he gradually came to recognize, was &#145;unfruitful prayer&#146;  (&#145;Auditors In&#146;), corroding him spiritually as well as frittering his talent. The supreme literary virtue which he endeavoured, often vainly, to cultivate from the late 1940s was what he termed comedy, a humorous, affectionate, yet disengaged art.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Tarry Flynn</span>, the autobiographical novel about the life of a farmer&#150;poet he had been attempting to write since 1940, eventually appeared in full in 1948; it was a realistic but mellow and often very funny portrayal of his Inniskeen milieu. This novel had its advocates from the beginning but its shelf life was short because the London publisher, the Pilot Press, went into liquidation. Its present status as a classic of Irish fiction dates from its reissue as a paperback in 1962 and its many subsequent reprintings.<br>
<br>One of the cultural legacies of the Irish struggle for independence was an emphasis on ethnicity and nationalism in literature, a trend so antipathetic to Kavanagh that he once declared, &#145;Irishness is a form of anti-art&#146;  (<span class="italic">X</span>, August 1961). His opposition to an ethnic aesthetic, evident from 1947, took two contrary forms. First, he countered the &#145;myth of Ireland as a spiritual entity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Studies</span>, spring 1959)&#151;which he attributed to the literary revival writers, especially Yeats&#151;with a &#145;parish myth&#146; presenting the country as a mosaic of distinctive parishes rather than as a monolith. <span class="italic">Tarry Flynn</span> is the finest instance of what Kavanagh called &#145;parochialism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kavanagh's Weekly</span>, 24 May 1952), an art that has the courage to focus on the local and familiar. In his sonnet &#145;Epic&#146;, Homer makes the Iliad out of a &#145;local row&#146;. Second, and more persistently from 1950 onwards, he demanded that writing should reveal the personality rather than the nationality of the writer. A new Irish monthly journal of arts and letters, <span class="italic">Envoy</span> (December 1949&#150;July 1951), to which he contributed a monthly diary, gave him a platform to communicate his subversive views on contemporary Irish life and letters. He indulged this vein even further in <span class="italic">Kavanagh's Weekly</span>, a short-lived journal which he edited and co-wrote with his brother Peter (12 April 1952&#150;5 July 1952). <span class="italic">Kavanagh's Weekly</span>, which was critical of the government, of almost every state institution, and of many prominent figures in Irish public and artistic life, won him numerous enemies and its collapse left him destitute and unemployable.<br>
<br>Kavanagh's own life as a Dublin writer and character was becoming his poetic theme from 1950 onwards. A distinctive figure about town because of his unkempt, countrified appearance, abrasive turn of phrase, and booming voice, he took to boozing and gambling on horses in middle age. Among his intimates he was an entertaining and humorous companion. His cultivation of a crusty and abusive public manner was largely a way of fending off intrusiveness, but he had also been soured by financial insecurity. Though widely recognized as Ireland's leading poet he was pathetically poor and dependent for survival on loans and handouts from well-off supporters and on the nurture and sympathy of numerous women friends, &#145;Rescue work with kiss or kitchens&#146;  (&#145;Prelude&#146;). In a frank, laid-back, casual vernacular verse that drew on metaphors from racecourse, betting shop, street, and pub and blended journalistic clich&eacute; and literary allusion, he analysed his daily experiences and his psyche: his insolvency, alcoholism, temperamental cussedness, failures as a lover, and abiding belief in the importance of poetry. Among the best of these lyrics centring on the persona of an endearing, fallible figure, usually intent on self-reform, are &#145;Auditors In&#146;, &#145;Prelude&#146;, and &#145;If ever you go to Dublin town&#146;.<br>
<br>In the hope of making some easy money Kavanagh took a libel action against <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, an Irish journal which had printed an unsigned &#145;profile&#146; of him in October 1952. The profile depicted him hunkered on a bar stool surrounded by young disciples whom he verbally abused, but it went on to praise his poetry, especially <span class="italic">The Great Hunger</span>. The case, heard in February 1954, was a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> and earned Kavanagh considerable notoriety but no money. He lost, later won the right to appeal, and eventually settled out of court, only to discover that the defendants had virtually no assets.<br>
<br>The stress of this court case also took a severe toll on his health. A heavy cigarette smoker all his life, he was found to be suffering from lung cancer in March 1955. He was operated on, had a lung removed, and made a good recovery, though he never regained his former robustness. That period of his convalescence spent lying day after day on the bank of Dublin's Grand Canal in the warm July of 1955 entered his self-mythologizing as a time when he was born or reborn as a celebratory, lyrical poet whose role was to:<blockquote>
<div>be reposed and praise, praise, praise<br>
</div>
<div>The way it happened and the way it is.<br>
</div> (&#145;Question to Life&#146;)</blockquote>In the late 1950s he published a series of sonnets expressing this rapturous mood and written in an improvisatory, colloquial style, among them &#145;The Hospital&#146;, &#145;Canal Bank Walk&#146;, &#145;Lines Written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin&#146;, &#145;October&#146;, &#145;Come Dance with Kitty Stobling&#146;, and &#145;The One&#146;. These were collected in <span class="italic">Come Dance with Kitty Stobling</span> (1960), which was widely and enthusiastically reviewed and was a British Poetry Society choice for summer 1960.<br>
<br>Equally at home among the literary and artistic sets in Soho and Dublin, Kavanagh was held in high esteem and affection by the upcoming generation of Irish poets in the 1960s. His years of penury and near-destitution were at an end: a regular income came from an extra-mural lectureship at University College, Dublin, from May 1955, a weekly column of reminiscences about his farming days in the <span class="italic">Irish Farmers Journal</span> (June 1958&#150;March 1963), and a chat column in the <span class="italic">RTE Guide</span> (April 1963&#150;June 1967). His <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was published to much critical acclaim in 1964, his <span class="italic">Collected Prose</span> followed in 1967, and <span class="italic">Tarry Flynn</span>, adapted for Dublin's Abbey Theatre by P. J. O'Connor in 1966, was a box-office hit.<br>
<br>On 19 April 1967 Kavanagh married a long-time friend, Katherine Barry Maloney (1928&#150;1989), and they settled in Dublin. A niece of the martyr patriot Kevin Barry, Katherine came from a prominent republican family in Dublin but had been working in London as a bookkeeper since the late 1950s. Kavanagh lived with her during his frequent stays in London from about 1960 onwards. They had many friends in common in literary and artistic circles, shared an interest in all forms of sport, were drinking companions, and, in addition, Katherine was devoted to his welfare.<br>
<br>In the final years of his life Kavanagh was plagued by poor health, largely consequent on the alcoholism to which he had been succumbing since the early 1950s, and he was frequently hospitalized. He died of pneumonia in the Merrion Nursing Home, Dublin, on 30 November 1967 and on 2 December was buried, as he had requested, in his native Inniskeen.<br>
<br>Too little known outside Ireland because of disputes over copyright and consequent limitations on the distribution of his poetry, Patrick Kavanagh is acknowledged by most Irish poets who began writing in the 1960s and thereafter as a pivotal figure in twentieth-century Irish literature and as a seminal influence on Irish verse. By precept and example he steered Irish poetry away from its post-colonial obsession with ethnicity in theme and language and its preference for the historical and national rather than the contemporary and personal. He advocated that poetry should be confessional yet carefree; draw its images from the trivia of everyday life and its language from the argot of street and pub; cultivate a casual, relaxed vernacular style, avoiding the bardic or technically intricate; above all, that it should convey personality, capture a mood or an attitude&#151;wonder, love, delight, pain. His message to Irish poets was to de-nationalize and &#145;try to be more human&#146;.<br>
