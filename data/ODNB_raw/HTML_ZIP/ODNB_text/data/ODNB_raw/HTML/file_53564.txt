<span class="headword">Terry,  Joseph</span>  (1793&#150;1850), <span class="occ">confectioner</span>, was born on 11 November 1793 at Pocklington, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Terry, a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Dales. After serving an apprenticeship, he opened an apothecary's shop in Walmgate, York. In 1823 he married Harriet, the daughter of William Atkinson, of Leppington Grange, near York; they had five sons and three daughters. Harriet was the sister-in-law of Robert Berry, of the confectioners Bayldon and Berry, in St Helen's Square, York, since 1767. After Berry's death, Joseph joined his son in the euphonious partnership of Terry and Berry. By 1830 he was in sole charge of the business, making cakes and sugar confectionery, marmalade, mushroom ketchup, and medicated lozenges.<br>
<br>During the 1830s Terry established retail agencies in no fewer than seventy-five towns, mostly in northern England and the midlands, but also in London and Luton. In 1836 he helped to form an association in London to protect the consumer against the adulteration of the products of confectioners and lozenge makers. A roly-poly of a man, bald on top, but with plentiful side hair and mutton-chop whiskers, he died at West Huntington, York, on 8 June 1850, survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Joseph Terry's second son, <a name="cosubject_53564"></a><span class="headword">Sir Joseph Terry</span>  (1828&#150;1898)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in York on 7 January 1828, and educated at St Peter's School. He then joined the family firm, which in 1851 had 127 employees. After an interregnum when it was run by executors, Joseph and his two younger brothers took control of the firm in 1854. That year he married Frances, the daughter of Dr Joseph Goddard of London; they had three sons before she died in 1866.<br>
<br>Always the dominant partner, Joseph Terry put his abundant energies into expanding the firm. In 1864 he transferred manufacturing to a new site in York, where he erected a steam-powered factory. Two years later there were 400 different items in the price list. In 1871 he married Margaret, the daughter of William Thorpe of Aldborough House, Malton, Yorkshire, with whom he had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Their eldest son, Thomas, a partner after 1880, built up exports to Australia and New Zealand. During that decade the firm received a number of exhibition awards for its confectionery. Since at least the 1860s it had been making chocolate products, but its reputation in these lines grew only after Joseph Terry built a separate chocolate factory in 1886. It was incorporated as Joseph Terry &amp; Sons Ltd in 1895, when it had 300 employees.<br>
<br>On York city council from 1860, Terry served as sheriff of York in 1870, and was later lord mayor four times; he was knighted in 1887. He assisted all the main societies and associations in York, from the school of art to the city's cricket club and the asylum. His craggy and bearded face hid a genial and benevolent disposition. He was a freemason, a member of the York Sunday school committee, and president of the York Conservative Association. However, he overexerted himself in a by-election in the city, and died of heart failure at the Royal Station Hotel on 12 January 1898. He was buried at York cemetery on 15 January 1898. He was survived by his wife.<br>
