<span class="headword">Gott,  Benjamin</span>  (1762&#150;1840), <span class="occ">cloth merchant and manufacturer</span>, was born on 24 June 1762 at Woodhall, Calverley, near Leeds, the fifth of the six children of John Gott (1720&#150;1793), an engineer and surveyor of bridges for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and his second wife, Susanna Jackson of Bradford. He was educated at Bingley grammar school and then, in 1780, apprenticed with the Leeds merchant house of Wormald and Fountaine. His father paid the large premium of &pound;400 for his four-year period of training. It was money well spent. Running one of the top half-dozen firms of cloth merchants in the town, Wormald and Fountaine (related by marriage) were prominent members of the Leeds &eacute;lite, both men having served office as mayor in the late 1770s. On new year's day 1785, straight out of his apprenticeship, Gott became a junior partner in the firm; his father raised &pound;3660, admitting his son to a one-eleventh share of its capital and profits. Barely had the ink dried on the deed than John Wormald died, leaving three teenage sons for whom a share in the management of the firm had been explicitly reserved. Half a dozen years later Joseph Fountaine was dead, with an only daughter eager to withdraw her large interest from the business. Gott, not yet thirty, had become senior partner in one of the West Riding's principal merchant houses.<br>
<br>The second half of the 1780s and the early 1790s (in sharp contrast to the years 1775&#150;83) were prosperous ones for the Yorkshire cloth industry. And in terms of technology they were momentous. Although the lead in the mechanization of its traditional processes in textile manufacture was given by the cotton industry, there were three innovations in the making of wool textiles in the West Riding during these years: spinning by the jenny; scribbling (preliminary carding) and carding by a machine adapted from Arkwright's water frame; and, not before 1792, the introduction of Boulton and Watt's rotary steam engine in Leeds. Gott, young, immensely talented, with a decade's training in a first-rate firm behind him, and, equally importantly, with its capital resources&#151;if he could communicate his vision to his young Wormald partners&#151;at his command, made the boldest of entrepreneurial leaps in 1792. He built the first large-scale factory in the West Riding woollen industry on a green-field site, Bean Ing, to the west of the smart Georgian squares and terraces of Leeds. Previously, merchants had not manufactured their own cloth, but bought it in the cloth halls or to order from some of the county's thousands of independent clothiers. Gott constructed a large factory (its buildings and machinery were insured for &pound;10,000 to &pound;12,000 when it was destroyed by fire in 1799), powered by a big 40 hp Boulton and Watt engine. In production eighteen months later, the factory housed the entire gamut of machinery necessary to produce and finish cloth.<br>
<br>By no means all of Gott's machinery was steam driven: the jennies, looms, and finishing tools definitely were not. In many ways the factory was a half-way house between the old domestic system of production and the large scale, power-driven factories of the 1820s and 1830s. Certainly, Gott continued to buy cloth in the halls (indeed he remained principally a great export merchant, selling three times more cloth than he made himself), and at Armley, one of the two other water-driven mills he later acquired, he continued to provide scribbling and fulling services for the district's independent clothiers. Nevertheless, the scale of his enterprise was exceptional. Park Mills at Bean Ing employed 761 workers in 1813; six years later, on 31 July 1819 (a difficult year for the cloth industry), the total work force, there and at Gott's other two mills and warehouse, was 1019. In the late 1790s and 1800s his enterprise, together with that of a handful of other merchants running mills on a smaller scale, unnerved the entire cloth industry, creating the impression that the merchants would become factory owners, thereby squeezing out of existence the small, independent clothiers. The progress to a complete factory system, thoroughly examined in the famous <span class="italic">Report on the State of the Woollen Manufacture of England</span> (1806), in fact took more than half a century to complete.<br>
<br>Gott steered the great firm for more than thirty years before two of his sons, John (1791&#150;1867) and William (1797&#150;1863), took over in the mid-1820s, when the factory was twice extended and power-driven spinning mules and cloth-finishing machinery were installed. Although few accounts have survived among the Gott papers, it was clearly a most profitable venture&#151;the return on Gott's great entrepreneurial vision. And in his early experiments with steam in the dyeing processes he was a bold innovator. The family's entry in the 1937 edition of Burke's <span class="italic">Landed Gentry</span> described him simply as &#145;one of the founders of the modern woollen industry in Yorkshire&#146;. Yet in many ways Gott was not in the Arkwright mould of <i>nouveau riche</i> factory masters.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1790 Gott married Elizabeth (1768&#150;1857), the daughter of William and Elizabeth Rhodes of Badsworth, with whom he had four sons and six daughters. A cultured woman, a regular churchgoer, and a socialite, she proved to be the ideal wife for the Conservative, Anglican Gott. A friend described her as &#145;a woman of infinite charm &hellip; possessed of great dignity and good looks&#146;  (Gott MS 194). At first Gott did the things expected of a leading member of the tory merchant &eacute;lite in Leeds: he was mayor in 1799 and captain commandant of the Leeds Volunteers. In 1803 he acquired Armley House, a pleasant villa on the edge of Leeds, as a rural retreat for his large family. Seven years later he commissioned the leading landscape architect Humphry Repton to design its 76 acre park, most unusually incorporating distant views of his factory and Leeds into the plans. And in 1822 Sir Robert Smirke was engaged to remodel Armley House in the Greek-revival style as a fitting home for his growing art collection.<br>
<br>The Gotts led a cultured life in Leeds. He was prominent in the affairs of the Northern Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in 1809, lending Dutch and Italian pictures from his collection for its exhibitions, and generously patronizing a clutch of contemporary artists practising in the West Riding&#151;Charles Schwanfelder, J. H. Rhodes, and J. C. Ibbetson. He was instrumental in securing commissions in Leeds for Francis Chantrey (Gott owned busts of James Watt and John Rennie by him) and John Flaxman, and he and Mrs Gott sat to Sir Thomas Lawrence for two fine portraits in 1826. Above all he patronized his second cousin, the sculptor Joseph Gott (1785&#150;1860), from whom he commissioned between 1826 and 1840 &#145;work for the Gott family &hellip; striking both in its quantity and diversity: monuments, portrait busts, medallions and figures, groups of children and children with animals, ancient and modern mythology and pugilism&#146;  (Friedman and Stevens, 16). Gott was the first president of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society (established 1818) and a founding member of the Leeds Mechanics' Institute (1824).<br>
<br>Life was not all profits and paintings. At times Gott was dogged by controversy. About 1800 he was involved in a protracted and bitter dispute with the master cloth dressers about the introduction of finishing machinery and apprenticeships. In 1824 he was prosecuted for smoke nuisance: the emissions from his and neighbouring mills, driven down the Aire valley by the prevailing westerlies, had effectively ruined the Georgian Parks development for its middle-class inhabitants. He was chairman of the Leeds and Selby Railway Company (1830), an early rail venture established, amid conflict, to provide an alternative route to Hull to that afforded by the long-founded, immensely profitable Aire and Calder Navigation Company.<br>
<br>Gott died at Armley House on 14 February 1840 and was buried at Armley Chapel. Joseph Gott erected a monument (removed to St Bartholomew's Church, Armley, in 1890) archly described by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as a &#145;comfortable semi-reclining figure on a mattress rolled up at the top. He is wearing a dressing gown&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire: the West Riding</span>, 1959, 323). Gott was survived by two of his four sons (Benjamin had died in Athens in 1817 while collecting classical marbles, his brother Henry in Paris in 1825), who ran the firm until 1867, when it ceased cloth production.<br>
