<span class="headword">Neurath,  Walter</span>  (1903&#150;1967), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born in Josefst&auml;dterstrasse, Vienna, on 1 October 1903, the only child of Alois Neurath (1872&#150;1934) and his wife, Gisela Fr&ouml;hlich (<i>d</i>. 1944). The Neurath family came from Bratislava and Alois Neurath arrived in Vienna aged twenty-one; he worked in a bank until he was twenty-eight, when he founded his own business as a wholesale importer of tea, coffee, and luxury foods. Walter Neurath spent his entire childhood in Vienna, where he was educated at the Volks Schule and the Real Gymnasium from which he matriculated with distinction. He then attended the University of Vienna where he studied art history, archaeology, and history, becoming, in 1922, a member of the Institute for Art History. At the same time he worked for the art book publisher W&uuml;rthle &amp; Sohn and organized various art exhibitions&#151;including one in Paris&#151;of nineteenth-century French paintings from Viennese collections. He also lectured on art history to the Austrian equivalent of the Workers' Educational Association.<br>
<br>Neurath was a founder member of Neustift (&#145;new foundations&#146;), a small left-wing commune of intellectuals with a radical approach to both life and culture which included the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, whose seminal work on the German concentration camps, <span class="italic">The Informed Heart</span>, Neurath was to publish with great success nearly forty years later. In 1925 Neurath married Lilly Kruk (a marriage which was dissolved in 1933) and, because of his father's ill health, joined and ran the family firm, thus acquiring considerable routine business skills. On his father's recovery in 1929 Neurath turned to full-time publishing, with a strong interest in printing and typography. He joined the Verlag f&uuml;r Kulturforschung (&#145;publishing house for cultural research&#146;), and Zinner Verlag, which published fiction and where, after six months, he was made production director. There he published a number of illustrated books, and the German language translations of English and American books. The rise to power in Germany of the Nazi party effectively closed the main German language market for this Jewish firm which therefore decided to close down.<br>
<br>From 1935 to 1937 Neurath worked as an educational publisher, developing new illustration techniques and creating, as general editor, a series of illustrated textbooks for children designed as an educational counter-influence to Nazi ideology. The books had a strong democratic and anti-totalitarian bias and were translated into seven foreign languages by like-minded publishers abroad. In 1937 Neurath was appointed manager of the Wilhelm Frick publishing house, where he continued to commission and publish both illustrated books on the arts and anti-Nazi propaganda. However, on the occupation of Austria by the Nazis he was ordered to cease publishing immediately and a Nazi-approved &#145;Commissar&#146; was appointed to run the house.<br>
<br>Because of his anti-Nazi publishing activities, Neurath was soon on the Gestapo lists and, after several near misses and a period in hiding, managed to escape to England on 1 June 1938, taking with him his second wife, Marianne M&uuml;ller (1909&#150;1950), a schoolteacher. His sponsor for entry into England as an alien was Frances Margesson, wife of Captain (later Viscount) Margesson; the Neuraths stayed with the Margessons at Boddington, near Rugby, for some five years and their son Thomas was born there. Neurath was offered work by a company called Adprint, run by a fellow refugee, Wolfgang Foges. He soon became the production manager and both designed and produced the celebrated <span class="roman">King Penguin</span> series. It was originally intended to print this series in Czechoslovakia, but Germany's invasion of that country also meant that the books, published by Allen Lane of Penguin Books, were printed in England. Belonging as he did to a European tradition of publishing where the series was the norm if not the rule, Neurath frequently thought in series terms rather than single volumes. Thus, after the success of what were in effect Penguin's first hardcover books, the beautifully made, jewel-like <span class="roman">King Penguins</span>, he developed a larger and more ambitious series called <span class="roman">Britain in Pictures</span>, edited by W. J. Turner.<br>
<br>A formidably scholarly and erudite man, Neurath had a genius for making illustrations an integral part of a book, placing them prominently on the page together with the words to which they were related, rather than banishing them to the plates section in the centre or (worse still) at the back of the book. <span class="roman">Britain in Pictures</span> married skilful picture research and fine design and printing with significant texts from George Orwell (<span class="italic">The English People</span>), Rose Macaulay (<span class="italic">Life among the English</span>), John Piper (<span class="italic">British Romantic Artists</span>), Michael Ayrton (<span class="italic">British Drawings</span>), and Jacquetta Hawkes (<span class="italic">Early Britain</span>); the series eventually comprised more than 100 volumes.<br>
<br>Just as the series was about to be launched the Second World War broke out, leading to paper rationing which was based on publishers' output in preceding years. A new firm, Adprint had no proper track record with which to secure a paper ration. The &#145;book packager&#146; emerged, becoming a significant part of book publishing in the second half of the twentieth century. The packager put together author and subject and looked after the design of a book all the way through to complete production by a publisher with an adequate paper ration; it was that publisher whose name appeared on the jacket, spine, and title-page of the book. Neurath's brilliant series was actually successfully published by Collins, who also took on his next project, the even more numerous and more permanently successful <span class="roman">New Naturalist</span> series, edited by Julian Huxley. At a stroke, Adprint and Neurath had become a significant force in quality illustrated book publishing in Britain. The path was, however, not wholly smooth or unbroken: Neurath was not yet a naturalized British subject and was dispatched to an internment camp in the Isle of Man, alongside the Amadeus Quartet and other distinguished and blameless European artists and intellectuals viewed as &#145;enemy aliens&#146;. Happily, aware that the <span class="roman">Britain in Pictures</span> series had considerable propaganda value, a friendly civil servant, Richard Cowell, managed to get Neurath released rapidly and he was soon back at work, with eventual naturalization as a British subject to follow.<br>
<br>Neurath stayed with Adprint, which was, however, less successful once the war ended. The firm had been financed by Tennants and its head, Lord Glenconner, lost faith in Foges and offered the managing directorship to Neurath, who declined it. He had more ambitious ideas and, on an exceedingly modest capital of &pound;7000, departed to found Thames and Hudson in September 1949. His own contribution was his life savings of &pound;3000; his co-directors included his Adprint colleague Eva Feuchtwang (who contributed her own savings of &pound;150) and&#151;shrewdly on Neurath's part&#151;the printer John Jarrold and the process engraver Wilfrid Gilchrist. The firm's first book was a translation of a photographic work, <span class="italic">English Cathedrals</span>, by the Swiss photographer and publisher Martin H&uuml;rlimann. Happily this was successful and Neurath built on his American connections. The publishing house was named after the rivers of London and New York, to signify its ambition to publish on both sides of the Atlantic. However, the point was frequently missed in the business world and letters addressed to Mr Thames and Mr Hudson were often received.<br>
<br>Because of Neurath's high reputation in America and because editing, design, printing, and binding were then much cheaper in England and Europe than in the United States, American art book publishers such as Abrams and the great museums such as the Metropolitan and the Museum of Modern Art in New York not only appointed Thames and Hudson as their representative, but also relied on the firm to package some of their more complex art historical books, as well as publishing under the firm's imprint in the UK. Thames and Hudson thus simultaneously established its Anglo-American business and acquired an immediate turnover base and a niche in the English publishing market. Neurath's second wife, Marianne, had died in 1950, and on 6 August 1953 he married his longtime colleague Eva Urvasi Feuchtwang (1908&#150;1999) who, as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73686/', "Eva Neurath")</script>, was his full business partner as well as his wife and made an essential contribution to the success of the firm.<br>
<br>At that time the leading art book publishing house in England was the Phaidon Press, established by Neurath's fellow Viennese refugee Bela Horovitz, who had transferred his existing business to London in 1938. Their books were of the conventional kind, separating text and plates and rarely using colour. The Neuraths, having already established the integration of text and illustrations, also pioneered the use of a much higher proportion of colour illustration which, because of its much greater engraving and printing costs, was a brave departure in the 1950s. Neurath invariably not only planned his books on an Anglo-American axis but also aimed at the European market, producing books which were simultaneously translated into the principal western European languages and printed for publishers both in the major publishing countries such as France, Germany, Italy, and Spain and also, provided that the subject was sufficiently accessible, in Dutch, Finnish, and the three Scandinavian languages. Eventually even the problem of publishing key books such as Herbert Read's <span class="italic">A Concise History of Modern Painting</span> (1959) in Japanese was mastered.<br>
<br>Read's volume was part of a series, the <span class="roman">World of Art</span>, which was to be (and still is) one of the mainstays of the Thames and Hudson list. Neurath was not only the first publisher to produce art books at readily affordable prices&#151;a <span class="roman">World of Art</span> title with approximately 100 pictures in colour would, typically, cost no more than a decent biography&#151;but also the first to foresee the rise of the quality original paperback. By putting the <span class="roman">World of Art</span> into paperback form he could issue the books at prices which fitted student budgets, and the best titles in the series, such as Read's work or Michael Levey's <span class="italic">From Giotto to C&eacute;zanne</span> (1962), which had over 500 colour illustrations, went on student reading lists all over the world, in as many as twenty languages, and sold by the hundred thousand. This had as powerful an impact on international art education as Allen Lane's Penguins had in making the possession of works of literature, biography, and other genres open to all, regardless of income, a point once made appreciatively to Neurath by Lane himself.<br>
<br>On the same principles of international co-production, Neurath also published in the fields of architecture, photography, archaeology, and history. Distinguished scholars responded to his enthusiasm, to the prospect of escaping the confines of a university press, to the idea of seeing their words sensitively illustrated by staff picture researchers who had studied their own disciplines, and, above all, to having their work reach an international market not previously available to them. Neurath had a considerable persuasive gift in attracting the leading figures in their subjects and historians such as H. R. Trevor-Roper, Asa Briggs, and A. J. P. Taylor were happy to join their art-historical colleagues in these ventures. When he got Glyn Daniel, then the editor of <span class="italic">Antiquity</span>, to edit for Thames and Hudson a new series of archaeological books called <span class="roman">Ancient Peoples and Places</span>, neither could have foreseen the publication of more than 100 separate titles. And when Richard Cowell retired from the civil service, Neurath&#151;never a man to forget a favour&#151;engaged him as a consultant editor and he created a successful series of books on the classics entitled <span class="roman">Aspects of Greek and Roman Life</span>.<br>
<br>A connoisseur of art, Neurath was often the first publisher to recognize the talents of new artists, and he published the first books on painters such as Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Jackson Pollock, and many more. He also had an enviable collection of drawings by Egon Schiele and works by Oskar Kokoschka, who was a lifelong friend as well as author. He built a beautiful house, Dolphin Villa, in Tuscany&#151;the emblem of the firm is a dolphin&#151;and in London lived in a fine eighteenth-century house in Highgate village. On 26 September 1967 Neurath succumbed to cancer which he had fought heroically for many months, working to the last to ensure that the substantial business he had created would continue without him, but on the principles he had established. His widow, Eva, became chairman, his son Thomas managing director, and his daughter Constance a director. He was buried on 2 October in Highgate cemetery, not far from the grave of Karl Marx, to whom he had always granted a certain sceptical admiration.<br>
<br>Neurath was a tall, strongly built man who, with his heavy beetle brows and glasses which partially concealed intense, deep-set blue eyes, could be saturnine in repose but, when energized, became formidable, immensely charming, and indeed lovable. More or less until his death, the working day at Thames and Hudson began with all the departmental heads assembled in his office, to be confronted by their own pile of the day's post opened by the office manager, and already read by Neurath, who would comment and question all present volubly and in an English&#151;which was after all his second language&#151;that was sharply elegant and larded with telling neologisms. &#145;This book&#146;, he would proclaim of the occasional failed title, &#145;has not been published. It has been <i>pri</i>vished.&#146; Of another: &#145;It's been published to the <i>exclusion</i> of the public.&#146; A generous and supportive employer, Neurath could be quick to anger, but the explosions were soon over. He did, however, have an almost phobic inability to say &#145;Well done&#146; to a subordinate or colleague. On one occasion, when one of his staff had just pulled off a considerable commercial coup, he asked what currency had been used for the transaction. On being told that it was in sterling on the day that the Germans had just massively revalued their currency, his only comment was: &#145;What a pity you didn't do the deal in Deutschmarks.&#146; However, an hour later the employee was summoned and given an immediate rise, and a significant sum to be used to buy paintings.<br>
<br>After Neurath's death, Thames and Hudson endowed an annual Walter Neurath memorial lecture, first at Birkbeck College in the University of London and then at the National Gallery in London. The lecture is always published as an illustrated book and, for the first thirty years at least, was delivered by scholars who had been published personally by him. It was a fitting memorial to one of the many German-speaking Jewish refugees who had such a deep influence on British cultural life. Neurath was, a little shamefully perhaps, awarded no decoration in Britain, but his native Austria gave him the Goldene Ehrenzeichen (the approximate equivalent of CBE).<br>
