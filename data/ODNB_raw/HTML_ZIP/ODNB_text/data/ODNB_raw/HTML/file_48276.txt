<span class="headword">Harris,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>c.</em>1647&#150;1720), <span class="occ">publisher and bookseller</span>, was born in London, the son of William Harris, citizen and barber&#150;surgeon. Apprenticed to a bookseller on 6 April 1663, he gained his freedom from the Stationers' Company on 1 August 1670. His first known publication (with Robert Clavell), in 1673, was of the work of Particular Baptist divine Benjamin Keach, whose religious beliefs he shared. Harris continued to publish Keach's writings together with a medley of religious controversy and potboilers, including an astrological guide by William Lilly and Hannah Wolley's <span class="italic">The Accomplished Ladies Delight</span> (1675), a successful cookery book.<br>
<br>1679 marks the turning point in Harris's career. He was part of a publishing syndicate for the <span class="italic">Narrative and Impartial Discovery of the Horrid Popish Plot</span> by William Bedloe, a tract which marks his entry into the religious and political turmoil of the years 1679&#150;81. During that time he published at least a dozen pamphlet titles, including works by John Bunyan as well as ballads, a pack of playing cards depicting the Popish Plot, and anti-popish prints. In July 1679, with characteristic ingenuity and appreciation of the market, Harris was the first to exploit the new press freedom by starting a bi-weekly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Domestick Intelligence</span>, which he may also have written in collaboration with Nathaniel Crouch and Robert Claypole; his protest in 1681 that &#145;he was never the author of anything he ever published&#146; can be interpreted as a denial of single authorship made at a time when he was struggling to avoid prison. Although &#145;published to prevent false reports&#146;, the <span class="italic">Domestick Intelligence</span> was packed with anti-Catholic venom written in lively prose. Its success brought rivals, most notably Nathaniel Thompson's paper of the same name which began in August and deliberately sought to scoop Harris's readers.<br>
<br>Harris soon found himself in trouble for publishing a tract, <span class="italic">The Appeal from the Country to the City</span>, probably written by Charles Blount, which was circulating in London in October 1679. It was remarkable on two counts. First, it contained a vivid depiction of the rape and pillage associated with an imagined Catholic massacre of protestants. As if the prose was not graphic enough, two years later Harris issued <span class="italic">A Scheme of Popish Cruelties</span>, which included copperplate images closely linked to the <span class="italic">Appeal's</span> imagery. Second, the <span class="italic">Appeal</span> was unique in its open support for the succession of Charles II's illegitimate son, James Scot, duke of Monmouth, on the grounds that &#145;he who has the worst title makes the best king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Appeal</span>, 25). Throughout the autumn of 1679 Harris reported on Monmouth's exile and in 1681 he was to dedicate a work to Monmouth's son. Harris claimed he had merely republished &#145;to get money&#146; a tract that had already been running &#145;up and down the town&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 928); but it was he who &#145;bore all&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.36) when the government singled him out for prosecution. The publisher of the original copy has been a matter of dispute. Harris's enemy Nathaniel Thompson is one candidate, especially since his wife was arrested for dispersing the tract; Roger L'Estrange, the former licenser of the press, thought Langley Curtis was responsible; but it may ironically have been Harris himself who introduced the first copies, since customs officials had discovered a box of &#145;treasonable papers&#146; sent direct to Harris from Flanders. In any case, Harris was brought to trial on 5 February 1680. The prosecuting counsel, James Jeffreys, and the presiding judge, Lord Chief Justice Scroggs, refused to allow Harris to speak in his own defence and made it clear that Harris was regarded by the government as &#145;factious&#146;. The jury originally returned a verdict that he was guilty only of selling the book, prompting &#145;a very great and clamorous shout&#146; in what was evidently a packed courtroom, but Scroggs condemned Harris to imprisonment, a promise of good behaviour for three years, and a &pound;500 fine  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 929, 931). When, a week later, Harris stood in the pillory his friends and wife &#145;hollowed and whooped and would suffer nothing to be thrown at him&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.34); but although he had boasted that &#145;he had above a thousand persons who would stand by him in whatsoever he did&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 926&#150;7) he was unable to pay the fine and languished in prison. His newspaper carried on without him but ceased publication on 16 April, having shortly beforehand published an erroneous report that Lord Chief Justice North had said that the laws against absentees from church should only be enforced against the papists. Crouch tried to continue the paper with a slightly different title, prompting the imprisoned Harris to disclaim in print any responsibility for the new venture.<br>
<br>Harris petitioned the House of Commons on 19 November 1680 and the Lords on the 24th. Both houses considered his case, the peers debating whether the excessive fine contravened <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, and the Commons resolving on 22 December that king's bench had acted arbitrarily and illegally. Harris was set free (on dubious authority) and immediately published <span class="italic">The Triumph of Justice over Unjust Judges</span>, a vituperative attack on Scroggs. On 28 December he was again first in the field&#151;after a proclamation in May had silenced the periodical press&#151;in resuming his newspaper, with the express hope that &#145;it may not give offence to any, not in the least intending to meddle with any thing, that may be any ways prejudicial to State-Affairs or any private Persons, but to proceed with all Modesty and Moderation imaginable&#146;. But in January 1681 he changed its title to the <span class="italic">Protestant (Domestick) Intelligence</span>, largely to distinguish it from the Catholic Nathaniel Thompson's paper, and started another, short-lived, paper, the <span class="italic">Weekly Discoverer Strip'd Naked</span>, on 16 February 1681. Harris had now become a public butt of satire. A Catholic tract abusing the duke of Monmouth and the earl of Shaftesbury was published with Harris's imprint on it, forcing him to run to the lord mayor to disown the piece. Equally humiliating was the ridicule heaped on him, in a ballad called <span class="italic">The Protestant Cuckold</span>, for the alleged adultery of his wife, Ruth, with whom he had three children by 1681 but about whom no further details are known. Once parliament had been dissolved, privy council launched an inquiry into why Harris had been released and ordered him back into custody on 11 February 1681. His friendship with the republican Slingsby Bethel can hardly have endeared him to the government, which was also amassing evidence that Harris was one of Shaftesbury's printers. Harris's paper had also become more daring: it was accused in March 1681 of having invented one of the so-called &#145;instructions&#146; to MPs which Shaftesbury was supposed to have promoted at the general election. The paper ceased publication on 15 April 1681.<br>
<br>In June 1681, presumably as proof of good behaviour, the imprisoned Harris sent the secretary of state papers &#145;of a pernicious consequence&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 335) which had been sent to him for publication. In September he petitioned the king, protesting that he was &#145;heartily sorry&#146; for his &#145;folly&#146;, confessing that he could not pay the fine, and that when free he would give the king an account of the <span class="italic">Appeal</span>  (Muddiman, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 149). Yet it was not until November or December 1682 that he finally recovered his liberty. In March 1683 he registered his <span class="italic">Domestick Intelligence</span>, to be &#145;published gratis every Thursday for the promoting of Trade&#146;, but no copies appear to have been issued. He was nevertheless back in trouble in August 1683 when he attempted to sell seditious libels at Bristol fair. A warrant was issued for his arrest and although he escaped he was forced to lie low in disguise. He continued to promote the nonconformist cause in print but was increasingly cautious, publishing less critical pieces such as <span class="italic">Regall Power Asserted agt. Papall and Popular Userpation</span> and, in May 1684, <span class="italic">The Pious Politician</span>, a collection of the maxims of &#145;that incomparable prince&#146; Charles I. Yet, perhaps because of his earlier support for Monmouth, Harris was a figure of suspicion in 1685 when James II came to the throne, and his house was searched. Among the materials seized in November were &#145;seventy reams of a seditious book entitled <span class="italic">English Liberties</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1685</i>, 382), a radical statement of the rights of a freeborn subject written by Henry Care. Although Harris had not published the pamphlets, despite having bought the title in June 1683, and even proved to the Stationers' Company that he was already &#145;selling them for waste paper&#146;  (Myers, 209), the raid was enough to frighten him. He later claimed that his assertion of the laws and liberties of England had won him so many inveterate enemies that &#145;to save my life and family from ruin, I was compell'd to be an exile from my native country, for above eight years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Intelligence, Domestick and Foreign</span>, 1, 14 May 1695).<br>
<br>Harris went to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1686 where he resumed publishing in 1687 and, continuing a trade he appears to have entered during the succession crisis, set up the London Coffee House. He was accompanied by one of his children, Vavasour. His newspaper experience and his eye for the main chance led him to publish, on 25 September 1690, the first (and last) unlicensed issue of <span class="italic">Publick Occurrences</span>, which has been hailed as the first American newspaper. Its novelty lay partly in its intended periodical nature&#151;it was to be &#145;furnished once a moneth (or if any Glut of Occurrences happen, oftener)&#146;. But in style and content it was also revelatory. The paper promised to cover &#145;memorable occurents of divine providence&#146;, domestic and foreign public affairs so &#145;that people every where may better understand&#146; them and &#145;assist their Businesses and Negotiations&#146;, and finally to do something &#145;towards the Curing, or at least Charming of that Spirit of Lying, which prevails amongst us, wherefore nothing shall be entered, but what we have reason to believe is true&#146;. To achieve the latter aim the paper claimed it would &#145;expose the name&#146; of anyone who maliciously raised a false report. The statement of high ideals was followed by some characteristically lively reports of disasters, a suicide, and fires, but also a racy report that Louis XIV slept with his daughter-in-law and another provocative item about the failure of &#145;miserable&#146; Indian allies to deliver their promises. The governor and council of Massachusetts believed the paper contained &#145;reflections of a very high nature; as also sundry doubtful and uncertain reports&#146; and suppressed it and any other unlicensed print. The influential puritan Cotton Mather was suspected as its author, particularly since Harris's partner and printer Richard Pierce was related by marriage to him, but in a private letter Mather disowned any large hand in it, suggesting that &#145;the Publisher had not one Line of it; only as accidentally meeting him on the high-way, on his Request, I show'd him how to contract &amp; express the Report of the Expedition at Casco &amp; the East&#146;. Indeed Mather claimed the publisher &#145;pick't up here &amp; there what hee inserted&#146; and that Harris had his information from &#145;three or four &hellip; Ingenious men&#146;. Even so, Mather's support for the publication, which he regarded as &#145;a very Noble, useful and Laudable Design&#146;, was clear and he may have been right that the suppression had been aimed at him as much as at Harris  (Paltsis, 85&#150;8).<br>
<br>Harris's other claim to fame in America was his publication, again in 1690, of the often reprinted <span class="italic">New England Primer</span>. While in England, Harris had fused his protestant zeal, propagandizing genius, and an interest in the education of the young with the publication in 1679 of <span class="italic">The Protestant Tutor</span>. This has suggested to some that Harris was the author of the Boston publication. As with some of his other works the extent to which Harris was copying rather than innovating is not always clear. Even before Harris had arrived, a <span class="italic">New England Primer</span> had been published by John Griffin; but in 1685 Griffin had himself published a <span class="italic">Protestant Tutor</span> which lifted its catechism against popery and one other item from Harris's work of that name.<br>
<br>Harris prospered in Boston and in 1691 he set up a profitable partnership with John Allen, another refugee from London who had previously printed several of Increase Mather's works. In December 1692 the partners won the right to publish the Massachusetts <span class="italic">Acts and Laws</span> as printers to the governor, though they lost this the following year.<br>
<br>Harris is thought to have visited England in January 1688 and again in November 1688, but he did not finally return to London until late in 1694 or early in 1695, perhaps tempted back by the final lapse of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. Although he resumed publishing tracts, including works by Keach, he once more ventured into newspapers. On 14 May 1695 he published the <span class="italic">Intelligence, Domestick and Foreign</span>, &#145;to please and divert my older Protestant friends&#146;, changing its title in June to the <span class="italic">Pacquet-Boat from Holland</span>. But he was arrested the following month &#145;for printing false news&#146;  (Luttrell, 3.497), probably because of a misleading account of the war against France. He had more success in June 1699 when he began the <span class="italic">London Slip of News</span> which, after changing its title on the second issue to the <span class="italic">London Post</span>, continued in a whig vein until 1705. Before its closure Harris used the paper to attack his erstwhile friend John Dunton, who in happier days had described him as &#145;the most Ingenious and Innocent Companion that I had ever met with&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Errors</span>, 216&#150;17). Dunton in turn now condemned Harris as a liar: &#145;his employment, or rather livelihood, is to blast other men's credit and to steal their copies. He is a mere F&#151;y for slander, falsehood, tricking&#146;  (ibid., 466). After another unseemly tangle with the astrologer (and former fellow supporter of Monmouth) John Partridge, whose almanac he pirated, Harris was forced to close his &#145;thievish paper &hellip; for want of receivers&#146;  (ibid., 474). The quarrel with Partridge nevertheless rumbled on, for as late as 1713 Partridge observed that &#145;two or three poor printers and a bookbinder, with honest Ben&#146; would counterfeit his work  (Muddiman, <span class="italic">King's Journalist</span>, 255). As this suggests, Harris's fortunes were, and had been since the 1690s, in decline. Indeed, he spent his last years as a quack seller of Angelical Pills and other patent medicines.<br>
<br>Aside from the two sons, Vavasour and Benjamin, who were apprenticed to their father, it is possible that the publisher John Harris who began entering titles in 1685, and Sarah Harris who issued Benjamin's titles in 1688&#150;90, were also relatives. Harris died intestate, probably shortly before July 1720 when an administration order was granted to Anne, his second wife.<br>
