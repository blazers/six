<span class="headword">Lloyd <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Honeychurch]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1795&#150;1865), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist</span>, was born on 12 March 1795 in Falmouth, the younger of the two daughters of Joseph Honeychurch (1735?&#150;1818), a cooper, and his wife, Jane (1753?&#150;1803), daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth Treffry of Beerferris, Devon. Her parents were Quakers and her mother was a minister in the Society of Friends.<br>
<br>Mary's mother died when she was only eight, and a few years later her father became ill and she spent ten lonely years nursing him. After her father's death she stayed with a succession of relatives (at Camp Hill near Birmingham, Neath in Wales, and then Plymouth) before her marriage on 12 November 1823 to Samuel Lloyd (1795&#150;1862). Samuel was a member of a prominent midlands Quaker family and was head of the firm of Lloyds, Foster &amp; Co., which owned an iron foundry and a colliery at Wednesbury in Staffordshire. The couple initially lived at The Crescent, Birmingham, but soon settled in Wood Green, near Wednesbury. Mary Lloyd gave birth to nine children between 1824 and 1839, of whom one died aged only thirteen.<br>
<br>Mary Lloyd is best known as co-secretary of the first women's anti-slavery society in Britain. Women's contributions to the anti-slavery movement in Britain received little attention from historians until the late 1980s, being generally dismissed as small in scale, local in impact, and merely supportive in function, but since this date studies have demonstrated the distinctiveness and national significance of the activities of female anti-slavery societies. The Ladies Society for the Relief of Negro Slaves (later the Female Society for Birmingham [etc.] for the Relief of British Negro Slaves, then the Ladies' Negro's Friend Society) was founded on 8 April 1825 and Mary Lloyd joined her friend Lucy Townsend (<i>d</i>. 1847) as joint secretary of the new society. The society was from its foundation independent of both the national Anti-Slavery Society and of the local men's anti-slavery society, in which Mary's husband, Samuel, was involved. It acted as the hub of a developing national network of female anti-slavery societies, rather than as a local auxiliary. It also had important international connections, and, through links with Benjamin Lundy, editor of the <span class="italic">Genius of Universal Emancipation</span>, it influenced the formation of the first female anti-slavery societies in America. Under Mary Lloyd's and Lucy Townsend's leadership, the society developed the distinctive forms of female anti-slavery activity, involving an emphasis on the sufferings of women under slavery, systematic promotion of abstention from slave-grown sugar through door-to-door canvassing, and the production of innovative forms of propaganda, such as albums containing anti-slavery poems, engravings, and tracts, and work bags embroidered with anti-slavery emblems. The society was at the height of its influence during the 1823&#150;33 campaign against British colonial slavery. From 1839 it aligned itself with the newly formed British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and combined support for the universal abolition movement with support for educational work among freed slaves. The society continued to be active until 1919, at which time its secretary was Mary Lloyd's daughter Sara Wilson Sturge.<br>
<br>Mary Lloyd maintained her commitment to the anti-slavery cause until her death, acting as secretary of the society into the 1830s, and as treasurer from the 1840s to 1861, and continuing to collect funds and preside at annual meetings until her death. She was also active in many other organizations. She set up a benevolent society, a mothers' meeting, and a provident society to help the local poor, and in 1834 she and Lucy Townsend set up a Juvenile Association in Aid of Uninstructed Deaf Mutes. In 1841 she was recorded as a minister in the Society of Friends and over the next twenty years she travelled to Quaker meetings throughout the United Kingdom as well as addressing local public meetings.<br>
<br>Supported emotionally and financially by her husband, Mary Lloyd thus successfully combined raising a large family with demanding religious and philanthropic commitments requiring leadership qualities, organizational skills, and a facility for public speaking. A portrait of her in her forties shows a woman with angular facial features wearing typical Quaker attire and holding a book inscribed &#145;The Chain is broken Africa is free Aug 21st 1839&#146;. Mary Lloyd died on 25 January 1865 at Wood Green, near Wednesbury, Staffordshire, and she was buried on 1 February in Birmingham.<br>
