<span class="headword">Boyd,  William</span>  (1685&#150;1772), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, was probably a son of Thomas Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1699), Presbyterian minister of Aghadowey, co. Londonderry. He graduated MA at Edinburgh University in 1702, was licensed by the Route presbytery in 1707, and ordained at Macosquin, co. Londonderry, on 31 January 1710.<br>
<br>In March 1718 nine Presbyterian ministers, mostly from co. Londonderry, and more than three hundred of their members petitioned Colonel Samuel Shute, governor of New England, declaring their &#145;sincere and hearty inclination to transport ourselves to that very excellent and renowned Plantation, upon our obtaining from His Excellency suitable encouragement&#146;  (Bolton, 324). Boyd, deputed bearer of the petition, was favourably received in Boston. Although neither he nor any of the nine clergy themselves emigrated, James McGregor, minister of neighbouring Aghadowey (1701&#150;18), arrived with some of his flock at Boston in August 1718. They settled at Haverhill, New Hampshire, and renamed it Londonderry.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Boyd took a prominent part in the non-subscription controversy in the General Synod of Ulster. He was among the majority of ministers who voluntarily subscribed the Westminster confession of faith at synod in 1721; and in 1724 he was a member of a committee appointed to draw up articles against Thomas Nevin, minister of Downpatrick (1711&#150;44), accusing him of impugning the deity of Christ. On 25 April 1725 Boyd was installed by the Londonderry presbytery at Taughboyne, with a promised stipend of &pound;50. The congregation had been without a minister since William Gray left for Usher's Quay, Dublin, in 1721. Gray returned to the neighbourhood of Taughboyne in 1727 and, without obtaining presbytery approval, began organizing a congregation in a disused corn kiln at nearby St Johnston. Following arbitration before church courts, Gray was deposed from the ministerial office and Boyd vindicated. In 1731 synod declared &#145;that Mr. Boid's character stands clear and unexceptionable &amp; that his Doctrine and conversation has been suitable to his station &amp; office as a minister of the Gospel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the General Synod of Ulster</span>, 2.166). The St Johnston congregation was admitted to synod the same year.<br>
<br>Boyd was elected moderator of synod in 1730. At Antrim, in 1731, his sermon to synod was entitled &#145;A good conscience a necessary qualification of a gospel minister&#146;, and it was directed against a famous discourse by the non-subscribing minister of Antrim, John Abernethy, entitled <span class="italic">Religious Obedience Founded on Personal Persuasion</span>, which had been published in 1720. As an orthodox subscriber to the Westminster confession Boyd maintained that &#145;conscience is not the supreme lawgiver, the unerring witness, the infallible judge; it always bears respect unto God&#146;  (Witherow, <span class="italic">Memorials, 1731&#150;1800</span>, 4). In 1734 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the clerkship of the general synod. In 1739 he took the lead against a licentiate, Richard Aprichard, who had scruples about some doctrines in the confession and who eventually withdrew from the synod. A number of presbyteries voiced concern at the synod in 1747, complaining of &#145;sundrie Errors and corruptions creeping in upon the Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the General Synod of Ulster</span>, 2.329). Boyd and eight other divines were appointed to draw up a &#145;Serious Warning&#146; to be read from the pulpits against &#145;several dangerous errors that sap the very foundations of Christianity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the General Synod of Ulster</span>, 2.330). These errors were in regard to such doctrines as original sin, the satisfaction of Christ, the Trinity, and the authority of scripture. The warning concluded by exhorting all to continue &#145;steadfast in the faith, that has been handed down to us &hellip; contained in the sacred scriptures of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments &amp; summarily abridged in our Westminster Confession of faith, larger and shorter Catechisms&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Boyd was a constant attender at presbytery, general synod, and the sub-synod of Londonderry, where he was clerk from 1747 until 1766. He was appointed a trustee of the synod's Widows of Ministers Fund in 1761, and at that year's meeting of synod was a member of the group responsible for drawing up an address to George III. His last recorded appearance at the general synod was in 1770. Boyd married, but no details about his wife are known. He died on 2 May 1772 and was buried at Taughboyne.<br>
