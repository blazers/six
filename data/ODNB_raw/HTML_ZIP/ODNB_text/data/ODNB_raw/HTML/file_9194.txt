<span class="headword">Farrer,  Thomas Henry</span>, first Baron Farrer  (1819&#150;1899), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was the eldest of six children of Thomas Farrer (1787&#150;1833), solicitor, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and his wife, Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1867), daughter of Richard Willis of Halsnead, Lancashire. He was born at 3 Bedford Place, Russell Square, London, on 24 June 1819. His family moved in 1824 to Hampstead, joining the evangelical circle centred upon the Vale of Health. Farrer's evangelical upbringing (&#145;enough to make a boy hate Sunday for life&#146;) was reinforced in two of the three elementary schools he attended in Hampstead and Shinfield, but the most durable legacy of this education was unspiritual&#151;his mastery of Euclid, which he &#145;never entirely forgot &hellip; as I have forgotten everything learned in afterdays at Eton and Oxford&#146;  (T. C. Farrer, 12, 18). Eton's chief benefit proved to be the friendship of his two future brothers-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20328/', "Stafford Northcote")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33902/', "Arthur Hobhouse")</script>. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1836, graduating in 1840 with a second in <i>literae humaniores</i>. Failure to gain a first still weighed on him forty years later; his sister Mary remembered it as a forbidden topic in family conversation. He followed his father into the law but read for the bar, becoming, with Hobhouse, one of Roundell Palmer's first pupils at Lincoln's Inn. Called to the bar in 1844 he gained few briefs and ceased to practise in 1848. In this period Farrer developed the convictions which would guide his life. His father's death encouraged Farrer's departure from what Mary described as &#145;the narrow Evangelical lines in which we had been brought up&#146;  (T. C. Farrer, 62), under various influences including Irvingism and the study of German literature. He also shed his family's toryism: the corn law controversy was his &#145;instruction in politics&#146;. In 1847 he supported the Peelite Gladstone in the Oxford University election, his belief in free trade outweighing misgivings about Gladstone's views on church and state. During the 1850s he moved, with Gladstone, into Liberalism.<br>
<br>In 1849 Farrer was engaged, on Northcote's recommendation, to assist the Board of Trade in amending the law affecting merchant shipping, following the repeal of the navigation laws. This work led to his appointment as secretary of the new marine department of the Board of Trade in August 1850. In 1853 he became an assistant secretary of the board, handling marine business, in 1865 a full joint secretary, and in 1867 the board's first sole permanent secretary. These were years of rapid departmental growth: a staff of forty-eight in 1850 had expanded to 362 by 1886. Privately Farrer described the board as &#145;a sort of wastepaper basket into which matters are thrown which are not wanted elsewhere&#146;  (notes written <i>c</i>.1888, Farrer MSS). Its interests were indeed eclectic&#151;the regulation of railways, tramways, public utilities, weights and measures, patents, company law, and commercial treaties&#151;but expansion reflected Britain's economic growth rather than bureaucratic empire-building. Farrer shared with most of his political masters the view that government should do no more than seek to create the conditions for commerce to flourish&#151;preventing fraud, curbing monopoly, and protecting &#145;as much individual freedom as is consistent with the welfare of an organised society&#146;  (T. H. Farrer, <span class="italic">The State in its Relation to Trade</span>, 1883, 178). He exercised a considerable influence over the development of commercial law, and was made a baronet in October 1883 in recognition of his work on the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Bill</span> carried in that year.<br>
<br>As the architect of the nineteenth-century Board of Trade Farrer was, with R. W. W. Lingen at the Treasury and Godfrey Lushington at the Home Office, one of the pillars of the mid-Victorian civil service. He considered the civil service &#145;a capital career for one who prefers power to fame&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Oct 1899), and although the work of a bureaucrat in a minimalist state inevitably left few monuments, his influence over policy was substantial. &#145;He does not know the real political history of our time&#146;, wrote Sir James MacDonnell on Farrer's death, &#145;who does not know the unseen and silent influence of Sir Thomas Farrer in the seventies and early in the eighties&#146;  (ibid.), referring to the years in which Britain resisted the European protectionist tide. Farrer himself none the less thought this a losing battle: &#145;When we of this generation are dead and gone&#146;, he wrote in the early 1880s, &#145;there will be the fight that was won by Peel and Cobden to fight over again&#146;  (T. H. Farrer to T. C. Farrer, 27 May 1881, Farrer MSS). He feared &#145;another dose of a Tory Ministry&#146; and his retirement in May 1886 coincided with the end of the Liberals' years of dominance.<br>
<br>Retirement unleashed a vigorous polemicist. After 1886 Farrer produced pamphlets and books attacking the quasi-protective sugar convention in 1889, criticizing the policies of G. J. Goschen as chancellor of the exchequer, denouncing imperial federation, and justifying the gold standard (he helped found the Gold Standard Defence Association in 1895). Above all he sought to defend free trade from its increasingly numerous critics. He considered it as much an ethical as a commercial principle, which &#145;reconciles self-interest with morality&#151;our duty to ourselves with our duty to our neighbour&#146;, bringing &#145;the nations a little nearer to the distant ideal of the Christian moralist&#146;  (T. H. Farrer, <span class="italic">Free Trade versus Fair Trade</span>, 1882, 138). Judged purely as an economic thinker he was unoriginal. His obituarist, MacDonnell, acknowledged &#145;perhaps a lack of subtlety &hellip; a premature pause in intellectual development&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Oct 1899), and Farrer himself saw the defence of the principles of liberal economics as a restatement of the self-evident: &#145;as if I had been asked to prove Euclid, or give a reason for the rules of Grammar&#146;  (T. H. Farrer, <span class="italic">Free Trade versus Fair Trade</span>, 1882, 1). His writings are largely rehearsals of the &#145;rules&#146; of classical economics.<br>
<br>A brief career in local politics followed retirement. Denied election to the Surrey county council in 1889, Farrer was chosen as an alderman by the Progressive (Liberal) majority on the London county council, becoming vice-chairman in 1890. Drawing upon his Board of Trade experience, he guided the council's attempts to control London's private water companies, but he disagreed strongly with the council's labour policy, which he considered unduly favourable to the trade unions. His 1892 memorandum entitled <span class="italic">The London County Council's Labour Bill, Market Rate or Fancy Rate</span> was one of his most forceful and least effective writings. He played little part on the council after ceasing to be vice-chairman in 1892, although he remained an alderman until 1898. Farrer remained hostile to toryism, which he identified with protection and jingoism (on the outbreak of the South African War he donated &pound;100 to the Manchester Peace Society), but became increasingly perturbed by the &#145;democratic&#146; tone of modern Liberalism and the threat to economic liberty from &#145;the impatient action of philanthropy&#146;. He would not have disputed the contemporary view of him in his last years as &#145;the only surviving unimpaired specimen of the Manchester School&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Oct 1899). In June 1893 he was created Baron Farrer of Abinger.<br>
<br>Farrer married Frances, daughter of William Erskine of the Indian Civil Service, in 1854. She died in 1870, leaving three sons and one daughter. In 1873 he married Katherine Euphemia (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28965/', "Hensleigh Wedgwood")</script>. Farrer died on 12 October 1899 at Abinger Hall, the house near Dorking designed for him by Alfred Waterhouse, and was cremated at Woking crematorium, his ashes being placed in the family grave at Brookwood cemetery on 15 October. The title passed to his son from his first marriage, Thomas Cecil Farrer (1859&#150;1940) who was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107094/', "Frances Farrer")</script>, general secretary of the National Federation of Women's Institutes.<br>
