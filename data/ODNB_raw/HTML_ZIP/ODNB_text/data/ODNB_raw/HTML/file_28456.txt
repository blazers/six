<span class="headword">Wales,  James</span>  (1747&#150;1795), <span class="occ">portrait painter and archaeological draughtsman</span>, was born in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire. He moved early in his life to Aberdeen, where he was educated at Marischal College. It was there that he also began painting modest portraits on tin plates. Apparently self-taught, Wales benefited from the early patronage of Francis Peacock in Aberdeen. By 1783 Wales had moved to London, where he exhibited two portraits at the Society of Artists, with the catalogue recording his address as Little St Martin's Lane. Wales exhibited one more portrait at the Society of Artists in 1791 and three paintings at the Royal Academy between 1788 and 1789, but stiff competition encouraged him to seek employment in India. He applied to the East India Company for permission to work in Bombay in 1790, was granted permission on 5 January 1791, and arrived in Bombay on 15 July of the same year. Wales left his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1795), and their daughters in Hampstead, Middlesex, although he soon encouraged them to go to Bombay after learning of his six-year-old daughter's death in 1792. Wales's family arrived in India some time in 1793, but Margaret died in childbirth in May 1795, leaving the artist to provide for five daughters.<br>
<br>While Bombay was a smaller and less affluent market than Calcutta or Madras for a British painter, Wales was fortunate enough to meet Sir Charles Warre Malet, the resident at the Maratha court in Poona from 1786 to 1797. In addition to painting portraits for Malet, Wales painted a number of remarkable portraits of the Maratha chiefs and their ministers. The most impressive surviving example is a group portrait, <span class="italic">Madhu Rao Narayan, the Maratha peshwa with Nana Fadnavis and Attendants</span> (1792; Royal Asiatic Society, London). Unfortunately, the subsequent Anglo-Maratha wars of 1803&#150;5 and 1817&#150;18 encouraged the destruction of many of Wales's Indian portraits.<br>
<br>In March 1793 Wales met the artists Thomas and William Daniell, who encouraged him to continue his detailed drawings of Indian caves and temples. On a 1795 drawing expedition to the Kanheri caves, Wales became ill and was carried back to Bombay, where he died on 18 November. The majority of Wales's work would have been lost or forgotten had it not been for the diligence of his friend and patron Charles Warre Malet. On 16 September 1799 Malet married Wales's eldest daughter, Susanna, in England, and in 1800 he published twelve of Wales's views of Bombay. Wales's most ambitious undertaking was a series of studies begun in 1792 for a history painting depicting Malet's negotiations for a British treaty with the Marathas. Malet made these studies available to Thomas Daniell, who exhibited the finished work at the Royal Academy in 1805 under the title <span class="italic">Sir C. Malet, bart., the British resident at Poonah, in the year 1790 concluding a treaty in the durbar with Souae Madarow the peshwa or prince of the Mahratta empire</span> (priv. coll.). A collection of Wales's drawings is in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
