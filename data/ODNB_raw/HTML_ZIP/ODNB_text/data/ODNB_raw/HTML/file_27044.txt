<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Water Poet]</span>  (1578&#150;1653), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in the parish of St Ewen's, Gloucester, on 24 August 1578. His parents are unknown, though a stray comment he made many years later suggests that his father was a barber&#150;surgeon. The family was prosperous enough for Taylor to be sent to an elementary school in Gloucester and then on to a grammar school, perhaps the Crypt School, but he found Latin grammar impenetrable and soon left. In the early 1590s he moved to London, and was apprenticed to a waterman, probably in Southwark. He became a proud Londoner; his life was to be bound up with the watermen's affairs for the next fifty years, and in publications he styled himself &#145;John Taylor the Water-poet&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>There are only fleeting glimpses of Taylor's early years in the capital. The Watermen's Company supplied men for the navy in times of war, and Taylor later boasted of having served Elizabeth at sea on seven occasions. He took part in 1596 in the expedition to Cadiz led by Essex and Lord Howard of Effingham, and sailed in the <i>Rainbow</i> on the voyage to the Azores in 1597. On one occasion, he later recalled, he and some friends went ashore to explore the small island of Flores, and were stranded for five days without food by bad weather. Taylor also hints at an early visit to Ostend, possibly during the siege of 1601&#150;4. After completing his apprenticeship, about 1597, Taylor plied his trade as a waterman. He also married at some point before 1612; his wife's identity is unknown, though her first name was probably Abigail and her maiden name possibly Miles. The couple settled on the Bankside in Southwark, and remained there until 1643. About 1605 Taylor was appointed &#145;bottleman&#146; at the Tower, under its lieutenant, Sir William Waad. The post involved rowing out to ships bringing in cargoes of wine, and demanding two large bottles as a perquisite due to the lieutenant. Taylor served very happily until Waad was removed from office in 1613 and his successors demanded large fees for Taylor's continuation in office. He was eventually turned out on refusing to pay a further exorbitant increase, but was so stung by rumours that he had been sacked for dishonesty that he bought it back in 1616 for an annual fee of &pound;72, which, rather perversely, he recouped by selling some of the wines collected for the lieutenant for his own profit. Late in 1617 a rival offered a higher bid for the post, and Taylor was ousted again, this time for ever. In <span class="italic">Taylors Farewell to the Tower Bottles</span> (1622) he presented an account of his experience.<br>
<br>Native wit, an affable personality, and good manners made Taylor stand out from the start among the rough breed of Thames watermen, and attracted the notice of some of the courtiers he ferried. In 1613 he was recommended by Viscount Haddington to be one of the King's Watermen, a select and liveried group who served the crown on ceremonial occasions. He also became a spokesman for the Watermen's Company on official business, and in 1614 was chosen to press its suit to the king against the new theatres erected north of the river. The watermen had enjoyed a huge trade ferrying visitors to the Globe and other theatres on the Bankside, and the move to the northern suburbs was a serious blow. Despite sympathetic words from Francis Bacon and Somerset, the king's favourite, nothing was achieved.<br>
<br>Taylor's links with the Bankside theatres included actors, writers, and spectators with court connections. These contacts, and those he made through his post at the Tower, triggered a new interest in books and learning. He began to read voraciously, and before long started to write himself. In 1612 he brought his verses together and published them as <span class="italic">The Sculler, Rowing from Tiber to Thames</span>, with a simple woodcut of the author rowing his boat and a Latin version of the waterman's cry as an epigram. The title-page encapsulated the strategy he was to pursue throughout his literary career, playing on the novelty and incongruity of a lowly waterman aspiring to poetry and rubbing shoulders with men of letters and power. There were complimentary verses by Samuel Rowlands and Nicholas Breton, and though Ben Jonson offered nothing, Taylor pointedly claimed Jonson as a dear friend.<br>
<br>One of Taylor's verses made a derisive reference to the humorous writer and traveller Thomas Coryate, and this sparked a heated pamphlet war which he relished as a further opportunity for self-publicity. Both Coryate and Taylor petitioned the king, and one of Taylor's pamphlets was ordered to be burnt by the public hangman, providing still more publicity. In 1614 he became embroiled in conflict with another writer and entertainer, William Fennor. They arranged a joint appearance at the Hope theatre to stage a contest by performing dramatic impressions of contemporary characters. Taylor's flair for publicity ensured that the theatre was full, and Fennor's failure to turn up left him facing a near riot by his audience. He published a damning account as <span class="italic">Taylors Revenge</span> (1614), and though Fennor replied, Taylor fired a second salvo and claimed victory.<br>
<br>During these years Taylor was also busy turning out publications of many other kinds. There were verses on the death of Prince Henry in 1612, and the marriage of Princess Elizabeth the following year. A miniature &#145;thumb-bible&#146;, a verse summary of scripture published in 64mo, appeared as a toy for courtiers in 1614, with a dedication to the queen and Prince Charles. A similar version of John Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span> appeared the following year. <span class="italic">The Nipping and Snipping of Abuses</span> (1614) offered satirical comments on the manners and vices of the age, while <span class="italic">Taylors Urania</span> (1615) presented his religious reflections in verse. He published verse essays, mock encomia, and nonsense writings too. His influences, as diverse as the genres, included Thomas Nashe, George Wither, and Thomas Heywood, while he also expressed his admiration for Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, and Jonson. He could number many of the writers of the age among his friends and acquaintances, among them Samuel Daniel, Thomas Dekker, Breton, Rowlands, Philemon Holland, Heywood, and Wither.<h2>
<a name="Travelsandadventures"></a>Travels and adventures</h2>Taylor was to continue producing verse throughout his life. He never achieved the recognition or material rewards he felt he deserved, notwithstanding his frequent self-deprecating allusions to his modest talents and lack of education. Many better and better-connected writers found it equally hard to make a living by their pens, or to win substantial patronage. Taylor had an unusually entrepreneurial spirit, however, and found his own solution, by promoting his image as a &#145;personality&#146; and turning it to financial account. His greatest success lay in designing a series of exotic journeys, publicizing them in advance, and persuading large numbers of acquaintances to sponsor him in return for a copy of a published account of his adventures following his return. The destination was usually of little importance; the point lay in the mode of travel, and the mock-heroic account of his adventures on the way. There were several models for such ventures, including Coryate and Will Kempe, but none matched Taylor in the publicity they achieved or the rewards they obtained. The first of these journeys was to Hamburg, in the summer of 1617, which Taylor used to publish a jocularly xenophobic account of German customs and society, in the popular style of the grotesque. The adventure was sufficiently successful to encourage Taylor to plan more adventurous schemes.<br>
<br>Taylor's next, and most successful, adventure was described in <span class="italic">The Pennyles Pilgrimage</span> (1618), an account of his visit to Scotland in the summer and early autumn that year. He travelled on foot, pledging to take no money, and not to beg any food, drink, or lodging on the way, a handicap sufficient to persuade 1650 sponsors (among them Edward Alleyn the actor&#150;manager) to pledge to pay for an account of his adventures if he survived to publish them. Given his huge circle of acquaintances and invincible bonhomie, Taylor was unlikely to die of starvation. Friends old and new provided him with food and shelter, and the later stages of his journey to Edinburgh took on something of the character of a progress. He enjoyed the sights of Edinburgh, and later joined the earl of Mar on a lavish hunting party in the highlands at Braemar. Some alleged that Taylor's visit was designed to parody or steal the thunder from Ben Jonson's own trip to Scotland that year, a charge he repudiated; he paid a friendly call on Jonson at Leith on 25 September before returning to London. By now a consummate showman, he orchestrated his return to London in impressive style, arranging a grand supper for his friends at Islington, with entertainment by the earl of Derby's players, who performed &#145;The life and death of Guy of Warwick&#146;&#151;a jocular device, perhaps, to celebrate a new &#145;hero&#146; by recalling the adventures of an old one. Taylor's humorous account of his travels was finished within a fortnight of his return, and published with a dedication to Buckingham, the king's new favourite.<br>
<br>Several further &#145;travels&#146; followed in quick succession. The first and most bizarre was in July 1619, when Taylor and a friend sailed down the Thames to Quinborough in a boat he had fashioned, for a wager, out of brown paper, kept half afloat by inflated animal bladders attached to the sides. In August 1620 he set out on a much longer and less frivolous journey, to Prague. Taylor was a fervent protestant and patriot, and deeply disturbed by news of the Catholic Habsburg armies massing to crush the Bohemian revolt and drive out the new king, Frederick, and his British wife, Elizabeth. He had welcomed the marriage of Frederick and Elizabeth in 1613 as an important building block in an anti-Habsburg alliance, and was appalled that Frederick's election to the Bohemian crown was now under threat. In <span class="italic">An English-Mans Love to Bohemia</span> (1620) he urged English readers to enlist in the volunteer forces being raised to defend the Bohemian protestants, offering stirring reminders of English heroism in earlier campaigns from Cr&eacute;cy to the Armada. His journey to Prague, which he began on 4 August 1620, was designed to boost public interest further and feed the huge appetite for fresh and reliable news. Taylor can be plausibly seen as a forerunner of the modern war correspondent. He and his friend Tilbury Strange travelled via Amsterdam and Leipzig, joined along the way by his brother, who lived at B&uuml;ckeburg, the seat of Count Ernst von Schomberg, and may have been able to act as interpreter. They found a warm welcome at the royal court in Prague, where they remained for several weeks before returning in an epic boat-trip 600 miles down the Elbe to Hamburg. Taylor's published account had to tread carefully in handling the political issues, but its partisan spirit would have been obvious to all. The battle of the White Mountain crushed the Bohemian revolt only a few weeks after Taylor's return, however, and signalled the collapse of his dreams. Some of the short pamphlets he published in the last years of James's reign made it clear that he was dismayed by the government's failure to intervene in the continental struggle, and that he shared the national relief at Prince Charles's safe return from his quixotic mission to Spain in search of a royal, Catholic bride.<br>
<br>The next two journeys were ambitious &#145;voyages&#146; in a waterman's wherry. In July 1622 Taylor and some friends rowed a wherry down the Thames into the North Sea, and then along the east coast to the Humber, and so to York. At Hull he was f&ecirc;ted by the mayor, and at Cawood he dined with Toby Matthew, the archbishop of York, though to his chagrin the mayor of York declined to buy the battered wherry as a souvenir. In July 1623 he set off on a similar &#145;voyage&#146; to Salisbury, through the English Channel and up the Wiltshire Avon. This trip capitalized on the king's own recent progress to the west, and had the more serious goal of promoting a scheme to investigate whether Salisbury's struggling economy could be rescued by making the Avon navigable to the sea. In the event Taylor and his companions were lucky to survive, for their boat was repeatedly battered by high seas and came close to foundering; when they were driven ashore one day their misery was compounded by a suspicious constable who thought they were pirates and tried to detain them. There were compensations too, however; at Portsmouth they were welcomed aboard the flagship of the fleet waiting to fetch Prince Charles home from Spain, and during his stay at Salisbury, Taylor found an opportunity to go sightseeing at Wilton House, seat of the earls of Pembroke. But despite the jocular tone of his published narrative, Taylor was so chastened by his narrow escape from drowning that he never again went to sea in a small boat.<h2>
<a name="Themiddleyears"></a>The middle years</h2>The more sober court of Charles I was a less auspicious milieu for comic eccentrics, and from choice or necessity Taylor now began to present himself in a slightly more dignified manner. In 1625 he was among the royal watermen to escort the new queen, Henrietta Maria, to Oxford to escape the plague; he occupied lodgings in Oriel College during the court's residence there, and wrote a vivid pamphlet on the epidemic. In 1630 he published his collected <span class="italic">Workes</span>, an extraordinary decision for a popular rhymer who was placing himself in the company of Shakespeare, Jonson, and Daniel (a friend). It was an act of defiance and self-assertion, however, rather than triumph or celebration. Taylor had no grand patrons, and pointedly dedicated his volume to &#145;the world&#146;, with dispirited comments on his failure to win recognition. It is typical that the same year that saw this bid for literary respectability also saw him devising a project to bring Nicholas Wood, &#145;the Great Eater of Kent&#146;, to London and turn his gargantuan appetite into a money-raising venture by holding public &#145;performances&#146; at the Bear Garden.<br>
<br>For much of the ensuing decade Taylor was employed on official business. In 1631 he accompanied an expedition sponsored by the crown to survey the upper Thames, from Staines to Oxford, and report on the obstacles to navigation and opportunities for improvement. This was a project close to his heart, and he published an account of his personal observations on the trip, noting hazards and the appropriate remedies. During the 1630s he was frequently preoccupied with the affairs of the Watermen's Company, one of the largest and most turbulent of the city's companies. He served as one of its rulers, or overseers, in 1630&#150;32 and again in 1638&#150;40, and later as its clerk. Probably the most polished and well-connected of the ruling group, he was the obvious choice to lead the company's campaign to defend the watermen against competition from the hackney coaches, which were stealing much of their trade. From April 1634 Taylor was busy pleading their cause to government officials, and his efforts bore some fruit in a royal proclamation in January 1636 which banned hackney coachmen from carrying fares on journeys of under 3 miles. This fell short of the watermen's aspirations, however, and deepened the resentment and distrust of rank-and-file watermen which was to explode only a few years later.<br>
<br>Taylor's literary output during the 1630s was more journalistic than in earlier years. One of his most successful pieces was a humorous verse-biography of the centenarian Thomas Parr, who was brought to London in 1635 as a prodigy at the alleged age of 152; Taylor's account passed through three quick editions and was reprinted at Amsterdam in a Flemish translation. Other offerings included two consumers' guides to taverns in London and the home counties, a characteristic combination of business and pleasure, and <span class="italic">The Carrier's Cosmographie</span> (1637), a valuable handbook which set out information on the times and departure points of carriers and wagons leaving London for destinations in the provinces, and similar information on packet-boats. In 1639 Taylor took advantage of one of the periodic revivals of the &#145;woman question&#146;, which his friend Heywood had stirred up once more, and published two jocularly misogynist collections (<span class="italic">Divers Crab-Tree Lectures</span>, 1639, and <span class="italic">A Juniper Lecture</span>, 1640). They were quickly followed by a spirited and sometimes perceptive counterblast giving the woman's view, <span class="italic">The Womens Sharpe Revenge</span> (1640), which was published anonymously but bears clear signs of Taylor's own hand. At the very end of the decade Taylor revived his old practice of making a summer jaunt to the provinces. In July 1639 he embarked on a lengthy and convivial tour of the midlands, East Anglia, and Yorkshire, travelling this time by horse. Following his return to London in September he published an account which gave no hint of the gathering storm clouds.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwars"></a>The civil wars</h2>The collapse of Charles I's personal rule marked a decisive turning point in Taylor's life as well as in the affairs of the country. He played a characteristically combative role in the upheavals that followed. There were some aspects of the new order he could welcome in the months after parliament met in November 1640. He rejoiced at the attack on monopolies with a powerful broadside, <span class="italic">The Complaint of M Tenter-Hooke</span> (1641), illustrated with a woodcut of a monster whose fierce claws and grotesque costume showed how the consumer had been exploited and devoured by greedy monopolists. Taylor also praised the crackdown on Catholics, and identified parliament and the Scots as crucial defences against the threat of popery. He readily took the protestation (against Catholicism) twice. But in most respects the new order appalled him. In <span class="italic">Differing Worships</span> (1640), written before the Short Parliament met, he mounted a strong defence of the established church, including controversial practices such as bowing at the name of Jesus, against presbyterian and separatist critics. As a traditionalist, Taylor had always strongly disliked religious radicals, and he was deeply alarmed by their new prominence and confidence. When rioters smashed the altar-rails which had long stood in St Saviour's, Southwark, his parish church, in June 1641 he joined in petitioning the House of Lords, successfully, for their arrest and punishment. He is also found interrupting a radical preacher at Rotherhithe. More importantly, he poured out a flood of polemical pamphlets, some of them appearing anonymously, defending the episcopal church, lamenting that the prayer book was being abandoned in parish worship, and ridiculing the radicals. <span class="italic">A Swarme of Sectaries</span> (1641) sparked a ferocious and obscene pamphlet war with the parliamentarian preacher Henry Walker, which continued into 1642, and included an inspired burlesque sermon published as <span class="italic">A Seasonable Lecture</span> (1642), soon famous as &#145;Toby's Dog&#146;.<br>
<br>The political upheavals also triggered a crisis in the Watermen's Company. Like many other London companies it faced strong pressure for reform from rank-and-file members who accused the ruling oligarchy of corruption and demanded a more democratic system in which the &#145;rulers&#146; would be directly elected by every waterman. The ruling group viewed this demand as anarchic, and sought to tighten its own grip. In March 1641 the two sides presented rival petitions to parliament, and in May a Commons committee considering a bill to strengthen the overseers' authority was ordered to consider the radicals' complaints too. Taylor was one of the inner circle now accused of corruption, and he played a leading role in the bitter and sometimes violent exchanges. When the reformers changed tactics and took their case to the mayor and aldermen in February 1642, it was Taylor who was chosen to present the overseers' case. The eventual outcome, perhaps inevitably, favoured the reformers. A new system of choosing officers was introduced, though based on indirect rather than direct elections, and the company's elections in March 1642 swept away the old guard. It was the end of Taylor's association with the company, which had lasted over half a century.<br>
<br>Taylor continued to cling on to other aspects of his old life for as long as he was able. In the summer of 1641 he had made another of his epic wherry-voyages, sailing up the Thames as far as Cirencester, carting the boat across to a tributary of the Severn, and then navigating the Severn, Avon, and Wye. The voyage lasted twenty days, during which he calculated his party had rowed and sailed 1200 miles. The published narrative offered a familiar blend of humorous anecdote and passionate advocacy for the cause of inland navigation, including the value of a canal to link the Thames and Severn river systems, and detailed assessments of the problems and opportunities for commercial traffic on each of the rivers they had explored.<br>
<br>The king's enforced flight from London early in 1642 filled Taylor with dismay, and the ensuing slide to civil war left him in a highly exposed position. His devotion to the crown and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> was widely known, and no one doubted where his allegiance lay. But he was too old to fight and lacked the means to retire to a place of safety. In November 1642 he was arrested and interrogated by the radical MP Miles Corbet and the lord mayor over seditious remarks he was alleged to have made about the five members. In December he called for a compromise between royal prerogative and parliamentary privilege that would restore peace and enable the two parties to unite to crush the Irish uprising. But committed parliamentarians saw Taylor as an enemy, and rumours of death threats crystallized in an alarming attack by a mob while he was drinking in a tavern near the Guildhall, when he was lucky to escape with his life. He faced new dangers after refusing to pay a parliamentary tax early in 1643, and decided that flight was his only remaining option. Taking a boat to Windsor, where some parliamentary soldiers recognized him and accused him of planning treachery, he made his way on foot to Henley and arrived safely at Abingdon, in royalist territory, after a series of adventures. From there he made his way to Oxford, where the king gave him a friendly welcome and, more important, a livelihood. Taylor was appointed a yeoman of the guard and joint water bailiff, with responsibility for taking up boats to transport ammunition and supplies, and for keeping the waterways clear. His wife, whom he had been forced to leave behind in Southwark, died shortly after his departure, and can probably be identified with the Abigail Taylor buried at St Saviour's, Southwark, on 18 September 1643. Their modest estate was seized by parliament.<br>
<br>Taylor's most important contribution to the royalist cause lay in the stream of political squibs he produced during his time in Oxford. Polemical and satirical, they were designed to boost morale rather than convince the uncommitted, and the tone was jaunty and confident. Taylor was more concerned to establish appropriate images for the king and his enemies than plunge into the details of the issues at stake, largely beyond him and many of his readers. He presented the king's war as a defensive struggle, with Charles a good protestant upholding the established church and his traditional prerogatives against hypocritical and aggressive parliamentary enemies. According to the parliamentarian John Booker, Taylor also collaborated with George Wharton and John Berkenhead on the royalist newspaper, <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>. He remained in Oxford until its surrender in July 1646. Under the terms of surrender, the king's former household servants were allowed to apply for a competent allowance from the committee for the king's revenue, and Taylor became a zealous campaigner on his own and their behalf, forwarding some two hundred petitions to the committee. But it was no secret that he had been a political activist rather than a mere household attendant, and he can hardly have been surprised that he was awarded nothing.<h2>
<a name="Thelastyears"></a>The last years</h2>Taylor's final years were spent in poverty. There was no longer a royal court, the Watermen's Company was in the hands of his enemies, and most likely patrons were living in poverty or exile. Taylor settled in Westminster, and by 1647 was running the Crown alehouse near Covent Garden. About 1647 he married again, though his wife's identity is unknown except that her first name was Alice. After the king's death he changed the alehouse's name to the Mourning Crown, and then, when this aroused disapproval, to the Poet's Head, with a sign bearing his own portrait.<br>
<br>As the alehouse afforded only a modest living, Taylor continued to supplement it by his pen. He never abandoned his support for the royalist cause, though circumstances now obliged him to support it with more circumspection. When the king was held captive in the Isle of Wight in 1648, Taylor decided to visit him, acknowledging frankly that he was moved by the need to make money as well as by a genuine longing to see his sovereign once more. His published account of the visit mixed comedy and pathos, describing his misadventures on the road before going on to stress the king's unshakeable piety and patience, and the miraculous cures he had wrought on the island by the royal touch. Although Taylor was still clinging to hopes of a settlement, his portrayal of the king was already that of a royal martyr. In the books of nonsense he published in his last years, he made it clear that the absurdly fractured language and jumble of ideas and images were intended to reflect the madness of the age.<br>
<br>In his last few years Taylor made four more of his traditional travels, designed to relieve his poverty. For his journey to the west in the summer of 1649 he found almost 3000 subscribers, testimony to his remarkable enduring popularity as well as his energy. He wrote a vivid account of the war-torn land he passed through on a long and sometimes dangerous journey that took him all the way to Land's End, where he carved his name on the shore. The journey brought him little profit, however, for on 15 August, shortly after his return, he was arrested on suspicion of espionage, and his papers were seized. Among them were the names and addresses of his sponsors, and their loss dealt a crippling blow to his marketing plans.<br>
<br>Despite this setback Taylor made another journey in the summer of 1650, this time sailing to Ipswich, travelling through East Anglia, and returning via Cambridge. This was a less demanding expedition, and he enjoyed the warm welcome he found from Sir William Paston at Oxnead and many other hosts. The Scottish invasion of 1651 ruled out any travels that year, but in 1652 Taylor embarked on an ambitious journey that took him to Chester and then on a tour round the Welsh coast. He was greeted warmly by the cavalier gentry, but viewed with suspicion by the parliamentary garrisons, and was afraid of being arrested as a spy once more. The summer of 1653 saw his final journey: a much shorter trip to Sussex, where he enjoyed the rich food and drink lavished on him by his various hosts.<br>
<br>Taylor's later pamphlets contain numerous references to his failing health, and he did not long survive this last journey. He was buried on 5 December 1653 in St Martin-in-the-Fields. His widow, Alice, died in January 1658.<br>
<br>Like most writers, Taylor never achieved the recognition he thought his due. Having successfully constructed a comic persona as the rhyming waterman, it was an impossible challenge to be accepted as a serious poet. His achievement was none the less impressive. As a literary entrepreneur and showman he was far more prosperous in his heyday than most writers; few watermen or struggling poets were also subsidy men or had to pay ship money. Taylor pursued a successful literary career for over fifty years, demonstrating a remarkable range, facility, and inventiveness. He played a pioneering role in the development of nonsense verse, popular political journalism, and travel writing. His travel pamphlets offer a distinctive veneration for antiquity combined with a ringing endorsement of innovation: he admired the public amenities of well-ordered towns, and championed signs of economic progress, whether manifested by coal mines or developments in inland navigation. Taylor anticipated Daniel Defoe more than he echoed John Leland. The travel writings, like almost everything he published in both verse and prose, had a strongly autobiographical dimension, and they provide a vivid picture of a bluff, shrewd, convivial man, with an appetite for life that won him friends across the political spectrum. William Winstanley and Anthony Wood paid tribute to his natural gifts as a writer. The portrait in Watermen's Hall and those contained in his publications reinforce the surviving pen portraits from Taylor himself and his friends.<br>
