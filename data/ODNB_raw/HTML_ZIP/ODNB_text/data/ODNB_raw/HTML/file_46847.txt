<span class="headword">Courtauld,  Samuel</span>  (1793&#150;1881), <span class="occ">silk manufacturer</span>, was born in Albany, New York, USA, on 1 June 1793, the eldest son of George Courtauld (1761&#150;1823) and Ruth, daughter of Stephen Minton of Cork. The Courtaulds had come to England as Huguenot refugees at the end of the seventeenth century where for three generations they worked and prospered as silversmiths in London. George Courtauld was apprenticed to a Spitalfields silk weaver in 1775 and set up as a silk throwster. In 1785, however, he made the first of a number of trips to America where, in 1789, he married Ruth Minton. Shortly after Samuel's birth his parents returned to England and to the silk industry. For some years Samuel worked for his father, who had become an ardent Unitarian with politically radical sympathies, but who proved to be a remarkably incompetent businessman. By 1816 his position, and that of his family, was financially perilous. In that year, the ambitious Samuel, intent upon rescuing the family and restoring it to what he saw as its rightful social position, set up in business on his own account as a silk throwster in a small mill at Bocking, Essex. His father went back to America, where he died in 1823.<br>
<br>The family returned to England and became dependent upon Samuel Courtauld's success. After acquiring the lease of a larger water-powered mill at Bocking, he then converted an old corn mill in the neighbouring town of Halstead. In 1828 he established a long-enduring partnership with his younger brother George (1802&#150;1861) and with his cousin and brother-in-law, Peter Alfred Taylor. In 1822 Courtauld had married Taylor's sister Ellen (1801&#150;1872), daughter of William Taylor and Catherine Courtauld. This quintessentially family firm, by that time known as Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co., then began a period of striking success. To silk throwing was added hand-loom weaving and, about 1830, the first foundation of the family's real wealth: the power-loom weaving, dyeing, and finishing of black silk mourning crape. A remarkable boom in black crape developed in Victorian England as the ancient ritual of mourning was formalized, publicized, and commercialized. Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co. did very well out of it, becoming the country's biggest manufacturer of mourning crape. Until crape began to fall from fashion in the 1880s, the partners were regularly earning well over 30 per cent on their capital. During the last decade of his life Samuel, as the senior partner, was drawing an income from the business alone of about &pound;46,000 per annum.<br>
<br>The partnership retained its family character as a new generation of Courtaulds and Taylors, together with members of related Unitarian families, came into the business after the mid-century. But family and firm alike were totally dominated by Samuel Courtauld. His prime contribution to the business consisted of his organizing ability and his driving ambition, allied to a shrewd practical intelligence and an immense capacity for hard work. A difficult colleague, his letters often reveal paranoid tendencies as he fluctuated between euphoria and highly autocratic behaviour on the one hand, and gloom and self-deprecation on the other. His attitude to his workers (over 3000 were employed by the firm in the 1880s) was characteristic of the day: a benevolent despotism informed by a profound belief in the merits of free enterprise; a concern to instil &#145;orderly and industrious habits&#146; among the working poor by a system of fines and rewards; and a ruthless determination to stamp out incipient strikes or other symptoms of insubordination. The partners, aided by their wives, pursued an active local welfare policy, building workers' cottages, a coffee house, and a reading-room. In his younger days Samuel Courtauld had taken some part in local radical activities; and he later played an important role in the celebrated Braintree church rates case, which led ultimately to the abolition of church rates and was a notable victory for the principle of religious freedom. But his other attempts at political involvement bore little fruit. Stiff and domineering in manner, yet sensitive to insult, he lacked the resilience necessary for politics. As <span class="italic">The Times</span> observed in its obituary, &#145;had the death of Mr. Courtauld happened some 30 or 40 years ago a popular hero would have passed away&#146; but he lived on &#145;to be almost forgotten&#146;  (24 March 1881, 10e).<br>
<br>In 1854 Courtauld bought the substantial mansion of Gosfield Hall, between Halstead and Bocking, in Essex, with 2000 acres, an estate augmented by further purchases. He had a London house and a yacht. At his death, on 21 March 1881, at Gosfield Hall, he was worth about &pound;700,000. His wife had died in 1872; their only child died in infancy. Apart from legacies of between &pound;30,000 and &pound;35,000 apiece to two nephews, and sundry lesser bequests, he left the bulk of his estate to two adopted children.<br>
