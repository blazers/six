</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Long,  Charles</span>, Baron Farnborough  (1760&#150;1838), <span class="occ">politician and connoisseur of the arts</span>, was born in the City of London in January 1760, the fourth son of Beeston Long, the head of a well-known firm of West Indies merchants in the City. A senior branch of the family, established at Hurts Hall in Suffolk, had owned an estate in Jamaica since the conquest of the island in 1665. His mother, Sarah, was the daughter of Abraham Crop, another wealthy City merchant. Long was educated at a private school in Greenwich and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1779, but is not known to have taken a degree. Simultaneously he was entered at the Inner Temple, where he had chambers in Tanfield Court. From 1786 to 1788 he made the grand tour, exploring Rome under the tutelage of James Byres, and laying the foundation of his art collection.<br>
<br>Long's involvement in politics as a friend and ally of William Pitt, whom he had met at Cambridge, is attested as early as 1788, when he was canvassing for Lord Hood, the ministerial candidate in the Westminster election; and in January 1789 he himself entered parliament as member for Rye, a seat under Treasury control. He subsequently sat as member for Midhurst (1796&#150;1802) and for Wendover (1802&#150;6)&#151;boroughs whose parliamentary representatives were nominated by Pitt's friend Lord Carrington&#151;and for Haslemere (1806&#150;26), where the Pittite earl of Lonsdale was sole patron. In 1791 he became junior secretary to the Treasury, in that capacity acting as parliamentary whip and teller and in 1796 undertaking much of the management of the general election on the government's behalf. In 1801 he insisted on following Pitt out of office, and was rewarded with a pension of &pound;1500 per annum. At Pitt's behest he was prepared to advise Addington on Treasury matters and in 1802 was sworn of the privy council. In the following year he was the chief intermediary in negotiations between Pitt and Addington, which took place in his house at Bromley Hill in Kent. On Pitt's return to power in 1804 Long was made a lord of the Treasury (1804&#150;6) and then chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland (1805&#150;6). After Pitt's death in 1806 he took office in the Portland ministry as paymaster-general of the forces, a post which he retained until his retirement from politics in 1826. As a politician Long's ambitions were modest. &#145;Few persons&#146;, he told Lonsdale in 1809, &#145;have quitted an office with more reluctance than I retain mine.&#146; He did not consider himself &#145;either disposed or fit for a cabinet office&#146;, and refused both the chancellorship of the exchequer and the secretaryship at war when they were offered to him by Perceval. He rarely spoke in the house except on matters arising from his ministerial responsibilities, and was a loyal and efficient political adjutant rather than an initiator of policy. He was the author of pamphlets on the French Revolution (1795) and the price of bread (1800), and in 1792 was instrumental, with Sir James Bland Burges, in the foundation of the <span class="italic">Sun</span> newspaper as a tory organ. In 1820 Long was made a Knight of the Bath by George IV, and on his retirement from political life in 1826 he was created a peer with the title of Baron Farnborough (a village in Kent near his country residence). He was elected FRS in 1792, FSA in 1812, and was given an honorary LLD by his old university in 1833.<br>
<br>Long's real passion was for the arts. His resources were too small to allow him to be a major patron or collector in his own right, but as a minister and MP he used his influence to further artistic causes such as the purchase of the Elgin marbles and the establishment of the National Gallery. In 1792 it was he who acted as intermediary between Pitt and Humphry Repton over the improvement of the former's grounds at Holwood, and when the Altieri Claudes were brought to England in 1799 it was in Long's house in Grosvenor Place that they were first exhibited to English connoisseurs. In subsequent years his name appears repeatedly in connection with the public patronage of the arts. In 1802 he was the chairman of the committee of taste appointed to supervise the erection of monuments to the heroes of the Napoleonic wars, whose responsibilities were in 1809 extended to the repair (with money voted by parliament) of Henry VII's chapel at Westminster. Whether it was the appropriate order for the fa&ccedil;ade of the privy council offices in Whitehall (1824) or the need for a fig-leaf on the heroic statue honouring the duke of Wellington that had been subscribed for by the ladies of Great Britain (1821), Long was sure to be consulted. Such was his reputation as an arbiter of taste that in 1834, when steps were being taken to establish an Institution of British Architects, it was in the form of an open <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Farnborough</span> that the campaign was opened. He was an active trustee both of the British Museum and of the National Gallery (in whose establishment he played an important role) and as deputy director of the British Institution (or British Gallery) he was for many years a leading figure in its affairs.<br>
<br>Long's advice on artistic matters was valued at the highest level. Both as prince regent and as king, George IV frequently consulted him over the commissioning of architecture, painting, and sculpture. In Mrs Arbuthnot's opinion Long was &#145;a complete courtier, [who] always acquiesces in any thing the King says &amp; never dares contest a point with him&#146;, but the prince's secretary told Farington that in matters of art, &#145;The Prince Regent saw through Mr. Long's spectacles&#146;. It was Long who negotiated royal commissions with artists such as Canova, Westmacott, and Lawrence, and who (for instance) told the last of the prince's wishes that he should go to Rome to paint the portrait of Pope Pius VII for the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor. When the king determined to reconstruct Windsor Castle, Long drew up a detailed brief which envisaged every important feature of the castle as subsequently remodelled by Wyatville, from the heightening of the keep to the formation of the Grand Corridor, and he also suggested the sunken garden below the east terrace, for which he made a sketch-plan in 1823.<br>
<br>Long's own country villa at Bromley Hill in Kent, only a few miles from Pitt's at Holwood, was an elegant enlargement of an earlier house which he bought in 1801. Drawings made by Buckler at various dates between 1815 and 1835  (BL, Add. MS 36367, fols. 181&#150;92) show a villa irregularly composed in the Italianate manner with neo-classical interiors. The extensive grounds were progressively improved to create a much-admired garden which by 1809 offered two picturesque walks, each a mile long, and a distant view of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. Here Long entertained George IV, William IV, and Queen Adelaide, and here he died, childless, on 17 January 1838, leaving to the National Gallery paintings by Rubens, Vandyck, Canaletto, Teniers, Mola, Cuyp, and others.<br>
<br>As a young man Long had a mistress called Sophia Tarleton who died in Paris in 1789 or 1790, claiming that he had secretly married her. On 28 May 1793 he married Amelia [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16959/', "Long, Amelia")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14131/', "Sir Abraham Hume")</script> of Wormleybury, Hertfordshire; she died in January 1837. Lord and Lady Farnborough were both buried at Wormley church, where they are commemorated by a monument by Westmacott.<br>
