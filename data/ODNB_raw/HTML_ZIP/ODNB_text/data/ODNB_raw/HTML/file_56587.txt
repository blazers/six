<span class="headword">Cranston <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Cochrane]</span>,  Catherine <span class="st"> [Kate]</span></span>  (1849&#150;1934), <span class="occ">tea-room proprietor</span>, was born on 27 May 1849 at 39 George Square, Glasgow. Often known as Kate, she was the only daughter and youngest of the three children of George Cranston, hotel-keeper (1817&#150;1899), and his wife, Grace Lace (<i>c</i>.1811&#150;1867). She had two half-brothers, William (<i>b</i>. 1840) and Robert (<i>b</i>. 1843), the offspring of her father's first marriage, to Janet Gibson. George Cranston, previously a baker and pastrymaker, kept a succession of hotels in George Square (the Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Crow, and finally the Crown) from about 1849 to 1874 when the family moved to 91 Sauchiehall Street. From 1882, when her brother Stuart married and moved to Bearsden, Kate lived at 425 Sauchiehall Street with her widowed father and older brother George, who died in 1884, staying there until or just after her own marriage in 1892. By this time the Cranston name was well known in connection with tea-rooms.<br>
<br>It was Kate Cranston's brother, <a name="cosubject_56588"></a><span class="headword">Stuart Cranston</span>  (1848&#150;1921), <span class="occ">tea dealer and tea-room proprietor</span>, who claimed for Glasgow the &#145;invention&#146; of tea-rooms. He entered the tea trade as a teenager, and in 1871 established his own business as Stuart Cranston &amp; Co. A passionate champion of good tea, he opened a room in 1875 at 2 Queen Street, Glasgow, and charged for sampling at 2<i>d</i>. a cup, &#145;bread and cakes extra&#146;. This caught on and Cranston opened further suites of tea- and smoking-rooms alongside his dry tea business. With five branches in Glasgow's city centre, supported by substantial property investment, he formed Cranston's Tea Rooms Ltd in 1896. Further tea-rooms opened in 1898, 1907, and 1914, and fine coffee became another specialism. A restless entrepreneur with a slightly obsessive nature, Cranston was a keen musician, long-serving yeoman, a proselytizing fruitarian, and like his sister a practical if not paid-up abstainer. He retired from the business in 1915, and died on 17 October 1921 at 28 Bank Street, Glasgow, leaving a widow, Flora Mackinlay MacLachlan, and a daughter, Sybil. The company ran on until 1955.<br>
<br>Despite Stuart Cranston's vigorous self-promotion it was Kate Cranston who became identified as the pioneer of the tea-room phenomenon of Glasgow's golden age between 1888 and 1911. In 1878 Kate Cranston established her Crown Tea Rooms beneath a temperance hotel at 114 Argyle Street, with moral and financial support from her father's Edinburgh cousins, the Waverley Temperance Hotel Cranstons. She was also helped by her brother when she opened another branch at 205 Ingram Street in 1886. Confusion was inevitable, but after 1889 the distinction between Cranston's Tea Rooms and Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms was clearly drawn and the businesses were quite separately developed. Miss Cranston's more substantial catering (she described herself as a restaurateur) together with a feminine note in d&eacute;cor became the model for the typical Glasgow tea-room. In challenging social disapproval of middle-class women in business she paved the way to money-earning for many able imitators.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1892 Kate married John Cochrane (1857&#150;1917), owner of an engineering works and later provost of Barrhead, a quiet, pleasant, and artistically disposed man some eight years her junior. There were no children from the marriage. From about 1893 they rented East Park, Barrhead; then from 1904 Hous'hill, a fine house at Nitshill, south-west of Glasgow. Marriage marked not a termination of her career, but an era of expansion for &#145;Miss Cranston&#146; as she remained in business, though she was Mrs Cochrane in private life.<br>
<br>In 1894 Kate Cranston acquired property at 91&#150;93 Buchanan Street, perhaps as a wedding present from her husband. On this site rose a lavish new building, opened in 1897. Its unconventional interior decoration by George Walton and Charles Rennie Mackintosh earned immediate notoriety. Work in 1898&#150;9 by the same pair on the redevelopment of the whole building at Miss Cranston's original Argyle Street location (the extended lease was acquired about 1895), and by Mackintosh at Ingram Street in 1900, established a strongly &#145;artistic&#146; house style for her tea-rooms. By 1901 when she catered at the Glasgow International Exhibition, &#145;Kate Cranstonish&#146; had become a Glasgow term, as Neil Munro recalled, for &#145;domestic novelties in buildings and decorations not otherwise easy to define&#146;  (Munro, 198). Her reputation was confirmed by Mackintosh's glittering Willow Tea Rooms on Sauchiehall Street, opened in October 1903. The stream of smaller jobs which she gave Mackintosh right up to 1916&#150;17 were of great importance through difficult times for this isolated architect. For her sustained patronage of Glasgow's most avant-garde designers Miss Cranston, as Pevsner says, &#145;deserves the art historian's unstinted gratitude&#146;  (Pevsner, 538).<br>
<br>Kate Cranston's eccentrically old-fashioned style of dress&#151;mid-Victorian flounces and quirky hats&#151;betokened a characteristic readiness to flout convention in pursuit of what she liked. Described by Edwin Lutyens as &#145;a dark, busy, fat, wee body with black sparky luminous eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edwin Lutyens</span>, 56), she had a good sense of humour and was sociable and kindly, but could also be imperious and quite formidable. As a businesswoman she was naturally aware of the publicity value of her singular tastes.<br>
<br>Miss Cranston became one of the most widely cherished and respected figures in Glasgow. It was she, not her brother, who entered <span class="italic">Who's Who in Glasgow</span> (1909), one of seven women and the only businesswoman. She received another accolade in 1911 when she was the subject of the &#145;Men you know&#146; profile in <span class="italic">The Bailie</span> of 26 July, which accurately detailed her &#145;gifts of organisation, management, taste, originality, hard work, and perseverance, and her great shrewdness in judging as to what people want&#146;, crediting her with a catering revolution &#145;in which temperance, comfort, elegance, and economy are allied in a fine progressive form&#146;. As an employer she was a perfectionist and disciplinarian who was keenly concerned for her girls' welfare.<br>
<br>The death of her husband in October 1917 shattered her, as they were &#145;a most devoted couple&#146;  (private information), and Cochrane had been a considerable support in business. She disposed of the tearooms, took to dressing in black, and left Hous'hill with its Mackintosh interiors to live in the North British Station Hotel back in George Square for most of the rest of her life. In her last years she became vague and alarming, and died of &#145;senile decay&#146; compounded by heart problems on 18 April 1934 at 34 Terregles Avenue, Glasgow, where she had gone to live with a companion. She was buried in Neilston cemetery. The bulk of her considerable estate was left to charity.<br>
<br>Mackintosh's Willow Tea Rooms on Sauchiehall Street, heavily restored, in the 1990s were functioning again in part as tea-rooms. His interiors for the Ingram Street tea-rooms, neglected and finally dismantled in 1971, have since been partially reconstructed for display, the Ladies' Luncheon Room forming the centrepiece of the Mackintosh exhibition held in Glasgow in 1996.<br>
