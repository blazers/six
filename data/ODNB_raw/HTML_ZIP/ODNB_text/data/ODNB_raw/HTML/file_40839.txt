<span class="headword">Ward,  Stephen Thomas</span>  (1912&#150;1963), <span class="occ">osteopath and scapegoat</span>, was born on 19 October 1912 at Lemsford vicarage, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, second of three sons of Arthur Evelyn Ward (1877&#150;1944), clergyman, and his wife, Eileen Esm&eacute;e (1881&#150;1955), daughter of Thomas Mercer Cliffe Vigors, Anglo-Irish landowner. He was a descendant of the second Baron Castlemaine and first cousin of the traveller Wilfred Thesiger. After schooling at Canford, he worked as a translator in Hamburg (1929&#150;30) and as a Parisian tourist guide while studying at the Sorbonne (<i>c</i>.1930&#150;1932). Next he qualified in osteopathy at Kirksville, Missouri (1934&#150;9), which entitled him to practise as a physician in the USA; he henceforth used the prefix of doctor, but had no British medical qualifications.<br>
<br>After briefly practising osteopathy in Torquay, Ward entered the Royal Armoured Corps as a private, reaching the rank of captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Settling in London after the war, his first important patient was the US ambassador Averell Harriman. In 1947 he set up an osteopathic practice in Cavendish Square. Although Lady Gladwyn &#145;disliked his jaunty conceited manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of Cynthia Gladwyn</span>, 288), she acknowledged the efficacy of his techniques; her fellow patients (including Sir Winston Churchill, Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Getty, King Peter of Yugoslavia) were more appreciative of Ward's fluent, ingratiating, well-informed conversation. Uninhibited, indiscreet, carefree, kind, plausible, and charming, his voice was rich and resonant. He was an inveterate name-dropper who delighted in crossing social barriers. From early manhood he was fascinated by prostitution and relished the company of beautiful women, but he had a low libido. On 27 July 1949 he married an actress, Patricia Mary (<i>b</i>. 1928), daughter of Eric Clifford Kingsley Baines, textiles company director. The marriage failed after six weeks and was ended by divorce three years later. He became more dissolute with age, although his preference was for talking about other people's sexual activity rather than for acting himself.<br>
<br>Ward attended classes at the Slade School of Art, and a new phase of his career opened with an exhibition of his sketches of patients (12 July 1960). He supplied the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> with further celebrity sketches and the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> with drawings of Adolf Eichmann's trial (1961). He hoped to sketch the Politburo, and was introduced by his patient Colin Coote, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, to Yevgeny Ivanov, the Russian naval attach&eacute;. Ward was soon enlisted by MI5 in an attempt to entrap Ivanov (June 1961), became a messenger between British and Soviet intelligence, and was an unofficial intermediary during the Cuban missile crisis (1962). Briefly Ward had real utility, but overrated his influence.<br>
<br>In 1956 the third Viscount Astor, who had been Ward's friend and patient since 1950, allowed him to lease for a peppercorn rent Spring Cottage in his grounds at Cliveden. In July 1961 Astor held a house party attended by John Profumo, minister for war. Ward's guests that weekend included Ivanov and Christine Keeler, with whom Ward had intermittently lived on a non-sexual basis since 1959. For some months until December 1961 Keeler and Profumo had an affair. This need not have caused a public convulsion, but after an interval was exploited by George Wigg MP, whose mischief-making resulted in Profumo making a formal denial in the House of Commons of &#145;impropriety &hellip; with Miss Keeler&#146; (22 March 1963). This was the first public sensation of the Profumo affair, a moral panic in which fears of foreign espionage were muddled together with political opportunism, prurience, and malice under the cover of cant phrases about maintaining standards in public life. Ward and Keeler both confirmed Profumo's statement, but on 26 March Ward spoke with na&iuml;ve candour to Wigg in an effort to minimize the scandal. Perhaps he was shadowed to his meeting with the Labour MP, for the next day the Conservative home secretary, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37227/', "Henry Brooke (1903&#150;1984)")</script>, who wanted Ward discredited or silenced, asked the commissioner of police if there was police interest in Ward. A wide investigation was launched on 1 April to see if Ward could be caught for a crime. Up to 140 of his friends and patients were repeatedly interviewed in a campaign of harassment (Keeler was interviewed twenty-four times). The police pressurized and intimidated witnesses in a fishing operation which destroyed Ward's osteopathic practice. Initially Ward was co-operative, believing that his intelligence work would secure his immunity from this persecution, but when he realized that he was being set up as a scapegoat he contacted journalists, and at a meeting with the prime minister's private secretary and a representative of the Security Service declared that Profumo's Commons denial had been untrue. Profumo resigned on 4 June.<br>
<br>On 8 June, in an act of political revenge, Ward was arrested and charged under the <span class="roman">Sexual Offences Act</span> of 1956 with living on immoral earnings. He had introduced men and women who had subsequently slept together, but the allegation that he was a pimp would have been impossible to sustain in a less politically hysterical atmosphere. Ward's trial, which was hurriedly opened at the Old Bailey on 22 July, was one of historic injustice. It established him as the British Dreyfus. The charges were dubious; the testimony of prostitutes dredged up by the police was never reliable. But the prosecuting counsel, Mervyn Griffith-Jones (who in 1960 had been the senior prosecuting counsel in the unsuccessful prosecution of Penguin Books for publishing an unexpurgated version of D. H. Lawrence's <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>), blackened Ward's character with a closing speech which presented verdicts of guilty as the jury's patriotic duty. In the early morning of 31 July, before the last day of the trial, Ward took thirty-five grains of Nembutal barbiturate. &#145;It is really more than I can stand&#151;the horror day after day at the court and in the streets&#146;, he wrote in his suicide note. &#145;I am sorry to disappoint the vultures. &hellip; Delay resuscitation as long as possible&#146; (Knightley and Kennedy, 245; Crawford, 170). The judge having refused to halt the trial, Ward was found guilty, but no sentence was announced before his death, after eighty hours in a coma, on 3 August 1963 at St Stephen's Hospital, Fulham Road, London. He was cremated at Mortlake (9 August). Ward was in fact incidental to the Profumo episode: he was a sacrificial offering. The exorcism of scandal in high places required the fa&ccedil;ade of his conviction on vice charges.<br>
<br>John Hurt acted the part of Ward in the film <span class="italic">Scandal</span> (1989).<br>
