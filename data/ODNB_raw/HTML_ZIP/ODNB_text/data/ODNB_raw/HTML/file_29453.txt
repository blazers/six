<span class="headword">William</span> <span class="st"> [William &AElig;theling, William Adelinus, William Adelingus]</span>  (1103&#150;1120), <span class="occ">prince</span>, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12948/', "Henry I")</script> and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18336/', "Matilda of Scotland")</script>, was born in 1103, probably in the third quarter of the year or earlier; Pope Paschal II sent congratulations on his birth on 23 November. For the first time since 1066 the reigning king had a single legitimate son. William's short life was governed by his father's natural wish to assure his obvious heir's undisputed succession to both England and Normandy and if possible to add to those lands the county of Maine, coveted by the counts of Anjou and the dukes of Normandy since before the Norman conquest of England. But Henry I's ambitions inevitably troubled the French king, Louis VI, who in his turn promoted the cause of Henry's nephew, William Clito, son of his dispossessed eldest brother, Robert, who was a little older than his cousin the &AElig;theling.<br>
<br>According to William of Malmesbury, the &AElig;theling was trained for the succession with fond hope and immense care. Otuel or Othuer Fitzearl, bastard son of Hugh, earl of Chester, was appointed tutor to William and his bastard brothers, in one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23716/', "Robert, earl of Gloucester")</script>, Otuel is said to have instilled a love of letters. Otuel was made by the king castellan of the Tower of London, a likely scene of part of William's upbringing. High hopes were vested in the young William as the offspring of a marriage which restored the line of Cerdic to the throne through his mother, and a prophecy by Edward the Confessor on his deathbed was said to have foreseen William as the happy outcome. Oddly only one chronicler, Orderic Vitalis, who was but half English, gave to William&#151;as many as seven times&#151;the English princely title of &AElig;theling (Adelinus, later Adelingus), and said that all regarded him as the lawful heir. William was, after all, great-nephew of Edgar &AElig;theling and great-grandson of Edward &AElig;theling (the Exile); but the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> called him simply &#145;the king's son&#146;, whereas William's wholly Norman cousin was merely called Clito (from the Latin <i>inclitus</i>); however, Orderic's usage has even led some modern historians to call the &AElig;theling William Adelin.<br>
<br>In 1113, when William was ten, he began to attest royal documents and became the instrument of his father's diplomacy: in February, near Alen&ccedil;on, he was betrothed to Matilda, the young daughter of Foulques (V), count of Anjou and Maine. Two years after the betrothal began the process of assuring the Anglo-Norman succession: in 1115 William received the homage and fealty of the barons of Normandy, and in March 1116, in his father's presence, he received the homage and fealty of the magnates of England. Following the death of his mother on 1 May 1118 William is deemed to have acted as regent while his father was in Normandy, though the precepts issued in his name cannot be precisely dated. However, in December 1118 Henry suffered a serious setback when his troops were defeated by the Angevins in a battle at Alen&ccedil;on. The significance of this defeat has been little appreciated because Henry soon recovered. He bribed Foulques of Anjou into deserting the Capetians and agreeing to the marriage of William and Matilda, which took place at Lisieux in June 1119; Foulques settled the county of Maine on them as their marriage gift, and also Anjou should he die on his crusade. War against Louis VI followed. William was with his father on 20 August 1119 at the battle of Br&eacute;mule, and after Henry's victory returned the captured palfrey of his cousin William Clito, whose claims lay behind all the discord, perhaps in imitation of his father's return to Louis of the latter's war-horse and archives. In November 1119 William was able to add experience of diplomacy to that of warfare: his father took William with him for his meeting near Gisors with Pope Calixtus II, to whom the &AElig;theling was second cousin once removed.<br>
<br>In the middle of 1119 William's status may have reached its peak: in an interpolated charter issued at Rouen he witnessed as &#145;dei gratia rex designatus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. RAN</span>, 2, no. 1204), though only the Anglo-Norman Eadmer speaks of a formal sanction for this designation. In 1120 William did homage to Louis VI for the duchy of Normandy itself. This was the obvious and later the usual means of overcoming the reluctance of a king to do homage to another king of whom he held a fief. Thus in a piecemeal fashion William's succession to Normandy, Maine, and England was assured; but when Henry embarked for England with his son from Barfleur on 25 November 1120, all the king's achievements were overthrown by one of the greatest and most frequently recounted personal tragedies of English history. Henry sailed first, having turned down the offer of a new ship&#151;the <i>White Ship</i>&#151;from Thomas Fitzstephen; the &AElig;theling and his retinue (reminiscent of the youthful entourage once enjoyed by his uncle Robert Curthose) followed in the new vessel. But the inebriated crew and passengers were in no fit condition for a night voyage, and the ship was rowed onto a rock (still identifiable) outside the harbour of Barfleur. The &AElig;theling was put into a small boat and would have escaped had he not turned back on hearing an appeal for help from his bastard sister, whereupon the boat was overloaded by others seeking safety, and sank. There was only one survivor, and few bodies were recovered; Otuel Fitzearl, and many others of high birth, drowned with the prince.<br>
<br>William was just over seventeen when he died. He had no children with Matilda (who had crossed to England with King Henry and after some delay was returned to her father, later becoming first a nun and then abbess of Fontevrault), and Henry's plans were in ruins. According to Gervase of Canterbury the prince and his companions were swollen with pride and love of lust and luxury; and there are dark and unprovable hints that he would have been a harsh ruler of his English subjects. The recorded incidents of his short life may suggest that he had strong family affections&#151;or a love, eventually fatal to himself, of the grand gesture. William had received some training for the kingship which he was never to exercise, but perhaps by using the word &#145;<i>adolescentulus</i>&#146; to describe him, Malmesbury was casting doubt on his potential.<br>
