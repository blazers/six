<span class="headword">Sharp, Sir  Cuthbert</span>  (1781&#150;1849), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Hartlepool, co. Durham, the son of Cuthbert Sharp, a shipowner, and his wife, Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1794), the daughter of Hercules Crosby of Stockton. His mother was the sister of Brass Crosby, the controversial lord mayor of London and an important figure in political history, especially in connection with the publication of parliamentary debates. Sharp was educated at Greenwich in the school of the eminent Greek scholar Dr Charles Burney. When he was about eighteen he took a commission in the Essex fencibles, a cavalry force introduced by the government for the defence of the kingdom. He saw action in Ireland and, having studied briefly at Edinburgh University, became one of the first Britons to visit Paris after the peace of Amiens of 1801. When the treaty broke down he was taken as a prisoner of war but used influence to stay on parole in the French capital. While there he made himself an expert in the language and customs of France. After being a prisoner &#145;for some years&#146;  (Brockie, 143) he returned to England via the Netherlands. In 1811 he eloped with Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Croudace of Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland. Two marriage ceremonies were performed, the first at Coldstream on 15 October and the second at the English church, Edinburgh, on 22 October. There appears to have been one child from the marriage&#151;a daughter, Louise Laura.<br>
<br>Sources agree that the main focus of Sharp's life thereafter became literary, and three publications, in particular, are worthy of reference. His <span class="italic">Bishoprick Garland</span> (1834), a mixture of scraps of north-eastern songs and traditional nursery rhymes, was reprinted at the end of the twentieth century and used by researchers into cultural history. His <span class="italic">History of Hartlepool</span> (1816), reprinted in 1851 with an appendix by the publisher and historian John Proctor, still stands as the standard history of the ancient port and borough of Hartlepool. His <span class="italic">Memorials of the Rebellion of 1569</span>, culled from primary sources, was highly rated by nineteenth-century biographers. He also composed a large number of tracts and Durham family trees, many of which have since been proved inaccurate.<br>
<br>Although he was registered as &#145;retired&#146; and devoted himself to &#145;literary pursuits&#146;  (Brockie, 143) possibly from his twenties, Sharp also led an active public life. Living in Hartlepool after his return from France, he served as mayor in 1813, 1816, and 1824 and was knighted in 1814 &#145;on presenting an address to the Prince Regent&#146;  (Latimer, 265). Between 1823 and 1845 his main residence was in Sunderland, where he was collector of customs for twenty-two years. From 1845 to 1849 he filled a similar position at the larger port of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was heavily involved in freemasonry, and rose from minor office in the Sunderland branch in the 1820s to the position of deputy provincial grand master of the province of Durham from 1832. He was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, having been recommended by Burney, among others, in 1810. He resigned in 1825 on account of financial problems.<br>
<br>Brief nineteenth-century biographies afford some small insight into both Sharp's looks and character. Local legend in Sunderland held that Queen Victoria had once described him as &#145;the ugliest man that has come to my court&#146;  (Corder, MSS 33&#150;4). Despite his apparent popularity at school and even as customs collector, he had family problems and feuded with his daughter, though they were reconciled late in his life. He had friends of consequence, including Robert Surtees, whom he helped with his <span class="italic">History of Durham</span>, and, through Surtees, Sir Walter Scott, who corresponded with Sharp in verse on antiquarian matters.<br>
<br>Sharp was in poor health when he took up his new post in Newcastle in 1845. He was about to tender his resignation as customs collector when he died there, at his house in Northumberland Street, on 17 August 1849.<br>
