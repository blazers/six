<span class="headword">Hitchcock,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1573&#150;1591), <span class="occ">soldier and writer</span>, described himself as a gentleman of Caverfield, Buckinghamshire, and the family is known to have had property in the county in the late fifteenth century. His right to Caverfield was disputed by two other claimants, but in March 1573 judgment was given in Star Chamber, apparently in his favour. Hitchcock's vocation was war. In the early 1580s, as England prepared for war with Spain, he was selected among the &#145;Marshall men &amp; captaines &hellip; to be presently imployd&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 113, fol. 148<i>r</i>), and other sources also testify to considerable experience. In 1586 he raised nearly 200 &#145;voluntarie men&#146; from Buckinghamshire for a company in Dutch service, though it was among several &#145;cassed&#146; (disbanded) by the states general in spring 1587. Hitchcock received the last &pound;145 owed him by the Dutch only on 29 June 1588, and since he collected the arrears due to three other English captains, he was probably liked and certainly trusted by his fellow officers. Between July and October 1587 he commanded a 150-strong band from Buckinghamshire in the royal army that unsuccessfully attempted to relieve Sluys. This was his last active service.<br>
<br>Hitchcock was also a writer. His early works were on military strategy and circulated only in manuscript, though they attracted attention. John Foxe kept a copy of Hitchcock's &#145;A discourse for defence against the threatened invasion of the Holy League&#146; (BL, Lansdowne MS 389, fols. 339<i>r</i>&#150;350<i>v</i>), which Strype praised in his <span class="italic">Annals of the Reformation</span>. Written in 1571, it was submitted to the queen in 1580; her grant to Hitchcock a year later of lands worth &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a year suggests she approved of it. In January 1581 Hitchcock published his first book, <span class="italic">A politique platt for the honour of the prince, the greate profite of the publique states, reliefe of the poore, preservation of the rich, reformation of roges and idle persons, and the wealthe of thousands</span>, with a preface by his brother Francis. It detailed a scheme for developing the Newfoundland herring fisheries that had come before parliament in 1576. Hitchcock had invited virtually all the MPs for seaport boroughs to a lavish dinner in an attempt to win their support. Thomas Digges, another soldier interested in technical matters, introduced the proposal into the Commons, but an early prorogation of parliament prevented further progress. In 1590 Hitchcock published <span class="italic">The Quintessence of Wit</span>, a translation from the Italian of a miscellany of Francisco Sansovino's work. Finally, in 1591 he published <span class="italic">The Arte of Warre</span>, written by William Garrard, another veteran of the Dutch wars, who had died in 1587. Hitchcock &#145;corrected, finished and published Garrard's MS&#146;  (Webb, 48), but appended an original work on logistics, <span class="italic">A Generall Proportion and Order for Provision</span>.<br>
<br>The soldier&#150;writers in late sixteenth-century England formed a close circle. Robert Hitchcock, unlike Thomas Churchyard, Barnaby Rich, Barnaby Googe, Roger Williams, or George Gascoigne (all of whom he must have known), wrote neither prose narratives nor verse. Nor does he compare to them in literary quality: as he admitted, others wrote with &#145;pleasanter wordes and [more] sugred stile then I&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Politique Platt</span>, preface). Nevertheless, he was a member, albeit a marginal one, of a group that was of great importance in the English literary renaissance. The date of his death is unknown.<br>
