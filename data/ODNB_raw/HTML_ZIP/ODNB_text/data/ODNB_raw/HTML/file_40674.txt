<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hicks, Sir  John Richard</span>  (1904&#150;1989), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born in Warwick on 8 April 1904, the eldest of the three children and only son of Edward Hicks, editor and part proprietor of the <span class="italic">Warwick and Leamington Spa Courier</span>, of Leamington Spa, and his wife, Dorothy Catherine Stephens, who was one of five children of a nonconformist minister. There was an intellectual tradition on both sides of his family, particularly that of his mother, where there was a connection with the political scientist Graham Wallas. Hicks received much intellectual stimulus from the head of his preparatory school, Grey Friars, near Leamington Spa&#151;more stimulus, probably, than he received from his public school, Clifton College. None the less he acquitted himself perfectly adequately at Clifton, and in 1922 won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, to study mathematics, in which he gained a first in moderations in 1923. His undergraduate contemporaries realized that his abilities were something out of the ordinary, as did his tutors. But he was not well taught, at least on the economics side of the new philosophy, politics, and economics school (to which he moved at the end of his first year). Something went seriously wrong with his performance in his final examinations, in which he obtained a second class (1925). His failure to get a first came as a serious set-back, and he was unsuccessful too in the All Souls fellowship examination.<br>
<br>Hicks tried for some months to follow his father's profession as a journalist, on the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>; but that was not congenial. In 1927 he obtained a BLitt (under the supervision, surprisingly, of G. D. H. Cole). He then made the decisive step in his life: in 1926 he moved to a teaching position at the London School of Economics (LSE), as a lecturer. His years there were the most important ones in his intellectual development. Hicks was the most eminent economic theorist of his generation in Britain. He was an economist's economist, much less well known to politicians and civil servants and to the general public than many other economists esteemed far less highly by their peers. Primarily, he was a conceptualizer. Concepts that he introduced were later used every day by economists who had almost forgotten their origin: income-effect / substitution-effect, &#145;Hicks-neutral&#146; technical progress, the portfolio approach to the demand for money, &#145;fix-price / flex-price&#146;, and a host of others. He was not an ivory-tower economist: he believed the purpose of economic theory was to be useful. But he himself was more a toolmaker than a tool-user. His contribution did not lie in establishing specific empirical conclusions or policy recommendations. The book of his that came nearest to seeking to establish a definite conclusion was something of a <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, <span class="italic">A Theory of Economic History</span> (1969).<br>
<br>There is no school of Hicksian economics, although Hicks did have in his own mind a consistent system of thought, which evolved over the years, but which already by the time of the publication of <span class="italic">Value and Capital</span> (1939)&#151;his most important book&#151;was reasonably comprehensive in its scope. Hicks might perhaps have found congenial the genre of an earlier epoch: the comprehensive treatise, revised through several editions. As it was, he was unusual among modern economic theorists in putting forward many of his chief ideas in books, nearly twenty of them, ranging over almost the whole of economic theory, rather than in articles, though his collected articles also amounted to three substantial volumes. Among his articles were &#145;Mr Keynes and the classic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Econometrica</span>, 1937), which shaped economists' understanding of the Keynesian system for decades to come, and &#145;A suggestion for simplifying the theory of money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Economica</span>, 1935), which anticipated part of that system.<br>
<br>It may be conjectured that Hicks's approach was affected by the nearly complete <i>tabula rasa</i> that he brought to the LSE as a result of the weakness of his economic education in Oxford. He felt that he had to work things out for himself, almost from first principles, into his own consistent system of thought. That is not to say that his system of thought did not owe much to the great economists of the past&#151;continental rather than British. The ideas of his contemporaries were also grist to his mill; but their status was no higher than that. &#145;I could not understand what others were doing,&#146; he said, &#145;unless I could re-state it in my own terms.&#146; His writings give an occasional impression of vanity. But the vanity was not for himself but on behalf of his work.<br>
<br>Hicks's later work continued to attract very serious attention. But with the vast proliferation in the literature of the subject, it inevitably seemed less innovative than what he had done in the golden years at the LSE. In addition, although the contemporary development of economic theory took its impetus in no small part from value and capital, he was out of sympathy with much of it. He wrote, about his successors, largely American:<blockquote>I have disappointed them, &hellip; I have felt little sympathy with the theory for theory's sake, which has been characteristic of one strand of American economics; nor with the idealisation of the free market, which has been characteristic of another; and I have little faith in the econometrics on which they have largely relied to make their contact with reality.</blockquote>At the LSE, but not later, Hicks worked in close association with others of his own age and standing&#151;R. G. D. Allen, Nicholas Kaldor, A. P. Lerner, and several others, as well as the more senior Friedrich von Hayek. In later years he gave encouragement and discerning help to his graduate students, relatively few in number. They came mainly from overseas, particularly Italy. Hicks left the LSE in 1935 to go to Cambridge as a university lecturer and fellow of Gonville and Caius College. In Cambridge Dennis Robertson became a good friend, and so remained until Robertson's death. But unfortunately the already powerful Keynesian school in the faculty made clear that it had room for only one god in the pantheon of economic theory: it was not interested in what Hicks was doing. So Hicks was glad to take the chair of political economy in Manchester in 1938, where he stayed until 1946. A fellowship in the newly established Nuffield College in Oxford then offered an attractive opportunity, with fewer administrative responsibilities; he held this post until 1958. The LSE may have been the place that left its strongest intellectual imprint, but Oxford was where by far the largest part of his long life was spent. He moved to All Souls as Drummond professor of political economy in 1952, a post he held until 1965. In all he was a fellow of All Souls for thirty-five years. He was greatly devoted to the college. He was a very active delegate of the Oxford University Press.<br>
<br>Hicks received innumerable academic honours, in addition to his fellowship of the British Academy (1942) and his knighthood (1964). He was the first British scholar to win the Nobel prize in economics (1972); he gave the proceeds to the appeal then in progress for the new LSE library. He was an honorary fellow of the LSE (1969) and of Gonville and Caius (1971).<br>
<br>In 1935 he married an assistant lecturer at the LSE, Ursula Kathleen, the daughter of William Fisher Webb, solicitor, of Dublin. For the rest of his life, until her death in 1985, they were seldom separated, even for a few days. Their marriage was unusual by conventional standards and there were no children. Their characters were entirely unalike: he was shy, she was outgoing; she was direct, he was subtle. But she protected him and organized their lives; and their loyalty to each other was unswerving. They were both obsessive travellers. Hicks died suddenly, of a heart attack, on 20 May 1989 in the house at Blockley, Gloucestershire, which had been his principal home for many years.<br>
