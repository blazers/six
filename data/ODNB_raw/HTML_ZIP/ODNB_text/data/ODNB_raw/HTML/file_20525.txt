<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Conor,  Charles</span>  (1710&#150;1791), <span class="occ">antiquary and religious propagandist</span>, was born on 1 January 1710 at Kilmactranny, co. Sligo, Ireland, the eldest son of Denis O'Conor (<i>d</i>. 1750), farmer, and Mary O'Rourke (<i>d</i>. 1760?), daughter of Tiernan O'Rourke, a colonel in the French army who was killed in the battle of Luzara in 1702. Both his paternal grandfather and great-uncle had fought on the Jacobite side in 1688&#150;90. As a result, the family estate at Belanagare, co. Roscommon, was confiscated, but for technical reasons a significant portion of it was restored in 1703, although the family did not return to live there until the 1720s. The O'Conors of Belanagare were a prime example of the last remnants of the native Irish landowning nobility, particularly since they were descended from the last nominal high-king of Ireland, Ruaidhr&iacute; O Conchobhair (Rory O'Conor). They continued the Gaelic tradition of artistic and scholarly patronage, and hence in the 1720s the young Charles received instruction from Dominic O Duigenan, one of a family of hereditary historians, under whose direction he first began to copy Gaelic manuscripts. His uncle, Thaddeus O'Rourke, Catholic bishop of Killala, was unable to move freely about the country in this period of strict state control of the clergy. He was thus free to supervise the education of his nephew, so that in addition to traditional Gaelic learning O'Conor attained proficiency in standard classical subjects, for which purpose he was also sent to the Skelton Academy in Dublin for a period. In addition he was taught music by Turlough O'Carolan, the famous harper, who availed of the O'Conors' patronage.<br>
<br>On 8 December 1731 O'Conor married Catherine Fagan (<i>d</i>. 1741), daughter of John Fagan, and settled on a farm in co. Roscommon. They had four children before Catherine's death in 1741. In 1750, on the death of his father, O'Conor took possession of the family estate at Belanagare. He was concerned to build up the estate and reported later in life that partly through land reclamation he had amassed somewhere between 700 and 800 acres of farming land. As a gentleman farmer he began to collect Gaelic manuscripts and to make copies and extracts of others. Among his collection was an original edition of the first part of the <span class="italic">Ann&aacute;la r&iacute;oghachta &Eacute;ireann</span> by M&iacute;che&aacute;l O Cl&eacute;irigh and his assistants. Increasingly, he was asked by non-Gaelic-speaking historians to make extracts and translations from manuscripts in his possession. He was thus an important link in a tradition of scribal activity dating back to medieval times.<br>
<br>In 1748 O'Conor's most famous antiquarian work, <span class="italic">Dissertations on the Antient History of Ireland</span>, first appeared anonymously in separate numbers; it was later published in book form in 1753. This series of essays on the pre-colonial period of Irish history was in the tradition of earlier works by Geoffrey Keating and Hugh MacCurtin, among others, which defended the early Irish against the charge of barbarism made by many, mainly English, writers. O'Conor aimed to show the &#145;indelible signatures of the Use of Govt and Letters in Ireland&#146; long before the arrival of Christianity in the sixth century. Although he consulted the medieval Gaelic annals in his possession, his depiction of pre-colonial Ireland was mainly shaped by his political concerns, in particular the iniquities of the penal laws in force against Catholics in his own time. Thus he claimed that early Christian Ireland was a haven of religious toleration and &#145;true Liberty&#146;, where none was punished who &#145;submitted to the Laws of the Land&#146; and where conversion was achieved by persuasion, &#145;the only Manner in which it can be conducted&#146;  (C. O'Conor, <span class="italic">Dissertations on the Antient History of Ireland</span>, 86&#150;7). Reflecting his immersion in Enlightenment writing on progress, he argued that early Irish history was the story of the gradual triumph of liberty and virtue over faction and tyranny  (ibid., x).<br>
<br>A second edition of the book was published in 1766, but &#145;antient&#146; was removed from the title and the text was amended in places quite significantly, to the extent that it should be treated as a separate work. Its central theme was unaltered, but the breathless writing style of the first edition was jettisoned in favour of a more polished one. More important, many of the changes involved the removal of passages which could be considered impolitic, such as one on the role of the Gaelic poets in stirring up rebellion after the Anglo-Norman conquest. The 1766 edition, which appeared under O'Conor's name, omitted the entire chapter on the colonial era and substituted for it an essay disputing the authenticity of James Macpherson's Ossian poems.<br>
<br>In 1760 O'Conor gave over the main house and the management of the estate to his eldest son, Denis, and built a smaller house in the grounds which he called his &#145;hermitage&#146;. For the last three decades of his life he divided his time between the hermitage and Dublin, where most of his friends and interests were. Together with his friend the historian John Curry and Thomas Wyse he founded the Catholic Committee in 1760 to represent Catholic interests and to press for the relaxation of the penal laws. O'Conor wrote anonymously a number of pamphlets in support of the Catholic cause, including <span class="italic">A Counter Appeal to the People of Ireland</span> (1749) and <span class="italic">The Case of the Roman Catholics of Ireland</span> (1755). Adopting an English protestant identity in most of these, he argued that the laws had a catastrophic economic effect by discouraging Catholic industry as well as investment. He also maintained that Irish Catholics were loyal subjects, and together with Curry and others he formulated addresses and petitions designed to show this. He was much involved in the drawing up of a test oath for Catholics, which was the basis of a <span class="roman">Test Act</span> passed in 1774.<br>
<br>Following the publication of the second edition of the <span class="italic">Dissertations</span> O'Conor was acknowledged as the foremost Irish antiquary and had entry to some of the wealthiest and most influential protestant as well as Catholic circles at a time when the protestant &eacute;lite was becoming interested in the Gaelic past. Thus he socialized with George Faulkner, the prominent Dublin printer, and with William Burton (later Burton Conyngham), teller of the exchequer and enthusiast for Gaelic antiquities. Thomas Leland, the librarian at Trinity College, Dublin, invited him to consult the library's great holdings of Gaelic manuscripts in 1766. He was invited to become a member of three protestant-sponsored learned societies concerned with antiquities, the short-lived select committee for antiquities of the Dublin Society (1772&#150;4), the Hibernian Antiquarian Society (1778&#150;83), and the Royal Irish Academy, which was founded in 1785. O'Conor's success in straddling these two worlds can be seen in a letter to his son of February 1779, in which he recounted attending a dinner party at William Burton's house where the topic was Irish antiquities, followed a few days later by his attendance at a meeting of the Catholic Committee. Yet in spite of this success O'Conor, as a Catholic, was vulnerable in very immediate ways to the penal laws against which he campaigned. In 1777 his youngest brother, Hugh, conformed to the Church of Ireland and sued for possession of the family property under laws relating to Catholic property. The case dragged on for eight years and was finally settled out of court, but Charles wasted much time and expense on it. At one point, just weeks after dining with William Burton, O'Conor was put under house arrest for his attorney's failure to comply with court requirements.<br>
<br>O'Conor continued his antiquarian researches and writings well into his seventies, publishing, for example, three articles in Charles Vallancey's journal, <span class="italic">Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis</span>, between 1782 and 1784. He was too feeble to make progress on his larger project, a history of Ireland from the earliest times up to the Restoration, which remained unpublished. He lived long enough to see many of the penal laws dismantled and in 1785 noted with satisfaction that &#145;no man is now forbid[den] the benefits of our Civil Constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles O'Conor of Belanagare</span>, ed. C. C. Ward and R. E. Ward, 2.227). All his work had tended towards that object and for this reason his antiquarian writings, though having a certain significance in the history of scholarship, are immeasurably more important for giving a profound insight into Irish Catholic political concerns in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>O'Conor died at Belanagare on 1 July 1791. His grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20526/', "Charles O'Conor (1764&#150;1828)")</script>, Roman Catholic priest, wrote a life of him, the first volume of which was published in 1796 but quickly suppressed because of its polemical and inaccurate account.<br>
