<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mercer,  Joseph</span>  (1914&#150;1990), <span class="occ">footballer and football manager</span>, was born on 9 August 1914 at 32 Queen Street, Ellesmere Port, Wirral, Cheshire, the eldest in the family of three boys and one girl of Joseph Powell Mercer, professional footballer, of Ellesmere Port, and his wife, Ethel Breeze. He was educated at Cambridge Road School and John Street Senior Mixed School, Ellesmere Port, playing football for the Cheshire schools' team. His father, a former Nottingham Forest player, was wounded in the First World War, and became a bricklayer. He died when Mercer was twelve. After leaving school, Mercer worked for Shell in a variety of unskilled jobs, and played football first for the village of Elton Green and for the Shell Mex team, and later for Ellesmere Port. Spotted at Elton Green by an Everton scout, he played for Everton as an amateur for two years before signing on as a professional in 1931. He became a regular first-team player during the 1935&#150;6 season as a wing-half, and got his first England cap in 1938. He appeared five times for England during the 1938&#150;9 season, in which Everton won the League championship. In September 1939 Mercer joined the army after Stanley Rous, secretary of the Football Association, had circularized footballers urging them to join the Army Physical Training Corps, so that they would keep fit. He became a sergeant-instructor, and ended the Second World War as a sergeant-major. He played in twenty-seven wartime internationals, captaining England on several occasions, and also played for Aldershot. On 3 September 1941 he married Norah Fanny (<i>b</i>. 1919/20), daughter of Albert Edward Dyson, provision merchant. They had one son.<br>
<br>After the war Mercer was unhappy at Everton, and suffered from knee trouble. He was contemplating retirement in order to devote himself to running a grocery business in Wallasey when Arsenal offered &pound;7000 for him in November 1946. He agreed to go on condition that he could live and train in Liverpool, and he continued to do so throughout his eight years with Arsenal. He became a half-back, and went on to captain Arsenal to two League championships, in 1948 and 1953, and to success in the FA cup final against Liverpool in 1950, a few days after being voted Footballer of the Year. In April 1954 he broke his leg, playing against Liverpool, and retired.<br>
<br>For the next twenty years Mercer pursued a successful career as a football manager. He became manager of Sheffield United, who were relegated to the second division at the end of his first season there, in 1955&#151;an inauspicious start. In December 1958 he replaced Eric Houghton as manager of Aston Villa, who were also relegated at the end of the season. But, under his management, Aston Villa came top of the second division in the 1959&#150;60 season, and won the League cup in 1961. Mercer had a nervous breakdown in 1964, after a disappointing season when the club came nineteenth in the League championship, and he resigned.<br>
<br>Mercer was out of football for fourteen months before becoming manager of Manchester City in 1965. He brought in Malcolm Allison as assistant manager and coach, and for five seasons this was a highly successful partnership. Manchester City came top of the second division in Mercer's first season there, won the League championship in 1968 and the FA cup in 1969, and in 1970 won both the League cup and the European Cupwinners' cup, beating the Polish team Gornik Zabrze 2&#150;1 in the final. It was the first English club to win a domestic and a European trophy in the same season. Mercer's relationship with Allison soured after Allison, ambitious for promotion, became involved in boardroom intrigues, and Mercer left in 1972 to become manager of Coventry City. In May 1974, after the resignation of Sir Alf Ramsey, the England manager, Mercer agreed to be caretaker manager for the rest of the season. He was in charge for seven matches, with a record of three wins, three draws, and one loss. He was appointed OBE in 1976.<br>
<br>Mercer was regarded as the greatest wing-half of his generation, and had the Second World War not interrupted his career he would have won many more England caps. As a manager, his greatest successes were with Manchester City, previously overshadowed by their neighbours and rivals, Manchester United. He was a popular manager, much loved for his amiable manner and his big smile. He was famous for his bandy legs and was often mistaken for the jockey Joe Mercer. Mercer died of Alzheimer's disease on 9 August 1990 at his home in St Margaret's Road, Hoylake, Wirral, Cheshire. He was cremated at Landican five days later after a funeral service at Hoylake parish church.<br>
