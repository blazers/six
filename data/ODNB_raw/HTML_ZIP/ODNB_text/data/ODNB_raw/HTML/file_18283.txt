<span class="headword">Mason,  John</span>  (1706&#150;1763), <span class="occ">Independent minister and author</span>, was born at Dunmow, Essex, the son of John Mason (1677&#150;1723), an Independent minister. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18282/', "John Mason (1646?&#150;1694)")</script>, vicar of Water Stratford, Buckinghamshire, the millenarian and hymn writer. He began his training for the ministry under John Jennings at Hinckley about 1722, but this was probably completed in London following Jennings's death in 1723. In the mid-1720s he became private tutor and chaplain to the family of John Feake, for several years governor of Bengal, at his seat near Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Mason commenced his first ministry in 1729 at West Street Independent Chapel in Dorking, Surrey, where on 10 April 1732 he married Mary Walters, daughter of the Revd James Walters of Uxbridge, Middlesex. He was pressed to move to a ministry at Uxbridge in 1744, but declined the offer.<br>
<br>In September 1746, however, Mason accepted the call to follow John Oakes as minister of the large congregation meeting at Crossbrook, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, which had been formed in 1733 by a union of Presbyterians and Independents. He had come into prominence the previous year with the publication of his <span class="italic">Treatise on Self-Knowledge</span>, which quickly became one of the most popular works of moral advice and self-help of its time, with a popular appeal that lasted into the following century. By 1836 it had gone through more than twenty editions, both in Britain and America, and had been translated into Welsh and several European languages. Many of the later editions varied greatly from the original version. It was &#145;esteemed by able and impartial judges, as one of the most useful treatises on practical piety that was ever written in English, or perhaps in any language&#146;  (Good, 9). In consideration of this book and his <span class="italic">Plea for Christianity</span> (1733) Mason was awarded an MA degree by Edinburgh University. This was probably conferred between 1746 and 1749 when the names were not recorded, as his name does not appear in the list of Edinburgh graduates.<br>
<br>Mason was considered a sound but not outstanding preacher. &#145;In the pulpit he pleased by a grave simplicity, but never rose to the higher excellencies of a preacher&#146;  (Bogue and Bennett, 2.590). His theological views, presented with a quiet determination, were conservative rather than radical, though he studiously avoided controversy. However, in private he was a lively conversationalist and expressed himself differently: &#145;his early works show that he was a believer in the trinity, which however he gave up some years before his death&#146;  (Good, 23).<br>
<br>While at Cheshunt, Mason prepared young men for the ministry, who had the benefit of his wide culture and learning. His attitude to study was encapsulated in <span class="italic">The student and pastor, or, Directions how to attain to eminence and usefulness in those respective characters</span> (1755), his second most popular work. The sound advice he offers is as valid today as it was in the mid-eighteenth century: &#145;Consult your own genius and inclination in the study you intend to pursue. You will else row against the tide, and make no progress that is either comfortable, or creditable to yourself&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Student and Pastor</span>, 22). His success as an author lay in an ability to explain his views in a popular way to an intelligent, if non-expert, eighteenth-century readership. His books on elocution (1748), the power of numbers (1749), and on becoming a minister of religion (1753) all went to several editions, and his sermons for both young and old also appeared in numerous volumes and editions. He published a book of the sayings of his grandfather, together with a memoir, in 1742, the content of which was praised in a foreword by Isaac Watts.<br>
<br>Mason continued in the ministry at Cheshunt until his death there of a chill on 10 February 1763. He was buried in the parish churchyard on 20 February, survived by his wife. His name was inextricably linked with his <span class="italic">Treatise on Self-Knowledge</span>, and his claim to fame rests on the sensible moral advice which he gave, linked with broadly accepted Christian principles. His chief tenet is summed up in the preface to early editions: &#145;The great end of all philosophy, both natural and moral, is to know ourselves and to know God. The highest learning is to be wise, and the greatest wisdom is to be good&#146;.<br>
