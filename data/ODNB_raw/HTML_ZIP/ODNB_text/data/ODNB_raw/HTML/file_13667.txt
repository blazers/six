<span class="headword">Honywood,  Michael</span>  (1596&#150;1681), <span class="occ">dean of Lincoln</span>, was born on 1 October 1596 in the parish of St Helen in London, the sixth son and ninth child of Robert Honywood (1545&#150;1627), esquire, of Charing, Kent, and later of Marks Hall, Essex, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1631), daughter of Sir Thomas Browne of Betchworth Castle, Surrey; he was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13666/', "Mary Honywood (1527&#150;1620)")</script> and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13669/', "Sir Thomas Honywood (1587&#150;1666)")</script>. He was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, graduated BA in January 1615 and proceeded MA in 1618. In 1618, through the patronage of Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, he became fellow of his college. He was ordained deacon in the same year and priest in 1619. He assisted Richard Crakanthorpe with his <span class="italic">Logicae libri quinque</span> (1622), help gratefully acknowledged by the author. He served the university offices of taxor in 1623 and of proctor in 1628. Among the fellows of Christ's during his years of residence were Thomas Bainbridge (master of the college), Henry More, Joseph Mede, and Edward King, whose early death was commemorated by the publication of a collection of verses, including two Latin poems by Honywood, and &#145;Lycidas&#146; by John Milton, a former student of Christ's. Honywood took an active part in the management of the college. He was probably the instigator of the erection of the new fellows' buildings, completed in 1644; he gave money to the project, lent more, and was active in raising funds for it.<br>
<br>In 1636 Honywood proceeded BD and in 1639 he was appointed to the lucrative college living of Kegworth, Leicestershire, but he was exempted from the requirement to reside by his appointment as president, or deputy master, of the college. In January 1643 he crossed to the Low Countries, and by August he was in Leiden. Although Thomas Bainbridge wrote to him in August of that year urging him to return and expressing the wish that Honywood should succeed him as master of Christ's, Honywood remained abroad. During his exile he lived mainly at Utrecht, enjoying the friendship of William Sancroft and devoting himself to the collection of books. The notebook in which he recorded his purchases reveals the breadth of his interests, including theology, politics, travel, antiquities, linguistics, science, and mathematics. He acted as a lending library to the circle of exiled Anglican clergy in the Netherlands, many of whom were writing books of their own. For some time he was able to retain the rectory of Kegworth, employing a curate to carry out his duties there, but by 1649 the benefice was finally sequestered by the Leicester county committee and a new minister, William Moore, appointed.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Honywood returned to England. Some of the fellows of Christ's College vainly petitioned that he might be appointed master, in place of Dr Ralph Cudworth. He was restored to his living of Kegworth, which he held until his death. Although it was necessary for him in 1667 to bring a suit against one Richard Gibson, a Quaker, for non-payment of tithes, the parish was not much frequented by nonconformists and it was reported in 1669 that there was no conventicle there. Honywood gave &pound;20 to the repair of the schoolhouse. On 29 September 1660 the king presented him to the deanery of Lincoln; he was installed in person on 12 October. He proceeded DD in 1661. As dean Honywood set vigorously to work to repair the damage done to the fabric of Lincoln Cathedral and its precincts during the civil war and interregnum, contributing liberally from his own purse. He also acted swiftly to re-establish the long-suspended choral services, and by the end of 1660 vicars and choristers had been appointed. With all English cathedrals in a similar position, skilled musicians were in short supply. In 1663 Honywood brought a Dutch organist, Andreas Hecht, to Lincoln, and in 1666 he was in correspondence with Sancroft, then dean of St Paul's, in search of duly qualified voices for the Lincoln choir at a time when the choir of St Paul's was unemployed as a result of the fire of London. The rebuilding of the ruined houses of the vicars choral and the education of the singing boys also occupied Honywood's attention. He earnestly defended the long-suspended rights of the dean and chapter, resumed the practice of decanal visitations of the prebendal churches and estates, and reasserted the franchises of the close. Honywood's chief work in connection with his cathedral was the erection at his own cost (&pound;780) of the library from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren, on the site of the ruined north walk of the cloister. In this building he placed his extensive collection of books, which he eventually bequeathed to the chapter. The collection contains incunabula, an invaluable series of rare seventeenth-century tracts, and other works on a wide range of subjects and in a great variety of languages. Although the library's collections have continued to grow since his death, Honywood's own books are distinguished by the monogram &#145;MH&#146;.<br>
<br>Besides Sancroft, Honywood's friends included Herbert Thorndike and Samuel Pepys. The latter speaks of him as &#145;a good nature, but a very weak man; yet a Deane and a man in great esteem&#146;, and &#145;a simple priest &hellip; though a good well-meaning man&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 29 June, 6 Aug 1664). Honywood died unmarried at his deanery on 7 September 1681; he was buried in the cathedral. John Walker describes him as &#145;a Holy and Humble Man, and a Living Library for Learning&#146;  (Walker, 2.269).<br>
