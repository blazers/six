<span class="headword">Sterling, Sir  Louis Saul</span>  (1879&#150;1958), <span class="occ">gramophone company manager and industrialist</span>, was born into a Jewish family on 31 May 1879 in New York's Lower East Side, the son of Morris Isaac Sterling, an accountant. Little is known of his childhood beyond his own frequently repeated story of selling newspapers on the streets of New York. If true, then it was in that sphere that he discovered and first developed his natural abilities as a salesman. Later Sterling worked for various New York concerns, before obtaining employment with an import&#150;export company. It was there that he first encountered the record industry, beginning an association that lasted for much of his business life.<br>
<br>The litigious travails of the early American record industry deterred Sterling from entering the business in that country. However, his knowledge of overseas markets, together with important contacts with fellow countrymen already exploiting this new technology in Europe, persuaded him to seek his fortune overseas. In February 1903, with $30 (&pound;6) in his pocket, he left New York to settle in London. Years later, he told George VI that his first night in Britain was spent in the police cells, following an over-ambitious celebration of his arrival in London.<h2>
<a name="Therecordbusiness"></a>The record business</h2>Sterling found employment with the Gramophone and Typewriter Ltd, a venture then developing the disc record trade in Britain, Europe, and Russia. In an interview shortly before his death Sterling recalled how he addressed envelopes and did all sorts of menial jobs before becoming a salesman for the company at &pound;3 per week. At the time, because machine and record prices were significantly lower than those of discs, the cylinder record format dominated the infant British market. In an attempt to challenge this, the Gramophone and Typewriter Ltd in 1904 created a range of cheap disc records, and Sterling was given the task of creating a new catalogue of records from existing and back catalogues. The company's failure to give Sterling a promised senior management position caused him to leave at the end of 1904 and go into business on his own account.<br>
<br>In December 1904 Louis Sterling, in partnership with an American sound engineer, Russell Hunting, formed the Sterling Record Company Ltd to manufacture and sell cylinder records. Hunting created an impressive catalogue of recordings, among which were some of the earliest records by the Irish tenor John McCormack, while Sterling created markets using what later became a hallmark of his business methods&#151;mass advertising. However in 1908, despite a strong domestic and overseas base and a German record company agency, the venture collapsed. The combination of a sharp recession and a switch by key German machine and record manufacturers to the disc format destroyed the European market for cylinder records and the disc format became the industry standard.<br>
<br>To capitalize on this important development in 1909 Sterling formed the Rena Manufacturing Company to manufacture and sell disc records and record players. The players failed to materialize, but a catalogue of records was released from existing and back catalogues of the financially troubled British branch of the American firm, the Columbia Phonograph Company General. The Rena contract gave Columbia's record factory and recording studios a financial lifeline. In the rising market of 1910 Rena Records scored a major success, and later that year Sterling sold the business to Columbia, which he then joined as British sales manager. It said something of the state of Columbia's finances and Sterling's own self-confidence that, initially at least, he was employed on a commission-only basis.<br>
<br>Between 1910 and the outbreak of war in 1914 Sterling established himself as a major figure in the growing European record business. His business acumen and selling skills transformed Columbia's fortunes: its development had previously been hampered by the American parent which used it as a source of ready cash. Under Sterling's management, Columbia published regular lists featuring new records of the latest popular music, music-hall songs by top performers, together with complete operas, symphonies, and other large-scale ensemble pieces. These recordings featured important conductors such as Henry Wood and the young Thomas Beecham. With these catalogues of records, Columbia and the industry as a whole established its position as a new and important medium for disseminating musical culture and the performing arts. The success of Sterling's efforts can be gauged by the fact that in 1914 about one third of British households possessed some form of record player, and, at a time when German manufacturers controlled more than half the British record market, Columbia held more than 15 per cent.<br>
<br>When war was declared in August 1914, Sterling's qualities as an industry leader came to the fore. One immediate effect of the unexpected crisis was the collapse of the record industry as consumers stopped buying luxury goods. Sterling seized the initiative and at the end of August published the first of a series of Columbia war record supplements, each containing new recordings of the latest popular war and patriotic songs. He personally persuaded reluctant wholesalers and dealers, who were convinced that the industry was finished, to take these records and engaged in a massive advertising campaign to sell them. The move proved an overwhelming triumph and was imitated by Sterling's competitors. However, it was thanks to Sterling's bold action that the industry survived its greatest crisis.<h2>
<a name="Integrationoftheindustry"></a>Integration of the industry</h2>The war years enabled Louis Sterling to consolidate his position at the centre of the British record industry. In December 1914 he became Columbia's European general manager, and, although cut off from the company's German branch, he presided over a boom in the British trade. In 1917, in order better to protect the venture's growing assets, the company was incorporated in Britain as the Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd, with Sterling as managing director. The same year saw the acquisition of the Hertford Record Company, which, prior to the war, had been the main British business of the German record company Carl Lindstr&ouml;m AG.<br>
<br>In the decade after the war, the Columbia Graphophone Company, under Sterling's leadership, became the world's most dynamic record company. In 1923 Columbia's American parent found itself once again in the hands of receivers. This gave Sterling the opportunity to arrange a management buy-out of the British and European business. With support from financiers Ernest de Stein and Michael Herbert of Morgan Grenfell (then the British branch of J. P. Morgan, the American merchant bank), Sterling bought the business, and in 1924 achieved a successful flotation of the company's shares on the London stock market. The following year, with Morgan's assistance, Sterling acquired the former American parent, Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc., which he then reorganized and rationalized, installing new management, and turned into a profit-making venture. In 1927 Columbia Phonograph invested in the New York-based Independent Broadcasting Network, which was renamed Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and later became one of America's major broadcast networks. The same year he acquired the Okeh Record Company, with its large jazz and popular music catalogue and roster of star names.<br>
<br>Sterling's purchase of the Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc. began a bout of acquisitions and mergers, which included the German Carl Lindstr&ouml;m AG and the record interests of the French company Path&eacute;. The 1920s was a boom time for the record industry in general, and Columbia in particular. Moves into radio manufacture added new products to the Columbia range, and enhanced the value of what had become on both sides of the Atlantic a glamour stock. At one stage Columbia's 10<i>s</i>. shares traded at &pound;15 each. All of this helped Sterling become a very rich man. By the early 1930s he had integrated much of the world's record industry and was a major electrical goods manufacturer, with worldwide manufacturing and distribution networks and an important research laboratory. He became a naturalized British subject in 1932 and was knighted in the 1937 coronation honours list.<br>
<br>On 17 September 1919 Louis Sterling married Cissie Kandt (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stevens), a widow, at London's Central Synagogue; there were no children of the marriage. The couple set up home at 7 Avenue Road, in London's Regent's Park, where they created a haven for artists, bankers, and men of letters. The Sterlings' Sunday afternoon soir&eacute;es were for decades an important feature of London's artistic life. Louis Sterling held strong socialist beliefs and was a member of the Labour Party. Overlaying all this were equally strong beliefs in egalitarian principles which had more in common with the writings of Thomas Jefferson than those of Karl Marx. He believed in the practical application of his beliefs, which he tested on his fiftieth birthday, in 1929, when he distributed &pound;100,000 of his personal wealth among Columbia employees. Furthermore, he established and endowed a company pension scheme.<h2>
<a name="CreationofEMI"></a>Creation of EMI</h2>Sterling, Herbert, and de Stein developed close links with banker Thomas Lamont, then head of J. P. Morgan, who by 1931 controlled eighty per cent of Columbia's American depository stock, which represented the bulk of the shares in the business. In that year pressure grew to merge Columbia with the Gramophone Company, which was run by Sterling's great rival Alfred Clark, and whose business was also substantially controlled by American interests (notably RCA Victor). Until then Sterling's poor personal relations with Clark (who was also a New York emigr&eacute; who had taken British nationality) made him reluctant to consider such a move. However, under intense pressure from Lamont and Owen D. Young (president of the American General Electric Company) who owned half the shares in RCA Victor, the merger was accomplished.<br>
<br>Sterling became managing director of the new company, Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI), and Clark chairman. In the first three years of its existence, in face of the great depression, EMI made cumulative losses of more than &pound;1 million. For the company to survive, Sterling was forced to undertake a massive rationalization programme of EMI's worldwide manufacturing and distribution network, which was more than halved. He also had to cope with the collapse of the record business (in 1929 the combined forces of Columbia and Gramophone sold 30 million records in Britain; the figure for 1938 was around 5 million), the company's main cash-earning product. He focused EMI's radio manufacturing facilities at the company's Hayes factories, and introduced a new range of products such as refrigerators and electric irons and other domestic appliances. Sterling realized that the market for radios would quickly reach saturation levels. With this in mind he supported Isaac Shoenberg, the director of EMI's central research laboratory, in his development of the 405-line television system. With this new product Sterling believed the company would be in a strong position to exploit the next major innovation in domestic leisure activities. The EMI system of television was adopted by the BBC when, in 1936, it began regular public broadcasting of television in the London area.<br>
<br>During EMI's crisis years, relations between Clark and Sterling deteriorated. They became intolerable when, in 1937, Sterling was knighted (an award Clark coveted). The death of two EMI directors enabled Clark to pack the board with his nominees, and in 1939, amid great bitterness, Sterling was manoeuvred out of the company.<br>
<br>Sterling had important interests outside EMI and was a director of several other companies including Chappell, the music publishers, Harrburger Brooks, manufacturers of piano mechanisms, and Solvent Products, a chemical business. In 1938 he became a director of Mercantile Credit Ltd, and the same year he joined Siegmund Warburg as a founding partner of the merchant bank S. G. Warburg Ltd: interesting appointments for a committed socialist. During the Second World War he became chairman and managing director of A. C. Cosser Ltd, the electrical manufacturers, who also made radar equipment.<h2>
<a name="Privatelife"></a>Private life</h2>In the 1930s, as the Nazis began their persecution of German Jews, Sterling, often surreptitiously, assisted many friends, colleagues, and former business associates escape to safety. Throughout his life Sterling put his beliefs into practice, and became one of Britain's largest individual philanthropists, giving away around &pound;1.5 million in his lifetime, through individual donations and his own charitable trust. The bulk of his estate benefited the many charities, including Jewish ones, which he had created and supported over the years.<br>
<br>In his private life, Sterling was an avid collector of first editions and incunabula, and, two years before his death, he gave London University one of the finest privately owned libraries of its kind. With a substantial endowment, the collection was housed, with his portrait, in the Sterling Library at the University Senate House. In recognition of this gift, he was made a DLitt. Sterling died of a coronary thrombosis and diabetes in St Mary's Hospital, London, on 2 June 1958 at the age of seventy-nine. He was buried on 4 June 1958 in Willesden Jewish cemetery, and a memorial service was held at the Central Synagogue in Portland Street on 3 July 1958. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>A pioneer of the gramophone record, radio, television, and domestic electrical appliance industries, Sir Louis Sterling was a remarkable man. He combined an acute business sense with deeply felt humanitarian beliefs. Faced with hard decisions, he could be ruthless, but, unusually for such a powerful figure, he retained the friendship and affection of business associates, performing artists, and employees alike. It was Sterling's bad luck that Alfred Clark's pettiness forced him to leave the business he had done so much to create. A bigger man than Clark, he attributed his success in business to the skill of finding and retaining able subordinates and allowing them to get on with the job.<br>
