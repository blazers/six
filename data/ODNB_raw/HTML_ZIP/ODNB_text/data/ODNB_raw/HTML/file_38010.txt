<span class="headword">Stirling,  Patrick</span>  (1820&#150;1895), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, on 29 June 1820, the eldest in the family of five sons and two daughters of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26534/', "Revd Robert Stirling (1790&#150;1878)")</script>, a minister in the Church of Scotland, and inventor, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of William Rankine, wine merchant, of Galston. He was educated privately. Engineering was a considerable family influence, his great-grandfather Robert Stirling having built a threshing engine in 1758 and his father having invented the hot-air engine and inspired C. W. Siemens's regenerative furnace for the melting and reheating of steel. In 1837 he was apprenticed to his uncle James S. Stirling at Dundee foundry, where he worked for the next six years and where some locomotives were built for the Arbroath and Forfar Railway which influenced his own later designs.<br>
<br>From 1843 he worked on marine engines with Robert Napier on Clydeside, doing installation work on four early Cunard liners. He joined Neilson &amp; Co. in 1846 at their Hyde Park (Glasgow) works, becoming a foreman in the locomotive construction department. In 1851 he became locomotive superintendent of the small Bowling and Balloch Railway on Loch Lomond, before returning to marine work with Laurence Hill of Port Glasgow. He then joined R. and W. Hawthorn &amp; Co. of Newcastle, a firm which supplied locomotives to the Glasgow and South Western Railway, of which he became locomotive superintendent in 1853. His first task was to select a site for, and to design, new locomotive workshops in Kilmarnock to replace existing inadequate facilities in Glasgow. He then introduced several new locomotive types from 1855 onwards for passenger and freight service, the former being of 2&#150;2&#150;2 type with outside cylinders and inside bearings to all axles. Later examples had boilers without a steam-collecting dome, which strengthened the boiler shell and which characterized all his later locomotives, as well as those of his brother James on the South Eastern Railway and of his son Matthew on the Hull and Barnsley.<br>
<br>In 1866 Stirling succeeded Archibald Sturrock as locomotive superintendent of the Great Northern Railway at Doncaster, and in the next year his 0&#150;4&#150;2 type mixed-traffic locomotive was first introduced, with construction continuing over the next twenty-eight years, as well as the 2&#150;4&#150;0 type for passenger service. However, he considered that only locomotives with a single pair of driving wheels were really suitable for express-train service, and the first of these was built in 1868, followed two years later by the larger 4&#150;2&#150;2 type with outside cylinders and driving wheels 8 feet in diameter, whose simple and elegant outline created great interest. These, and a series of 2&#150;2&#150;2 type machines with inside cylinders, continued to be built until 1895 and hauled the principal express trains. They also pulled those in the railway &#145;races&#146; from London to Edinburgh in 1888 and to Aberdeen in 1895, when there was keen competition between the east and west coast routes; Stirling's locomotives averaged over 60 m.p.h. between London and York. However, the steadily increasing weight of express trains in the 1890s made it obvious that more powerful locomotives would be required.<br>
<br>Stirling was charming if somewhat reserved in manner, and he retained a strong Scottish accent throughout his life. He was a strikingly handsome figure, 6 feet 4 inches in height. He maintained his defence of his 8-foot single locomotives when contemporaries were increasingly convinced that coupled-wheel engines were preferable. He was dedicated to his work and to his men, by whom he was much respected for his design and organizing ability and for his fairness and kindness in cases of individual hardship. During times of recession he did everything possible to avoid making men redundant, preferring that all should work short time. On his seventieth birthday his workmen presented a drinking fountain to the town of Doncaster as a token of their esteem. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and was one of the earliest members of the Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders of Scotland.<br>
<br>The date of Stirling's marriage to Margaret Laird of Port Glasgow is not known; she outlived him. They had four sons, all of whom became railway engineers, and one daughter. Stirling died at his home, Highfield House, Wheatley, near Doncaster, on 11 November 1895 and was buried on 14 November in Doncaster cemetery.<br>
