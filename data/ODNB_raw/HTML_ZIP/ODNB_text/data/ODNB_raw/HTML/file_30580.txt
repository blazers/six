<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barcroft, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1872&#150;1947), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 26 July 1872 at The Glen, Newry, co. Down, Ireland, the second of the five children of Henry Barcroft (<i>d</i>. 1905), linen merchant and inventor, and his wife, Anna Richardson Malcolmson (1840&#150;1924), daughter of David Malcolmson of Melview, Clonnel, co. Tipperary, and his wife, Sarah Nicholson. Barcroft, or J. B., as he was widely known, received his early schooling at home until the age of twelve, and then went to the Friends' school at Bootham, York. He then attended the Leys School in Cambridge. Several of his contemporaries at the school distinguished themselves in later life; among them was H. H. Dale. In his last year at school (1891), Barcroft astonished his friends by passing the BSc degree of London University; however, the effort apparently affected his health to such an extent that he then took a year off.<br>
<br>In 1893 Barcroft went up to King's College, Cambridge, and read for the natural sciences tripos, obtaining first-class honours in part one in 1896, and part two (physiology) in 1897. Among his contemporaries were E. Rutherford and H. H. Dale, both of whom became fellows, and later presidents, of the Royal Society. At a meeting of the Natural Sciences Club, Barcroft demonstrated what may have been the first X-ray photograph produced in England.<br>
<br>Barcroft began a research programme in the Cambridge Physiological Laboratory in 1897 and continued this, with occasional interruptions, throughout his entire life. His first project was on the effect of stimulation of the nerves to the submaxillary gland, and particularly the resulting oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output in the gland. This work sparked his interest in blood gases and led to his development of a differential blood-gas manometer. Over the next few years he collaborated with J. S. Haldane on blood-gas analysis, with T. G. Brodie on the kidney, with E. H. Starling on the pancreas, and with W. E. Dixon on the heart. The focus of all these projects was the gaseous metabolism of these organs. Barcroft gained the Walsingham medal in 1899 and was awarded a prize fellowship and appointed lecturer at King's College. In 1904 he was made junior demonstrator in the physiological laboratory, and three years later he was promoted to senior demonstrator.<br>
<br>In 1903 Barcroft married Mary Agnetta (Minnie) Ball (1875&#150;1961), daughter of the astronomer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30566/', "Sir Robert Ball")</script>, who was a professorial fellow at King's College. They lived at 13 Grange Road, which became a popular meeting place for friends and visiting scientists from all over the world. They had two sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69107/', "Henry Barcroft (1904&#150;1998)")</script>, who became a fellow of the Royal Society and professor of physiology at St Thomas's Hospital, London, and Robert Ball Barcroft, who became an army officer.<br>
<br>Barcroft's early work on blood gases was the beginning of a lifelong interest in haemoglobin, and particularly its combination with oxygen. Aspects which he studied included the effects of temperature, carbon dioxide pressure, acidity, salts, dialysis, diet, exercise, and high altitude. The last prompted him to participate in two high-altitude expeditions, one to Tenerife in 1910 and another to Monte Rosa in 1911. His studies on haemoglobin culminated in his classic book <span class="italic">The Respiratory Function of the Blood</span>, which was published in 1914. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1910. During the same year he became assistant tutor at King's and also proctor of the university.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 posed a dilemma for Barcroft, as his family had been members of the Society of Friends since the seventeenth century. He resolved the issue by working on medical and physiological effects of gas poisoning, both at Cambridge and at the government's experimental station at Porton Down, Wiltshire. He claimed that as a civilian he could be much more assertive to the military top brass. C. G. Douglas, who was in the RAMC, recounts an anecdote concerning Barcroft's visit to an advanced dressing station near the French lines, which was within the range of the German guns. Barcroft insisted on standing prominently on a crossroads but no shells were fired, possibly because he was wearing his bowler hat, and this may have unsettled the gunners. During his time at Porton Barcroft took part in an enterprising experiment, when he exposed himself and a dog to hydrocyanic acid in a closed chamber. The animal nearly died, but Barcroft was unaffected, a dramatic demonstration of how different species vary in their response to toxic gases. He was appointed CBE in 1918 for his services during the war.<br>
<br>In 1919 Barcroft returned to Cambridge as reader, and developed his interest in high-altitude physiology, in particular the issue of whether the lungs actively secreted oxygen, as claimed by J. S. Haldane in Oxford, and earlier by Christian Bohr in Copenhagen. In 1911 Haldane had led an expedition to Pike's peak, Colorado, where strong evidence for oxygen secretion was apparently obtained. Barcroft tested this in a famous experiment in 1920, when he placed himself in a glass box for six days, while the oxygen concentration was gradually reduced until it was equivalent to the oxygen pressure at an altitude substantially above Pike's peak. Blood was drawn from his radial artery using the newly developed technique of arterial cannulation, and there was a dramatic moment when the first blood came out blue rather than red, indicating that oxygen secretion by the lungs was not occurring. Subsequent careful measurements confirmed this.<br>
<br>In 1921&#150;2 Barcroft led a high-altitude expedition to Cerro de Pasco in Peru, in order to study pulmonary gas exchange, blood biochemistry, and several other topics. In the report of this, he commented on the extraordinary athletic ability of the permanent residents of Cerro, but added that they had &#145;impaired physical and mental powers&#146; compared to sea-level dwellers. This remark incensed the Peruvian physician Carlos Monge, who subsequently embarked on an extensive study of the high-altitude dwellers. It could be argued that this influential Peruvian school owed its origin to Barcroft's report and possibly to this single unguarded statement. These high-altitude interests culminated in &#145;Lessons from high altitudes&#146;, the first part of the second edition of <span class="italic">The Respiratory Function of the Blood</span>, which was published in 1925 and became a classic. Barcroft became professor of physiology at Cambridge in the same year.<br>
<br>Another period in Barcroft's research began when he worked on the storage organs of the blood, particularly the spleen. Much of this research was done on dogs in which the organ had been exteriorized by operation, so that it could be directly inspected through a window. This was also a period when Barcroft organized a substantial extension of the Cambridge Physiological Laboratory, with the result that it became one of the most impressive physiological institutions in the country. He also paid several visits to the United States, and a series of lectures to the Harvard medical school was published in 1934 in his famous book, <span class="italic">Features in the Architecture of Physiological Functions</span>, which is remarkable for the breadth of its scholarship.<br>
<br>A final period of research, which included a short spell at Porton at the outbreak of the Second World War, occupied Barcroft's time between 1932 and 1947. His primary focus was now on foetal physiology, and he left an indelible impression on this field. The topics he investigated included blood volume, placental blood flow, the physiology of the foetal heart, both foetal and maternal haemoglobin, and metabolism and growth <i>in utero</i>. This work was brought together in Barcroft's last book, <span class="italic">Researches in Pre-Natal Life</span>, the first volume of which was published only a few weeks before his death.<br>
<br>Barcroft was knighted in 1935. He delivered the Croonian lecture on &#145;Foetal respiration&#146; to the Royal Society in the same year, and the Linacre lecture at Cambridge in 1941 on &#145;Respiratory patterns at birth&#146;. By this time he was head of the Agricultural Research Council unit in animal physiology at Cambridge. In 1943 he was awarded the Copley medal of the Royal Society; he had already won its royal medal in 1922. Barcroft, who loved sailing, riding, and golf, died suddenly in Barton Road, Cambridge, on 21 March 1947. He was cremated, following a service at King's College chapel, on 25 March. In 1952 Mount Barcroft, a peak in the White Mountains, California, was named in his honour.<br>
