<span class="headword">Pattinson, Sir  (William) Derek</span>  (1930&#150;2006), <span class="occ">church administrator and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 31 March 1930 at Risedale Maternity Home, Barrow in Furness, Lancashire, the only child of Thomas William Pattinson (<i>d</i>. 1970), a clerk in the Ministry of Labour and later a tax inspector, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burgess (<i>d</i>. 1986), a schoolmistress. He was educated at Whitehaven grammar school; this was followed by national service in the Royal Air Force, where he did not distinguish himself, staying in the lowest rank. He won an exhibition to Queen's College, Oxford, and was awarded the Stanhope historical essay prize in 1951. After graduating with a second-class degree the following year he entered the home civil service and served in the inland revenue department at Somerset House in London from 1952 until 1970. During that time he was seconded on two occasions (1962&#150;5 and 1968&#150;70) to the Treasury.<br>
<br>Pattinson (who always used the name Derek rather than William) was a prominent member of the William Temple Association, serving for a time as its chairman, and in that capacity he came to the notice of Archbishop Michael Ramsey, who in 1966 invited him to become a member of the church and state commission chaired by Owen Chadwick. Pattinson was one of the more radical members of the commission, pressing for the church rather than the prime minister to have the final say in episcopal appointments.<br>
<br>When in 1970 it was decided to replace the church assembly with a general synod Pattinson was an obvious candidate to follow Sir John Guillum Scott as secretary-general. He was persuaded to apply for the post much against the advice of his mother, who considered that he would become a permanent secretary if he stayed in the civil service. He did not heed her advice and was appointed associate secretary-general in 1970, becoming secretary-general on Scott's retirement in 1972. It proved to be an inspired appointment. Pattinson devoted all his energies to establishing the new general synod, ensuring that it had a high profile with the media. Without doubt he was the most influential layman in the church during his period of office. In its first twenty years the synod dealt with many controversial matters that often put the synod&#151;and the church&#151;at odds with the government of the day; <span class="italic">The Church and the Bomb</span> (1982) and <span class="italic">Faith in the City</span> (1985) were two reports that placed the general synod in the media spotlight and caused annoyance to the administration of Margaret Thatcher.<br>
<br>During James Callaghan's time as prime minister the synod resolved to tackle the question of bishops' appointments and, with Pattinson as part of the negotiating group, concessions were made by Downing Street on the lines of the proposals of the Chadwick report. This gave satisfaction to Pattinson, who was now seen as a skilful political operator, but within the church he had critics who considered that he had too much power. Ramsey's successor at Canterbury, Donald Coggan, relied to a large extent on his own staff at Lambeth and consultation with Pattinson and his colleagues at Church House was kept to a minimum. This caused difficulties for Pattinson but a better relationship developed when Robert Runcie became archbishop in 1980.<br>
<br>One of the most difficult events in Pattinson's career occurred in 1987 when Canon Gareth Bennett of New College, Oxford, was commissioned by Pattinson and his opposite number in the church commissioners to write the anonymous preface to <span class="italic">Crockford's Clerical Directory</span>, published annually by Oxford University Press. The preface contained paragraphs that were highly critical of Runcie's appointment of liberals to bishoprics and deaneries. The media clamoured for the author's identity. Pattinson refused to name him but others pointed the finger at Bennett, who denied authorship. Media attention became too much for Bennett and he committed suicide. Some called for Pattinson's resignation over the affair but the archbishop stood by him and he weathered the storm. Speaking in the general synod when Pattinson retired in 1990, Runcie said &#145;Where the Synod is, there is Derek; where Derek is, there is the Synod. It is not too much to say that Derek has been married to the Synod, and has loved and cherished it even in its most unpopular moments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of Proceedings of the General Synod</span>, July 1990). Pattinson was knighted on retirement.<br>
<br>In the early 1980s Pattinson's widowed mother moved to London and he was very attentive to her needs; there was a close bond between them. She died suddenly and Pattinson was much affected. Always a person who enjoyed the good things of life&#151;he was a City liveryman and a freemason&#151;it was noticed that he was drinking more and keeping questionable company. However, he followed his vocation to the priesthood and was ordained deacon by the bishop of London, Graham Leonard, in 1991. He became an honorary assistant curate at St Gabriel's, Pimlico, and was ordained priest the following year by Leonard's successor, David Hope. Unusually, he was allowed to call himself the Revd Sir Derek Pattinson, since he had been knighted before being ordained priest. He proved to be an excellent preacher and a good pastor although his liturgical sense was not so well developed. About this time a gay rights activist and former member of the general synod, Barnaby Kemp Graham Miln, moved into Pattinson's Westminster flat, causing some scandal when this was revealed by the newspapers. Miln later nursed Pattinson when the latter's health deteriorated, until it was necessary for him to have professional care. He died on 10 October 2006 at St Johns Wood Care Centre, Camden, London, of dementia and obstructive hydrocephalus, and was cremated on 7 November. He was survived by Barnaby Miln, who was described in Pattinson's final <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry as his partner.<br>
