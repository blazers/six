<span class="headword">Booth,  Abraham</span>  (1734&#150;1806), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and author</span>, was born at Blackwell, near Alfreton, Derbyshire, on 20 May 1734, the son of Robert Booth (<i>bap</i>. 1700) and Elizabeth Bradley. While an infant his parents moved to Annesley Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, where his father had taken a small farm as a tenant of the duke of Portland. As the eldest of a large family he assisted them until his sixteenth year, during which time he was never at school for longer than six months, but on leaving farm labour for the stocking-frame trade he was able to support himself and get some further elementary education. On reaching his twenty-fourth year he married Elizabeth Bowmar (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1804), a farmer's daughter, and soon afterwards he opened a school at Sutton in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>Early in life the preaching of some evangelical General Baptists awakened in Booth a sense of religion, and in 1755 he was baptized by immersion and began preaching in the east midlands. In 1760 he became superintendent of the Kirkby Woodhouse congregation, but declined to be their pastor. Up to this point he had been a strenuous advocate of Arminian doctrines and, when twenty years old, had written a poem on &#145;Absolute Predestination&#146;, but he now changed his views to the Calvinistic doctrines held by the Particular Baptists, and accordingly seceded. This change took place at the same time as he was in contact with ministers from the Northamptonshire Association such as Sutcliff, Fuller, Ryland, and the younger Hall. Soon after he began to preach on Sundays at Sutton in Ashfield, Chesterfield, and other east midland towns and villages, and kept his school, which was his only source of income, during the rest of the week. At this period he composed <span class="italic">The Reign of Grace</span> (1768; 2nd edn, 1771). Henry Venn, author of the <span class="italic">Complete Duty of Man</span>, read this work in manuscript and as a consequence travelled to Nottinghamshire to see him, a meeting which resulted in a lifelong friendship. Venn wrote the prefaces to both the first and second editions. Soon after its publication, the Particular Baptist church of Little Prescot Street, Goodman's Fields, London, invited Booth to be their pastor. He accepted the call and was ordained on 16 February 1769.<br>
<br>In 1770 Booth published <span class="italic">The Death of Legal Hope, the Life of Evangelical Obedience</span> as a supplement to <span class="italic">The Reign of Grace</span>, which was directed against the extremes of Arminianism and antinomianism. Theologically he was closer to the hyper-Calvinists than to Andrew Fuller, the leading Particular Baptist theologian of the day, whom he accused of abandoning true Calvinism. The hyper-Calvinists adhered to a theological system that emphasized the sovereignty of God in the work of salvation, yet ignored or denied man's responsibility. He was nevertheless a fervent and loyal supporter of the Baptist Missionary Society, one of the few London ministers to be so. He was active also in believing the gospel contained a complete warrant for the ungodly to believe in Jesus Christ, and this was the theme of his <span class="italic">Glad Tidings to Perishing Sinners</span> (1796). A strong opponent of infant baptism and open communion, his <span class="italic">Paedobaptism Examined</span> (1784), written as an answer to the posthumous work of the celebrated Matthew Henry, brought him into conflict with Edward Williams (1750&#150;1813).<br>
<br>Booth died in London on 27 January 1806 aged seventy-one, having been a minister for fifty years. He was buried in the Maze Pond church burial-ground, London, and a marble tablet was erected to his memory in the Little Prescot Street church. His wife had died about four years before him, and he was survived by several children. Booth was a man of strong muscular frame and of sound constitution, whose private life was distinguished by purity and kindness. A female member of his church once left him a handsome legacy but, on finding that there were poor relations of hers still living, he went to the Bank of England and transferred the whole amount to them. Unostentatious and a man of simple tastes, he hated flattery and deceit. He was a firm believer in religious liberty, though somewhat dogmatic in stating his own view, particularly in later years. His early experiences gave him a sound understanding of men and affairs, but his eager mind was always handicapped by his lack of real education. This gave him a concern for ministerial education, which in turn led to the formation of the Baptist Education Society in 1804. This interest he pursued vigorously with help from William Newman, the pastor of a church in Bow, and two of his own deacons, William Taylor and Joseph Gutteridge. After his death the Education Society became the Stepney Academy and, later still, moved to Oxford, where it became Regent's Park College.<br>
