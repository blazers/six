<span class="headword">Mackarell <span class="st"> [Makkarell]</span>,  Matthew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537), <span class="occ">abbot of Barlings</span>, was probably of Scottish descent, and born to parents in the service of the first duke of Norfolk. He had entered the Premonstratensian abbey of Cockersand in Lancashire as a novice by 1497, and was professed as a canon, ordained priest, and appointed sacristan there by 1500. He clearly asked for a licence to study at Cambridge, to which he went early in the sixteenth century, and had obtained his BTh degree by 1510. From Cambridge he probably proceeded to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he gained his doctorate in theology before returning to England about 1516. By 1519 he was abbot of Alnwick, Northumberland, and by 1529 of Barlings, Lincolnshire. By 1524, he was a bishop-suffragan first in the diocese of York, then of Lincoln, with the title of bishop of Chalcedon.<br>
<br>Mackarrell's was not the quiet life that his bare biographical details suggest. He was the chosen preacher (perhaps because of a family affiliation) at the funeral of the second duke of Norfolk in May 1524, and such was his sermon on death that the congregation was said to have fled the church, leaving it to the preacher and the corpse. As abbot of Barlings he played a somewhat ambiguous role in the Lincolnshire rebellion of 1536, itself the precursor to the Pilgrimage of Grace. He would later claim that the common people intimidated him, but in view of his previous record that is unlikely, and clearly he regarded the dissolution of the lesser monasteries in 1536 as daylight robbery. Accordingly, he seems to have taken precautions to dispose of some of the wealth of his house, sensing that it would not be too long before the greater monasteries went the way of the lesser. There is much evidence to suggest that he provided the rebels with food and hospitality. He was accused by Edward Dymock and other gentlemen that on &#145;dyvers tymes&#146; he had urged the rebels &#145;to goo forwarde&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 36/118, p. 1). It seems unlikely that he was uninvolved, but some of the accusations against him by interested parties, notably that he had plundered the house of John Freeman, are improbable. The anticlericalism of the courts he faced at Lincoln and London, and the suggestion of Scottish ancestry possibly conveyed by his name and early residence near the border, may have made Mackerell a man of few friends. In any event, he was executed as a traitor at Tyburn on 29 March 1537 and buried the same day at Pardon churchyard, London. Judged by the letter of the law he appears to have been guilty; had he not been a canon, probably a Scot, and a theologian, he might have fared better.<br>
