<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dove,  Thomas</span>  (1555&#150;1630), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough</span>, was born in London, the son of William Dove. He was a scholar at Merchant Taylors' School between 1564 and 1571, whence he proceeded to Pembroke College, Cambridge, as a Watts scholar, graduating BA in 1575 and MA in 1578. In 1575 he was nominated one of the first scholars at Jesus College, Oxford, but preferred to remain at Pembroke as <i>tanquam socius</i> (equivalent to a fellow), having come second in the competition for the sole vacant fellowship to his illustrious contemporary at Merchant Taylors' and Pembroke Lancelot Andrewes. Dove was ordained deacon and priest by Bishop Cox of Ely on 21 December 1578, and became vicar of Saffron Walden, Essex, in 1580 on the presentation of the crown; he was rector of the college living of Framlingham from 1584 until his death, and briefly vicar of Heydon in Essex (1586&#150;8). About this time he married Margaret, daughter of Oliver Warner of Eversden, Cambridgeshire; they had three daughters and two sons, the older being William, later knighted, and the younger Thomas, baptized in 1587, who later became archdeacon of Northampton and predeceased his father.<br>
<br>Dove's further preferment owed much to his preaching, which so impressed Elizabeth I that she remarked after first hearing him that &#145;she thought the Holy Ghost was discended againe in this Dove&#146;  (Harington, 147&#150;8). He became a royal chaplain, preaching three times before the queen in Lent 1586, and occupying the Good Friday slot from 1590 to 1601. In 1589 he became dean of Norwich, being installed on 16 June. Here he worked with local gentry against patentees for concealed lands, which resulted in 1593 in the statutory confirmation of the possessions of the dean and chapter; his appointment as a JP in 1591 was one mark of his local standing, and another followed in 1602, when seven local gentlemen wrote to Sir Robert Cecil requesting that Dove fill the vacant bishopric of Norwich. By this time Dove had left East Anglia, however, having been consecrated bishop of Peterborough on 26 April 1601. He was to remain at Peterborough for the rest of his life, despite lobbying the earls of Suffolk and Northampton for promotion to Lincoln in 1608. Also in 1601, he received the local living of Polebrooke to augment his slender income.<br>
<br>The accession of James I was probably the major reason why Dove rose no higher. He was one of nine bishops to attend the Hampton Court conference in January 1604, but his only recorded contribution, on lay baptism, provoked the king's scorn. When Dove cited a patristic source that in case of necessity sand might be used instead of water, James retorted with &#145;a turd for the argument, he might as well have pissed on them&#146;  (Usher, 2.342). In the winter of 1604&#150;5, as James enforced conformity on puritan clergy, Dove misread the signals and deprived sixteen ministers, more than any other diocesan, and had to defend his conduct to the privy council, pleading that his diocese was &#145;the nest and nursery of factious ministers&#146; and that those he had ejected were of &#145;such invincible obstinacy, as never any bishop met with&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 17.46&#150;7, 58&#150;9). He then faced the embarrassment of a petition from forty-five Northamptonshire gentry to the king against the deprivations. Dove's vigour against nonconformists also betrayed his anti-puritanism, and in his early years at Peterborough he assembled a team of proto-Arminian officials, among them Richard Butler, John Buckeridge, and John Lambe, his chancellor in 1615&#150;16 and later Archbishop William Laud's dean of the arches.<br>
<br>Dove had learned caution from the events of 1604&#150;5, however, and in any case he had to co-operate with the puritan gentry in the workings of local government. In 1611 and 1614 he was rebuked by Archbishop George Abbot, acting on royal orders, for his indulgence to intransigent nonconformists; earlier, in 1611, Dove also had to assure the privy council that he had not been negligent in tendering the oath of allegiance to Roman Catholics. This impression of a somewhat slack administration in the years after 1605 is no doubt heightened by the chance survival of such letters in Lambe's archive among the state papers, but independent evidence, such as Dove's rather casual practices at ordination (a significant number of his ordinands were later ejected for nonconformity), points in the same direction. Nevertheless Dove was active in diocesan affairs, regularly leading his triennial visitations and preaching to his clergy, and until about 1616 hearing disciplinary cases in his consistory or audience court. No fewer than nine different sets of his visitation articles are extant, and are remarkable for the regular revisions that he or his chancellor made to them.<br>
<br>Dove resided at Peterborough Palace, making occasional forays to the Jacobean court in order to preach, again with some applause&#151;a sermon delivered in August 1605 won praise from many, including Queen Anne. He played some part in secular affairs too, attending the commission of sewers, especially in 1618&#150;21, a time of controversial projects to drain the fens. But as the 1620s progressed he took less part in local affairs, delegated his visitations of 1626 and 1629, and missed the parliaments of 1624, 1625, 1626, and 1628&#150;9. Dove composed his will in August 1626, leaving bequests to his large family, including &pound;500 for the education of five grandchildren, and appointing his son Sir William Dove of Upton, Northamptonshire, as his executor. His wife had predeceased him. He died on 30 August 1630 and was buried in Peterborough Cathedral, where a monument, demolished in 1643, was erected to his memory.<br>
