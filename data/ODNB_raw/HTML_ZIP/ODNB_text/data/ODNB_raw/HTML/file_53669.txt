<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1594/5?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1659), <span class="occ">astrologer and medical practitioner</span>, was of Welsh origin. He was well educated and had obtained an MA degree by 1621. He was probably the John Evans of Flint who matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1615, aged twenty, and proceeded BA the following year; though several namesakes attended Oxford in this period, this is the most likely identification. Evans became a minister, serving probably in the diocese of Worcester and later as curate of Enfield, Staffordshire, where his name occurs between 1620 and 1625.<br>
<br>In 1625, when he was living at Four Ashes, Enfield, Evans offered tuition in English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, writing, and mathematics. He published an almanac for 1613, calculated for Worcester and dedicated to the bishop of Worcester (Henry Parry), and others for 1625 and 1629&#150;31, calculated for Shrewsbury. They contain pious exhortations in verse, extracts from Du Bartas's <span class="italic">Divine Weeks</span>, and astrological advice. His <span class="italic">The Palace of Profitable Pleasure</span> (1621), dedicated to James I, was a simple dictionary and grammar with arithmetical tables, while his <span class="italic">The Sacrifice of a Contrite Heart</span> (1630), a book of prayers and meditations, utilized some of his almanac material and included prayers for the conversion of the Jews and the overthrow of the Roman Antichrist.<br>
<br>In 1633 Evans published an <span class="italic">Ephemerides</span> for five years, based on the tables of David Origanus. About 1630 he was forced to flee Enfield &#145;for some Offences very scandalous&#146; and settled in London, first in the Minories, in Aldgate, then in Gunpowder Alley near Fetter Lane, where he scraped a living by practising astrology and chemical medicine. In 1632 a friend took the young William Lilly to meet him as &#145;an excellent wise man&#146; in astrology. Lilly describes finding him living in squalor and in bed with a hangover, &#145;if it be lawful to call that a Bed whereon he lay&#146;. None the less he agreed to teach Lilly astrology, and did so very effectively for seven or eight weeks despite a library comprising only two books. Lilly later penned a vivid portrait of his tutor: &#145;of a middle Stature, broad Forehead, Beetle-brow'd, thick Shoulders, flat Nosed, full Lips, down-look'd, black curling stiff Hair, splay-footed&#146;, dishonest, and &#145;much addicted to Debauchery, and then very abusive and quarrelsom, seldom without a black Eye, or one Mischief or another&#146;  (Lilly, 21). They parted company when Evans gave a blatantly false resolution to a client, observing cynically that &#145;he had a Wife and Family to provide for&#146;  (Lilly, 23).<br>
<br>Though a rogue, Evans was no impostor. Lilly admired his &#145;piercing Judgment&#146;  (Lilly, 21) and Richard Napier thought Evans his superior in some branches of the art. Evans also practised the invocation of spirits, both in Staffordshire and London. On one occasion, he told Lilly, he raised a spirit at the request of Sir Kenelm Digby and was transported bodily from the Minories to a field near Battersea. Evans's daughter Ellen also practised the invocation of spirits. A considerable part of Evans's income came from his antimonial cups, which he promoted in <span class="italic">The Universal Medicine, or, The Vertues of the Antimoniall Cup</span> (1634). He claimed to have used his cup safely for three years, citing Sir Thomas Myddelton, a former lord mayor, as proof of its virtues. However, some abusive remarks about the eminent physician Sir Th&eacute;odore de Mayerne brought Evans to the attention of the College of Physicians of London, and on hearing that two of Evans's patients (Sir Nathaniel Kitch and Lady Amy Blunt) had died of severe vomiting, it ruled that he was a dangerous charlatan. The college pressed Archbishop Laud to take action, and on Laud's orders all remaining copies of Evans's book were seized and destroyed. Laud also summoned him before the court of high commission in June 1635, where he proved unable to produce his holy orders and was detained for behaving &#145;contemptuously&#146;. The case dragged on until November, when Evans was discharged on promising not to practise medicine in or near London.<br>
<br>Little is known of Evans's later years. He is said by Anthony Wood, very plausibly, to have &#145;lived in several places, and in obscure conditions&#146;  (Wood). He may be the John Evans intruded as rector of Yeovilton, Somerset, in 1647. In 1659 he surfaced as rector of Littleton upon Severn, Gloucestershire, announcing in a London newspaper that his cup was still much in demand and could be obtained through a relative in the capital. Nothing more is heard of him after this date.<br>
