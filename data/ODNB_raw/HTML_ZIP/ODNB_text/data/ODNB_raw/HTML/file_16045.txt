<span class="headword">Langton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1501), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester and archbishop-elect of Canterbury</span>, was born at Appleby in Westmorland. The terms of his will imply that the year of his birth was about 1430. He had graduated MA at Cambridge by 1456 and was a fellow of Pembroke College by 1462&#150;3, when he served as senior proctor of the university. He vacated his fellowship in 1464 to study at Padua, but soon returned to Cambridge because of a shortage of funds, and was admitted BTh in 1465. During his second stay in Italy (1468&#150;73) Langton was created DCnL at Bologna in 1473 and DTh by 1476.<br>
<br>Langton's first benefice may have been the rectory of Seaham, Durham, which he held by May 1473. Described as a royal chaplain, he became a canon of Crediton briefly in November 1477, and on 18 February 1478 was collated to the treasurership of Exeter, at the king's nomination. In January 1478 he was appointed to a canonry and prebend in Wells, and in 1479 the king presented him to the rectory of Pembridge in Herefordshire, which he continued to hold until 1485. He was given the rectory of All Hallows, Bread Street, by the archbishop of Canterbury on 1 July 1480, and the rectory of All Hallows Gracechurch by the prior of Canterbury in May 1482. He was also a canon of Lincoln. On 4 July 1483 Langton was papally provided to the bishopric of St David's at the request of the protector, Richard, duke of Gloucester, who had already given him custody of the temporalities. Langton was consecrated on 7 September. As king, Richard secured Langton's translation to the more valuable see of Salisbury early in 1485. The temporalities had been in Langton's custody since March 1484, Bishop Lionel Woodville being then an attainted traitor in sanctuary.<br>
<br>Langton's experience of travel on the continent doubtless proved invaluable at the outset of his secular career as a diplomat. In November 1476, and again in March 1477, Edward IV appointed him to go to Castile to explore a possible marriage between the prince of Wales and the Infanta Isabella. In November 1477 and March 1478 he went to France, to try to dissuade Louis XI from his proposed attack on Burgundy. On 26 August 1478 Langton was empowered to conclude with the king of France the betrothal of Edward IV's eldest daughter, Elizabeth, with the dauphin, and was reappointed to this fruitless project in May 1479 and August 1480. Edward IV also employed Langton on missions to Maximilian, duke of Austria and later emperor, in 1480&#150;81. On 29 February 1484 Richard III appointed Langton his proctor to the curia to swear obedience to the pope, and on 21 March empowered him to negotiate a truce with Charles VIII of France. When he was not on embassy Langton was busy at court, and he accompanied Richard III on his progress in August 1483, during which he wrote a celebrated letter to the prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, in praise of the new king, declaring that &#145;God hath sent him to us for the weal of us all&#146;  (Ross, 151).<br>
<br>According to a privy seal warrant sealed on 6 October 1485 Langton forfeited his temporalities as bishop of Salisbury by his adherence to Richard III at Bosworth; however, on 6 November he was granted full pardon and restitution of his lands and revenues, and by the end of the month he was exercising his episcopal patronage unimpeded. He immersed himself in the administration of his diocese, being particularly assiduous in his efforts to eradicate Lollard heresy, both at Salisbury and later at Winchester, visiting the royal court only when summoned to parliament or convocation. Having been excluded from Henry VII's first parliament in 1485, he was summoned to the next, in November 1487, and to all subsequent parliaments until his death. Also in November 1487 he was appointed to the commission of the peace for Wiltshire; he served in this capacity for Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Surrey until his death. In December 1487 he was elected provost of Queen's College, Oxford. The most convincing proof that Langton had gained the confidence of Henry VII is provided by his translation, early in 1493, to the see of Winchester, the richest in England. But he continued to shun the court, and occupied himself with diocesan administration and the rebuilding of the palace at Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire. When Cardinal Morton died on 15 September 1500, Henry VII secured Langton's election as archbishop of Canterbury on 22 January 1501, but only two or three days later Langton fell ill with plague, and on 27 January he died.<br>
<br>The text of Langton's will, dated 25 January, runs to more than one hundred items. His money legacies amount to upwards of &pound;2000, including the provision of six exhibitions in Queen's College, Oxford, and more than a dozen other benefactions to the universities. Richard Pace (<i>d</i>. 1536), the future diplomat and dean of St Paul's, who had been sent as a young man to study at Padua at Langton's expense, remembered that the bishop &#145;befriended all learned men exceedingly, and in his time was another Maecenas, rightly remembering (as he often said), that it was for learning that he had been promoted to the rank of bishop&#146;  (Wegg, 4&#150;5). He also advanced the fortunes of his nephews <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16042/', "Robert Langton (1470&#150;1524)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1081/', "Christopher Bainbridge (1462/3&#150;1514)")</script>&#151;the latter was subsequently appointed cardinal-archbishop of York. Thomas Langton is buried in the richly decorated chantry chapel he had built at the east end of the south aisle of the retrochoir of Winchester Cathedral.<br>
