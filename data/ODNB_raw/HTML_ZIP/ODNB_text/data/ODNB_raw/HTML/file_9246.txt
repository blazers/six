<span class="headword">Feckenham <span class="st"> [Howman]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1584), <span class="occ">abbot of Westminster</span>, was the son of Humphrey Howman (<i>d</i>. 1550) of Beanhall, Feckenham, Worcestershire, a tolerably prosperous husbandman, and his wife, Florence (<i>d</i>. 1550); three other sons and three daughters of this marriage reached adulthood. When both parents died in 1550 their last months had been clouded by John's imprisonment and the seeming end to his clerical career. This had begun when at an early age he entered the Benedictine monastery of Evesham, taking his birthplace for his name in religion.<h2>
<a name="OxfordandEvesham"></a>Oxford and Evesham</h2>Feckenham was sent to Oxford about 1527, and by 1532 had become a fellow of the Benedictine foundation of Gloucester College. It is likely that he was ordained priest, probably back at Worcester, in the Embertide of 1530. Feckenham was a particular friend of Robert Joseph, another monk of Evesham, who had returned from Oxford charged with humanist ideas and an enthusiasm for the art of correspondence. Not all Joseph's friends replied to his elegant letters; that Feckenham did so with a literary polish that matched Joseph's own was specially appreciated. This is early testimony to Feckenham's facility with language, a capacity that (though scarcely evident from his surviving writings) would bring him renown as a preacher and spiritual counsellor. Much, no doubt, depended on the delivery, and a personal charm, which warmed all but the grimmest of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>Feckenham graduated BTh at Oxford on 11 June 1539. On 27 January 1540, on the surrender of Evesham Abbey, he received an annual pension of &pound;10. The same day he was instituted to the vicarage of his native village, presented by lay nominees on behalf of Sheen Priory. Feckenham, however, remained at Oxford, where on 21 March he preached before the university. He became chaplain to Bishop Bell of Worcester, following whose resignation in 1543 he obtained a similar appointment to Bishop Bonner of London, a Worcestershire man. In this capacity he was dispensed on 4 April 1545 to hold an additional benefice, having already (17 March) been instituted to the rectory of Solihull, Warwickshire, at the presentation of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton. Though seemingly resident on neither of his livings, he established in both places a fund for loans to the good poor; at Solihull the subscribers (1548) were his parents, local dignitaries, and former monks and servants of Evesham Abbey.<h2>
<a name="Catholicspokesman"></a>Catholic spokesman</h2>Feckenham accepted the royal supremacy under Henry VIII, but opposed the abolition of sacramentals and the introduction of ideas from abroad; a sermon at Paul's Cross on 16 January 1547 articulating these opinions and, according to the anonymous informer, others &#145;even more odious&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 21/2, no. 710), marks his first appearance on the public stage. If any action was contemplated against him, it was probably overlooked when the king died a few days later. Serious trouble came in 1549; by 22 October Feckenham was imprisoned in the Tower. It has been generally said that this was because of his religious views; but his having been arrested in Oxfordshire by William, Lord Grey of Wilton (whose pacification of that county had left several priests hanging from their steeples), implies more direct involvement in the recent disorders. He remained a prisoner for the rest of Edward VI's reign, though on 1 November 1551 he was released to the custody of Sir Philip Hoby in order to take part in debates at the London houses of the earl of Bedford, who was lord privy seal, Secretary Cecil, and Sir John Cheke. More remarkably still, he was then taken to Worcestershire for further public disputations with Bishop Hooper.<br>
<br>Feckenham was freed on the accession of Queen Mary, and became her chaplain and confessor. On 24 September 1553 he preached at Paul's Cross, and was to become a familiar occupant of this and other London pulpits. On 25 January 1554 Bonner collated him to the prebend of Kentish Town, with a canonry in St Paul's Cathedral. In February he was sent by the queen to speak with Lady Guildford Dudley (the former Jane Grey), who was about to be executed for her earlier treason. Feckenham is said to have been given a respectful hearing, but quite failed to deflect her from her protestant convictions. He attended her on the scaffold, the scene so astonishingly evoked by Delaroche (1834). Feckenham also interrogated Princess Elizabeth and urged the queen to preserve her from her cousin's fate.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1554 Feckenham was elected dean of St Paul's, retaining his prebend. During April he attended the disputations with Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley at the university church in Oxford. On 20 June he was presented by the queen to a canonry in Canterbury Cathedral, but this does not appear to have taken effect. During this year he vacated his original parish livings, and on 26 June was instituted to the vicarage of Finchley, Middlesex; this he resigned by November, probably on institution to the rectory of Great Greenford, Middlesex, on 24 September.<br>
<br>On 25 November Feckenham preached again at Paul's Cross. Machyn records his theme as Dives and Lazarus; what he actually said was that all property taken from the church during the reigns of Henry and Edward should be unconditionally returned. This was embarrassing to the government, in the process of delicate negotiation to achieve England's absolution from schism without such reparations. Feckenham was consequently summoned to appear before the privy council with his offending text on 29 November. There was some suspicion that he had been put up to this by Pole in order to express what the cardinal himself believed but could not publicly advocate. The considered view is that Feckenham acted on his own initiative; in any case the matter brought him no lasting disfavour.<h2>
<a name="AbbotofWestminster"></a>Abbot of Westminster</h2>At some time in the next few months Feckenham was chosen, in a fashion unknown, to lead a group of former monks seeking to return to the religious life. In a carefully staged appearance at court in March 1555 Feckenham and fifteen others petitioned the queen, who tearfully committed the practicalities to Stephen Gardiner and other councillors. The technical problems in satisfying these revived vocations were considerable; it was not until 21 June that Paul IV's bull <span class="italic">Praeclara charissimi</span> pronounced the old English monasteries canonically dead. Pole, whose particular scheme this was, in any case did not want merely to restore the old, but to introduce the reformed monasticism he had known in Italy. The abbey eventually established at Westminster would be a new creation, inspired by the Cassinese model. Meanwhile Feckenham continued to officiate as dean of St Paul's; on 17 June he preached at the requiem for King Philip's deranged grandmother Juana of Castile, competently handling the requirements of this uninspiring state occasion.<br>
<br>During 1556 Feckenham was frequently employed to interrogate those arrested in connection with the Dudley conspiracy. In May he was awarded the degree of DTh (in effect <i>honoris causa</i>) by Oxford. In July he helped the government to its greatest propaganda success, the conversion of Sir John Cheke. By the time Feckenham spoke at the formal recantation on 4 October, the formalities for turning Westminster Abbey back into a Benedictine house were nearing completion. Feckenham necessarily resigned all his secular preferments at this point. The new abbey was endowed on 10 November. No formal record of the inauguration exists, but it would seem that Feckenham and about fifteen monks received their habits on 21 November, and that the abbot was blessed on 29 November when Bonner celebrated <i>coram cardinale</i>.<br>
<br>Feckenham's abbacy is poorly documented. From later testimony it appears that the regime was more collegiate than in the traditional monastic style. The extent to which this reflected Feckenham's own preferences is impossible to determine, but his own previous monastic experience had been much diluted by residence at Oxford. Certainly the complex financial system of the old monasteries was not revived, and the abbot ran the administration. There was never enough money, though Feckenham was able to spend something on repairs to his country house at Chiswick. At Westminster he recovered the former abbot's lodging (now the deanery), which had passed into lay occupancy in Edward's reign. Within the abbey church his chief contribution was the restoration of Edward the Confessor's shrine, completed in April 1557. The extant wooden superstructure of classical design was long supposed to date from this time, but possibly this was simply reassembled under Feckenham's direction. The saint's body was restored at the same time.<br>
<br>Feckenham also prominently defended the rights of sanctuary at Westminster. This had not been legally affected by the restoration of the monastery, since its basis was now in a statute of 1540. But Feckenham made it an issue, parading the sanctuary men with his community, and claiming to have given new life to a humanitarian institution neglected in the days of schism. This was awkward for Mary's government, worried as ever by public order, and anxious that the queen's prestigious refoundation should not be associated in the public mind with a thieves' kitchen. Feckenham was repeatedly instructed to maintain tighter control. In the parliament of 1558 (where the abbot sat as a spiritual peer) the government proposed to legislate away much of the residual privilege of sanctuary. Feckenham was invited to state his case on 3 February, which he did by citing a grant of King Lucius and other dubious evidences. He returned on 12 February backed by counsel, when legal and political argument rather than antiquarian rhetoric persuaded the government to withdraw its proposals.<h2>
<a name="Resistingprotestantism"></a>Resisting protestantism</h2>Feckenham and his monks were still in occupation of the abbey when Elizabeth I was crowned there on 15 January 1559. The abbot's role in the ceremony was the more prominent because the actual coronation had to be performed by the bishop of Carlisle. At the start of the first Elizabethan parliament (January&#150;May 1559) Feckenham was publicly rebuked by the queen when taper-bearing monks greeted her arrival for the opening session. In that parliament the abbot retained his seat in the Lords, where he spoke vehemently against the <span class="roman">Uniformity Bill</span>, though abstaining from the vote. The same parliament also enacted the dissolution of Mary's religious foundations, and so ended Feckenham's career. A story that he was offered the primacy has no contemporary foundation, though no doubt his conformity would have earned him a decent reward. There was a rumour that the monks would be tolerated if they accepted a protestant liturgy, but this can never have been a realistic proposition. Westminster Abbey fell for the second time with effect from midsummer 1559. Pending new arrangements there Feckenham was allowed to remain, and he co-operated amicably with the lay officials who wound up the affairs of the abbey. He was permitted to keep such liturgical effects as would be illegal under the restored protestant order. But because he refused the oath of uniformity, he forfeited the offer of a pension.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1560, the eve of the erection of the second collegiate church of Westminster, Feckenham was sent to the Tower for his overt opposition to the settlement of 1559. Thereafter he was moved from place to place, not infrequently bringing harsher conditions upon himself by his conduct during periods of relaxed detention or complete freedom. His first release was to the custody of Dean Gabriel Goodman at Westminster. While there in April 1563 he gave a collection of copes and other vestments to the dean and chapter. Later that year he was transferred to the household of Bishop Horne of Winchester, who had recalled Feckenham's openness of mind from an earlier encounter, and had some hopes of securing a notable conversion. But Feckenham had already written a tract reaffirming his refusal to conform, and to this Horne published a reply in 1566 (<span class="italic">An Answeare &hellip; to &hellip; the Declaration of such Scruples</span>; STC 13818). On Feckenham's behalf Thomas Stapleton responded with his <span class="italic">A Counterblast to M. Hornes Vayne Blaste Against M. Fekenham</span> (1567; STC 23231), itself answered by John Bridges in 1573 (<span class="italic">The Supremacie of Christian Princes</span>; STC 3737). Stapleton's work has been of incidental but more lasting usefulness in supplying some details of Feckenham's career.<br>
<br>In 1565 Horne asked to be discharged of his responsibility for Feckenham, who was then returned to the Tower. While there in 1567 he gave further assistance to the dean and chapter of Westminster by supporting, with precedent from his own time, their claim against the College of Arms for funeral furnishings. In 1571 a further round of polemics was prompted by a sermon in the Tower on 15 January by John Gough, to which Feckenham composed a rebuttal. This is said to have been printed, but only the responses by Gough himself and Laurence Tomson (STC 12131, 24113) are known. Feckenham was subsequently transferred to the Marshalsea. From there, by the privy council's order of 17 July 1574, he was released on Archbishop Parker's security, and he lived for some time at liberty in Holborn.<br>
<br>Parker's death in May 1575 terminated this parole, and on 18 July the master of the rolls (or in his absence the recorder of London) was instructed to take new bonds for his good behaviour. He was then allowed to go to Bath for the waters, returning to &#145;the place where he presently is&#146; by Michaelmas  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1575&#150;8</i>, 8). A similar excursion was permitted in 1576. But in June 1577 he and other Catholic parolists were accused of having abused their freedom by receiving &#145;evill disposed&#146; persons whom they yet further &#145;perverted in Religion&#146;  (ibid., 371). Feckenham was then sent to the custody of Bishop Cox of Ely. Cox immediately objected to Feckenham's attendance by a Catholic servant, but the council realistically thought this preferable to hazarding &#145;a sounde body&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1577&#150;8</i>, 13). In October 1579 Cox complained that his prisoner had taken to &#145;open discomending&#146; of the established religion; at this point the council agreed to the replacement of the Catholic servant, and Feckenham himself was put on hard rations  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1578&#150;80</i>, 291). In June 1580 Cox had evidently come to find Feckenham an intolerable burden, and asked Burghley to be relieved of his charge. Conceivably Feckenham's table talk had hardened into garrulity. Their association can never have been mutually agreeable, and may even have been embittered by memories of Westminster, where Cox also had once been master.<h2>
<a name="Deathandimage"></a>Death and image</h2>By October 1580 Feckenham had been taken to Wisbech Castle, at the extremity of Cox's diocese, where other Catholic priests were imprisoned. While there he signed his agreement to vernacular liturgy and certain other practices of the reformed church, but resolutely refused to make the full recantation that was so often sought of him. He died at Wisbech, and was buried in the churchyard there on 16 October 1584.<br>
<br>Although Feckenham disqualified himself from a pension when Westminster was dissolved, he retained throughout his remaining life a comfortable income, from which he helped two kinsmen with exhibitions at Cambridge, and provided charitable amenities at Holborn, Bath, and Wisbech. Apart from the surviving sermons and speeches, he wrote a medical treatise which circulated in manuscript and was still being copied as a practical guide in the later seventeenth century. In so far as Feckenham has a public image, it was fashioned by the painters of the British historical school of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for whom the last days of Jane Grey as described by John Foxe provided a favourite theme. Thus James Northcote in 1792 portrays &#145;Abbot&#146; Feckenham as a ferocious black-bearded inquisitor, gesturing vainly while Jane kneels in prayer. Frederick Yeames's image (1868) is no less menacing for its understatement; he sets the encounter not in a Gothic dungeon but in a spacious domestic interior, where Feckenham (white-haired, avuncular, dressed as a modern Roman priest) leans forward in patient exposition. Jane sits bolt upright, staring fixedly away from Feckenham and his outstretched hand; his immediate concern, apparently, is not for her neck but her knee. Contrary to these Feckenham was a stocky, red-faced man, who maintained his dignity while not disdaining simple social pleasures. As the last <i>de facto</i>&#151;as opposed to titular&#151;abbot he has a prescriptive place in Catholic and especially Benedictine history; he belongs in equal measure to the old English monasticism of his first profession, and to resurgent tradition which reckons its descent from Marian Westminster.<br>
