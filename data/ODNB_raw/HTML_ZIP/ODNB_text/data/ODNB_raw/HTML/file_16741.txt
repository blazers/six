<span class="headword">Linskill,  Mary Jane</span>  (1840&#150;1891), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, born in Blackburns Yard, Whitby, Yorkshire, on 13 December 1840, was the eldest child of Thomas Henry Linskill (1809&#150;1874), watchmaker and constable of the town, and his wife, Mary Ann Tireman (1814&#150;1903). Mary Linskill attended a private school in Bagdale, Whitby. She was apprenticed to a milliner and later worked in shops in the midlands. She then became a governess, and while so employed in Leeds her first work, <span class="italic">Tales of the North Riding</span> (1871), written under the pseudonym Stephen Yorke, was published. On the death of her father she returned to Whitby and tried to establish herself as a writer in order to maintain her mother and younger siblings who had been left impoverished. By her own efforts she raised herself out of the unproductive, non-creative, inarticulate majority which surrounded her. The noisy ebb and flow of communal life in a Whitby yard was torture to her sensitive nature, and only in the very early hours of the day would the isolation and peace of silence envelop and enrich her. But if the life of the yard gave no support to the creative mood, it did supply the turbulent background against which her spirit enacted its essential creative role. Unsupported by a husband or a father, she managed to produce three major novels (<span class="italic">Between the Heather and the Northern Sea</span> in 1884, <span class="italic">The Haven under the Hill</span> in 1886, and <span class="italic">In Exchange for a Soul</span> in 1887) and a score of lesser tales over a period of twenty years. Mary Linskill was deeply religious and her writing reflects the monastic and maritime influence of the old seaport of Whitby. Much of her fiction was published by the SPCK. She made short-lived efforts to get away from the yard, moving to nearby Ruswarp and Newholm, but was forced by poverty to return to Whitby. Eventually she and her mother moved to a pleasant house in Spring Vale, in the town, a few years before she died, of apoplexy, on 9 April 1891 at the age of fifty. She was buried in Whitby cemetery. The greater part of Mary Linskill's writing was published in <span class="italic">Good Words</span>, and it was one of its sub-editors, John Hutton, who wrote a eulogistic, if inaccurate, memoir in the 1891 edition, on which the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> entry was based.<br>
