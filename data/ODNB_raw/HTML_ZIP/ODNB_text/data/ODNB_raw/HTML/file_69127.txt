<span class="headword">Stranger,  Hannah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1656&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>, was the wife of John Stranger, combmaker of London. Hannah was one of the women who, with Martha Simmonds, challenged Francis Howgill and Edward Hubberthorne at London Friends' meetings in the summer of 1656, interrupting the meetings by singing. She and her husband were among the group who travelled to Exeter in October 1656 to secure Nayler's release from gaol. With Nayler, Martha and Thomas Simmonds, Dorcas Erbury, and three others they journeyed through Wells and Glastonbury, arriving in Bristol on 24 October. Hannah and Martha Simmonds walked on either side of Nayler's horse, holding the bridle, singing with their companions &#145;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Israel&#146;. They were arrested, imprisoned, and questioned by Bristol magistrates before being sent to London in November for Nayler's trial.<br>
<br>Letters from Hannah, found on Nayler at the time of his arrest, were given as evidence of his blasphemy. Writing to Nayler from London (16 September 1656) Hannah had described him as &#145;Thou everlasting son of righteousnesse and Prince of Peace&#146;  (Deacon, 6). Another letter addressed him as &#145;Oh thou fairest of ten thousand, thou only begotten son of God&#146;, and its references to his &#145;Spouse&#146; were taken to imply an improper relationship with Martha Simmonds  (Farmer, 7). Particularly damaging was a postscript by John Stranger: &#145;Thy name is no more to be called James but Jesus.&#146; On examination Hannah said that she had acted at the Lord's command. Like her husband, she avoided compounding the misunderstanding of their actions by refusing to answer questions about Nayler's being called Jesus. Thomas Cole, keeper of Newgate prison in Bristol, testified to the idolatrous behaviour of the women towards Nayler during their confinement, describing their kneeling before him. When Nayler was punished on 27 December the women sat at the foot of the pillory. Hannah wrote a section of Martha Simmonds's <span class="italic">O England, thy Time is Come</span> (1656/7?) beginning &#145;Consider I beseech you how clearly the Scripture is fulfilled in our dayes&#146;, speaking elliptically of Nayler's sufferings and proclaiming the coming of the Lord  (Simmonds, 6).<br>
<br>Ostracized by Friends, some of the group persisted in their protests while others, including Hannah, sought reconciliation. In 1666, after her second marriage, to Henry Salter, with whom she had two sons in 1667 and 1668, she was received by Bristol Friends and at a meeting on 2 November 1669 submitted a written testimony of contrition for her former actions. In 1671 she and Martha Fisher went at Fox's request to the king to ask for Margaret Fell's liberty. That her reputation was still sensitive is indicated by Ellwood's deletion of her name in his edition of Fox's journal, replacing it with &#145;another Woman-Friend&#146;  (Penney, 2.169). Her later life is undocumented, though she has been identified as a property-owning widow in Tokaney, Delaware, in 1678&#150;9.<br>
