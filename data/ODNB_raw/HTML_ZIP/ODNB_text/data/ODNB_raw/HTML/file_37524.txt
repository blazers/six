<span class="headword">Hayes,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1550, <em>d.</em> in or after 1613), <span class="occ">seaman and promoter of colonization</span>, was probably born in West Derby, Lancashire, the son of Edward Hayes and his wife, Alice, small landowners in Lancashire. His father moved into Liverpool before 1567 and established himself as a merchant, and the younger Edward probably attended a grammar school there before his admission to King's College, Cambridge, in 1565. His presence was not continuous as he was entered again as a scholar-commoner in 1571; he did not take a degree. Shortly afterwards he apparently became tutor to a son or sons of Sir Thomas Hoby of Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, whose wife, Elizabeth, commended him to her brother-in-law William Cecil (later Baron Burghley), whom Hayes apparently served in unknown capacities for at least twenty years. He may have accompanied Edward Hoby on a continental tour in 1576 or 1577.<br>
<br>Hayes evidently had a taste for the sea and for exploration. In 1578 he subscribed to the first unsuccessful colonizing voyage of Sir Humphrey Gilbert. He acquired a small ship of 40 tons, which he named the <i>Golden Hind</i> in honour of Sir Francis Drake. After interminable waiting he accompanied Gilbert to Newfoundland in 1583, witnessed Gilbert's actions there, and survived various disasters, culminating in the loss of Gilbert at sea, to bring his ship home in September 1583 as the sole vessel to survive the expedition. He contributed information on the voyage to <span class="italic">A True Report</span> by Sir George Peckham before the end of the year, and sat down to record a detailed narrative of the voyage and some description of Newfoundland. This he passed eventually to Richard Hakluyt for publication in his <span class="italic">Principall Navigations</span> in 1589. It is one of the finest voyage narratives in the collection, vivid and informative, and conveying well the atmosphere of an exploring voyage. This is especially true of the circumstances of Gilbert's death at sea. Sailing, as he insisted on doing, in his tiny 8 ton frigate <i>Squirrel</i>, Gilbert kept close company with Hayes's <i>Golden Hind</i>, and came on board from time to time. Hayes last saw him:<blockquote>sitting abafte with a booke in his hande, cryed out unto us in the Hinde (so often as wee did approche within hearing): Wee are as neere to heaven by Sea, as by lande. Reiterating the same speeche, well beseeming a souldier, resolute in Jesus Christe, as I can testifie he was. The same Mundaye night about twelve of the clocke, or not long after, the Frigat beeing a heade of us in the Golden Hinde, suddenly her lights were out, whereof as it were in a moment we lost the sight, and withall our watch cryed, the Generall was cast away, which was too true. For in that moment, the Frigat was devoured and swallowed uppe of the Sea. (Hakluyt, <span class="italic">Principall Navigations</span>, 1589, 695)</blockquote>During the Spanish war Hayes is found engaged in privateering between 1589 and 1591, but the rest of his life was spent largely in projecting. He bombarded Burghley with schemes for exploiting Newfoundland in 1585 and 1586, interestingly proposing the financing of one of them on the tontine principle, but they involved impractical proposals, as the international fishery could not be controlled by any one country except at vast expense. In the early 1590s Hayes turned his attention to the maritimes and New England, and his long proposal for colonizing and developing the commerce of this region is one of the fullest and most sensible colonial projects of the period. It was printed in shortened form in the <span class="italic">Briefe and True Relation</span> (1602) by John Brereton. Hayes kept in close contact with the twists and turns of English interest in North America for nearly thirty years, even if his plans for financing the Virginia Company in 1606 form a mere footnote to the history of that enterprise.<br>
<br>Hayes moved his residence frequently. In 1585 he lived at Charing Cross, in 1589&#150;90 in Writtington, Essex, by 1596 he writes from &#145;my house in Hamsell Park, Sussex&#146;, while early in the 1600s he may have lived for a time in Isleworth, Middlesex. In association with his technically minded relative Thomas Hayes (the exact relationship is not known) he may have had an iron furnace and hammer pond at Hamsell Farm, and possibly a smelter and perhaps a coining press in Isleworth at the end of the century. He wrote numerous promotion schemes, mostly involving the grant of monopolies to himself and his associate. His favourite was the making of a copper coinage for England, with which he approached successive lord treasurers between 1579 and 1613. He acquired his sole opportunity in 1599 when he induced Sir Robert Cecil to approve a copper coinage scheme for Ireland, which was put into operation in 1601, though he was not able to secure a monopoly for its production. He also directed the issue of a debased silver coinage, which caused much hardship in Ireland and was finally withdrawn in 1603. He was for a time in Ireland overseeing the introduction of these changes, and he and Thomas were both given substantial pensions (&pound;100 each) in 1603.<br>
<br>Hayes's other projects from time to time involved the militia, the London water supply, various technical innovations in rolling-mill design, a stamping machine for coinage (these may well have originated with Thomas Hayes), and others. In 1606 he returned to the financing of colonies. With Thomas, he proposed a scheme by which government and private capital could be combined for the financing of the proposed Virginia colony: this is of some interest, but was not taken up. He disappears from view in 1613, and may have died shortly afterwards. He was a typical projector of the period, and he also had gifts as a writer, though some of his projects appear wrapped in airy rhetoric: only his colonizing plans are of enduring interest.<br>
