<span class="headword">Einarr</span> <span class="st"> [Torf-Einar, Einarr R&ouml;gnvaldarson]</span>, earl of Orkney  (<em>fl. </em>early 890s&#150;930s), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the youngest son of Earl R&ouml;gnvald of M&ouml;re (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.894) and a concubine, who was said (by R&ouml;gnvald) to have been slave-born on both her father's and her mother's side. Torf-Einar was a contemporary nickname. Despite his disability of birth, Einarr was very successful in establishing the M&ouml;re dynasty's control in Orkney, and was the founder of the line of earls which continued in unbroken succession until the ending of the earldom in 1470. The story in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> of Earl R&ouml;gnvald's giving the earldom to his youngest son, expressing the unlikelihood that he would make much of a ruler, and saying that he was glad to get rid of him, is a variant of a common scene in Old Norse literature, the &#145;provocation scene&#146;. Such a scene always foreshadows the young man in question proving himself to be the opposite of whatever has been predicted for him. Einarr promises that he will never return from the islands; he is given a fully equipped ship of twenty benches by his father, has the title of earl conferred on him by the king, and sails west for his first battle with the vikings who had been overrunning Orkney.<br>
<br>The circumstances by which the earldom of Orkney was established over the northern isles are not very clear, despite the clarity of the saga account. The means by which Earl R&ouml;gnvald of M&ouml;re gained control of them, and the nature of the grant he received from Harald Finehair, king of Norway, are very much in doubt, although the saga says that he was given Shetland and Orkney in compensation for the death of his son Ivar on the royal expedition to the British Isles. The <span class="italic">Historia Norvegiae</span> of <i>c</i>.1200 makes no mention of any royal grant, but records that the islands were conquered by Earl R&ouml;gnvald entirely on his own account. However, according to the saga he gave the islands to his brother, Sigurd, who was a &#145;forecastleman&#146; on King Harald's ship, and Sigurd was given the title of earl by the king. These repeated pieces of information about royal grants could very easily have been added by the thirteenth-century saga writer for contemporary reasons of political correctness.<br>
<br>The rule in Orkney of Earl Sigurd the Mighty (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.870&#150;890) was remembered as the first period of conquest and expansion on the north Scottish mainland, when the earl joined forces with Thorstein the Red, son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f the White and Aud the Deepminded, to overrun &#145;the whole of Caithness and a large part of Argyll, Moray and Ross&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 5). The story of Sigurd's death after a successful battle with the Scottish earl Mael Brigte (Melbrikta) is a famous incident in the saga. This occurred after he was infected from a cut to his thigh caused by the projecting tooth of the dead Scot, which scratched him as the successful Norse warriors rode back home with their victims' heads strapped to their saddle bows. This incident is also interpreted as a standard literary motif, that of the &#145;avenging head&#146;, but this time with Celtic associations. The likelihood that Sigurd was killed on campaign is strengthened from the added detail (probably reliable) that he was buried in a mound on the banks of the River Oykel, the traditional southern boundary of Norse territory in north Scotland: perhaps indeed at Cyderhall (<i>Sigur&eth;ar haugr</i>, &#145;Sigurd's Mound&#146;) in Sutherland.<br>
<br>The period after Sigurd the Mighty's death seems to have been one of problems for the earldom: there was the rapid succession of Earl Sigurd's son Guttorm, who died after a year, and Earl R&ouml;gnvald's son Hallad (given the title of earl by King Harald), who failed to do anything about controlling the vikings who were raiding the islands and Caithness at the time. He gave up his earldom and retired back to Norway as a &#145;common landholder&#146; (<i>hauldr</i>). So Einarr was faced with the task of rescuing the family's possession of the islands, and a skaldic verse records his killing two Danish vikings: &#145;after that he took over the island territories and became a great leader&#146;, in the words of the saga, which goes on to attempt to explain his nickname, declaring (erroneously) that he &#145;was the first man to dig peat for fuel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 7). The unreliable nature of this explanation is clear when it is said that he did this at Torfnes in Scotland, which is in Easter Ross (Tarbat Ness), an area with which Einarr had no recorded connection at all. This unsatisfactory linking of nickname with placename shows clearly that by <i>c</i>.1200 it was quite unknown why the earl was called Torf-Einar.<br>
<br>The saga writer derived most of his information from the five skaldic verses composed by Einarr himself about his contest with H&aacute;lfdan Long-Leg, the son of Harald Finehair. Relations between the M&ouml;re family and the sons of Harald had deteriorated into a feud, which climaxed in the contest between Einarr and H&aacute;lfdan, who managed to set himself up as king in the islands for a period. Einarr's victory, and ceremonial killing of H&aacute;lfdan as an offering to Odin, is expressed in the verses as being his revenge for H&aacute;lfdan's murder of his father, R&ouml;gnvald&#151;revenge that his brothers had failed to exact. The &#145;blood-eagling&#146; of H&aacute;lfdan, described in detail by the saga writer, may derive from his misunderstanding of skaldic terminology. The verse certainly suggests that H&aacute;lfdan was buried under a stone cairn (possibly in North Ronaldsay).<br>
<br>Einarr's entrenched position in Orkney meant that King Harald was unable to dislodge him in a succeeding expedition to avenge H&aacute;lfdan's murder, although the king imposed a fine of 60 gold marks on the islands, which may be the only reliable fact to be gleaned from the negotiation, recorded in variant forms in different sagas. The incident was later remembered as the occasion when the Orkney farmers lost control of their family lands (their &#145;odal&#146;), which they resigned to the earl, who paid the whole fine. It was also interpreted later as being the occasion when the earl lost his own right to his family &#145;odal&#146; and held his earldom &#145;in fee&#146; from the king. It is certainly the first of many recorded agreements between king and earl, and was looked back to later as forming a landmark in the formal association of Orkney with Norway.<br>
<br>It was known in the later middle ages that Einarr &#145;be lang tyme brukit the said Erildome, habundand in mycht and riches&#146;  (&#145;Genealogy of the earls&#146;, 75). He seems to have been unchallenged for the remainder of his rule, and &#145;died in his bed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 8), leaving three sons. His own successes in establishing his rule in the islands made him a worthy progenitor of the earldom dynasty which he firmly established, despite his slave-born mother. He is described as being tall and ugly, and was moreover one-eyed, though &#145;still the most keen-sighted of men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 7): does this personal trait give a hint of Odin's mark on the one earl who has some pagan association in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>?<br>
