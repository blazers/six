<span class="headword">Porter,  David</span>  (1746/7&#150;1819), <span class="occ">chimney sweep, social reformer, and property developer</span>, was the son of Stephen Porter (1727/8&#150;1766), an itinerant country chimney sweep from Peterborough. His mother was probably Mary Porter, Stephen Porter's wife at the time of his death. According to his <span class="italic">Considerations on the Present State of Chimney Sweepers</span> (1792) David worked as a climbing boy between the ages of ten and nineteen, &#145;trudging the streets &hellip; excluded from society&#146;, though he &#145;lost but few opportunities of improving either my mind or my fortune&#146;  (Porter, <span class="italic">Considerations</span>, vii&#150;viii). On 26 April 1770 at Thornhaugh near Peterborough he married Edith (<i>bap</i>. 1749, <i>d</i>. 1805), daughter of John Glithero, stonemason of Wansford. They moved to the City of London, where Porter worked as a master chimney sweep and where their first two children, Mary and Stephen, were baptized&#151;at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street. By 1774 the family had moved westwards to 9 Little Welbeck Street, and later 7 Welbeck Street, in St Marylebone, where they had five more children, all of whom died before their father; an illegitimate son he had with Mary Bates, David Charles Porter, born in 1801, was adopted as his son and &#145;resides with me as part of my family&#146;  (will, Porter). The eldest son, Stephen, attended Trinity College, Cambridge, after Horace Walpole had asked a friend to recommend him to the college  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span> 16.217).<br>
<br>During the 1770s and 1780s Porter built up his chimney sweeping trade in the newly developing West End, so that he soon &#145;ran away with the bulk of the business at the West End of the Town&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minutes</span>, 107), with a lucrative sideline in selling soot to farmers as a fertilizer, about which he published a pamphlet in 1785. A large and decorative trade card from this period (now in the Banks Collection in the British Museum) describes him as &#145;Chimney Sweeper to Her Royal Highness the Princess Amelia&#146;.<br>
<br>In addition to his business interests Porter also sought to reform the conditions of fellow sweeps, providing the social reformer Jonas Hanway with inside information &#145;about the hardships and cruelties of the trade&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 22 April 1788, 405). With Hanway he brought together groups of people to try to regulate the worst practices of the trade and to improve the lot of climbing boys, maltreated as apprentices and afterwards too poorly educated to enter any other trade, and too numerous all to become master sweeps. In 1780 they formed the short-lived Friendly Society to Promote the Interest and Credit of Chimney-Sweepers, for which Porter drew up the articles of agreement. Porter and other friends continued to pursue reform after Hanway's death in 1786; two years later they formed &#145;a committee in behalf of climbing boys&#146;, drawn mainly from the Marine Society, with Porter framing a bill for their relief.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1788 Porter presented a petition to the House of Commons for the bill entitled <span class="roman">Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers</span>  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 22 April 1788, 405). This measure, prompted by his &#145;great Anxiety&#146; at the &#145;hardships and Cruelties which Boys placed out to Chimney Sweepers generally undergo&#146;, sought to limit the number of apprentices to six per master; to prevent children younger than eight climbing chimneys; to end the practice of climbing chimneys on fire; and to demand of masters certain obligations to their apprentices, such as decent clothing, weekly baths, and the provision of Sunday worship. Failure to implement these improvements was to be punishable by a &pound;5&#150;&pound;10 fine.<br>
<br>Although passed by the Commons, in the Lords the bill &#145;was so mangled as to destroy its effect &hellip; [becoming] only a shadow of protection, a mere mockery&#146;. This spurred Porter to publish his <span class="italic">Considerations on the Present State of Chimney Sweepers</span> (1792, with a revised edition in 1801), in which he again presented his and Hanway's ideas for the better regulation of chimney sweeps and their apprentices, with particular attention to the irregularity of their employment and the meagreness of their wages. He estimated that up to 1500 people made their living by chimney sweeping in London (200 master chimney sweeps and 500 apprentices, together with 200 wives and 400 dependent children, 200 journeymen, and 200 maidservants). However, the income was divided unequally, leaving as many as 1300 people ill provided and many &#145;miserable in the extreme&#146;  (Porter, <span class="italic">Considerations</span>, 30). Porter's study also drew attention to another aspect of the profession, the soot trade to farmers, which was subject to serious abuse. His solution was the formation of a company controlled by London's aldermen and magistrates, with twelve masters to be chosen as guardians of the trade, as well as an office, a secretary, and monthly meetings. In addition Porter recommended that apprentices should on one day a week attend schools opened and run by the company, where boys would receive both instruction and a wholesome meal, and where there would also be a chance to check their welfare. Once apprentices reached sixteen, some were to be placed out to sea, into service, or some other trade.<br>
<br>Porter's ideas caught the attention of polite society. As early as 1784 Horace Walpole wrote of how he had &#145;been these two years wishing to promote my excellent Mr Porter's plan for alleviating the woes of chimney-sweepers&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 39.428). Sir Thomas Bernard, who in 1796 formed the Society for Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor, wrote a paper in 1797 which presented Porter's main ideas and recommended that his plan should be adopted. He also described Porter's exemplary treatment of his own apprentices, who were &#145;kindly treated and well kept &hellip; cleaned and made neat on Saturday night &hellip; and regularly attend divine service at Church on Sunday&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1, no. 19, 114).<br>
<br>In May 1800 Porter drew up the articles of agreement for a new friendly society &#145;for the Protection and Instruction of Chimney Sweepers' Apprentices&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reports</span>, 2, appx 11, 316). Despite the presence of Elizabeth Montagu, the bishop of Durham, Shute Barrington, and William Wilberforce among its officers, this society failed in its objectives. However, three years later another more long-lasting and effective body was formed: the Society for Superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys by Encouraging a New Method of Sweeping Chimnies and for Improving the Conditions of Children and Others Employed by Chimney Sweepers. Officers again included Wilberforce and Barrington, with Thomas Bernard and Porter among the committee members.<br>
<br>Porter remained on this committee until 1816, during which time the society's priorities changed from the improvement of conditions for climbing boys to their abolition, following the introduction of new chimney sweeping &#145;machines&#146;. Yet Porter himself refused to accept this innovation and maintained that climbing boys were the only effective way of cleaning chimneys, while continuing to emphasize the need for careful regulation of the service. In 1818 Porter gave evidence to the Lords' committee considering the bill entitled <span class="roman">Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices</span> (1817), which paved the way for the abolition of climbing boys. He gave thirteen pages of evidence against the bill, among which was much biographical material about his own life as a chimney sweep, climbing boy, and master, as well as his emphatic restatement that machines could not provide an adequate substitute for a well-trained boy. Many saw this as a betrayal of his life's work. In the event the bill was rejected in the Lords, and it was not until four further acts had been passed that climbing boys were finally abolished in 1875.<br>
<br>From 1789 Porter had combined his chimney-sweeping and reforming activities with a second career as a builder and property developer, principally in the Marylebone area of London. His name appears on more than 700 property deeds for much of Gloucester Street and Dorset Square in the north of Marylebone; part of Baker Street in the east; York Street and Crawford Street and all of Montagu Square in the centre; Seymour Place in the west; and George Street and Great Cumberland Place in the south. His prominence as a developer also led to his being consulted by the St Marylebone vestry for his specialist knowledge of building work; for example, in 1806 he presented a plan for building a new chapel on the north side of York Street, and in 1814 he outlined five alternative &#145;propositions&#146; for a new chapel at the western end of the parish. To commemorate his life a small street running eastwards off Baker Street was named David Street (later Porter Street), with its adjacent David Mews.<br>
<br>David Porter died in London on 31 May 1819, aged seventy-two, at his home, 15 Park Place, Regent's Park, later 29 Park Road  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 89, 1819, 1.587). He was buried on 11 June at St Mary's Church, St Marylebone. This erstwhile climbing boy left a fourteen-page will, showing that he had a considerable fortune in leasehold property throughout Marylebone, and some in Clerkenwell, which he bequeathed to his children and grandchildren. His estate was valued at under &pound;60,000 in the death duty register.<br>
<br>Suitable epitaphs can be found in the comments of those who worked with Porter in his campaign for reforms in chimney sweeping. Thomas Bernard emphasized his &#145;extraordinary energy of mind and body&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1, no. 19, 111). For Horace Walpole, writing in 1789, he was &#145;one of the best and most respectable men upon earth, and one whom I esteem after Mr Howard and Mr Hanway, as one of the apostles of humanity&#146;, adding later in the year that &#145;he [is] one of the plainest, simple good men you ever saw, whose honest, open, comely countenance is the picture of his mind&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 16.219).<br>
