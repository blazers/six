<span class="headword">Comber,  Thomas</span>  (1575&#150;1654), <span class="occ">college head and dean of Carlisle</span>, was born at Shermanbury, Sussex, on 1 January 1575, the twelfth child of John Comber (<i>d</i>. 1608), barrister, and his wife, Jane (formerly Dunstall). From a public school at Horsham he matriculated as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1592 and was elected to a scholarship in the following year. He graduated BA in 1595, was elected to a fellowship in 1597, and took his MA in 1598. Subsequently he went abroad for three years and is known to have spent some time at the home of the French reformed theologian Pierre du Moulin, presumably in Charenton. His travels over, he returned to Trinity, to which he was to devote most of the rest of his life. He held office as both junior and senior dean and senior bursar; he proceeded BD in 1609 and DD in 1616.<br>
<br>An outstanding scholar, Comber was well versed in Hebrew, Arabic, Coptic, Samaritan, Syriac, Chaldee, Persian, Greek, and Latin, in addition to having a colloquial knowledge of French, Spanish, and Italian, and was the author of Greek and Latin verses on the death of William Whitaker, published in 1610. A dispute with some Jesuits appears to have confirmed his rising reputation and he was invited by James I to dispute publicly at St Andrews with some Scottish divines. On 26 June 1615 he was instituted to the rectory of Worplesdon, Surrey. Presented to the deanery of Carlisle on 28 August 1629, on 1 November that year he was admitted chaplain-in-extraordinary to Charles I. The same year he married Susan Cotton, a widow, at Kingston in Cambridgeshire; they had one child, Mary.<br>
<br>In October 1631, helped by the patronage of the earl of Portland, Comber became master of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself with a reputation for good scholarship and impartiality. He published some Latin letters in 1633, and is deservedly identified as one of the few who refused to side with either of the two factions which dominated the life of the university in the 1630s. None the less, the college chapel in Trinity was elaborately decorated and reordered during his mastership. He served as vice-chancellor in 1631 and again in 1636.<br>
<br>During the 1640s Comber was ejected from all his preferments and imprisoned for assisting in sending the university plate to the king, and for refusing the covenant. He died in Cambridge on 28 February 1654 and was buried on 3 March in St Botolph's Church, Cambridge, without a tombstone; his wife survived him. His funeral sermon, preached in Trinity College chapel by Robert Boreman, was later published under the title of <span class="italic">The Triumph of Faith over Death, or, The Just Man's Memoriall</span> (1654). A portrait in Trinity shows Comber with a beard and moustache, and what Trevelyan describes as kindly and jovial features.<br>
