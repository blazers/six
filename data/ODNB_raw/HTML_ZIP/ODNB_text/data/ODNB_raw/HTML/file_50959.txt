<span class="headword">Colam,  John</span>  (1827&#150;1910), <span class="occ">campaigner for animal welfare</span>, was born in Louth, Lincolnshire on 18 January 1827, the fifth of the nine children of William Cowlam (Coulam or Colam), master bricklayer, and his wife, Mary Crow. He was baptized at the Canon Street Independent Chapel, Louth. Initially apprenticed to a painter, he moved to London to work for a relative, James Colam (an uncle or grand-uncle), a ham and tongue dealer in Charterhouse Street. He inherited the business on James Colam's death, in March 1851, and successfully expanded it, opening a second shop in Aldersgate Street. By 1856, however, he had relinquished the business, and soon afterwards became a journalist. He had married, on 17 October 1850, Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Newby, fish salesman. His wife died on 15 March 1871 after giving birth to the thirteenth of their children (two of whom died in infancy). He married in 1874 (probably abroad) Frida Louise Charlotta Otilie Ahlers (<i>d</i>. 1932), who was born in Germany; they had a son who died in childhood.<br>
<br>Colam's arrival in 1861 to succeed the recently deceased secretary of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), Mr Middleton, was recalled by a member of the society's executive committee a quarter of a century later as &#145;like the waving of a Magician's wand&#146;  (RSPCA minute book, 19 July 1886, fol. 374). Not hitherto known to the committee, and chosen from twenty-four candidates, Colam was soon being praised at the society's annual meetings for his unusual combination of qualities. He was no mere office clerk: his personal intervention on 28 March 1870 at the Agricultural Hall, Islington, to prevent a bull-fight, incurring bruises in the confrontation that confined him to his bed for several days, became one of the society's oft-recalled epic events. Punctual, business-like, courteous, working long hours and never missing an executive committee meeting, Colam told the annual meeting in 1886 that he always considered &#145;that I am married to the cause&#146;  (RSPCA, <span class="italic">75th Annual Report</span>, 1898, 139). Strict but humane in handling the society's officers, he was quick to complement the society's prosecutions by educational effort, to build up the humanitarian case with improved annual reports and bulky evidence to public inquiries, and periodically to rejuvenate the office arrangements. Even-tempered and judicious, he kept a close grasp on detail and courageously conducted the society's own case in the lawcourts; he took pride in the fact that it was not until 1893 that he received a writ for malicious prosecution  (RSPCA minute book, 12 June 1893, fol. 48). &#145;If he had selected the Bar as his profession&#146;, said the president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, Dr Fleming, in 1886, &#145;he would have risen to the top of the tree&#146;  (RSPCA minute book, 19 July 1886, fol. 378).<br>
<br>Colam was a shrewd strategist. Far from discouraging specialist offshoots from the society, he saw these as the best way to realize two desirable objectives: channelling off potentially distracting concern about what for him were side-issues into dogs' homes, bird and child-protection societies, beekeepers' associations, and homes of rest for horses; and protecting the society's reputation with governments, rich subscribers, and religious groupings by encouraging a distanced but nonsectarian and friendly rivalry from anti-vivisectionist and anti-hunting zealots operating on their own. Ever pursuing the practicable in a world beset by fanaticism and sentimentality, Colam maximized the support for edging forward year by year the state's commitment to humane objectives. He told an international conference in Paris in 1900 that he knew of no method so likely to benefit animals as &#145;a sensible attempt to convince mankind &hellip; that we are not dreamers, but reasonable men and women &hellip; trusting to a gradual development of our principles to accomplish that which at present cannot be attained&#146;  (<span class="italic">Animal World</span>, 1 Sept 1900, 132). Such a standpoint was not always welcome. He was among the prime targets of the anti-vivisectionist Frances Power Cobbe when she grumbled about the RSPCA's timidity; the anti-hunting vegetarian H. S. Salt saw him as &#145;a veritable Proteus in the skill with which he gave the slip to any one who tried to commit him to any course but the safest&#146;  (Salt, 161).<br>
<br>Yet the society's executive committee was happy enough. Pay rises for Colam were frequent: up to &pound;300 a year in 1862, &pound;400 in 1866, &pound;500 in 1872, with further annual rises of &pound;100 in 1880 and 1886, and after his retirement in 1905 an annual pension of &pound;1000  (RSPCA minute books). By 1867 the solicitor John Curling, who had regularly been making scenes at annual meetings, was publicly praising the new regime  (<span class="italic">Annual Report</span>, 1867, 51), and by the 1880s the annual meeting had become a forum for eulogy. &#145;Without Mr. Colam I do not know what we should do&#146;, Dr Fleming told it in 1886  (RSPCA minute book, 19 July 1886, fol. 378). By 1888 there were three Colams at the society's headquarters: Frank Colam had by then been appointed to assist his father, and Robert Colam helped with pressing business when his father was absent.<br>
<br>On retirement Colam carried off many documents with which to write the society's history, but seems never to have delivered. The 1901 census found him living at 21 South Park Hill Road, Croydon, with his wife, cook, and housemaid. He died after a brief illness at Ingeborg, South Park Hill Road, Croydon, on 25 May 1910, aged eighty-three, and at the funeral in Norwood cemetery three days later his third son, Robert Frederick Colam (1859&#150;1942) (recorder of Croydon from 1900 to 1939), was among the principal mourners.<br>
<br>This major lifetime's achievement leaves a puzzle behind, for the RSPCA scarcely noticed Colam's death, <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s obituary was thin, and the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> and <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> ignored him. For this there may be two reasons. First, Colam saw his role as resembling that of a civil servant, tactfully and shrewdly leaving publicity to others. But second, his retirement was marred by an unfortunate incident. So concerned was he for the society's welfare that he mistakenly tried in a confidential letter to influence members of its executive committee on who should succeed him. He recommended an inside candidate trained as a solicitor, whereas the successful candidate was Captain G. L. Derriman, a disabled Grenadier Guards officer whom Colam saw as &#145;a martinet&#146;  (RSPCA minute book, 13 Feb 1905, 356), and who occupied the post from 1905 to 1908. It was an unfortunate lapse on Colam's part, for the society, after growing only slowly in the 1850s and being plagued by public disputes, had made remarkable advances from the 1860s onwards, and for these Colam deserves much of the credit. During his time as secretary the society's annual income rose fortyfold, and the number of its prosecutions fourteenfold. He is a voluntarist equivalent of the unobtrusively effective professional civil servant who was concurrently advancing in the public sphere. Whatever may have happened at the end of his career, Colam's influence as exemplar to other British and even overseas humanitarian bodies was considerable, and deserves acknowledgement.<br>
