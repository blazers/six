<span class="headword">Fastolf <span class="st"> [Falstoli]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1361), <span class="occ">canon lawyer and bishop of St David's</span>, was one of a distinguished group of East Anglian lawyers nurtured by William Bateman (<i>d</i>. 1355), bishop of Norwich. He was one of three lawyer sons of Thomas Fastolf of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. His brother Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1330) was a serjeant-at-law and sometime chief justice of Ireland; another brother, Lawrence, became auditor of the audience court of Canterbury. Thomas probably read law at Cambridge, like other Norfolk lawyers who caught Bateman's attention, though he completed his studies abroad and may have taken his doctorate elsewhere. By 1326 he was a prebendary of York and archdeacon of Coventry, and he subsequently acquired prebends of Bangor (1330), Dublin, and Lincoln (1344), and a canonry at Wells (1347); he was archdeacon of Norwich from 1340 to 1347, and of Wells from 1347 to 1352. These preferments were rewards for public service, given principally at the curia. In 1326 he was a clerk of Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini (<i>d</i>. 1335), and by the mid-1330s he was serving as a papal judge at Avignon. He became an auditor of the holy apostolic palace (or lord of the <i>rota</i>) before 1340, most likely in the time of Bateman, who was appointed to the rota in 1329 and was a dominant presence at the Avignon curia until his death in 1355.<br>
<br>Fastolf was the author of a series of reports containing the arguments in thirty-six cases heard at seventeen sessions of the rota between 11 December 1336 and 26 February 1337. Although there is no evidence that these reports circulated in medieval England, two manuscripts have survived in Germany, and the text was later disseminated widely in its printed form. The first edition was printed in Rome by George Lauer in 1475, as part of a collection of <i>decisiones</i> <i>rotae</i>, under the name of Thomas Falstoli. The Italian editor identified Falstoli as an Etruscan lawyer, but it is now accepted that he must be the English auditor Fastolf. It is known that similar reports were kept by other English auditors, perhaps under the influence of the common-law tradition, and that the genre may have been started by Bateman himself. The 1475 edition states that the <i>decisiones</i> were extracted from a book on practice, but all the extant texts are in strict chronological sequence and evidently constitute a journal of the debates among the auditors of the first grade over two and a half months. Each case, or <i>dubium</i>, is typically stated by an auditor of first instance, with or without factual details, and is then argued back and forth with copious citations of canonical authorities. Nine participating auditors are mentioned by name, but there is no reference to advocates, perhaps because the judicial deliberations took place in secret.<br>
<br>The <i>decisiones</i> <i>rotae</i> flowered later in the fourteenth century and provided the model for the reporting of secular cases in the royal courts of Italy and France in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Reported cases became, in consequence, a distinctive feature of the European <i>jus commune</i> which prevailed until the time of Napoleon. The credit for starting this important case-law tradition may belong to Bateman; but, through the accidents of publication, Fastolf's journal stands at the beginning of the established canon, and now provides the earliest continuous text of legal debate in the rota.<br>
<br>Fastolf's service in Avignon was rewarded in 1352 with the bishopric of St David's, to which he was appointed by papal provision. Upon acceptance of the mitre he resigned his seat in the rota, though the English presence in the court was maintained by Simon Sudbury (<i>d</i>. 1381), another of Bateman's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s and also a compiler of reported cases, who served as an auditor from 1348 to 1361. Fastolf died in June 1361. His brief nuncupative will, dated 21 June 1361, named as his executors David Ley, precentor of St David's, Robert Grymeston, coparcener of Dyserth church, and Philip Dyer, rector of Llanychlwydog; it was proved on 1 July following. His only specific request was that his body be buried in the lady chapel of his cathedral, to the right of the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<br>
