<span class="headword">Palmer,  George</span>  (1818&#150;1897), <span class="occ">biscuit manufacturer</span>, was born at Upton Farm, Long Sutton, Somerset, on 18 January 1818, the eldest of three sons and a daughter (another son died young) of William Palmer, a farmer, and his wife, Mary, daughter of William Isaac, a Dorset tanner. Both families were Quakers of long standing, Mary Isaac being the first cousin of Cyrus and James Clark, founders of C. and J. Clark, shoemakers at Street, Somerset.<br>
<br>After William Palmer died prematurely in 1826, his energetic widow gave up farming in order to train her sons for various trades or professions. George received his education at Sidcot School, near Weston-super-Mare, leaving at the age of fourteen to be apprenticed to an uncle as a miller and confectioner. His ambition was to mechanize the production of biscuits, then made by hand. In 1841 he therefore went into partnership with his cousin by marriage, Thomas Huntley (1802&#150;1857), owner of a Reading firm, founded in 1822, which sold high-quality biscuits over much of southern England; the firm then became Huntley and Palmers. With the technical help of a Reading engineer, William Exall (1808&#150;1881), Palmer in 1846 invented the first continuously running biscuit machinery in the world, which was set up at a factory in Kings Road, Reading. On 17 January 1850 he married Elizabeth Sarah Meteyard (1825&#150;1894), daughter of Robert Meteyard, a Quaker druggist at Basingstoke; they had six sons and four daughters, of whom two sons and a daughter did not survive infancy.<br>
<br>When Thomas Huntley died in 1857, annual turnover of the company was &pound;125,000, as against &pound;2700 in 1841, profits having risen from nil to &pound;18,000 over the same period. George Palmer bought out Huntley's son and took into partnership his own brothers, Samuel and William Isaac Palmer, the former managing the London office and the latter running the factory. Despite all his business commitments, George Palmer took an active part in public affairs. From 1850 onwards he was a Liberal councillor in Reading; he served as mayor in 1857&#150;8, and later became an alderman. In 1878 his Quaker friend, John Bright, persuaded him to stand for parliament, and he was elected MP for Reading, serving until 1885. After a maiden speech which supported the granting to women of the vote, he remained very largely a silent member, but his advice on industrial matters was widely sought. In 1885 he stood as a Liberal for Newbury and was defeated; he did not seek election again.<br>
<br>As early as 1873 Palmer owned 2000 acres of land in Berkshire and neighbouring counties, and subsequently added 2800 acres, including Marlston House near Newbury, which became his country retreat. In 1874&#150;5 the second generation of Palmers&#151;three sons of George, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35372/', "George William Palmer (1851&#150;1913)")</script>, and four of Samuel&#151;became partners in the business, which justifiably claimed to be the largest biscuit firm in the world. About a quarter of its output went overseas, its global reputation being enhanced by successive medals won at international exhibitions, most notably those at Paris in 1867, 1878, and 1900. At home the firm became a kind of national institution after a local bishop had praised its biscuits for conveying &#145;a savour of the quiet fireside and of the social board&#146;, <span class="italic">The Times</span> responding with a bland leader (3 October 1883) and <span class="italic">Punch</span> with a gentle cartoon (13 October 1883).<br>
<br>Palmer was of medium height, and rather rugged in appearance, with a bushy beard, and a tight-lipped expression, perhaps inherited from his formidable mother. He occasionally indulged in devastating outbursts of temper, as when two employees approached him for a rise in wages. Yet he willingly accepted his responsibilities as a paternalistic businessman. Until the firm grew too large in the 1860s, he knew every operative by name; he maintained a sick club with a part-time doctor, a library, and a schoolmaster for the boy employees. He and his bachelor brother, William Isaac Palmer, helped factory hands in need, paying for the funerals of those who died in their service, and providing cash or coal tickets as necessary. To the town of Reading he was generous, presenting to its citizens the 49 acre Palmer Park and the Thames-side Kings Meadow. He also made donations to Reading University College, Reading School, the Royal Berkshire Hospital and, less predictably, several Anglican churches. It was said that his practice of handing out half-crowns to all and sundry turned Reading in his lifetime into a magnet for beggars from all over the kingdom.<br>
<br>In 1891, the golden jubilee of his partnership, he was given the freedom of Reading, a statue of him being erected in the town's main shopping street. That year he refused a baronetcy, and with typical candour made it clear that such an honour would yield him neither comfort nor satisfaction. His last years were darkened by bereavement: he never recovered from his wife's death in 1894, and he suffered from increasing debility. He died of a stroke, at The Acacias, his house in Reading, on 19 August 1897, and was buried at the Quaker burial-ground, Church Street, Reading. That year, the turnover of the company was more than &pound;1.25 million, representing 23,000 tons of biscuits, and profits were &pound;165,000.<br>
