<span class="headword">Moullin,  Edith Ruth  Mansell</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Edith Ruth Thomas]</span>  (1858/9&#150;1941), <span class="occ">suffragette and pacifist</span>, was the daughter of Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd) and David Collet Thomas, merchant and shipowner. Her social conscience was evident from her youth onwards: on leaving school she did &#145;slum work&#146; in Bethnal Green. She helped in a soup kitchen during the dockers' strike and was a founder member of the Anti-Sweating League. She once commented that &#145;my career has been one long record of a supporter of unpopular causes&#146;  (E. R. M. Moullin to Edith How Martyn, 6 Sept 1935, Suffragette Fellowship Collection, 57.116/79). On 20 August 1885 she married Charles William Mansell Moullin (1851&#150;1940), a surgeon at the London Hospital. The couple were firm advocates of women doctors and of women's suffrage. Charles was a vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage. Edith Mansell Moullin belonged to several suffrage societies: the Women's Freedom League, Women's Social and Political Union until 1913, and the Church League for Women's Suffrage&#151;she had already been honorary treasurer of the Church Socialist League.<br>
<br>Proud of her Welsh parentage, Edith Mansell Moullin organized the Welsh contingent in the suffrage coronation procession of 1911. From this she founded a unique organization based in London dedicated to uniting Welsh people of differing viewpoints to work for women's enfranchisement, the Cymric Suffrage Union. Edith became its vice-president. Small, dark-haired, and passionate in her commitments, she did not draw neat distinctions between her public and personal life. Typically, the family's home in fashionable Wimpole Street was the society's headquarters. There were a few branches in Wales and she went on several speaking tours in north Wales.<br>
<br>The Liberal government's announcement of a manhood suffrage measure which effectively threatened the <span class="roman">Conciliation Bill</span>, presaged renewed suffrage militancy in November 1911. Edith sat on the platform with Mrs Pankhurst and Mrs Pethick Lawrence at the Caxton Hall meeting which preceded a demonstration in Parliament Square. She was one of 223 arrested. Charged with trying to break through the police cordon, she denied attempting to disturb the peace, claiming that the police were obstructing her. She spent five days in Holloway. Her suffrage society disbanded and regrouped in October 1912 as the more militant Forward Cymric Suffrage Union (FCSU). Edith was its honorary organizer. It obliged members to put women's suffrage before any other cause, to work for no other political party, and to oppose any government refusing votes for women. Members met regularly at Alan's Tea Rooms, Oxford Circus, and held &#145;at homes&#146; at Wimpole Street where their hostess carefully cultivated a sense of Welshness via speeches and song. Edith's home also became the centre for a &#145;Cat and Mouse&#146; committee to aid suffrage prisoners suffering under the <span class="roman">Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act</span>. This act enabled ailing hunger strikers to be released then imprisoned on recovery. Representatives of many suffrage societies attended. Charles Mansell Moullin had already spoken and written against forcible feeding. Edith commented that although she and her husband had lost &#145;many so-called friends&#146; because of their strong views, she had &#145;made many more loyal and dear comrades&#146;  (E. R. M. Moullin to Edith How Martyn, 6 Sept 1935, Suffragette Fellowship Collection, 57.116/79).<br>
<br>The FCSU continued in wartime. Proceeds from its sales of work relieved distress among Welsh women and children. In October 1914 Edith and Dr Helena Jones launched an appeal to help thirty-six Welsh wives of imprisoned Germans who had been working in Welsh mines. The wives were not receiving relief as they were not considered to be British subjects. By 1916 ill health forced Edith to resign from her FCSU post. She had become a pacifist and well into her seventies would expend her energies in this cause. She was involved with the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR, which she chaired from 1931. Edith was also a voluntary helper at St Dunstan's, the centre founded by the blind newspaper magnate Sir Arthur Pearson where blindness was treated as a challenge rather than as an affliction. In 1930 she wrote an appreciation of her old friend Emily Wilding Davison. It had been Charles Mansell Moullin who had performed the unsuccessful emergency operation on Davison after she had thrown herself in front of the king's horse at the 1913 Derby.<br>
<br>Charles Mansell Moullin died aged eighty-nine in 1940. Edith died the following year on 5 March at 2 Cottesmore Court, Stanford Road, Kensington, the London home of their only child, Oswald. She was eighty-two.<br>
