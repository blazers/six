<span class="headword">Collins,  Richard</span>  (1755&#150;1831), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born and baptized at Gosport, Hampshire, on 30 January 1755, the son of James and Sarah Collins of Gosport. He travelled to London in April 1776 and on 4 October that year entered the Royal Academy Schools; he was trained in the arts of miniature painting and enamelling by Jeremiah Meyer from 1777 to 1778. He may also have been instructed by Ozias Humphry, with whom he shared lodgings in 1780. He became established in practice in London, producing miniatures on ivory and enamel, the brushstrokes so smoothly rendered in both media that his work is characterized by a rather waxy appearance as well as by the fine quality of his draughtsmanship. One of his best works, the undated <span class="italic">Portrait of a Lady</span> (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), shows him to have been capable of penetrating characterization and he was certainly superior in this respect to his master, Jeremiah Meyer. He tended, when working on ivory and enamel, to use rather warm and rich tones, which testify to &#145;an aspiration toward the glossy tones of oil painting&#146;  (Reynolds, 149). Collins rarely signed his work, only occasionally using the monogram R. C., or signing in full on the reverse, as on his miniature of Augustus, duke of Sussex (Victoria and Albert Museum, London): &#145;R<sup>d</sup> Collins pinxit 1789, Portrait Painter in Enamel to His Majesty&#146;.<br>
<br>Collins was married to Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sales (<i>d</i>. 1788), the daughter of a London merchant, on 20 December 1783, with whom he had one daughter. He exhibited miniatures at the Royal Academy between 1777 and 1818. The royal family had already been introduced to Collins's work when the countess of Pembroke employed him to paint a copy of a picture of Queen Charlotte at Windsor in September 1783, and George III saw his miniatures again on a visit to the Royal Academy exhibition in 1787. Following Jeremiah Meyer's death in 1789 the post of enamel painter to the king fell vacant. Collins claimed to have been appointed to the post in preference to Robert Bowyer and Richard Crosse, who had already been assigned the position, at the personal discretion of the king, in sympathy for Collins's deep grief at the recent loss of his wife. Collins painted only members of the royal family between 1788 and 1791, turning to public practice again after that. Several examples of his miniatures of George III and Queen Charlotte copied after Gainsborough and Beechey remain in the Royal Collection. Having worked successfully in London from 23 Pall Mall and later from 39 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, Collins was able to retire on his earnings to Pershore in Worcestershire in 1811. He missed the cultural life of London, however, and returned to live in Islington for three years before his death in Dorset Place, London, on 5 August 1831.<br>
