<span class="headword">Cooper,  William White</span>  (1816&#150;1886), <span class="occ">oculist</span>, was born on 17 November 1816 at Holt, Wiltshire, of unknown parentage. Following his arrival in London about 1834, he enrolled as a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and at the same time he became a private pupil of Edward Stanley, surgeon at St Bartholomew's. Cooper's notes of the lectures of Professor Richard Owen at the Royal College of Surgeons were so outstanding that Owen awarded him a prize; the notes were published as <span class="italic">Lectures in the Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Invertebrate Animals</span> (1843). Cooper became MRCS in 1838, and spent a year or two on foreign travel&#151;his visit to Madeira resulting in his <span class="italic">Invalid's Guide to Madeira</span> (1840).<br>
<br>In 1845 Cooper became FRCS, and in the same year he married on 9 December Mary Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1823/4), daughter of Samuel Poyser of Derby. He associated with the ophthalmic surgeon John Dalrymple, and gained a large practice. He was one of the original staff of the North London Eye Institution, and was subsequently ophthalmic surgeon to St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. Cooper gained a reputation as a careful, steady, and neat operator, judicious and painstaking in treatment. His book <span class="italic">On Wounds and Injuries of the Eye</span> (1859) was the first to treat this subject and was comprehensive for its time. In 1859 Cooper was appointed surgeon-oculist to Queen Victoria, who regularly sought his advice on government matters connected with his specialism.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1884 Cooper suffered blocked veins in his leg. Under the best treatment, he appeared to rally but then, on 29 May 1886&#151;the day on which his knighthood was announced&#151;he fell victim to acute pneumonia. He died at his home, 19 Berkeley Square, Westminster, London, on 1 June. He was survived by his wife and his eldest son, who had followed him into the medical profession.<br>
