<span class="headword">Margary,  Augustus Raymond</span>  (1846&#150;1875), <span class="occ">traveller and consular official</span>, third son of Henry Joshua Margary (<i>d</i>. 1876), major-general RE, and his wife, Louisa Jane, was born at Belgaum, Bombay Presidency, on 26 May 1846. He was educated in France, at Brighton College, and at University College, London. Having received a nomination from his relative Austen Henry Layard (then under-secretary at the Foreign Office), he three times failed the entrance examination, owing to poor spelling, but was given a fourth chance, on which occasion he was successful. He was appointed a student interpreter in the Chinese consular service on 2 February 1867 and the following month went out to China, where, until 1870, he was attached to the legation in Peking (Beijing).<br>
<br>In 1870 Margary was sent to the island of Taiwan, where he took charge of the consulate for twelve months. In 1872 he was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society for saving lives at sea during a typhoon on 9 August 1871; for this action he also received the Albert medal (first class). He was briefly acting interpreter at Shanghai in 1873, and was interpreter at Chefoo (Yantai) from 24 November 1873 to 9 April 1874.<br>
<br>In August 1874 Margary was instructed to travel from Shanghai, through the south-western provinces of China, to Bhamo in Upper Burma, where he was to meet Colonel Horace Browne and act as his interpreter. Browne's ill-considered mission was to attempt to open up the overland trade route between China and India. Margary successfully completed his outward journey of some 1800 miles through Szechwan (Sichuan), Kweichow (Guizhou), and Yunnan in six months, the first Englishman to make the trip. Having met Browne, he returned with the mission across the frontier. Hearing rumours of danger to the mission, he proceeded alone but for his personal staff into Manyunchieh (Mayunjie), where on 21 February 1875 he and his servants were murdered. His head and those of his servants were then stuck up on the walls of the town; only his cook escaped the same fate.<br>
<br>The &#145;Margary affair&#146; was exploited by the British to gain concessions from China on a variety of unrelated issues, including the stationing of a British consulate in Chungking (Chongqing) in Szechwan province; an indemnity of &pound;10,000 from the Chinese was held in trust for Margary's recently widowed mother, three brothers, and nine sisters.<br>
