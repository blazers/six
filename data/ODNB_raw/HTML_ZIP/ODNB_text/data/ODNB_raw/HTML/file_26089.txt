<span class="headword">Spears,  Robert</span>  (1825&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born on 25 September 1825 at Lemington, in Newburn, some 5 miles west of Newcastle, the fifth of six sons and two daughters born to John Spears (1765&#150;1849), who was an ironworker, and his second wife, Mary Glenn (1782/3&#150;1874). He was baptized on 30 September in the Ebenezer Chapel in Swalwell, co. Durham, on the opposite bank of the Tyne. The Presbyterian baptism reflects John Spears's background as a Scottish Calvinist, but Mary Spears was a Methodist and while for a time Robert Spears worshipped in the Newburn parish church, he eventually joined the New Connexion Methodists. He was apprenticed as an engineering smith, and on 1 January 1846, then living in Sugley, Newburn, he married Margaret Kirton (1818&#150;1867), also of Sugley, the daughter of John Kirton, a watchman. Five children were born in the marriage; the youngest daughter, the only one to live past childhood, survived him.<br>
<br>Disliking his work and having been encouraged in self-education by his mother, Spears discovered a gift for teaching and later in 1846 began teaching at a New Connexion school in Scotswood-on-Tyne, also serving as a local preacher. He was, however, denied formal ministerial enrolment because of heterodox tendencies which he traced to attending a debate in Newcastle the previous year between the Revd William Cooke DD (1806&#150;1884) of the New Connexion and the Revd Joseph Barker (1806&#150;1875), who had been expelled from that denomination and was at the time closely associated with Unitarians.<br>
<br>By 1849 a friendship with the Revd George Harris (1794&#150;1859) of Newcastle led Spears to avow Unitarianism, but he continued to teach for the New Connexion while supplying Unitarian pulpits. In 1852 he entered the Unitarian ministry at Sunderland, where a successful school compensated for the lack of a stipend. In 1856 he established a monthly magazine, the <span class="italic">Christian Freeman</span>, which he edited until his death. In 1858 he moved to Stockton-on-Tees at a salary of &pound;65, successfully reviving a declining congregation. The next year he founded a weekly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Stockton Gazette</span>, which under other names and ownership eventually became a daily paper.<br>
<br>Spears was invited to become sub-editor and day-to-day manager of the weekly <span class="italic">Unitarian Herald</span>, established in Manchester in 1861 as a counter, both geographical and theological, to the more advanced views of the London-based <span class="italic">Inquirer</span>. The negotiations failed, but he eventually served for a time as the paper's London agent. His move to London that year was encouraged by Robert Brook Aspland (1805&#150;1869), since 1857 secretary of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association (BFUA). The London District Unitarian Association, through the generosity of Sir James Clark Lawrence (1820&#150;1898), assured Spears a salary of &pound;100 as minister at Stamford Street Chapel, Blackfriars. In 1867 he became co-secretary of the BFUA and in 1870, following Aspland's death, general secretary; he revived the publishing programme and nearly quadrupled the association's income. In October 1867 his wife, Margaret, had died, and on 5 January 1869 he married Emily Glover (1835&#150;1917), the daughter of Joseph Glover, a Dorking butcher; the couple had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Spears's loyalty to an undiluted, biblically based Unitarianism made him an invaluable recruit for Aspland and his allies in their opposition to the transcendentalist reconstruction of Unitarianism identified with James Martineau, who called Spears the orchestrator of sectarian &#145;bluster&#146;  (letter to John Gordon, 28 Dec 1872, Unitarian College MSS, JRL). The &#145;new school&#146; was making generational progress, however. Spears had successfully republished early Unitarian classics and the works of the eloquent American minister William Ellery Channing (1780&#150;1842), but in 1876 the committee of the BFUA decided to republish the works of the radical American Unitarian Theodore Parker (1810&#150;1860) and Spears resigned; a testimonial subscription of &pound;1800 provided him an income for life. He immediately founded <span class="italic">Christian Life</span>, a weekly newspaper which, drawing on talented contributors like Samuel Sharpe (1799&#150;1881) and Alexander Gordon (1841&#150;1931), offered a lively alternative to <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span> until it was finally merged with its rival in 1929.<br>
<br>Spears was an irrepressible missionary. At Stamford Street in 1866 he founded the first lay preachers' union. In 1874 he left Stamford Street for his new foundation at College chapel, Stepney, and he encouraged new or revived congregations in the metropolis and elsewhere in the country. He assisted in the founding in 1886, by Florence Hill (1843&#150;1935) and others, of the Central Postal Mission, to cater to Unitarians without ready access to a chapel. A strong supporter of Indian missions, in 1870 he organized the English tour of Keshab Chandra Sen, the leader of Brahmo Samaj, a Westernizing reformist movement within Hinduism. Ecumenical enthusiasm led him in 1881 to organize the Sion College conferences, which brought together eminent representatives of a wide range of faiths. He was an untiring advocate of Sunday schools, and in 1886, with the help of Matilda Sharpe (1830&#150;1916), he founded Channing House School for Girls in Highgate, having moved there the year before from Stepney to establish a new&#151;and again successful&#151;congregation.<br>
<br>Spears was a man of imposing presence and unfailing energy. Despite his lack of formal education, an unpolished style, and the Northumbrian accent which he thought a disadvantage, he charmed and influenced men and women from all walks of life, notably the wealthy Unitarians who subsidized his many initiatives. He had wide contacts among liberal Christians on the continent, and an extended visit to the United States in 1887 brought him a new circle of friends and admirers. He died at home at Arundel House, The Bank, Highgate Hill, from bladder cancer, on 25 February 1899 and was buried on 1 March in Nunhead cemetery in London.<br>
