</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bracegirdle,  Anne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1671, <em>d.</em> 1748), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born in Northamptonshire, the third surviving daughter of Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Furniss, and Justinian Bracegirdle, &#145;Coachman, Coachmaker or Letter-out of Coaches&#146;, according to her admirer Anthony Aston  (Aston, 8). Family wills reveal that surviving siblings were named Frances, Martha, Hamlet, and John. Anne was baptized, probably as an infant, at St Giles, Northampton, on 15 November 1671 and was about seventy-seven when she died in 1748, rather than eighty-five, as recorded on her tombstone in Westminster Abbey. She &#145;had the good Fortune to be well placed, when an Infant, under the care of Mr. Betterton and his Wife, whose Tenderness she always acknowledges to have been Paternal; Nature formed her for the Stage&#146;  (Betterton, 26). Anne first appears in performance records on 12 January 1688, when she is listed as member of the United Company, although anecdotal evidence from Betterton suggests that she may have been a child performer with the company, playing the page in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> before the age of six. Downes records that during the 1688 season she was mainly cast in supporting roles, such as Atelina in William Mountfort's <span class="italic">The Injured Lovers</span>, Lucia in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Squire of Alsatia</span>, and Emmeline in Dryden's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span>.<br>
<br>The following season, on 20 November, Anne Bracegirdle played her first breeches part, Semernia in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Widow Ranter</span>. She was to become very popular in breeches parts, and often delivered prologues in male garb. Aston recalls: &#145;she was finely shap'd, and had very handsome Legs and Feet; and her Gait, or Walk was free, manlike, and modest, when in Breeches&#146;, although he noted: &#145;she had a Defect, scarce perceptible, viz. Her Right Shoulder a little protended, which, when in Men's Cloaths, was covered by a Long or Campaign Peruke&#146;  (Aston, 10). She also played Marcelia in George Powell's <span class="italic">The Treacherous Brothers</span> and Biancha in Mountfort's <span class="italic">The Successful Strangers</span>. On 16 March 1690 she probably replaced Mrs Boutell to create one of her most famous roles, Statira in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span>, playing opposite Mountfort's Alexander. Colley Cibber recalls the impact of her performance: &#145;If any thing could excuse that desperate Extravagence of Love, that almost frantick Passion of Lee's Alexander the Great, it must have been when Mrs Bracegirdle was his Statira&#146;  (Cibber, 142). By the 1690s Anne was performing in more significant roles, such as Lady Anne in <span class="italic">Richard III</span> and Desdemona in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, and was regularly sent out to charm audiences with prologues and epilogues. Cibber, who joined the United Company in 1690, remembers her:<blockquote>blooming to her Maturity; her Reputation as an actress gradually rising with that of her Person &hellip; she had no greater claim to Beauty than what the most desirable Brunette might pretend to. But her Youth and lively Aspect threw out such a Glow of Health and Chearfulness, that on the Stage few Spectators that were not past it could behold her without Desire. It was even a Fashion among the Gay and Young to have a Taste or Tendre for Mrs. Bracegirdle. (Cibber, 72)</blockquote>This fashionable devotion was to have tragic consequences on 9 December 1692, when the infatuated Captain Hill and violent Lord Mohun attempted to abduct Mrs Bracegirdle. The attempt failed and she retreated to her home in Howard Street, but Hill loitered outside, vowing revenge on Mountfort, whom he perceived to be his rival in love. When Mountfort appeared at the scene, apparently by chance, Hill ran him through and killed him. Whether Bracegirdle and Mountfort were lovers is not clear, but this was certainly implied in the novelized version of the story, <span class="italic">The Players' Tragedy</span>, rushed into print in early 1693. If the tragedy kept Anne off the stage, it was only for the time it took the theatre to recover from Mountfort's murder, as she was recorded by Constantijn Huygens performing Rosamond in John Bancroft's <span class="italic">Henry II</span> on 16 January 1693. After Lord Mohun's trial and acquittal in February 1693, she originated the role of Lady Trickitt in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">The Maid's Last Prayer</span>. Neither this role, nor her Araminta in William Congreve's first play, <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span>, was a great success, but by April her performance in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">The Richmond Heiress</span> had re-established her popularity. This role, like her part in D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Don Quixote, Part II</span> the following year, made use of her strong singing voice. John Eccles helped to train her and provided many popular songs. When Dryden saw <span class="italic">The Richmond Heiress</span>, he thought &#145;the Singing was wonderfully good, And the two [Dogget and Bracegirdle] sung better than Redding and Mrs Ayloff, whose trade it was&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
<br>By 1694 Anne Bracegirdle was one of the leading players of the United Company, recognized for her triumphs in pathetic tragedy, her lively comic sensibility, and her singing prowess. But all was not well within the company under Christopher Rich's management. Cibber remembers that Rich, &#145;under Pretence of bringing younger Actors forward, order'd several of Betterton's and Mrs Barry's chief Parts to be given to young Powel and Mrs Bracegirdle&#146;. Powell accepted, but &#145;Mrs Bracegirdle had a different way of thinking, and desir'd to be excus'd from those of Mrs Barry&#146;  (Cibber, 154). Rich's attempts to divide and rule failed, as the &#145;petition of the players&#146; of 1694 preserved in the lord chamberlain's records  (TNA: PRO LC 7/3) indicates. Mrs Barry petitioned against the splitting of her annual benefit where &#145;a third part of the profitt of Mrs Barry's play [was taken] from her to give to Mrs Bracegirdle&#146;. In article 12 of the petition, Mrs Bracegirdle made a bid for her own annual benefit of an old play, very reasonably offering to defray the house charges and, &#145;what ever she can gett above by the Assistance of her freinds [<i>sic</i>] is all she desires for her self&#146;. Cibber recounts that, after a private hearing with King William, Betterton, Barry, and Bracegirdle received their licence for a new company at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 25 March 1695.<br>
<br>Anne Bracegirdle became a shareholder and a key figure in the newly licensed company. She was considered enough of an attraction, playing Angelica in the theatre's opening production of Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, to be given both the prologue and epilogue to perform. Her contribution to the financial success of the new enterprise is tacitly acknowledged in the prologue to <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, where she explains how the theatre was set up:<blockquote>
<div>By Bribery, errant Brib'ry let me die:<br>
</div>
<div>I was their Agent, but by Jove I swear<br>
</div>
<div>No honourable Member had a Share,<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; I preferr'd my poor Petition<br>
</div>
<div>And brib'd ye to commiserate our Condition.<br>
</div> (W. Congreve, <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, lines 35&#150;7, 46&#150;7)</blockquote>The early years for the new company were difficult, yet Anne consistently proved to be a draw for audiences. She played a range of leading roles during the next few years, among them Isabella in Gildon's <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> and Bellinda in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span>. She had several parts written for her by Congreve, with whom she apparently developed an intimate relationship. She played Almeria in his <span class="italic">The Mourning Bride</span> and, most famously, on 5 March 1700 opened as Millamant in <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>. The following year Congreve thought her Venus, in his <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>, &#145;performed to a miracle&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDA</span>). Tom Brown waxed very satirical on the relationship between Congreve and the reputedly chaste Bracegirdle in his <span class="italic">Amusements Serious and Comical</span>. He quipped that:<blockquote>tis <i>the way of the World</i>, to have an Esteem for the fair sex, and she-looks to a Miracle when she is acting a Part in one of his own Plays &hellip; he Dines with her almost ev'ry day, yet She's a Maid, he rides out with her, and visits her in Publick and Private, yet She's a Maid; if I had not a particular respect for her, I should go near to say he lies with her, yet She's a Maid. (Brown, 51)</blockquote>Several poems of the time implied that Congreve and Bracegirdle had married, although there is no evidence of this. Another writer who created roles for her, but in a different vein, was Nicholas Rowe, who wrote pathetic, tragic heroines such as Selima in <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, Lavinia in <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, and Semanthe in <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>. The Barry&#150;Bracegirdle combination in these plays, which coupled villainess and pathetic heroine, proved to be a popular box-office draw. Anne also captured the headlines during 1701 as Victoria in Southerne's <span class="italic">The Fatal Marriage</span> and the following year as Evandra in Shadwell's <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> and Cordelia in Tate's <span class="italic">King Lear</span>.<br>
<br>Together with Betterton and Barry, Anne Bracegirdle appears to have had a controlling influence in the financial running of the Lincoln's Inn Fields company. When Queen Anne came to the throne, it is these three that are named on the players' petition asking for protection against those reformers who wanted the theatres closed. By 1703 John Verbruggen, a leading player and also a signatory on the shareholding agreement, was complaining that the accounts were kept secret and that &#145;Mr. Betterton Mrs Barry &amp; Mrs Bracegirdle have made Gains to themselves of benefit plays &amp; other wise&#146;  (Downes, 253). The &#145;Three Ruling B&#151;'s&#146; are satirized in the dedication to the anonymous play <span class="italic">The Lunatick</span> (1705), which prophesies the end of their &#145;abuses&#146; when the Haymarket Theatre opens. By 1705 Mrs Bracegirdle's weekly earnings were assured at &pound;3, rising to as much as &pound;5 when profits were good. By 1707 her earnings equalled those of the other leading players, Barry, Betterton, Powell, and Wilks&#151;probably in excess of &pound;120 annually. The 1706&#150;7 season saw what Congreve dubbed &#145;another revolution&#146; as the companies reorganized, and Mrs Bracegirdle moved to the Queen's Theatre, Haymarket, under the management of Owen Swiny. She played a few new roles, including Aspasia in Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span> and Harriet in George Etherege's <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span>, but this season was her last on the stage. Several reasons have been mooted for her departure. Betterton recounts a contest set up between Bracegirdle and the company's rising young actress, Ann Oldfield. They were to play the title role in Betterton's <span class="italic">The Amorous Widow</span> on consecutive nights; in the event, Oldfield &#145;charm'd the whole Audience to that Degree, they almost forgot they had ever seen Mrs. Bracegirdle &hellip; which so much disgusted her celebrated Antagonist, that in a short time after she quitted the Stage&#146;. The anonymous life of Ann Oldfield published in 1730 suggests a further twist, that &#145;Mrs. Oldfield's benefit, being allowed by Swiney [Swiny] to be in the season before Mrs. Bracegirdle's, added so much to the affront that she quitted the stage immediately&#146;  (Genest, 2.375). It is possible that Anne's financial position was adversely affected by the younger talent and the reorganization of the companies. After a final performance on 18 February 1707 as Lavinia in Betterton's <span class="italic">Caius Marius</span>, Anne Bracegirdle quit the stage, &#145;nor could she be persuaded to return to it, under new Masters, upon the most advantageous Terms, that were offered her&#146;  (Cibber, 143). She returned to the stage only once more, for the benefit of her old ally Betterton, in her famed role as Angelica in <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>. One or two mezzotints captured her in action, but her grandest portrait is as an emblematic figure, standing at the feet of William III's horse in Kneller's huge painting of 1697.<br>
<br>It is not clear how Anne Bracegirdle supported herself after her departure from the stage, but she was helped by bequests and contributions from her admirers. The earl of Scarsdale left her &pound;1000 in his will, proved on 2 January 1708. Whatever Anne's actual relationship with such figures, she maintained a reputation for modesty. Aston called her &#145;that <i>Diana</i> of the Stage&#146;, and even suggested that her chaste behaviour had financial rewards:<blockquote>The Dukes of Dorset and Devonshire, Lord Hallifax, and other Nobles, over a Bottle, were all extolling Mrs. Bracegirdle's virtuous Behaviour, <i>Come</i>, says Lord <i>Hallifax</i>,&#151;<i>You all commend her Virtue, &amp;c. but why do we not present this incomparable woman with something worthy her Acceptance</i>? His Lordship deposited 200 Guineas, which the rest made up 800, and sent her with Encomiums on her Virtue. (Aston, 10)</blockquote>As Gildon has his Critick quip, she &#145;has got more money by dissembling her Lewdness, than others by professing it&#146;  (Gildon, 70). When Mrs Barry died she left Anne &pound;220 in her will, to preserve her from &#145;any debt of the Playhouse&#146;, which implies that Mrs Bracegirdle may still have had a financial interest in the theatre, although she appeared to spend the remaining thirty-nine years of her life out of the public eye. In the early 1740s she moved from Howard Street to the home of Mr Chute, where she died on Monday 12 September 1748. She was buried at Westminster Abbey on 18 September. In her will she left &pound;10 to the poor, &pound;400 to her nephew Justinian, and &pound;100 to Mrs Ann Hodge, spinster. The remainder she left to her niece Martha.<br>
