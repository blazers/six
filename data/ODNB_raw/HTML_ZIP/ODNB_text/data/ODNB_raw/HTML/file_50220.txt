<span class="headword">Dacre,  Thomas</span>, second Baron Dacre of Gilsland  (1467&#150;1525), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was born on 25 November 1467, the eldest son of Humphrey Dacre, first Baron Dacre (<i>d</i>. 1485), and his wife, Mabel Parr (<i>d</i>. 1508). Still a minor when his father died, Thomas's wardship was granted to his mother. He was already active in northern affairs, however, and was said to have &#145;raysed the north contrye&#146; for Richard III in 1485  (Summerson, &#145;Carlisle and the English west march&#146;, 103). He quickly made his peace with Henry Tudor, who on 3 March 1486 gave him custody of the English west march, a position earlier held by his father. Dacre would hold it continuously, either as lieutenant or, from 1504, as warden, until a few months before his death. The wardenship was vital to his interests, since his principal possessions were the exposed border baronies of Burgh by Sands and Gilsland; their proximity to Scotland probably explains why Dacre was prepared to discharge the office's heavy military and administrative duties for a yearly salary of only 200 marks. In view of the region's solidly Yorkist sympathies, however, Henry VII also took care to divide authority in the north-west, appointing separate keepers for the city and castle of Carlisle (generally Sir Richard Salkeld), the lordship of Penrith (Sir Christopher Moresby), and Bewcastle (Sir John Musgrave). It was said of Dacre and Moresby that &#145;the kinges strength within the counte of Cumberland dependith in effect oonly betwixt thaym twoo&#146;  (TNA: PRO, STAC2/26/11), but the result was a struggle for power. Only following an improvement in relations with Scotland did the king's grip relax. Dacre was successively allowed to farm the shrievalty of Cumberland, Penrith (after Moresby's death in 1499), and in 1501 given charge of Carlisle.<br>
<br>The gradual reduction in royal subventions which these changes entailed threw the marchers back on their own resources. Yet initially Dacre was in no position to meet the challenge. His battle-hardened tenantry constituted a significant military resource, but his ancestral possessions were scarcely worth &pound;300 a year, even in peacetime, and Dacre's two baronies were acutely vulnerable to Scottish raids. In the long term Dacre's marriage in 1487 to Elizabeth Greystoke (1471&#150;1516), granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61298/', "Ralph Greystoke, fifth Baron Greystoke (d. 1487)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54524/', "Greystoke family")</script>], offered a solution. Greystoke was a much wealthier barony than Gilsland, and Elizabeth was heir to estates throughout the north worth some &pound;850 annually, thereby not only providing a much more certain income but also transforming Dacre's standing from impoverished border baron to regional magnate. Dacre had abducted Elizabeth, a royal ward, from the Clifford castle of Brougham, Westmorland, but later suggested that there had been a pre-contract between them. The Greystoke inheritance was also claimed by Lord Greystoke's second son, Sir John Greystoke, as heir male. The resulting succession dispute was exploited by Henry VII as a means of controlling his turbulent warden. At first he allowed both parties to secure some estates, and although the unexpected deaths of Sir John and his son in 1501 and 1508 respectively made Elizabeth sole heir, the king still extracted substantial fines for livery from Dacre in 1501, and subsequently forced him to give no less than twelve recognizances, including one in 1506 for &#145;his goode aberinge&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/1 fol. 71<i>v</i>). Dacre was also subjected to a <i>quo warranto</i> challenge to his rights and franchises in Gilsland.<br>
<br>In spite of occasional clashes Henry VII, and Henry VIII likewise in the first years of his reign, was anxious to keep the peace with Scotland. Dacre was much involved in the diplomacy to which this policy gave rise, usually through agents but sometimes in person, most strikingly when in 1504 he collaborated with James IV when the latter led a force against thieves in Eskdale; the two men played cards as well as co-operating to hang border bandits. Dacre visited the Scottish court as late as 1513 in an attempt to prevent the outbreak of war, but the failure of this pacific policy gave him much greater scope for his particular talents. Henry VIII's military ambitions were chiefly directed against France, but Scotland's &#145;auld alliance&#146; with that country automatically entailed war for England on two fronts. Dacre's wardenship of the west march had been renewed in July 1509. In 1511, with Berwick under threat, he became warden-general of all three marches, at the remarkably ungenerous salary of &pound;433 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. He distinguished himself at Flodden, leading a cavalry charge to repel a dangerous Scottish onslaught early in the battle, and as he himself later wrote, earning the hatred of the Scots afterwards &#145;by reason that I found the body of the King of Scots slain in the field&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 2/1 no. 2913). Thereafter Dacre's unrivalled knowledge of leading Scottish officials and borderers was constantly employed to keep the marches in uproar; in 1518 he was elected to the Order of the Garter for his services.<br>
<br>Except when a lieutenant and army royal came north for major campaigns, Dacre remained in charge of the English borders until 1525. He had been warden of the middle marches before (1502&#150;6), but he had no lands in the east marches, and although he was given custody of the archbishopric of York's liberty of Hexham and the Tailboys liberty of Redesdale, neither those lordships nor his own modest territorial base round Morpeth proved a match for the extensive Percy interest and connection in Northumberland. But the fifth earl of Northumberland could not win the king's trust and was excluded from border office. The more substantial gentry families, accustomed to Percy leadership, increasingly resented Dacre as an intruder, forcing him to develop closer ties with the more lawless upland squires and even with the barely controllable border clans or &#145;surnames&#146;. On the west march, by contrast, where he was the obvious choice as warden, Dacre improved his holdings and extended his <i>manred</i> by buying and retenanting strategic wastelands. He also built or strengthened key castles like Naworth, Askerton, Kirkoswald, Rockcliffe, and Drumburgh. In 1523, when he raised 4000 men for a Scottish campaign, the earl of Surrey reported that Dacre could &#145;bringe out of his contre 2 or 3000 men&#146; to strengthen the east marches and may &#145;at all tymes with litle charge have 4 or 5000 men off his owne&#146; to resist invasion, &#145;and so can noone other man doo&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 4.12, 29, 51, 54). Yet despite this emphasis on military service rather than rents from his tenantry, Dacre's estates still yielded over &pound;1500 per annum, making him the eighth most wealthy English peer.<br>
<br>Dacre was still active on the borders in the early 1520s. In September 1522 he kept his nerve when a substantial Scottish army under the duke of Albany threatened to attack Cumberland, playing for time at first by claiming to be unable to read Albany's letters, which were written in French, and eventually persuading the Scots to withdraw. Wolsey, aware of the weaknesses of Carlisle's defences, saw their retreat as a miracle. A year later there was another invasion scare, and Dacre mustered the men of the west march, but in the end the Scots attacked in the east. By 1524, however, Dacre was pleading to be discharged from his increasingly unwelcome duties in Northumberland, on account of age, debility, gout, and a sore leg. But his suggestions that Henry, Lord Percy, the fifth earl's son, should succeed him were unavailing, and despairing of release he relaxed his grip on the &#145;surnames&#146;. As the marches collapsed in disorder, Dacre was summoned before the council in Star Chamber in January 1525, charged with &#145;bearinge of theaves&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 1, fol. 43). He was imprisoned, fined &pound;1000, and dismissed. Released in September, he died on the borders on 24 October 1525, killed by a fall from his horse. He was buried in his family's mausoleum in Lanercost Priory.<br>
<br>Surrey wrote of Dacre that &#145;there is no hardier or better knight&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3/2, no. 3364). Yet to say that Dacre's disgrace in 1525 &#145;marked the end of the age of the medieval robber baron&#146; is misleading  (Guy, 123), even though Tudor monarchs were henceforth distrustful of Dacre's style of marcher lordship. He was a cultured noble, with &#145;good wit and good fortune&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 4.20 n. e), who served the Tudors loyally and well for forty years. When he received Queen Margaret at Morpeth in 1515, a courtier reported that he had &#145;not sene myche a better trymmed howse of a barons house in my lyfe&#146;, and he commented enthusiastically on the plate and &#145;the hangynges of the hall and chambyrs with the newest devyse of tappestry&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 49/1, fols. 58&#150;9). Dacre was also a conscientious patron of Lanercost Priory. He contributed towards works there&#151;his arms appear on the church facade&#151;and in 1524 wrote to the convent expressing fears that the house's religious life might suffer because the prior was devoting so much time to building. Elizabeth Greystoke died in 1516, and two years later Dacre was hoping to marry the widow of Sir Christopher Pickering, but nothing came of this. His heir was his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46514/', "William Dacre")</script>, whom he matched with the fourth earl of Shrewsbury's daughter Elizabeth, and who also came to rule the west march, though without achieving the wider ascendancy that his father had enjoyed. The other children of his marriage were Humphrey, Mary (who married Shrewsbury's heir Francis Talbot), Mabel (who married Henry, seventh Lord Scrope of Bolton), and Joan. He also had an illegitimate son Thomas, founder of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71861/', "Dacre family")</script>.<br>
