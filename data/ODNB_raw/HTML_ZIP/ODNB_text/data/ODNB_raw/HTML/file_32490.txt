<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Mary Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Anodos]</span>  (1861&#150;1907), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 23 September 1861 at Hyde Park Square, London, the elder of the two daughters of Arthur Duke Coleridge and Mary Ann Jameson (<i>d</i>. 1898). Her father, the great-nephew of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772&#150;1834)")</script>, was clerk of the assize on the midland circuit; her mother's family came from Dublin.<br>
<br>Mary's parents were both keen amateur musicians. Her father held musical evenings at their home attended by singers such as Jenny Lind, and also entertained poets and painters. Tennyson, Browning (one of Mary's heroes), and Millais were all frequent visitors to their house at 12 Cromwell Place, London, though shyness often prevented Mary from speaking to them. She was educated largely at home, and at the age of twelve, intrigued by the strange shapes of Hebrew letters, asked her father to teach her the language. By nineteen she had also mastered German, French, and Italian, and had begun to teach herself Greek. Throughout her childhood she wrote verse and stories, revealing early the signs of the unique imagination which shaped her later novels and poetry.<br>
<br>Mary was tutored by her father's friend William Cory, a scholar and schoolmaster of some repute, whose career at Eton had been cut short after a scandal arose over a letter written to a favourite pupil. Cory moved to Hampstead when Mary was in her early twenties and she began to attend lessons in Greek and Latin at his home, along with a group of friends. He fondly referred to them as his &#145;Grecian Ladies&#146;  (Mackenzie, 129). A poet himself, Cory had a profound influence upon Mary.<br>
<br>By her early twenties Mary had established a close circle of female friends made up of five women from similarly sheltered backgrounds. She once declared that she found the Elizabethan idea of friendship &#145;much stronger and more sensitive, and closer to the Victorian, than anything in between&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gathered Leaves</span>, 255). When she visited Italy in 1893 she found it to be the &#145;Motherland &hellip; [she] had always longed for and never known&#146;  (ibid., 35). Poems such as &#145;The White Women&#146; and &#145;A Day-Dream&#146; echo this need for female space, mapping out imaginary or mythic territories inhabited by communities of women. On the smaller scale, other poems (&#145;Gone&#146;, &#145;Friends&#146;, &#145;Mortal Combat&#146;) chart the pleasures and pains of friendship.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty Mary had begun to write articles for periodicals such as the <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span> and <span class="italic">Merry England</span>. In 1893 her first novel, <span class="italic">The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus</span>, a fantastical romance, was published. Although the work earned praise from Robert Louis Stevenson for the &#145;devilish&#146; ingenuity  (<span class="italic">Gathered Leaves</span>, 56) of its plot, it was not a commercial success. Henry Newbolt, the young barrister with literary aspirations whom she had met when he married one of her circle, Margaret Duckworth, had become a close friend by this time. The Newbolts met regularly with Mary and another friend, Ella Coltman, to discuss work in progress. This group, facetiously nicknamed &#145;The Settee&#146; by excluded friends, witnessed the publication, in 1897, of Mary's second novel, <span class="italic">The King with Two Faces</span>. This historical romance, set in eighteenth-century Sweden, ran to several editions, firmly establishing her reputation as a novelist.<br>
<br>When the poet Robert Bridges came across the manuscript of Mary's poems, which had been purposely left lying on a hall table at his home by Mary's friend (and his wife's cousin) Violet Hodgkin, he expressed a desire to see them published. With his help, her first volume of poems, <span class="italic">Fancy's Following</span> (1896), was published, semi-privately, by the Daniel Press in Oxford. Ever aware of the long shadow cast by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, her &#145;fairy great-great-uncle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gathered Leaves</span>, 11), she refused to publish the poems in her own name, and took her pseudonym, Anodos (&#145;on no road&#146;), from George MacDonald's fairy romance <span class="italic">Phantastes</span>. Throughout her life she was to feel the mixed blessings of such a famous ancestor, and some of her best poems, such as &#145;The Witch&#146; and &#145;Wilderspin&#146;, are haunted by his presence.<br>
<br>In 1897 another volume, <span class="italic">Fancy's Guerdon</span>, was published by Elkin Matthews, and throughout the last eight years of Mary's life poems appeared in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>. During the 1890s, influenced by Tolstoy, she began teaching literature to a group of working women, first at her home and later at the Working Women's College in Fitzroy Street, London. However, she remained steadfastly opposed to the condescending attitude behind many Victorian &#145;good works&#146; and once declared her hatred of philanthropy  (<span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 71). She continued to contribute articles to the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and in 1902 began to write for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. She also published three more novels: <span class="italic">The Fiery Dawn</span> (1901), <span class="italic">The Shadow on the Wall</span> (1904), and <span class="italic">The Lady on the Drawing Room Floor</span> (1906).<br>
<br>In 1907, on the family's annual visit to Harrogate in Yorkshire, Mary suffered an attack of acute appendicitis. She died a few days later, on 25 August. During her last weeks she had been working on a biography of the Pre-Raphaelite painter Holman Hunt, which was published in 1908. Her best poems include brief, intense lyrics such as &#145;L'oiseau bleu&#146; and &#145;The Lady of Trees&#146; which seem effortlessly to convey a mood or spirit of place. Others, such as &#145;An Insincere Wish Addressed to a Beggar&#146;, offer an ironic comment on contemporary society. The late twentieth century witnessed something of a revival of critical interest in her work.<br>
