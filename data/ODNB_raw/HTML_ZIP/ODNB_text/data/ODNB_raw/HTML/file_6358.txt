<span class="headword">Corser,  Thomas</span>  (1793&#150;1876), <span class="occ">literary scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, the third son of George Corser, a banker, of Whitchurch, Shropshire, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Randall Phythian of the Higher Hall, Edge, Cheshire, was born at Whitchurch, where he was baptized on 9 July 1793. From Whitchurch School he went in 1808 to the Manchester grammar school, and in May 1812 was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, after being awarded one of the school exhibitions. He graduated BA in 1815, and MA in 1818. It was during his residence at Oxford, and through his intimacy with Dr Henry Cotton, sub-librarian of the Bodleian, that his love of early English poetry and Elizabethan literature was formed and his bibliographical tastes encouraged. In 1816 he was ordained to the curacy of Condover, near Shrewsbury, and in the following year received priest's orders, holding also the chaplaincy of Atcham Union at Berrington. From 1819 to 1826 he served as curate of the various parishes of Stone, Staffordshire, of Monmouth, and of Prestwich, near Manchester. In 1826, while curate of Prestwich, he obtained the incumbency of All Saints' Church, Stand, Manchester, where he continued for nearly fifty years. By his care and exertions the parish was early supplied with large and flourishing schools. He married on 24 November 1828 Ellen Lyon, the eldest daughter of the Revd James Lyon, rector of Prestwich.<br>
<br>Corser was one of the founders of the Chetham Society in 1843. Of the four works edited by Corser for the society&#151;Chester's <span class="italic">Triumph</span> (1844), <span class="italic">Iter Lancastrense</span> (1845), Robinson's <span class="italic">Golden Mirrour</span>, and <span class="italic">Collectanea Anglo-poetica</span>&#151;the most important are the <span class="italic">Iter</span> and the <span class="italic">Collectanea</span>. The first is an interesting account by Richard James, in verse, of his visit to Lancashire in 1636, amplified by the editor's research and diligence. The second is an alphabetical account, with extracts from each author, and elaborate biographical and bibliographical notices, of the editor's magnificent collection of early English poetry, which he had begun to form at an early age. The first part was issued in 1860. Corser's advanced age and infirmities interfered with the progress of the undertaking on the original scale beyond the letter C, and it was concluded at the fourth part (1869). But six further parts (1873&#150;1880) were subsequently issued on a briefer plan. Corser died after the fifth part was published in 1873, and James Crossley edited the remainder. The work was a very valuable contribution to English bibliography, and the collection of books which formed its basis was sold in London in portions at different dates, from July 1868 to 1874, realizing upwards of &pound;20,000. Corser was also a member of the Spenser, Camden, Surtees, Percy, and Shakespeare societies, and was elected FSA in 1850. In 1867 he suffered from an attack of paralysis; his eyesight failed, and he could write only with his left hand. He died at the Stand rectory on 24 August 1876, aged eighty-three. His wife had died on 25 April 1859, but at least one son and one daughter survived them.<br>
