<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wright,  Esmond</span>  (1915&#150;2003), <span class="occ">historian and politician</span>, was born at 142 Hugh Gardens, Benwell, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 5 November 1915, the son of Esmond Wright, armature winder and later electrical engineer, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray. His parents were both Scottish. From Heaton grammar school he secured an open scholarship to King's College, Newcastle, then part of the University of Durham, from which he graduated with first-class honours in 1937. A graduate scholarship beckoned at New College, Oxford, but he chose instead to take up a Commonwealth Fund fellowship at the University of Virginia, where his intellectual encounter with the world of Thomas Jefferson and the American War of Independence did much to shape his career. Here, too, began his lifelong fascination with American politics.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Wright abandoned plans for a doctorate at the University of Virginia, and settled for a master's degree. This was conferred by Franklin Delano Roosevelt on 10 June 1940. The American president, responding to Mussolini's declaration of war on Britain and France the same day, delivered his celebrated &#145;hand that held the dagger&#146; speech, and joined with the audience in a gesture of solidarity with Wright, the lone British student present. Sailing back to England, Wright arrived in Liverpool during an air-raid, &#145;with shrapnel falling like heavy confetti on the deck&#146;  (Wright, &#145;The origin of American studies&#146;, 295). He joined the army as a private, declining an offer to lecture to troops. After square-bashing with the King's Own Yorkshire light infantry he served in Egypt and the Middle East, first in the intelligence corps, where he was commissioned, and later, after the shooting stopped, in the Royal Army Education Corps. He reached north Africa in time for El Alamein. Back in England, on 16 November 1945 at a Unitarian ceremony in Newcastle, he married Olive Adamson, the 27-year-old daughter of William Adamson, marine engineer. In a close, lifelong, but childless partnership he would draw on her devoted support.<br>
<br>Following his demobilization in 1946 as a lieutenant-colonel, Wright went to Glasgow University as a lecturer in modern history, &#145;at a vastly lower salary &hellip; than that of an acting full colonel&#146;  (Wright, &#145;The origin of American studies&#146;, 295). Drawn increasingly to teaching the history of the United States, and having written on George Washington and the era of the War of Independence, he was appointed professor of modern history in 1957, the first historian of America to hold a general chair of history in Britain. He captivated students with an inimitable lecturing style, graceful in both word and gesture (&#145;a gentle deft twist of his upraised right hand slowly descending&#146;; <span class="italic">BAAS Newsletter</span>). In both teaching and scholarship his forte was synthesis. <span class="italic">Fabric of Freedom</span> (1961), an elegant survey of the American War of Independence, won plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic. One of the twelve founding fathers of the British Association for American Studies in 1955, Wright served as its secretary (though he was not a model of administrative efficiency, and was known to mislay applications for membership) and later chairman, to which post he brought &#145;a wonderfully relaxed, informal manner and an effortless personal charm which made it almost impossible to have an argument with him, or persist in any kind of grievance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>).<br>
<br>A professor at forty-two, Wright was concerned about what he would do with the rest of his life. He chose to become a pioneer &#145;media don&#146;, reaching out to a middlebrow audience, writing reviews and leaders for the Glasgow <span class="italic">Herald</span> (he was later its deputy chairman), and broadcasting on radio and television, where he was noted for his courteous and even-handed interviews with politicians. A Conservative himself, but of conciliatory bent and with no strong political ambitions, he surprised many when in 1967 he stood in a parliamentary by-election in the safe Labour seat of Glasgow Pollok. Even more surprisingly, he won, chiefly because tory support held firm while the popular Scottish Nationalist candidate squeezed the Labour vote. A grammar-school Conservative who personified the &#145;new&#146; tory of the Edward Heath era, Wright found it hard to adjust to Westminster. But his academic associates especially valued his role in preventing the British government withdrawing its funding of the Fulbright programme of scholarly transatlantic exchange. Labour's recapture of Pollok at the general election of 1970 left him &#145;dejected&#146; but not regretful  (Wright, &#145;Reflections on not being an MP&#146;, 78). From 1972 to 1976 he served as principal of the Conservative College at Swinton, but he harboured no further major political ambitions himself.<br>
<br>Returning to academic life, as director of the Institute of United States Studies and professor of American history at the University of London (1971&#150;83), Wright encouraged a collaborative research project on the loyalists of the revolutionary era, sought to preserve the institute in the face of Conservative government spending cuts, and continued to write. Beyond academia, he acted as vice-chairman of Border Television from 1976, and later as chairman (1981&#150;5). Bizarrely, since he was neither a car-owner nor a driver, he served as treasurer and vice-chairman of the Automobile Association from 1971 to 1985, and subsequently as its vice-president.<br>
<br>In retirement in Masham, Yorkshire, his Georgian house swollen with books, Wright wrote his best work of scholarship, the culmination of twenty years' study: an elegantly written biography, <span class="italic">Franklin of Philadelphia</span> (1986), for which he was honoured with the Franklin medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1988. Knocked down on a pedestrian crossing in Bloomsbury, he survived the terrible accident, but during the final fifteen years of his life never fully recovered his mental vigour. He found question-and-answer sessions difficult and lost his discipline in writing. An old-fashioned approach and alleged slipshod historical practice meant that his three-volume history of the United States&#151;<span class="italic">The Search for Liberty</span>; <span class="italic">An Empire for Liberty</span>; <span class="italic">The American Dream</span> (1995&#150;6)&#151;was an achievement of sorts but not a great success. He died on 9 August 2003 in Rutson Hospital, High Street, Northallerton, Yorkshire, of pneumonia and degenerative vascular disease. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Whether or not his early appointment to a chair was the result of his having had &#145;a good war&#146; (the suggestion of a fellow pioneer of American studies in Britain, Harry Allen), Wright's genial professorial presence, impeccable elegance, disarming charm, personal warmth, &#145;unobtrusive sharp eye&#146;  (<span class="italic">BAAS Newsletter</span>), and realism&#151;along with his contribution as an eloquent lecturer and elegant writer&#151;made him a most effective communicator within and without the ivory tower. He was an attractive spokesman for the first generation of professional Americanists in Britain. He wrote much, but would not have quarrelled with the judgement that he was &#145;not a dedicated research scholar&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). His historical writings emphasized the biographical and the contingent, an approach influenced by his wartime experience and&#151;earlier still&#151;by his reading of Acton, Lecky, and Namier. His scholarly distrust of ideology, revolutionary blueprints, and grand schemes was equally a feature of his politics. The next generation of British-based scholars of the American past found much of his writing rather old-fashioned, but they did so within a framework of acceptance of American studies in Britain that Wright and his generation had done much to create.<br>
