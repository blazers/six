<span class="headword">Taylor,  Alfred Swaine</span>  (1806&#150;1880), <span class="occ">medical jurist and toxicologist</span>, born at Northfleet, Kent, on 11 December 1806, was the eldest son of Thomas Taylor, a captain in the East India Company's maritime service, and his first wife, Susan Mary, daughter of Charles Badger, manufacturer of gun flints, a member of an old Kentish family. Taylor was privately educated at Dr Benson's school, Albemarle House, Hounslow, and in June 1822 he was apprenticed to Mr D. Macrae, a medical practitioner at Lenham, near Maidstone, Kent. In October 1823 he was entered as a student at the united hospitals of Guy's and St Thomas's, London where he took a particular interest in chemistry taught by William Allen and Arthur Aikin. He spent the summer of 1825 in Paris, and on his return to London received the anatomical prize at St Thomas's. On the separation of the two hospitals he attached himself to Guy's studying under Sir Astley Cooper and Joseph Henry Green, gaining a reputation for his knowledge of physiology.<br>
<br>Taylor became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries of London in 1828 and then embarked upon a tour of the medical schools of Europe. In Paris he attended the lectures of the toxicologist Matthieu Joseph Bonaventura Orfila, the surgeon Guillaume Dupuytren and the chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac. Taylor spent time in the Auvergne, where he prepared a note on the geology of the Puy de D&ocirc;me which was published in the <span class="italic">London Medical and Physical Journal</span>. He visited the medical school at Montpellier before boarding a ship for Naples, which he reached after a stormy and perilous voyage. At one stage of his journey Taylor was arrested for having dangerous books in his possession and he was to be arrested again on his homeward journey, this time as a suspected spy, after sketching the fortifications near Brescia.<br>
<br>Taylor stayed in Naples for nine months and wrote two articles on physiology which were published in the <span class="italic">Giornale Medico Napolitano</span>. His account of the Grotta de' Cani, notorious for its suffocating fumes, was later published in the <span class="italic">London Medical and Physical Journal</span>. The overland journey home, much of it on foot, began in February 1829. He travelled through Italy, Switzerland, the Tyrol, Germany, and the Low Countries visiting medical schools in Rome, Florence, Bologna, Milan, Heidelberg, Leiden, Amsterdam, and Brussels. He spent the winter of 1829&#150;1830 at Guy's Hospital and became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in March 1830. A third visit to Paris was made in the summer of 1830 at the time of the revolution and Taylor was able to study gunshot wounds and their treatment by the surgeons Jacques Manec and Jacques Lisfranc at La Piti&eacute;.<br>
<br>The visits to Paris had aroused Taylor's interest in forensic medicine at the time when the Society of Apothecaries made the subject a requirement for its licentiate diploma. In 1831 Taylor was appointed to the newly created post of lecturer of medical jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital, and he held the post as professor until 1877. His inaugural course of lectures was attended by some leading members of the bar and some judges. Taylor was particularly interested in the application of chemistry to medicine and in 1832 he was appointed joint lecturer in chemistry at Guy's with Arthur Aikin: from 1851 until his resignation in 1870 he held the chair in chemistry alone. In July 1834 he married Caroline, only daughter of John Cancellor, a London stockbroker; they had one child, a daughter, Edith.<br>
<br>In 1836 Taylor published the first volume of <span class="italic">Elements of Medical Jurisprudence</span>, but finding that the scale of the work would require four volumes he rearranged the subject matter to provide a more convenient and practical guide for the medical jurist. The revised work, <span class="italic">A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence</span>, was published in 1844 and went through ten editions in Taylor's lifetime. In 1848 he published <span class="italic">Poisons in Relation to Medical Jurisprudence and Medicine</span> which like the earlier <span class="italic">Manual</span> presented codified legal precedents and rulings together with relevant, anatomical, clinical, and chemical data. Taylor's <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence</span> appeared in 1865; a second edition in two volumes followed in 1873. These books became standard works and established Taylor as the major contributor to the professional establishment of medical jurisprudence. He contributed a regular series of articles on medico-legal cases to the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> and to the <span class="italic">London Medical Gazette</span>, acting as editor of the latter between 1844 and 1851. Taylor became FRS (1845), MRCP (1848), and FRCP (1853). In 1852 he received the honorary degree of MD from the University of St Andrews, and in 1859, in recognition of his writings on medical jurisprudence, he was awarded the Swiney prize by the Society of Arts.<br>
<br>By the mid-1850s Taylor had been consulted on about five hundred medico-legal cases and was recognized as a leading medical jurist. His public reputation was built upon his appearances as an expert witness in a number of highly publicized murder trials. As a toxicologist Taylor's experience was equalled only by Robert Christison, and he appeared as a witness for the prosecution in a number of trials for suspected murder by poisoning, becoming in time adviser to the Treasury in cases of particular difficulty. By combining legal precedent and judicial ruling with chemical and anatomical evidence he established forensic toxicology as a medical specialism. The most notable trial in which he appeared was that of William Palmer, who was accused of murdering John Parsons Cook with strychnine. Taylor's evidence, and the criticism of it by Sergeant Robert Shee for the defence, were widely reported. After Palmer's execution Taylor published an assessment of the evidence in <span class="italic">On poisoning by strychnia, with comments on the medical evidence at the trial of William Palmer for the murder of John Parsons Cook</span> (1856).<br>
<br>The controversial trials of Palmer in 1856 and Dr Thomas Smethurst in 1859 did much to influence Taylor's opinions concerning the nature and use of medical evidence in murder trials. Early in his career Taylor had been aware of problems posed by medical evidence. In the first edition of his <span class="italic">Manual</span> he laid down the principle that it was the task of the jury to decide the verdict and that the medical jurist must, in doubtful cases, refrain from devoting his energies to only one side of the question. His subsequent experience in poisoning cases led him to conclude that analytical results, obtained by the imperfect methods of his time, provided only a certain degree of probability and where admitted as evidence should be used only to supplement the medical observations. The uncertainties were such that he opposed the system of engaging medical witnesses for prosecution and defence and he advocated instead a system of assessments by independent medical experts.<br>
<br>Taylor was also a pioneer of photography and devised improvements in the fixing and printing processes used by William Henry Fox Talbot. He described his methods in his <span class="italic">On the Art of Photogenic Drawing</span> (1840). He also had an interest in thermometry and published two works on the subject, <span class="italic">A thermometric table on the scales of fahrenheit, centigrade and Reaumur, compressing the most remarkable phenomena connected with temperature</span> (1845) and <span class="italic">On the Temperature of the Earth and Sea in Reference to the Theory of Central Heat</span> (1846). He revised and edited <span class="italic">A New Treatise of the Use of Globes</span> by Thomas Keith (1848), and in 1853 assisted George Owen Rees in editing the final part of <span class="italic">The Elements of Materia medica and Therapeutics</span>, which was left incomplete by the death of Jonathan Pereira. In 1863 he and George Brande published <span class="italic">Chemistry</span> and in 1876 he published an edited version of <span class="italic">Elements of Physics</span> by Neil Arnott.<br>
<br>Taylor was described as a man of commanding stature who was calm and earnest in his manner. He was an accomplished amateur artist, had a knowledge of Latin and Greek, and was fluent in French, Italian, and German. He was said to be a man of quiet domestic traits and rarely to be seen at medical social events. Taylor lived in almost complete retirement in his last years and died of heart disease on 27 May 1880 at his home, 15 St James's Terrace, Regent's Park, London.<br>
