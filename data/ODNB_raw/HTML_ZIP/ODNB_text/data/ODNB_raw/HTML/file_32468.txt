<span class="headword">Cobbe, Sir  Alexander Stanhope</span>  (1870&#150;1931), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Naini Tal, North-Western Provinces, India, on 5 June 1870, the second son of Lieutenant-General Sir Alexander Hugh Cobbe (1825&#150;1899), 17th regiment, and his wife, Emily Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1886), daughter of Captain G. Stanhope Jones, 59th regiment. He was educated at Wellington College and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Having been commissioned in the South Wales Borderers in 1889, he was promoted lieutenant in 1892 but transferred to the Indian Staff Corps that year, his appointment being confirmed in 1894. He was attached to the 32nd Sikh pioneers, with whom he saw active service in Chitral in 1895, taking part in Colonel F. H. Kelly's great march to the relief of the agency. He subsequently served in Nyasaland in 1898 and 1899 in various minor operations and with the West African regiment in the Asante kingdom in 1900, was wounded, and awarded the DSO. He was again on active service in 1902, in Somaliland, and won the VC at Erego on 6 October for good work with a Maxim gun when left alone in front of the line at a critical moment, while later he went out under heavy fire and brought in a wounded man. He had received his captaincy in 1900 and was promoted major and brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1907. Cobbe married on 1 October 1910 Winifred Ada (<i>d</i>. 1956), eldest daughter of Sir Albert Edward Bowen, first baronet, of Colworth Park, Bedfordshire; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Between 1902 and 1914 Cobbe held several staff appointments in India and at the War Office and was made aide-de-camp to the king and brevet colonel in 1911. He went to France in October 1914 as general staff officer of the Lahore division, was transferred to the staff of the Indian corps in June 1915, and was later brigadier-general, general staff, 1st corps. Cobbe returned to India in January 1916 as director of staff duties and military training; he took over the Meerut 7th Indian division in Mesopotamia in the following June, becoming major-general, and two months later succeeded General Sir Stanley Maude in the 3rd Indian corps, which he commanded in the operations of December 1916&#150;February 1917 for the recapture of Kut al-Amara, being particularly concerned with the clearance of the Khudhaira bend and the capture of the Sannaiyat position. He was later in charge of the operations which resulted in substantial success at Mashahida (March 1917) and Istabulat and the capture of Samarra (April) and also of the advance to Tikrit in October. In 1918 his corps carried out the advance upon Mosul which culminated after sharp fighting at Sharqat and on the Lesser Zab in the surrender of the main Turkish field force. Difficulties of supply and transport were great but Cobbe's plans resulted in an outstanding success.<br>
<br>Cobbe was appointed CB in 1915, KCB in 1917, CSI in 1918, and KCSI in 1919, the year in which he also became lieutenant-general. From October 1919 to June 1920 and from 1920 to 1926 he was military secretary at the India Office; he was general officer commanding-in-chief, northern command, in India from 1926 to 1930, and had returned to his old post at the India Office shortly before he died. He had been promoted full general in February 1924, being the youngest holder of that rank in the army, and was made aide-de-camp general to the king and appointed GCB in 1928. To the great pleasure of his old regiment he had been made colonel of the South Wales Borderers in 1922. An accomplished, as well as a gallant and popular, soldier, he had a fine record both as a staff officer and in command in the field and he inspired confidence as well as liking and respect. He died at 7 Portland Place, Marylebone, London, after an operation, on 29 June 1931. His son, an officer in the RAF, was killed in action during the battle of Britain in 1940. His younger daughter became a fellow and tutor in mathematics at Somerville College, Oxford.<br>
