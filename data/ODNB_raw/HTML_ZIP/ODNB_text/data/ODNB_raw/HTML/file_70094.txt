<span class="headword">Bradley,  Caroline Frances</span>  (1946&#150;1983), <span class="occ">showjumper</span>, was born on 4 April 1946 at North Oxford Nursing Home, 165 Banbury Road, Oxford, the younger daughter of John Thomas (Tom) Bradley, chartered surveyor and land agent, and (Frances) Doreen Good. She and her older sister, Judith, learned to ride at an early age and owned a succession of ponies. When she was six Caroline became a member of the Oakley pony club and later the Grafton Hunt pony club, progressing from basic riding skills and stable management to junior showjumping competitions. By the time she was fifteen she had graduated to horses and was exhibiting the determination and will to win that were a hallmark of her life. She was also a talented hockey player, representing her county during her years at Northampton High School for Girls, but she gave up the sport to concentrate on showjumping.<br>
<br>Bradley's next major decision was whether to continue her academic studies or to pursue a riding career. After completing her A levels her parents agreed that she could have two years to develop her equestrian skills and she undertook eighteen months as a working pupil at the Waterstock House Training Centre, Oxfordshire, run by Lars Sederholm. It was here that she gained a grounding in the essential riding techniques that later made her one of the most technically correct riders in the sport. She then began to compete on the British grade A showjumping circuit and made her international d&eacute;but at the Dublin horse show in 1966 riding Robert Hanson's Franco, the horse on which she achieved much of her early success. They were part of the victorious British team at the nations' cup in Leipzig the following year and by the time she won the civilian open championship at Toronto in 1968 she was being hailed in the press as the natural successor to Pat Smythe, Britain's most famous female showjumper. Demonstrating great versatility, she also competed in the Badminton horse trials in 1969 on Alpaca, a horse belonging to Lars Sederholm, her former trainer.<br>
<br>The life of an international showjumper in the late 1960s was not easy for a young woman in a sport dominated largely by men. Like all riders, Bradley took many crunching falls, suffering concussion and numerous broken bones. Her confidence in the ring belied her natural shyness and she found it difficult to deal with the publicity that accompanied success. In order to make ends meet she had to teach, take liveries, and train young horses for other people; she even took part in a television commercial for margarine to augment her income. She always drove her own horsebox around the country, clocking up thousands of miles at the wheel, as she never trusted others to take care of her precious horses. She also had to endure the disappointments of being omitted from the 1972 Olympic team and subsequently finding herself ineligible for Olympic competition because she rode horses belonging to others: in the eyes of the authorities this made her professional.<br>
<br>Undaunted, Bradley continued to ride during the next decade, becoming the first female winner of the puissance at the horse of the year show in 1974 and the only woman to compete in the newly amalgamated men's and women's world championships at Aachen in 1978, at which she helped the British team to win a gold medal. She won team gold again the following year at the European championships in Rotterdam and, overall, represented Britain on twelve winning nations' cup teams in a seventeen-year international career. As an individual she won the grand prix at Hickstead in 1980 and the Queen Elizabeth II cup&#151;the UK women's showjumping championship&#151;on her two most famous horses, John Harding's stallion Marius in 1978 and the grey gelding Tigre in 1980. She also found time to support charities such as Riding for the Disabled. At the height of her success she was elected <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> sportswoman of the year in 1979, alongside sportsman Sebastian Coe, and was made an MBE in 1980. To many young girl riders she was a sporting heroine.<br>
<br>Showjumping, however, is a partnership and a rider's success is ultimately dependent on her horses. Bradley's last year in the top flight was 1980. With Marius retired from the jumping arena, she was dealt a severe blow when Donald Bannocks, co-owner of Tigre, decided unexpectedly to sell him. Initially it appeared that she would continue to ride the horse but when she signed a sponsorship deal with oil company Tricentrol he was removed from her stables, leaving her without any top-class rides. Always a professional and dedicated horsewoman, she began to work even longer hours to bring on her string of youngsters (who included the future champion Milton), regularly taking nine horses to shows. Her fellow showjumper David Broome recalled that she drove herself unbelievably hard. According to her biographer her determination to reach the top again and her sense of responsibility towards her sponsors changed her from a hard worker to a workaholic.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1983 Bradley was competing in the Suffolk show at Ipswich when she became unwell after jumping a round. She collapsed and died shortly afterwards. A coroner's inquest concluded that she had suffered heart failure, brought on by cardiac arrhythmia or acute acceleration of the heart rate. She was thirty-seven and unmarried. In the opinion of Dorian Williams, the well-respected BBC commentator, she was perhaps the most skilled woman rider in the world.<br>
