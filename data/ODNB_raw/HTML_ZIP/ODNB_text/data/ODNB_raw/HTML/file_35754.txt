<span class="headword">Ridley,  Matthew White</span>, first Viscount Ridley  (1842&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at 10 Carlton House Terrace, London, on 25 July 1842, was the elder son in a family of two sons and one daughter of Sir Matthew White Ridley, fourth baronet (1807&#150;1877), of Blagdon, Northumberland, tory MP for North Northumberland. His mother was Cecilia Anne, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21283/', "James Parke, Baron Wensleydale")</script>. Ridley's mother died of tuberculosis in 1845 and his childhood at Blagdon was lonely and severe. At Harrow (1856&#150;61) he was in the football and shooting elevens and became captain of the school. In 1860 he gained a classical scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, and he matriculated on 12 October 1861. After taking a first class in classical moderations in 1863 and in the final classical school in 1865, he was elected a fellow of All Souls; he was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1864. His cousin Louisa Knightley described him in 1866 as &#145;rather handsome and exceedingly clever &hellip; [with] the extremely decided opinions of a very young, clever man who has lived in an intellectual set at Oxford and not yet learned to say &#147;I don't know&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals of Lady Knightley</span>, 112). Ridley vacated his fellowship in 1874, after his marriage on 10 December 1873 to the Hon. Mary Georgiana (<i>d</i>. 1899), eldest daughter of Dudley Coutts Marjoribanks, first Baron Tweedmouth, with whom he had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Destined for a political career, Ridley in 1868 succeeded his father as Conservative MP for North Northumberland, a seat he held until 1885. On his father's death in 1877 he succeeded as fifth baronet and owner of the family estates of over 10,000 acres. He was under-secretary to the Home Office from 1878 to 1880 in Beaconsfield's administration. From September 1885 to January 1886 he was financial secretary to the Treasury under Lord Salisbury. Meanwhile the <span class="roman">Reform and Redistribution Acts</span> of 1884 and 1885 changed the Northumberland constituencies, enfranchising nonconformist farmers and coal-miners; at the general elections in November 1885 and July 1886 he unsuccessfully stood for Hexham and Newcastle upon Tyne respectively. In August 1886 a by-election at Blackpool gave him an opening; he won, and retained the seat until he was raised to the peerage in 1900. Ridley did not receive office in the Salisbury government of 1886&#150;92. He chaired the royal commission on civil establishments (1886&#150;89), the so-called &#145;Ridley commission&#146; which inquired into the work and organization of the Home Office. He was considered for the office of postmaster-general in the minor reshuffle of 1891, but he was not offered the job: Salisbury may have been dissuaded from promoting him by A. J. Balfour. A loyal party man, Ridley was on the squirearchical side of the party and he did not belong to the inner circle of Cecils and Souls. He was sworn of the privy council in 1892.<br>
<br>Although Ridley took little part in the debates of the house, he won its respect, and on 10 April 1895 he was put forward as the Conservative candidate for the speakership. On a division the Liberal candidate W. C. Gully was elected by 285 votes against 274 for Ridley. When Salisbury returned to office on 25 June 1895 Ridley became home secretary in the new government, holding the post until the dissolution of 1900. Ridley's administration of the Home Office was thoroughly safe and consequently attracted little attention. In 1897, when he released from prison some men convicted of dynamite outrages, he defended himself effectively against an attack from his own side, led by Henry Howorth and James Lowther. His most illustrious charge was Oscar Wilde, who was a prisoner in 1895&#150;7; Ridley agreed to Wilde's requests for books, but he refused him early release. The appointment of his brother as a High Court judge in 1897 was unfortunate; Edward Ridley was a poor judge and his appointment exposed the home secretary to the charge of jobbery. Ridley was one of the two ministers to leave office when Salisbury reconstituted his government after the 1900 election (the other was Henry Chaplin). Ridley's dismissal was sometimes attributed to the malign influence of Balfour, but it seems likely that the decision was Salisbury's alone. On leaving office Ridley received a viscountcy. His last years were mainly spent at Blagdon.<br>
<br>True to his family tradition, Ridley was always active in the administration of his property. Known as an extremely capable man of business, he was long a director of the North Eastern Railway, and on the resignation of Sir Joseph Pease in 1902 he became chairman. He especially devoted himself to the development of the town of Blyth, which, originally part of the estates of the Radcliffe family but forfeited to the crown after the rising of 1715, had descended to Ridley with the other estates of Matthew White. After succeeding to the baronetcy in 1877, he carried a bill through parliament for the creation of a board of commissioners with powers to develop Blyth; as chairman of this board Ridley soon transformed the harbour and dock, from which (being principal proprietor) Ridley benefited largely, reviving his family fortunes at a time of agricultural depression. He contrived, however, that the inhabitants should share in the prosperity: he gave an open space for public recreation, which in 1904 he opened as the Ridley Park; he gave sites for a mechanics' institute, a church, and a hospital; and he was occupied until his death on a large scheme of planting trees in convenient places. Ridley was chairman of the Northumberland quarter sessions from 1873, and of the county council from 1889; but he resigned both offices in 1895 when he became home secretary. He joined the Royal Agricultural Society in 1869 and was its president in 1888, when the meeting was at Nottingham. He was also president of the National Union of Conservative Associations. He served as deputy lieutenant and JP for Northumberland and provincial grand master of freemasons for Northumberland (1885&#150;1900), and he commanded the Northumberland yeomanry from 1886 to 1895. He was ecclesiastical commissioner for England in 1895&#150;1904.<br>
<br>Ridley died at Blagdon on 28 November 1904, and was buried there. He was succeeded as viscount by his elder son, Matthew (1874&#150;1916), Conservative MP for Stalybridge (1900&#150;04) and chairman of the Tariff Reform League. His second son, Jaspar, became chairman of Coutts's Bank.<br>
<br>Ridley is remembered as being &#145;fairly stuffy and a huge eater&#146;, but his portly country gentleman's exterior masked disappointed ambition. It is to his credit that he advanced the standing and fortunes of his family at a time of aristocratic decline, leaving the Ridleys as second only to the Percys in Northumberland; but his political career failed to fulfil the promise of his youthful academic brilliance.<br>
