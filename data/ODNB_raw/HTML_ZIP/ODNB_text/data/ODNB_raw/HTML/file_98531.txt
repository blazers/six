<span class="headword">Bracewell, Dame  Joyanne Winifred</span>  (1934&#150;2007), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 5 July 1934 at 5 Orville Drive, Burnage, Manchester, daughter of John William Bracewell, cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibson. By the time of her birth the family was comfortably off, her father having worked his way up from humble origins to become director of a cotton manufacturing company. She was educated privately and became a talented child actor, appearing in a number of <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> productions of E. Nesbitt's plays and also in two films produced by Film Studios Manchester in 1948, <span class="italic">Cup-tie Honeymoon</span>, starring Sandy Powell, and <span class="italic">Holidays with Pay</span>, starring Frank Randle and Tessa O'Shea. No doubt this experience contributed to the beautiful voice and outstandingly clear diction that she later deployed in court.<br>
<br>Bracewell studied law at the University of Manchester, from which she graduated LLB in 1954 and LLM in 1956. She was one of the law faculty's star students of the early 1950s (her achievements were later recognized with an LLD degree in 1991). Perhaps it was her early acting career that drew her to a career at the bar. This was still an inhospitable place for a woman, despite the pioneering example of Rose Heilbron, with whom she had brains, beauty, courage, and determination in common. She was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1955, did pupillage with Godfrey Heilpern (later leader of the northern circuit) from 1955 to 1956, and became a tenant in his chambers, then at 60 King Street in Manchester. Women were not then allowed to attend the bar mess dinners, where men were elected to the circuit, and were elected at the &#145;business court&#146; instead. By dint of ability and sheer hard work, she built up a strong common law practice. It is reputed that such was her dedication to work that one day, unusually, she asked her colleagues whether her undefended divorce cases could be taken ahead of theirs because she was getting married that day. True or not, it was certainly in character. She married Roy Copeland, a 34-year-old textile merchant (son of Jack Copeland, also a textile merchant), on 12 September 1963, at Manchester register office. They adopted a son in 1965 and a daughter in 1967.<br>
<br>After her marriage and the arrival of her children Bracewell continued her career without interruption. She was an inspiration to the women who followed her to the Manchester bar, including Brenda Hale in 1969 and Janet Smith in 1972. She took silk in 1978 and became head of her chambers, masterminding the move to their own premises at 28 St John Street. She was appointed a recorder in 1975 and a circuit judge on the northern circuit in 1983, transferring to the western circuit in 1986. She and Roy bought a large and beautiful house and garden in Somerset, which they ran as a guest house. Roy was also a talented jazz musician, playing both saxophone and clarinet, and their hospitality both in Manchester and in Somerset was legendary.<br>
<br>Bracewell's &#145;big break&#146; came with the passing of the <span class="roman">Children Act</span> 1989. The lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, recruited her to help with the implementation of the act and to act as its ambassador in winning over the &#145;hearts and minds&#146; of those who would have to make it work on the ground. She was a great success. In 1990 she was rightly rewarded with promotion to the High Court (and the accompanying appointment of DBE), only the fifth woman (after Elizabeth Lane, Rose Heilbron, Margaret Booth, and Elizabeth Butler-Sloss) to hold that office. She was also family division liaison judge for London from 1990 to 1997 and chaired the Children Act Advisory Committee from 1993 to 1997. She was responsible for the invaluable <span class="italic">Annual Report</span> and <span class="italic">Handbook of Best Practice in Children Act Cases</span> (1997). She was consulting editor of <span class="italic">Family Court Practice</span> and of <span class="italic">Butterworth's Family Law Service</span>.<br>
<br>In court Bracewell was known for her &#145;air of quiet authority, a measured approach, great courtesy of manner, and an almost superhuman power to maintain those qualities when faced with difficult or emotional litigants, or insensitivity on the part of any advocate who appeared before her&#146;  (Potter, memorial address). She was a tough judge, expecting the same high standards of others&#151;be they local authorities in their child protection work or parents in the care of their children&#151;as she expected of herself. She hit the headlines in 2004 with an open-court judgment transferring children from the care of their mother to their father because the mother had obstructed their contact with him. She took an even stronger line when she transferred the care of two children born to a lesbian couple from their birth mother to their other mother, because of the birth mother's attempts to deny the importance of the children's relationship with their other mother and her son. (Unusually, in that case the law lords thought she had been too tough.) She supported proposals for early intervention, to nip such problems in the bud before they escalated into a court dispute, and also for more flexible and constructive approaches to enforcing contact orders once made, which were implemented in the <span class="roman">Children and Adoption Act</span> 2006.<br>
<br>Tough she may have been, but Joyanne Bracewell was also friendly and approachable, enjoying the company of other family lawyers at Family Law Bar Association conferences (where she would label herself Joyanne rather than Mrs Justice Bracewell). She was unfailingly cheerful and optimistic, continuing to work for as long as she possibly could during her final illness. This she faced with typical courage&#151;the same courage with which she faced a frustrated litigant who threatened the Court of Appeal with a (convincing replica) gun. She and her fellow judges then had the unusual experience of giving evidence at the Old Bailey, where she had also sat as a judge. She died of breast cancer on 9 January 2007 at St Margaret's Hospice, Yeovil, Somerset, and was survived by her husband, Roy, and their two children. A celebration of her life was held at Gray's Inn Hall, London, on 19 March 2007.<br>
