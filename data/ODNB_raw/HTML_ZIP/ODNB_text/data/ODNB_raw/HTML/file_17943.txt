<span class="headword">Manlove,  Timothy</span>  (1663&#150;1699), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and author</span>, was born on 18 November 1663 at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17942/', "Edward Manlove (bap. 1615, d. 1671)")</script>, gentleman and minor poet, and his second wife, Timothee, daughter of John Pearce of Lewes, Sussex. He began a career as a physician, in which &#145;he had attained to a great skill &hellip; and practised it with Ease&#146;  (Gilpin), before deciding on the ministry. He was educated at John Woodhouse's academy at Sheriffhales, Shropshire, and received Presbyterian ordination at Attercliffe on 11 September 1688. He then served as a private chaplain to the family of Sir Philip Gell of Hopton Hall, Derbyshire, who regarded him with more than ordinary kindness. His marriage to Sarah Slater (<i>d</i>. 1715) on 18 July 1688 was probably the cause of his seeking a congregation.<br>
<br>Shortly after qualifying himself as a nonconformist preacher at the quarter sessions at Bakewell on 7 July 1689 under the recently passed <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, Manlove became minister at Durham. He was described there in 1690 as &#145;formerly a preacher in Derbyshire: a young man of great hopes, and usefullness, [with] an encouraging auditory&#146;  (Gordon, 36) though he had thereby gained little financial reward. At Durham he engaged in a debate with the dean, Dr Thomas Comber, who tried hard to persuade him on the terms of conformity. It was later said that his &#145;principals &amp; practices were so large at Durham that he got him respect with the church men &amp; were rather an offence to them of his own communion&#146;  (R. Stretton to R. Thoresby, 13 March 1697, Yorkshire Archaeological Society, MS 16). In June 1693 he accepted an invitation from the congregation at Pontefract, Yorkshire, to settle with them, but following the death of Thomas Sharpe, minister of the Presbyterian congregation at Mill Hill, Leeds, in September 1693, he was invited to become their minister. The congregation at Pontefract strongly resisted his leaving, and Manlove at first declined; but, after further application from Leeds and much irresolution on his part, he was finally persuaded in February 1694 by Richard Gilpin, the minister at Newcastle upon Tyne, to accept, on the basis of being more generally serviceable at Leeds. He was admitted an extra licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in June 1694.<br>
<br>While at Leeds Manlove published <span class="italic">Immortality of the Soul Asserted</span> (1697), with a commendatory preface by John Howe and Matthew Sylvester, in answer to Henry Layton's pamphlet published five years earlier. Layton issued a reply in 1703. The following year Manlove published his <span class="italic">Praeparatio evangelica</span> based on sermons preached at Leeds. Both works were much admired. William Tong believed that &#145;Mr Baxter will never be quite dead while Dr Manlove, who inherits so much his clear weighty way of writing, lives&#146;  (Hunter, ed., <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.356). His ministry, however, though able was not easy. Initially on friendly terms with Ralph Thoresby, the antiquary, who had played an active part in his choice, Manlove quarrelled with Thoresby's wish to continue hearing sermons by the local Anglican clergy. Manlove's censure encouraged Thoresby eventually to leave Mill Hill. Manlove was also in dispute over the size of his stipend. At Leeds his salary was &pound;60 a year and he was said to have earned as much again by practising physic. He was offered &pound;80 a year at Newcastle with less duty, and though strongly urged to stay at Leeds he refused, becoming in 1699 Gilpin's assistant in the place of William Pell who had died.<br>
<br>Manlove's stay at Newcastle was very brief. He caught a fever shortly after his arrival and died on 3 August 1699 at the age of thirty-five. In recording the event, Thoresby remarked, he &#145;enjoyed his quadruple salary but a little time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.330). Manlove was buried at the parish church of St Nicholas, Newcastle, on 6 August; his funeral sermon was preached and published by Gilpin, with a memoir by John Turnbull. The congregation showed such &#145;bounty and liberality&#146; to his widow &#145;as was never shewn upon any such occasion before (at least not in this place)&#146;  (J. Cay to Thoresby, 22 Aug 1699, Yorkshire Archaeological Society, MS 7). He was full of promise but often rash in his decisions&#151;Manlove's moves were considered by John Howe &#145;to have been twice too hasty&#146;  (J. Howe to J. Boyse, 3 Jan 1700, BL, Add. MS 4275, fol. 329). He was one of those younger ministers specially commended by Calamy for their learning, of whom neither Oxford nor Cambridge need &#145;have been asham'd&#146;  (Calamy, xxxi&#150;ii).<br>
