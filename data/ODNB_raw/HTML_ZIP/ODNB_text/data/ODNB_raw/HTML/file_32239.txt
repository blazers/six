<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Caird,  Edward</span>  (1835&#150;1908), <span class="occ">philosopher and college head</span>, was born on 23 March 1835 in Greenock. His father, John Caird (1787&#150;1838), the partner and manager of a firm of engineers in Greenock and a deeply religious man, died while Edward was still an infant. His mother, Janet (1799&#150;1889), the daughter of Roderick and Isabella Young of Paisley, raised her large family after her husband's early death, with the assistance of her extended family. Among Edward's brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4340/', "John Caird")</script>, theologian and principal of Glasgow University. Edward lived for much of his childhood with his aunt Jane Caird of Greenock. He was a delicate and retiring child; brought up by his aunt in religious and secluded surroundings, he displayed an interest in spiritual matters from an early age. He was first schooled at Greenock Academy, where he was taught by David Duff, later professor of church history at Edinburgh. Caird recalled: &#145;He was the first teacher that really awakened my mind&#146;  (Jones and Muirhead, 14).<br>
<br>Caird began studies at the University of Glasgow in the winter of 1850. He won prizes in Greek and Latin, ecclesiastical history, and divinity. At this time he also made several lasting friendships, most notably with John Nichol, later professor of English literature at Glasgow University. His university career, however, was punctuated by bouts of ill health. In the winter of 1856 he went to St Andrews with his aunt Jane to convalesce and to study divinity, and in the spring of 1857 he went to Perthshire to visit his brother John. He resumed studies in divinity at Glasgow later that year, although by this time he had decided not to enter the ministry and to pursue philosophical scholarship instead. He was already much influenced by the idealist bent of Carlyle and Goethe, for whom he developed a lifelong admiration.<br>
<br>Elected to a Snell exhibition in 1860, a scholarship which sent Scottish students to Oxford, Caird went up to Balliol College, where he found himself in the company of men such as Sir Courtney Ilbert&#151;who was to gain fame as the law member of the viceroy's council in India&#151;J. A. Symonds, and Thomas Case. But Caird at twenty-five was by this time rather older than many of the other students, and he tended to associate with the younger dons, notably the idealist philosopher T. H. Green. &#145;Caird and Green were kindred souls&#146;, observed J. L. Strachan-Davidson, a fellow student who later succeeded Caird as master of Balliol  (Jones and Muirhead, 28). Caird was elected to the Old Mortality Club, which promoted the study of reform, in the company of Green, A. V. Dicey, John Nichol, James Bryce, and others. He was awarded the Pusey and Ellerton scholarship in Hebrew in 1861 and the Jenkyns exhibition in 1862. He earned a first class in the final classical school in the next year and was elected a tutor at Merton College in 1864.<br>
<br>In May 1866 Caird was unanimously elected professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow against a field of strong candidates. He was initially reluctant to stand because his friend Nichol was also a candidate and, as he wrote to Jowett, &#145;I would rather have no professorship while the world standeth than do anything unkind to Nichol&#146;  (Jones and Muirhead, 48). But Nichol withdrew in his friend's favour and Caird was pleased to return to Scotland to take up the joint work of lecturing and scholarship for which he was so well suited. A year later, on 8 May 1867, he married Caroline Frances (Fanny) Wylie of Carluke, Lanarkshire.<br>
<br>After twenty-seven years at Glasgow, in 1893 Caird was unanimously elected master of Balliol College. He was reluctant to leave Glasgow: &#145;I may say that nothing would have made me do it, except what has happened&#151;a unanimous call to the College of Jowett and Green&#146;  (Bosanquet, 381). Upon his return to Balliol, he remarked to a friend: &#145;I shall have my hand on the heart of England&#146;  (Jones and Muirhead, 54). While he was less intimately connected to undergraduate life and more closely engaged in scholarship than his predecessor Benjamin Jowett, he was regarded as a very effective master. Like Jowett and T. H. Green, he regarded the task of the college as training students in the art of moral citizenship. As master, he continued to read and write philosophy: in this period he published <span class="italic">The Evolution of Religion</span> (1893) and, drawn by the emphasis in the Oxford curriculum on classical Greek philosophy to return to a study of Plato and Aristotle, he also published <span class="italic">The Evolution of Theology in the Greek Philosophers</span> (1904). But by 1907 his work was so hampered by a paralytic illness that he resigned the mastership of the college.<br>
<br>In the company of T. H. Green and F. H. Bradley, Caird led the revival of an idealist philosophy which became the most striking and powerful intellectual force in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Britain. His most significant contribution to this philosophical movement lay in his two works on Kant. In 1877 he published a critical account of the <span class="italic">Critique of Pure Reason</span>; this was followed in 1889 by a two-volume exposition of Kant's <span class="italic">Critique of Pure Reason</span>, <span class="italic">Critique of Practical Reason</span>, and <span class="italic">Critique of Judgement</span>. Caird's primary purpose was to demonstrate that, notwithstanding Kant's reputation for promoting dualism, the Kantian system was premised on a deep organic unity. Caird interpreted Kant freely, for he was convinced that Kant did not fully understand how consistently organic his own philosophical system actually was. Some critics regretted this radical reconstruction of Kant. But none the less, the volumes were widely regarded as authoritative, &#145;in many ways the culmination of the long English endeavour to assimilate Kant&#146;  (Pringle-Pattison, 278).<br>
<br>In 1883 Caird published a short study of Hegel: the first part was a biographical account, and the second a brief critical review of his philosophy. The comprehensive grasp of the development of philosophy in Germany which characterized his volumes on Kant was also demonstrated here. He paid special attention to Hegel's notion of a spiritual unity underlying superficial difference. He was also much interested in the resonance between Hegelian principles and Christianity. He read the Hegelian language of self-realization as essentially that of St Paul and St Augustine: the individual must relinquish an isolated life in order to live a spiritual or universal one. As a friend and contemporary philosopher, Bernard Bosanquet, commented: &#145;In Hegel &hellip; he found the nearest approach which any philosopher had made to the conception which he sought of a fully correlated concrete whole&#146;  (Bosanquet, 384). The highest expression of this unity he found in Christianity. For Caird, God was the absolute principle of unity.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Evolution of Religion</span>, initially delivered as the Gifford lectures at St Andrews between 1890 and 1892, is Caird's most explicitly constructive work. Here he sought to interpret Christianity along idealist principles and to weld together evolutionary ideas and theology by arguing that human history is an unfolding of a consciousness of the universal unity which underlies our experience. In a sense, Christianity was simply one of many expressions of this spiritual revelation; but Caird claimed a unique status for Christianity, more specifically for a thinking protestantism: it alone makes explicit in human consciousness the implicit idea of God or the Absolute. A modern and philosophical Christianity, Caird contended, also rightly admits the reality of evil but rather than lapsing into despair employs the idea of a timeless unity in which truth and good triumph over evil. While those of his contemporaries who leaned towards a materialist view of human experience were unconvinced, the book had a significant impact on others who had been searching for a rational account of spiritual experience, especially for those who, like Caird, were increasingly dissatisfied with the Calvinism in which they had been raised.<br>
<br>A contemporary of his regretted that Caird had devoted so much labour to the exposition of other philosophical systems, notably that of Kant, and suggested that he might have had a greater influence on his generation by working out an independent position. It is true that, with the exception of the work on religion, most of Caird's publications were interpretations of other philosophers. But like Green's these interpretative works indirectly formulated an alternative philosophical position. As Bosanquet explained, their critical interpretations were animated by the obligation to contest atomism and to demonstrate the underlying organic nature of human experience: &#145;we find in them throughout a peculiar lofty preoccupation or sense of spiritual duty&#146;, Bosanquet noted, which did not infuse the writings of even slightly younger idealists to the same extent  (Bosanquet, 382). This commitment to revealing an all-pervasive organicism was linked to a strong communitarian strand which ran through Caird's work, most strongly expressed in the lay sermons which he delivered as master at Balliol College. He constantly returned to the twin themes of social unity and individual independence, depicting the barrenness of a society which does not seek harmony between social and individual ends. He called on students to renounce selfishness and to pursue the common good. Philosophical study and social duty could not be separated.<br>
<br>For Caird social duty meant engagement in a variety of reform causes. As a student at Glasgow he became involved in campaigns for free education, the extension of the franchise, and the rights of women. He was at the forefront of the long and arduous campaign to admit women to university classes and degrees at Glasgow. He was one of four professors to begin lecturing to university extension classes of women in 1868; he repeatedly argued the cause of women's education before the university senate; and he served on the governing body of Queen Mary College, a women's college, before and after its formal incorporation into the University of Glasgow. He was also much involved with other aspects of university reform, for example ending the restriction of the teaching of theology to established church members. He played an important role in the Women's Protective and Provident League, which had been founded in 1888 to improve the working conditions of women and children and which later became the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades. Caird worked energetically to improve the industrial position of women; he advocated that the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span> include laundries. This invited one critic to complain that Caird was &#145;the principal teacher of what is called the new or sympathetic economy&#146;  (Jones and Muirhead, 118). Both Edward and Caroline Caird were instrumental in initiating the university settlement movement in Glasgow. Caird defended the philosophy of settlement: &#145;The general condition of the life of the poor could not be raised unless they were given the opportunities of social and intellectual progress and of contact with things that are beautiful&#146;  (Jones and Muirhead, 115). In keeping with this ideal, Edward and Caroline hosted evenings of entertainment, mainly music, once a fortnight at a house in the East End. Upon his return to Oxford as master of Balliol, Caird continued his support for university settlement by giving talks at Toynbee Hall. He also continued to crusade for extending university education to women: one of his first tasks as master was to open Balliol lectures to women students.<br>
<br>While aspects of contemporary socialism appealed strongly to him, Caird, like many of his contemporary idealists [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/98159', "British idealists")</script>], regarded class difference as a necessary and constructive feature of modern society, on the grounds that each class had an appropriate function and place in the social organism. He regretted, however, class antagonism which stood in the way of a sense of national unity. For Caird, the nation was &#145;the greatest ethical unity to which our services are immediately owing&#146;  (E. Caird, <span class="italic">Lay Sermons and Addresses</span>, 1907, 80). He was convinced that &#145;it is only that ideal of social service that can really purify our lives&#146;  (ibid., 118). But the patriotism which Caird himself felt and which he attempted to encourage in Balliol students was in no sense a shallow jingoism or antithetical to a wider internationalism. He was opposed to the South African War, and accordingly to the university's conferring of an honorary degree on Cecil Rhodes; he supported the movement towards international federation.<br>
<br>Caird was distinguished by a prominent forehead, imposing mutton-chop whiskers, penetrating dark eyes, and a tall frame. His contemporaries recalled his sympathetic, gentle, and modest nature, which concealed great strength of will and conviction. A colleague remembered that, while at a meeting of the philosophical society at Oxford, Caird, then master of Balliol, commented favourably on all the speakers, save one. On this speaker, he was silent. For Caird this silence expressed an outspoken and forceful disagreement. He told a friend after the meeting that he &#145;was glad to get that shot&#146; at the philosopher in question  (Jones and Muirhead, 69).<br>
<br>Caird was one of the foremost British philosophers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was also an important figure in the liberal theology movement. His influential study of Kant gave vitality to the discussion of the philosopher, and of German philosophy more generally, in Britain. For decades it remained the most important work on Kant in the English language. His students filled the chairs of philosophy in American, British, and colonial universities, continuing to expound variations of Caird's philosophical idealism, even as idealism began to be superseded by logical positivism. Caird's contribution to philosophy was recognized by the conferring of the honorary degrees of LLD by St Andrews in 1883 and by Glasgow in 1894, DCL by Oxford in 1891, and DLitt by Cambridge in 1898 and the University of Wales in 1902. Portraits of Caird hang in Balliol College and Glasgow; a tablet in Balliol College chapel and a bronze medallion at Glasgow further commemorate his legacy. He was an original member of the British Academy and a member of the French Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. Edward Caird died in the evening of 1 November 1908 at his home, 12 Bardwell Road, Oxford, and was buried in St Sepulchre's cemetery, Oxford, beside T. H. Green and Benjamin Jowett. He was survived by his wife.<br>
