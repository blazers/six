<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Elen,  Ernest Augustus <span class="st"> [Gus]</span></span>  (1862&#150;1940), <span class="occ">music-hall singer</span>, was born on 22 July 1862 at 103 Pulford Street, Pimlico, London, son of Edwin Elen, a viewer of cloth in a military store, and Mercy Elen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Letherbarrow. His early life in this relatively poor working-class district contained spells as a draper's assistant, an egg-packer, and a programme seller at the Royal Aquarium. He began his entertainment career singing in London public houses and in army canteens in Aldershot. He may also have been a street singer and worked as a supernumerary at the Opera Comique in 1882. By 1884 he had developed a black-face routine and performed with a minstrel troupe in Ramsgate, and as half of a double act in provincial halls. Following the death of his partner in 1885, he turned solo and began a steady ascent to the peak of the variety profession.<br>
<br>Although always essentially a comic singer, Elen did not initially adopt a distinctive style, with his advertising card claiming that &#145;Elen is alike at home in Comic, Eccentric or Dramatic ditties &hellip; no two characters the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 2 May 1891). However, in April 1891 he introduced a &#145;coster&#146; song, &#145;Never introduce your donah [sweetheart] to a pal&#146;, into his act. Coster singers, adopting the persona of the London costermonger or street fruit and vegetable vendor, had appeared on the halls from the 1860s but the huge success of Albert Chevalier's coster routine at the London Pavilion in February 1891 began a new vogue which Elen exploited. While he was to retain a mixed routine for some time, it was his coster material that made him one of music-hall's biggest stars in the 1890s and 1900s: when he was finally tempted to visit the United States in 1907, he reputedly commanded a salary of &pound;300 a week. Although most of his key songs and characterizations were produced in the 1890s he remained a popular turn until his retirement at the end of the First World War.<br>
<br>Elen's songs, performed in almost exact replica of costermonger or other London street costume, were delivered in a friendly if occasionally harsh voice and punctuated by a series of almost falsetto &#145;breaks&#146; which added both emphasis and comic effect. They were mainly rather wry and sardonic commentaries on the daily life of a distinct section of the London working class and, although Elen in his personal pronouncements was firmly wedded to values of self-discipline and thrift, they sometimes contained a gentle challenge to Victorian notions of respectability. &#145;'Arf a pint of ale&#146;, for example, in which the &#145;'arf&#146; eventually became &#145;a barrel and an 'arf&#146;, celebrated the pleasures of beer, while &#145;Wait until the work comes round&#146; and &#145;'E talks just like a picture book&#146; hymned the joys of idleness. These mildly satirical tendencies and his avoidance of the excessive sentimentality often associated with late Victorian and Edwardian popular song (along with the size and relative availability of his recorded output) made him a particular favourite of latter-day music-hall historians and cultural commentators. In particular, he has often been compared favourably with his middle-class rival Albert Chevalier, deemed to have presented a rather generalized and less &#145;authentic&#146; portrayal of London life.<br>
<br>Elen originally wrote some of his own material but from the early 1890s he relied largely upon professional writers, albeit cutting their songs &#145;about a good deal before producing them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 23 Sept 1905). He was especially well served by lyricists Edgar Bateman, usually partnered by melodist George Le Brunn, and Harry Wright, who worked with Fred Eplett. Bateman provided the words for Elen's two best known songs, &#145;It's a great big shame&#146; (1896), which charted the problems of a newly-wed friend of &#145;six foot free&#146; nagged by a wife of &#145;four foot two&#146;, and &#145;If it wasn't for the 'ouses in between&#146; (1894). This classic music-hall song dealt with a cockney's knowing pretence about the view from his back garden and featured such lines as:<blockquote>
<div>if yer eyesight didn't fail yer,<br>
</div>
<div>yer could see right to Australia,<br>
</div>
<div>if it wasn't for the 'ouses in between.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>As these song quotations and such song titles as &#145;It's a marvel 'ow 'e does it but he do&#146; suggest, Elen made good if sometimes stylized use of London's demotic speech and idiom. Interestingly, he was extremely popular outside of the capital and &#145;Never introduce your donah&#146;, although first performed in London, appears to have become a major success during the course of a lengthy provincial tour in the autumn of 1891. Through his depiction of a distinct, local character, Elen both played a role in reinforcing provincial images of the Londoner and in creating a space for explorations of local and regional characterization which Scottish and northern singers were later able to exploit.<br>
<br>From 1898 Elen lived largely in Balham, where he bred poultry and took up photography. He also became a keen fisherman, particularly during a spell in residence on the south coast, and enjoyed shooting. He was married, but nothing is known about his wife beyond the fact that she helped him with his extensive charitable activities. As a result of the nostalgia for music-hall's &#145;golden days&#146; which was a notable feature of the 1930s, Elen made a brief comeback in 1931 and then appeared at the 1935 royal variety performance in a &#145;Cavalcade of Variety&#146;. He had recorded songs as early as 1899, but he rerecorded much of his material in 1931 and 1932. After a short, final retirement, he died of liver cancer at his home, Edith Villa, 3 Thurleigh Avenue, Balham, on 17 February 1940.<br>
