<span class="headword">Maunche,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1465), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was Venetian by birth, but had settled in London by 1439, when he imported a cargo of madder, currants, and linen cloth worth just over &pound;35 on the <i>Jacob</i> captained by William Johnson. However, trading on his own account does not seem to have been the main purpose of his presence in the capital. From April 1440, together with his fellow Venetians, James Trott and Lorenzo Marconovo, he was regularly assigned to the supervision of the English mercer and royal wardrobe supplier Thomas Chalton. Chalton's summaries of their trade show that the trio worked as factors for Lorenzo's relative Giovanni Marconovo, who had been resident in London during the 1420s and 1430s, and&#151;along with Trott&#151;had been named among the grocers' livery in the 1430s.<br>
<br>In this capacity Maunche and his associates offloaded goods from the Venetian galleys which stopped at London, as well as handling goods coming into the capital from Sandwich and Southampton. Their business consisted partly of grocery&#151;luxury spices such as currants, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, mace, green ginger, and cinnamon, which would yield very high profits&#151;and partly of useful chemicals for the English cloth industry&#151;dyestuffs such as brasil, saffron, madder, and woad, and the mordant alum. They also sold raw silk and small quantities of gold and silver thread to London silkwomen, including the royal wardrobe supplier Isabel Norman. They dabbled in luxury fabrics, such as the gold baldachins worth nearly &pound;110 which they sold to the earl of Gloucester in March 1442. Although they bought piece tin from Londoners like Philip Malpas and Nicholas Yeo, their particular export interest was cloth, and in this respect Maunche's freedom of the Drapers' Company proved useful to their enterprise. Indeed, he and his associates were valuable clients for the London drapers. In October and November 1440, they spent just over &pound;770 on purchases of &#145;Western&#146; cloths from Simon Eyre alone, and in June 1442 they bought &#145;Ludlow&#146; cloths worth &pound;560 from John Gedeney. Their occasional forays outside London to buy wool were also lucrative for provincial English merchants, with whom they spent over &pound;2000 in February 1443; again, this could work in favour of an individual such as Margery Page, who had sold Cotswolds wool worth almost &pound;430 to Maunche and his colleagues in March 1442.<br>
<br>On 26 November 1443 Maunche was granted letters of denization, which cost him 10 marks, and he was admitted to the freedom of the city a few months later, on 8 February 1444. His freedom came at exactly double the price of naturalization. At first he continued at his usual residence in Langbourn ward, where he had lived since at least 1441, but he moved to the more prestigious Broad Street and Bishopsgate area by September 1449, where he was still recorded as a Venetian by the English authorities despite his changed nationality. He stayed there until at least 1451. His name featured in four suits in the mayor's court during 1444&#150;6, two of them involving the debts of Francesco de San Cassiano, for whom Maunche may also have worked as a factor. He traded in his own name on the Venetian galleys in 1445, importing ginger and silk worth almost &pound;130; and in 1450 he imported in his own name again, this time a small cargo including sweet wine, madder, miniver, and linen thread, with a total value of &pound;32, but the record for his independent business activities indicates a much more limited range and capital than that to which he was accustomed as an employee.<br>
<br>Together with Lorenzo Marconovo, Maunche was among the witnesses to the Venetian Antonio Zane's will in 1440, and in 1450 he acted as administrator on the death of his long-standing colleague James Trott. Maunche died at some time between February and November 1465, describing himself in his will as a citizen and draper. He was to be buried under a marble slab at the Austin Friars&#151;the most popular place of interment for fifteenth-century Italians in London&#151;and left a &pound;2 fee to the friars. His parish church was St Margaret, Lothbury, nearby, to which he left &pound;1 for maintenance of the building and 2<i>s</i>. for the high altar. The entire residue of his estate was bequeathed to his widow and principal executor, Margaret, &#145;therwith to do and dispose her owne free wille&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/5/11). Margaret afterwards married the draper Thomas Asby, and both were pardoned any debts due to the crown from her late husband within a year of his death, in respect of accounts for his office as aulnager (inspector of cloths) in Wiltshire.<br>
