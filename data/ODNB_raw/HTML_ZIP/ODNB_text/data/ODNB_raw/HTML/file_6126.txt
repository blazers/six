<span class="headword">Cony,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1707), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was one of four children of unknown parentage, possibly born in Sutton, Oxfordshire. He was appointed second lieutenant of the <i>Torbay</i> on 3 October 1696 and transferred twenty-three days later to the <i>Humber</i>. In May 1699 he was appointed third lieutenant of the <i>Kent</i> and moved in March 1701 to the <i>Boyne</i>. In September, still a third lieutenant, he was appointed to the <i>Sorlings</i> (32 guns). Four months later, having been promoted to first lieutenant, he moved to the <i>Boyne</i> before moving to the <i>Chichester</i> in March 1702. He was appointed commander of the <i>Maidstone</i> in January 1703 and in April 1704 was appointed captain of the <i>Sorlings</i>.<br>
<br>Cony was married to Catherine Pleydell (<i>d</i>. 1715) by the time he made out his will while at sea on 13 June 1704. He bequeathed gold mourning rings &#145;of a Guinea value&#146; to his brother-in-law Edmund Pleydell and other members of the Pleydell family. He gave a shilling to his brother Edward and 50 guineas to his sister Elizabeth, and appointed his wife his sole executor.<br>
<br>In October 1705 Cony was sent to the Baltic with the <i>Pendennis</i> (50 guns) and the <i>Blackwall</i>. On 20 October the three ships escorted a homeward-bound Baltic convoy and met four French men-of-war and five merchant ships commanded by the Chevalier St-Pol. In the ensuing battle, St-Pol and two of the English captains died and Cony twice repelled boarders. He was badly wounded but declared later that &#145;I struck not the Queen's colours but defended the ship to the last moment, and was taken sword in hand being overpowered by numbers&#146;. After Cony was captured he suffered &#145;barbarous usage &hellip; I was stripped naked and left cold with my wounds bleeding&#146; until a French officer arrived  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5266, Cony to [Josiah Burchett], Dunkirk, 20 Nov [1705]). Learning that Cony was the captain the Frenchman expressed concern at this treatment and had his wounds dressed&#151;&#145;My being alive I look on as a wonderful Providence&#146;  (ibid.). Cony was imprisoned at Dunkirk, where he was well treated by the governor until his release. In his absence a court martial held on 29 January 1706 investigated the capture of the <i>Sorlings</i> and resolved that Cony &#145;did particularly distinguish himself &hellip; and having been several times boarded and repulsing the enemy and received several dangerous wounds&#146; and recommended him to &#145;his Royal Highnesses Favour&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5266, CM 29 Jan 1706).<br>
<br>As a result Cony was appointed to the <i>Romney</i> (52 guns) and joined Sir Cloudesley Shovell in the Mediterranean before taking part in the reduction of Ostend. In December 1706 Cony, cruising with the <i>Milford</i> and the <i>Fowey</i>, learned about a French ship, which they sighted on 17 December in Malaga Bay. The French privateer of sixteen guns, which had bronze cannon from the French flagship <i>Magnamine</i> on board, lay close to the mole under the town's cannon, but Cony &#145;resolved to go in with his own ship and fetch her off&#146;. He sailed in &#145;under French colours&#146; and anchored &#145;within pistol shot&#146; next to the Frenchman, who sent a boat to greet him. Cony captured the crew, &#145;put out the English colours and fired a whole broadside into the ship&#146;, and continued to fire until he &#145;drove the men out of her&#146;. Then he sent his boat, cut the privateer's cables, and sailed out of the bay with his prize, &#145;notwithstanding a very warm fire from all the works of Malaga upon him&#146;, without losing a man (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 4298; TNA: PRO, ADM 51/4261/7, <i>Milford</i>).<br>
<br>On 3 January 1707 Cony burnt the fifty-gun French ship <i>Content</i>. Two days later he challenged another ship. After it ignored him for the third time, he declared: &#145;I am The Queen of England's Man of War. If he were a Algereene he should bring to under my stern else I would fire at him&#146;. Cony fired a gun at the ship:<blockquote>which in an instance was returned with a general fire of small arms and then a broadside. I was ready for him and I thought myself obliged to defend Her Majesty's Honour and my own Reputation and not to suffer Her Majesty's Colours to be affronted with powder and ball.</blockquote>The chase eventually put out Algerine colours, but as the two ships were very near the shore and the Algerine &#145;got so close in among the rocks&#146; Cony stood off  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/1593, Cony to [Josiah Burchett], 27 March 1707). On 8 January Cony and the other ships burnt the forty-gun French privateer <i>La Mercur&eacute;</i>.<br>
<br>Cony wrote to Burchett from Lisbon in March 1707:<blockquote>I Return His Royal Highness Thanks for the Honour he is pleased to do me in taking notice of the great success I have had in my cruise. I beg you to assure his Royal Highness that I will endeavour to do everything in my power to preserve his opinion of me. (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/1593, Cony to [Josiah Burchett], 27 March 1707)</blockquote>Cony took part in Shovell's attack on Toulon and was in Sir Thomas Dilkes's flagship at the bombardment of Toulon. He returned to England with Shovell and died on 22 October 1707 when the <i>Romney</i>, inshore of Shovell's flagship, ran on the rocks in the Isles of Scilly and was lost with all hands.<br>
