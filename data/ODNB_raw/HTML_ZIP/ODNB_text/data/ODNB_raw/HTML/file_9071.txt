<span class="headword">Fairclough,  Richard</span>  (1621?&#150;1682), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9072/', "Samuel Fairclough (1594&#150;1677)")</script>, lecturer at Clare, Suffolk, and his first wife, Susan Blackerby (<i>d</i>. 1638); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9073/', "Samuel Fairclough (1625&#150;1691)")</script> was his younger brother. Admitted in 1637 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he graduated BA in 1641 and proceeded MA and became a fellow in 1644. The year before he had accompanied Benjamin Whichcote, another Emmanuel fellow, to Somerset when the latter was presented to the college living of North Cadbury, and he remained to serve the parish after his friend's recall to Cambridge. About this time, at the request of Sir John Horner, the presbyterian sheriff of Somerset, Fairclough preached an assize sermon which so impressed Horner that he offered the young minister the living of Mells. On 24 September 1647 Fairclough was admitted to the rectory, where he quickly established his reputation as a diligent, loving pastor. Besides Sunday sermons, he regularly preached five weekday lectures. He found time not only to visit the sick, &#145;but also &hellip; all the families within his charge&#146;, striving &#145;to understand the present state of their souls&#146;. His &#145;almost incredible&#146; labours reportedly transformed &#145;an obscure country village&#146; into a &#145;most noted place&#146;, and his parishioners into a &#145;much enlightened &hellip; seriously religious people&#146;  (Howe, 52, 51). But Mells was no dark corner before Fairclough's arrival. The cloth towns of north-eastern Somerset had emerged during the previous generation as hotbeds of popular puritanism; indeed, at Mells parish &eacute;lites had vigorously resisted the ceremonial innovations of their Laudian rector, Henry Ancketyll. Fairclough signalled his commitment to presbyterian discipline in 1648 by endorsing the Somerset <span class="italic">Attestation</span>, and was named an assistant to the county's commission of ejectors in 1654. He also took an active role in Somerset's voluntary clerical association. Despite his partisan sympathies he attempted to steer a moderate course and aligned himself with the most conciliatory godly clergy&#151;men such as William Thomas of Ubley, John Chetwind of Wells, and John Humfrey of nearby Frome.<br>
<br>Unable to accept the terms imposed by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, Fairclough was ejected in August 1662. Along with his father, brother Samuel, and two brothers-in-law, Richard Shute and George Jones, who had all lost their livings at the Restoration, he retired to his sister's house in Finchingfield, Essex. This &#145;little Colledge of Divines&#146; lived together for several years before Richard left for London  (Clark, 175). In May 1672 he took out a licence as a presbyterian teacher in Thames Street, and he later served a congregation in Newman Street. Although he had returned west to Bristol by April 1681, he continued to visit his London flock once a fortnight. Like his father Fairclough allegedly refused payment for his preaching after 1662. Along with his own extensive charity, this ultimately left him dependent upon the financial assistance of unnamed London benefactors.<br>
<br>Fairclough's fame certainly does not rest on his published works. To the collection <span class="italic">Suffolk's Tears</span> (1653), edited by his brother Samuel, he contributed an elegy on the death of his father's patron, Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston. His anonymous <span class="italic">Pastor's Legacy</span> (1663) is an abridgement, based on the notes of one of the congregation, of fourteen farewell sermons preached at Mells. An exhortation to practical piety, it is a far cry from his ponderously learned sermon in defence of the doctrine of assurance, published in the <span class="italic">Morning-Exercise Against Popery</span> (1675). He also wrote several passages in the popular <span class="italic">Life and Death of &hellip; Joseph Alleine</span> (1672) and, with John Chetwind, edited William Thomas's posthumous <span class="italic">Scriptures Opened</span> (1675).<br>
<br>Fairclough was married to a &#145;most pious, prudent matron&#146;, of whom nothing more is known  (Howe, 57). She must have died before he made his will in April 1681. The couple had no surviving children. Fairclough died in London on 4 July 1682, probably aged sixty-one, and was buried six days later in Bunhill Fields. Some 500 people, including such prominent conformists as John Tillotson and Edward Stillingfleet, attended his funeral. As this suggests, Fairclough's moderation was celebrated: &#145;In the substantials of religion, no man was more fervently zealous; about the circumstantials, none more cool and temperate&#146;  (ibid., 56).<br>
