<span class="headword">Popham, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1395&#150;1463), <span class="occ">military commander and diplomat</span>, was the son of Sir John Popham (<i>d</i>. 1418), a younger son of the Hampshire family of Popham, which lies between Basingstoke and Winchester. His mother was Matilda, probably the daughter of Oliver Zouche of South Charford, Hampshire, and Eynesbury, Huntingdonshire. Both his father and his uncle, Henry Popham, sat in various parliaments as knights of the shire for Hampshire and held the shrievalty. Sir John senior was also constable of Southampton Castle from 1404 to his death in 1418. Sir John junior may have been educated at Bishop Wykeham's College of St Mary at Winchester.<br>
<br>Both Popham and his cousin Stephen served as men-at-arms in the retinue of Edward, duke of York, on the campaign of 1415. In York's will he was bequeathed some armour, a helmet, and a horse, and also received the grant of a life rent from the deceased duke's manor of Vastern in Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, an annuity subsequently confirmed by Richard, duke of York. It is likely that he was knighted before or after Agincourt: he later claimed that the royal annuity of 100 marks granted on 12 February 1417 was in recognition of his services at the battle. He indented to serve again on 23 February 1417 and crossed to Harfleur in March; he then joined the king in his conquest of Lower Normandy. He was appointed <i>bailli</i> of Caen in December 1417 and captain of Bayeux in January 1421, and granted houses in those towns, as well as the lordships of Torigni-sur-Vire and Planquery, and, in October 1418, the governorship of Southampton Castle in succession to his father, which he held until 1441. Shortly after Henry V's death his appointments at Bayeux and Caen were terminated. Thenceforward he was closely associated with the regent, John, duke of Bedford. He was variously described as chancellor of France or of Normandy between September 1422 and January 1424, and later as Bedford's chancellor, his lieutenant at Rouen (January&#150;November 1429) and chamberlain (from April 1429). He brought reinforcements from England in the summer of 1425, was captain of St Suzanne (Maine) from 1425 to 1435, and served at the sieges of Pontorson and Orl&eacute;ans. He was closely involved with arranging the defence of Paris following French successes under Jeanne d'Arc in 1429. He probably returned to England in November 1429 but crossed again in the summer of 1430 with the coronation expedition.<br>
<br>There is a puzzling gap in Popham's career for the next four years: he is next found present at a great council held at Westminster from 24 April to 8 May 1434 at which Bedford and Gloucester quarrelled over the conduct of the war. In the next seven years he went to France on six further occasions: to the Congress of Arras in July 1435 and the <i>grand conseil</i> at Rouen that October; as councillor to Richard, duke of York, in May 1436, having negotiated special terms with the council and become a knight-banneret; to inspect the Norman garrisons and negotiate with the French and Bretons in the spring and summer of 1438; as a member of the peace embassy in 1439; and, following further concessions from the crown, as councillor to York between November 1441 and February 1442.<br>
<br>In England, Popham was treasurer of the household from 17 April 1437 until April 1439 and was elected MP for Hampshire in November 1439. From 1442 he served on local commissions in Hampshire. Although Popham was nominated to the Order of the Garter by the duke of Buckingham and Lord Sudeley at the chapter of April 1447, Alfonso of Portugal was appointed instead. He was again elected MP for Hampshire for the parliament which met at Westminster on 6 November 1449. It was probably his extensive military and diplomatic experience rather than his links with the house of York which led to his nomination as speaker. He declined the office on the grounds of ill health, but he may have been all too well aware of the parlous situation in Normandy and of growing political disquiet at home. Although he served on a few more local commissions, he was not in close touch with politics or government after 1449. On 1 July 1460 he was admitted to the confraternity of the London Charterhouse. He died on 14 April 1463, and was buried in the Charterhouse in one of the two chapels he had endowed in 1453.<br>
<br>Popham never married. At his death the main Popham estates, which had passed to him at the death of his cousin, Sir Stephen, in 1444, reverted to the latter's four daughters. The estates which he had inherited from his mother's family along with his own extensive purchases passed, by the terms of a settlement made in 1459, mainly to Alice, probably a kinswoman on his mother's side, daughter of John Malyns and wife of William Hertshorn (MP for Bedfordshire in 1449), with the reversion to her daughter, Elizabeth, wife of Charles Bulkeley.<br>
