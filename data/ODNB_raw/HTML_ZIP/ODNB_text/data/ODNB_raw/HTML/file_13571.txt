<span class="headword">Hollond <span class="st"> [Holland]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1624&#150;<em>c.</em>1661), <span class="occ">naval official</span>, was from an obscure background, but may have originally come from London or the surrounding areas. He first entered the navy about 1624 in the humble capacity of a clerk at Chatham. In 1626 and again in 1627 he was recommended, unsuccessfully, for a purser's place and also failed to obtain the position of clerk of the check at Portsmouth, which would have amounted to a significant promotion. The position went to his long-term rival, John Brooke, much to Hollond's annoyance. Hollond was argumentative but undoubtedly competent and by 1635 had risen to become paymaster of the navy, probably through the patronage of Kenrick Edisbury, surveyor of the navy. In this position he was directly responsible to the navy treasurer and wielded considerable influence, which he used to secure the dismissal and short-term imprisonment of Brooke for malpractice.<br>
<br>In 1636 the earl of Northumberland, the admiral of the ship money fleet, presented a document to Charles I containing thirteen articles outlining current abuses in the navy. Hollond was implicated for his refusal to pay the wages of men transferred from one ship to another unless they could produce tickets as proof of service. These tickets often proved impossible to obtain, and many seamen were defrauded of legitimate wages. He had also allegedly accepted gratuities for payment on such tickets. He was, however, found guilty only of the offence of charging 2<i>s</i>. in the pound for the practice of stopping slops money (for clothing) out of the seamen's wages, his defence being that this had been common practice for the previous thirty years. He was ordered to stop the practice and it appears that no further action was taken.<br>
<br>In his manuscript entitled &#145;A discourse of the navy&#146; of 1638 (published in 1896) Hollond examined in detail, and in a rough style, the navy's endemic material abuses, inefficiencies, and corruption. The emphasis of the &#145;Discourse&#146; was on the administration of wages, victuals, stores, and personnel. There is no definite reference to Hollond between the publication of the &#145;Discourse&#146; and the defection of the fleet to parliament in 1642, but he was an active partner in the timber trade and was probably the same John Hollond who sold timber to the navy in 1639. In 1642 he became one of parliament's six professional navy commissioners, at a salary of &pound;100 p.a. He was particularly active as a commissioner in this early period of hostilities when administration at the senior level was being radically reorganized, but his abrasiveness soon brought him into conflict with the other commissioners.<br>
<br>In February 1644 Hollond was nominated as a commissioner for the sale of prize goods, another potentially lucrative position, but this was balanced by the loss of his place as a navy commissioner in late 1645. He was said to have absented himself from this post for fourteen months in 1644&#150;5, while he, in turn, alleged that differences with colleagues obliged him to stay away from his duties, and it seems impossible to establish the truth of the matter. One of the main causes of friction was the hire (or freight) by parliament of vessels for service in the navy, owned or part owned by members of the navy's administration. The freight rate established after the outbreak of hostilities of &pound;3 15<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per man per month (allowing thirty men per hundred tons) was more complicated than the previous arrangement of a set amount per ton, and was particularly susceptible to exploitation. A significant number of vessels owned by naval administrators and officers (up to and including the earl of Warwick, lord admiral) received freight and it was to become a focus of Hollond's criticism of the navy commissioners. He named Giles Green, chairman of the navy committee, as the chief culprit in this abuse, though navy commissioners such as Samuel Vassall, Richard Crandley, and Alexander Bence also owned shares in vessels hired by the state. The sums involved can best be judged by the freight record of the <span class="italic">Mayflower</span>, the owners of which (including Vassall) received &pound;22,947 19<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. over a three-year period. While it was only natural that those with a maritime background should form the nucleus of the navy commissioners it would also appear that they used their positions to unfair advantage. Hollond's replacement, Thomas Smith, was yet another shipowner whose vessels received freight.<br>
<br>Although this marked a temporary end to Hollond's administrative career he returned to naval affairs following the execution of the king and the reorganization of naval administration. In January 1649 he was appointed to the committee of merchants established to remodel the navy and the customs, and in February as navy surveyor in place of Sir William Batten, and again as a commissioner. He resigned in December 1652 following charges against him by his colleagues, which he vigorously denied, and in the wake of a clash with the powerful Pett clan. He later denounced the committee of merchants, asserting that the &#145;welfare of the English navy was of no more concern to them than was the navy of the great Turk, unless it were to settle a brother and a friend in two or three of the best places thereof&#146;  (Capp, 50), though his criticisms cannot be taken at face value. Following his departure from office he moved from his official residence at Tower Hill to Deptford and resumed his timber trade.<br>
<br>Hollond did not completely disappear from public life for in August 1654 he was appointed one of the commissioners to resolve problems in the allocation of land among the adventurers for Ireland. He appears to have invested in the adventure himself on such a scale as to secure an allocation of 2666 acres in King's county. Alongside these duties he maintained his interest in the timber trade and was engaged in the preparation of his second &#145;Discourse&#146;. Although written largely before 1658 it finally appeared with a dedication to the duke of York (perhaps with an eye to future employment), which dates it to about 1661. (Again, it remained unpublished until 1896.) The second &#145;Discourse&#146; attracted some attention. Longer, more polished, and more systematic than the first, it covered a range of new topics, particularly with regard to victualling. It was highly regarded by Pepys, who used it as a source for his ideas on naval administration, and by Sir William Penn. In November 1660 Hollond's proposals to allow for the immediate discharge of the Commonwealth fleet, hampered by lack of ready money, were considered by the Admiralty but not implemented. He appears to have died shortly afterwards, though his widow may have survived until 1692, residing at Deptford where two of Hollond's daughters are recorded as having died, Mabel in 1666 and Mary in 1670.<br>
<br>Hollond had sought to pursue his dual callings as state servant and businessman without overt political commitments, and avoiding conflicts of interest. In the second &#145;Discourse&#146; he stood upon his professional integrity, noting that he had avoided supplying timber to the navy while acting as a commissioner. Instead he denounced profiteering through contracts for victuals and ships and, though some comments in the second &#145;Discourse&#146; targeted the &#145;godly&#146;, thus playing to a Restoration audience, the focus of Hollond's criticisms remained the structures which bred corruption within the administration of the navy.<br>
