<span class="headword">Weld,  Isaac</span>  (1774&#150;1856), <span class="occ">topographical writer</span>, born in Fleet Street, Dublin, on 15 March 1774, was the eldest son of Isaac Weld (<i>d</i>. 1824) and his first wife, Elizabeth Kerr, and the half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28982/', "Charles Richard Weld")</script>. His great-great-grandfather, the Revd Edmund Weld (<i>c</i>.1631&#150;1668), chaplain of Blarney Castle, co. Cork, was the descendant of Sir Richard Weld of Eaton. His grandfather was named Isaac after Newton, the friend of his great-grandfather, Dr Nathaniel Weld (1660&#150;1730). Both Nathaniel and his son Isaac (1710&#150;1778) were nonconformist ministers at New Row, Dublin. Isaac's edition of John Leland's <span class="italic">Discourses</span> (4 vols., 1769) has an autobiographical preface.<br>
<br>Young Isaac, the third of the name, was sent to the school of Samuel Whyte at 75 Grafton Street, Dublin, and thence to that of Rochemont Barbauld at Palgrave, near Diss, Norfolk. From Diss he went to Norwich as a private pupil of Dr William Enfield, a well-known dissenting minister; he left Norwich in 1793. He gained the degree BA from Trinity College, Dublin. In 1795, having decided to explore the United States and Canada, he set sail from Dublin for Philadelphia. He spent a little over two years in America. Often guided by Indians, he explored the vast forests and great rivers. While in the towns he mixed in the best society, and he met George Washington. He returned home at the close of 1797 &#145;without entertaining the slightest wish to revisit [North America]&#146;, and published in 1799 his <span class="italic">Travels through &hellip; North America and &hellip; Canada</span>. The work was well received and it went to several English editions and was translated into French, German, and Dutch. It was, however, described as &#145;a silly book by one Weld&#146;, one of a number of European &#145;birds of passage&#146; whose books had done &#145;much mischief&#146; and whose enquiries often bothered George Washington  (letter of Richard Peters, American patriot and jurist, to James Madison). None the less, his descriptions were influential because they were relatively early and were long included in compilations of travellers' reports on the United States in this period, despite his general lack of sympathy with the American patriots. Weld was introduced at the Institut at Paris as an American traveller, and was elected a member of the Historical and Literary Society of Quebec, and, on 27 November 1800, of the Royal Dublin Society, of which he in 1849 became vice-president.<br>
<br>In 1801, at the request of the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Hardwicke, Weld drew up a paper based on data in his book, in the hope of diverting Irish emigrants away from the United States to Canada. Lord Hardwicke in return procured for him a post in the Irish customs, which had been held by Weld's father, but which brought Weld himself very little money. He married at Edinburgh, in 1802, Alexandrina Home; they had no children.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Weld published <span class="italic">Illustrations of &hellip; Killarney</span> (1807 and 1812), which, like his American work, he illustrated himself, and which included a description of his journeys made in a boat which he manufactured out of compressed brown paper. His taste for unusual craft continued when, in May 1815, he sailed in the pioneer 14 horsepower steamboat <i>Thames</i>, from D&uacute;n Laoghaire to London, a voyage which he described in an appendix to George Dodd's <span class="italic">Dissertation on Steam Engines</span> (1818). In 1838 he drew up for the Royal Dublin Society a <span class="italic">Statistical Survey &hellip; of Roscommon</span>. He took a keen interest in Irish industries, and suggested the triennial exhibitions which the Royal Dublin Society later inaugurated.<br>
<br>In his later years Weld travelled extensively in Italy and spent much time in Rome, where he became a close friend of Canova. He died on 4 August 1856 at Ravenswell, near Bray, where most of his later life (when he was not travelling) had been spent. The Royal Dublin Society raised a monument to his memory in Mount Jerome cemetery in 1857. He apparently regretted the ill humour and anti-American tone of his first book  (letter of Joseph Dulles cited in Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>) but it is none the less the work for which he is best remembered.<br>
