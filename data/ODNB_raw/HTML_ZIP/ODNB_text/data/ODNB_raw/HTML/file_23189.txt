<span class="headword">Rawlinson, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1806&#150;1888), <span class="occ">judge in India</span>, was born at Combe, Hampshire, on 10 July 1806, the second son of John Rawlinson (1777/8&#150;1847), of the Middle Temple and Combe and Alresford, Hampshire, police magistrate at Marylebone, Middlesex, and his wife, Felicia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. He was educated at Charterhouse School, London (January 1819 to December 1823) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1824, BA 1828, MA 1831). Admitted at the Middle Temple on 28 March 1828 and called to the bar on 25 November 1831, he joined the western circuit in 1832, and was recorder of Portsmouth from 1840 to 1847. On 27 May 1847 he married Georgina Maria, younger daughter of Alexander Radclyffe Sidebottom, barrister; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Rawlinson was recorder of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore, and Malacca from March 1847 to April 1850. On 24 February 1847 he was knighted. From April 1850 he was chief justice of the supreme court of judicature at Madras until he retired in 1859. In his charge to the grand jury on 5 January 1859 he expressed his belief that great benefits would accrue from the recent transfer of the government of India from the East India Company to the crown, and denied the assertion then commonly made by British officials in India, that no materials for self-government existed there. On 9 February 1859 he was presented with a farewell address by the Indian community of Madras at an entertainment at which the governor, Lord Harris, was present.<br>
<br>Rawlinson published <span class="italic">The Municipal Corporation Act 5 &amp; 6 Will. IV c. 76</span> (1842 and later editions). He died at his home, 33 Eaton Square, London, on 28 March 1888.<br>
<br>Rawlinson's eldest son, Christopher Rawlinson (1850&#150;1916), was born in London on 13 March 1850, educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1871, MA 1874), admitted at the Inner Temple on 9 April 1870, and called to the bar on 26 January 1874. He was on the western circuit, became a revising barrister in 1883, and died on 2 September 1916. The second son, Albemarle Alexander Rawlinson (1853&#150;1930), was born in Madras on 27 September 1853 and educated at Winchester. He was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1872, but left for the 18th hussars (sub-lieutenant 1874, major 1883) and served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. He died on 25 September 1930 at Shiplake, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>The youngest son, John Frederick Peel Rawlinson (1860&#150;1926), was born at Airsford on 21 December 1860 and educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (LLB 1883, LLM 1887, honorary LLD 1920). He was an association football blue and played for England in 1882. He was admitted at the Inner Temple on 18 June 1881 and called to the bar on 25 June 1884; he was appointed QC in 1897, bencher in 1907. He represented the Treasury in the inquiry after the Jameson raid. He was recorder of Cambridge from 1906 to 1926, and Conservative MP for Cambridge University from 1906 until his death, unmarried, on 14 January 1926.<br>
