<span class="headword">Greenwood, Sir  Granville George</span>  (1850&#150;1928), <span class="occ">politician and animal welfare reformer</span>, was born in London on 3 January 1850, the second son of John Greenwood QC (1800&#150;1871) of the western circuit (solicitor to the Treasury, 1866&#150;71) and his wife, Fanny H. Welch, daughter of William Collyns of Starcross, Devon. He was educated at Eton College (1862&#150;9) and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1869, was a foundation scholar 1871, and gained a first class in classics in 1873. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1872, called to the bar in 1876, and joined the western circuit. He was assistant commissioner for charities (1884). On 11 April 1878 he married Laurentia Trent, daughter of Laurence Trent Cumberbatch MD of 25 Cadogan Place, London; they had one son and three daughters; his wife survived him. He was an original member of the Eighty Club and, from 1879, of the United University Club. He unsuccessfully contested Peterborough for the Liberals in 1886 and Central Hull in 1900. With the financial and political support of Herbert Gladstone he was elected Liberal MP for Peterborough in 1906, and sat until defeated in 1918. He was knighted in 1916.<br>
<br>As a Liberal MP, Greenwood advocated reforms concerning land, education, the House of Lords, poor and labour laws, pensions, death certification, women's suffrage, national health insurance, proportional representation, handling of police complaints, rights of colonial natives, and, between 1914 and 1918, the condition of British troops abroad and the quality of the army's medical services. He was critical of capital punishment and strongly opposed the flogging of schoolchildren and colonial natives. His main concern, however, was the protection of animals, especially as regards vivisection, abattoirs, zoos, live exports, the treatment of horses, the sale of deer, field sports, the transport of poultry, plumage imports, and the condition of pit ponies. He was a council member of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals from 1908 to 1927. His greatest achievement politically was to steer through parliament the <span class="roman">Protection of Animals Act</span> (1911), where his polite, businesslike, and practical approach proved successful. This consolidating act remained the basic law protecting animals from cruelty throughout the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Greenwood's main literary interest was in Shakespeare, on whose works he was considered expert. From his <span class="italic">The Shakespeare Problem Restated</span> (1908) to <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Handwriting and the Northumberland Manuscript</span> and <span class="italic">The Stratford Bust and the Droeshout Engraving</span> (both 1925) Greenwood published about a dozen pieces arguing that William Shakespere (<i>sic</i>) of Stratford was not the author of Shakespeare's works. Not a Baconian but an agnostic, Greenwood made negative attacks on Shakespearian orthodoxy with &#145;a curious mixture of suavity and abuse&#146;  (Schoenbaum, 427), and argued the plays were the work of a talented lawyer. The <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and others have rated his contribution to this long controversy as &#145;scholarly&#146; and &#145;rational&#146;. His other writings included attacks on field sports, steel traps, vivisection, the Church of England, the death certification procedure, and the government of Turkey. He also published two philosophical works.<br>
<br>Intelligent and humane, Greenwood described himself in an enclosure with a letter to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman as &#145;not a churchman&#146; but &#145;a strong advocate of impartial justice to all&#146;  (letter to Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, 3 June 1907, BL, Add. MS 41239). His motive for entering politics was, he said, his urgent desire for reform of the House of Lords&#151;a cause he had championed for many years. He might well have been in government but he did not enter parliament until his fifty-seventh year&#151;&#145;too late and long after I had left ambition in the rear&#146;  (Greenwood, letter to Lord Gladstone, 22 Dec 1909, BL, Add. MS 46068). In his <span class="italic">The Faith of an Agnostic</span> (2nd edn, 1919; under the pseudonym George Forrester), Greenwood sided with T. H. Huxley against clericalism and in support of science and agnostic rationalism, advocating that &#145;the sacred feeling of compassion should be extended so as to embrace all sentient beings&#146;  (p. 17). Greenwood lived at several London addresses including 53 Chester Square and, later, at 33 Linden Gardens. He died at the latter on 27 October 1928.<br>
