</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cook,  Peter Edward</span>  (1937&#150;1995), <span class="occ">humorist and entertainer</span>, was born on 17 November 1937 at Shearbridge, Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, Devon, the only son and eldest of the three children of Alexander Edward (Alec) Cook (<i>d</i>. 1984), colonial civil servant, and his wife, (Ethel Catherine) Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mayo (<i>d</i>. 1994). His father had a distinguished career in the colonial service as a district officer in Nigeria, later permanent secretary of its eastern region, and as financial secretary to the crown colony of Gibraltar; despite his numerous absences abroad it was a close and sustaining family to which Cook remained devoted throughout his life.<br>
<br>Cook was educated at Radley College and Pembroke College, Cambridge, at both of which institutions he gave evidence of a precocious talent for comedy, both as writer and performer, offstage and on. His characteristic style developed early: a contemporary at Radley described his ability to &#145;spin a whole fantastic web of absurdity from the merest thread of an idea or phrase&#146;  (Cook, 6). In particular he hit upon an <i>alter ego</i>&#151;based on a Mr Boylett, the school's high-table butler&#151;who would deliver obsessional monologues, in a droning, strangled voice, on various mundane subjects, often the nature and activities of insects. This creation, later metamorphosing into Mr Grole and E. L. Wisty, was central to Cook's comedy for the whole of his career.<br>
<br>Although Cook went up to Cambridge with the idea of joining the Foreign Office, his talents as a comedian and his charismatic personality pointed in a different direction. By the end of his second year, in summer 1959, his reputation had gone beyond the bounds of the university. His starring role performing his own material in that year's Footlights revue led to his being commissioned by the theatrical impresario Michael Codron to write the major part of a West End revue, <span class="italic">Pieces of Eight</span>, with Kenneth Williams in the cast and some additional material by the then little-known Harold Pinter, which opened at the Apollo Theatre in September. This was a more-or-less traditional revue (as was its successor, <span class="italic">One Over the Eight</span>, to which he was also the chief contributor), but that tradition was comprehensively scuppered by the project Cook became involved in the following year, immediately he left Cambridge.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Beyond the Fringe</span> was originally conceived by John Bassett as a late-night filler at the Edinburgh Festival to follow a production of <span class="italic">The Seagull</span> at the Lyceum Theatre. It featured Cook, Jonathan Miller, Alan Bennett, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76775/', "Dudley Moore")</script>, all recent Oxbridge graduates, performing their own material. There were no sets, plain costumes, no musical numbers, no dancing girls. Among its topics were capital punishment, Shakespeare, the nuclear threat, and the British nostalgia for war. Cook's principal solo pieces involved a Grole&#150;Wisty figure lamenting his failure to become a judge, and an impersonation of the prime minister, Harold Macmillan. The show, which opened in London in May 1961, was an instant triumph, not least because it caught&#151;indeed partially initiated&#151;a new mood in the country: an impatience with outmoded convention and a rejection of the deference accorded to public figures and institutions. It was, wrote Kenneth Tynan, &#145;the moment when English comedy took its first decisive step into the second half of the twentieth century&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 14 May 1961).<br>
<br>While still at Cambridge, Cook had been planning a cabaret theatre on the lines of the pre-war German satirical nightclubs &#145;which had done so much&#146;, as he put it, &#145;to prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Incorporated as a members-only club to avoid the stage censorship then exercised by the lord chamberlain, The Establishment opened in London in October 1961. In the summer of the following year he extended his influence in the so-called satire boom by buying a majority shareholding in <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> magazine. In October 1962 <span class="italic">Beyond the Fringe</span> went to Broadway, where it enjoyed another huge success, and Cook lost no time in developing a New York branch of The Establishment. He followed this up in 1964 by opening a straight theatre on the same premises. Its initial production, the American premi&egrave;re of Ann Jellico's <span class="italic">The Knack</span>, starred George Segal and was directed by Mike Nichols. In October 1963 he married Wendy Snowden, whom he had known since his Cambridge days; their two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, were born in 1964 and 1965 respectively.<br>
<br>Owing to financial difficulties, encountered while Cook was 3000 miles away, the London Establishment collapsed, and while its New York base continued to prosper for a time, this was the end of his career as an impresario. This was a pity, because he was an imaginative and resourceful producer with a gift for bringing the best out of his collaborators. On the other hand it freed him to concentrate on the thing he did better than anyone else&#151;being funny. In his case the public manifestation of his comedy&#151;on stage or television&#151;was the tip of a colossal iceberg: there were innumerable recollections of him in private embarking on vertiginous spirals of invention, spectacular connections, subversions of language and logic, through which fabulous worlds of ideas were created, flourished, and vanished, like the birth and death of little universes. It could be exhausting to everybody&#151;except him, because these weren't comic routines, this was just Cook's mind working.<br>
<br>Surprisingly enough for such an apparently solipsistic creative method, Cook's talent found its perfect expression, professionally speaking, in his partnership with Dudley Moore. In two series of <span class="italic">Not Only But Also</span>, made for the BBC between 1965 and 1967, they produced what many regarded as the finest sustained comedy ever to appear on British television. In particular, their Pete and Dud characters&#151;two lugubrious down-at-heels in flat caps, incessantly rambling on about the tedium of having famous female film stars invading their bedrooms and flaunting their &#145;busty substances&#146; at them&#151;became iconic figures, their south London whine imitated by half the population. The series were immensely popular, with John Lennon, Peter Sellers, and many others pleading to make guest appearances.<br>
<br>Cook, however, had ambitions beyond television, and was determined to break into feature films. He had already starred, with Moore and a big-name cast including Sellers, Tony Hancock, and Ralph Richardson, in <span class="italic">The Wrong Box</span> (1964), but had been constrained by a poor script (not his own). So in 1967, after the first two series of <span class="italic">Not Only</span>, he took a year off to write, on his own, an original screenplay. This was <span class="italic">Bedazzled</span> (1967), directed by Stanley Donen, a reworking of the Faust legend with Cook as the Devil and Moore as the downtrodden little failure whom he tempts with seven wishes in exchange for eternal damnation. His script was inventive and, unusually for someone whose normal approach to writing was so spontaneous, carefully crafted, but the result was muted in effect and proved commercially disappointing&#151;though not in continental Europe, where it was a big hit. It did, however, expose his limitations as a leading man for the movies, although he continued to harbour ambitions as a romantic lead and&#151;still less plausibly&#151;a rock singer. There followed a clutch of feature films, <span class="italic">A Dandy in Aspic</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Monte Carlo or Bust</span>, and <span class="italic">The Bed-Sitting Room</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer</span> (1970), all of which failed to enhance his reputation in that field.<br>
<br>Cook's television partnership with Moore resumed in 1970, with a third series of <span class="italic">Not Only</span> for the BBC, where his unique talents triumphantly reasserted themselves. In the autumn of the following year they took a stage show, <span class="italic">Behind the Fridge</span>, on a tour of Australia, then brought it first to London (1971) and subsequently, under the title <span class="italic">Good Evening</span>, to New York, where it ran for thirteen months, breaking the Broadway record for a two-man show. However, Cook's personal life had by then come under increasing strain: his marriage had broken up in 1970 and divorce followed the next year, Wendy Cook being given custody of their two daughters.<br>
<br>Although Cook immediately got engaged to the actress Judy Huxtable (she had been cited in the divorce case; they married in February 1974) the loss, as he saw it, of his daughters caused him immense distress. He developed an addiction to drugs and, especially, drink which dominated much of the rest of his life. It began to affect his work and in particular his relationship with Dudley Moore, who resented his increasingly erratic behaviour. Cook for his part vented some of his inner despair in occasionally vituperative behaviour towards Moore, some of which was painfully evident in the series of recordings issued under the rubric of <span class="italic">Derek and Clive</span>. The origin of these was a tape made privately in 1973 of improvised duologues, wildly if erratically funny and predominantly scatological, which became bootleg classics and were commercially released in 1976. The two succeeding albums, <span class="italic">Derek and Clive Come Again</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">Derek and Clive ad nauseam</span> (1979), were much blacker in tone, sometimes violently misogynist and scarcely funny at all&#151;though some would disagree. Cook's hatred of hypocrisy had become generalized rage, expressing itself in obscenity after obscenity. From now on the poise and elegance which had characterized his comedy emerged only fitfully, as in a piece he performed for the 1979 Amnesty International charity show <span class="italic">The Secret Policeman's Ball</span>, a devastating parody of the judge's summing up in the Jeremy Thorpe trial.<br>
<br>One constant in Cook's life was <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>. He was still sole proprietor (although he never paid himself a penny) and over the years an inspiring, if erratic, contributor. He was credited with the idea of a speech bubble attached to a photograph of a famous person, which thereafter became <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>'s trademark front cover. He also thought up the features &#145;Mrs Wilson's Diary&#146;, which ran throughout Harold Wilson's governments, and &#145;True Stories&#146;. Whenever somebody sued the magazine for libel&#151;James Goldsmith and Robert Maxwell being conspicuous examples&#151;he relished the opportunity to take a leading part in the trials and the invariably consequent fund-raising.<br>
<br>There were periods in which Cook fought his drink problem and much of his creative drive returned: 1980 saw a television special, <span class="italic">Peter Cook &amp; Co.</span>, where he teamed up with John Cleese and Rowan Atkinson among others, and he co-wrote and starred in the movie <span class="italic">Yellowbeard</span> (1982). The intervening year was spent in Los Angeles starring in a sitcom for CBS called <span class="italic">The Two of Us</span>. But much of the last decade of his life, by his own testimony, was passed in watching bad television, gambling, charity golf, and drinking. There were cameo appearances on television and in some largely forgettable films, probably the best of which was <span class="italic">Whoops Apocolypse!</span> (1985), a satire on the Falklands War, with Cook as a deranged prime minister in the Anthony Eden mould. His state of mind, to say nothing of his attempts to come off drink, were undermined by a series of personal blows. In 1984 his father died; his marriage to Judy Huxtable, passionate and turbulent as it had always been, came to an end in 1989.<br>
<br>Yet astonishingly, in the face of what seemed like determined self-destruction, Cook produced work which ranked beside the best of his achievements of the 1960s and 1970s. First, he took to ringing up a late-night radio phone-in show in the guise of Sven, a Norwegian fisherman deserted by his wife Jutte, anxious and confused, constantly falling back on the only subject he felt qualified to discuss, namely fish. Unpaid and unrecognized (it took Clive Bull, the show's host, some months before he realized to whom he was talking), this was Cook creating for creation's sake. More conventionally, he drew on an old character, Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling, for a series of twelve five-minute television interviews shown at Christmas 1990 under the title <span class="italic">A Life in Pieces</span>, reminiscing about his life in a manner which wove surreal fantasy with elements of Cook's own life. An extended version, now called <span class="italic">Why Bother?</span>, with Chris Morris as interviewer instead of Ludovic Kennedy, and with many more improvised flights of fancy, was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 1994.<br>
<br>A few months earlier Cook had recorded a special edition of the chat show <span class="italic">Clive Anderson Talks Back</span>, in which he was interviewed in four separate guises: a football manager, a rock star, a judge, and a man abducted by aliens. This was Cook once more in full command of his material, his characters, and himself, and seemed to herald a personal renaissance. Much of the credit for this was due to his third wife, Chiew Lin Chong, property consultant and daughter of Swee Loke Chung, businessman. They had met in 1982 and were married on 18 November 1989, immediately after his second divorce; Lin devoted herself to caring for him, trying to bring some calm and order into his life. But the renaissance was short-lived. In June 1994 he was devastated by the death of his mother, and on 9 January of the following year, in the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, he himself died from liver failure. A memorial service held at St John's parish church, Hampstead, in May 1995 was attended by innumerable friends and colleagues; it was a testament to the affection and admiration in which the most original comic talent of his generation had been held.<br>
