<span class="headword">Vernon,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1637, <em>d.</em> 1677), <span class="occ">traveller and diplomat</span>, was born in London near Charing Cross and was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 18 January 1637, the elder son of Francis Vernon (<i>d</i>. 1647) and his wife, Anne (formerly Welby), daughter of George Smithes, a goldsmith in London; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28243/', "James Vernon (bap. 1646, d. 1727)")</script> was his younger brother. He attended Westminster School between 1649 and 1654 and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 November 1654. He graduated BA on 28 January 1658 and proceeded MA on 17 July 1660. One of the leading scholars at Christ Church was the orientalist Edward Pococke, with whom Vernon later corresponded. It was probably Pococke who encouraged him to develop an interest in the Orient. After graduating Vernon spent several years on the move in Europe, and at one stage was captured by pirates. By March 1667 he was in Rome, an account of which he wrote for his mother. He was back in Oxford later in the year, when he composed a poem, printed with the title <span class="italic">Oxonium poema</span>, dealing with Oxford and its academic and student life.<br>
<br>Doubtless because of his &#145;great knowledge in many sciences and languages&#146;  (Rigaud, 2.243), the government decided to send Vernon on a diplomatic mission. He was initially selected to go to Sweden with the earl of Carlisle, but the decision was altered and he was sent instead to Paris in March 1669 with the embassy of Ralph Montagu. He remained in France until March 1672, apart from two brief visits to England in 1670 and 1671. His diplomatic duties were limited, most political correspondence of the embassy being conducted by his colleague, William Perwich. Vernon's chief responsibility was to keep track of the movement of British visitors, report to London any noteworthy incidents in which they were involved (crime and court cases being the most common), and render to well-connected travellers such assistance as they might require.<br>
<br>Vernon also made a point of mixing with scientists in Paris, and it is in this sphere that he was most prominent. He came to know members of the recently founded Academy of Sciences (1666), including Carcavy, Picard, Pecquet, Borelly, and Duhamel (who considered him a &#145;fort honneste homme, et tres capable&#146;; <span class="italic">Correspondence of Henry Oldenburg</span>, 7.33); but he was especially close to Jean-Dominique (Giandomenico) Cassini and Christiaan Huygens. With the latter he had many conversations, and he visited Huygens when the scientist fell dangerously ill in 1670. Vernon passed news of the academy, and of these and other scientists, to Henry Oldenburg, secretary of the Royal Society. Oldenburg valued Vernon's letters, not least because the Academy of Sciences kept its proceedings secret and had no formal relations with other scientific bodies. Knowing that he would keep Oldenburg informed, Huygens, Cassini, and others spoke to Vernon about meetings of the academy, and thanks in no small measure to Vernon's intermediary services, Oldenburg and the Royal Society were kept up to date with developments within it. Vernon sent them progress reports on the building of the Paris Observatory, whose design caused much controversy among astronomers in the academy. He also took a close interest in Picard's project to deduce the size of the earth by obtaining an improved estimate of a degree of meridian. Vernon transmitted to Hooke, on Picard's behalf, questions on pendulums. When Picard's <span class="italic">Mesure de la terre</span> came out in 1671 Vernon sent Oldenburg a long abstract of the book, which as yet was unavailable in London. Cassini regularly provided Vernon with the results of his observations, including his discovery of the star Japet in 1671. Cassini hoped to become a member of the Royal Society, an aspiration which Vernon brought to the attention of Oldenburg. In 1672 both Cassini and Vernon himself were elected. Other British scholars were in contact with Vernon. Pococke sent some of his works to the Sorbonne via Vernon, and the mathematician John Collins maintained a steady correspondence, paying tribute to his &#145;assistance and friendship &hellip; concern[ing] the advancement of learning and mathematics&#146;  (Rigaud, 1.139). Collins employed Vernon's good offices in arranging the purchase and transportation to England of mathematical and other scientific books published in France and Italy.<br>
<br>The Paris embassy was Vernon's only diplomatic posting. His political masters seem to have concluded, and perhaps he himself agreed, that diplomacy was not his forte. He now planned an ambitious journey which reflected the influence of Pococke: back through France to Italy, down the Dalmatian coast to Smyrna, and thence to Persia. He left England in 1673, proceeding at a leisurely pace. By January 1676 he had reached Smyrna, from where he sent a description of his travels to Oldenburg, who published it in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (24 April 1676). From there he proceeded across Asia Minor to Persia, which he reached early in 1677. Here he met disaster. He apparently engaged in a quarrel with a group of Arabs at Esfahan and was killed; he was buried two days later. One can presume that, had he completed his journey, he would have written more accounts for the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, and perhaps would have composed a comprehensive history of his travels, for this was an age when travel literature was in vogue. His premature death means that we possess only hints of what might have been.<br>
