<span class="headword">Marshall,  Geoffrey</span>  (1929&#150;2003), <span class="occ">political scientist</span>, was born on 22 April 1929 at 132 Chatsworth Road, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the son of Leonard William Marshall, engineer's fitter, and his wife, Kitty (or Kate), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner. Soon after his birth the family moved to Blackpool, where his mother kept a boarding-house. Educated at the Arnold School, Blackpool, Marshall shone both academically and on the football field. He was offered a place at Balliol College, Oxford, but chose to go in 1947 to Manchester University to study government and economics. In 1948 W. J. M. Mackenzie arrived as professor of government at Manchester and was an early influence on the young Marshall. In February 1950 Marshall attended Harold Laski's final series of lectures, delivered in Manchester, and edited them for publication, after Laski's death, as <span class="italic">Reflections on the Constitution</span> in 1951. The experience probably triggered his interest in constitutional issues. After graduation he remained at Manchester to complete an MA thesis on the political thought of David Hume.<br>
<br>In 1951 Marshall was appointed assistant lecturer in politics at Glasgow University, where he completed his doctorate, later published as <span class="italic">Political Sovereignty and the Commonwealth</span> (1957). This dealt with the constitutional controversy in South Africa, following the decision by the government of South Africa to abolish the entrenched sections of the constitution. In what became a familiar Marshall trait he dismissed grand theories of sovereignty. At Glasgow he forged a good relationship with Graeme Moodie and the two later wrote <span class="italic">Some Problems of the Constitution</span> (1959), portions of which grew out of informal conversations the two men had had when colleagues. The book exposed the ambiguities and misunderstandings about constitutional matters and punctured myths, including the idea that ministerial responsibility was an effective device for holding governments to account.<br>
<br>In 1954 Marshall moved to Nuffield College, Oxford, as a junior research fellow. Having decided that he would not impress the interviewing panel, he had over-indulged in the college hospitality beforehand. To his surprise he was offered the post. At Nuffield he became interested in jurisprudence, began reading for the bar, and met and soon married (on 10 August 1957) Patricia Anne Christine Woodcock, daughter of Edward Cecil Woodcock, engineer's designer. A graduate of St Anne's College, Oxford, she was Kenneth Robinson's research assistant at Nuffield. There were two sons of the marriage. From 1957 until his retirement forty-two years later, Marshall's career was spent at Queen's College, Oxford, as a fellow and tutor in politics, and as provost between 1993 and 1999. He was loyal to Queen's, turning down approaches for chairs from a number of leading universities and for Oxford's Gladstone chair of government and public administration, in succession to S. E. Finer. The chair carried with it a fellowship of All Souls College and it was typical of Marshall's dry humour and refusal to take himself too seriously that he noted that All Souls lacked both a car park and a squash court&#151;two essentials in his life.<br>
<br>Marshall was also involved in the life of the city and the university. He served as a university councillor on Oxford city council in 1967&#150;74 and was its last university sheriff, in 1971&#150;2. A member of the board of delegates to the university press, he was also active in the Political Studies Association and the Study of Parliament Group, becoming president of the latter in 1975. Although the queen's private secretary sometimes consulted him on constitutional matters, he was not one for taking public stands on issues of the day.<br>
<br>Between 1957 and 1981 Marshall was assistant editor of the journal <span class="italic">Public Law</span>, to which he contributed numerous reviews and articles on a wide range of subjects, including maladministration, police cars, official secrets, parliament, the rule of law, statutory interpretation, and precedent. His frequent reviews for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> were eagerly read for their gentle but effective puncturing of jargon or highfalutin theories. Tough-minded but gentle in manner, modest and humorous, he also wrote witty pieces for the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>It was almost a clich&eacute; to say that Marshall bridged the gap between the study of public law and politics. At the start of his career the two were closely interrelated. But as politics threw off legal formal approaches he ploughed something of a lonely furrow. It was often noted that his reputation was at least as high among public lawyers as among political scientists. His <span class="italic">Police and Government</span> (1965) was a study of the constitutional status of the constable and the rival claims made on the constable by local government and the Home Office. As in <span class="italic">Some Problems</span>, Marshall questioned the existing procedures for accountability and called for more effective checks on the executive and the creation of more opportunities for citizens to press for the redress of grievances. There followed <span class="italic">Constitutional Theory</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">Constitutional Conventions: the Rules and Forms of Political Accountability</span> (1984). These books confirmed Marshall's reputation as perhaps the leading British scholar on constitutional issues.<br>
<br>Marshall's concern to explore the ideas that lay behind institutions explains the greater debt he owed to jurisprudence and legal theory than to the social sciences. It also explains perhaps his interest in rigorous analysis of the meaning and history of concepts and theories. The clarity of his prose and the precision of his terms reflected his tidy mind. He argued that much of the talk among politicians and commentators of parliamentary accountability was a fiction. The conventions of ministerial and collective responsibility had been developed before the rise of the two-party system and interventionist government. These developments, in his view, had weakened the independence of parliament vis-&agrave;-vis the executive and thereby the citizens' ability to hold ministers to account. He also regretted how the British reliance on &#145;political&#146; rather than &#145;legal&#146; protection for citizens against abuses of power had encouraged the courts to be passive on administrative matters. He called for the development of administrative law, greater judicial review, and the creation of the office of a parliamentary ombudsman.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1999 Marshall's colleagues presented him with a volume of essays: <span class="italic">The Law, Politics and the Constitution</span>, edited by David Butler, Vernon Bogdanor, and Robert Summers. Marshall was short, wiry, and extremely fit, playing squash until a late age. During his final years he remained unassuming and approachable and much enjoyed the provostship at Queen's. Suffering from acute leukaemia, he died on 24 June 2003 at his home, 33 The Villas, Rutherway, Oxford, following a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Patricia, and their two sons.<br>
