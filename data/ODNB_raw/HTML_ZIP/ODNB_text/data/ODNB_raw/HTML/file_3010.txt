<span class="headword">Bourne,  Vincent</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1694, <em>d.</em> 1747), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was the son of Andrew Bourne and his wife, Ann. He was baptized in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London, on 22 July 1694. He attended Westminster School, and became queen's scholar in 1710. There he was a pupil of Robert Freind, and became proficient in the art of writing Latin verse; Westminster required its students to compose a number of epigrams in elegiac couplets every week, and it was to this medium that Bourne returned most frequently in later life. A number of his school verses appeared in the popular collection of Westminster compositions entitled <span class="italic">Lusus Westmonasterienses</span> that appeared in 1730 and went through several later editions.<br>
<br>Bourne was admitted as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 27 May 1714. He became a scholar on 13 May 1715, proceeded BA in 1717, was made a fellow in 1720, and commenced MA in 1721. At Cambridge he distinguished himself as a Latin poet, and was selected to write a set of tripos verses in the spring of 1717. In September of the same year he sent a friendly Latin poem to Joseph Addison to celebrate the latter's recovery from illness  (reproduced in Aikin, 2.214). In 1721 Bourne edited a collection of tripos verses entitled <span class="italic">Carmina comitalia Cantabrigiensia</span>, including, within a section of miscellaneous pieces at the end, five poems from his own pen and two by his friend John Jortin. Of these, Bourne's <span class="italic">Corydon querens</span>&#151;a translation of Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Colin's Complaint</span>&#151;was issued separately the same year and again in 1726.<br>
<br>On 14 May 1727 Bourne married Lucia (<i>b</i>. 1694?), widow of George Jewell, in St Margaret's, Westminster. (Jewell, who died in 1725 aged thirty-one, had attended Westminster and Trinity at the same time as Bourne, and was an usher at Westminster.) By this point Bourne had probably already become an usher at Westminster School himself, a position he held until his death. He and Lucia had a son, Thomas, and a daughter, Lucia; the family probably divided its time between the house Bourne had built in Westminster and his farm near Bungay, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Though generous and genial, Bourne was ill-suited to teaching: William Cowper, who was one of his pupils at Westminster, recalled that he was slovenly in appearance and idle, and so poor a teacher that &#145;he seemed determined, as he was the best, so to be the last, Latin poet of the Westminster line&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Prose</span>, 3.234). In 1734 the first collection of Bourne's work, <span class="italic">Poematia</span>, appeared: it was an instant success. A second edition emerged in 1735, and a third, with additional poems, in 1743; there were three more in the eighteenth century and a further five in the nineteenth (Mitford's, of 1840, is the closest to a scholarly edition). The book was dedicated to the duke of Newcastle, a former schoolmate of Bourne's, who may have been responsible for the poet's appointment as deputy serjeant-at-arms to the House of Commons in November 1734.<br>
<br>Alongside Bourne's translations from English poets (he also wrote versions from David Mallet, Matthew Prior, and John Gay), he produced many occasional pieces, which, though some were probably written as demonstrations for his pupils, are his best work. Bourne wrote without pretension, but with restrained elegance and bold mastery of Latin language and metre. The deceptive simplicity of his verse conceals numerous wry subtleties. A metropolitan, he had a particular genius for providing engaging portraits of contemporary London, and focused sympathetically upon the everyday details of human life. &#145;Schola rhetorices&#146;, for example, recalls the gossiping fishwives of Billingsgate, &#145;Cantatrices&#146; depicts two ballad singers at Seven Dials, and &#145;Ad Davidem Cook&#146; is an affectionate reminiscence of the Westminster nightwatchman. All these are rendered with a painterly eye for detail, and Bourne's love of art is visible in his several poems on painters and paintings, foremost among which are his hendecasyllables on Hogarth  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 190). The artist, whom Bourne calls &#145;derisor lepidus&#146; (&#145;elegant mocker&#146;) and &#145;facete censor&#146; (&#145;witty critic&#146;), is an apt recipient of his praise: while the poet lacked some of his addressee's satire, he shared his interests, and was doubtless aware that the same tags could be applied to himself. A certain discontent lies just below the surface of much of his poetry, and sometimes comes to the fore. The epitaph Bourne composed for himself seals this impression: &#145;in silentium quod amavit descendit&#146; (&#145;he has descended into the silence that he loved&#146;). Moreover, in a letter to his wife written shortly before his death (first printed in the 1772 edition of <span class="italic">Poematia</span>), he reveals that he refused to enter holy orders from a fear of his own insufficiency, and felt dissatisfaction with his life. Bourne died at Westminster on 2 December 1747, and was buried at Fulham.<br>
<br>Vincent Bourne was one of the most popular English Latin poets of the eighteenth century, but he has not won universal praise. His choice of homely matter and unwillingness to poeticize have led some critics to treat him high-handedly, while others have recognized that he managed to unshackle neo-Latin verse from outright imitation of the classics. The endurance of his fame has largely been due to the translations of his work by Cowper and Charles Lamb, but he merits nevertheless a central place in discussions of Anglo-Latin literature.<br>
