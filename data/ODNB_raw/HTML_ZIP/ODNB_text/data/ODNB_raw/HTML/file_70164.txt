<span class="headword">Winchevsky,  Morris</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Lippe Benzion Novochovitz]</span>  (1856&#150;1932), <span class="occ">socialist and Yiddish writer</span>, was born as Lippe Benzion Novochovitz to a pious Jewish family in Yanova, Lithuania, in the Russian empire on 9 August 1856. He and two younger sisters were the surviving children of Zissel (<i>d</i>. 1888) and Golda Novochovitz. Winchevsky's maternal grandparents were honoured in the town, the grandfather because he was killed for sympathizing with Polish rebels in 1831, the grandmother for lifelong charitable work. In 1861 the family moved to Kovno, a large town and a Jewish communal and cultural centre. Benzion went to <i>heder</i>, elementary Jewish school, until, aged eleven, he was sent to a Russian school for two years and then to a <i>Gymnasium</i> for a year. At the same time he studied the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with his father. Formal education ended with a few months at the government-sponsored enlightenment rabbinical school at Vilna. By this time, at the height of the Russian Jewish enlightenment, he was avidly reading its literature in Russian, Hebrew, and Yiddish. He abandoned religious life as a youth but, unlike many who did so, without significant conflict with his family. Winchevsky's literary career began in 1873 with articles for the Hebrew weekly <span class="italic">Ha-Maggid</span>. In the following year his father secured for him a position at a Jewish bank's branch in Oryol, outside the pale of settlement, where all Jews except a small minority had to live. Meetings with Russian radicals in Oryol were the beginning of Winchevsky's socialism. He wrote originally as Ben-Netz, and worked at the bank as Leopold Benedict; Morris Winchevsky, under which he acquired fame, came during the 1880s, and there were other occasional pseudonyms.<br>
<br>The decade between Oryol and a socialist Yiddish career in London was intellectually formative. Winchevsky's foremost mentors were the Russian socialist exile Pyotr Lavrov in Paris, who had several Jewish disciples, and Aaron Lieberman, the founder of Hebrew language socialism to whose publications Winchevsky contributed. Winchevsky's early writings already identified with downtrodden, impoverished Jews and scorned their petty bourgeois, pious oppressors. While writing occasionally in Hebrew, Winchevsky wrote largely in Yiddish, the plebeian tongue, in a fluent style replete with irony, wit, and phrases drawn from Jewish traditional literature.<br>
<br>The danger of arrest in Russia impelled Winchevsky to emigrate to Germany in 1874, where he settled in K&ouml;nigsberg. Arrested and briefly imprisoned in 1879 under the newly enacted anti-socialist laws, he was deported to Denmark and promptly went on to England. Attracted by the possibilities of agitation among the growing Jewish immigrant proletariat, he stayed in London until 1894. Winchevsky differed from his comrades who had to work in sweatshops by having clean, secure employment at the Seligman bank in London. As Benedict Novokhovitch he married on 23 June 1886, in a Jewish ceremony at 29 Colchester Street, Whitechapel, Rebecca (<i>b</i>. 1865/6), daughter of Harris Salligaller, traveller. They had a son and a daughter, born in 1887 and 1888. Bank employment and family life were kept separate from socialist endeavours.<br>
<br>In 1879 Winchevsky composed the first Yiddish socialist tract, <span class="italic">Yehi Or</span> (&#145;Let there be light&#146;), published in 1885. Following several years of agitation, he joined E. W. Rabbinowitz to publish the first Yiddish, cautiously socialist weekly newspaper, <span class="italic">Der Poylisher Yidl</span> (&#145;The Little Polish Jew&#146;). When Rabbinowitz drew the newspaper away from socialism Winchevsky quit and joined a new revolutionary socialist weekly, <span class="italic">Der Arbayter Freind</span> (&#145;The worker's friend&#146;), which was also radically anti-religious. After it was taken over by anarchists in 1891 Winchevsky again left and took part in a new venture, <span class="italic">Fraye Velt</span> (&#145;Free world&#146;). In these and later periodicals he was much in demand for his literary skill. As a socialist he went his own way, indifferent to party doctrines and with little ideological consistency, upholding socialism as an ethical demand for justice. Although he was later called a Marxist, Marxism does not appear significantly in his work.<br>
<br>When the movement in England declined Winchevsky, like most of its leaders, moved to the United States in 1894, where there was a vast, rapidly increasing immigrant Jewish proletariat. He commenced his American career as editor of the short-lived Yiddish weekly <span class="italic">Der Emes</span> (&#145;Truth&#146;) in Boston, a &#145;family newspaper&#146; of &#145;literature and [socialist] enlightenment&#146;. Back in New York city, Winchevsky was a founder with Abraham Cahan in 1897 of the hugely successful Yiddish daily <span class="italic">Forverts</span> (&#145;Forward&#146;). He later broke with Cahan and edited <span class="italic">Di Tsukunft</span> (&#145;The future&#146;), a political and literary monthly, and took part in many other Yiddish socialist publications, as well as writing verse and plays. His life was tied to the Jewish socialist movement, where his strength as a writer lay in his homely, witty style which used puns, proverbs, and anecdotes from Jewish life and religious literature.<br>
<br>After decades of supporting cosmopolitan internationalism in Yiddish guise, Winchevsky shifted to a more ethnic, nearly Zionist position during the First World War. He joined the bourgeois American Jewish delegation to the Versailles peace conference in 1919 on behalf of Jewish minority rights in eastern Europe, yet in 1921 he affiliated himself with the communists because in Soviet Russia a secular Yiddish culture of the masses was developing. He visited the Soviet Union in triumph in 1924&#150;5, but declined the lifetime pension he was offered and returned to America, where he lived out his years in need. By then he was called the grandfather of his movement. From 1927 Winchevsky was disabled, apparently by a stroke, but was brought to a public celebration of his seventy-fifth birthday. Winchevsky died on 18 March 1932 in the Bronx, New York. His family's acceptance of the socialist, anti-communist Workmen's Circle offer of burial in its Mount Carmel cemetery in Queens, New York city, within the section of heroes of the Jewish labour movement, angered the communists. Police were needed to control the large, quarrelling crowd at Winchevsky's funeral.<br>
