<span class="headword">Martin,  William</span>  (1767&#150;1810), <span class="occ">naturalist and actor</span>, was born at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the son of Joseph Martin, a hosier, and Ann Mallatratt (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1819), both from Mansfield. About 1769 he and his mother were abandoned; Joseph Martin moved to Ireland as an actor, adopted the name Booth, and, after extraordinary new careers as portrait painter, inventor (of the polygraphic process for copying oil paintings), and patentee (of new methods of making cloth and linen), died in London in 1797. Martin's mother, forced to support herself and son, likewise chose an acting career, and tried to educate her son at the best schools available to her itinerant lifestyle and straitened circumstances.<br>
<br>William Martin took to the stage aged five. About 1778, he took drawing and writing lessons from James Bolton (1735&#150;1799) of Stannary, near Halifax. Bolton took great interest in, and published much on, natural history. He proved a crucial influence on Martin. In 1782 Martin settled with Stanton's company of actors in the Peak District of Derbyshire where, in 1785, he first met fellow naturalist White Watson (1760&#150;1835). Martin's first scientific publication, on ants, appeared in 1788. Although he continued to dabble in zoology, some time before 1789&#151;inspired by the geologist Abraham Mills FRS (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1828)&#151;he started to study the fossil and mineral riches of the Peak District. In May 1789 he issued the prospectus of a joint work with Watson, which he would engrave, on the minerals, spars, and fossils of Derbyshire. But their collaboration proved impossible when Watson, who was to contribute the minerals, failed to deliver. The first five parts, of an intended fourteen, of Martin's own <span class="italic">Figures and Descriptions of Petrifactions &hellip; in Derbyshire</span>, appeared between 1794 and 1796, with all text and most of the drawing, etching, and colouring of the twenty-nine plates by him. These were the first coloured illustrations of British fossils and Martin was elected fellow of the Linnean Society in 1796, when his paper on fossil brachiopods was also read.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1797, at Stoke-on-Trent, Martin married Mrs Mary Adams, &#145;an unfortunate but interesting young widow &hellip; and actress&#146;  (Hull, 560). Martin's full-time acting career was soon part-exchanged for a new career as writing-master, from 1798 at Burton upon Trent, then from 1800 in Buxton, and finally from 1805 at Macclesfield, also at the King's School there. In 1800 Martin was sending fossils and minerals to James Sowerby (1757&#150;1822), who illustrated many of them. In the same year, he bought a fourth share in the Buxton theatre (where he continued acting in their midsummer season until 1809).<br>
<br>Martin's book <span class="italic">Outlines &hellip; of Extraneous Fossils</span>, the first systematic study of general palaeontology and of fossilization in English, was published in April 1809. Its publication led to Martin's election as corresponding member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and, in June, honorary membership of the Geological Society of London. The book also inspired John Farey (1766&#150;1826) to visit Martin at Macclesfield in April 1809. Farey offered to collaborate in preparing a detailed geological map, in an attempt to improve the stratigraphic knowledge of Derbyshire fossils. However, their second meeting (intended for September 1809 at Sir Joseph Banks's house at Overton) had to be abandoned, as Martin was seriously ill with consumption. Nevertheless, Martin's second book, dedicated to Banks, <span class="italic">Petrificata Derbiensia</span>, was published in August 1809. It completed his earlier work and described the Carboniferous limestone and other fossils of Derbyshire, and was illustrated with his own engravings. Owing to his illness, the intended second volume, on fossils (especially plants) from coal strata, never appeared. Martin died on 31 May 1810 at Back Street, Macclesfield, leaving no provision for his widow, six young children, or his aged mother. He was buried on 3 June at Christ Church, Macclesfield. Subscriptions were made to support his dependants, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18221/', "William Charles Linnaeus Martin (1798&#150;1864)")</script>. Martin was honoured with the brachiopod genus <i>Martinia</i> named after him in 1844, as was one of the most characteristic Derbyshire fossil corals, <i>Lithostrotion martini</i>, in 1851.<br>
