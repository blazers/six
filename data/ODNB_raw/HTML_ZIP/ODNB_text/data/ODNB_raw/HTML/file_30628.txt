<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bartlett, Sir  Frederic Charles</span>  (1886&#150;1969), <span class="occ">psychologist</span>, was born in Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, on 20 October 1886, the second son of William Bartlett, master bootmaker, and his wife, Temperance Matilda Howman. He was educated at home in his teens, his health being thought too poor, following an attack of pleurisy, for him to go away to school. This apparent handicap allowed him to read very widely, and to spend time walking in the Gloucestershire countryside. He preserved throughout his life a tendency to observe human everyday activity and to base psychological thought upon that observation, rather than upon academic thinking.<br>
<br>As an external student of London University, Bartlett obtained first-class honours in philosophy in 1909 and an MA with special distinction in 1911. He moved next to Cambridge; he had by this time strong interests in sociological questions, and was attracted to St John's College, where W. H. R. Rivers was active. Rivers combined anthropological interests with a belief in the importance of experimental measurements of the performance of individual people and he encouraged Bartlett to work in the new laboratory of experimental psychology under C. S. Myers. Bartlett graduated in 1914, obtaining a first in part one of the moral sciences tripos, and then became assistant director of the laboratory. His health made him unfit for military service, whereas Myers and Rivers left Cambridge for the duration of the war, leaving Bartlett with the major responsibility for the laboratory. Even when they returned to Cambridge, Myers soon left again, and Rivers died; thus from 1922 Bartlett became director of the psychological laboratory and reader in experimental psychology. In 1920 he married Emily Mary (<i>d</i>. 1974), daughter of William Henry Smith JP, of Helmshore, Lancashire, herself a psychologist from the early days in Cambridge; they had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1931 Bartlett was made the first professor of experimental psychology in Cambridge, a post which he retained until he retired in 1952. During the thirty-year period of directing the laboratory he developed it from one assistant to over seventy staff and research workers, and trained many remarkable students. In the post-war years the chairs at Oxford, Cambridge, London, and numerous other universities were for a substantial time all occupied simultaneously by Bartlett's former students. His achievements within the university were accompanied after 1939 by much public service. The war created a need for more information about people's performance under stress, their sensory abilities, and their ability to operate such devices as radar screens, target indicators, or tank gunnery controls. Bartlett served on the flying personnel research committee of the Air Ministry, and also on the Medical Research Council, and his laboratory in Cambridge became a centre for investigations of this kind. This work led to design improvements in the devices themselves and to changes in the models used to understand human behaviour.<br>
<br>Bartlett was assisted in his wartime research by K. J. W. Craik, who was one of the first to see the possible use in psychology of explanations derived from cybernetics and control engineering. Bartlett actively encouraged Craik's ideas, and following Craik's tragic accidental death in 1945, Bartlett fostered a group of research workers developing similar theories. Characteristically, Bartlett's own interest in control processes was stimulated not only by intellectual influences, but also by his keen interest in cricket and tennis. He would frequently discuss the ways in which the everyday behaviour of the player making a stroke required the psychologist to suppose that each action was controlled by a computed model of future events, a process far more complex than the simple theories of classical psychology.<br>
<br>After the war, Bartlett's research on human performance and machine design was extended to industrial problems: from 1944 the Medical Research Council maintained an applied psychology research unit within Bartlett's department, and after his retirement he continued to act as a consultant to it, as well as taking part energetically in committee work on the problem of improving the efficiency of individuals at work.<br>
<br>Bartlett's scientific thought was highly original and unconventional at the time, but was later widely accepted. Of the ten books which he wrote, or to which he contributed, the best-known is <span class="italic">Remembering</span> (1932), in which he reported a lengthy series of experiments on perception and on memory, which showed that human awareness of events was both selective and constructive: much which struck the eye was never seen or remembered, and conversely a great deal was thought to have been perceived or recalled which had not in fact occurred. This, as well as the choice of the items which were correctly reported, showed that perception and remembering were controlled by some process sensitive to the purposes and interests of the individual concerned. This line of thought departed from current orthodoxies, which, whether behaviourist or gestaltist, saw human awareness as passively determined by the pattern of present events or of past experience. Though they owed something to the work of Rivers, Myers, James Ward, whom he had known in Cambridge, and the neurologist Henry Head, Bartlett's ideas largely originated with his own observation of human behaviour, and <span class="italic">Remembering</span> is copiously illustrated with cases in which Africans had selectively remembered events of little importance to Britons or vice versa.<br>
<br>Bartlett was kindly, encouraging, and informal. He inspired enthusiasm, and could bring out the value in even the humblest contribution. His influence spread more through discussion classes and informal meetings than through his exciting lectures.<br>
<br>From 1924 to 1948, an unenviably long tour of office, Bartlett was editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Psychology</span>. He was president of section J (psychology) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1929. He was elected FRS in 1932, the only psychologist so honoured for many years. He was created CBE in 1941 and knighted in 1948. He was president (1950) and honorary fellow (1954) of the British Psychological Society, and was an honorary member of the Experimental Psychology Society of the UK (1960). He was a foreign member or associate of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Psychologie, of the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, of the US National Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and an honorary member of a number of foreign psychological societies. He received honorary degrees from Athens, Princeton, Louvain, London, Edinburgh, Oxford, and Padua. He also received the Baly and the Huxley medals (1943), the royal medal of the Royal Society (1952), the Longacre award of the Aero Medical Association (1952), and the gold medal of the International Academy of Aviation and Space Medicine (1964).<br>
<br>To the end of his life Bartlett took an active interest in new developments in psychology, which he discussed with a worldwide network of leading investigators who always found his comments worth seeking. He died in Cambridge on 30 September 1969; his wife survived him.<br>
