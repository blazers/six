<span class="headword">Abu Bakar</span> <span class="st"> [Abu Bakar ibni al-Marhum Dato Temenggong Sri Maharaja Tun Ibrahim]</span>  (1833&#150;1895), <span class="occ">sultan of Johore</span>, was born in Teluk Belanga, Singapore, most probably on 3 February 1833, the eldest son of Daing Ibrahim (1810&#150;1862) and his first wife, Encik Ngah (also known as Tengku Andak), daughter of Sultan Abdul Rahman of Pahang. His grandfather had been the hereditary temenggong (defence minister) of the sultan of Riau-Lingga, whose empire was partitioned following agreements in 1819&#150;24 by which Britain acquired Singapore. As a result the temonggong had been left in charge of most of mainland Johore. Daing Ibrahim was installed as temenggong in 1841 and set about developing his domain. He encouraged the settlement of Chinese immigrants and courted British officials and businessmen in Singapore. As part of his modernizing strategy he enrolled Abu Bakar at the English-medium academy that Benjamin Keasberry ran in Singapore. From 1855, when he became heir apparent, Abu Bakar played an increasingly active role in state government, and in 1858 he persuaded his father to move its headquarters from Singapore to Tanjong Putri (later Johore Bahru) on the mainland.<br>
<br>Abu Bakar succeeded his father as temenggong on 1 February 1862. One of his first decisions was to develop Johore Bahru as the state capital. The administrative apparatus remained rudimentary, but it did feature a state council, treasury, police stations, and provision for local government and education. The economy grew, and revenue increased. Abu Bakar encouraged European investment and oversaw the expansion of land under cultivation. He continued his father's scheme (<i>kangchu</i>) of licensing Chinese entrepreneurs to cultivate pepper, gambier, and later tea and coffee, and to them he farmed out the taxation of opium and spirits. At a time when Britain was intervening in failing Malay states, Abu Bakar consolidated his grip on Johore. Thus, on the death of the last sultan of Riau in 1877, he gained the territory of Kesang-Muar. He also embarked on &#145;a flamboyant diplomatic offensive&#146;  (Trocki, 191). He acted as an intermediary between the British and other Malay rulers, although his attempts to extend his influence over the latter were checked. He paid frequent and prolonged visits overseas and was received by Queen Victoria, the emperor of Japan, and the Ottoman sultan. In these ways he raised his standing in the eyes of those who had hitherto regarded the temenggongs as upstarts. His royal status was confirmed in 1868 when both the Riau court and the British government recognized him as maharaja, equivalent to a high-ranking Indian prince. Observing that in &#145;his tastes and habits he is an English gentleman&#146;, the governor of the Straits Settlements commended Abu Bakar's commitment to the &#145;advancement and civilization of his people&#146; and his deep attachment to &#145;the British government and nation&#146;  (Cowan, 38&#150;9). By the 1880s, however, another governor, Sir Frederick Weld, regarded him as (in the historian Eunice Thio's words) a &#145;pretentious and rather unreliable potentate&#146; whose wings should be clipped  (Thio, 100).<br>
<br>In 1885 Abu Bakar had little choice but to conclude an agreement whereby he surrendered Johore's external relations to Britain, excluded from his state western concessionaries (other than British), and agreed to accept a British agent. For their part the British recognized Abu Bakar as sultan and his state as independent. Moreover, they refrained from appointing an agent, whose status and powers would in any case have fallen short of those of a resident. Furthermore, while Abu Bakar was content to assist the colonial governor, for example in his dealings with the sultan of Pahang, he astutely parried the governor's attempts to interfere in Johore by communicating directly with the Colonial Office through the Johore advisory board that he set up in London. His position as sovereign ruler of an independent state was confirmed in the high court in 1893 when an attempt by Jenny Mighell to sue him for breach of promise of marriage was dismissed on the grounds that he was not subject to British jurisdiction. Two years later he promulgated a written constitution, which kept British expansion at bay and enhanced the image of the sultanate as a progressive monarchy.<br>
<br>Abu Bakar married first, at Pahang in June 1858, Encik Wan Chik (also known as Che' Engku Chick) (<i>b</i>. 1843), daughter of Bendahara Tahir of Pahang and his wife, Tunku Chik, daughter of the sultan of Kedah. He married second, in 1870, Cecilia Catherina Lange 
    (also known as Zubaida; 1849&#150;1936)
  , daughter of Mads Johansen Lange, a Danish resident of Bali, and Nonya Sang Nio, daughter of the kapitan china of Kuta in Bali. He married third, at Singapore in December 1885, Fatima (<i>d</i>. 1891), daughter of the orang kaya of Ringgit. He married fourth, at Istanbul on 22 September 1893, Khadija (<i>d</i>. 1904), who was of Turkish origin. He had a son and four daughters. He died at Bailey's Hotel, Kensington, on 4 June 1895. His remains were taken back to Johore Bahru and interred on 7 September in the royal mausoleum, Makam Diraja Mahmudiah. He was mourned in Britain as a &#145;valued friend and ally&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 June 1895) and came to be revered in Malaya as the &#145;father of modern Johore&#146;. During his reign Johore had certainly become a more efficient and prosperous Malay state without succumbing to formal British control. Yet both its autonomy and its Malay identity had been compromised by the economic pull of neighbouring Singapore and a growing dependence on Chinese enterprise. Furthermore, modernization had been curbed by Abu Bakar's style of personal rule; his pursuit of prestige and prolonged absences abroad had distracted government and sorely depleted the treasury.<br>
<br>Abu Bakar was succeeded as <span class="occ">sultan of Johore</span> by his son <a name="cosubject_98157"></a><span class="headword">Ibrahim</span> <span class="st"> [Ibrahim Iskandar al-Masyhur ibni al-Marhum Sultan Abu Bakar]</span>  (1873&#150;1959). He was born on 17 September 1873 at Istana Bidadari, Singapore, Abu Bakar's only son with his second wife, Cecilia Lange. He was educated privately. In 1890 he joined the Johore military forces and served as aide-de-camp to his father for the rest of his reign. He paid the first of many visits to Europe in 1890&#150;91, when his father introduced him to European royalty, and on his return he was installed as tunku mahkota (crown prince). He was proclaimed sultan on the day his father was buried and he was crowned on 2 November 1895 in a ceremony described at the time as &#145;a curious mixture of Oriental and European customs&#146;  (Gullick, <span class="italic">Malay Society</span>, 46).<br>
<br>Ibrahim was as jealous of Johore's independence as his father had been, but he had been inadequately prepared for the problems facing him on accession. Still a young man, he preferred sowing wild oats to attending to affairs of state. It seems that, during the three-month interval between the death and interment of his father, Ibrahim's claim to the throne was contested within the dynasty. This episode probably strengthened his determination to centralize power on himself at the risk of breaching the state constitution and further alienating his relatives. He soon clashed with the British over the construction of a railway that would eventually pass through Johore to link Singapore with the rest of British Malaya. He further alarmed them by making generous land grants to European concessionaries. In spite of his headstrong approach to government, Johore escaped incorporation within the federation of British protected states (the Federated Malay States, inaugurated in 1895&#150;6), and for over a decade he staved off Britain's threats to appoint an agent to his court as it was entitled to do under the 1885 treaty. In 1909, however, he was induced to accept an adviser, who was renamed general adviser five years later and endowed with additional powers. Even so, the British failed to achieve the degree of hegemony that they enjoyed elsewhere in the peninsula, since Ibrahim cannily negotiated a number of face-saving arrangements relating to flags, salutes, reporting lines, and Johore's own military forces.<br>
<br>In his subsequent dealings with the British government, Ibrahim insisted that Johore was unique among Malay states. He opposed British designs in the 1920s and 1930s to bring the nine Malay states within a common administrative system, a policy that somewhat misleadingly was called decentralization. As he matured, he took a keener interest in the administration of his country and vigorously promoted land use. Johore prospered from tin mining and especially the rubber boom, and the sultan amassed an immense personal fortune. Notwithstanding spats with British officialdom, he strongly supported the British connection. In 1915 he personally led the Johore military forces in the suppression of a mutiny of Indian troops in Singapore. He appreciated the strategic significance of his state, which faced Singapore across the causeway (completed in 1923), and took a keen interest in the construction of the island's naval base. Between 1931 and 1941 he also donated large sums to the imperial war chest. While some of his fixations tried their patience, Whitehall officials took care to ensure that the sultan's contributions received recognition; he was appointed honorary GCMG (1916), honorary GBE (1935), and honorary major-general in the British army (1947), and he rode in the carriage processions at the coronations of George VI and Elizabeth II.<br>
<br>Ibrahim spent the Japanese occupation (1942&#150;5) cooped up in one of his palaces in relatively spartan conditions. Although, as senior sultan, he was obliged to preside over a meeting of Malay rulers in 1942 to discuss co-operation with the new regime, the British completely absolved him of any taint of collaboration. He welcomed their return in September 1945 and without demur immediately fell in with their plans for post-war Malaya. Whether he was disconcerted by the unsettled circumstance in which it was presented or merely failed to comprehend its import, he signed a new treaty that empowered the British to include Johore in the Malayan Union, a centralized colony embracing all the Malay states. Leading Johore Malays were so incensed by their sultan's surrender of sovereignty that some conspired to dethrone him. The crisis was swiftly defused, however; the British eventually scrapped the Malayan Union, and Ibrahim regained his poise. He resumed his trips to Europe and once again defied challenges to his authority. Nevertheless, while he was away from home the suspicion his conduct had aroused at the time of the Malayan Union continued to fester in Johore.<br>
<br>During the Malayan emergency (1948&#150;60) Ibrahim boldly supported British military operations against the largely Chinese guerrilla forces of the Malayan Communist Party. Yet he did not share Britain's sympathy with the aspirations of Malay political leaders. He sacked his chief minister, Dato Onn bin Jaafar, on account of his leadership of the United Malays National Organization, and he later ridiculed Tunku Abdul Rahman's demand for independence. As the British prepared to withdraw from Malaya he foresaw a future in which Johore would be absorbed into a nation state controlled from the federal capital of Kuala Lumpur by elected politicians. He therefore tried to preserve his special relationship with Britain by retaining the British adviser in Johore Bahru, but to no avail. Ibrahim celebrated the diamond jubilee of his reign with panache in 1955, but in August 1957 he declined to be considered for the position of first constitutional monarch of independent Malaya.<br>
<br>Ibrahim married six times. His first wife, whom he married in Singapore on 5 October 1892, was Maimuna (1876&#150;1909), daughter of Ungku Abdul Majid. He married second, in 1897, Ruqaiya (1880&#150;1926), who was probably of Indian origin. He married third Hasana (<i>b</i>. 1877), daughter of Dato Jaafar bin Haji Muhammad, first chief minister of Johore, and half-sister of Dato Sir Onn bin Jaafar. His fourth marriage, in 1926, was to Intan (<i>d</i>. 1958), daughter of Ungku Ahmad. He married fifth, in London on 15 October 1930, Helen Wilson (1889&#150;1977), the divorced wife of Dr William Brockie Wilson and daughter of John Bartholomew, tool manufacturer, of Glasgow; they were divorced on 31 December 1937. Ibrahim's last marriage, in London on 6 November 1940, was to Marcella Mendl (1915&#150;1982), the daughter of Edgar Mendl, of Romania. He had four sons (one of whom died in infancy) and one daughter.<br>
<br>Ibrahim was an imposing figure. In his prime he was respected as the most energetic and competent Malay ruler in the peninsula. On the other hand, he was self-indulgent, had an unpredictable temper, and his private life was peppered with scandal. He was frequently in bitter dispute with his sons. A hunter of big game, he also presented pairs of tigers and bears to the London zoo and was a fellow of Scotland's zoological society. He pioneered motoring in Malaya, and lordly road-rage became him. From the late 1920s onwards he spent long periods in Europe, ostensibly for health reasons, although he delighted in the comforts of London society. He died at London's Grosvenor House Hotel on 8 May 1959. His body was transported to Singapore in the ship <i>Willem Ruys</i> and buried on 7 June in the royal mausoleum, Makam Diraja Mahmudiah, in Johore Bahru. He was succeeded as sultan by his eldest son, Ismail. His grandson, Sultan Iskandar, later conferred upon him the posthumous title of &#145;the Great&#146; (al-Masyhur) but others remembered Ibrahim as a capricious autocrat.<br>
