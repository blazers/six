<span class="headword">Lane,  Jane</span>, Lady Fisher  (<em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">royalist heroine</span>, was the third daughter of Thomas Lane (1585&#150;1660) and Anne Bagot (<i>b</i>. 1589, <i>d</i>. in or after 1651), who married at Blithfield, Staffordshire, on 10 February 1610. Her father, &#145;a person of excellent reputation&#146;, resided at Bentley Hall, near Wolverhampton, and had &#145;a fair estate&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.199) worth &pound;700 a year, while her mother was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76480/', "Sir Hervey Bagot (1591&#150;1660)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71871/', "Bagot family (per. c.1490&#150;1705)")</script>], a wealthy baronet and MP for Staffordshire in the Long Parliament. Both families were royalists during the civil war. Thomas Lane served as a commissioner of array in 1642&#150;3, while Jane's eldest brother, John, fought in the king's army as the colonel of a cavalry regiment and in 1643&#150;4 was successively governor of Charles I's garrisons in Stafford and Rushall Hall. In May 1644 Bentley Hall was extensively looted by parliamentary forces.<br>
<br>Following his defeat at the battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, Charles II went into hiding, and by 8 September was at Moseley Hall, a few miles from Bentley. Having availed himself of a pass which Jane had recently obtained from the parliamentary governor of Stafford to visit a pregnant kinswoman, Ellen Norton, at Abbots Leigh near Bristol, he accompanied her as a manservant, under the assumed name of William Jackson. After spending the night at Bentley, Charles set off on the morning of 10 September, mounted on horseback before &#145;Mistress Lane&#146;. According to an account published at the Restoration, over the next week the king's protectress &#145;comported herself with extraordinary prudence and fidelity&#146;  (Eglesfield, 212), particularly in the streets of Stratford upon Avon, where she and her royal companion collided with a troop of parliamentarian cavalry, a moment of extreme danger which she surmounted by a cool composure. As one contemporary ballad had it:<blockquote>
<div>In vain ye search, Bloodthirsty Men, to find<br>
</div>
<div>Vailed Majesty; her Virtue makes you blind;<br>
</div>
<div>Her faith out-acts your Malice; and your swords<br>
</div> (Broadley, 219)</blockquote>As they were accommodated at various inns on their southward progress, &#145;the loyal lady&#146;  (Eglesfield, 212) was always extremely solicitous about Charles's welfare, making sure that &#145;a good bed&#146; was &#145;provided for him&#146; and that he received the best food, &#145;which she often carried herself&#146; to his chamber  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.202). Her solicitude was equally on display during his four-day sojourn at Abbots Leigh, and her quick thinking provided an excuse for Charles to move on to Trent, Somerset, despite the distraction of Mistress Norton's serious illness following a miscarriage. She counterfeited a letter to the effect that her father's serious illness required her immediate departure for Bentley, a ploy which worked admirably. After accompanying Charles to Trent, on 18 September she returned to Staffordshire, only to be forced to take flight herself when on 14 October information about her involvement in his escape was presented to the council of state. While troops fruitlessly searched Bentley Hall, she trudged on foot, disguised as &#145;a country wench&#146;  (Dauncey, 146), to Yarmouth, from where she took ship to France.<br>
<br>When Jane arrived in Paris in mid-December 1651, she was welcomed by the English court in exile. Charles, who had landed in France two months before, greeted her with the salutation &#145;Welcome my life&#146;  (Eglesfield, 233) and conveyed her in his own coach to the Louvre to meet Henrietta Maria, with whom she developed a particularly close relationship. She was reputed a woman of &#145;an acute wit&#146; and &#145;an excellent disputant&#146;, though no beauty, and all the &eacute;migr&eacute; royalists were said to &#145;extremely adore her&#146;  (<span class="italic">French Intelligencer</span>, 5, 16&#150;23 Dec 1651, 36), including John Evelyn and his wife, whom she visited on 21 December. Although <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> reported on 16 December that as &#145;a firm Presbyterian&#146;  (p. 1283) she refused to attend prayer book services with the king, he still held her &#145;in great esteem&#146;, and such was the &#145;merry discourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">French Intelligencer</span>, 5, 16&#150;23 Dec 1651, 36) between them that in March 1652 Sir John Finch reported a rumour that she had become Charles's mistress. This was probably false, though in several letters of May and June 1655 Charles's sister Mary, princess of Orange, referred to her in jest as his &#145;wife&#146;, while in March 1656 his aunt Elizabeth of Bohemia informed him of &#145;a wittie&#146; but &#145;foolish&#146; and &#145;malicious&#146; libel circulating in The Hague that his former preserver &#145;lay with your Majestie&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 1.674). Jane herself was alleged to have brushed aside &#145;this ogley bisness&#146;, convinced of her own &#145;good carettor&#146; and hoping that her detractors would not diminish her standing with the king &#145;which shall be the study of my wholl [life] to preserve&#146;  (Broadley, 34).<br>
<br>By autumn 1652 Jane had entered the service of the princess of Orange, probably at the instigation of Charles, who wrote to her from Paris of his great debt to her. The princess proved a &#145;most obliging&#146; employer, for which she was thanked by Charles  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 1786, 3.153); Jane was one of her attendants when she visited Frankfurt with Charles in October 1655. By this time, however, Jane claimed he was neglecting her, an accusation he denied. Having returned to The Hague, in July 1656 she was courted by Lord Newburgh, but this came to nothing.<br>
<br>At the Restoration the king granted Jane an annual pension of &pound;1000 and gave her many gifts, including portraits and a lock of his hair. On 19 December 1660 parliament, in gratitude for her service to the monarchy, gave her &pound;1000 to purchase a jewel. Two years later, on 8 December 1662, Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, conducted her marriage to Sir Clement Fisher (<i>bap</i>. 1613, <i>d</i>. 1683), baronet, of Packington, Warwickshire, MP for Coventry. Fisher had served as a captain in her brother John's regiment during the first civil war and had played host to him and Lord Wilmot as they shadowed Charles during his journey to Abbots Leigh in 1651. The Fishers had no children. After Sir Clement's death on 15 April 1683 Lady Fisher remained at Packington. By Lady day that year her state pension had fallen &pound;6500 in arrears; this and her own extravagance placed her considerably in debt. She died on 9 September 1689, allegedly leaving &#145;but &pound;10 behind&#146; and observing that &#145;her hands should be her executors&#146;  (Burrows); she was buried at Packington three days later. The most famous of several surviving portraits of Jane depicts her allegorically with the crown of England in her right hand, over which she has partially drawn her lace veil to conceal it from the danger posed by a hydra (the Rump Parliament?) looming up on her left side.<br>
