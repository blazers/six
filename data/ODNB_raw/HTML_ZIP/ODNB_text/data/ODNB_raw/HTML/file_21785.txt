<span class="headword">Pelgrim,  Joyce</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1526?), <span class="occ">publisher and bookseller</span>, is first heard of when, with others in the book trade, he applied to have his appearance recorded, although nothing is known of their business. In 1504 an edition of the <span class="italic">Ortus vocabulorum</span> was printed for him in Paris. In 1506, in partnership with another stationer, Henry Jacobi, he issued a book of hours and a psalter according to the use of Sarum, and an edition of Lyndewode's <span class="italic">Provinciale</span>, at which time Jacobi lived at the sign of the Trinity, and Pelgrim at the sign of St Anne, both in St Paul's Churchyard. Under the patronage of William Bretton (<i>c</i>.1476&#150;1526), an important merchant of the staple of Calais, who assisted them with money, they worked in partnership for a few years, having books printed for them both in the Low Countries and in France, and Pelgrim is recorded as importing several shipments of books in 1506&#150;7. After 1508, when they had issued seven books, Pelgrim's name no longer appears in connection with the business, though Jacobi still continued at work. About 1513 the latter moved to Oxford, and opened a shop there under his old sign of the Trinity, but died in the following year. William Bretton, as a creditor, applied for letters of administration, and was represented at Oxford by his agent, Joyce Pelgrim.<br>
<br>In 1518&#150;19 Pelgrim brought two chancery suits, the first against John Petyt, bookseller. He was living in the parish of St Faith under St Paul's Cathedral, when he was assessed for the subsidy of 1523 at &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. The date of his death is not known. His will was proved in 1526, at which time he was described as of the parish of St Foster Vedast.<br>
