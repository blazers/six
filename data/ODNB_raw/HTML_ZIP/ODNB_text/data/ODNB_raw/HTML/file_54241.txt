<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keith family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;<em>c.</em>1530), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, may have taken its surname from the lands of Keith in eastern Lothian. From the end of the twelfth century its members held the hereditary office of marischal of Scotland, which entailed responsibility for the service and victualling arrangements in the king's hall. Some judicial function seems also to have fallen to the marischal, whose court dispensed immediate justice during wartime, and he shared some ceremonial duties with the constable, including the organization of tournaments and trial by battle.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15269"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Keith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1343/4)<span class="occ"></span> succeeded to the lands and office of marischal in 1293. He was appointed warden of the forest of Selkirk in August 1299, and in the same year he joined in the raid into that forest, acting in the interests of the guardians of Scotland against the English. In 1300 Keith was captured during a skirmish in Galloway, and he submitted to Edward I in 1303, receiving the office of sheriff of Aberdeen in 1304. In 1305 he was one of ten Scots chosen to represent Scotland in the English parliament held by Edward I at Westminster, and on 26 October 1305 Edward I appointed him one of four deputy wardens of Scotland, with the office of justiciar north of Forth. Keith was ordered to aid the English against Robert Bruce in September 1307, but he had espoused King Robert's cause by Christmas 1308, and attended his first parliament at St Andrews in 1309. According to Barbour, Keith commanded the Scottish cavalry, consisting of 500 light horse, at Bannockburn, where he led a fierce charge which broke the ranks of the English archers. In the Perth parliament of 1320 Robert I rewarded the marischal with a substantial grant, consisting of the forest of Kintore and of lands in Buchan forfeited by the Comyns, while his brother, Edward Keith (who succeeded him as marischal), also received lands in Buchan. As a result, the Keiths' landed influence shifted to the north-east of Scotland.<br>
<br>Keith was a signatory to the declaration of Arbroath on 6 April 1320, and was later involved in helping the young David II to escape to France, accompanying him there in May 1334 and returning with him in June 1341, although he was back in Scotland in the interim, as his name appears frequently in the records as sheriff of Aberdeen between 1335 and 1342. He married Barbara Douglas, and had a son, John, who, however, was dead by November 1324. As a result it was Sir Robert's grandson, another Robert, who was designated the marischal's heir, although he did not survive his grandfather who appears to have died in either 1343 or 1344, when he was succeeded by his brother, <a name="cosubject_54236"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Keith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1346)<span class="occ"></span>. The latter had married Isabella Sinton, thereby acquiring the lands of Sinton, before July 1305, and held the office of sheriff of Selkirk in 1328, while in 1341 he was named as one of the jurors in an inquisition held at Aberdeen before his elder brother. Sir Edward's death at the battle of Nevilles Cross, on 17 October 1346, is recorded by the English chronicler Henry Knighton, and also by Fordun.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15275"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Keith</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1407)<span class="occ"></span>, Sir Edward's eldest son and heir, is recorded as marischal in 1354. He was named as one of the commissioners negotiating for the release of David II in 1357 and travelled to England on the king's business in 1358. On 5 June that year he witnessed a charter of King David's at Edinburgh. Keith was present at the coronation of Robert II at Scone in 1371, and was one of the signatories to the second <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> in 1373. In August 1390 Keith was a witness, as both marischal and a significant member of the north-eastern nobility, to Earl Alexander of Buchan's conditional release from the excommunication which he had incurred for his attacks on Elgin and Forres earlier that year.<br>
<br>Keith acquired the barony and castle of Dunnottar in Kincardineshire, probably at the time of his marriage (which had taken place by 1359) to Margaret Fraser, daughter and heir of John Fraser and Mary Stewart, sister of Robert I. Dunnottar had been owned by William, fifth earl of Sutherland; Keith and Margaret subsequently granted it to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54269/', "Sir William Lindsay")</script> of the Byres [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54268/', "Lindsay family of the Byres")</script>], probably as part of their daughter Christian's dowry when she married Lindsay before 27 December 1375. On 8 March 1392 Keith and Margaret agreed with Lindsay to exchange the lands of Pittendreich and West Markinch for Dunnottar, which became thereafter the Keith family's principal seat. However, Keith's construction of a tower on the rocky promontory led Walter Trail, bishop of St Andrews, to excommunicate him on the grounds that he had encroached upon consecrated ground, previously occupied by a parish church, even though this had been moved elsewhere by the end of the fourteenth century. Keith protested that his tower at Dunnottar was necessary for securing the safety of his people and possessions, in view of the tribulations and hostility faced by him at the time, and that his use of Dunnottar was in no way harmful either to the new church or to its rector. His excommunication was rescinded on 14 June 1395 by a papal bull issued by the Avignon pope Benedict XIII.<br>
<br>The tribulations alluded to by Keith involved a conflict between Sir James Lindsay and Robert Keith, son of the marischal, which caused considerable disruption in the north-east at this time; Wyntoun describes a battle fought at Bourtrie in the Garioch in 1395, when Lindsay, leading a force of 400 men, sought to rescue his wife, besieged in Fyvie Castle by her nephew, Robert Keith. Keith's force was defeated, but the local feuding had national repercussions, as both men had close associations with rival factions in the royal household&#151;Keith with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26502/', "Robert Stewart, earl of Fife, later duke of Albany")</script>, who had married, as his second wife, William Keith's daughter Muriel and Lindsay with Fife's nephew, John Stewart, earl of Carrick, later King Robert III. When the council ordained in 1399 that Robert III's eldest son, David, duke of Rothesay, was to govern with the advice of twenty-one wise councillors, the composition of the council represented a distinct bias towards those with northern interests and connections with the duke of Albany. The choice of William Keith, although a reasonable one by virtue of his marischal's office, certainly demonstrated this bias. On 2 May 1407 Keith granted a charter for the lands of Aboyne, and probably died soon afterwards.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54239"></a><span class="headword">Robert Keith</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1430)<span class="occ"></span> had succeeded his father before 1410. One of the commissioners chosen to treat for the release of James I in 1424, he was sent as a hostage for the king's ransom on 28 March, his estate being valued at 800 merks. He was in the hands of John Langton, warden of the castle of York, on 16 June 1425, when he was given leave to return to Scotland until the following Martinmas. He died before 20 July 1430.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54240"></a><span class="headword">William Keith</span>, first Earl Marischal  (<em>b. </em>after 1425, <em>d.</em> 1483)<span class="occ"></span>, had succeeded his father by 20 July 1430, when he witnessed a charter as marischal. The genealogy of the fifteenth-century Keiths has suffered confusion in the past as a result of the measures which William Keith took to safeguard the descent of the family's lands. In 1442 he granted all his lands to his son Robert, but when Robert died in 1446, the lands reverted to William. The latter was created a lord of parliament, probably before 10 April 1450, and was styled William, Lord Keith, in charters granted by James II on 6 July 1451. He was one of the guarantors of the truce with England in 1457, and his elevation to an earldom, with a title&#151;that of Earl Marischal&#151;which derived from his hereditary judicial office rather than his estates, occurred between 20 March and 4 July 1458. This elevation, like that of the constable, William Hay, to the earldom of Erroll, gave increased status to a family with a convincing pedigree of loyal support for the crown, without this entailing any significant alienation of crown resources. Keith appears on a number of parliamentary sederunt lists during the reign of James III, but died in 1483. He had married Marjorie, daughter of Alexander Fraser.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54241"></a><span class="headword">William Keith</span>, second Earl Marischal  (<em>d.</em> 1526/7)<span class="occ"></span>, is recorded as sitting in parliament, as master of Keith, on 18 March 1482, and he spoke for his father to the lords auditors on 10 December 1482. He was styled Earl Marischal following the death of his father in 1483, and was a loyal supporter of James III, aiding the king in raising an army in 1488. The Marischal was with James III at Aberdeen in April 1488, and was one of the six royal commissioners involved in drawing up the Aberdeen articles, proposals for a settlement between King James and his opponents, but the king's repudiation of them may have disappointed him sufficiently to keep him from accompanying James back south in May. He was one of the king's representatives chosen to treat with the rebels after the confrontation at Blackness, but following the death of James III at Sauchieburn, on 11 June 1488, he seems to have withdrawn temporarily from political involvement.<br>
<br>The Earl Marischal was absent from the coronation of James IV at Scone on 24 June 1488, although he was in parliament on 6 October. His commitment to the new regime was, at best, lukewarm, and he was not elected to the lords of the articles, although he was permitted to sit with Bishop Elphinstone of Aberdeen among the lords auditors. Discontent with the government resulted early in 1489 in an uprising led by the earl of Lennox and Lord Lyle in the south of Scotland, and when George Gordon, master of Huntly, and Alexander, Lord Forbes, rebelled in the north, the Marischal joined forces with them. In September 1489 Keith and the master of Huntly swept south through Angus, causing great damage, but on 11 October the Marischal was on the losing side at the encounter at the field of the Moss, although he did not remain long in disgrace, as he was chosen to serve on the new privy council in the parliament held in February 1490.<br>
<br>In April 1502 the Earl Marischal received one of the letters sent by James IV requesting support for King Hans of Denmark against a Swedish rising, and in 1504 he was made one of the commanders of the forces which took part in James IV's highland campaigns. On 15 October 1504 the Marischal entertained James IV at Dunnottar, and he attended the parliament held in Edinburgh in 1510. Following the battle of Flodden, the Earl Marischal was one of those given custody of the young King James V during the governorship of John Stewart, duke of Albany, when the latter was absent in France between 1517 and 1520. In recompense for substantial sums advanced to the treasury, Albany granted the Marischal the ward of the heiress of Inverugie; and on 24 July 1527, after he had come of age, James V confirmed the ward to the second earl's grandson. William Keith had married Elizabeth Gordon, third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11033/', "George Gordon, second earl of Huntly")</script>, on 11 January 1482, so linking two important north-eastern noble families. He died before 2 May 1527, and was succeeded by his grandson, another William.<br>
