<span class="headword">Brodie,  Peter Bellinger</span>  (1815&#150;1897), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and geologist</span>, was born on 27 January 1815 at 49 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, the first child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3488/', "Peter Bellinger Brodie (1778&#150;1854)")</script>, barrister, and his first wife, Elizabeth Mary (<i>d</i>. 1823), daughter of Sutton Thomas Wood, agriculturist, of Oxford. Early interested in natural history, Brodie regularly attended meetings of the Geological Society of London in Somerset House, enjoying &#145;the many intellectual combats between the geological giants of those days&#146;  (Brodie, <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span>, 1887, 33). He was a frequent visitor at the Royal College of Surgeons, with which his uncle, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, was closely connected. William Clift, curator of its museum, proposed Brodie as fellow of the Geological Society of London; he was elected on 23 January 1834. In the same year he was admitted pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where his interest in geology continued alongside his degree studies. He attended lectures in geology by Adam Sedgwick (1785&#150;1873), accompanied him on field excursions, and assisted him in his museum. Sedgwick remained his friend and mentor, and encouraged him to continue his research. He was awarded his BA degree in 1838 and MA in 1842.<br>
<br>Brodie was ordained deacon at Salisbury Cathedral on 23 December 1838 and ordained priest on 22 December the following year. He was elected curate to the Revd Francis Baker (1773&#150;1840), rector of Wylye, Wiltshire, in 1838, and between 1840 and 1853 he worked in Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, and Warwickshire. His final move was to Rowington, Warwickshire, in 1853, when he was instituted vicar of St Lawrence's Church.<br>
<br>Brodie performed his clerical duties conscientiously. He raised funds for a new school in Rowington, for a major restoration of the church, and for the building of a mission chapel in an outlying hamlet. Probably on 1 July 1841 he married Isabella Octavia (1821&#150;1896), daughter of the Revd Francis Baker; they had one daughter and five sons. Isabella died on 17 November 1896, and a stained-glass window in Rowington church was dedicated to her by the Worcestershire Diocesan Girls' Friendly Society, for whom she was a founder worker.<br>
<br>Wherever he worked and lived Brodie continued his geological researches. His work was acknowledged by many leading geologists, not only in their publications but also by the numerous species which they named for him. He published over a hundred papers, and his book <span class="italic">The Fossil Insects of the Secondary Rocks of England</span> (1845) was the first treatise on this subject. In 1887 he was awarded the Murchison medal by the Geological Society of London. In 1853 he became a member of the thriving Warwickshire Natural History and Archaeological Society and a year later he founded its field club. He was active in every aspect of the society's work&#151;leading field trips, writing papers, serving on committees, and donating hundreds of fossils to the museum.<br>
<br>Brodie was described as a genial man who infected people with his enthusiasm and energy. His parishioners held him in high regard and affection, and they dedicated two memorial stained-glass windows to him in Rowington church. He died at home on 1 November 1897, and was buried alongside his wife and two of his sons in Rowington churchyard on 5 November. In a letter to the Warwickshire Natural History Society, after Brodie's death, Charles Lapworth (1842&#150;1920) wrote:<blockquote>we of the younger generation of geologists look up to Mr Brodie as one of the fathers of our science &hellip; not only does palaeontological geology owe a deep debt of gratitude to Mr Brodie, but stratigraphical geologists have cause to be equally grateful. (Lapworth, <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span>, 13&#150;14)</blockquote>Specimens from his huge fossil collection&#151;at one time he had about 25,000 specimens&#151;are to be found in museums throughout the country. After his death large numbers of specimens were sold to the British Museum, and to the University of Vienna.<br>
