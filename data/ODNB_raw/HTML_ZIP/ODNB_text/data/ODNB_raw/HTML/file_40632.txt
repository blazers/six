<span class="headword">Cavanagh,  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1819), <span class="occ">fives player</span>, was born in Ireland but moved to London and earned his living as a house painter. Ireland was the home of handball, the game from which fives originates; it was established in England by the mid-eighteenth century as a working-class sport played for wagers or rewards. According to William Hazlitt, his sole memorialist, Cavanagh was incomparably the most skilful player of his time: &#145;His eye was certain, his hand fatal, his presence of mind complete&#146;  (Hazlitt, &#145;Death&#146;, 94). His service was prodigious: in a match against two top-class English players, Woodward and Meredith, he once scored twenty-seven successive aces. On court he was remarkable for his coolness and economy of effort. In his <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> Hazlitt calls him &#145;the best <i>up-hill</i> player in the world&#146;  (Hazlitt, &#145;Indian jugglers&#146;, 87) because of his capacity to recover from a position of disadvantage. A peculiarity of his style of play was that he never volleyed the ball, but he was unerring on the half-volley.<br>
<br>Cavanagh lived in Buckbridge Street (now part of New Oxford Street) in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, then a predominantly Irish community. He usually played at the fives court in St Martin's Street, Leicester Fields, where crowds would pay to watch him, or at the Copenhagen House, a public house in Islington. Hazlitt records one occasion when Cavanagh went, smartly dressed, to another tavern, the Rosemary Branch at Peckham, merely &#145;for an afternoon's pleasure&#146;, but was persuaded by a stranger to play for a wager of half a crown and a bottle of cider. Cavanagh won eleven games in a row, but in the middle of the twelfth, while the other player was leading, his identity was revealed by chance; at this point his opponent refused to go on, saying &#145;What! have I been breaking my heart all this time to beat Cavanagh?&#146; Cavanagh, repeating this story, swore that he played all through with his fist clenched  (Hazlitt, &#145;Death&#146;, 95).<br>
<br>Cavanagh was described by Hazlitt as &#145;a young fellow of sense, humour, and courage&#146;, and portrayed as a zealous Roman Catholic, open in manner and upright in character. Two or three years before his death a burst blood vessel stopped him from playing. He was recovering well until he suffered another stroke and died at home on a Friday, 5 February 1819 or earlier.<br>
