<span class="headword">Russell,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1640, <em>d.</em> 1686<span class="mult">x</span>97), <span class="occ">translator of alchemical and iatrochemical treatises</span>, prepared chemical medicines with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24345/', "William Russell (1634&#150;c.1696)")</script> who was chemist-in-ordinary to Charles II and author of <span class="italic">A Physical Treatise, Grounded, not upon Tradition, nor Phancy, but Experience</span> (1684). While there is no positive evidence to identify him with any one of the Richard Russells who matriculated from various colleges at Oxford between about 1620 and 1666, he may have been so affiliated.<br>
<br>The primary source of information on Russell's work as translator is his address to the reader included in <span class="italic">The works of Geber, the most famous Arabian prince and philosopher, faithfully Englished by Richard Russel a lover of chymistry</span> (1678, reissued 1686). In this preface, dated &#145;May 3d. 1678, <i>From my House at the</i> Star <i>in</i> New-Market <i>in</i> Wapping, <i>near the</i> Dock&#146;, Russell states that it had been his original intention to conceal his identity as Geber's translator, as he had done in four previously published translations: Oswald Croll's <span class="italic">Bazilica chymica, &amp; praxis chymiatricae, or, Royal and Practical Chymistry</span> (1670), described as his &#145;first <i>Essay</i> in that kind of <i>Learning</i>&#146;; the <span class="italic">Tyrocinium chymicum, or, Chymical essays, acquired from the fountaine of nature, and manuall experience, by John Beguinus</span> (1669); <span class="italic">The golden calf, which the world adores, and desires: &hellip; written in Latin by John Frederick Helvetius doctor and practitioner of medicine</span> (1670); and <span class="italic">Basil Valentine, his triumphant chariot of antimony, with annotations of Theodore Kirkringius, MD</span> (1678). He further notes that a volume of the works of Ramon Lull is ready for printing and that he has &#145;compleated two of [Paracelsus's] three <i>Volumes</i>, and about half the third&#146;. The translations of Lull and Paracelsus were never printed. However, even without these, Russell's published works represent an important contribution to the store of alchemical and iatrochemical translations that were appearing in the last half of the seventeenth century in response to the increasing popularity of chemical medicines and the growing number of practitioners who were not expert in Latin.<br>
<br>Russell was married but his wife's name is not known. Valuable information on his practice of iatrochemistry in association with his brother William is included in <span class="italic">Arcana philosophia, or, Chymical secrets, containing the noted and useful chymical medicines of Dr Wil. and Rich. Russel chymists &hellip; publish'd by John Headrich, philo-chymicus, and formerly operator to Dr. Richard Russel</span> (1697). Published after the deaths of the Russells and avowedly Paracelsian in orientation, Headrich's book speaks of the high regard enjoyed by the Russells, whose clients included &#145;that discerning Monarch K. <i>Charles</i> the II&#146; and other members of the court. As one who had learned the secret of the Russells' tincture through assisting in Richard's laboratory, Headrich seeks to vindicate their reputations from possible debasement resulting from circulation of counterfeit medicines following their deaths; clearly his assertion of the authenticity of his own preparations was an attempt to promote their sale. Richard Russell died at some time between 1686 and 1697. Headrich also reports that he continued to serve as laboratory operator for Russell's widow.<br>
