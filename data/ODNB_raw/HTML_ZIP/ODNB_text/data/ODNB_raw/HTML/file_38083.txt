<span class="headword">Twining,  Louisa</span>  (1820&#150;1912), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 16 November 1820 at Norfolk Street, Strand, London, the youngest of nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27909/', "Richard Twining (1772&#150;1857)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27908/', "Twining, Richard (1749&#150;1824)")</script>], tea merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1866), daughter of John Smythies, rector of All Saints, Colchester. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27907/', "Elizabeth Twining")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27914/', "William Twining")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27908/', "Twining, Richard")</script>] were her siblings. She was educated at home, mainly by her mother and sisters, and later attended lectures at the Royal Institution. She hated music, but showed considerable talent for drawing and had two books on Christian art published in the early 1850s, <span class="italic">Symbols and Emblems of Early and Medieval Christian Art</span> (1852) and <span class="italic">The Types and Figures of the Bible</span> (1854).<br>
<br>In 1853, after visiting the Strand union workhouse to see an old nurse, Twining conceived the idea of systematic visits to the workhouse by neighbourhood ladies to say prayers and converse with the inmates. She was informed that unpaid and voluntary effort was not sanctioned by the poor-law board, which viewed it as unwarrantable interference. Undeterred, and with the encouragement of her friends, she began a campaign for workhouse visiting. She believed firmly that middle-class women had a natural aptitude for helping the poor, and that they should be permitted&#151;and encouraged&#151;to do so. In 1855 she published <span class="italic">A Few Words about the Inmates of our Union Workhouses</span>. She began visiting other workhouses in London, the rest of England, and abroad. Through lectures, articles, and letters she earned a reputation as an expert on workhouses. She contributed a paper, &#145;The condition of our workhouses&#146;, the first public address on the subject, to the first congress of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS) in Birmingham (1857), and followed it up with a series of letters to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In 1858 the poor-law board relented and the Workhouse Visiting Society, with Twining as honorary secretary, was set up, affiliated to the NAPSS. The following year she gave evidence to the royal commission on education on workhouse schools, advocating industrial training for girls. In 1861 she was instrumental in setting up a home for workhouse girls sent out to service, so that they would not have to mix with women of bad character. Other homes supported by Twining were made over to the Association for Befriending Young Servants in 1878.<br>
<br>Reform of workhouse infirmaries was one of Twining's prime concerns, and at one time she considered training to be a nurse herself. The hardship and neglect suffered by the impoverished sick was confirmed by a report published by <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1866. Louisa Twining campaigned ceaselessly for the separation of the sick, the aged, and the able-bodied in workhouses. In 1879 she became secretary of the Association for Promoting Trained Nursing in Workhouse Infirmaries and Sick Asylums, which was founded to train and supply nurses and to secure the appointment of trained matrons. In 1885 she joined and promoted Florence Nightingale's scheme to send trained nurses to the homes of the urban poor, the District Nurses Movement. In 1875 women became eligible for election as poor-law guardians. Louisa Twining was chief financial supporter of the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as Poor Law Guardians and subsequently chairwoman. She was a guardian herself in Kensington (1884&#150;90) and Tunbridge Wells (1893&#150;6), where she lived after retirement.<br>
<br>Workhouses were not Twining's only philanthropic interest. She taught classes for women in 1850 at the Working Men's College, assisted at a night school for boys, and was an adviser to the first woman inspector of pauper schools in 1873. With Angela Burdett-Coutts she established a house for art students in 1879. By 1895 she had attained the opening up of Lincoln's Inn Fields to the poor after years of campaigning. She pressed for prison reform and helped set up charitable houses for elderly, epileptic, and incurable women, to keep them out of the workhouse. She also helped set up a convalescent home for patients from the East End after the cholera epidemic of 1867. She established the need for, and secured, female matrons for London police courts and stations. She was involved in many church activities in London and abroad. A firm advocate of temperance, she believed that drink was the cause of much of the crime, vice, and misery of the poor. She was a strong supporter of women's participation in public affairs, believing that men and women should work together as equals. In 1904 she was president of the Women's Local Government Society. She was also a member of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. The presentation of an illuminated address to her in 1904 acknowledged her lifelong work in raising the whole standard of poor-law administration and in reducing prejudice against women in local government. Louisa Twining died, unmarried, at 68 Lansdowne Road, Kensington, London, on 25 September 1912, and was buried on 30 September at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
