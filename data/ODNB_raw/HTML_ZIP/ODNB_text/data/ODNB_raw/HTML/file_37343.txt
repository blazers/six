<span class="headword">Davies,  David</span>  (1818&#150;1890), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born at Drain-Tewion, Llandinam, Montgomeryshire, on 18 December 1818, the eldest of the nine children of David Davies (<i>d</i>. 1846), farmer and timber sawyer, and his wife, Elizabeth (probably <i>n&eacute;e</i> Felix). He left the village school at the age of eleven, and helped his father in farming and sawing timber; in later life he sometimes boasted that he was always &#145;top sawyer&#146;. When his father died in 1846 he had to support the family, but his career took a dramatic new turn when he was asked to undertake a contract to build a bridge over the River Severn near his home. He showed talent as both engineer and entrepreneur, and other bridges and roads followed. He then turned to building railways. In 1855 he built the first section of the Llanidloes&#150;Newtown line, and later extended his operations all over Wales. By the early 1860s he had supplied much of mid-Wales with a network of railway lines, many of which he built in partnership with Thomas Savin, with whom he later fell out. In 1862 he travelled to the island of Sardinia to advise on developing the railway system there.<br>
<br>He embarked on a new career in 1864 when he took a lease of mineral property between Tonpentre and Treorci in the upper Rhondda valley, not hitherto a coal-producing area. After two years of anxiety for Davies, one of the finest seams of steam coal in the world was struck in the Maendy pit, Cwmparc, and the Ocean Collieries Company was set up in 1867 with an authorized capital of &pound;240,000; new pits were later sunk at Dare (1870) and Bwllfa (1877). By 1900 the Ocean company had four collieries producing more than 1.5 million tons of coal annually, and many other pits had also been profitably established. In 1887 Davies set up a limited liability company, the Ocean Coal Company, with a nominal capital of &pound;536,000. The Rhondda valleys were now a booming industrial area, Davies was a millionaire, and Ocean stood second only to Powell Duffryn as a mass producer of quality Welsh steam coal.<br>
<br>Davies's rivalry with the Bute estate, which controlled Cardiff docks and the Taff Vale railway that served it, led him into another dramatic new venture&#151;the building of new docks at Barry, 10 miles to the west of Cardiff&#151;as a rival entrep&ocirc;t for Rhondda coal. After a fierce struggle, a private act of parliament was passed in 1884, and the Barry docks came into being a year later. They grew rapidly and by 1913 Barry had outstripped even Cardiff as the major coal-exporting port in the world.<br>
<br>A devout Calvinistic Methodist and a strict advocate of temperance, Davies became a patron of nonconformist and other charitable and educational causes. He backed the movement for Welsh higher education and became a governor of the newly formed University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, founded in 1872. In 1875 Davies became treasurer of the college and fulfilled this role until 1886. He also took a close interest in Liberal politics. He stood unsuccessfully for Cardigan district against a local whiggish landowner, Sir Thomas Lloyd, in 1865, but in 1874 won the seat and was returned unopposed in 1880. He was elected for Cardiganshire in 1885, but he opposed the first <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span> introduced by W. E. Gladstone in June 1886. At the resulting general election he was defeated by nine votes by a fellow Liberal, Bowen Rowlands, who backed Irish home rule. He was elected to the first Montgomeryshire county council in 1889.<br>
<br>Davies was a rugged, frugal, self-made capitalist, a relentless business competitor, who remained close to his chapel roots. Severely puritanical and sabbatarian in outlook, he also had a great fund of homely anecdotes about village mores, in both Welsh and English. He was a public-spirited philanthropist, and was perhaps the most influential Welshman of his time.<br>
<br>In 1851 Davies married Margaret Jones of Llanfair Caereinion, the daughter of Edward Jones, a local farmer. They had one son, Edward, who was to die in 1898. David Davies died on 20 July 1890 in Llandinam, and was buried there on 24 July. His grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32737/', "David Davies")</script>, became first Baron Davies.<br>
