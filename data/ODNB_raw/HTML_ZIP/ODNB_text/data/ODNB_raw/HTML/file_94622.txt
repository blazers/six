</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scarman,  Leslie George</span>, Baron Scarman  (1911&#150;2004), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at 17 Beechcroft Mansions, Hopton Road, Streatham, London, on 29 July 1911, the son of George Charles Scarman (<i>d</i>. 1954), a Lloyd's underwriter, and his Scottish wife, Ida Irene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Schofield. His mother was in his words a &#145;fierce and lovely&#146; woman to whom he later attributed the streak of conservatism with which he was sometimes reproached  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 29 July 1991). Certainly his early years gave little sign of the radicalism which came to be associated with him, though late in life he admitted having been a schoolboy Liberal, and added: &#145;Maybe I still am&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 10 Dec 2004). Open scholarships took him to Radley College (where he also won the James and Gibbs scholarships) and on to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he took a first in classical moderations in 1932 and another first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1934. From Oxford he went as a Harmsworth scholar to the Middle Temple to read for the bar, to which he was called in 1936.<h2>
<a name="Warservicethebarandmarriage"></a>War service, the bar, and marriage</h2>The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 rescued Scarman, as it did many of his generation, from the tedium of waiting for briefs which were slow to come. Having joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and initially got stuck behind a desk in Abingdon, he eventually found himself in north Africa, Sicily, Italy, and northern Europe on the staff of Sir Arthur Tedder, the commander-in-chief of Mediterranean air forces. He was demobilized in 1945 with the rank of wing commander. Although he saw no fighting he was awarded the Order of Battle Merit of the USSR in 1945, and an OBE in 1944, the latter possibly in recognition of the skills which he had deployed earlier in the war to prevent Tedder's assignment to courts martial. Tedder, in retirement, recalled Scarman as &#145;the most intelligent and congenial civilian staff member I ever had&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 16 Dec 2004). Scarman was present when General Jodl surrendered to Tedder and Eisenhower at Rheims, and it may be that his later espousal of entrenched human rights owed something to his wartime experience. He maintained his interest in the RAF after demobilization, and was later Tedder's successor as president of the RAF servicemen's Malcolm clubs.<br>
<br>In the company of hundreds of other war veterans, many of them more scarred than he was, Scarman in 1945 returned to the bar. Although he claimed that he was by nature simply a hard worker who made up in industry what he lacked in talent, he rapidly displayed both qualities. Where others were giving up and moving on, he began to assemble a varied common-law practice, becoming sought after as a particularly skilled cross-examiner. On 5 September 1947 he married Ruth Clement Page-Jenkson. Two years younger than him, she was the daughter of Clement Wright, a member of the Indian Civil Service, and the former wife of Cuthbert Gordon Stowell, from whom she had obtained a divorce; she had changed her name to Page-Jenkson by deed poll. She and Scarman adopted a son, John Clement (<i>b</i>. 1946).<br>
<br>As a barrister in these early post-war years Scarman began to display some of the intellectual courage which was eventually to mark him out. Arguing a <span class="roman">Rent Acts</span> case before a judge who was anxious to find for him, he was offered a point of law that would have won him the case but which he knew to be bad. Scarman refused to take it. Such adherence to principle did not earn universal admiration: some of his contemporaries regarded him as sanctimonious. The head of his chambers, Melford Stevenson, once remarked: &#145;Leslie helps solicitors on with their coats like Father D'Arcy elevating the host&#146;, a comment as astute as it was vitriolic  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 Dec 2004). It was typical of Scarman that he would not leave it to his clerk to help a solicitor on with his coat after a conference, and typical of the bar to notice such a breach of its class barriers. But it was also true that Scarman's long, gangling frame, his slight stoop, and his gravely courteous mien gave him the mildly unctuous manner that the head of his chambers had noted.<h2>
<a name="Amodeljudge"></a>A model judge</h2>After only four years in silk, which he had taken in 1957, Scarman was knighted and elevated to the bench of the eclectically titled Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court in 1961. He was almost at once given the highly complex lawsuit over the multi-million pound Fuld estate to try. The writer Sybille Bedford observed him there:<blockquote>In ambles the lanky&#151;gracefully lanky&#151;figure of a youthful judge &hellip; a most unusual face: enormous eyes deep-set between high cheek-bones and a jutting skull, a pale face, a hollow face with skin stretched taut, and yet the mouth is full and there show dimples in the sunken cheeks; it is an ascetic's face lit by charm, given the lie by a cherub's smile &hellip; it is impossible to imagine him bullying anyone. Yet, he is held in respect: there is no doubt that authority flows from him. (Bedford, 105, 108)</blockquote>It was as such a judge, first in the High Court, then from 1973 in the Court of Appeal, and from 1977 as a lord of appeal in ordinary, with the title of Baron Scarman, of Quatt, in the county of Salop, that Scarman stood out among his contemporaries. (It had been expected that he would succeed Lord Denning at the head of the Court of Appeal as master of the rolls, but Denning would not retire and Scarman was instead promoted to the Lords.) He was widely regarded as a model judge: courteous, learned, businesslike, humane; capable of being firm or generous as the case required in both the civil and criminal jurisdictions. He stood out, too, as a scholarly exponent of the common law. His judgments, always lean and elegant, include some seminal expositions&#151;of the law of contempt of court; working out a symmetry between the integrity of the legal process and the right of free speech and comment; and of the developing area of public law in which the needs of the state and the entitlements of the individual were during Scarman's lifetime being rebalanced.<br>
<br>To have achieved even this much distinction in an era dominated by two other great judicial figures, Lord Diplock and Lord Denning, was no mean feat; but Scarman, who yielded nothing to either of them in learning, had as much acuity as Diplock without his acerbity, and as sharp a sense of policy as Denning without his partiality. During one of Scarman's contempt of court cases counsel at the bar of the house cited a passage from Lord Shaw's speech in <i>Scott v. Scott</i> (1913) on the importance of open justice. As the barrister closed the volume, Scarman said: &#145;You've just closed the book on one of the finest pieces of prose in the whole of the law reports. You should go on.&#146; The passage, which Scarman must have known by heart, runs: &#145;To remit the maintenance of constitutional right to the region of judicial discretion is to shift the foundations of freedom from the rock to the sand&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 Dec 2004). It was to be a keynote of Scarman's own work.<h2>
<a name="TheLawCommissionandpublicinquiries"></a>The Law Commission and public inquiries</h2>In 1965 Lord Gardiner, lord chancellor in the Labour government, set up Britain's first permanent law commission, introducing a novel depth of research and breadth of policy into the process of law reform in England and Wales. Scarman, still in judicial office, accepted the chairmanship, and for seven years led a team of able and opinionated commissioners, listening to every point of view, taking great care not to impose his own, and showing a gift not only for strategic thinking but for detailed management. His ambition, no less real for being unrealizable, was to slim down the overweight statute book and to replace its bulk with simplified and, where possible, codified measures. The commission's work could have only as much effect as ministers and parliament were prepared to accord to it. But, thanks to Gardiner's support, the Law Commission in Scarman's years of office produced twenty-seven reports containing draft bills, every one of which reached the statute book&#151;a record looked back upon by his successors with envy. Among the fruits were the radical reforms contained in the <span class="roman">Divorce Reform Act</span> (1969) and the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act</span> (1970).<br>
<br>In these years the first chairman of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Michael Kirby, found Scarman, as well as being a good listener, to be &#145;sharp in analysis, brimming over with ideas, sweet in disposition, egalitarian in relationships, persuasive in advocacy and resolute in action. He became the example and beacon for institutional law reformers everywhere&#146;  (Kirby). These, too, were the qualities that earned Scarman accolades as the chairman of a series of public inquiries instituted by government between 1969, when he was given the sensitive task of reporting on the recent disturbances in Northern Ireland, and 1981, when he was asked to report on the riots in Brixton. In these, and in his intervening inquiries&#151;into the Red Lion Square disturbances (1975) and the Grunwick trade dispute (1977)&#151;Scarman displayed what were by now his trademark qualities of approachability, open-mindedness, and procedural firmness. He initiated the inquiry into the Red Lion Square disorders with a statement that became a classic source of tone and content for later inquiries:<blockquote>This is an inquiry, not a piece of litigation &hellip; It is I and I alone who will decide what witnesses are to be called &hellip; I propose within limits to allow cross-examination of witnesses to the extent that I think it helpful to the forwarding of the inquiry, but no further. (Sedley, 470)</blockquote>Scarman was clear, and made it clear to government, that in these extra-judicial roles he remained a judge, adaptable to the requirements of the job but not amenable to any political directions or pressure. He sharply and successfully opposed, as an invasion of judicial independence, a proposal to give the Law Commission a statutory duty to &#145;assist&#146; government. In this way, repeatedly stationed on the boundaries between the divided functions of the state, Scarman was able to come to the aid of both the legislature and the executive without forfeiting his judicial credentials. Indeed what made him attractive to government and the public were the judicial qualities he brought to his stewardship of the Law Commission and to his public inquiries. They eventually earned him the liking and respect of many members of the black community who had initially seen the setting up of the Brixton inquiry as a whitewash, and both there and in Northern Ireland his unconcern for personal security and willingness to talk to anyone who approached him made him many friends. He later described as &#145;traumatic&#146; the realization that many of the people of the six counties were effectively without rights.<br>
<br>Scarman's conduct of the Brixton inquiry was particularly influential. While praising the police for their conduct on the night of the riots, he acknowledged that &#145;racial disadvantage&#146; was &#145;a fact of current British life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Nov 1981), and called both for government action to tackle the disproportionately high level of unemployment among young black men and for a new emphasis on community policing to restore trust between the black community and the police. Even so, Scarman never rocked the political boat. His rejection of the notion of institutional racism, and his conclusion that racists in the Metropolitan Police represented only a few &#145;bad apples&#146; in the barrel, fell a long way short of what Sir William Macpherson's inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence was later to conclude.<h2>
<a name="Radicalismperceivedandreal"></a>Radicalism, perceived and real</h2>Although as a judge Scarman's decisions were by no means always socially liberal or politically left of centre, neither those who knew Scarman nor Scarman himself would have expected them to be. But the reputation that came to surround him, and for which he himself was in large part consciously responsible, was such that his admirers were shocked when in 1979 he cast his vote with the other law lords in favour of upholding the conviction of the editor of <span class="italic">Gay News</span>, Denis Lemon, for the much-criticized common-law offence of blasphemy. Although in the case about trade-union recognition at GCHQ, Cheltenham, in 1985 he set out a seminal statement of the modern amenability of the royal prerogative to judicial review, he accepted the government's last-minute argument that once national security was raised the courts were shut out. In fact Scarman very rarely dissented. He made up the bare majority in 1986 that rejected Victoria Gillick's attempt to prevent doctors prescribing contraceptives for girls under the age of sixteen, closing the door on the notion that children were without rights. But he joined the rest of the Lords' appellate committee in striking down the Greater London council's &#145;fares fair&#146; policy in 1981. It was the last of these cases that did most to spoil Scarman's liberal credentials. Although it ostensibly turned upon a dry issue of statutory construction, everybody knew that the case was a political battle between Conservative-controlled outlying boroughs with already high rates and an addiction to private transport and a Labour-dominated regional administration that wanted the ratepayers to subsidize cheap public transport that would clear the roads of unneeded traffic. The leader of the Greater London council, Ken Livingstone, later called Scarman &#145;a two-faced old hypocrite&#146; for his role in the decision. &#145;I'm not interested&#146;, he said, &#145;in people who get wonderfully progressive after they retire. He had his chance when he had power; he didn't take it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 29 July 1991).<br>
<br>Scarman would not have recognized any judicial decision that sacrificed legality to politics, or even to policy; but he did become, in Livingstone's phrase, wonderfully progressive after he retired. Indeed he had moved markedly in that direction while still in judicial office. While chairing the Law Commission he had defied the Kilmuir rules, which, until abandoned by a later lord chancellor, Lord Mackay, discouraged judges from speaking in public on matters of policy. Beginning with a series of factual broadcasts on the work of the Law Commission, he went on to take part in Michael Zander's Third Programme discussion series, <span class="italic">What's Wrong with the Law?</span> Later he followed his 1974 Hamlyn lectures with a four-part discussion on Radio 3 with Lord Denning (the latter's first but far from last broadcast); and in 1986 he debated Lord McCluskey's Reith lectures on radio with another lord chancellor, Lord Hailsham.<br>
<br>Although explicitly rejecting the concept of institutional racism in his Brixton report, Scarman had nevertheless recognized the toxic effects of racial discrimination and disadvantage in modern Britain, and he used his seat in the House of Lords to introduce the amendment to the <span class="roman">Police and Criminal Evidence Bill</span> (1984), which made racial discrimination by police officers a disciplinary offence. Then in 1985, just before he retired from the bench, he introduced into the Lords a bill to incorporate the European convention on human rights into the United Kingdom's domestic law. His fellow peers passed it, but it was denied parliamentary time in the Commons and fell. It was another thirteen years before a newly elected Labour government put the European convention on the statute book. Scarman's bill, however, was no flash in the pan. In his 1974 Hamlyn lectures, published as <span class="italic">English Law: the New Dimension</span> (1975), he had presented a full and cogent case, all the more arresting as time went by for the prescience of its arguments, for giving the powerless direct access to rights which the United Kingdom was anxious for other peoples to have but less keen to incorporate into legislation at home. The lectures were a landmark in strategic thinking about the law.<br>
<br>Scarman was made an honorary fellow of his old college, Brasenose, in 1966, and later received five other honorary fellowships and fourteen honorary degrees. From 1970 to 1986 he was chairman of the court of the University of London, and from 1977 to 1989 chancellor of Warwick University. From 1973 to 1976 he chaired the Council of Legal Education and then from 1976 to 1979 the senate of the inns of court and the bar. He was a member of the Arts Council from 1968 to 1970 and 1972 to 1973, and vice-chairman of English National Opera from 1976 to 1981.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandcharacter"></a>Retirement and character</h2>In retirement Scarman kept busy as president of the British Institute of Human Rights, the Constitutional Reform Centre, and the Citizen Action Compensation Campaign, and patron of such bodies as the constitutional reform group Charter 88 and the Public Law Project. A trust set up by Charter 88 and chaired by him for a number of years was renamed the Scarman Trust in recognition of his pioneering inquiry reports on Northern Ireland and Brixton. The trust survived him and grew, making monetary awards backed by professional advice and support to stimulate social enterprise in local communities.<br>
<br>Such largely&#151;though by no means wholly&#151;honorific positions were perhaps no more than was to be expected of such a distinguished figure; but what was unexpected was Scarman's championship, in retirement, of a series of unpopular causes. He took up the cases of the Birmingham six and the Guildford four (Irishmen gaoled on questionable evidence for alleged terrorist activities), and the Tottenham Three (young black men convicted of the murder of a policeman during the Broadwater Farm riots in 1985), calling for an overhaul of the mechanism, then entirely a matter for the home secretary's discretion, for re-examining possible miscarriages of justice. As a judge Scarman had been responsible for quashing the three convictions in the <i>Confait case</i>, a historic miscarriage of justice that lay behind the eventual introduction of tape-recording of police interviews. Scarman had satisfied himself in each case that something had gone seriously wrong, and the campaigns were all ultimately successful. In the same spirit he campaigned for a statutory right of access to official information and the repeal of the widely disliked section 2 of the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span>. The creation, within his lifetime, of the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the passing of a <span class="roman">Freedom of Information Act</span> illustrated yet again Scarman's capacity for wisdom before the event.<br>
<br>A tireless worker who often rose to work before dawn, a near-recluse who would not attend dinners except in his own inn of court, an admitted friend of change but an avowed enemy of disjunction, Scarman was someone whose private asceticism seemed incompatible with his outgoing public persona and readiness to take on challenge and controversy. But if one adds the fact that as a young man he played the trombone, and that in later years he became passionate about opera, one starts to see the cultured man who on one occasion gently interrupted a young barrister appearing before him who had casually attributed to Candide the view that all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds, and said: &#145;I think you'll find it was Dr Pangloss&#146;  (private information). Having lived latterly in Alpha Road, Birchington, Kent, he died on 8 December 2004 at Eaton Lodge nursing home, 62 Westgate Bay Avenue, Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, of cancer of the bladder and bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Ruth, and their adopted son. A memorial service was held at the Temple Church on 16 February 2005.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>One of the long-term processes which the twentieth century witnessed in the legal system of England and Wales was the transition from the common-law-dominated system of the nineteenth century to the statute-dominated system of the twenty-first. Leslie Scarman's life and work both spanned and helped to shape this historic shift. A learned and principled exponent of the common law, he presided over the endeavours of the first law commission to systematize the process of statute-law reform and became the first major legal figure to call, many years before its time, for the enactment of a bill of rights. A serving judge, he was used by government to defuse major discontents by conducting a succession of public inquiries. Scarman's life was both the orthodox legal career of his generation and a surprising breaking of the judicial mould.<br>
