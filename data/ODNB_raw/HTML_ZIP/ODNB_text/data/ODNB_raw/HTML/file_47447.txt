<span class="headword">Smithers,  Leonard Charles</span>  (1861&#150;1907), <span class="occ">publisher and antiquarian bookseller</span>, was born on 19 December 1861 at 5 Infirmary Road, Sheffield, Yorkshire, one of several children of John Smithers, a dentist, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. He was reared in Sheffield, where he graduated from Wesley College for the Law in 1884. Having been admitted solicitor of the Supreme Court of Judicature, he was employed for several years by the firm of Messrs Meredith Roberts and Mills of Sheffield. While still a law student he had married Alice Edith Oldham on 11 October 1882; they had two children, a daughter, Lena, who died at the age of two in 1891, and a son, Jack, born in August 1891.<br>
<br>Although Smithers gained his livelihood for a time as a solicitor, he was far more interested in books and art than in the legal profession. In his spare time he rummaged through the bookstalls and haunted the antiquarian bookshops of Sheffield and its environs, increasingly adept at ferreting out the odd rarity that he could afford. Books of erotica appear to have been his major interest. As his desire to pursue a career in books grew, Smithers came under the influence of the famous world traveller and diplomat Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, whose fascination with sexual customs of oriental peoples was well known. Smithers was &#145;a young solicitor with a taste for erotic literature, frankly fascinated by sexual pathology&#146;  (F. Brodie, <span class="italic">The Devil Drives: a Life of Sir Richard Burton</span>, 1967, 319). He subscribed to Burton's unexpurgated edition of <span class="italic">The Thousand Nights and a Night</span> when it first appeared in 1885&#150;6; he thereby established a correspondence with the translator of other erotic books such as the <span class="italic">Kama sutra</span> (1883) and the <span class="italic">Ananga Ranga, or, The Hindu Art of Love</span> (1873, 1885). By 1888 Smithers, with the aid of a young Sheffield printer and book dealer, Harry Sidney Nichols, had established the Erotika Biblion Society, a fictitious organization modelled on Burton's own Kama Shastra Society. Under this imprint, Smithers and Nichols issued several erotic books, one of which was Smithers's translation of the Latin text of the <span class="italic">Priapeia</span> (1888). Burton, who showed a great interest in this work, offered to add a poetic translation to Smithers's prose text, a project which was published in October 1890, after Burton's death, in a bowdlerized form demanded by Burton's widow, Lady Burton. The second of their two collaborations, the Smithers&#150;Burton translation of the <span class="italic">Carmina</span> of Catullus&#151;once again &#145;cleaned up&#146; by Isabel Burton&#151;appeared in 1894. Despite Lady Burton's insistence on editing her husband's erotic books, Smithers and Nichols were able to gain control of <span class="italic">The Thousand Nights and a Night</span>, which they brought out in attractive and unexpurgated editions in 1894&#150;5.<br>
<br>Smithers and Nichols, having established a partnership in a rare book dealership and printing business in Sheffield in the late 1880s, moved their business to London in September 1891, the rare bookshop located at 174 Wardour Street, near Oxford Street, and the printing business located nearby at 10 Dean Street, Soho. Here they continued to issue erotic books under the imprint of the Erotika Biblion Society. Uneasy about Nichols's penchant for bringing out books of hard-core pornography, Smithers severed his partnership with Nichols at the close of 1894, establishing himself in business as a rare book dealer and as a legitimate publisher in quarters above his residential flat in Effingham House, 1 Arundel Street, the Strand, in 1895. As his business prospered, towards the close of 1896, Smithers moved his shop to 4 and 5 Royal Arcade, Old Bond Street, and later to premises at 5 Old Bond Street.<br>
<br>On his own, Smithers prospered as a publisher&#151;the renowned bookman Bernard Quaritch toasting him as the &#145;cleverest&#146; publisher in London at a publishers' dinner in 1897  (O'Sullivan, 117). His love for beautifully bound and illustrated books as well as his excellent taste in book design and typography made him, in the words of one critic, &#145;the most extraordinary publisher, in some respects, of the nineties, a kind of modern Cellini, who produced some wonderfully finely printed books and was himself just as much a part of the movement as any of its numerous writers&#146;  (B. Muddiman, <span class="italic">The Men of the Nineties</span>, 1920, 41).<br>
<br>After Oscar Wilde went to prison, Smithers almost single-handedly saved the avant-garde writers and artists from extinction, providing them with both employment and encouragement. When in April 1895 John Lane of the Bodley Head succumbed to the ultimatum of his conservative, morally high-toned authors and dismissed Aubrey Beardsley as art editor of the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, Smithers came to his rescue. He launched a rival journal, <span class="italic">The Savoy</span>, appointing Arthur Symons literary editor and Beardsley chief artist. The finest aesthetic journal of the nineties, <span class="italic">The Savoy</span> included stories, essays, and poems by Symons, Ernest Dowson, Bernard Shaw, Max Beerbohm, W. B. Yeats, Edmund Gosse, Ford Madox Hueffer (Ford), Joseph Conrad, and Havelock Ellis, as well as artwork by Beardsley, Beerbohm, Joseph Pennell, Charles Conder, Charles H. Shannon, and James McNeill Whistler.<br>
<br>Smithers declared that he would &#145;publish anything that the others [London publishers] are afraid of&#146;  (O'Sullivan, 113). That audacity enabled him to bring out some of the most important books of the nineties: Symons's <span class="italic">London Nights</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">Amoris victima</span> (1897), Dowson's <span class="italic">Verses</span> (1896) and <span class="italic">Decorations: in Verse and Prose</span> (1899), as well as Beardsley's finest illustrated books, for example <span class="italic">The Lysistrata of Aristophanes</span> (1896) and Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> (1898), as well as the writings of others whom, like Beardsley, the public had erroneously associated with Wilde and treated as pariahs. As O'Sullivan later wrote, for the &#145;young poets&#146; Smithers took under his wing, he was &#145;a benediction. They would have been hard put to it to find another publisher in London&#146;  (O'Sullivan, 126). After Wilde was released from prison in 1897, Smithers dared to publish <span class="italic">The Ballad of Reading Gaol</span>, a work no other publisher would touch. There is little doubt that without Smithers the avant-garde movement of the nineties might have foundered.<br>
<br>During the later nineties Smithers was a familiar personage among the writers and artists of London, Dieppe, and Paris. He was a distinctive figure, described by Wilde as wearing ties<blockquote>delicately fastened with a diamond brooch of the impurest water&#151;or perhaps wine, as he never touches water: it goes to his head at once. His face, clean-shaven as befits a priest who serves at the altar whose God is literature, is wasted and pale&#151;not with poetry, but with poets, who, he says, have wrecked his life by insisting on publishing with him. He loves first editions, especially women: little girls are his passion. He is the most learned erotomaniac in Europe. He is also a delightful companion, and a dear fellow, very kind to me. (<span class="italic">The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde</span>, ed. M. Holland and R. Hart-Davis, 2000, 924)</blockquote>But as Smithers poured large sums of money into finely produced books such as Honor&eacute; de Balzac's <span class="italic">La fille aux yeux d'or</span> (1896), illustrated by Conder, and Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">The Rape of the Lock</span> (1896), decorated by Beardsley, he fell into financial difficulties. Partly as a result of his generosity to impecunious authors such as Wilde and Dowson, Smithers moved steadily downward towards bankruptcy, which occurred on 18 September 1900.<br>
<br>After the bankruptcy, Smithers, in order to survive as a publisher, began pirating books to which he no longer had legal rights. Having vacated his fine premises in Bond Street (as well as his palatial home at 6A Bedford Square), Smithers set up an office at 14 Clifford's Inn, where he continued to do business under various surreptitious names, such as Hampden &amp; Co. and Burton &amp; Co. Moreover, he became associated with an underground printer, Alfred Cooper, with whom he published under the imprint Wright and Jones. After Wilde's death in November 1900, Smithers and Cooper published many pirated editions of Wilde's work. In 1904, under the imprint the Mathurin Press, Smithers published a pirated edition of Wilde's <span class="italic">The Harlot's House</span> with illustrations by Althea Gyles. Also in 1904, Smithers brought out under the imprint Melmoth &amp; Co. an edition of Wilde's <span class="italic">Salome</span>.<br>
<br>During his later years, Smithers's problems were augmented by what George Sims called &#145;muscular Rheumatism&#146;  (Sims, 297), the ravages of which drove him to alcohol and narcotics abuse. Smithers died in poverty at 4 Kent House, Peterborough Road, Fulham, on 19 December 1907. He was buried in an unmarked private grave in Fulham cemetery, London, on 27 December; his net worth at the time of his death was a mere &pound;99. His wife and son survived him.<br>
