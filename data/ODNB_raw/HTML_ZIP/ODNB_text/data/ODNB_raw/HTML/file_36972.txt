<span class="headword">Wilson,  William Edward</span>  (1851&#150;1908), <span class="occ">astronomer and physicist</span>, born at Belfast on 19 July 1851, was the only son of John Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1906), of Daramona, Streete, co. Westmeath, and his wife, Frances Patience, daughter of the Revd Edward Nangle. Because of delicate health he was educated privately, and showed great interest in astronomy while still a boy. In 1870 he joined the British party under the pioneer astrophysicist William Huggins, which went to Oran in Algeria to observe the total eclipse of the sun in that year, and on his return he set up a private observatory on his father's estate at Daramona, equipped with a 12 inch refractor by Grubb.<br>
<br>In 1881 Wilson built a new observatory with a 24 inch silver on glass Cassegrain reflector, also by Grubb; in 1889 he added a physical laboratory, and in 1891&#150;2 added a clock drive and electric control to the telescope. Thus equipped, and despite the climate, Wilson took photographs of nebulae and clusters that were among the best obtained in the nineteenth century. These, and important papers, were published privately as <span class="italic">Astronomical and Physical Researches Made at Mr Wilson's Observatory, Daramona, Westmeath</span> (1900).<br>
<br>Wilson is best known for research, begun in 1884, on solar heat and the radiation from sunspots. Like E. B. Frost, who had powerful equipment at Yerkes Observatory, Chicago, Wilson wrongly concluded that sunspots were raised features, and hotter than the solar surface. But that investigation led him to remarkable pioneering work. Wilson and Philip L. Gray, a physicist from Mason College at Birmingham, in 1894 determined the solar constant (total energy radiated by the sun per second) by using one of C. V. Boys's radio-micrometers which measures energy received; they applied Stefan-Boltzmann's law of 1884 (energy output, relating surface area to effective temperature), then allowed for atmospheric absorption of one third <i>per</i> Wilson's own calculation with Arthur Alcock Rambaut in 1892. In 1901 Wilson derived the temperature of the sun to be 6590 &deg;C. Wilson also achieved a significant measurement of the decrease in radiation received from the limb.<br>
<br>In collaboration with G. F. FitzGerald, a professor of Trinity College, Dublin, and G. M. Minchin, Wilson also worked on the temperature of stars. Between 1892 and 1895 he pioneered replacing visual photometric observations of stellar magnitudes by attaching to his 9 inch refractor a photometer with a selenium cell; crystalline selenium changes its resistance when exposed to light, producing a very small linear electrical response. The response was unstable with time, and although the technique was independently conceived and developed after 1906 by Joel Stebbings at the University of Illinois, it was superseded by the photoelectric cell about 1912. Other work included an examination of the effect of great pressure on radioactive substances and an expedition to Plasencia to observe the solar eclipse of 1900. He was elected fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1875, FRS in 1896, and was made honorary DS of Dublin University in 1901.<br>
<br>Wilson had a fertile and original mind, was careful and persevering in his research, charming, and sincere. He married, on 10 November 1886, Caroline Ada, third daughter of Captain R. C. Granville of Grand Pr&eacute;, Biarritz; they had at least one son, John Granville, and two daughters. Wilson mainly lived on his estate, and was high sheriff of co. Westmeath in 1901. He died at Daramona on 6 March 1908, and was buried in the family burying-ground attached to the parish church of Streete, the village adjoining his demesne. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>In 1925 John G. Wilson offered the Daramona telescope to London University, which established the Mill Hill observatory to utilize it; in 1974 the instrument was transferred to the Liverpool Museum.<br>
