<span class="headword">Fox,  Felicity  Lane-</span>, Baroness Lane-Fox  (1918&#150;1988), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 22 June 1918 in Newton Kyme, near Tadcaster, Yorkshire, the youngest child in the family of one son and three daughters of Captain Edward Lane-Fox JP and his wife, Enid Maud Bethell, herself later appointed MBE in 1967 for work for hospitals. Both her parents came from old Yorkshire families, her mother being the daughter of Alfred James Bethell, of Rise, and her father being the younger brother of George Richard Lane-Fox, the first and last Baron Bingley, of Bramham. At the age of two, Felicity developed periostitis, which left her with a permanently weak right arm. In 1930, at the age of twelve, on a summer holiday on the Yorkshire coast at Filey, she contracted poliomyelitis in a vicious form, which left her totally paralysed. Two years passed before she was able to sit up or to hold a cup or pencil. During this period she was living at home in the family house near Wetherby. Deprived of any formal education, she acquired knowledge by her own efforts supported by her mother's wide-ranging enthusiasms. Her mother, who lived until 1986, devoted the next fifty-five years of her life to the daily care of her disabled daughter. After her mother became incapable of looking after her, she was cared for by her sister.<br>
<br>When war came in 1939, Felicity Lane-Fox took on a job with the billeting officer in Wetherby. After the end of hostilities in 1945 she went into local politics as a councillor for the Wetherby division of the West Riding county council and became chairman of the local Conservative association. Her interest in politics took her from there in 1960 to an appointment as assistant at the Conservative Research Department and in 1963 she became a member of the executive of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. Through these links with the party, she became known to Margaret Thatcher, who, on becoming prime minister, offered her in 1981 a life peerage, which she was only persuaded to accept after her mother convinced her that the House of Lords would give her a forum for speaking on behalf of the disabled. This she assiduously did during the next seven years, making her maiden speech, a fortnight after taking her seat, on the integration of disabled children into ordinary schools. She was absent from the house on only three working days during her first year as a member.<br>
<br>Felicity Lane-Fox's work for the disabled had already won her an OBE in 1976, for in spite of her own disability, and with the indefatigable help of her mother, who combined the roles of nurse, chauffeur, and counsellor, she travelled widely, spoke frequently, and carried on a large correspondence on behalf of a number of societies and projects connected with disabled people. Among these were the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre at Oxford, where she was a member of the house committee, and the national fund-raising committee of the Disablement Income Group, of which she was chair. In 1978 she became patron of the Handicapped Adventure Playground Association. To all these activities she paid full attention, regularly attending their meetings, to which she was driven in a specially adapted minicar into which she could be winched through the back window by her mother, who in spite of increasing age managed to propel her in the vehicle or on the ground with unflagging energy. For having learned to walk with the aid of a calliper and some human support, Felicity in 1966 slipped on an icy patch of roadway, broke her pelvis, and was never able to walk again.<br>
<br>After becoming a baroness Felicity Lane-Fox accepted several further appointments to societies for the disabled, in particular becoming a member of the prince of Wales's advisory group on disability and of the committee of inquiry into arts and disabled people. But the project which was closest to her heart was the Phipps Respiratory Unit Patients' Association (PRUPA). This unit, originally established in Clapham by Dr Geoffrey Spencer to provide relief and therapy for patients suffering from breathing maladies, was, thanks to her fund-raising efforts, later moved to become part of St Thomas's Hospital in Lambeth Palace Road, where it was renamed the Lane-Fox Respiratory Unit, and is a fitting memorial to her.<br>
<br>Felicity Lane-Fox leavened her arduous work for the disabled by a variety of other interests. She enjoyed watching cricket, tennis, racing, drama, and documentaries on television or listening to them on the radio, as well as a game of bridge and perhaps, most of all, social intercourse and conversation with her many friends. Her life was an example of how to overcome crippling physical infirmity and use the experience of it to alleviate the plight of fellow sufferers.<br>
<br>The fact that Felicity Lane-Fox was chair-bound, and also possessed a mane of thick brown hair, made it appear that her head was unusually large. With a high forehead, mischievous grey eyes, a classical nose, and a magnolia complexion, which never showed signs of ageing, her face gave an impression of being poised for laughter, into which it readily dissolved. She died, unmarried, in St Thomas's Hospital on 17 April 1988; a memorial service was held at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 7 June 1988.<br>
