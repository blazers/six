<span class="headword">Thom,  William</span>  (1798?&#150;1848), <span class="occ">poet and weaver</span>, was born in Aberdeen, probably on 12 March 1798. He hardly knew his father, who may have been a merchant or an architect. Run over by a nobleman's carriage at an early age, Thom was lamed for life; his widowed mother was offered compensation of 10<i>s</i>. by the occupant of the carriage. Educated only at a dame-school, Thom became an autodidact. At the School Hill Factory in Aberdeen, he worked simultaneously as a weaver and as a student, delighting especially in Scottish songs and poems. He also became adept at this time at playing the flute.<br>
<br>Thom married when he was aged about twenty, but the couple separated after only a few years. By 1837, when he briefly gave up weaving, Thom was living with Jean Whitecross, a Kirriemuir woman, with whom he had four children. A very poor man, Thom struggled to feed himself and his family by itinerant bookselling and flute playing. Jean Whitecross died in 1840, by which time the family had settled in Inverurie and Thom had returned to weaving. It was really at this point that his career as a poet began. He was already well known in his own community for songwriting, but, early in 1841, one of his poems, &#145;The Blind Boy's Pranks&#146;, was published in the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Herald</span>, and, soon after, in many other Scottish newspapers. The poem secured Thom a valuable patron, J. A. Gordon, a former English MP and laird of Knockespock. Gordon's English connections were extremely useful to Thom; he spent the summer of 1841 at his patron's house in London.<br>
<br>In 1844 Thom brought out a short-lived journal, the <span class="italic">Inverurie Gossamer</span>, and, by subscription, <span class="italic">Rhymes and Recollections of a Hand-Loom Weaver</span>, which contained the powerful &#145;Whisperings for the unwashed&#146;. One thousand copies of the book were distributed and Thom received donations from admirers amounting eventually to several hundred pounds. It was said these admirers included Scottish merchants living in Calcutta. By this time Thom had formed a relationship with Jean Stephen (1821&#150;1848), of Inverurie, with whom he had three children. Literary success and this new relationship did not prevent Thom becoming the victim of his own personal weaknesses; he spent fewer and fewer hours at his loom and became a hard drinker. Between late 1844 and late 1847 Thom and his family lived in London. He was welcomed by Lady Blessington, Dickens, and Jerrold. Smith, Elder &amp; Co. republished his volume of poetry and waited for another. It never came. Though Thom formed close friendships with such literary-minded working men as George Julian Harney and Thomas Cooper, he did not heed their urgings to work at his poems. Offers of publication in journals were spurned, his relationship with Gordon collapsed, and his money ran out; in poor health, Thom left for Dundee in late 1847. He died, probably of tuberculosis, on 29 February 1848, at Hawkhill, Dundee, and was buried in the western cemetery, Dundee. One month later Jean Stephen, too, was dead; a public appeal eventually raised well over &pound;300 for their three children. Thom identified closely with the Paisley weaver-poet Robert Tannahill and, like him, was a tragic figure. Mostly he wrote in the Scottish dialect rather than standard nineteenth-century English, producing both lyrics and protest verse about the sufferings of the poor. He was undoubtedly a poet of greater talent than most of his early and mid-Victorian working-class colleagues.<br>
