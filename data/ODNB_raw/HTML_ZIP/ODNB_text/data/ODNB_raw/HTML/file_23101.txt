<span class="headword">Ramesey <span class="st"> [Ramsay]</span>,  William</span>  (1627&#150;1676?), <span class="occ">physician and astrologer</span>, was born on 13 March 1627 in Westminster, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23080/', "David Ramsay (c.1575&#150;1660)")</script>, a Scottish clockmaker, whom James I made keeper of his clocks and watches, and an English mother. Believing his paternal ancestors to have come from Egypt, Ramesey revised his surname in accord with what he thought to be its true spelling. He attended schools in and around London, including St Albans, Bushey, Westminster, and Mile End. He would have gone up to Oxford, but this intention was thwarted by the civil war, which also subsequently interrupted his studies at St Andrews. Moving to Edinburgh, he was obliged to leave by an outbreak of plague. He returned to London in April 1645.<br>
<br>Ramesey continued to study both physic and astrology. However, unlike most of his contemporaries combining these pursuits&#151;notably Nicholas Culpeper&#151;Ramesey was a royalist, unhappy with what he called &#145;this perverse and rebellious Age&#146;  (Ramesey, 29). But the increasing identification of astrology itself as perverse and rebellious, on political as well as religious grounds, left him increasingly isolated. His <span class="italic">Lux veritatis, or, Christian Judicial Astrology Vindicated, and Demonology Confuted</span> (1651) was a reply to the criticisms of Nathanael Homes in <span class="italic">Daemonology and Theologie</span> (1650); it was answered in turn by another divine, William Rowland, in <span class="italic">Judiciall Astrologie, Judicially Condemned</span> (1652).<br>
<br>Ramesey's contribution to this debate was undistinguished, being mostly a repetition of points made by Christopher Heydon half a century earlier. The main difference between the two lies in Heydon's confident tones and Ramesey's defensive, petulant manner. He also signally failed to present a convincing case for astrology's religious probity; after arguing that it deals only with natural causes and transgresses neither God's secrets nor man's free will, he provided examples of astrology at its most magical, answering horary questions, such as &#145;Where is my husband?&#146; and &#145;When shall I receive the money due me?&#146;<br>
<br>In 1652 Ramesey produced another small astrological work, <span class="italic">Vox stellarum</span> (not to be confused with the better-known almanac of the same name by Francis Moore). By now he was living with his father &#145;in Holborn, within two doors of the wounded Heart, near the King's Gate&#146;  (Ramesey, preface). In that year he received his MD at Montpellier, and on 31 July 1661 was admitted as an extra licentiate to the College of Physicians.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Astrologia restaurata</span> (1653) is Ramesey's principal work: it is a thorough if rather ponderous introduction to astrological theory and practice in all its branches, including horary, elections, nativities, and physic. Ramesey even included a section on &#145;Teaching how to judge of the permanency or durability of Kings, or such as are in Authority by any Revolution&#146;  (Ramesey, 225), exactly the sort of thing that was undermining the standing of his beloved subject.<br>
<br>Ramesey's subsequent publications include a theological tract, <span class="italic">Man's Dignity and Perfection</span> (1661), <span class="italic">De veneris, or, A Discourse of Poisons</span> (1663), and <span class="italic">Some Physical Considerations of &hellip; Wormes</span> (1668). By that time, astrology had almost disappeared from his work.<br>
<br>In June 1668 Ramesey was admitted MD at Cambridge by royal mandate; he is said to have by then become physician-in-ordinary to Charles II. He was now living in Plymouth, Devon. His last publication was <span class="italic">The Gentleman's Companion</span> (1676). According to Francis Bernard, he died that year while in prison&#151;for debt, John Gadbury believed.<br>
