<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stevens,  Thomas Terry Hoar</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Terry-Thomas]</span>  (1911&#150;1990), <span class="occ">actor and comedian</span>, was born on 14 July 1911 at his parents' home in Finchley, Middlesex, the third child and third son in the family of four sons and one daughter of (Ernest) Frederick Stevens, managing director of a produce merchant's business, and his wife, Ellen Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph Hoar, horse dealer, of London. He was educated at Ardingly College, Sussex. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Corps of Signals (1941&#150;6) and with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA).<br>
<br>Stevens began his career as a clerk at Smithfield market, but his interest in amateur theatricals led him to work as a film extra. He took the stage name of Terry-Thomas, which he hyphenated to match the gap in his front teeth. His props were a diamond-encrusted cigarette holder, monocle, raffish waistcoat, and red carnation. Six feet in height, handsome in appearance, with a neat moustache and a natural upper-class accent, Terry-Thomas personified the Englishman as an amiable bounder. With his drawling accent, he commonly used phrases such as &#145;rotter&#146; and a leering &#145;jolly good show&#146;. Once established, the character changed little from film to film. He toured with ENSA during the Second World War and, when demobilized, turned to cabaret work. In 1946 he found success with Sid Field in a West End hit, <span class="italic">Piccadilly Hayride</span>. He soon became popular on radio, with his own personal caddish humour, on <span class="italic">To Town with Terry</span> (1948&#150;9) and <span class="italic">Top of the Town</span> (1951&#150;2). He also presented his own television series&#151;<span class="italic">Strictly T-T</span> (1949&#150;56) and <span class="italic">How do you View?</span> (1951&#150;2).<br>
<br>The Boulting brothers brought his natural comic talents to universal acclaim when they cast Terry-Thomas, with Ian Carmichael, Dennis Price, and Richard Attenborough, in their film <span class="italic">Private's Progress</span> (1956), in which he uttered the words &#145;You're an absolute shower&#146; in his best upper-crust voice, words which were to become a catch-phrase. This led to a succession of memorable films, which included <span class="italic">Brothers in Law</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Carlton-Brown of the FO</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span> (1958), <span class="italic">I'm All Right, Jack</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">School for Scoundrels</span> (1960). In the early 1960s Terry-Thomas went to Hollywood, where he had to coarsen his already not very subtle persona, and he made several films, including <span class="italic">How to Murder your Wife</span> (1964, his favourite film, in which he acted with Jack Lemmon), <span class="italic">Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">Monte Carlo or Bust</span> (1969). He was also a frequent performer on American television, appearing with Danny Kaye, Judy Garland, Andy Williams, and others. A return to the BBC in 1968, with a series called <span class="italic">The Old Campaigner</span>, had only a modest impact. In the late 1970s he discovered that he was suffering from Parkinson's disease, which put an end to his career.<br>
<br>In 1938 Stevens married a dancer, Ida Florence (<i>d</i>. 1983), the divorced wife of Ernest Stern and daughter of Philip Patlansky, hotel proprietor. There were no children of the marriage. After a divorce in 1962 he married in 1963 Belinda, daughter of Geoffrey Percy Cunningham, a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Artillery. They had two sons. A millionaire at the height of his fame, after his premature retirement he and his wife went to live in a villa on Ibiza, where he had built up land and property holdings. However, his illness caused him to spend &pound;40,000 a year on medical bills and he had to return to Britain. Following a succession of house moves, he was discovered in the late 1980s living in reduced circumstances in a church charity flat in Barnes, London, furnished by the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Friends in show business staged a benefit concert for him at London's Drury Lane Theatre in April 1989. The money that it raised enabled him to live in comfort at Busbridge Hall Nursing Home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there of pneumonia on 8 January 1990. At his funeral service the organist played the theme tune to one of his favourite films, <span class="italic">Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines</span>.<br>
