<span class="headword">Skene <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gillespie]</span>,  Lilias</span> <span class="st"> [Lillias Skein]</span>  (1626/7&#150;1697), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and poet</span>, was the daughter of John Gillespie (<i>d</i>. 1627 or <i>c</i>.1647), minister of Kirkcaldy; according to conflicting accounts, her father died either around the time of her birth or shortly after her marriage. Her mother was Lilias Simson (<i>d</i>. 1627), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25605/', "Patrick Simson")</script>, minister of Stirling. One of at least eight children, her brothers included the Church of Scotland ministers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10737/', "Patrick Gillespie")</script>, principal of Glasgow University, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10735/', "George Gillespie")</script>, minister of St Giles, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Lilias Gillespie married at Kirkcaldy on 26 August 1646 an Aberdeen merchant, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69912/', "Alexander Skene (1621?&#150;1694)")</script>, magistrate and author of <span class="italic">Memorialls for the Government of the Royall-Burghs in Scotland</span>. She moved with him to Aberdeen, and between 1647 and 1669 bore ten children. Her eldest surviving son was John Skene (<i>c</i>.1649&#150;1690), deputy governor of West Jersey (1685&#150;8)  (<span class="italic">Papers of William Penn</span>, 96n., 105n.). She and her husband were fervent covenanters, respected for the strength of their faith even when their strict presbyterianism became impolitic at the Restoration. It caused a local sensation when, about the time when her last child was born in 1669, she suddenly converted to Quakerism. Her husband followed suit in 1672. Of her own conversion she wrote: &#145;It is very well known to all that lived in the place where I sojourned, I was none who conversed with them, I was never at one of their meetings, I never read one of their books&#146;, yet she experienced &#145;that thing the school-men call Immediat Objective Revelation&#146;  (Skein, 203). She continued to be known locally as Lilias Gillespie, but within Quaker circles she was called, English-style, by her husband's surname.<br>
<br>Lilias Skene was the leading woman in Aberdeen's tiny but influential Quaker community, which included such figures as Robert Barclay, George Keith, and Alexander Jaffray of Kingswells. Quaker meetings were often held in the Skenes' house. She appears to have been the only woman to join the men in adjudicating disciplinary matters. About 1678 she helped establish the first Quaker school in Scotland. Lilias Skene's leadership and activism came to the fore between 1676 and 1679, years of persecution in Aberdeen when every adult male Quaker in the region (about thirty in all) spent months or years in prison&#151;including her husband, eldest son, and son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14583/', "Andrew Jaffray")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14582/', "Jaffray, Alexander")</script>] of Kingswells, who had married her daughter Christian. Quaker women remained at liberty and continued to meet and lobby for the men's freedom. Lilias Skene was very active through this period. In a ferocious letter of 31 March 1677 to the Aberdeen magistrates, she refers to her own preaching (&#145;at severall seasons and in diverse maners I have witnessed&#146;) and goes on to condemn their imprisoning &#145;honest men that have families wives and children &hellip; in those cold nasty stinking holes where ye have shutt them up, who have been as neatly handled and tenderly educated and as usefull in their generation as any amongst you&#146;  (&#145;Brieff account of the most material passages&#146;, 37&#150;9). It has been plausibly claimed, but cannot be confirmed, that she assisted her husband in compiling the two manuscript accounts of the history of Quakerism in Aberdeen which he produced in the early 1680s.<br>
<br>Lilias Skene also turned her pen to epistolary evangelizing. In 1676 Robert Barclay encouraged her to write to Elisabeth, princess palatine of the Rhine (1618&#150;1680), cousin of the Stuart kings, who Quakers hoped would intervene on their behalf even if (as happened) she could not be converted. Barclay introduced Skene to her as &#145;a woman of great experience and tenderness of heart who through great tribulations both of body and mind hath attained the earnest of the Kingdom [but whose] husband and son-in-law are now in Prison&#146;  (Hull, 27). Skene corresponded with the princess and her companion, Countess Anna Maria van Hoorn (or de Hornes), and was invited to visit them at Herford, Westphalia. George Keith's biographer claims she accompanied Keith, Barclay, George Fox, and William Penn on their tour of the Netherlands and Germany in the summer of 1677, and Barclay tells us she intended to go. But neither Penn nor Fox mentions her in their journals of the trip, and in a letter written to her in 1678 the princess seemed to imply that they had not met: &#145;I love your upright intention to travail (i.e. toil) in spirit for your friends, though unknown to you&#146;  (ibid., 33). Skene was in London in the summer of 1677, and also visited the bedridden philosopher and recent Quaker convert Anne, Viscountess Conway, at Ragley in Worcestershire. She befriended and corresponded with Anne Conway, and was entrusted with hiring new household staff for Ragley, all Quakers&#151;a task she could arrange from Aberdeen, thanks to her extensive contacts in the English Quaker community.<br>
<br>Lilias Skene's letters and poems are among the few surviving literary works of non-aristocratic seventeenth-century Scottish women. Her only known publication in her lifetime (the author spelling her name Lillias Skein) was &#145;An Expostulatory Epistle, Directed to Robert Macquare&#146;, dated June 1678 and appended to one of Robert Barclay's polemics in 1679. Macquare (better known as Robert McWard) was a presbyterian dissenter whose vitriolic rants against Quakers had earlier drawn Alexander Skene into print. Lilias Skene's effort was gracious and restrained, but firm: &#145;O Robert! thy hard speeches have manifested thy own sad acknowledgement to be very true, the Holy fire is gone out with thee indeed&#146;  (Skein, 201). In the nineteenth century William Walker published (from his own transcription of a manuscript since lost) selections from thirty lyric poems and three anagrams composed between 1665 and 1697  (Walker, 85&#150;102). Lilias Skene's poetry, like her prose, was filled with mystical allusions and scriptural images of suffering and salvation. The Aberdeenshire poll-tax book of 1696 finds her widowed and living modestly in Aberdeen with her daughter Anna and two servants. She died there on 21 June 1697, three years after her husband, and was buried beside him in an unmarked grave in the Quaker burial-ground at Kingswells.<br>
