<span class="headword">Collins,  Anthony</span>  (1676&#150;1729), <span class="occ">philosopher and freethinker</span>, was born on 21 June 1676 at Isleworth, Middlesex, the eldest child of Henry Collins (1646/7&#150;1705), lawyer, and Mary Dineley. He was educated at Eton College and then at King's College, Cambridge, from 1693 to 1696, but did not take a degree. At King's his tutor was Francis Hare, the future bishop of St Asaph and of Chichester. It was from Hare, Thomas Woolston wryly observed, that Collins &#145;imbibed his Notable notions about Religion and Liberty&#146;  (T. Woolston, <span class="italic">Fourth Discourse on the Miracles of our Saviour</span>, 1727, v). He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 24 November 1694, although a career in law, in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, did not attract him. On 8 July 1698 he married Martha Child (<i>bap</i>. 1676, <i>d</i>. 1703), a daughter of the prominent banker, lord mayor of London, and MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5286/', "Sir Francis Child (1641/2&#150;1713)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Wheeler (1651/2&#150;1720). Their marriage was governed by a settlement stipulating that the extensive properties accumulated by Collins's father and grandfather in Middlesex and Essex were to be held in trust. The couple had four children, two sons and two daughters; the elder son died in infancy, and the birth of the second daughter occasioned the death of her mother, in 1703.<br>
<br>Early on Collins came to know and be influenced by two other well-known freethinkers, John Toland and Matthew Tindal. Collins financially assisted Toland, who dedicated two books to him: <span class="italic">The Fables of Aesop</span> (1704) and <span class="italic">Adeisidaemon, sive, Titus Livius a superstitione vindicatus</span> (1709). Henry Dodwell, Thomas Hearne, and Thomas Burnet, among others, claimed that Collins helped Tindal to write a number of other works, especially <span class="italic">The Rights of the Christian Church</span>. Collins's intense friendship with John Locke, whom he came to know in 1703, was seminal to his intellectual and personal development. Locke treated him like a son and saw in him an intellectual successor, nurturing his philosophical talents. Collins later arranged for Locke's letters to him to be published, together with other scarce materials and unpublished manuscripts shown to him by Locke, in <span class="italic">A Collection of Several Pieces of Mr John Locke</span> (1720), edited by his friend Pierre Des Maizeaux. The most significant compliment that Locke bestowed on him, in a letter of 29 October 1703, was that Collins's love of truth for its own sake was as great as that of anyone he had known. The theme of the love of truth, especially in religion, pervades Collins's writings.<br>
<br>Collins made his d&eacute;but as an author with <span class="italic">A Letter to the Learned Mr Henry Dodwell</span>, prompted by the controversy that the nonjuring Dodwell aroused with his <span class="italic">An epistolary discourse, proving, from the scriptures and the first fathers, that the soul is a principle naturally mortal</span> (1706). Newspaper advertisements show that it appeared in print in November 1706, well before the work commonly thought to have been Collins's first, <span class="italic">An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions</span>, which was published in March 1707. Like all his writings it appeared anonymously. Dodwell had notoriously argued that though the soul was naturally mortal God had immortalized it with the Christian revelation to save the blessed or punish the wicked. In a reply to Dodwell, Samuel Clarke argued that the soul was naturally immortal by proving that it was immaterial. Furthermore Clarke maintained that consciousness could not be attributed to a material subject and accused Dodwell of thoughtlessly publishing views that encouraged sceptics in their attempts to undermine religion. Collins addressed his letter to Dodwell as a defence of his right to publish his opinions even if, as Collins made clear, he disagreed with most of them. Collins argued that Clarke's argument for the soul's immateriality was misguided because, like Locke, he held it to be neither in the power of unaided human reason to prove such a conclusion nor necessary for the defence of religion. Unlike Locke, however, Collins maintained that experience suggested a material subject of consciousness. In a series of exchanges with Clarke over the next two years Collins argued that Clarke had been mistaken to infer that if consciousness belonged to a material and divisible subject it would necessarily belong to all parts, which would be an absurd conclusion. He also defended the idea that human liberty, defined as the power of acting as one wills or pleases, is compatible with necessity. He developed this view in <span class="italic">A Philosophical Enquiry Concerning Human Liberty</span> (1717) and insisted that the endemic obscurity of such philosophical debates could be ended only by using clear and distinct ideas. His arguments were rebutted by Clarke, and their exchange was overshadowed in significance only by Clarke's correspondence with Leibniz. His philosophical duel with Clarke was regarded by the French philosopher Jacques-Andr&eacute; Naigeon as having established Collins's place in eighteenth-century thought.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions</span> (1707) Collins attacked the clergy for insisting that the mysteries of religion, such as the Trinity, are not only &#145;above reason&#146; but also are required to be believed as a condition of Christian faith. Like Toland in <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span> (1696), he claimed that we cannot assent to what we do not understand; the proper response is suspension of belief. In <span class="italic">Priestcraft in Perfection</span> (1710) and <span class="italic">An Historical and Critical Essay, on the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England</span> (1724) he challenged the power of the bishops to settle controversies of faith and their claim to possess a divinely sanctioned authority in religion akin to the divine right of kings. Such claims struck him as expressions of &#145;priestcraft&#146; and assaults on the rights of individual reason. In <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Divine Attributes</span> (1710) he examined the views of the Huguenot philosopher Pierre Bayle on the intractable problem of evil for a Christian monotheistic theology and criticized Archbishop William King's attempt to evade this difficulty by claiming that God's attributes only bear an analogy to their human counterparts. Collins showed that King's solution removed the possibility of human beings emulating divine attributes and came dangerously close to an atheist's view. His handling of the controversy displayed his talent for sceptical modes of argument, asserting little in his own right while showing how proposed solutions to theological difficulties only exacerbated the problem that gave rise to them.<br>
<br>At the core of Collins's philosophy is his defence of &#145;freethinking&#146;. He first used the term in <span class="italic">A Discourse of Free-Thinking</span> (1713), where he defined it as the impartial use of the understanding to determine the meaning of propositions, and to judge their truth or falsity, their probability or improbability on the strength or weakness of available evidence. He argued that freethinking, so defined, is a universal right and in religion a duty. In defending the latter he catalogued how the clergy differed on nearly every issue&#151;so much so that some readers saw his real purpose as being to show that all these differing opinions were false. There were dozens of replies in Britain and on the continent, where a French translation soon appeared, including responses from Jonathan Swift, George Berkeley, Benjamin Hoadly, Richard Bentley, and Francis Hare. The theme common to the attacks was that freethinking was nothing more than a disguise for a covert, self-serving, sceptical, atheistic, and libertine agenda. The work was publicly burnt by the common hangman, and the controversy was said to have occasioned the second of two journeys that Collins made to the Netherlands, the first having occurred in 1710.<br>
<br>About 1716 Collins moved from London to rural Essex, where he assumed the responsibilities of a country gentleman. He served as JP, and as county treasurer restored the county's chaotic finances to good order. Whether in London or the country he was praised by those who knew him for his upright moral character, and as such his life was a standing reproof that freethinking was a licence for moral libertinism. In 1720 he collaborated with John Trenchard, a friend of his, and Thomas Gordon on a famous paper, the <span class="italic">Independent Whig</span>, in which they attacked clerical claims to authority and accused the high-church clergy of practical atheism. Among the closest of his friends who frequently visited him was Pierre Des Maizeaux, whose reviews of Collins's works drew them to the attention of continental readers. One of the many attractions of Collins's house to Des Maizeaux was its splendid library. When it was auctioned after his death there were more than 7000 lots, including complete runs of continental periodicals and pamphlets. Collins boasted to Dodwell that his collection of works by Anglican divines could rival anyone's. He owned rare manuscripts of biblical criticism by Spanish Jews and a copy of the scandalously irreligious work <span class="italic">La vie et l'esprit de Spinosa</span>, better known as the <span class="italic">Treatise of the Three Imposters</span>. Collins remained a widower until the premature death of his son Anthony, in 1723, after which he married Elizabeth Wrottesley (<i>d</i>. 1737), fourth daughter of Sir Walter Wrottesley, third baronet (1659&#150;1712), and his first wife, Eleanor Archer (<i>d</i>. 1694), in 1724. She was the sister of Hugh Wrottesley (<i>d</i>. 1725), a lawyer at Lincoln's Inn and a book collector, to whom Des Maizeaux dedicated <span class="italic">A Collection of Several Pieces of Mr John Locke</span>.<br>
<br>The period from 1723 until Collins's early death from the stone, from which he suffered throughout this time, was highly productive. Starting with <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion</span> (1724), he subjected the argument from prophecy, widely relied on to demonstrate the truth of Christianity, to painstaking scrutiny. The truth of Christianity would be demonstrated, he argued, only if Jesus Christ could be shown to be the Messiah prophesied by the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. But, he claimed, the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> Messiah was a temporal not a spiritual figure; furthermore the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophecies were not uniquely and literally fulfilled in Jesus. Although William Whiston had explained this mismatch between the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New Testaments</span> by arguing that scriptural texts had been corrupted with the object of undermining Christianity, Collins masterfully set the rival accounts against each other. Following the Dutch scholar Grotius, he accepted that even the most defensible text supported only typical fulfilment of the prophecies by Jesus, and then only by extended analogy. Thus, working from premises granted by others in the classic sceptical manner, Collins accepted both that the text was suspect and that its most defensible interpretation fell short of the proof required.<br>
<br>Collins's fondness for such modes of argument makes it difficult to place him. He himself repeatedly claimed to be nothing more than a freethinker who was prepared to follow reason wherever it took him and ready to expose the weakness of conventional arguments. Some, like Voltaire, viewed him as a deist and a scourge of Christianity, whereas others, such as Berkeley, saw him rather as an atheist. Others still, like Clarke, maintained that in practice all these positions reduced to the same. The attacks on Collins's <span class="italic">Discourse of Free-Thinking</span> were skirmishes compared with the outpouring occasioned by his <span class="italic">Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons</span> and his subsequent works. Some such as Edward Chandler, bishop of Lichfield, and John Rogers, sometime chaplain to George II, urged the state to take action against him for questioning widely held and well-established views whose maintenance, they argued, was crucial to good order. In his last works Collins responded to his critics by arguing that it was in the interests of both the state and society to extend, not restrict, the rights of free expression and of religious toleration in worship as well as belief. These rights were necessary to give effect to the right of free examination and to promote rather than undermine the peace and well-being of communities. For him they were the real legacy of the protestant Reformation.<br>
<br>Collins died on 13 December 1729 at Cavendish Square, London, and was buried in the new burial-ground belonging to St George's, Hanover Square. He left his library to his widow, who sold it at auction, and his manuscripts to Des Maizeaux. Des Maizeaux, upset that Collins left him only &pound;50, sold the manuscripts to Elizabeth Collins, an action that he quickly regretted but was powerless to undo. She took pains to ensure that they would not see the light of day. Collins is known to have drafted defences of his position on the liberty and necessity of human action, and referred in his published works to other manuscripts on subjects such as ecclesiastical history and miracles, but at the beginning of the twenty-first century all remained undiscovered.<br>
