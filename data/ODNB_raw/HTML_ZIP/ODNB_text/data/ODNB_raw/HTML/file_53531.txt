<span class="headword">Adams,  Thomas</span>  (1807&#150;1873), <span class="occ">lace merchant and manufacturer</span>, was born on 5 February 1807 at Worksop, Nottinghamshire, the son of Thomas Adams, a maltster, and his second wife, Catharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, of Sutton-cum-Lound, Nottinghamshire. The elder Adams moved his family to Ware, Hertfordshire, but died while Thomas was still a child. His widow took her children to Sheffield, where Thomas received a modest education before being apprenticed at the age of fourteen to a draper at Newark, Nottinghamshire. Afterwards he worked for a short time in the London warehouse of Bodens, the Derby-based lace manufacturers. He was also in France for a time. In 1830 he returned to Nottingham, where he established his own business, buying plain and decorated nets from some of the 1200 or so artisans active in the district, which he then finished and sold on to wholesalers and retailers. In 1832 he began a long partnership with James Page and other small manufacturers, trading as Adams, Page &amp; Co. at St Mary's Gate. Adams and Page discarded the lesser capitalists in 1856 but incorporated in 1862, the foundation capital being &pound;112,000.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1830 Adams married Lucy Cullen, the daughter of a Nottingham draper; they had ten children over the next twenty years. The completion of a railway line between London and Nottingham brought increased trade and prosperity for Adams. Wholesalers and exporters now travelled directly to Nottingham to buy their nets and laces, the quality and design of which had improved steadily over the previous thirty years. A few other manufacturers opened their own warehouses, but, unlike Adams, such men lacked the necessary commercial experience and capital. The <span class="italic">Nottingham Daily Guardian</span> (19 May 1873) reported: &#145;We have heard it stated that he was a hard and sharp man of business, not exactly that he would do anything dishonest&#151;that we do not believe&#151;but one who would make a good bargain.&#146; Adams seems to have concentrated on the home market but may also have been selling to Mediterranean countries.<br>
<br>In the years following the <span class="roman">Nottingham Enclosure Act</span> of 1845 the old commercial heart of the town was rebuilt as the Lace Market, and in 1855 Adams proudly opened his new palatial warehouse at its centre in Stoney Street, though it was criticized by some as too grand for commercial purposes. Before long it employed 600 people, 500 of them women, who enjoyed the amenities of a library, a schoolroom, rest rooms, a canteen, and, probably the most important to Adams, a chapel where the employees could begin their working hours by attending a daily service at his expense. During these years Adams emerged as the leading evangelical layman in Nottingham. He gave generously towards the cost of building new churches in the growing city and he promoted missionary societies and Sunday schools. He sat as a JP on both town and county benches, was elected to Nottingham corporation in 1836, and was a member of the Poor Law Board for many years, but he seldom attended these last two bodies, admitting that he found it easier to make money than to make speeches. The whig majority on the corporation denied him the opportunity of becoming alderman or mayor.<br>
<br>Adams's health began to fail about 1870, and he died at his home, Lenton Firs, Lenton, Nottingham, on 16 May 1873. He was buried on 19 May in the Church cemetery at Forest Road, memorials being placed to him in Lenton parish church and St Mary's, Nottingham. His wife survived him, but his sons Samuel and John, whom he hoped would succeed him in business, both died young. The firm continued for another two generations, largely because of Adams's policy of promoting senior clerks to the board.<br>
