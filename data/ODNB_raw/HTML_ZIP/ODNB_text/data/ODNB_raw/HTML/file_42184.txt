<span class="headword">Ferrand <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Busfeild]</span>,  William</span>  (1809&#150;1889), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 26 April 1809 at Cottingley Bridge, near Bingley, the eldest son in the family of thirteen of Currer Fothergill Busfeild (1777&#150;1832) and his wife, Sarah, sister of Edward Ferrand of St Ives, near Bingley. He was educated at Bingley grammar school and briefly at Giggleswick School, and was articled to solicitors at Bradford and Keighley from 1825 to 1830. A liaison with Sarah Priestley, daughter of a retired army captain in Bradford, led to his marriage to her in 1831, some time before the birth in July of their son, William. Sarah died in December 1832 giving birth to a daughter, Sarah Harriette. When in 1837 Busfeild's mother inherited her brother's considerable property, he became her manager, residing at Harden Grange. In 1839 he took the additional surname of Ferrand and on succeeding to his mother's estate in 1854 dropped the name of Busfeild (though contemporary documents refer to him as William Busfeild Ferrand after this date).<br>
<br>Busfeild entered public life in 1833 with his energetic support of Oastler's factory agitation in the West Riding and later encouraged local opposition to the 1834 <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span>. Although defeated as tory candidate for Bradford in the general election of 1837, he continued active in Yorkshire politics, opposing the Anti-Corn Law League and helping to found a short time committee at Bradford. Elected as MP for Knaresborough in the 1841 general election, he attracted immediate attention by his vehement parliamentary attacks on Cobden and the league, poor-law administration, and Sir James Graham's factory legislation. By 1843 his distrust of the government, including its Irish policy, brought him into association with the Young England group of Lord John Manners, George Smythe, and Benjamin Disraeli. He opposed the grant to the Roman Catholic seminary at Maynooth in 1845, and in the corn-law crisis of 1846 supported Lord George Bentinck, though family affairs caused his absence from the crucial corn and Irish coercion debates.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1847 Lord Harewood withdrew his support at Knaresborough and Ferrand was unable to find another constituency. Nevertheless, his marriage in August 1847 to the Hon. Fanny Mary Stuart (1816&#150;1896), sister of Lord Blantyre, brought him into an influential circle of society and in 1850 he resumed his political career, campaigning for a national policy of protection and a Farmers Wool League to boycott cotton in favour of the native product. He unsuccessfully contested Aylesbury at a by-election in 1851 and was abroad with his invalid wife when Lord Derby formed his 1852 ministry. His subsequent efforts to start a labour league in the industrial north, uniting tory manufacturers, Anglican clergy, and working-class reformers, failed to attract popular support.<br>
<br>When Lord Derby's second administration dissolved parliament in 1859, Ferrand was offered the Conservative candidature at Devonport and fought a lively but unavailing contest. After two further defeats at by-elections there the same year, he was finally elected at a third in 1863. In the Commons he resumed his attacks on whig officials and Liberal mill owners, secured an act in 1864 for compensating victims of industrial accidents, and was instrumental in forcing the resignation in 1865 of the lord chancellor, Lord Westbury, on charges of nepotism. Although re-elected for Devonport in the general election of 1865 he was unseated on petition. Defeats at by-elections at Coventry in 1867 and Devonport in 1868 proved the end of his parliamentary career. He died on 31 March 1889 at St Ives, which had been his home since 1854, and was buried on 4 April at Bingley church.<br>
<br>A tall, broad-shouldered man with massive features and stentorian voice, Ferrand was described as &#145;Dantonesque&#146; in appearance and a &#145;burly agitator&#146;. Politically his numerous crusades failed more often than they succeeded; his strident language made him an often embarrassing colleague; and his perpetual quarrelsomeness, in local as well as national affairs, detracted from his reputation as a serious politician. Yet Lord John Manners remained his devoted friend and he enjoyed a loyal working-class following in Yorkshire. He represented a genuine if primitive strain of historic toryism and his career illustrates the many cross-currents in Victorian party politics.<br>
