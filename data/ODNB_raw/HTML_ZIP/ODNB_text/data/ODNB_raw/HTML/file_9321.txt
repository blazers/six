<span class="headword">Ferguson,  James Frederic</span>  (1806&#150;1855), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Charleston, South Carolina. His father was Jacques Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Jaquemain of Cambrai, who left France during the revolution and assumed the name Ferguson in 1793. Six years later he went to America, and in 1800 he became deputy postmaster at Beaufort, South Carolina, where he remained until 1812. He was also a professor at the local college. After the death of his English wife, Ferguson senior became a teacher of languages in London and subsequently established a school in St Stephen's Green, Dublin. James Frederic Ferguson, the son, accompanied Samuel Cooke of Sunderland, a relative by marriage, to Dublin in 1821, having returned from Charleston to London in 1814, and was engaged with Cooke on behalf of Lord Kingsland in endeavouring to recover for that nobleman the Kingsland estates. His efforts were partially successful through his extensive research in the records of the courts of exchequer and common pleas. He next became a collaborator with William Lynch, a former clerk to the Irish record commission and author of <span class="italic">Feudal Dignities in Ireland</span>, in arranging the voluminous series <span class="roman">Irish Records</span>, perhaps after Lynch had finished his work on <span class="italic">Inquisitionum in officio rotulorum cancellariae Hiberniae asservatarum repertorium</span> (1826). Valuable and extensive collections of documents were formed, some of which afterwards passed into the library of Sir William Betham. In 1843 he published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Limitations of Actions Bill intended for Ireland; Together with Short Extracts from Ancient Records Relating to Advowsons of Churches in Ireland</span>.<br>
<br>Ferguson's most important work was the indexing of the entire body of exchequer records in Ireland, which he completed unassisted. The indexes were purchased by the government in order to be permanently deposited in the court of exchequer. In 1850 Ferguson was appointed clerk and secretary to a commission for arranging the records of the Irish courts, and this office he held until its abolition two years later. However, by direction of the chief baron, he continued in charge of the records until his death. In 1853 he went, at his own expense, to Switzerland and Germany in order to recover some Irish records from the collection of a Swabian baron. These records proved to belong mostly to the Irish court of king's bench in the reign of Edward III, with one membrane from the reign of Edward I for the court of common pleas, and some later rolls from the reigns of Henry VI and James I; it was surmised that they had been stolen in the reign of George I, before Addison became keeper of the records in the Bermingham Tower. Ferguson bought them at his own cost, and after his death they were purchased by the government and lodged in a Dublin repository. They were subsequently placed in the Public Record Office of Ireland. A report of Ferguson's actions is contained in <span class="italic">Transactions of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society</span> (2, 1852&#150;3, 387&#150;9), of which society Ferguson was Dublin corresponding member. To the same publication in 1854&#150;5 he communicated a calendar of the contents of the &#145;red book&#146; of the Irish exchequer, and in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (2nd ser., 43, 1855) he published a description of an ancient drawing of the court of exchequer contained in this manuscript calendar. To <span class="italic">The Topographer and Genealogist</span> he communicated an account of Sir Toby Caulfeild relative to the earl of Tyrone and other fugitives from Ulster in 1616; a curious series of notes on the exactions incident to tenures in Ireland in ancient times; a list of the castles in Ireland in 1676, with a note on hearth-money; and a remarkable document of <span class="roman">3 Edward II</span> concerning a contest between the king's purveyors and the secular clergy of co. Meath. Ferguson also contributed two important articles to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> on the neglected state of Irish records (1853&#150;4), and a paper on the unpublished statutes of Ireland (1855). At his death he left incomplete a translation of the &#145;Norman-French chronicle of the conquest of Ireland&#146;, which Francisque Michel edited from a manuscript in Lambeth Palace Library. It was hoped that the translation would be completed by J. P. Prendergast, but there is no evidence that it was ever published. Ferguson was also commissioned by Charles Haliday to research the earlier city assembly rolls and also the records of the court of exchequer for information on the port and harbour of Dublin.<br>
<br>Ferguson died on 26 November 1855 in his lodgings in Rathmines, Dublin, and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.<br>
