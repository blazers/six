<span class="headword">Davies,  George Maitland Lloyd</span>  (1880&#150;1949), <span class="occ">pacifist</span>, was born on 30 April 1880 at the family home in Peel Road, Sefton Park, Liverpool, the fourth surviving son of John Davies (1837&#150;1909), tea merchant, and Gwen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (1839&#150;1918). The family attended Princes Road Presbyterian Chapel in Liverpool and their life was strongly inflected by the social and cultural world of the expatriate Liverpool Welsh community. Davies was deeply affected by the social stigma attached to his father's bankruptcy in 1891. He was educated in Liverpool and started work at Martin's Bank in that city at the age of sixteen, quickly rising to the position of secretary to the manager. In 1908 he was appointed manager of Martin's Bank in Wrexham, and took a commission in the Territorial Army. In 1913, following a mental breakdown and a realization that he could not kill other people, he resigned his commission in the Territorial Army and also left the bank. He was offered, and accepted, the post of secretary to the Welsh Town Planning and Housing Trust.<br>
<br>This was a period of frequent changes of direction for Davies after the certainty and security of his early career in banking. At the start of the First World War he was a founding member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a Quaker-influenced peace organization that required members to make individual contributions to reconciliation, rather than take part in public protests. He worked for the organization in London for a while, before moving on to the Riverside Settlement, Melton Mowbray, a home for delinquent teenagers. On 5 February 1916 he married Leslie Eleanor Royde Smith (1884&#150;1973), sister of the novelist Naomi Royde Smith, at Finchley; they had one child, Jane Hedd. Refusing military service when conscription was introduced in 1916, he came before a tribunal and was sent to work as a shepherd in north Wales. From January 1918 to June 1919 he was imprisoned as a conscientious objector, first at Wormwood Scrubs, where he spent time in solitary confinement, and later at Princetown on Dartmoor and at Knutsford work camp in Cheshire. On his release from prison he lived on the Gregynog estate in Montgomeryshire and became involved in promoting reconciliation in agriculture and industry. At the request of Thomas Jones, secretary to Lloyd George's cabinet, he went to Ireland in 1920 and 1921 to try to broker talks between Eamon de Valera and Lloyd George. Although myths grew about the success of this visit, including suggestions that he &#145;single-handedly sorted out the war of independence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Peace News</span>, 13 Jan 1950, 4), his intervention in Irish affairs was inconclusive, although he worked hard to get his message across, and eventually was summoned to an interview with De Valera in the Mansion House in Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1923 Davies was elected to parliament as an independent Christian Pacifist candidate for the University of Wales, a constituency whose electors were graduates of the university. He took the Labour whip but never joined that or any other political party, asserting his wish to retain the freedom to speak and act according to his conscience. He was one of a number of conscientious objectors who took their seats in this parliament; his maiden speech was on the <span class="roman">Irish Free State Bill</span>. He lost the seat at the following election in 1924 and redirected his energies to religion, social action, and writing.<br>
<br>In 1926 Davies was ordained a minister in the Calvinistic Methodist church (later the Presbyterian Church of Wales). He was the pastor of churches at Tywyn and Cwm Maethlon in Merioneth from 1926 to 1930, when he became interested in social improvement and developed his ideas relating to industrial reconciliation. About 1926 he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Politics of Grace</span>, in which he suggested that reconciliation methods could be used in all fields, from politics and industry to animal training. In the early 1930s he was involved in the settlement movement at Bryn-mawr in south Wales, at Rhosllanerchrugog, near Wrexham, and at the Quaker settlement at Maes-yr-haf in the Rhondda valley. At this time he was concerned with developments on the continent. This theme was dealt with in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Reparations and Industrial Ruin</span> (published in 1932, but written in the early 1920s) in which he correctly prophesied that the harshness of the Versailles treaty, which required Germany to export large quantities of free coal to markets formerly supplied by the coalfields of south Wales, would have a dire effect on Wales's industrial life.<br>
<br>In 1937 the Welsh National Pacifist Society (Heddychwyr Cymru) was established, with George Davies as president and Gwynfor Evans (later Plaid Cymru's first MP) as secretary. The society, a response to the Anglocentric attitude of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, published dozens of pamphlets. At this time Davies was close to a number of intellectuals who were prominent in the young Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (the Welsh National Party), though he did not become a member. This was a period when he was conscious of the possibility of another major war and he was trenchantly critical of the growth of fascism. Davies was particularly active in promoting peace during the 1940s, publishing three pamphlets in Welsh for the Fellowship of Reconciliation: <span class="italic">Ffordd y cymod</span> (&#145;The way of reconciliation&#146;); <span class="italic">Gandhi a chenedlaetholdeb India</span> (&#145;Gandhi and Indian nationalism&#146;); and <span class="italic">Triniaeth troseddwyr</span> (&#145;The treatment of prisoners&#146;). In 1946 he published <span class="italic">Essays towards Peace</span>, a collection of twenty-two of his articles, including some letters from prison. Between 1946 and 1949 he was chairman of the Peace Pledge Union.<br>
<br>George Davies was a charismatic figure who inspired deep personal loyalty and was commonly regarded by those who knew him as a &#145;saint&#146;, an incongruous description in nonconformity. This perception of his saintly persona has ensured an iconic&#151;but sometimes misleading&#151;impression of his life and achievements. His prison experience, more than any other influences, turned him from a Liberal to a socialist, and he wished to share, as much as possible, in others' poverty. While working at the Maes-yr-haf settlement in the Rhondda in the 1930s he chose to live alone in a small shed rather than to share the staff quarters. He suffered from depression throughout his adult life and committed suicide on 16 December 1949 while a voluntary patient at the North Wales Mental Hospital, Denbigh, but the suicide does not seem to have damaged his reputation as a &#145;saintly&#146; peacemaker in Wales. He was buried at Dolwyddelan, his family's home village.<br>
<br>Apart from his political and social work, George Davies published books, pamphlets, and many articles in Welsh- and English-language periodicals and newspapers on peace and reconciliation, but also on such subjects as housing, the economy, the prison system, Ireland, and the state of the Calvinistic Methodist church in Wales.<br>
