<span class="headword">Birch,  John</span>  (1615&#150;1691), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, was born on 7 September 1615, the second, but first surviving, son and heir of Samuel Birch (<i>d</i>. in or after 1648) of Ardwick Manor, near Manchester, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1659/60), daughter of Ralph Smith of Doblane House, Lancashire. The Birches of Ardwick were probably a cadet branch of the Birches of Birch Hall, one of the &#145;Genevas of Lancashire&#146;  (Heath-Agnew, ix). John Birch's father became a presbyterian elder and county committeeman after the civil war, and the eminent Lancashire nonconformist divine Henry Newcome preached at his mother's funeral on 16 January 1660. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66928/', "Samuel Birch (1620/21&#150;1680)")</script> was a parliamentarian captain and later a vicar at Bampton, Oxfordshire, until being ejected in 1662. Another brother, Thomas, corresponded with Richard Baxter, held Hampton Bishop rectory near Hereford (1654&#150;83), and became a fellow of Manchester collegiate church.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer"></a>Military career</h2>Birch's activities before the civil war are obscure, although he would later admit to a lack of formal education. In 1633 he moved to Bristol, where he developed an extensive trade as a wine merchant. There he met his first wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of Thomas Deane of Bristol and widow of Bristol grocer Thomas Selfe, and they had five children&#151;Mary, John, Samuel, Elizabeth, and Sarah. By the summer of 1642 Birch commanded a Bristol company of puritan volunteers who in March 1643 foiled a royalist conspiracy. In July a royalist assault on the city succeeded and he lost his fortune. He sold his remaining merchandise, found a commission in the regular parliamentarian army under Sir Arthur Hesilrige, and brazenly demanded that the committee of safety repay his losses. His first actions as regimental commander in December were successful at Alton and Arundel Castle and at the latter he was seriously injured and given up for dead. But he returned to lead his regiment at Alresford, the siege of Winchester, and Cropredy Bridge, and his actions were among the few bright spots in the earl of Essex's western campaign in mid-1644. Hesilrige took over his regiment and converted them to dragoons; Birch, now colonel, was given command of a regiment from Kent and was back in action by September. His regiment helped the New Model Army capture Bridgwater and Bristol, and parliament appointed him governor of Bath and then Bristol.<br>
<br>Although Birch had considered resigning from the army in November 1645, the capture of Hereford on 18 December following capped his military career. Malcontents from the Hereford royalist garrison revealed to him that the walled city, which had resisted the Scots' siege, could be infiltrated. After a subterfuge of marching his troops away from the area Birch made a hard march back in the evening (several soldiers died in the snow) and hid his men. He then disguised several soldiers as a repair crew who were admitted, opened the gates, and allowed Birch's troops to pour into the city. Some 120 royalist lords, knights, and gentlemen were captured. Parliament was ecstatic and Birch was appointed governor of Hereford Castle. He earned the enmity of the dean, Herbert Croft, by opening the Hereford vicars' choral cloisters to those made homeless by his men's attack, the memory of which long rankled in the county.<br>
<br>Birch continued to assist the mopping up campaign in the southern Welsh marches by besieging Goodrich and Raglan castles in June and August 1646, and he increasingly focused on Herefordshire politics. After attempting to replace Edward Harley as junior knight for the shire he retreated to Leominster to be returned to parliament in September 1646 (and was appointed high steward there in 1648). By late 1646 local feeling ran against Birch's troops, and, when he tried to quarter his cavalry on former royalists and neutrals, Edward Harley and others complained. As a result Birch planned to send his regiment to Ireland. In the tumultuous summer of 1647 his troops mutinied and briefly seized the colonel and his brother Major Samuel Birch. Soon afterwards he divested his remaining military ties and purchased the Homme near Leominster, where his family lived until 1661.<h2>
<a name="Interregnumintrigueandpolitics"></a>Interregnum, intrigue, and politics</h2>Birch was briefly active as a presbyterian member in the Long Parliament. He was sent to Edinburgh in June 1648 to protest against the Scots' engagement with Charles I, and he let it be known that he would resist &#145;an evil-grounded peace&#146;  (Underdown, 89). He was purged, nevertheless, by Colonel Pride in December 1648, and was indeed among the forty-three arrested MPs and one of the last to be released in January.<br>
<br>Edmund Ludlow later complained that Birch &#145;used to neglect no opportunity of providing for himself&#146;  (Underdown, 240), and certainly, after parliament's finance committee agreed to pay him &pound;1050 with interest for money lent to Lord Essex in 1642, he bought church lands in his adopted shire, particularly the bishop's palace at Whitborne. But his outspokenness during the 1650s was not based on self-interest. He refused the engagement and he and his brother attended upon Charles II at Worcester in 1651 (although he left before the battle began). Later he baited the Cavalier Parliament by noting that &#145;[w]hen I waited on the King at <i>Worcester</i>, I saw very few there besides myself&#146;  (Grey, 6.366). During the interregnum he baited local radicals and as a result was imprisoned, by his own count, twenty-one times. A letter from the radical governor of Hereford to Oliver Cromwell in 1655, after Penruddock's rising, reveals Birch relishing his role as gadfly:<blockquote>Col. Birch &hellip; in the middle of the Assizes &hellip; gave out before the judges, that the present insurrections &hellip;, did not consist of cavaliers, but a company of silly Quakers. &hellip; He also told me &hellip; that the great matter was our own jealousies, and fears. Considering this, and what we know of his carriage when the Scots were in Worcester &hellip;, I thought it my duty &hellip; to secure him, which I have done, and as his sword was taking from him, (he refusing to deliver it), said, though my sword is short now, it may be long enough within a while, (the sword hanging by his side, being a little short sword), and very angrily asked me, whether I had orders to secure him. I answered, if I have not, you will question me. He replied, yes, that I will. (<span class="italic">Diary of the Rev. Henry Newcome</span>, 205n.)</blockquote>James Berry, major-general of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, who secured Birch's release, noted that &#145;the man is popular in these parts, and he loves to be so. He is taken for a great wit, and guilty of some honesty &hellip;, but he professeth desire of peace, and settlement&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Returned to parliament for Leominster in 1656 Birch was among those denied the right to take their seats. He also supported Herefordshire presbyterians in their unsuccessful election bids against more radical individuals. One memoir claims that after Cromwell's death he &#145;harangued&#146; the spectators at a local horse race on &#145;the distractions of the state&#146; and the need for a restoration  (Bodl. Oxf., MS top. Cheshire.e.7, fol. 38). Yet the government needed his organizational skill and employed him as a commissioner of excise in 1657. He was again returned for Leominster in Richard Cromwell's parliament in January 1659. Although initially not allowed to sit he went on to become one of the most active members. He spoke forcefully for settling Richard's title and for a settlement under a single person and parliament, and against a republic and the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;. His enemies claimed with little evidence both that he supported Booth's rising and that he stayed in touch with his former and anti-monarchical soldiers in London long after they were disbanded in 1660.<br>
<br>Readmitted to the Long Parliament with his fellow secluded members in February 1660 Birch was appointed to the new council of state. Alongside two other individuals he was authorized by Monck to take charge of the Hereford garrison, to slight the castle and city walls, and to take the arms to Ludlow. However, local royalists resented Birch and during April, when he was returned for Leominster to the Convention (despite Edward Massey deploying his interest in the borough against him), rumours circulated that the garrison &#145;had not nowe beene demolished but for Coll. Birch &hellip;, from whom noe good can be expected&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70007, fols. 76&#150;7). But the government valued him more than they feared him, as witnessed by his appointment as a Herefordshire militia officer in May. Thereafter he briefly oversaw both the Admiralty and the disbandment of the army, and it was not the last time he bothered Samuel Pepys with &#145;scrupulous inquiries&#146; into navy accounts  (Ferris, 1.654). Moreover, in February 1661 he became auditor of the excise for life with a salary of &pound;500 p.a. and worth perhaps double that.<h2>
<a name="TheCavalierandExclusionparliaments"></a>The Cavalier and Exclusion parliaments</h2>Birch had inserted himself uneasily into the rather insular Herefordshire squirearchy. He had spent nearly &pound;2500 on church lands in the county, and in 1660 Richard Baxter interpreted his desire for Baxter to accept the offer of the bishopric of Hereford as a means of insuring his purchases, trusting that such a moderate figure was less inclined to demand their return. By 1670 the eventual incumbent, Bishop Croft, calculated that he had paid &pound;2000 to &#145;the greedy harpy&#146; Birch  (Heath-Agnew, 117) &#145;to cleer ye B[isho]prick. of all incumbrances&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 147, fol. 79), and the two did not agree terms until 12 April 1672. However, his interest in Leominster had all but evaporated by the Restoration, and in 1661 he purchased Garnstone estate, just outside Weobley, and cultivated an interest in that tiny borough. At the level of local politics he was listed on the Herefordshire <span class="italic">Libri Pacis</span> from 1660, but did not attend quarter sessions before 1666, and was to be most active from 1675 to 1680. On the national level he retreated to a safe government seat for Penryn borough in the 1661 elections.<br>
<br>In the Cavalier Parliament, Birch advanced several forward-looking if unsuccessful schemes, ranging from a plan to rebuild London after the fire to bills to force landlords to sow flax and hemp to employ the poor. He also oversaw attempts to implement the act for River Wye navigation after it was passed in 1662 until well into the 1670s. However, his greatest contribution was on the subject of religion. During debate on the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> in 1663 he acted as teller for the rejected proviso on behalf of those who received the sacrament at least once every three years. He conformed, at least outwardly, to the Church of England, although he occasionally met the presbyterian Newcome, and gave one ejected minister &pound;5 each year. Birch also supported religious comprehension. When he was called on to introduce a loosely worded bill in 1667 he prevaricated, but in early 1668 he did indeed introduce a more carefully drafted version for including moderate nonconformists within the established church. He repeatedly defended dissenters as the trading part of the nation and sought comprehension rather than toleration of separate sects and Catholics. But the Commons responded by introducing the second <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> instead, and, despite his last-ditch fight against it, it passed the house. He repeatedly antagonized the Commons by his &#145;shameful&#146; attack on the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> and his comment that he &#145;knows not what churches are for, if they are not to be preached in&#146;  (Heath-Agnew, 140, 151). Perhaps in response to such puritan sentiments the Lords slighted him by referring to &#145;John Birch, Esq.&#146; rather than his cherished army rank  (ibid., 177), and he also seems to have carried on a low-key war with local Herefordshire churchmen. In 1676 rumours spread to London that he had asked his parish priest to marry him to his common-law wife of the past fifteen years, although his lawful wife still lived. In fact, Alice had died on 3 September 1675 and he did then marry Winifred (<i>d</i>. 1717), daughter of Matthew Norris of Weobley.<br>
<br>During the second half of the 1670s Birch increasingly warned about the French threat abroad and the popish threat at home. In 1674 he spoke against the Third Dutch War and in 1677 he demanded an anti-French alliance. As late as May 1679 he supposedly advised the imprisoned earl of Danby to give the Commons &#145;a deduction of the affairs of state from the time the Triple Alliance was broke&#146; in 1668  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 409). Even while he criticized court policy he worked hard building the crown's revenue; Andrew Marvell labelled him &#145;Black Birch&#146; for his work on the hated excise  (Heath-Agnew, 131), and anti-court pamphlets labelled him a pensioner. The Treasury commissioners were also so reliant on him to examine various accounts that Danby could not afford to dismiss him despite his anti-court sentiments.<br>
<br>Birch was well primed to believe in a popish plot when the scare broke in the autumn of 1678. In early 1674 he had reminded the Commons that a Catholic priest seized in Herefordshire in 1671 had been freed, presumably, by powerful friends. He also warned against the division of &#145;Religion into any other rivulets than Papist and Protestant&#146;  (Grey, 2.228). On 15 April 1678 he reported to the Commons upon the mood of Herefordshire where &#145;they are in fear of Popery and worse&#146;  (ibid., 5.273&#150;4). Upon discovery of the Popish Plot parliament ordered Birch to search the cellars and he complained when prayers contained &#145;not one word in them of the Papists, nor the Plot named&#146;  (ibid., 6.170). Yet he spoke against motions to detect Catholics because he claimed that such tests &#145;may turn against us another time&#146;  (ibid., 6.87&#150;8). In April 1679 the old trooper, now returned for Weobley, feared that &#145;[i]f the Plot had taken effect, the Army must have fallen to the next person upon the Throne&#146;  (ibid., 7.68).<br>
<br>Historians have labelled Birch an exclusionist whig, but he followed a tortuous route towards supporting the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, often wavering and toying with expedients. Although, in May 1679, Birch spoke for exclusion and urged withholding supply until the king assented, he also spoke against those attacking Lord Halifax for opposing exclusion in the Lords. By 1680, although he was heartened by the king's willingness to search for expedients, he continued to fear &#145;the power and strength of the Duke's party&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Exact Collection</span>, 113). Finally, in the third Exclusion Parliament he at first urged a day be devoted to considering expedients and spoke in favour of &#145;limitations&#146;  (Heath-Agnew, 189), but two days later noted that &#145;where 10 were of the mind for this [exclusion] Bill a twelve-month ago, there are an 100 now that will bleed for it&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4.1330&#150;31).<br>
<br>Birch, in his rationale for agreeing to the extra-parliamentary and extra-constitutional association, significantly shifted from attacking popery to attacking the high Anglican defence of absolute monarchy. He believed that the clergy's &#145;Laudean principles&#146; had made them defend &#145;the King's absolute authority&#146; in 1641 and again in 1680  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4.1240&#150;41). &#145;Popery never can nor will grow but by absolute Government&#146;  (Grey, 8.34), he exclaimed in November 1680; and he found such a link in the southern marches in the power and crypto-Catholic clientele of the marquess of Worcester. In December 1680 and January 1681 Birch joined a chorus of local MPs who denounced the evil influence of Worcester. He drove home the point about papists in masquerade: &#145;Queen <i>Mary</i> came in by Protestants&#146;  (ibid., 8.194&#150;5). After the Oxford parliament he met the earl of Shaftesbury when the latter sought the Herefordshire members' commitment to arms. But although he organized a cabal in the county he failed to appear and backed away from commitment to radical action  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 290&#150;92).<br>
<br>However, Birch's opponents at Westminster and in Herefordshire were not quick to forget his criticisms of the regime. In 1680 he was removed from the commission of peace and libels circulated against him. In early 1683 a local informant considered him to be among &#145;other ill-affected persons&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>Jan&#150;June 1683</i>, 93&#150;4) and he eventually lost his Weobley seat in 1685. By then Birch had retreated to the role of country squire, improving his estate and repairing Weobley church.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>In 1688 the ageing colonel roused himself to action. Although James II, in February 1687, had considered making Birch a deputy lieutenant, Birch firmly supported William of Orange. He slipped out of London and contacted Robert Harley and both joined William at Salisbury, where Birch helped convince the prince to descend upon London without first securing Oxford and presented him with a &pound;40 subscription from the Herefordshire gentry.<br>
<br>Re-elected for Weobley to the convention of 1689, Birch was amazingly active in parliament during the last two years of his life. His speeches often referred to events from the 1640s, 1650s, and 1660s&#151;in effect, framing his life. He prefaced his opposition to fasting on 30 January 1689 with a reference to the fight against tyranny and popery during the past forty years. He compared the Restoration Convention to that of 1689 in order to argue that drastic actions, such as excluding some members, were sometimes necessary in &#145;great revolutions&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 5.131). In March, during a debate on whether to insist that the monarch uphold the church as by law established, he reminded parliament of how the Scots had rebelled &#145;when abp. Laud would not have a hair bated of the Discipline of the Church; and what followed upon it? That brought on the war in England&#146;  (ibid., 5.203). And in June he claimed to be one of the few surviving MPs who had been in parliament when the Popish Plot &#145;was so clearly proved, that all England was satisfied&#146;  (ibid., 5.294&#150;5). In December he compared the Jacobite rising in Ireland with the Irish rising in 1641.<br>
<br>By April 1690 Birch admitted that he was &#145;an ancient man&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, col. 609, 28 April 1690), and he disappears from parliamentary debates. He returned to Garnstone, which had roughly doubled in size since he had purchased it. His eldest son predeceased him and he used his Lancashire manors to benefit his son's daughters. He himself died at Garnstone on 10 May 1691 and he was buried at Weobley church. Yet even in death the old parliamentarian trooper stirred up controversy. He had arranged for a monument to himself to be constructed in Weobley church in full military gear which not only trumpeted his parliamentarian military service but also was built so that its railings extended into the raised altarway. In 1694 Bishop Gilbert Ironside went personally to Weobley to deface the monument. The monument and inscription remain visible today (although the reinscription altered his birth date to 1626), and so do the holes where the railings were ripped out. Birch's youngest daughter, Sarah, inherited Garnstone on the condition that she marry the second son, John, of his brother Thomas. This John Birch, a successful barrister, also inherited Birch's Weobley seat, which he held almost continuously from 1701 until his death in 1735.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Historians have long been drawn to the colourful character of Birch. His contemporaries painted him as &#145;immoral&#146;  (Herbert Aubrey, in Ferris, 1.660), vile (Massey), or opportunistic (Ludlow and Baxter), although Harley recalled him as his &#145;ancient friend and companion in arms for religion and liberty&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70234). Bishop Burnet gave a balanced if critical judgement: &#145;He was the roughest and boldest speaker in the House &hellip;, [who] spoke always with much life and heat: but judgment was not his talent&#146;  (Ferris, 1.660). The next generation forgot the great Commons man, but in the Victorian era Thomas Babington Macaulay lauded &#145;Honest Birch&#146;  (Heath-Agnew, xi), Thomas Heywood produced a somewhat unreliable encomium of him in his edition of Newcome's diary, and in 1864 John Webb edited John Roe's military memoir of Colonel Birch.<br>
