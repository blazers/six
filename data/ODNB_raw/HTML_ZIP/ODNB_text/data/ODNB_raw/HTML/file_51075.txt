<span class="headword">Guntrip,  Henry James Samuel <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1975), <span class="occ">psychotherapist and Congregational minister</span>, the son of Henry Richard Guntrip (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1923) and his wife, Harriet Louise Jessop (<i>d</i>. 1953), was born at 103 Dulwich Road, London, on 29 May 1901. His father, a commercial clerk, was the youngest of seven children. Before his marriage he was lively and enjoyed cricket. A Methodist lay preacher, he was founder of a breakaway evangelical movement, The Ranters. His liveliness declined after his marriage to Harriet Jessop, a harsh, dominating, and unmaternal woman whose own childhood had left her embittered. Because of her own mother's incapacity she had cared for many younger siblings. In marriage she had no more time for babies; she wanted to be a businesswoman, and was a shopkeeper. Harry was the first child; a brother, Percy, was born two years later. At sixteen months Percy died, when Harry was three and a half, and this trauma and his own and his mother's responses to it were central to his childhood illness. After Percy's death he became seriously ill but recovered by being sent away from his mother, who was incapable of keeping him emotionally alive. She dressed him as a girl and had him circumcised when he was five. Between three and a half and five he developed psychosomatic illnesses, later understood as attempts to gain his mother's love and attention.<br>
<br>Guntrip's fight for independence began by joining the Salvation Army at the age of eight. From 1913 he attended Alleyn's School, Dulwich, where he was a vigorous athlete, particularly enjoying cricket. He was an enthusiastic member of the Salvation Army but, after two years of training to become an officer he left and in 1921 went to London University where he took a degree in philosophy and psychology; a degree in divinity at the Congregational New College followed in 1924. In his theological and philosophical training he was influenced by the personal relationship philosophy of John MacMurray and the philosophy of Martin Buber; he later found resonances of these in his psychoanalytic work. Guntrip entered the Congregational ministry, first at St John's Church, Ipswich, then at Salem Congregational Church, Leeds, where he spent the rest of his life. He was an energetic minister, a powerful orator, and a good communicator; he strove to integrate religion and psychoanalysis, seeing both of them as dedicated vocations to bring God's love and understanding. His marriage in the early 1920s to Bertha Kind, a shorthand typist and then nurse, whom he had met in the Salvation Army, was an invaluable support throughout his life.<br>
<br>Guntrip's journey into psychotherapy began when he sought help for his own distress, insomnia, and psychosomatic symptoms. He began therapy with two Freudian-inclined therapists, Hugh Crichton-Miller and Clifford Allen, both of whom stuck to rigid Oedipal-level interpretations. He was not much helped by this therapy and it was a great relief when he was introduced to the object relations theory of Ronald Fairbairn. By now Guntrip had become a therapist himself in Leeds with patients referred both by Leeds University and by general practitioners.<br>
<br>Fairbairn, a philosophically trained psychoanalyst, evolved a radical revision of psychoanalytic theory, replacing Freud's drive theory, that biological forces seek tension relief, with the relational theory, that human infants seek and need loving and caring responsiveness. Failing to get these, if the mother is not able to be appropriately loving, they turn inwards, feeling that their own love is bad and dangerous and that this is why they have been rejected. Living primarily within inner worlds with internal objects they are not able to experience full loving relationships. From 1949 to 1960 Guntrip worked with Fairbairn, travelling from Leeds to Edinburgh for his eleven hundred sessions, constantly overworking to make up for lost time at his ministry. In addition, he was treating many patients and lecturing in the university. Using his photographic memory Guntrip began his psychoanalytical autobiography, recording all his dreams and all his sessions. His analysis with Fairbairn enabled him to explore his relationship with his mother, not approached in his previous therapy, and the consequences of Percy's death. His mother, increasingly paranoid, insisted on living with him and Bertha for the last nine years of her life, which compounded his psychological difficulties.<br>
<br>In Guntrip's account he was not only Fairbairn's patient, he became his collaborator in his revision of psychoanalytic theory and in the early 1960s began to write his own psychoanalytic papers. In 1960 Guntrip felt that his work with him had reached its limits as Fairbairn aged and had recurrent illnesses. In 1962 Guntrip began analysis with Donald Winnicott in London, who, he felt, would understand and cope with his needs to regress to very early stages of infantile dependence and helplessness; according to Guntrip's account he found what he needed. His healing relationship with Winnicott released him from his closed inner world. The analysis ended in 1969; Winnicott, in fragile health, died in 1971.<br>
<br>In the years following this analysis Guntrip wrote the papers and books that made his international reputation and led to invitations to the United States. The first visit, in 1968, to New York and Washington came through the interest aroused by his papers on the schizoid personality, the books <span class="italic">Personality Structure and Human Interaction</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Schizoid Phenomena, Object-Relations and the Self</span> (1968), and the growing interest in America about British contributions to psychoanalysis. Though not a member of the British Psychoanalytic Society, Guntrip's importance was eventually conceded and he was invited to speak to the society, which greatly pleased him.<br>
<br>Guntrip was a fluent, clear writer, able to articulate emotional conflicts and issues, to clarify psychoanalytic theory, and to insist on the need for continuing theoretical and technical developments. He saw the problem of schizoid isolation as the core of neurosis, the withdrawal from full relationships through fear and terror, the false belief that one's own love is bad and destructive. The only release from this is through a psychoanalysis in which these fears are understood, where the real loving attitude of the therapist to the patient gradually allows fears to surface and the patient can take the risk of entering into a fuller relationship with the therapist. Guntrip's writings have been influential and have made psychoanalysis, in particular object relations theory, more accessible. They are the writings of a man with a mission to communicate and to convert, and represent his own integration of religion and psychodynamic science.<br>
<br>As well as Guntrip's rich legacy of papers and books there is a fascinating (unpublished) psychoanalytic autobiography, a record of his dreams of over thirty years and of his analyses with Fairbairn and Winnicott, subject of a famous paper  (Guntrip, &#145;My experience&#146;). Valuable as this legacy is, it has to be treated with reserve: we have only Guntrip's account, and the very fact of his writing accounts of all his analytic sessions indicates compulsive overactivity, a feature of his psychopathology. We do not know how much his accounts of Fairbairn's and Winnicott's interpretations represent what they actually were. With this reservation, this is a unique record of deep psychoanalytic experiences.<br>
<br>Guntrip died in the General Infirmary, Leeds, from carcinomatosis on 18 February 1975. His wife survived him.<br>
