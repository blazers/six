<span class="headword">Nye, Sir  Archibald Edward</span>  (1895&#150;1967), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Ship Street barracks, Dublin, on 23 April 1895, the youngest but one in the family of three sons and three daughters of Charles Edward Nye (<i>d</i>. 1930) and his Irish wife, Mary Sexton. His father was a regimental sergeant-major in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry. Having been an outstanding scholar at the Duke of York's royal military school, Dover, he was preparing to become an army schoolmaster when war began in August 1914. He volunteered for combatant duty and, serving as a non-commissioned officer in France, was selected in 1915 for a commission in the Leinster regiment. Twice wounded in action, and awarded the MC for gallantry thereafter, he was granted a regular commission in 1922 in the Royal Warwickshire regiment, given the demise of the Leinsters, a southern Irish regiment. Lacking any private means, Nye never drank, and helped to pay his mess bills by winning games of billiards. In the military doldrums of the 1920s Nye's quick, keen mind drew him to the staff. In 1924&#150;5 he attended the Staff College, Camberley. He soon acquired a high reputation, brevet, and accelerated promotion through exchange of regiments. While holding demanding appointments he managed simultaneously to qualify as a barrister at the Inner Temple in 1932.<br>
<br>Recognized as a potential general officer, Nye was returned to regimental duty to command the 2nd battalion, Royal Warwickshire regiment in 1937, earned at once a recommendation for higher command, and was appointed to raise the Nowshera brigade in India in 1939. Nye married (Una Sheila) Colleen, daughter of General Sir Harry Hugh Sidney Knox, during that year, and they had one daughter. Colleen also had two children from her previous marriage to Colonel N. D. Stevenson.<br>
<br>War once again changed Nye's plans. He was recalled to London a few months after leaving for India, and was soon later promoted major-general as director of staff duties in the War Office, the branch concerned with organization and co-ordination. During the crises of 1940 his enterprise, moral courage, and mastery of complex politico-military policy impressed Winston Churchill; when Sir John G. Dill was removed as chief of the imperial general staff in 1941, Nye was one of three possible successors in his mind. But seniority and experience in high command weighed in this selection. Sir Alan Brooke was chosen; Nye was promoted lieutenant-general and vice-chief. Fortunately the two men complemented and had absolute confidence in each other. They carried a formidable workload for four years until victory in 1945. Nye accompanied Brooke on many of his important journeys during the war. At its end Brooke wished to make Nye adjutant-general, but another option was offered: governor of Madras. Retiring as CB (1942), KBE (1944), and KCB (1946) Nye returned to India in 1946.<br>
<br>Nye's support for independence there inspired Jawaharlal Nehru to ask him to stay in post when imperial government ended. Further, his firmness and wisdom in the ensuing political, racial, and caste turbulence prompted the Indian government to suggest his appointment as United Kingdom high commissioner at Delhi when he completed his extension in Madras in 1948. In this second post he developed successfully the new and friendly relationship between the British and Indian governments, enhancing it by skilful diplomacy during the opening and greater part of the Korean War.<br>
<br>Nye departed from India in 1952 with the honours GCIE (1946) and GCSI (1947), and was appointed high commissioner to Canada. In his four years in Ottawa his most notable success was the extension of British&#150;Canadian trade; perhaps his most difficult political task was the representation of British policy on the Suez Canal. Retiring in 1956, Nye left many official and personal friends in Canada. He had received the freedom of the capital city, academic honours from Bishop's, McGill, Toronto, and McMaster universities, and had been appointed GCMG by his own government in 1951. For some years he held several directorships in commercial companies, but in 1962 he returned temporarily to government service as chairman of a committee to consider reorganizing the War Office. The work of this body&#151;the Nye committee&#151;influenced profoundly the reshaping of the army's headquarters for the rest of the century.<br>
<br>Nye made an important contribution to the high political and military policies of his country, and often played a crucial part in their execution over more than twenty years. His reputation is, happily, unsullied by any manifestation of jealousy, bitterness, or disregard towards those with whom he served. It is remarkable that he caught the attention of three prime ministers&#151;Churchill, Attlee, and Nehru&#151;each of whom wanted to place him in a significant position. Nye died in London on 13 November 1967.<br>
