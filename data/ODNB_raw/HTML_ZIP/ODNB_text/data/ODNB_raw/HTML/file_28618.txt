<span class="headword">Walsh,  Robert</span>  (1772&#150;1852), <span class="occ">author</span>, born in Waterford, was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28607/', "Edward Walsh (1756&#150;1832)")</script> and the younger son of John Walsh (1720&#150;1785), merchant, of Ballymountain House, co. Waterford. He was educated at Waterford and then entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 November 1789 as a pensioner, his tutor being Thomas Elrington (1760&#150;1835). He graduated BA in 1796. He was elected scholar in 1794 and was ordained in 1802, and, after being for a short time a curate in Dublin under Walter Blake Kirwan, was appointed in 1806 to the curacy of Finglas, co. Dublin, where he remained until 1820. While he held this curacy he discovered the &#145;cross of Nethercross&#146;, supposedly buried during Oliver Cromwell's victorious march through the country by the alarmed inhabitants. On digging in the place pointed out by some of the older people, who had been told of it by their parents, Walsh discovered a Celtic cross in good preservation. It was erected in the churchyard of Finglas.<br>
<br>In 1813 Walsh married Ann Eliza Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of John Bayly of Tolka. They had two children, a daughter and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28613/', "John Edward Walsh")</script>, who became a judge and MP.<br>
<br>Walsh spent several years of his earlier life as a curate preparing a <span class="italic">History of the City of Dublin</span> (2 vols., 1815), a well-received work, in which he drew on the research of James Whitelaw and John Warburton.<br>
<br>In 1820&#151;during which year he received a certificate of diploma of MD from the Royal College, Aberdeen, as well as a grace for the degree of LLD from Trinity College, Dublin&#151;Walsh accepted the offer of the chaplaincy to the British embassy of Lord Strangford at Constantinople. He remained in that post for some years, during which time he made many extensive expeditions through Turkey and other parts of Asia, on occasion using his medical skills while in remote areas. From Constantinople he went to the embassy at St Petersburg, to which he had been appointed chaplain, but in 1828 went to Rio de Janeiro. He published the well-reviewed <span class="italic">Notices of Brazil</span> (1830) and his investigations into the slave trade in Brazil led to his appointment to the committee of the Society for the Abolition of Slavery.<br>
<br>After returning to Britain in 1831 Walsh was again sent to Constantinople. He finally settled in Ireland about 1835, and was given the living of Kilbride, co. Wicklow, which he exchanged in 1839 for that of Finglas, co. Dublin. He died at Finglas on 30 June 1852.<br>
<br>Walsh wrote much for periodicals, but his main works stem from his knowledge of Turkey and include <span class="italic">An Essay on Ancient Coins, Medals, and Gems</span> (1828), <span class="italic">Narrative of a Journey from Constantinople to England</span> (1828), <span class="italic">Residence at Constantinople during the Greek and Turkish Revolutions</span> (2 vols., 1836), and <span class="italic">Constantinople and the Scenery of the Seven Churches of Asia Minor</span> (2 vols., n.d. [1839?]). Many of his publications were favourably reviewed at the time.<br>
