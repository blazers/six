<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  James  fitz Gerald</span>, fifteenth earl of Desmond <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Queen's Earl, Tower Earl]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1601), <span class="occ">nobleman and prisoner</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9556/', "Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond (d. 1583)")</script>, and his second wife, Eleanor Butler (<i>d</i>. 1636&times;8), daughter of Edmund Butler, Baron Dunboyne. His sobriquets reflect the fact that much of his life was spent incarcerated in the Tower of London. He was born during his father's third period of detention in London (1568&#150;73), perhaps at the Southwark home of Sir Warham St Leger into whose custody Desmond and his companions had been placed in August 1570. When Desmond returned to Ireland in March 1573 James remained behind as a <i>de facto</i> pledge for his father's good behaviour, and in June that year Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, to whose faction the earls of Desmond were loosely allied, presented young James to the queen at Desmond's behest, presumably as a prelude to securing James's return to Ireland. This was not forthcoming, however, and in June 1575 Desmond was asking William Cecil to intercede with the queen to allow James, then at Bristol, over to Ireland for a time. This appeal also proved unsuccessful.<br>
<br>By August 1579, however, James was back in Ireland, residing with his mother at Askeaton, co. Limerick. His stay there was short, as once again his father's actions intruded on his life. James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald had returned to Ireland the previous July with a small force of men igniting what escalated into the second Desmond rebellion (1579&#150;83). The earl initially tried to remain neutral in the conflict, but this proved unsatisfactory for the crown, and between 7 and 9 September the lord justice, Sir William Drury, temporarily detained him in an attempt to force him to act against the rebels. He was released on condition that he deliver James to Drury, and a few days later James's mother, Eleanor, handed him over. James was kept at Kilkenny for a while before being placed on 30 October in Dublin Castle, where he remained for almost five years. Initially his circumstances in the castle were relatively good, since he had a nurse and some servants; but the servants were dismissed by the end of 1579, and his health, which appears never to have been particularly robust, suffered during his confinement. His education was also neglected, something his mother complained about in August 1582, Eleanor suggesting that he be taken to England. This suggestion was not acted upon at the time, but following Desmond's death on 11 November 1583 James's usefulness in Ireland was greatly diminished and six days later Adam Loftus, archbishop of Dublin, and Henry Wallop recommended he be transferred to the Tower of London, this being done the following year.<br>
<br>James spent the next sixteen years in the Tower, ignored by the queen and her officials, his entreaties to be released proving futile. However, the situation was changed in the 1590s when an upsurge in anti-plantation violence in Munster and the outbreak of the Nine Years' War in Ulster made James potentially useful to the crown once again. In 1598 James fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, grandson of James, thirteenth earl of Desmond, led the forces of Munster into rebellion, destroying the plantation and assuming the title of earl of Desmond. James fitz Thomas, known as the Sugan (straw-rope) Earl, allied himself with Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, and quickly gained control of Munster. In response to the worsening crisis there were calls for James to be sent over to Munster to help quell the violence. In October 1599 Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, who earlier that year had been appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland, suggested returning James to Munster where it was hoped he would attract the support of the Geraldines of the region and thereby weaken James fitz Thomas, a strategy advocated the following year by Sir George Carew, lord president of Munster. Elizabeth initially feared that James would either rebel if returned to Munster or prove ineffective and expensive, but Carew's persistence, mediated through Sir Robert Cecil, finally convinced her to implement the plan. He was granted a pension of &pound;500 p.a., and his patent creating him earl of Desmond was signed on 1 October 1600.<br>
<br>Accompanied by Meiler Magrath, archbishop of Cashel, Desmond sailed from Bristol and landed at Youghal, co. Cork, on 14 October. He was well received by some lords and gentlemen of the region, but this welcome was not universal. The mayor of Cork only grudgingly provided food and accommodation for him, while the undertakers feared that he might be granted lands they had received in the Munster plantation. More damaging was his reception in Kilmallock, co. Limerick, where arriving at the town on a Saturday he was greeted enthusiastically, but when he went to the local Church of Ireland service the following day many of the townspeople shunned him. He did achieve a notable success when the constable of Castlemaine handed over the castle to him, but this was an isolated case and the vast majority of the Geraldines and rebels in Munster ignored him. He was soon complaining to Cecil that he had no money, no troops to command, no land assigned to him, and no respect from the local population, asking to be either given sufficient money to accomplish his task or to be allowed back to England. His mission a failure, the latter option was agreed and James left Ireland on 22 March 1601. He continued to seek support from the crown but by then Elizabeth had abandoned him; he lived out the remaining months of his life in financial distress. James died in London, unmarried, before 14 November 1601, aged about thirty-one, having experienced little freedom during his life.<br>
