<span class="headword">Quin,  Frederic Hervey Foster</span>  (1799&#150;1878), <span class="occ">homoeopathic physician</span>, was born on 12 February 1799, probably in Ireland. Because of his forenames he was incorrectly regarded as the son of Lady Elizabeth Foster, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hervey, mistress and later second wife of the fifth duke of Devonshire; he may have been her godson. He attended a school in Putney run by a Mr Carmalt at what is now Carmalt Gardens. In 1815, after the Napoleonic wars ended, he was sent to France, where he became fluent in French. He attended Edinburgh University from 1817 to 1820 and graduated MD. He was immediately offered, by the prime minister, the post of physician to Napoleon on St Helena. Instead he went to Italy in December 1820 as physician to Elizabeth, by then duchess of Devonshire, and he attended her during her fatal illness in March 1824. Lord Byron invited him to accompany him on his (last) expedition to Greece, but to his regret Quin had to refuse on grounds of ill health. In July 1821 he commenced practice at Naples, and his social gifts made him popular with all the English residents there, who included Sir William Gell, Sir William Drummond, and the countess of Blessington, and with the Comte d'Orsay, upon whom Quin is said to have modelled himself.<br>
<br>At Naples, Quin met Dr Neckar, a disciple of Hahnemann, the founder of homoeopathy, and was impressed favourably enough to visit Leipzig in 1826, in order to study the system. He returned seriously interested if not converted. On the journey he met in Rome Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, afterwards king of the Belgians, and soon left Naples to become his family physician in England. Quin continued a member of the prince's household until May 1829, either at Marlborough House, London, or at Claremont, Surrey, and he extended his acquaintance in aristocratic circles. From May 1829 to September 1831 he practised in Paris, chiefly but not entirely in homoeopathy. In September 1831, after consulting with Hahnemann as to the treatment of cholera, he proceeded to Tischnowitz in Moravia, where the disease was raging. He contracted the disease himself, but recovered, though he never regained perfect health. He returned to work and under his treatment there were no deaths.<br>
<br>At length, in July 1832, Quin settled in London and introduced the homoeopathic system into England. He lived first at 19 King Street, St James's, and then removed in 1833 to 13 Stratford Place. His practice rapidly grew, owing as much to his attractive personality as to his medical skill. In 1844 he founded the British Homoeopathic Society (later the Faculty of Homoeopathy) which he served as president until his death. Chiefly through his efforts the London Homoeopathic Hospital (later the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital) was founded in 1849 in Golden Square, Soho; it moved to Great Ormond Street in 1859.<br>
<br>Quin was popular in London society. He was an essential dinner guest of Albert Edward, prince of Wales, and his friends included Dickens, Thackeray, the Bulwers, Macready, Landseer, and Charles Mathews. His contribution to homoeopathic literature was not of major importance. His value lay in the social and medico-political fields. His patients included the duchess of Cambridge, to whom he was physician-in-ordinary, the duke of Edinburgh, and many other members of the aristocracy. From these he was able to obtain the funds to endow the hospital. Their support was always available when homoeopathy was threatened by the medical establishment. Quin was frequently referred to as &#145;the little doctor&#146;, but Thomas Uwins's portrait shows him to have been a handsome man. A brilliant wit and a mine of information, he was also gifted with an unusual memory for past events. His welcome in society was not just due to his medical skill, nor his unusual wit; for though aware of the scandals and the secrets, he could also be relied upon as a true friend who kept confidences.<br>
<br>Throughout Quin's career homoeopathy was repeatedly attacked by the medical institutions and journals and Quin himself was denounced as a quack. In February 1838, when he was a candidate for election at the Athenaeum, he was blackballed by a clique of physicians led by John Ayrton Paris, who publicly attacked Quin with a virulence for which he had to apologize under threat of a duel. Despite chronic severe asthma and arthritis which necessitated his early retirement from practice, Quin ensured that these battles were won. Homoeopathy spread throughout the country and many of its remedies were appropriated by the conventional establishment.<br>
<br>Unfortunately Quin tended to regard the British Homoeopathic Society and the hospital as his personal property. He showed little patience with homoeopathic colleagues who had different views on policy, but recognizing his merit they tolerated his attitude.<br>
<br>Quin died of bronchitis at the Garden Mansions, Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, on 24 November 1878, and was buried four days later at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
