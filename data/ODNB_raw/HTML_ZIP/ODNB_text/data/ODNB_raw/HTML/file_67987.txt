<span class="headword">James,  Edward</span>  (1569&#150;1610?), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and translator</span>, was born in Glamorgan and proceeded to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 11 March 1586, when he was sixteen years old. He graduated bachelor of arts from Jesus College, Oxford, on 16 June 1589 and master of arts on 8 July 1592. He was elected a fellow of Jesus College, <i>c</i>.1589&#150;90, and continued to hold his fellowship until <i>c</i>.1596. He appears to have benefited greatly from the patronage of that distinguished scholar, William Morgan, who arrived as bishop of Llandaff in 1595. During Morgan's episcopate James was quickly advanced to become vicar of Caerleon, Monmouthshire, on 2 February 1596, rector of Shirenewton, Monmouthshire, on 8 August 1597, rector of Llangattock-juxta-Usk, Monmouthshire, on 15 April 1598, and vicar of Llangattock Feibion Afel, Monmouthshire, on 12 July 1599. Later, after Morgan had been translated from Llandaff to St Asaph in 1601, James became vicar of Llangattock-juxta-Neath, Glamorgan, on 23 July 1603 and chancellor of the diocese of Llandaff in 1606. There is no certainty as to the year of his death. J. C. Morrice gave it as 1610; but D. R. Phillips maintained that no successor was appointed until 1620.<br>
<br>The achievement for which James is best remembered is his translation into Welsh of the <span class="roman">Book of Homilies</span>, a sequence of twelve set English sermons intended to explain the basics of the Christian faith to congregations lacking a licensed preacher. James published his translation in 1606 under the title, <span class="italic">Pregethau a osodwyd allan trwy awdurdod i 'w darllein ymhob eglwys blwyf a phob capel er adailadaeth i 'r bobl annyscedig. Gwedi eu troi i 'r iaith Gymraeg trwy waith Edward James</span> (&#145;Sermons set forth by authority to be read in every parish church and chapel for the edification of the unlearned people. Translated into the Welsh language by the work of Edward James&#146;). He derived the inspiration for undertaking this task from his association with Bishop Morgan. The latter gathered about him at his episcopal palace in Matharn a small but industrious group of Welsh litt&eacute;rateurs, of whom the most prominent were Dr John Davies (later of Mallwyd) and Edward James. Although Morgan had left Llandaff in 1601, and was dead (1604) by the time the Welsh version of the homilies was published in 1606, the example of his classic biblical expression exercised a profound influence on James's own style. The latter seems to have owed nothing to the writings of the prolific school of prose authors of medieval Glamorgan. But his own elegant and idiomatic Welsh created a considerable impact not only on worshippers in Welsh churches but also on contemporary poets like Vicar Rhys Prichard. In spite of this, curiously enough, no new edition of the work appeared before 1817, when John Roberts, vicar of Tremeirchion, Flintshire (1775&#150;1829), published his version. Later, in 1847, Morris Williams 
    (Nicander; 1809&#150;1874)
   ventured on a further edition.<br>
