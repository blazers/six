<span class="headword">Oppenheim, Sir  Duncan Morris</span>  (1904&#150;2003), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at Highfield, St Helens, Lancashire, on 6 August 1904, the second of three sons of Watkin Oppenheim, solicitor, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McKechnie, a strict Presbyterian who passed on to him a spartan way of life. On his father's side his family were protestants from Budapest, who had come to England in 1740. His grandfather, Henry Samuel Oppenheim, was solicitor and executor to Thomas Beecham, founder of the pill firm in the town. Watkin Oppenheim had followed his father into the law, as did Duncan after education at Repton School. In 1929 he joined the commercial solicitors Linklaters and Paines in London. His marriage on 14 January 1932 to the 26-year-old Joyce Mary Mitcheson, daughter of Stanley Dodd Mitcheson, a club secretary, ended after a year when she died childless.<br>
<br>In 1934 Oppenheim became a solicitor with British American Tobacco (BAT), briefly serving in China. On 3 October 1936, by then head of its legal department, he married Susan May Macnaghten (1908/9&#150;1964), daughter of Brigadier-General Ernest Brander Macnaghten; they had a son and a daughter. As secretary of the chairman's committee, he found himself in the centre of BAT's affairs, and judiciously worked with his autocratic chairman, Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen, aware that the company was regarded as a &#145;ponderous, unwieldy, old-fashioned English accounting machine&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 1.866). He became a director in 1943, deputy chairman in 1947, and vice-chairman in 1949. During the Second World War, though tobacco manufacturing was designated a reserved occupation for men over thirty, Oppenheim joined the Home Guard and combined his work for BAT with four nights a week as an air-raid warden.<br>
<br>When appointed chairman in 1953 (attributing his rapid rise to the untimely demise of more favoured candidates) Oppenheim strove to overturn the company's unfavourable image. His solution was to introduce a more collegiate style. Hiding his keen legal intellect behind an unassuming manner, he delegated day-to-day business to trusted subordinates. The management training centre he set up at Chelwood, Sussex, helped to knit the company together as many senior executives were widely scattered overseas. He took over just when BAT's business in China, which contributed a third of its earnings, was being expropriated, followed by the loss of the Egyptian market in 1956, after the revolution there. Oppenheim combated those setbacks by building up trade in the United States and Latin America, and transferring production from Britain to units overseas, run by local managers. He made a point of interesting himself in the working and housing conditions of employees throughout the world. In 1956 he acquired the overseas business, and valuable brands, of BAT's rival Benson and Hedges. Himself an occasional smoker, he faced the growing medical evidence of links with cancer by stressing the need for further research, but meanwhile found discussion of the issue &#145;unconstructive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). However, in 1961 he did begin a programme of diversification, successively purchasing Wiggins Teape, the paper manufacturer, Mardon Packaging International, Tonibell ice cream, and the Lenth&eacute;ric fragrance company. When he retired in 1966 the company's profits had risen from &pound;42 million to nearly &pound;102 million since 1953, while the level of dividends paid had more than trebled.<br>
<br>Oppenheim was concerned to modify the insular view of markets taken by British business leaders and politicians. He therefore became chairman of the British National Committee of International Chambers of Commerce (1963&#150;74) and of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1966&#150;71). In 1964 the Labour government began to penalize through tax measures UK companies receiving overseas income not fully offset by earnings in Britain. As chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's investment committee, he sponsored a report by Cambridge economists entitled <span class="italic">Effects of UK Direct Investment Overseas</span>. That report, acknowledging Oppenheim by name, found distinctive gains in exports from setting up plants abroad (contrary to the Labour government's claim that overseas investment destroyed British jobs). In 1960 he was knighted for services to industry.<br>
<br>Throughout his long life Oppenheim had an abiding interest in art. Having taken up painting at the age of five, he developed into a highly regarded artist, who created naturalistic works in oils, watercolour, and acrylic which were regularly hung in the Royal Academy's summer exhibition. During the Second World War he painted a number of German bombing incidents, several examples of which were acquired by the Imperial War Museum. From 1956 to 1972 he chaired the council of the Royal College of Art, which gained its royal charter in 1967. Two years later he was awarded the bicentenary medal of the Royal Society of Arts. He held one-man exhibitions at the Upper Grosvenor Galleries in 1971, Spinks in 1980 and 1983, and the New Grafton Gallery in 1985, 1988, and 1992.<br>
<br>After retiring from BAT Oppenheim became deputy chairman of the Commonwealth Development Finance Company, as well as being a director of Lloyds Bank and of the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society. As a keen sailor he was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. He served on the committee which transformed St John's Church, Smith Square, into a concert hall, and paid for the casing of the new organ installed there. A practical rather than an ideas man, he concerned himself with how things worked and could be improved. He agreeably summed up various facets of his character&#151;modesty, impatience with small talk on social occasions, and a subtle sense of humour&#151;in his reply to an importunate dinner partner who asked what his job had been: &#145;I was a tobacconist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>). He died of pneumonia at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, on 5 January 2003, and was survived by the son and daughter of his second marriage.<br>
