<span class="headword">Means,  Joseph Calrow</span>  (1801&#150;1879), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister</span>, was born in London on 20 May 1801, the only surviving child of John Means, a wine merchant in Rood Lane, London, and his wife, Phillis Simpson (<i>d</i>. 1814), the third daughter of John Simpson, preacher to the afternoon congregation of General Baptists at Worship Street. From 1809 he was educated in a day school, but on his mother's death he was enrolled at the boarding-school of the Revd John Evans (1767&#150;1827). He left this school in 1818 and entered his father's business as a clerk. Unhappy in commercial life, he became one of the original teachers of the Worship Street Sunday school. In 1822 he was baptized at Deptford and in 1823 he was elected to the committee of the General Baptist assembly. Turning his thoughts towards the ministry, he entered the classics and mathematics classes of the newly opened University College, London, in 1828, and at the same time studied theology in the General Baptist Academy under Benjamin Mardon.<br>
<br>In 1829, while still pursuing his studies, Means became preacher to the afternoon congregation at Worship Street. His ministry was successful, and his congregation moved later that year to Trinity Place, and subsequently to Coles Street, Southwark. In 1831 he was appointed secretary to the General Baptist assembly, a post he held with only two short breaks until 1872. He edited the organ of his denomination, the <span class="italic">General Baptist Advocate</span>, from 1831 to 1836. In 1834 he was elected a messenger, a quasi-episcopal office held for life. In 1836 he preached the annual sermon before the assembly, and caused a sensation by blaming the perceived decline among the Old Connexion of General Baptists on their repudiation of the atonement. The position which he held, and made clear during the sermon, was an evangelical one, and totally unacceptable to the majority of the assembly, who were inclined towards unitarianism. The strength of the reaction against him led Means to retire from his editorship of the <span class="italic">General Baptist Advocate</span>. After the publication of his volume on the atonement, <span class="italic">Jesus the Mercy Seat, or, A Scriptural View of Atonement</span> (1838), his connection with his congregation was severed in 1839. He formed a small evening congregation at Worship Street to which he ministered without stipend, supporting himself by literary work and by taking in boarders. He remained outside the denomination for four years.<br>
<br>In 1843 Means became minister of the General Baptist congregation at Chatham, Kent; his settlement was in the face of great opposition, but proved a very happy one. He was elected headmaster of the Chatham proprietary school, and kept it on when it was relinquished by the proprietors. In 1855 he succeeded Mardon as minister at Worship Street, and from this time he exerted a paramount influence on the counsels of his denomination. Means ceaselessly advocated closer union between the Old and New Connexions of General Baptists. His campaigning bore some fruit: the two bodies exchanged delegates over a period of about twenty years, beginning in 1868.<br>
<br>In 1837 Means married Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1878), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Robert Alcock; they had no children. He was never robust, and in later life he suffered greatly from asthma. He retired from the pastoral charge in October 1874, but returned again to many of its duties, preaching the last sermon (23 June 1878) at Worship Street before the removal of the congregation to new premises in Bethnal Green. He died on 6 February 1879 in his home at 21 New North Road, Hoxton.<br>
<br>Means's lucid contributions to theology were undervalued by his co-religionists; his position was a modified Arianism. His general literary work began in the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span>, to which he contributed topographical and other articles, including a biography of the Unitarian minister Lant Carpenter. He published a few separate sermons, and his addresses as messenger, often valuable for their historical details, are included in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the assembly. He wrote frequently on theological topics in the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, and in Baptist periodicals. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span> (4 vols., 1842&#150;4) published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and to William Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography</span> (3 vols., 1844&#150;9).<br>
