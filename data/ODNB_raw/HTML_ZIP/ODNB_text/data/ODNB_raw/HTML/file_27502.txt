<span class="headword">Tollet,  Elizabeth</span>  (1694&#150;1754), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 11 March 1694, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60262/', "George Tollet (d. 1719)")</script> and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cook (1659/60&#150;1702). Her father was a central influence in her early intellectual development; she probably spent her first seven or eight years in his residence in York Buildings, then lived with him in his house in the Tower of London into her adulthood. Early on, he, &#145;observing her extraordinary Genius, gave her so excellent an Education, that besides great Skill in Music, and Drawing, she spoke fluently and correctly the <i>Latin</i>, <i>Italian</i>, and <i>French</i> Languages; and well understood History, Poetry, and the Mathematicks&#146;  (preface to Tollet, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, i).<br>
<br>George Tollet was well acquainted with a number of the most prominent members of the intelligentsia of the day, including Samuel Pepys, John Evelyn, Edmond Halley, Isaac Newton, and Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, whom Elizabeth Tollet praises in her poem &#145;To my Brother at St. John's College in Cambridge&#146;. John Duncombe's biographical note on Elizabeth Tollet in John Nichols's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Poems</span> (1780) states that &#145;Sir Isaac Newton honoured both [George Tollet] and his daughter with his friendship, and was much pleased with some of her first essays&#146;  (6.64n.). From 1699 until his death in 1727 Newton was master of the mint, which was then within the precincts of the Tower of London. Although Elizabeth likely presented these &#145;first essays&#146; to him during her years in the Tower, the family's acquaintance with Newton might date as far back as 1693, when, in preparation for a projected national lottery, Samuel Pepys corresponded with Newton and George Tollet on the nature of probabilities.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Tollet seems to have attained considerable literary proficiency even as a teenager, since Thomas Parnell's poem &#145;To a Young Lady, on her Translation of the Story of Phoebus and Daphne, from Ovid&#146;&#151;published initially in Steele's <span class="italic">Poetical Miscellanies</span> (December 1713)&#151;is almost certainly in praise of Tollet's poem &#145;Apollo and Daphne&#146;, which must therefore have been written by 1713, when she could have been no older than nineteen. In 1724 a book of her poetry appeared anonymously&#151;<span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions. With Anne Boleyn to King Henry VIII. An Epistle</span>&#151;published in London by John Clarke. Eighty-four pages in length, the slim duodecimo volume contains, in addition to the long title poem, several imitations of Horace, Ovid, and Virgil; a handful of Latin verse; poems to friends, such as the harpsichordist Elizabeth Blackler, and poems on famous contemporary writers such as William Congreve, Alexander Pope, Anne Finch, countess of Winchilsea, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, as well as other poems demonstrating striking artistic and intellectual range. Especially interesting to recent scholars is Tollet's poem &#145;Hypatia&#146;, a polemic of nearly 200 lines in which Tollet has the &#145;Shade&#146; of the ancient female mathematician&#150;philosopher Hypatia argue&#151;against &#145;Tyrant Custom&#146;&#151;that women have the right to better education and to freedom of intellectual enquiry of diverse kinds&#151;including scientific, classical, and theological. References to the inappropriateness of &#145;<i>L&#151;&#151;s</i>' Spleen&#146; and the inadequacy of &#145;<i>Toland</i>'s Praise&#146; in line 14 suggest Tollet's poem is in part a response to Thomas Lewis's <span class="italic">History of Hypatia</span> (1721) and the substantial third section, &#145;Hypatia&#146;, of John Toland's <span class="italic">Tetradymus</span> (1720).<br>
<br>Evidence from book subscription lists suggests Tollet probably lived in the Tower for some years after her father's retirement to Betley, Staffordshire. At his death in 1719 he left her &#145;a handsome Fortune&#146;  (preface to Tollet, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, i): this included an annuity of &pound;250, among other legacies. She later lived in Stratford, Essex, where she was associated with &#145;the Stratford-le-Bow school&#146;, and spent her last years in Westham (now West Ham), Essex. She died, unmarried, on 1 February 1754 and was buried in All Saints, West Ham, on 11 February. Her epitaph, now worn beyond legibility, once claimed<blockquote>
<div>Religion, Justice, and Benevolence,<br>
</div>
<div>Appeared in all her Actions;<br>
</div>
<div>And her Poems, in various Languages,<br>
</div>
<div>Are adorn'd with extensive Learning,<br>
</div>
<div>Applied to the best Purposes.<br>
</div> (Toldervy, 2.230)</blockquote>Clues to the contents of her library may be found in her poems, her will, book subscription lists (as indexed in the <span class="italic">Biography Database</span> CD-ROM), and Hodgson's <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Betley Hall Library</span> (1923).<br>
<br>William Cole described Tollet as &#145;a little, crooked woman, but a sharp wit&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 8.584), but no portraits appear to be extant.<br>
<br>During her lifetime several of Tollet's poems were circulated in manuscript, and some saw periodical and miscellany publication, but it seems it was only after her death that any poem appeared under her name in print. Tollet's writings were entrusted to her chief executor, Colonel Richard King. She had in her will stated that she wanted posthumous publication of &#145;my Writings in Verse together with those already printed by Mr. Clark at the Royal Exchange that they may be published entire and without mixture of other Hands those in prose being wrote for private use&#146;. At 238 pages, a considerably expanded edition of her poems, bearing the same title as that of the 1724 edition, appeared in 1755. In this posthumous volume, ascribed to &#145;Mrs. Elizabeth Tollet&#146; by the title-page, there are many additional poems, including several concerning further contemporary artists or intellectuals such as Charles Jervas, Dr John Woodward, and Isaac Newton; over thirty renderings of psalms into English verse; as well as a &#145;musical drama&#146; entitled &#145;Susanna; or, Innocence Preserv'd&#146;, which elaborates the apocryphal story of Susanna and the Elders from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. The book also includes further Latin verses, and several poems which draw on recent scientific thought in their theological argumentation, the most elaborate of these being &#145;The Microcosm&#146;. The text of the 1755 Clarke edition was later reissued by the publisher Thomas Lownds <i>c</i>.1756&#150;60.<br>
<br>Tollet's work was anthologized by Henry Dell, in whose <span class="italic">Select Collection of the Psalms of David</span> (1756) Tollet, with twenty-nine psalm renderings, is by far the most well-represented author, by John Duncombe in John Nichols's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Poems</span> (1780), and by Robert Southey (1807), Alexander Dyce (1825), and Frederic Rowton (1848), among others. She was rediscovered by Roger Lonsdale and included in his influential 1980s anthologies of eighteenth-century verse, since when scholars such as Isobel Grundy in <span class="italic">Halcyon</span> and Deborah Baker Wyrick in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Literary Biography</span> have called for Tollet's &#145;reinscription&#146; into literary history, citing her importance as an early feminist and overlooked poetic voice of the period; and Tollet's work has been further and quite widely anthologized.<br>
