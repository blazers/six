<span class="headword">Charlot,  (Eugene) Andr&eacute; Maurice</span>  (1882&#150;1956), <span class="occ">theatrical impresario</span>, was born in Paris on 26 July 1882, the eldest of three children of Jules Charles Maurice Charlot (1858&#150;1917), whose father, Auguste, had won the first prix Rome for composition in 1850, and his wife, Jeanne Sargine Battu (1858&#150;1934), the well-off daughter of a Geneva goldsmith. From his earliest days Charlot had an English governess. Having gladly failed his exams at the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet, he enrolled at the Paris Conservatoire but in 1899, offered a job by his father, then a theatre manager, Charlot took up a new career. By 1902 he was writing theatrical news and gossip for Parisian magazines and travelling to London to sign talent for the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Ch&acirc;telet. His first-hand acquaintance with revue began in 1905, as assistant manager of the Palais Royal. In 1908 Charlot joined the Folies-Berg&egrave;re as business manager.<br>
<br>In 1909, Charlot married the English dancer Florence Gladman (1891&#150;1956); they had two children. That same year he joined the theatrical agents Sherek and Braff, shortly afterwards opening the firm's New York office. In 1910 he opened his own agency in Paris, and was soon supplying revue and music-hall talent&#151;notably the <i>femme fatale</i> Gaby Deslys&#151;to the huge Alhambra Theatre in Leicester Square, London. Under the wing of actor&#150;entrepreneur George Grossmith the younger, he became manager (briefly co-manager, with Montague Leveaux) at the Alhambra, where between 1912 and 1914 his spectacular shows, adapting the gossipy conventions of French revue for English sensibilities, duelled ably with the immense, American-style revues of Albert de Courville. Charlot quickly influenced the British stage, importing the scenic artists Marc Henri and Laverdet and the work of couturiers Paul Poiret, Jean Patou, and Lucien Lelong, as well as identifying bright new performing talents such as Beatrice Lillie, destined for four decades of fame as &#145;the funniest woman on earth&#146;.<br>
<br>The surprising 1914 success of one of Charles Cochran's bare-bones revues helped convince Charlot that the genre's immediate future lay in taking audiences' minds off the war with humour, panache, economy, and a non-intrusive intimacy. At smaller houses&#151;notably the Vaudeville&#151;he gradually made intimate revue his own: aside from undefinable &#145;style&#146;, the Charlot form featured a small orchestra, a chorus of no more than eight who could sing, dance, and play sketches, no more than six principals, a reliance upon evocative lighting rather than opulent settings, and plenty of bright, topical &#145;blackout&#146; playlets of 5&#150;7 minutes. Charlot soon developed the future stars of the British musical stage&#151;Lillie, Gertrude Lawrence, Jack Buchanan, Phyllis Monkman, Jack Hulbert, Jessie Matthews&#151;as well as sketch-writers Ronald Jeans and Dion Titheradge and composers Ivor Novello and Philip Braham. The lengthy run of <span class="italic">Buzz Buzz</span> (1918&#150;20) confirmed Charlot as a genius of revue.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A to Z</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">London Calling</span> (1923, the first revue whose songs and sketches were largely written by No&euml;l Coward) were more skilled and sophisticated. It was characteristic of Charlot's patriarchal approach that, having first failed Coward at an audition, he incorporated a Coward song into a 1918 revue and, after the young man had begun to make a playwriting name, assigned Jeans, by now a safe pair of hands, to work with him on <span class="italic">London Calling</span>. In 1922, the year of his naturalization as a British subject, Charlot co-produced London's first publicly staged cabaret. A tall, beguiling man who preferred to spend money on gracious living&#151;particularly Lanson champagne&#151;rather than salaries, Charlot momentarily solved the problem of losing his stars to higher bidders by fusing the best bits of earlier shows and taking Lillie, Lawrence, and Buchanan to New York, where <span class="italic">Charlot's London Revue</span> opened in January 1924.<br>
<br>The impact of <span class="italic">Charlot's Revue</span> was immediate and historic. In America the gigantic revues perfected by Florenz Ziegfeld did not survive the decade. American success made <span class="italic">Charlot's Revue</span> the toast of London. But Charlot was unable to build upon his success; there followed a series of impoverishing American set-backs. A new version of <span class="italic">Charlot's London Revue</span> in early 1926 foundered on a tour, and later that year a disastrous lapse of judgement paired Charlot's lighthearted approach with that of the raunchiest of American producers, Earl Carroll. In 1928, back in England, his fortunes briefly rallied with radio's first revue, <span class="italic">Charlot's Hour</span>; its postbag (24,000 letters at its closing) was the largest so far in the BBC's short history. Although later ventures, including the experimental musical play <span class="italic">Wonder Bar</span> (1930), were critically praised, Charlot's moment had passed; he briefly worked for Alexander Korda's film company and took bankruptcy in 1931.<br>
<br>In 1933 Charlot's comeback revues recaptured the old genial spirit. Another radio series was well received in England and France. But the general theatrical depression of the mid-1930s forced him into a degrading sequence of semi-nude &#145;non-stop revues&#146;. In debt and in poor health, Charlot, an imperious man (his disciple Robert Nesbitt called him &#145;magisterial&#146;) whose confidence often faltered, left Britain for good in 1937, and travelled to southern California, where he was convinced he could start a new career. His timing was unusually poor; an even more intimate form of revue, created by Herbert Farjeon and Norman Marshall&#151;its chorus removed, its orchestra replaced by a piano, and its satire sharpened&#151;was under way at the Little Theatre and the Gate. Thus renewed, British revue prospered for the next two decades.<br>
<br>After an unsatisfying stint as technical adviser for Paramount Pictures, Charlot enlisted the Hollywood &#145;British colony&#146; and a host of American film stars for <span class="italic">Charlot's War Relief Revue</span> (1940). This success led nowhere and Charlot turned to teaching. Acting as comp&egrave;re for his &#145;revuettes&#146; in a tiny theatre on Sunset Boulevard, he was &#145;spotted&#146; by one of his own stage discoveries, now a successful director, who persuaded him to take up motion picture acting. Between 1941 and 1954 Charlot, who became an American citizen in 1944, appeared in more than three dozen films, often uncredited and usually as an all-purpose European. Perhaps his most memorable role was the fearsomely condemning cardinal in <span class="italic">The Song of Bernadette</span> (1941). He continued to repackage his material in the hope of making a theatrical comeback or television d&eacute;but. He had completed a book of reminiscences and was working with Rowland Leigh on a musical comedy script when he died in Hollywood on 20 May 1956; he was buried there on 25 May.<br>
