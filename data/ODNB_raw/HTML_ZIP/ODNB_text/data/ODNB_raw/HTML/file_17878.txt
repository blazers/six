<span class="headword">Malet,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1066&#150;1105), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the eldest son of the Anglo-Norman landowner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17880/', "William Malet (d. 1071?)")</script> and Esilia, daughter of Gilbert Crispin. He was an adult by 1066 and succeeded his father on the latter's death, probably in 1071. The Malet lands in Normandy lay in the Caennais and the Pays de Caux, where their chief castle was at Graville. In England by 1086 Robert Malet had land in eight counties from Surrey to Yorkshire and was among the dozen richest lay landowners. Four-fifths of his wealth lay in east Suffolk, where his father had made Eye the centre of the estate.<br>
<br>In 1075 Malet took a leading part in suppressing the Bretons who rebelled against William I in East Anglia, and occupied Norwich Castle for the king in the aftermath of the revolt. He was sheriff of Suffolk in 1080. He may have supported Robert Curthose's attempt to win the English crown in 1088 and was certainly out of favour with William II, who took the honour of Eye away from him, no later than 1094, and gave it to Roger the Poitevin. Malet disappears entirely from the historical record during William Rufus's reign: probably he went to Normandy and supported Curthose until the latter went on crusade in 1096. Eventually he attached himself to the king's brother Henry and was with him when he was crowned in England in 1100. Shortly afterwards Malet recovered the honour of Eye. He became Henry I's chamberlain and occupied a central place at court for the next five years, witnessing many royal charters. In later years he was regarded as the first occupant of the new office of master chamberlain. His latest dated appearance on a witness list was in February 1105. Probably between 1100 and 1105 he completed the foundation of a priory at Eye, a project which he had begun before 1087 but which had been interrupted during Roger the Poitevin's ownership of the estate.<br>
<br>Malet's marriages and offspring are uncertain. A much altered copy of a charter names his wife as Maud, but a Robert Malet and his wife, Emmeline, gave land to the abbey of St Taurin at &Eacute;vreux for the support of their son Hugh, a monk there. Malet may have had other sons called William and Robert, though the William Malet who succeeded him in Normandy has generally been regarded as his brother. Eye and the rest of his English lands passed on his death to Henry I, who in 1113 gave them to Stephen of Blois (later King Stephen).<br>
