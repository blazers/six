<span class="headword">Lusignan <span class="st"> [Valence]</span>,  Aymer  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1228&#150;1260), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was one of the younger sons of Hugues (X), count of La Marche, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14483/', "Isabella of Angoul&#234;me (d. 1246)")</script>, the widow of King John.<h2>
<a name="Thekingshalfbrother"></a>The king's half-brother</h2>Aymer de Lusignan was born in Poitou, probably at the family stronghold of Valence near Angoul&ecirc;me, and in 1242 was promised the lordship of Couh&eacute;, a small portion of his family's Poitevin estate. As a younger son he may already have been destined for a career in the church. As early as July 1242, when he can have been no more than fifteen years old, his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12950/', "Henry III")</script> attempted to present him to the church of Northfleet in Kent. In June 1246 he was successfully presented to the church of Tisbury in Wiltshire by the king, and in the summer of 1247 he took up residence in England together with his brothers Guy, Geoffrey, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29481/', "William de Valence")</script>. Through royal favour he received a rich haul of benefices, including the churches of Wearmouth and Chester-le-Street in the diocese of Durham, Kirkham in Lancashire, Blakeney in Norfolk, Deddington in Oxfordshire, and St Helen, Abingdon, the prebends of Holme in York Minster and Oxgate in St Paul's Cathedral, London, and pensions of 10 marks a year from the abbeys of Crowland and St Albans. The chroniclers allege that the king demanded a pension for Lusignan from every abbey and priory in England. From July 1247 until at least the following September he was in residence at the schools of Oxford, supported there by the king and studying under a tutor named Master Vincent, canon and later archbishop of Tours. At much the same time the Paris grammarian Master John Garland composed a commentary, intended to instruct Lusignan in the rudiments of grammar.<br>
<br>Aymer de Lusignan's residence at Oxford was marred by the murder of one of his servants, leading to the suspension of the city's privileges by the crown between November 1247 and January 1248. In 1247 the king attempted unsuccessfully to have Lusignan promoted as provost of Beverley Minster, and in 1249 the monks of Durham rejected a proposal that he be elected their bishop. During these same years he continued to spend time in Poitou. In August 1248 he was appointed one of the executors of his father, and in March 1249 he did homage to the abbot of St Maixent for his estate at Couh&eacute;. Following the death on 1 September 1250 of William of Raleigh, bishop of Winchester, in the following November the king commanded the monks of St Swithun's Priory to elect Lusignan as their bishop, and preached a lengthy sermon in Winchester Cathedral, reminding the monks of their special obligation to the crown. Although reluctant to elect a candidate who was manifestly lacking in age or experience, the monks capitulated and Lusignan was elected on 4 November. After special lobbying by the king, his election was confirmed by the pope in January 1251 and shortly afterwards he was provided with papal dispensation, allowing him to remain unconsecrated as bishop and to continue to enjoy the income from his other ecclesiastical benefices, estimated by the chronicler Matthew Paris, an inveterate critic of Lusignan, as being in excess of 1000 marks a year. He returned to England in June 1251 and on 23 July was received at Winchester with a splendid feast, being provided with a set of costly vestments and chapel furnishings by the king.<h2>
<a name="Quarrelsandcontroversies"></a>Quarrels and controversies</h2>Aymer de Lusignan's years as bishop-elect were to be marked by violent controversy. Soon after his return, in September 1251, he became involved in a dispute with the merchants of Southampton over their refusal to suspend trading during the period of the great Winchester fair, a dispute which was to be protracted until 1254. More seriously, in November 1252, following attacks by the official of the archbishop of Canterbury on the prior of St Thomas's Hospital, Southwark, Lusignan incited various of his supporters, including his brother William de Valence, to make a violent raid upon the archbishop's houses at Lambeth and Maidstone and to carry off the archbishop's official to imprisonment at Farnham Castle. The official was later released, but the archbishop, Boniface of Savoy (<i>d</i>. 1270), issued a sentence of excommunication against Lusignan and his supporters, which was not lifted until January 1253 following interventions by the king and an appeal to the papacy. Later that same year Lusignan became embroiled in an equally fierce dispute with the monks of his cathedral convent at Winchester, inspired by his claims to supervise the appointment of the prior of St Swithun's, to nominate his own candidates to subsidiary offices within the priory, and by his insistence that the monastic obedientiaries render accounts for their offices before the episcopal exchequer at Wolvesey Palace. The monks, led by their prior, William of Taunton, appealed against Lusignan to the pope, leading to the temporary imprisonment of various members of the convent, and the exile of various of Lusignan's opponents to other English Benedictine houses.<br>
<br>In June 1256 the dispute was temporarily healed, following mediation by Pope Alexander IV and the English Franciscan Adam Marsh (<i>d</i>. 1259). However, the hostility between monks and bishops was by no means resolved. To fund their appeal the monks had been forced to borrow heavily from Italian merchants, so that in return for repaying some of these debts, Lusignan persuaded the monks to sell him the Isle of Portland with the manors of Weymouth and Wyke in Dorset. Throughout these years he continued to receive a stream of gifts, wine, venison, and timber, from Henry III. His profits from the Winchester fair were boosted by royal trading privileges, and new markets were awarded by the king to at least three of Lusignan's episcopal estates. Lusignan himself speculated in the lucrative market in Jewish debt, and obtained the king's permission to purchase land at Woolwich and Greenwich from the monks of St Jean-d'Ang&eacute;ly in his native Poitou. Through royal favour he was able to marry his niece Alice to Gilbert de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1295), son of the earl of Gloucester, and for several years in succession he was granted exemption from hunting offences in the king's forests. In 1255 the king lobbied unsuccessfully to have him promoted archbishop of York.<h2>
<a name="Thepenaltiesoffavouritism"></a>The penalties of favouritism</h2>Lusignan was not entirely subservient to the royal court. In April 1253, for example, he supported the other English bishops in their resistance to a demand for taxation, an action for which he is said to have been bitterly rebuked by the king. Perhaps as a result of this, and in the aftermath of his dispute with Archbishop Boniface, by July 1253 Lusignan's enemies had persuaded the pope to rescind the earlier licence by which he had been allowed to retain the ecclesiastical rents and benefices he held in addition to his income from Winchester. At a time of ever mounting financial crisis, the promotion of Aymer and his Lusignan brothers was widely resented in England. His dispute with Archbishop Boniface demonstrates the extent to which the Lusignans were also at odds with the king's supporters and kinsmen from Savoy, including not only Boniface himself, but also Boniface's niece, Queen Eleanor, Henry III's wife. Aymer de Lusignan and his brothers were widely criticized as Poitevin outsiders, an image enhanced by their continuing contacts with France and Poitou. Many of the clerks and knights in Lusignan's episcopal household were drawn from Poitou, and he himself spent long periods overseas&#151;between January and September 1257 on a visit to his homeland, in January 1257 as ambassador sent to negotiate a truce with Louis IX, and in January 1258 as an envoy to request the restoration of Henry III's lands in France.<br>
<br>The outcry against Lusignan reached its climax during a parliament summoned to Oxford in June 1258. Two months earlier his men had been involved in a violent clash with the followers of John Fitzgeoffrey (<i>d</i>. 1258), lord of Shere in Surrey, in which one of Fitzgeoffrey's men was killed. Henry III had refused to give a hearing to Fitzgeoffrey's complaints, fuelling an armed resistance to the crown headed by the English barons. In the ensuing turmoil Lusignan was appointed one of the twelve royalists sent to negotiate with the baronial opposition, but shortly afterwards, at the end of June 1258, he and his brothers fled from the Oxford parliament to Winchester. The barons pursued them there, and threatened to lay siege to Lusignan's castle at Wolvesey. He was accused of homicide, following the death of Fitzgeoffrey's servant, and dark rumours circulated of a poison plot against various of the English barons. Offered the choice between remaining in England, in baronial custody, and accepting exile overseas, Lusignan chose exile, so that he and his brothers set sail from Dover on 14 July. He was permitted to carry away with him only 3000 marks of his vast accumulated treasure; the remainder was spent by the barons over the next two years, partly in attempts to persuade the pope to remove Lusignan from his office as bishop of Winchester.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsdeathandreputation"></a>Last years, death, and reputation</h2>Initially Lusignan intended to reside at the schools of Paris, but he was refused permission by the French king, Louis IX, brother-in-law of Henry III's wife, Eleanor of Provence. Instead he travelled to the papal court. There he obtained a favourable hearing, and in January 1259 the papal penitentiary Velascus was dispatched to persuade Henry III to restore Lusignan to his see. Prompted by the barons the king replied that the bishop's exile had been justified, and that Lusignan had done much to sour relations between Henry, Queen Eleanor, and their son, the Lord Edward. Meanwhile, in January 1259, the Winchester monks had been persuaded to elect Henry of Wingham (<i>d</i>. 1262) as bishop in Lusignan's place. The Winchester estates were plundered by the barons, and Lusignan's appointees ejected from their offices in the cathedral by the monks of St Swithun's. In January 1260 Henry III wrote again to the pope, asking that Lusignan might be translated to another bishopric, outside England. Despite this, having reached the canonical age of thirty, on 29 May 1260 Lusignan was ordained priest by the pope, and on the following day was consecrated bishop of Winchester. He then set out for England, accompanied by Velascus and by his former tutor, Vincent, archbishop of Tours, who was empowered to declare a papal sentence of interdict and excommunication until the Winchester estates should be restored. However, at Paris Lusignan became ill, and died at the abbey of Ste Genevi&egrave;ve on 4 December 1260. On receiving news of his death King Henry ordered that special masses be said, and feasts celebrated in his honour at Winchester and Oxford. Two years later, no longer constrained by the baronial council, Henry commissioned a further series of feasts and prayers to mark the burial of Lusignan's heart at Winchester Cathedral, on 20 March 1262.<br>
<br>In his lifetime Aymer de Lusignan was heavily criticized by the English chroniclers, for his foreign birth, his greed, his lack of learning, and his encouragement of violence. The dispute with St Swithun's Priory, which first erupted in 1254, was to continue to plague his successors at Winchester for many years to come, resulting in a financial crisis for both bishops and monks. However, despite this, and despite the fact that for much of his time as bishop-elect Lusignan was an absentee from Winchester, his episcopal administration appears to have operated with considerable efficiency. He or his officials issued numerous charters, ordaining vicarages, settling tithe disputes, encouraging gifts to the Winchester hospital of St Cross, and ending a dispute over jurisdiction with the archdeacon of Surrey. The Winchester account rolls demonstrate a high level of alms-giving to the poor during his years as bishop-elect. Despite his supposed lack of learning Lusignan was still able to serve as one of the judges in the literary contest between the poets Henry d'Avranches and Michael of Cornwall. Through his speculations in the land market he obtained possession of Portland in Dorset and an estate at Woolwich in Kent, originally intended to augment the revenues of the see of Winchester, but in the event seized by Lusignan's baronial opponents following his exile. Most remarkably of all, his heart tomb at Winchester, decorated with the arms of Lusignan, of Henry III, and of Henry's brother, Richard, earl of Cornwall, king of Germany (<i>d</i>. 1272), appears to have been venerated as a shrine. Miracles are said to have occurred there in the immediate aftermath of his heart's burial in 1262, and money, presumably votive offerings, was still being collected from the tomb more than a decade later.<br>
