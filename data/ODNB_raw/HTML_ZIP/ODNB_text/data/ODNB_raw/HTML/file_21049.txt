<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oxenden,  Ashton</span>  (1808&#150;1892), <span class="occ">bishop of Montreal</span>, sixth son of Sir Henry Oxenden, seventh baronet (1756&#150;1838), and Mary, daughter of Colonel Graham of St Lawrence, near Canterbury, was born at Barham, Broome Park, Canterbury, on 20 September 1808. He had six brothers and five sisters.<br>
<br>Educated at Ramsgate School and at Harrow School (with H. E. Manning and Christopher Wordsworth), Oxenden matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 9 June 1826, graduated BA in 1831, MA in 1859, and was created DD 10 July 1869. At university he neglected his work to hunt and play cricket. In December 1833 he was ordained to the curacy of Barham, Kent, where he introduced weekly cottage lectures and tried to enliven the services. His parish work ruined his health and he spent much of the decade from 1838 travelling on the continent. From 1849 to 1869 he was rector of Pluckley with Pevington, Kent, and in 1864 was made an honorary canon of Canterbury Cathedral. On 14 June 1864 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of Joseph Hoare Bradshaw, a London banker; they had a daughter, Mary. At Pluckley he first began extemporaneous preaching. He published his cottage lectures as the popular <span class="italic">Barham Tracts</span>, followed by the <span class="italic">Pluckley Tracts</span>, 116 pamphlets in all.<br>
<br>In May 1869 Oxenden was elected&#151;as a compromise candidate between the evangelicals and the Tractarians&#151;bishop of Montreal and metropolitan of Canada by the Canadian provincial synod. He was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 1 August, and installed in Montreal Cathedral on 5 September. Three-quarters of the population of the city were Roman Catholics, but the Church of England possessed twelve churches there besides the cathedral. Oxenden presided over nine dioceses. He assiduously attended to his episcopal duties, generally living in Montreal during the winter and visiting the country districts in the summer. <span class="italic">My First Year in Canada</span> (1871) was written to raise funds for the diocese. He considerably increased the number of clergy, but found his time much taken up by rows about ritualism. Ill health caused his resignation of the bishopric in 1878.<br>
<br>On his return to England Oxenden attended the Pan-Anglican synod and then moved to southern France, acting as chaplain at Cannes, 1878&#150;9. From 30 May 1879 to 1884 he was vicar of St Stephen's, near Canterbury, and from 1879 to 1884 he officiated as rural dean of Canterbury. In 1891 he wrote <span class="italic">The History of my Life</span>, the last of his many works which had made him one of the best-selling clerical authors of his time. He was a master of the plain but lively exposition of Christian principles. Oxenden died at Chalet Esperance, Biarritz, France, on 22 February 1892.<br>
