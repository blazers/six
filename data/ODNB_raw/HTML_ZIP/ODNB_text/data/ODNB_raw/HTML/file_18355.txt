<span class="headword">Mauclerk,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1248), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, is of unknown origins. It seems unlikely that he is to be identified with a namesake, one of the sons of Girard Mauclerk, active in property transactions at Rouen as early as 1176. He may, however, have been related to another royal clerk, Robert Mauclerk, resident in Nottinghamshire, who in the 1190s had joined the rebellion of John, count of Mortain, the future king. Walter Mauclerk is recorded in 1218 holding the prebend of Woodborough in Southwell Minster, and at a later date as witness to various private charters in Nottinghamshire&#151;facts which go some way towards substantiating a family link to the north midlands. One of his brothers, named &#145;R&#146;, was prior of Reading Abbey, and in 1214 was proposed unsuccessfully as the king's candidate for the vacant abbey of St Albans. A kinsman or nephew, named Ralph Barri, possibly related to the Barry family of Nottinghamshire, was appointed prior of Carlisle during Mauclerk's years as bishop, and another (unnamed) nephew was seeking promotion to the church of Arnold near Nottingham about the year 1220. Mauclerk's father, named &#145;W&#146;, was later commemorated in gifts to the bishopric of Carlisle.<br>
<br>First recorded in 1202, as a clerk of King John's chamber involved in financial operations in Normandy, Mauclerk was promoted in the same year to the Norman church of Falaise, but following the collapse of Plantagenet power in France, joined the king in England, where John presented him to the churches of Croxton in Lincolnshire, Kings Nympton in Devon, and Mylor in Cornwall, and to a vicarage at Catfield in Norfolk, a pension in the diocese of Exeter, and the custody of various royal wards. As the king's confidential clerk, he was appointed joint sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1204, and travelled to Ireland in 1210 and 1212, perhaps in the following of John de Gray (<i>d</i>. 1214), royal justiciar in Ireland and bishop of Norwich, two of whose charters were witnessed by Mauclerk. In 1214 he accompanied the English military expeditions to Poitou and Flanders, and in the following year he appeared at the papal court, reporting to the king on the progress made by the rival baronial and royal proctors in Rome. In 1218 he served as royal justice in eyre in the east midlands, and in 1221 he was promoted to joint custody of the king's forests throughout England. From 1222 he served as sheriff of Cumberland, and it may be that it was the local power acquired with this office that enabled him, in the following year, to stake a claim to the vacant see of Carlisle. He was elected bishop by the canons of Carlisle before 22 August 1223, when his election received royal assent. Shortly afterwards the king appointed a proctor to oppose Mauclerk before the papal court, suggesting a temporary breach in relations; but on 26 October royal assent was renewed and Mauclerk's temporalities were restored.<br>
<br>As bishop of Carlisle, Mauclerk remained active in royal service. In 1225 he spent several months in Cologne, attempting to arrange a marriage between Henry III and a daughter of the duke of Austria, a mission in which he claimed to have endured shipwreck and great hardship. While abroad he consecrated a shrine in the collegiate church of the Holy Apostles at Cologne. Two years later he was sent to Poitou, and in the same year he is said to have been engaged in fruitless attempts to persuade the knights of Normandy and Brittany to abandon their allegiance to the king of France. He served as constable of Newcastle in 1228, and in the same year was promoted to be treasurer of the king's exchequer, assuming office on about 13 November. In the summer of 1232, amid the upheaval brought about at court through the influence of Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1238), Mauclerk received royal letters guaranteeing him life custody of the treasury, and of the castle and county of Carlisle, but despite this, he was deposed from office in January 1233, deprived of the manor of Melbourne, Derbyshire, which had also been guaranteed to him for life, and forced to fine &pound;1000 to retain his other lands and liberties. Disgraced at court, he sought to go into exile overseas, but was detained by the king's bailiffs at Dover and roughly handled. The English bishops pronounced a sentence of excommunication against his assailants, and Mauclerk was allowed to retire to Flanders, from where he appears to have issued a sentence of his own, placing the cathedral and city of Carlisle under interdict.<br>
<br>Mauclerk was reconciled to court in the following year and, with the fall of Peter des Roches, assumed a leading role in the king's council. In 1235 he headed an embassy to Flanders, charged with arranging a marriage between Henry III and a daughter of the count of Ponthieu. In 1236 he was restored to custody of Carlisle Castle, and two years later fined 600 marks a year to have the county of Westmorland and the heir of John de Vieuxpont in wardship. During the king's continental expedition of 1242&#150;3 he served as one of the principal members of the regency council set to govern England, and over the next few years he was engaged in peace negotiations with Scotland, and in a lucrative trade in royal wardships. With papal licence, he resigned the see of Carlisle on 29 June 1246, in order to enter the Dominican order at Oxford, a move inspired by piety and by advancing age and decrepitude. None the less, as a former bishop he continued to exercise episcopal functions, being appointed by Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1253), to provide the blessing of newly elected heads of houses at Leicester and Godstow, and in May 1248 issuing an episcopal indulgence on behalf of the relics of Westminster Abbey. He died at Oxford on about 28 October 1248, leaving substantial benefactions to the Oxford Blackfriars. As bishop of Carlisle, he did much to improve the finances of his see, purchasing the soke of Horncastle in Lincolnshire together with numerous subsidiary liberties obtained through royal favour. In addition he obtained a life interest in the royal manor of Melbourne and the manor of Dalston in Cumberland as a gift from the crown. Most of this property, together with his houses in London and an estate at Salkeld, near Penrith, he bequeathed in perpetuity to the bishopric of Carlisle. Given his later contacts with the Dominican order, it is possible that it was Mauclerk who in 1233 helped to establish houses of Dominican and Franciscan friars in Carlisle. However, his chief talent appears to have lain in finance, rather than in scholarship or works of piety.<br>
