<span class="headword">Walker,  Thomas</span>  (1749&#150;1817), <span class="occ">cotton merchant and political reformer</span>, was born on 3 April 1749 in Manchester, the eldest son of a local merchant who originally lived in Bristol. Although very little is known of Walker's childhood, it was during these formative years that he became acquainted with the writings of Rousseau, Hume, Locke, and Voltaire. It was, however, James Burgh, the radical schoolmaster, and in particular his treatise <span class="italic">Political Disquisitions</span>, that was to have the most important influence on Walker's mind during these early years. Indeed, Walker recalled in 1794 that Burgh was &#145;an able writer, endeared to me, as the instructor of my youth&#146;  (Walker, 5). In 1775 Walker married Hannah Shore, with whom he had three daughters and three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28513/', "Thomas Walker (1784&#150;1836)")</script>, police magistrate and author. <br>
<br>Through his marriage, Walker came to know the Unitarian gentleman of Derbyshire Samuel Shore, his wife's brother, who, as an associate of Christopher Wyvill and a member of the Society of the Friends of the People, perhaps first aroused Walker's interest in reform politics. Walker quickly became a prominent figure in Manchester's community and politics, serving as an adviser on numerous local boards during the 1770s and 1780s, including that of the Manchester Infirmary, where the dissenter Dr Thomas Percival was a physician. As an outspoken protectionist, Walker earned national fame in 1785 when he successfully led a local campaign to oppose the government's introduction a year earlier of a fustian tax. That same year he founded the General Chamber of Manufactures, incorporated to fight William Pitt's Irish trade arrangements, and in 1786 he was a vocal opponent of the Eden&#150;Vergennes treaty. By the end of 1787 Walker had become chairman of a Manchester anti-slavery committee, holding the post for several years. These efforts endeared him to many leading Foxite whigs, especially the earl of Derby, who became godfather to one of Walker's sons and who sponsored Walker's election to the Whig Club in 1788. Walker was also associated with the Manchester Revolution Society and on 1 February 1788 he became a member of the Society for Constitutional Information.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the French Revolution Walker was elected a steward of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96833', "London Revolution Society")</script>, and on 22 January 1790 he joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, founded by Thomas Percival, but resigned at the end of 1791 after the society refused to offer their sympathies to Priestley following the riots of July. In October 1790 Walker became borough reeve of Manchester, a position he found beneficial in the early days of the Manchester Constitutional Society, which he helped organize on 5 October 1790. With Walker as president of the society moderate parliamentary reform was its primary objective, and, despite the Anglican persuasion of its founder, the society advocated equality for dissenters in the light of ongoing and increasing repression and intimidation.<br>
<br>Walker's political activities attracted conservative attention and loyalist reprisal. In November 1790 at a dinner meeting of the Manchester Revolution Society, Walker clashed with William Roberts, a tory lawyer and American &eacute;migr&eacute;, who subsequently published a handbill that led to charges of libel being laid, albeit unsuccessfully, against Walker. Within a year he had helped establish the <span class="italic">Manchester Herald</span> and his house became a rendezvous for reformers after they were excluded from local taverns and public houses. On 11 December 1792, however, Walker's house on South Parade and the offices of the <span class="italic">Manchester Herald</span> were besieged by a &#145;church and king&#146; mob. By June 1793 the Manchester Constitutional Society was dissolved when legal action commenced against him. Manchester authorities and loyalists had bribed an Irish weaver and local radical named Thomas Dunn to give false evidence against Walker and, despite failing to indict him of high treason, he and nine other Manchester reformers were charged with conspiring to overthrow the king, constitution, and government. Walker, who employed the defence of Thomas Erskine and Felix Vaughan, was tried at Lancaster assizes on 2 April 1794, but he was acquitted largely on account of Dunn's perjury. He was similarly exonerated on the same day on a separate charge of damning the king.<br>
<br>Despite writing and publishing <span class="italic">A review of some of the political events which have occurred in Manchester during the last five years</span> (1794) soon after his trials, Walker remained aloof from active reform politics, emerging only briefly in 1795 to oppose the <span class="roman">&#145;Gagging Acts&#146;</span>. By 1799 his business enterprise had collapsed and in 1806 he was twice unsuccessful in obtaining positions in the public service. By this time he was living on a small farm at Longford, Lancashire, surviving on a legacy bequeathed by Felix Vaughan. Walker died on 2 February 1817 at Longford and his body was interred at Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Lancashire.<br>
