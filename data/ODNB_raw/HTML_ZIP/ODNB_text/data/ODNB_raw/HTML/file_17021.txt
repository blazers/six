<span class="headword">Lorrain,  Paul</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1719), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and criminal biographer</span>, was a Huguenot immigrant to England. Neither the names of his parents nor the details of his education are known, but in 1681 his employer, Samuel Pepys, recorded that, &#145;his whole family, both by father and mother, are known protestants in France, and sufferers for being so,&#151;and himself by them bred up as such from the cradle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life, Journals</span>, 1.262). Some of Lorrain's kin found refuge in the Netherlands, while one Pierre Lorrain was admitted a member of the French church at Threadneedle Street, London, on 25 April 1671, bearing a certificate from his old congregation in Paris, where Paul is known to have had family. Paul had arrived in England by the late 1670s. There were those later who certainly thought that Lorrain had come as a religious refugee, but when in 1685 he praised Charles II for the safe haven he had provided for Huguenots, he wrote not of a personal debt he owed the king, but rather in third-person terms of:<blockquote>my deep Resentment [sense] of the Favours that many of my owne Country and Religion have so plentifully and seasonably receiv'd from His Bounty Basilick (which has been so graciously pleas'd so as to afford them a sanctuary in His Dominions, whilst it appear'd the whole World besides had no Place of Refuge for them). (BL, Stowe MS 987, fol. 8<i>r</i>)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="SecretarytoSamuelPepys"></a>Secretary to Samuel Pepys</h2>By the beginning of 1678 Lorrain was employed by Samuel Pepys as secretary, translator, and copyist, a position he held until 1700. He came recommended by &#145;a protestant minister, a man very eminent both at home and abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life, Journals</span>, 1.262). On 1 January 1678 Lorrain presented Pepys with &#145;Mulieres non Homines, ou, La Femme Deshumanis&eacute;e&#146; (&#145;Women not Men, or, The Female Dehumanized&#146;) as a new year's gift, a beautifully copied translation into French that he had made of a notorious spoof polemic originally published in Latin in 1595. He had, he explained, often heard Pepys in conversation with the fair sex tell them that they were not of the human race, nor capable of salvation, a paradox that he had put down to his master's good humour, but now, coming across this eighty-year-old text, found the argument neither as new nor as extravagant as he had thought. He rounded off the translation with a gallant apology &#145;Aux Dames&#146;. Lorrain was drawn into the problems of his master as Pepys, who came under suspicion in the wake of the Popish Plot, was falsely accused of treason and for a time imprisoned in the Tower of London. On 4 November 1678 Lorrain was required, as a member of Pepys's household, to display his protestant conformity by receiving the Anglican sacrament. In the following years Lorrain actively helped his master in his attempts to clear his name. In October 1679 he provided letters to two of his kinsmen in Paris as contacts for Pepys's brother-in-law. In January 1680 he witnessed a written statement against the sacked butler who had testified against Pepys in parliament. Most notably, in the summer of 1680 Lorrain helped his master in compiling&#151;and copied in his own hand&#151;the two volumes of evidences against Pepys's main accuser, John Scott, known as the <span class="roman">Book of Mornamont</span>. Lorrain himself came under suspicion of popery, and in January 1681 dared not leave Pepys's house until he had put together the evidence to prove his protestantism. There was thus something more than the conventional when Lorrain, who had witnessed Pepys's dangers at first hand, alluded to &#145;YOUR KNOWN INTEGRITY and FORTITUDE&#146;, in the dedication of a book to him in 1683  (P. Lorrain, <span class="italic">Rites of Funeral</span>, 1683, sig. A3<i>r</i>). His inscription of the copy he presented to Pepys underlined the debt he owed to his master:<blockquote>
<div>SAMUELL PEPYS<br>
</div>
<div>Anagram<br>
</div>
<div>ALMES-SUPPLIE<br>
</div>
<div>Whilst Godlike Charity's so much neglected,<br>
</div>
<div>And by the most as fruitless quite rejected<br>
</div>
<div>You do regard the Poor with Piteous Eye,<br>
</div>
<div>And are to them an Heav'n-sent Alms-Supply.<br>
</div> (Lorrain, <span class="italic">Rites of Funeral</span>, BL copy)</blockquote>Lorrain elaborated his taste for anagrams with his new year's gift to Pepys on 1 January 1685, a small handwritten book which echoed his master's toryism by disclosing the secret meaning contained within the letters of Charles II's formal title:<blockquote>
<div>He's God on Earth,<br>
</div>
<div>an Angelic Blessing of the Land,<br>
</div>
<div>Releef of the Church,<br>
</div>
<div>(that can defend it),<br>
</div>
<div>and Dear Frend of God.<br>
</div> (BL, Stowe MS 987, fol. 2<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Lorrain's thoughts carried on in similarly extravagant loyalist vein, in the course of the book condemning those &#145;moderne Writers, such as pen Romances, Novels, Pamphlets, and the like&#146;, who tailored their style:<blockquote>to please the gust [taste] of the Sick, than to give them good and wholesome Food, and choosing rather to set forth a bad piece that will take (as they call it) than a good one that will not relish the distemper'd palate of the squeamish Multitude. (ibid., fol. 6<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Lorrain was granted letters of denization on 31 January 1690. In the years following he helped his master in organizing his great library. During his years with Pepys, Lorrain also published a number of translations of protestant polemic and devotion. The first was <span class="italic">Marcus Minucius Felix Octavus, or, A Vindication of Christianity Against Paganism</span> (1682), using a French translation collated with the original Latin. Dedicating the book to John Tillotson, dean of Canterbury, Lorrain made clear the contemporary relevance of this third-century apologetic when he praised him as &#145;a Zealous Defender of our Christian religion against Atheism; of our Reformed Religion against the Romish Superstition, which is the old Paganism reviv'd and varnish'd over&#146;  (sigs. A2<i>v</i>&#150;A3<i>r</i>). <span class="italic">Rites of Funeral, Ancient and Modern</span>, a translation of a work by the French priest Pierre Muret, followed in 1683, excising a chapter on &#145;The funerals of hereticks&#146; which Lorrain regarded as &#145;little less or more, than an Invective against Protestants, in reference to their Rites of Burial&#146;  (&#145;The translator to the reader&#146;). There followed three translations of works of Huguenot piety. In 1688 Lorrain published as <span class="italic">A Preparation of the Lord's Supper, to which are Added, Maxims of True Christianity</span>, a compilation of two works by Pierre Allix. <span class="italic">A discourse of Christianity: laying open the abuses thereof in the Anti-Christian lives and worship of many of its professors; especially the Romanists; and shewing the way to a holy life in the character of a true Christian</span> (1693) was the translation of a work by Jean Ogier de Gombauld. <span class="italic">A way to salvation, or, The way to eternal bliss; being a collection of meditations and prayers suited to the exercise of a true Christian</span>, published in the same year, included pieces by Pierre Du Moulin, Pierre Drelincourt, and others, &#145;with some Additions of my own&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>)&#151;an interesting authorial intervention given that Lorrain was at this point himself still a layman.<br>
<br>By the late 1690s Lorrain's piety was drawing him to a career in the Church of England. He also had practical matters to consider: a future livelihood without his ageing patron and, probably, family responsibilities. The first surviving mention of a wife is in a letter dated 25 March 1700. He does not name her there, and&#151;especially given evidence of his (also unnamed) wife's bouts of serious illness in the summer of 1700 and in May 1709&#151;it not certain that Sarah, his widow, was his first and only wife. In January 1699 Pepys wrote supporting Lorrain's intention of &#145;consecrating the remainder of his life to His service in the Church, by entring into Holy Orders&#146; and praised his &#145;sobriety, diligence and integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 1.168). By October Pepys was complaining, in terms which convey both how dependent Pepys had become upon Lorrain and the latter's increasing absorption into his clerical role, of:<blockquote>the little time I have Lorraine with mee, and the restraint his praesent character putts upon me as to the uses I should have to make of him relateing to my books, papers and clerkelike services, other than bare sitting at his deske upon solemne works only; the generality of my studys, businesse, and domesticks subjecting mee to many lesser uses for an assistant-pen, more than hee is either in the way for, or I doubt would readily apply himselfe to if hee were &hellip; Nor is this a small difficulty with mee, as knowing too well my having no choice towards the solving it, there being noe body but hee that knows my businesse and manner of workeing, and at the same time qualifyed in every respect for doeing it. (ibid., 1.200&#150;01)</blockquote>Lorrain nevertheless continued to act as Pepys's copyist when the latter was unable to write letters himself, and continued to show concern for his master: in March 1700 he disobeyed Pepys's wishes and wrote a letter to his nephew John Jackson warning him of his uncle's ill health. At Pepys's funeral in 1703 he received a mourning ring worth 15<i>s</i>.<h2>
<a name="TheordinaryofNewgatehisaccount"></a>The ordinary of Newgate his account</h2>Well before that date Lorrain had left Pepys's service. On 7 November 1700 he was appointed ordinary (prison chaplain) of Newgate by the court of aldermen. &#145;I (who all along have endeavoured to live blameless and suitable to my Holy Profession) was by order of that Court committed to New-gate&#146;, he wrote to Jackson, begging his prayers that &#145;God will enable me to go through that great and important work, and to discharge the office incumbent on me to the Glory of God and the good of those poor wretched souls that shall come under my care&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 2.120). Lorrain's application had been supported by, among others, bishops Edward Fowler of Gloucester and Richard Kidder of Bath and Wells. As ordinary, his responsibility was not only to preach in the chapel and provide spiritual counsel to the prisoners and especially to the condemned. He also was to produce the semi-official broadsheet which followed each execution day, <span class="italic">The ordinary of Newgate his account of the behaviour, confessions, and last speeches of those that were executed at Tyburn</span>, a publication which had emerged in the 1670s and taken firmer shape under Samuel Smith, ordinary from 1676 to 1698. Lorrain's predecessor but one, John Allen, had been dismissed five months earlier for corrupt practices, which included &#145;his frequent prevarications in the printing and Publishing the pretended Confessions of the respective Criminalls That are executed at Tybourne&#146;  (Corporation of London RO, REP 104, fol. 340).<br>
<br>An important duty of Lorrain's was, therefore, to guarantee the integrity of the ordinary's <span class="italic">Account</span>, as it recounted the crimes and fate of the condemned, its record of their confessions to him in Newgate, and behaviour at the gallows dramatizing tales of sin and hard-won redemption. The <span class="italic">Account</span> was at once true-crime story and religious tract, and at once moral and commercial in its functions. Lorrain took both functions very seriously.<br>
<br>In 1712 Lorrain claimed in the case he addressed to the Commons that the <span class="italic">Account</span> should be exempt from stamp duty because it was a religious work, but he nevertheless implied the mingling of religious and secular considerations in its intentions. The <span class="italic">Account</span> contained &#145;nothing but DIVINITY, DEVOTION, and what may be most Useful to the World&#146;, appearing &#145;for the general satisfaction of the Publick&#146; and of value both to &#145;Good Men, in informing them in what they desire and have an Interest to Know&#146; and<blockquote>to the Wicked, in reforming them in what they are so very defective, and making them sensible of the Dangers and Miseries which attend a vicious and ill Course of Life, and plainly shewing them how to avoid an Untimely and Shameful Death in this World, and an Eternal one in the next. (Lorrain, <span class="italic">Case</span>)</blockquote>As the way to personal salvation lay through the atonement of public confession and execution for sins committed against society and against God, the <span class="italic">Account</span> (at its fullest) included details of the early life of the condemned and of how their sins had led them into crime. Lorrain could provide details of receivers and accomplices. Moreover, the <span class="italic">Account</span> sought to demonstrate that the condemned criminal was different in degree, not in kind, from the ordinary sinner, who faced the same crisis of salvation, a message underlined by placing criminals not as a breed apart but as ordinary members of the working population of London. Thus Lorrain became the sole biographer of many humble criminals: women such as Elizabeth Tethrington, aged twenty-nine, condemned for housebreaking, who had come to London from Ormskirk in Lancashire six years before to become an oyster-seller at Billingsgate before falling into bad company; or men such as Thomas Hunter, aged twenty-three, another housebreaker, born in St Botolph without Bishopsgate, who after serving a hard master for seven years fled, worked in victualling, and joined the navy before deserting and falling into a life of thieving.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Account</span> Lorrain presented his energetic attempts to win such criminals to salvation: in private and public meetings in the chapel, and in the condemned hold, and in the sermons of repentance he preached on the Sundays between trial and execution. How his message was received has been a matter of debate at the time and among modern scholars, the latter disturbed by the shaping of the experience of the condemned criminal to stereotyped models of the descent into sin and the obvious element of gaining the criminals' consent to the righteousness of the political and social order which was about to hang them. Were the condemned indifferent to Lorrain's message, or angry at the spiritual harrying that it entailed, or did they genuinely find solace in his words? His own accounts provide evidence for all three positions, and in the same person at different times in their last days. At the time observers disagreed on the effectiveness of his ministry. <span class="italic">The History of the Press-Yard</span> (1717) condescendingly noted that Lorrain:<blockquote>indeed did according to his Sufficiency, read Prayers tolerably well, and gave such Exhortations as might have been of benefit to the poor Souls they were directed to, but they had conceived such an indifferent Opinion of him from common Report, that all he said&#151;<i>was made to go in at one Ear and out at the other</i>. (p. 49)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Thetradesman"></a>The tradesman</h2>The profits of the <span class="italic">Account</span> in the early eighteenth century have been estimated as &pound;200 per annum, easily exceeding Lorrain's formal emoluments: each year he received a salary of &pound;35, supplemented by a charitable bequest of &pound;6 for preaching to the condemned and the grant to sell each year (usually) one City freedom, worth perhaps &pound;25. Its profitability evidently owed much to Lorrain's own energies. The most thorough study of the <span class="italic">Account</span> has argued that &#145;It would seem that much of the credit for firmly establishing the <span class="italic">Account</span> as not only a &#147;semi-official&#148; publication, but as a lucrative commercial enterprise in its own right rests with Paul Lorrain&#146;  (McKenzie, 239). He standardized the title and format (always writing in the first person). He carefully distinguished the authority of his text from the advertisements which appeared at the bottom of the <span class="italic">Account</span>, informing any readers who objected to their content that &#145;I have nothing to do with whatever comes in after my Name&#146;  (Harris, 18). Indeed, while the advertisements were often for works of piety&#151;very often Lorrain's own&#151;they could also include less obviously improving items such as a face-wash which &#145;plumps and softens the Skin, making it as smooth and tender as a sucking Child's&#146; and <span class="italic">The court of Venus, or, Cupid restor'd to right, being a history of Cuckolds and Cuckold-makers</span>  (Lorrain, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 7 Dec 1715). On several occasions he warned readers of the <span class="italic">Account</span> to accept no unreliable substitutes. Readers should spurn the &#145;sham-papers&#146; purporting to be the <span class="italic">Account</span> which often got the names and crimes wrong and misrepresented the spiritual state of the condemned. The only true account was the one which came out about eight o'clock the morning after the day of the execution under his name with its standard title and format.<br>
<br>Above all Lorrain maintained editorial and commercial control of the <span class="italic">Account</span>, frequently changing publishers and printers&#151;he employed at least seven over the years. One, Dryden Leach, bitterly complained in 1707 of Lorrain's hard-headed dealings, alleging that, although he had always &#145;very honestly&#146; paid Lorrain for every copy of the <span class="italic">Account</span>, when offered with better terms by another printer, Lorrain told Leach:<blockquote>in plain Terms, <i>That truly he must take him that would pay him best</i>, by this he excluded me: And now whether this is a Practice becoming a Clergyman or a Tradesman, I leave to the judicious part of Mankind, to make their own just Reflections. (McKenzie, 69)</blockquote>Leach further claimed that he had often received copies of the <span class="italic">Account</span> two days before the execution day it was alleged to report. This was not the only charge made against Lorrain to suggest that his greed got the better of his clerical duties. He was accused of having accepted bribes to work to obtain reprieves, and of having administered the sacrament to unworthy recipients for money. He was also charged with accepting cash to soften his account of some criminals.<br>
<br>Many of these accusations arose from the ambiguity of Lorrain's position as somebody who, through the <span class="italic">Account</span>, was profiting from his spiritual functions, and as somebody who turned tales of crime into tales of redemption. Daniel Defoe suggested that his high-flown tales of low criminals reaching salvation rather discredited the authority of the church, in <span class="italic">A Hymn to the Pillory</span> (1703):<blockquote>
<div>Where lies the Secret, let us know,<br>
</div>
<div>To make a <i>Sheep-stealer</i> a <i>Saint</i>? &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>If this <i>Wise Precedent</i> the World receives,<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Newgate</i> shall ne're be call'd a <i>Den of Thieves</i>:<br>
</div>
<div>What Rev'rence ought to such a Place be given,<br>
</div>
<div>That Ships so many Loads of <i>Saints to Heaven</i>?<br>
</div> (pp. 1&#150;2)</blockquote>The riposte by or on Lorrain's behalf, <span class="italic">Remarks on the author of the hymn to the pillory, with an answer to the hymn to the funeral sermon</span> (1703), not unreasonably cited in his defence the example of the thief on the cross beside Christ. Defoe's attack was sparked by the funeral sermon that Lorrain had delivered at St James, Clerkenwell, for Thomas Cook. Lorrain did indeed speak strongly of Cook's pious death, but the desire to preach a powerful sermon on repentance and salvation to a congregation whom he would not normally have reached was evidently Lorrain's motivation, rather than the fee as Defoe alleged. This is confirmed by reading the published text, <span class="italic">Walking with God</span>, with its insistent warning that its hearers might not be as lucky as Cook in being able to avoid damnation by timely repentance, and by who Cook actually was. Cook, a booth performer at the May fair, had been hanged a few days earlier for murdering a constable associated with the Reformation of Manners societies who had been trying to implement the queen's proclamation against vice at the fair. Cook, by profession and by his particular crime, was the embodiment of the sin that Lorrain was struggling against. His sincere repentance at the end was a pure example of what God's mercy and a willing soul could achieve.<br>
<br>Lorrain continued to publish other works. In 1702 he published <span class="italic">The dying man's assistant, or, Short instructions how to prepare sick persons for death: which are no less worthy the consideration of all good Christians in time of health, as shewing the importance of an early preparation for their latter end</span>. In 1707 he published the sermon he had preached for the fast day to commemorate the great fire of London, with alternative endings to its message of atonement adapted to the two congregations who heard it: to the worthy parishioners of St Dunstan's-in-the-West he exhorted charity to the poor; to the prisoners of Newgate he preached prayer and sincere repentance. In 1712, in <span class="italic">Popery Near a-kin to Paganism and Atheism</span>, he returned to his anti-popish strain, on the occasion of the abjuration of a Catholic priest accused of blasphemy.<h2>
<a name="PiratesandJacobites"></a>Pirates and Jacobites</h2>Lorrain's struggle to save the souls of the condemned appeared at its most dramatic at the execution of William Kidd for piracy at Execution Dock, Wapping, on 23 May 1701. Kidd had proved fairly resistant to Lorrain's exhortations in Newgate, believing (not without reason) that he was paying for the faults of his crew and his political patrons. Only when it was clear that there would be no reprieve did he at last make the briefest and most general of confessions. While he eventually promised to make a full confession at the gallows, he turned up at Wapping drunk, and &#145;was unwilling to own the Justice of his Condemnation, or so much as the Providence of God, who for his Sins, had deservedly brought him to this untimely End&#146;. While Lorrain sang psalms with the other pirates who were to die, their captain loudly warned all masters of ships to have a care of themselves and take warning by him. When the condemned were turned off, Kidd's rope split; he was again tied from the gallows. &#145;Now I found him in much better temper than before&#146;, Lorrain recorded, and with Kidd at the top of the ladder and himself perched half-way up, Lorrain redoubled his efforts, urging him to &#145;embrace (before it was too late) the Mercy of God, now again offer'd him, upon the easy Conditions of stedfast Faith, true Repentance, and perfect Charity. Which now indeed he did so fully and freely express, that I hope he was hearty and sincere in it&#146;  (Lorrain, <span class="italic">Kidd</span>).<br>
<br>The Jacobite prisoners in 1715 and 1716 faced Lorrain with another set of challenges. His role as the voice of the state condemning the sin of rebellion earned him an abusive and threatening letter in the autumn of 1715, attacking him as a sycophant to the usurper. It demanded:<blockquote>Is there one syllable in all the Doctrine of the Church of England (of which you now declare yourself to be a Member) that can Justifie Deposing King James or abjuring his Son, on acco[un]t of Religion? I know not what you think now, but turn the tables, &amp; I dare say you'l be of my opinion, &amp; soe let me ask you, whether you did not think it a hardship to be driven out of France for your principles? &amp; shall not King James &amp; his Son have the same regard? (BL, Add. MS 38507, fol. 172<i>r</i>)</blockquote>This was evidently only one of several Jacobite &#145;Vile and unseemly Elegies&#146; directed against Lorrain  (<span class="italic">Weekly Journal, or, British Gazetteer</span>, 10 Oct 1719, 1419). Other Jacobite prisoners showed the same refusal to accept that their rebellion was a crime. He urged the men awaiting execution in December 1715 that they make &#145;some publick Token of their Repentance for the publick Crime that had deservedly brought them to this open Shame&#146;. They replied that &#145;They would not hear me if I harp'd any longer upon this string: and what they only desired of me was, my reading to them the Prayers and Lessons appointed for the Day and no more&#146;  (Lorrain, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 7 Dec 1715). The nonjuror John Hall was even more shocking in his resolution and breach of the basic tenets of civility. At the gallows he refused to join Lorrain in prayer, &#145;but all the while turn'd his back upon me; a Thing which no Protestant ever did before on such an Occasion&#146;. &#145;Mr Hall, methinks you might have been more serious, and more civil; what harm have I now done to you, in imploring God's Mercy to your Soul?&#146;  (Lorrain, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 13 July 1716).<br>
<br>Bolstered by their refusal to accept the validity of Lorrain's claims, these prisoners offered perhaps the most extreme form of resistance to his authority. It was reinforced by suspicions of him as an informer, exploiting his position to &#145;Expose some things which fell in his way, to the Service of the Government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Journal, or, British Gazetteer</span>, 10 Oct 1719, 1419).<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Account</span> of May 1719 Lorrain offered a reward for discovering the author and publisher of a libel which had accused him of getting drunk on gin in a brandy-shop in Newgate Street; going the day after to condemned prisoners in the chapel, &#145;he shamefully spue'd upon his Cushion and then dy'd&#146;. It went on to accuse him of having been before he took holy orders a French dancing-master who had himself been tried at the Old Bailey  (McKenzie, 202). Lorrain showed his accustomed sensitivity to attacks on his position. The kernel of truth may be that he was already ill. He died five months later about 6 p.m. on 7 October 1719, in his house in Town Ditch (now Houndsditch), near Christ's Hospital, where he had moved from the house near St Bartholomew's Close, West Smithfield, in which he had been living in 1715. His will, made on 14 March 1712 and proved by his widow, Sarah, nine days after his death, inevitably paid a more than formulaic attention to the state of his soul: &#145;I nothing doubting but firmly beleiving that by the power &amp; mercy of Almighty God I shall receive the same [my body] again Glorious and Immortall at the Generall Resurrection in the last day Amen&#146;. To his immediate (unnamed) heir at law he left a mere twelve pence should he demand it; otherwise he left everything to &#145;my loving and most dearly beloved Wife&#146;  (GL, MS 9051/11, fol. 245). The <span class="italic">Weekly Journal, or, Saturday Post</span> reported that he left an estate of &pound;5000, but no inventory survives to substantiate this claim.<br>
