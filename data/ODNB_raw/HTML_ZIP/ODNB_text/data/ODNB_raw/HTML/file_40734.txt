<span class="headword">Harrison,  Austin Frederic</span>  (1873&#150;1928), <span class="occ">journalist and journal editor</span>, was born on 27 March 1873 at 1 Southwick Place, London, the second of four sons and a daughter of the positivist writers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33732/', "Frederic Harrison (1831&#150;1923)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38884/', "Ethel Bertha Harrison (1851&#150;1916)")</script>. His first lessons, with his older brother, Bernard, were given by their parents until December 1880. Then, to the boys' delight, their father employed as their tutor the struggling young novelist George Gissing. His visits to the Harrisons' comfortable house at 38 Westbourne Terrace, Bayswater, continued for three years, after which Austin spent three years at St Paul's School, London, and three at Harrow School. He then studied languages in Lausanne, Marburg, and Berlin to prepare for the Foreign Office examination. After failing it in 1896, he was hired by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a favour to his father, and sent to its Berlin office. Its formidable chief, George Saunders, soon had him dismissed, and he was then sent by the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> to the Hague Peace Conference to assist W. T. Stead, who also eased him out. He fared better at Reuters news agency in Berlin, rising to office manager.<br>
<br>By 1904 the German foreign office's control of information and Reuters' prohibition against opinion in dispatches so frustrated Harrison that he resigned from Reuters and documented his apprehensions about the Kaiser in <span class="italic">The Pan-Germanic Doctrine</span> (1904). In London he did freelance journalism until his book caught the eye of Sir Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe), who suddenly installed him as political editor of his prestigious Sunday <span class="italic">Observer</span>. Besides weekly leaders, Harrison wrote eye-witness accounts of St Petersburg after &#145;bloody Sunday&#146; (22 January 1905) and of German political developments in 1906, reprinted as <span class="italic">England and Germany</span> in 1907. Towards the end of that year, the unpredictable Harmsworth replaced him with J. L. Garvin, naming Harrison <span class="italic">The Observer's</span> literary editor and drama critic of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>.<br>
<br>Finally, at the end of 1909 Harrison attained the position that made his reputation. Sir Alfred Mond (later the first Baron Melchett) invited him to edit the <span class="italic">English Review</span>, a literary and political monthly which Mond had just purchased. Aware that mismanagement had doomed it under its founding editor, Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford), Harrison displayed Nietzsche's admonition in his office: &#145;Be hard, my brothers&#146;. His editorial practices irritated some, but contrary to what is often asserted the <span class="italic">English Review</span> maintained its high standards for years. Indeed, Harrison published many of Ford's contributors&#151;for example, Joseph Conrad, D. H. Lawrence, H. G. Wells, and Norman Douglas, who became his literary sub-editor. He opened the review to women, continental writers, and promising unknowns. By challenging conventional attitudes towards sexuality with the work of writers like Frank Harris he ran afoul of the Vigilance Society, newsagents, and libraries. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> accused him of &#145;dumping garbage on the nation's doorstep&#146;  (8 July 1911). Harrison defended his &#145;adult review&#146; in a petition signed by fifty well-known writers. <span class="italic">The Everlasting Mercy</span> by John Masefield created another storm, but caused the circulation to jump to 18,000. Reducing the magazine's price from 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. in 1912 proved advantageous, and Harrison was able to buy out Mond in 1915.<br>
<br>Under Harrison the <span class="italic">English Review</span> supported liberal reforms and military preparedness. When his fears of Germany were validated in 1914, he reprinted his earlier warnings in a best-seller for Stanley Unwin, <span class="italic">The Kaiser's War</span> (1914). The death of Harrison's youngest brother in the battle of Festubert (1915) made him especially bitter about the scandal of shortage of munitions. He supported the coalition war cabinet, but was so opposed to Lloyd George's punitive peace terms that he stood quixotically against the prime minister in his own Welsh constituency in 1918. He was an early proponent of a league of nations.<br>
<br>In 1923 Harrison sold the <span class="italic">English Review</span>, which was then in decline. Having helped found PEN, an international society of writers, he wished to write books himself. While engaged in newspaper journalism, mainly for the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>, he published <span class="italic">Lifting Mist</span> (1924), a novel about school life; <span class="italic">Pandora's Hope</span> (1925), speculations about women; and his one enduring book, <span class="italic">Frederic Harrison: Thoughts and Memories</span> (1926), a loving portrait of his father. They had resolved their differences over Austin's marriage on 30 April 1914 to the American-born Mary Medora Greening (1880&#150;1980) after her divorce from the pianist Evlyn Howard-Jones. Harrison took a great interest in the education of his children, two daughters and a son. He died at his home, Lychgate House, Seaford, Sussex, of bronchial pneumonia on 13 July 1928, and was cremated on 17 July at Golders Green.<br>
