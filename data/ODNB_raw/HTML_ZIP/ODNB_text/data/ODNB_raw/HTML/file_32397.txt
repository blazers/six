<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chifley,  Joseph Benedict <span class="st"> [Ben]</span></span>  (1885&#150;1951), <span class="occ">prime minister of Australia</span>, was born at Bathurst, New South Wales, on 22 September 1885, the eldest of three sons of Irish-Australian and Irish immigrant parents, Patrick Chifley (1862&#150;1921), a blacksmith, and his wife, Mary Anne Corrigan (1856?&#150;1929). He attended a bush school and then spent two years at the Patrician Brothers' High School, Bathurst. Before and after joining the New South Wales railways as a shop-boy in 1903, he educated himself assiduously for years at night school, and through the Workers' Educational Association and the Railways Institute. On 6 June 1914 Chifley, a Roman Catholic, married, in the Presbyterian church, Elizabeth Gibson (1886&#150;1962), daughter of George McKenzie, a fellow railwayman. The McKenzies gave the Chifleys a house where they lived for the rest of their lives. They had no children. Chifley remained a non-communicant Roman Catholic until his death.<br>
<br>Chifley rose to full driver's rank in 1913 and subsequently also gave instruction in his craft. A local and state trade union officer (while still working as a driver), he appeared repeatedly as expert witness or advocate in industrial arbitration proceedings. In 1917, as a prominent leader of his union, he was dismissed from the railway service following the failure of a bitter and far-reaching strike in New South Wales industry. On appeal he was reinstated to a junior rating, with loss of superannuation and seniority rights. His union had been decimated, and was deregistered by the state industrial court. He was one of a handful of men who worked unrelentingly for years to rebuild the union and restore the strikers' former positions. In 1920 he was a founder of the nationwide Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, with access to the commonwealth arbitration court. But not until the return of a Labor government in New South Wales in 1925 were the pre-1917 seniority and other rights of the strikers regained.<br>
<br>In 1922 Chifley followed his father as a director of the Bathurst District Hospital and of a local daily newspaper, the Bathurst <span class="italic">National Advocate</span>. Among many other local public activities, he was from 1933 to 1947 a member (and for several years president) of the Abercrombie shire council.<br>
<br>In 1922 and again in 1924 Chifley failed to win selection as Labor candidate for the local seat in the New South Wales legislative assembly. In 1925, as Labor candidate for the federal seat of Macquarie (which included Bathurst), Chifley ran the sitting government member close. In 1928 he won Macquarie and in 1929 held it when a Labor government under J. H. Scullin was swept into office. Without control of the senate and confronted by the mounting misery and turmoil of the depression, the Labor Party was soon split by frustration and dissension inside and outside parliament. Early in 1931 the cabinet suffered defections to right and left. On 2 March Chifley was elected to one of the vacancies and served as minister for defence and minister assisting the treasurer, E. G. Theodore. At the end of March the New South Wales state branch under J. T. Lang, who had been at loggerheads with Scullin, was expelled from the Australian Labor Party but retained considerable popular support. In November the government was defeated by the defection of Lang sympathizers in the house of representatives. Theodore, Chifley, and most other New South Wales members who had remained loyal to the federal Labor Party lost their seats at the December elections, which resulted in a landslide against Labor.<br>
<br>From 1931 until 1940, Chifley's bids to re-enter parliamentary life failed. He gave years of leadership to the struggle in New South Wales to reunite the Labor factions and to oust Lang (which was achieved in 1939&#150;40). From 1936 to 1937 Chifley served on the royal commission on banking, recommending bank nationalization in a minority report. Following the outbreak of war in 1939 the non-Labor government of R. G. Menzies appointed Chifley a member of the capital issues advisory board, director of labour supply in the department of munitions, and a member of other wartime bodies. In September 1940, however, Chifley regained the Macquarie seat and was elected to the opposition front bench.<br>
<br>In October 1941, when Labor under John Curtin assumed government, Chifley took office as third-ranking minister, with the treasury portfolio (which he held continuously until December 1949), membership of the war cabinet and the production executive of cabinet, and also (December 1942&#150;February 1945) the additional portfolio of minister for post-war reconstruction. Curtin increasingly relied on Chifley as his &#145;home front&#146; and house of representatives aide and as his closest confidant.<br>
<br>As treasurer, Chifley pushed taxation to new levels, while filling loans of unprecedented proportions several times a year. He imposed stringent controls on credit, prices, and consumption, achieving by 1943 comprehensive stabilization and rationing schemes that afforded &#145;fair shares&#146; while releasing a maximum of food and supplies to Britain and her allies and holding cost-of-living figures stationary until the war was won. With the uniform taxation legislation of 1942 he permanently reinforced commonwealth financial ascendancy by establishing a federal monopoly of direct taxation. By wartime regulation, followed by legislation in 1945, he expanded the central banking and other functions of the Commonwealth Bank, reformed its direction, and brought other banks under stricter central bank and governmental control.<br>
<br>Despite the government's failure in the years 1942&#150;4 to win approval for wider constitutional powers for the federal parliament, Chifley prepared a wide range of measures for demobilizing and re-establishing former servicemen and -women and war workers, land settlement, housing, social security and health service extensions upon an entirely new financial basis, grants to universities and scholarships for their students, disposing of wool and other surplus stocks, national development works, and the use or disposal of government munition factories and surplus construction equipment. These were applied with a high degree of timeliness and success. In his dual wartime ministerial capacities he was also the key man behind Australian participation in international planning of mutual aid, relief, food and agriculture, monetary stabilization, full employment, and increased world trade.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1945 Chifley became acting prime minister and on 12 July, following Curtin's death, prime minister. He represented Australia at two historic prime ministers' conferences in London&#151;that of 1946, which made a crucial review of the British Commonwealth's changed strategic and economic requirements, and that of 1949, which thrashed out a basis for retaining republican India as a full partner. He was an unvarnished, practical British Commonwealth man. Between 1945 and 1949, during the absence of colleagues overseas, he acted as minister for external affairs for a total of some seventeen months and minister for defence for a shorter period. Chifley displayed a high order of statesmanship in leading the nation and, not least, his own party towards accepting new and uncomfortable facts of international life facing Australia in the fields of collective security, world economic arrangements, and the emergent Asia. He judged Dutch efforts to curb Indonesian nationalists as about as useless as &#145;poking a stick into water&#146;  (Ward, 268). In all this his hand was strengthened by the convincing vote of confidence lent to his government by the general elections of 1946.<br>
<br>At home, as treasurer as well as prime minister, Chifley carried on his battle for economic stability with high success until he failed in May 1948 to carry a constitutional amendment allowing the federal parliament to maintain essential economic controls beyond the life of the wartime defence powers; but even then he did not give up the struggle. He was also a firm believer in a large public sector of the economy. He was the leading spirit behind the measures for nationalizing internal and external airlines, banking, stevedoring, and telecommunications, for the close public control of coalmining and broadcasting, for the public development of hydroelectric power, atomic energy, coastal shipping, aluminium production, whaling, and television, for the advance planning of massive national development works by the Australian National Works Council (which he created in 1943), and for reorganizing and expanding the commonwealth's scientific and industrial research organizations. His was the decisive role in founding the Australian National University and inaugurating the huge Snowy Mountains hydroelectricity scheme. Although the courts ruled nationalization of internal airlines and banking unconstitutional, the Chifley government created a public airline (Trans-Australia Airlines) to compete with private lines and expanded the Commonwealth Bank. He aimed in all of these measures at controlling and civilizing capitalism, not at abolishing it.<br>
<br>Opposed by the British Medical Association in Australia, Chifley failed to complete his design for non-contributory national health services. In the field of industrial arbitration and conciliation, however, he succeeded in reforming the existing institutions on a basis better adapted to cope with the industrial unrest during the post-war transition, unrest greatly aggravated by communist leadership of some of the largest industrial unions. Chifley insisted on sustaining civil liberties in the industrial field (though some thought otherwise) but he provided procedures enabling trade unionists to overcome communist rigging of union ballots. His government enlarged the membership of both houses of the national parliament in 1948 to represent more adequately the growing electorate.<br>
<br>After an attempt to nationalize the banks in 1947, the politics of which Chifley mishandled badly, his opponents redoubled their efforts to overthrow his government. All sectional grievances were vigorously exploited; the opposition attacked particularly Chifley's economic controls, retained in the post-war years to sustain stability at home and the hard-pressed British food standards and sterling area balances abroad. A severe coalminers' strike in the summer of 1949 made for temporary public hardships and Chifley's use of the military to work the open-cut mines at its height alienated many in the labour movement. In the December general elections, opposition promises to end the recently reintroduced petrol rationing and extend child endowment (with which Chifley refused to compete) probably proved decisive. Among other things, he had failed to pay sufficient attention to what he himself termed the &#145;hip-pocket nerve&#146; of the Australian electorate  (Manne, 179). A Liberal&#150;Country Party composite government took office under Menzies. Labor, however, held a majority in the senate.<br>
<br>As leader of the opposition (1949&#150;51), Chifley determinedly fought some of the methods provided for in a bill to suppress communism in the trade unions and elsewhere. After he had gained some important concessions from Menzies, the federal executive of the Labor Party, against his advice, called a halt to further opposition that might have brought about an early double dissolution of parliament on the communist issue. But Chifley's deputy, H. V. Evatt, on behalf of some of the unions, fought the <span class="roman">Communist Party Dissolution Act</span> in the high court and got it declared unconstitutional. A deadlock at that time (March 1951) between house and senate over a bill to undo parts of Chifley's 1945 banking reforms provided the government with the opportunity to dissolve both houses and fight an election mainly on the communist issue. At the end of November 1950 Chifley had suffered a heart seizure that had required three months' rest. But he now campaigned doggedly throughout Australia to the limit of his strength. In April 1951 the Menzies government was returned with a majority in the senate and a reduced majority in the house. Chifley was re-elected unopposed as leader of the Labor opposition. But on 13 June, while resting in his room in the Hotel Kurrajong, Canberra, he suffered a second heart attack and died without regaining consciousness.<br>
<br>Chifley was a man of fine presence, naturally shy, yet warm, outgoing, and quietly humorous. He was a most capable and successful negotiator and a tremendous desk-worker, for whom his civil service officers had unstinted admiration. A much-loved party colleague, with the confidence also of his opponents, he was a very successful parliamentary manager. He was not an orator and a chronic throat condition over the last twenty years of his life (he described his voice as resembling &#145;a lot of rusty old chains knocking together&#146;; Waterson, 414) weakened his otherwise persuasive debating powers. His colourful, homespun expressions rarely missed their mark. Chifley had (except over Menzies' anti-communist measures) an extraordinarily complete command of his party inside and outside parliament&#151;no Labor prime minister has rivalled his sustained command of his followers. He was a typical Australian Labor amalgam of radical, socialist, and conservative. Politics was for Chifley the art of the possible and he pursued the social and economic betterment of his fellows, his &#145;light on the hill&#146;  (McMullin, 254) as effectively as any other Australian Labor prime minister. Yet his fatal misreadings of the bank nationalization issue and the 1949 coal strike finally brought him down.<br>
<br>Chifley was sworn of the privy council in 1946. He was accorded a state funeral and was buried in the Bathurst City Cemetery, where a memorial has been raised over his grave by the Labor Party.<br>
