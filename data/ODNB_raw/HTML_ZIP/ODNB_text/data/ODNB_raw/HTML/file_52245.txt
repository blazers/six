<span class="headword">Eveske,  Elias  l'</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1259), <span class="occ">financier and leader of the Jewish community in England</span>, was the eldest of the several sons of Benedict l'Eveske of London. Born before 1200, he became a prominent figure during the 1220s, and by the 1230s was firmly established as one of the leading members of the London Jewish community. In 1237 and 1241 he served the crown as a tax assessor and collector, and in 1238 was a commissioner against coin-clipping. It was also during these years that he began lending money and selling bonds to members of Henry III's court. In 1243 the king appointed him archpresbyter, thus establishing him as the administrative head of the English Jewish community and the chief Jewish official at the Jewish exchequer.<br>
<br>The period of l'Eveske's archpresbyterate was disastrous for English Jewry. Savage royal taxation, crushing inheritance fines, and accusations of ritual murder devastated Jewish communities throughout the realm. As archpresbyter, l'Eveske was directly involved in implementing the king's destructive policies. He cannot have done so happily, and in 1254 he petitioned, unsuccessfully, for permission for the Jews of England to depart the realm. At the same time, however, he used his influence at the exchequer to secure tax reductions and exemptions for himself and his brothers, thus placing an even heavier burden of taxation upon others.<br>
<br>The resulting divisions within the London Jewish community finally brought about l'Eveske's downfall. His favourable tax assessments were revoked. In 1249 and again in 1252 he was accused of malfeasance in office, but both times he was restored to office. In June 1257, however, he was accused of having fraudulently transferred several debts to Richard, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1272), on which l'Eveske then continued to collect payment. He was convicted and deposed from office. Hagin and Cresse, sons of Master Moses of London, thereupon paid the king 3 gold marks on behalf of the English Jewish community for his promise never to restore l'Eveske to the archpresbyterate, and to allow the community in future to elect their archpresbyter. In February 1258 Hagin succeeded l'Eveske as archpresbyter.<br>
<br>In December 1258, however, Elias l'Eveske was accused by Cresse, the brother of Hagin, of having ordered his servant, John Forncett, to make a murderous attack upon Hagin in a London street. Hagin was too gravely wounded to appear in court, but l'Eveske, with his two sons, did appear, and in January 1259 all three converted to Christianity, thus ending the case against them. As they were converts, their property escheated to the king, who sold it, for 400 marks, to Master Elijah Menahem (<i>d</i>. 1284), brother to Cresse and Hagin. L'Eveske's sons took the baptismal names Adam and Nicholas, but his own new name is unknown, as is his fate after this date. His wife has not been identified. They had at least three children. Their daughter Hannah married Josce, archpresbyter from 1207 until 1236. One son, Isaac, was active in his father's business of lending money. The other son is unknown. No other sons are recorded; it may be presumed, therefore, that these were the two sons who converted with their father to Christianity.<br>
