<span class="headword">Baillie,  Alexander</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1655), <span class="occ">abbot of Regensburg</span>, of the family of Carnbroe, Lanarkshire, went to school in Scotland, then in August 1612 was enrolled at the protestant University of Helmstedt. Having become a Catholic he entered the Scots College, Rome, that same year. He is said to have also studied at Heidelberg and travelled in France and Italy.<br>
<br>On 25 November 1615 Baillie received the habit at the Scots Benedictine monastery in Regensburg and made his vows at the sister abbey in W&uuml;rzburg on 30 November 1617. In 1622 he was prior there under Abbot William Ogilvie. He travelled to Scotland and, having returned, was in early 1623 made prior and cellarer at Regensburg. In 1628 he published at W&uuml;rzburg a polemical work, <span class="italic">A True Information of the Unhallowed Offspring &hellip; of our Scottish-Calvinian Gospel</span>, which despite much tedious invective gives interesting glimpses of contemporary Scotland.<br>
<br>Invasion by the Swedish protestant forces in the 1630s caused immense disruption to the three Scots abbeys, scattering the monks and devastating their economy. Baillie escaped before W&uuml;rzburg was captured in October 1631 and in January 1633 is found as cellarer at Regensburg. He again had to flee when that town was captured in November, then, returning after its recapture, was in December 1634 made administrator. On 13 November 1636 he was elected abbot of Erfurt but could not take possession because of enemy occupation and again administered the Regensburg abbey until finally, on 18 January 1646, he was elected its abbot.<br>
<br>Clearly a competent administrator Baillie restored its economy, though greatly hampered by a lack of monks and harassment from various quarters. In 1641 an attempt to oust the Scots was thwarted but in 1653, apparently worn out by poor health and troubles, he made an Irish monk his coadjutor and successor. This prospective takeover was, however, vetoed by Rome.<br>
<br>At Regensburg Baillie had a cartulary of the monastery compiled, personally checking the transcripts and adding his own chronicle; although the latter is somewhat subjective, both are valuable sources. Some historical work by him has survived in later compilations. He died at St Jakob, Regensburg, on 7 April 1655, having played a key role in preserving the three Scots monasteries.<br>
