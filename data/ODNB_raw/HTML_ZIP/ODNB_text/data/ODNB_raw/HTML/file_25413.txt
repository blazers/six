<span class="headword">Shipley,  William Davies</span>  (1745&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 5 October 1745 at Midgham, Berkshire, the only son among the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25411/', "Dr Jonathan Shipley (1713&#150;1788)")</script>, bishop of St Asaph, and his wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mordaunt (1716/17&#150;1803), and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25412/', "William Shipley")</script>. He was educated at Westminster School under William Markham and then at Winchester College; he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 21 December 1763, from where he graduated BA on 19 January 1769 and MA in 1771.<br>
<br>Shipley was ordained priest and followed his father's example in rapidly accumulating benefices in plurality. As the new bishop of St Asaph, Jonathan Shipley appointed his son vicar of Ysgeifiog on 19 March 1770. Other livings in that diocese soon followed, including the vicarage of Wrexham, Denbighshire, on 6 February 1771 and the sinecure rectory of Llangwn on 11 April 1772, which Shipley exchanged first for Corwen (1774&#150;82) and subsequently for Llanarmon yn Ial (1782&#150;1816). He was additionally appointed chancellor of the St Asaph diocese in 1773 and named dean of the cathedral on 27 May 1774, and held all these posts until his death. They were collectively worth more than &pound;2000 p.a. in the early 1780s. He married, on 28 April 1777, Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1789), elder daughter and coheir of Ellis Yonge of Byrn Yorkin, near Wrexham, and next of kin to Sir John Conway, third and last baronet, her maternal great-grandfather. The Conways' holdings included Rhuddlan Castle and a sugar plantation in St Kitt's. The marriage made the Shipleys one of the wealthiest families in north Wales.<br>
<br>Shipley gained national notice from his involvement in a seditious libel case that drew attention to his own whiggish politics as well as his obstinacy. In August 1782 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15105/', "William Jones")</script> (who married Shipley's sister Anna Maria in April 1783) published anonymously, under the auspices of the Society for Constitutional Information, a reformist political tract called <span class="italic">The Principles of Government, in a Dialogue between a Scholar and a Peasant</span>. As chairman of the Flintshire Association and Correspondence (for parliamentary reform) Shipley publicly read a copy of Jones's pamphlet at the county meeting of 7 January 1783 without previously familiarizing himself with its contents, and carried a resolution that it be translated into Welsh. However, once he had been privately advised that the proposal might be misinterpreted the project was dropped.<br>
<br>The Flintshire committee had already been criticized for its initial approbation of Jones's pamphlet, and Shipley now committed the tactical error of rushing to its defence. On 24 January 1783 he took a copy of the <span class="italic">Dialogue</span> and with his own hand substituted throughout the words &#145;gentleman&#146; and &#145;farmer&#146; for &#145;scholar&#146; and &#145;peasant&#146;. He then asked his curate at Wrexham to have a few copies of the amended tract reprinted by a Wrexham bookseller. His precipitate action brought down all the wrath of his political opponents on his head. At a county meeting in March 1783 the high sheriff of Flintshire, Thomas Fitzmaurice (brother of the recent prime minister, William Petty, earl of Shelburne), castigated Shipley as a preacher of sedition, and travelled to London to request his prosecution by the government for seditious libel. The law officers refused to act but Fitzmaurice, undeterred, proceeded privately. Shipley was indicted at the Wrexham great sessions in April 1783 for publishing a seditious libel. The case came for hearing at Denbighshire grand sessions, in Wrexham, in September, with Lloyd Kenyon as presiding judge and Thomas Erskine as Shipley's counsel, retained by the Society for Constitutional Information. Jones had meanwhile made known to Kenyon that he was the author of the tract, a confession that had not prevented his nomination as a judge of the supreme court of Bengal. Shipley had also complained to the Society for Constitutional Information on 16 June 1783 that he had been singled out &#145;for the object of a Prosecution founded on an anonymous letter, supported by anonymous abuse and lying Reports, and carried out under a false name, with the clandestine Malignity of an Informer that feels ashamed of his own malice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 30 July 1783).<br>
<br>The Wrexham hearing having been postponed on legal grounds, the case was removed in March 1784, by a writ of <i>certiorari</i>, to the king's bench and then remitted for trial to Shrewsbury assizes, where it was finally heard before Mr Justice (Francis) Buller on 6 August 1784. Buller directed that the jury was merely to find on the fact of publication and the truth of the innuendoes as laid; whether the words constituted a libel or not was for the court. Erskine resisted this view, and the jury's initial verdict was guilty of publishing only. Buller intervened to ask them to reconsider their verdict, and following his directions the jury again decided that Shipley was guilty of publishing but did not find on the question of whether the tract was a libel or not.<br>
<br>On 16 November 1784 Erskine, before the court of king's bench, argued on grounds of misdirection for a new trial, which the lord chief justice, William Murray, Baron Mansfield, refused. However, the defendant was not committed, and Erskine went on to present a motion to the court in arrest of judgment. Mansfield ruled that as the publication was abstract no part of the publication was really criminal, and the dean was discharged as a free man. The news was well received in north Wales, and bonfires were lit and houses illuminated as Shipley proceeded in December first on a visit to his father at Twyford, near Winchester, and subsequently through Shrewsbury, Wrexham, and Ruthin to Llannerch Park (his father's other seat, in Denbighshire), and then to his own residence near St Asaph. The interest that the protracted proceedings evoked&#151;the greatest of all trials for seditious libel, according to Holdsworth&#151;increased pressure from the Portland whigs in parliament to transfer the decision of what is libellous from judge to jury, a change embodied in Fox's <span class="roman">Libel Act</span>, 1792 (32 Geo. III, c.60).<br>
<br>Shipley's action ended his prospects of a bishopric, made him suspect to government supporters in Flintshire, and reduced the credibility of the proponents of reform in north Wales. A vague proposal to recommence proceedings against him is mentioned in a letter addressed in the aftermath of the 1796 general election to Lord Chief Justice Kenyon by Thomas Pennant, who passes on some spiteful stories of the dean&#151;&#145;that profligate man&#146;&#151;noting the extent to which Bishop Lewis Bagot was under his thumb and concluding bluntly &#145;the manner he has past his probation from that time [of his trial] to this, convinces everyone of his incorrigibility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 545). Two months later, on 8 January 1797, Pennant was gleefully telling Kenyon about reports of a trespasser being shot by the dean on his land after a quarrel about a pig. &#145;Enraged, he ran after the divine with his spade, but could not overtake him. I am told the affair was made up with a sum of money&#146;  (ibid., 546). Shipley's character was always considered suspect by Pennant and other north Wales Pittites but against this view should be set his undoubted warm-heartedness (which could so readily turn into impetuousness) and the affection in which he was held by many dissenters. Throughout life he was known for his &#145;sincere attachment &hellip; to those liberal principles which produced the Revolution [of 1688]&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 96/2, 641).<br>
<br>Shipley published little apart from a sermon for Chester Infirmary in 1790. He wrote a preface to the edition of his father's works published in 1792, in which he justified the bishop's sympathy for the American revolutionaries, but this does not appear in ordinary copies of the work. He also assisted his widowed sister in collecting the letters and other literary remains of Sir William Jones, published in 1799. Most of his energies went into maintaining St Asaph Cathedral. While he was dean the chapter house was taken down (1779) and the fabric of the cathedral repaired: the choir was rebuilt, a new episcopal throne and pulpit provided, and a reredos erected (1810). The money to pay for many of these improvements was provided by the <span class="roman">St Asaph Cathedral Act</span> of 1814. Shipley died at his residence, Bodrhyddan, near St Asaph, on 7 May 1826. He was buried at Rhuddlan, in Denbighshire, where a tablet was raised to his memory. His wife had died in childbirth at Llannerch on 15 November 1789, leaving five sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>The eldest son, William Shipley (1778&#150;1820), was whig MP for Flint boroughs from 1807 to 1812 and for St Mawes from 1812 to 1813. He had been expected by his patrons, the Wynns and the Grenvilles, to become an effective politician but instead proved more interested in grouse, and was killed in a shooting accident; his son William, on the dean's death, assumed the name Conwy. Shipley's eldest daughter, Penelope, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28785/', "Dr Pelham Warren")</script>, a prominent London physician; the second, Anna Maria, married Colonel Charles A. Dashwood; and the third, Amelia, married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12853/', "Revd Reginald Heber")</script> in April 1809. It was while on a visit to his father-in-law that Heber composed, at the old vicarage, Wrexham, his popular hymn &#145;From Greenland's icy mountain&#146;. Shipley's fourth son, <a name="cosubject_25409"></a><span class="headword">Conway Shipley</span>  (1782&#150;1808)<span class="occ"></span>, entered the navy in 1793 as a midshipman under Thomas Pakenham on the <i>Invincible</i>, and served on that ship at the battle on the &#145;glorious&#146; 1 June 1794. After service on the frigate <i>Phoebe</i> under Sir Robert Barlow he was commissioned lieutenant in 1800, and in 1804, when in command of the corvette HMS <i>Hippomenes</i>, captured a French privateer, <i>L'Egyptienne</i>, of much greater tonnage. He was consequently made post captain and commanded the frigate <i>Nymphe</i> in the Tagus expedition under Sir Charles Cotton. He was killed in a cutting-out expedition on the Tagus on 23 April 1808. A monument was erected on the river bank by his fellow officers. Shipley's fifth son, the Revd Charles Shipley (1783&#150;1834), was deprived of his fellowship at All Souls, Oxford, in 1810, despite a charge of assault with indecency against an Oxford bookseller's boy failing at the Oxford Lent assizes in 1809; he was rector of Mappowder, Dorset, from 1814. Charles Shipley's fourth son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38872/', "Orby Shipley")</script>.<br>
