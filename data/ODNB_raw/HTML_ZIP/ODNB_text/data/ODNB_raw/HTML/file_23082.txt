<span class="headword">Ramsay, Sir  George</span>, ninth baronet  (1800&#150;1871), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23102/', "William Ramsay (1806&#150;1865)")</script>, professor of humanity at Glasgow University, was born at home on 19 March 1800. He was the second son of Sir William Ramsay, seventh baronet (<i>d</i>. 1807), of Bamff House, Aylth, Perthshire, and Agnata Frances, daughter of Vincent Biscoe of Hookwood, Surrey. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1823 and MB in 1826. On 9 October 1830 he married Emily Eugenia (1806&#150;1885), youngest daughter of Captain Henry Lennon of co. Westmeath, with whom he had three sons. He succeeded his elder brother, Sir James Ramsay, as ninth baronet on 1 January 1859 and died at Bamff on 22 February 1871; the title passed to his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35662/', "Sir James Henry Ramsay")</script>, the historian. His youngest son, George Gilbert Ramsay LLD, was elected professor of humanity at Glasgow University in 1863.<br>
<br>Ramsay wrote voluminously on philosophy, psychology, and political economy from a standpoint firmly within the Scottish common-sense philosophical tradition. One of the most notable features of his writings is his determined opposition to utilitarianism, which in his <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Principles of Human Happiness and Human Duty</span> (1843) he criticizes for excessive emphasis on rationality and consequent neglect of sources of emotional satisfaction. In his writings Ramsay attempts to counteract philosophical rationality by the use of literary examples, a tendency most pronounced in his <span class="italic">The Philosophy and Poetry of Love</span> (1848), where excerpts from his philosophical writings are interspersed with a literary anthology. Ramsay's ethical philosophy chiefly distinguishes itself from that of his Scottish Enlightenment forebears through its romanticism; he strongly emphasizes the destructive effect of ennui on human happiness, and as an antidote recommends the state of continual emotion ensured by the cultivation of one &#145;prominent desire&#146;. He also stresses the role of &#145;domestic happiness&#146; and an ideal of affective marriage.<br>
<br>On political questions Ramsay was a Conservative. In <span class="italic">The Moralist and Politician, or, Many Things in Few Words</span> (1865), a collection of aphoristic writings, he characterizes aristocracy as the connecting link between &#145;monarchy&#146; and &#145;democracy&#146;, without which the constitution &#145;falls to pieces&#146;, on the grounds that aristocrats represent local interests which would be ignored by the absolutist spirit of pure democracy. Ramsay attributes the condition of Ireland to the failure of the Irish aristocracy in <span class="italic">A Proposal for the Restoration of the Irish Parliament</span> (1845).<br>
