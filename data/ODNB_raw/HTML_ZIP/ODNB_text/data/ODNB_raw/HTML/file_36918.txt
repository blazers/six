<span class="headword">Williams,  Charles Walter Stansby</span>  (1886&#150;1945), <span class="occ">writer on literature and theology</span>, was born on 20 September 1886 at 3 Spencer Road, Holloway, London, the surviving member of twins born to Richard Walter Stansby Williams (1848&#150;1929), clerk, and his wife, Mary Wall (1856&#150;1948), daughter of James Wall, cabinet-maker. A sister, Edith, followed in 1889. Charles was baptized in St Anne's, Finsbury Park, Middlesex, on 7 November 1886, and he loved the Church of England all his life. After attending St Albans School he went to the University of London in 1901. He left after two years on financial grounds and began work in the Methodist Book Room. On 9 June 1908 he became a reader with Oxford University Press, London. Williams loved the work, and he endeared himself to his colleagues by his goodness and warmth.<br>
<br>While reading Dante's <span class="italic">Divine Comedy</span> in 1910 Williams became enraptured by the idea of the &#145;Beatrician experience&#146; as a recovery of the vision which would have been common to each of us had man not fallen. In his first book, <span class="italic">The Silver Stair</span> (1912), he explains how earthly love can be a staircase to God. But the fullest expression of this &#145;Romantic love&#146;, as he called it, is found in his Arthurian poems, <span class="italic">Taliessin through Logres</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">The Region of the Summer Stars</span> (1944). The idea is expressed more clearly in Williams's &#145;The theology of Romantic love&#146; from <span class="italic">He Came Down from Heaven</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">The Figure of Beatrice</span> (1943). Perhaps the most lucid explanation of all is C. S. Lewis's commentary on Williams's Arthurian poems in <span class="italic">Arthurian Torso</span> (1948). Williams experienced this love at first hand when he met Florence Sarah (Michal) Conway (1886&#150;1970), a teacher, in 1908. She was the daughter of James Edward Worrall Conway, ironmonger, of St Albans. They married on 12 April 1917 and their one child, Michael Stansby Williams, was born on 18 June 1922.<br>
<br>An interest in magic led Williams to join A. E. Waite's Order of the Golden Dawn in 1917. His fascination for the occult is evident in his early poems, but especially in his novels: <span class="italic">War in Heaven</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Many Dimensions</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The Place of the Lion</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The Greater Trumps</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Shadows of Ecstasy</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Descent into Hell</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">All Hallows' Eve</span> (1945). While some regard the Arthurian poems as the finest of Williams's some forty works, these &#145;spiritual shockers&#146;, as he called them  (Lewis, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, viii), are his most popular.<br>
<br>C. S. Lewis chanced upon <span class="italic">The Place of the Lion</span> in 1936 and liked it greatly. The book's heroine is a complacent medieval researcher who regards herself not so much the student of Abelard and St Bernard as their inspector. All is changed when the Platonic forms of a gigantic lion and other animals suddenly erupt into her world. Lewis wrote to thank Williams, who was on the point of writing a similar letter to Lewis about his <span class="italic">Allegory of Love</span> (1936) which he was proof-reading for Oxford University Press. &#145;After this&#146;, said Lewis, &#145;we soon met and our friendship rapidly grew inward to the bone&#146;  (Lewis, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, viii).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War Williams was among the staff that Oxford University Press transferred from London to Oxford. On 7 September 1939 he moved into 9 South Parks Road, while Michal remained in London. Lewis was delighted to see him, and invited him to join the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92544', "Inklings")</script>, a group of friends who met in Lewis's rooms on Thursday evenings to discuss their writings, and which included J. R. R. Tolkien and Hugo Dyson. &#145;In appearance&#146;, Lewis wrote of Williams,<blockquote>he was tall, slim, and straight as a boy, though grey-haired. His face we thought ugly: I am not sure that the word &#145;monkey&#146; has not been murmured in that context. But the moment he spoke it became, as was also said, like the face of an angel&#151;not a feminine angel in the debased tradition of some religious art, but a masculine angel, a spirit burning with intelligence and charity. (Lewis, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, ix)</blockquote>Oxford's English faculty was depleted by the war, and Williams soon made a reputation as a lecturer and as a private tutor. The lectures he gave on Milton during Hilary term 1940 were greatly admired by Lewis. Writing to his brother about the one he heard on 5 February, he said:<blockquote>C. W. lectured nominally on <span class="italic">Comus</span> but really on Chastity. Simply as criticism it was superb&#151;because here was a man who really started from the same point of view as Milton&#151;That beautiful carved room had probably not witnessed anything so important since some of the great medieval or Reformation lectures. I have at last, if only for once, seen a university doing what it was founded to do: teaching Wisdom. (<span class="italic">Letters of C. S. Lewis</span>, 338)</blockquote>The essence of these lectures survives in Williams's &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">The English Poems of John Milton</span>, edited by H. C. Beeching (1940). On 18 February 1943 Oxford made him an honorary MA.<br>
<br>On 11 May 1945, two days after the war ended, Williams was rushed to the Radcliffe Infirmary with a recurrence of the intussusception for which he was operated on in 1933. He died there of an acute intestinal obstruction on 15 May 1945 and on 18 May he was buried in the cemetery of St Cross Church, Holywell, Oxford.<br>
