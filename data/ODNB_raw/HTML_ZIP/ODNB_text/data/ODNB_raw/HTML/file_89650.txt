<span class="headword">Thrift,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1752), <span class="occ">public executioner and murderer</span>, is of unknown origins and nothing is yet known of his life before he became the common hangman of London. He could not write his own name. His wife, whom he had married by 1748, was named Mary. For much of the 1740s he lived in a house on the Coal Yard, a street in St Giles-in-the-Fields which ran eastwards off Drury Lane and parallel to High Holborn.<br>
<br>Thrift was probably the executioner who, on his first day of office at Tyburn on 10 March 1735, accidentally drew the cart from beneath the gallows before the caps had been pulled over the faces of the condemned. He was certainly in office by 24 May 1736. He hanged four men at Tyburn that day; returning home, he seems to have got into a row with one Mary White. He was committed to Newgate for knocking her down and stealing a pocket containing 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. He was released a fortnight later, and she was gaoled in his place for false accusation. In January 1741 he was again committed to prison for assault, although the case seems to have come to nothing.<br>
<br>Thrift's office and role in the theatre of execution gave him a particular place in the imagination of Londoners. He was Jack Ketch, the nickname given to all London's hangmen after the notorious late-seventeenth-century executioner. He presided at the execution days of felons held up to eight times a year at Tyburn and usually twice a year on Kennington Common, following the Old Bailey sessions and the Surrey assizes respectively. He cut a striking figure at the hanging, drawing, and quartering of convicted traitors, &#145;dress'd in a white frock, with a knife and steel by his side, and a drawn scymetar in his hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Morning Advertiser</span>, 21 Jan 1743). The aftermath of the 'Forty-Five gave him a particularly prominent role. He executed nine Jacobites on Kennington Common on 30 July 1746, among them Francis Towneley. On 18 August he beheaded the earl of Kilmarnock and Lord Balmerino on Tower Hill. Kilmarnock had been assured that Thrift was &#145;a good sort of man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, 16, 1746, 393). Already dosed to stop himself from fainting, Thrift burst into tears when he came to ask the earl's forgiveness. Nevertheless, he was almost able to take Kilmarnock's head off, and certainly to kill him, with one blow. Balmerino was less fortunate: the first blow was too shallow; it took a second to render him insensible and a third to sever the head. On 9 April 1747 Thrift executed the eighty-year-old Lord Lovat, the last public beheading in Britain.<br>
<br>In July 1736 Thrift was beaten up by the Tyburn crowd when he attempted to hang again Thomas Reynolds, who had revived after being cut down and put in his coffin. Inevitably Thrift became caught up in the conflicts that arose over the fate of the bodies of the hanged, between those who sought to rescue the corpse and the surgeons who wanted bodies for dissection. The limited evidence appears to show him siding more with the popular defence of the integrity of the corpse, but is ambiguous. In November 1741 he was summoned before the court of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company, and charged with &#145;obstructing the bodys being brought from Tyburne to the Hall for dissection and threatning to prevent the Company's measures for obtaining the same&#146;  (Young, 358). However, his obstructionism may have been swayed as much by the competing demand of hospitals and private surgeons (far greater than the four bodies a year due to the company) as by the hostility of the crowd. Two years later the Barber&#150;Surgeons gave him his Christmas box.<br>
<br>In March 1748 Thrift and his wife played an equally ambiguous part in the arrest of John Walker, who had helped rescue the body of Francis Hill on the day of execution, only to steal it that night. Mary Thrift went to Hill's sister, telling her that &#145;she heard my brother was sold to a surgeon, that his head was off&#146;. Together the two women went to the surgeon's house, where they found the coffin, upon which &#145;stood the man's head like a barber's block, but not defaced&#146;. Mary Thrift took out a warrant against Walker, and when she and her husband confronted him, he confessed. For the Thrifts there was no doubt an element of self-interest; Walker's body-snatching had deprived the hangman of his right to the victim's clothes, a right acknowledged not only by Mary Thrift but by the dead man's sister, who recognized that &#145;Mr. Thrift had nothing for executing him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Proceedings</span>, 20 April 1748). Moreover, Mary Thrift may have been so active in pursuing the matter because John had already been approached by Hill's sister, who clearly thought that the hangman was involved in the disappearance of the body.<br>
<br>Although his name does not appear among those, over thirty in all, who have been identified as thief-takers in mid-eighteenth-century London, it seems likely that on occasion Thrift deployed his authority and knowledge to perform some of the parts associated with that trade: making the occasional arrest, appearing as a witness, acting as a broker between criminals and the authorities, and using his position to shield thieves and to help fence stolen goods. In June 1748 he arrested Elizabeth Haymour for stealing forty shillings from a lodger in her master's house and heard her confession before the magistrate. Five years earlier Thrift had testified at the trial of the thirteen-year-old Evy (or Evan) Evans for stealing silver spoons. The boy had tried to sell one of the spoons to a silversmith, telling him that he had found it in the street. Thrift swore that Evans had come to his house and said that &#145;he would give me a shilling to go with him to get the bowl of a spoon which was stopped, and to say I was his father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Proceedings</span>, 29 June 1743). Even as he told it in court, Thrift's story only makes sense if Evans had some reason to believe that he was somebody who could help in fencing stolen goods. In 1750 a hostile commentator posited Thrift as a potential successor to Jonathan Wild, the notorious thief-taker general of thirty years before.<br>
<br>On the evening of 11 March 1750 four Irish friends were walking past Thrift's house in the Coal Yard. According to his testimony the men made accusations that Thrift was a thief: &#145;that is Jack Ketch, he stole a gold watch, and two silver spoons, and has broke out of Newgate &hellip; there was ten guineas reward for taking of me&#146;. Words turned to blows. The Irish witnesses later claimed that they were innocent victims of Thrift's violence; Thrift and his allies claimed that they attacked him with sticks. The quarrel culminated in Thrift getting a scimitar out of his house and chasing two of the Irishmen across Drury Lane. He caught up with them at Short's Gardens, where one, David Faris, slipped on some dung. There, in front of the large crowd which had gathered, Thrift hacked away, inflicting five wounds to the head and one to the left wrist. Thrift surrendered himself to the constable who, &#145;afraid of a mob &hellip; bid him walk before&#146; and carried him before the magistrate Henry Fielding. His victim died of his wounds eight days later  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Proceedings</span>, 25 April 1750).<br>
<br>Thrift was tried at the Old Bailey on 25 April 1750. Despite his efforts to muddy the matter as to whether he had even struck the fatal blows, he was found guilty and sentenced to death, commuted to fourteen years' transportation a month later. His fate inevitably acquired a political edge. A cartoon, <span class="italic">Squire Ketch in Horrors, or, The Sneering Apparitions</span>, gleefully showed Thrift in the condemned cell recoiling in terror as his Jacobite victims confronted him, led by the three lords, their grinning severed heads in their hands. Thrift himself played the Jacobite card as he begged the cabinet for a pardon: &#145;The persons &hellip; who sought the quarrel with your petitioner were some Irish papists whose only pretence was his having done his duty in beheading the rebell Lords&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 36/113, fol. 62<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Thrift eventually received a full pardon, but only in mid-September, almost five months after his conviction. The opposition journal <span class="italic">Old England</span> acidly hinted at the political motives behind its granting. The murder was no doubt a loyal pre-emptive strike. His prosecutors were &#145;Irish, native Irish of the old stock; consequently Papists; consequently Jacobites&#146;, and &#145;the taking off another Jacobite, an inveterate enemy to the present establishment, was in truth no more than pursuing the business of my hero's occupation&#146;. Pardoned, Thrift &#145;lives <i>in terrorem</i> to all Jacobites&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old England</span>, 22 Sept 1750).<br>
<br>Thrift was quickly reinstated, whipping two women at the cart's tail in late September. On 3 October he hanged twelve felons at Tyburn, among them the highwayman James Maclaine. John Thrift died on 5 May 1752, presumably in his parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields. He was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, on the evening of 11 May. A hostile crowd followed the hearse, &#145;so displeased with his being buried there, that the attendants of the funeral &hellip; were afraid that the body would be torn out of the coffin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Covent-Garden Journal</span>, 16 May 1752). For safety they took the coffin into the church, and only about 8 p.m. did they feel able to bury him in the graveyard.<br>
