<span class="headword">Dickson, Sir  James Robert</span>  (1832&#150;1901), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born at Plymouth, England, on 30 November 1832, the only son of James Dickson and his wife, Mary Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer. He was educated at the Glasgow high school, then worked as a clerk in the City of Glasgow Bank. In 1854 he emigrated to Victoria, entering the Bank of Australasia, and on 8 November 1855 he married Annie Ely (1838&#150;1880); his second wife was Mary MacKinlay (1841&#150;1900), whom he married on 5 January 1882. About 1859 he joined his merchant cousin's firm, Rae Dickson &amp; Co. In 1862 he moved to Queensland, working with an estate agent; in the early 1870s Dickson opened his own firm which actively participated in the subdivision and building boom that characterized the development of Brisbane, especially in the early 1880s. As a leading auctioneer he held executive positions in four financial and property institutions.<br>
<br>Dickson was elected to the legislative assembly in 1873, winning the seat of Enoggera. He was appointed secretary for public works and mines in 1876, then treasurer, until 1879. After a trip to England, on 31 December 1883 he was chosen (for his commercial experience and as a friend) as colonial treasurer in the Griffith ministry. Here he was involved in obtaining large overseas loans, especially for railways and immigration. He resigned in 1887 in protest against Griffith's proposed land tax, which, since it was to be levied on freehold only, Dickson considered to be a &#145;class tax with a vengeance&#146;. Standing for re-election he won handsomely, but at the general elections of 1888 he was defeated for the seat of Toombul.<br>
<br>After a stay in Europe between 1889 and 1891, Dickson returned to political life in Queensland. Aligned with the ministerialist cause, he promoted the issue of resuming the importation of Melanesian indentured labourers to work the sugar fields. In a by-election in 1892 he won the seat of Bulimba. He resumed ministerial rank in 1897 as secretary for railways; later postmaster-general was added. In 1898 he was appointed home secretary. When premier Byrnes died suddenly, Dickson, as a stopgap measure, was chosen as premier, chief secretary, and home secretary on 1 October 1898. He held these posts until 1 December 1899.<br>
<br>In 1899 Dickson played a most influential role in bringing Queensland into the federation of the Australian colonies. Although he had been a Queensland representative at meetings of the federal council of Australasia in 1886, 1888, and 1897, from the mid-1890s there had been a general waning of interest in federation on the part of Queenslanders. While attending the premiers' conference on federation held at Melbourne in January 1899, Dickson secured two amendments in Queensland's favour. At the elections held in 1899 his manifesto proclaimed that federation should be accepted by the people on the &#145;broad basis of national will&#146;. Through strenuous electioneering and political promises he helped considerably to obtain a &#145;yes&#146; vote at the referendum held in September. He was chosen in 1900 as Queensland's representative among the Australian delegates attending the London meeting where the final details of the new commonwealth were worked out. Here Dickson stood apart from senior Australian colleagues in his desire to retain some form of appeal to the privy council.<br>
<br>Although generally a staunch supporter of Griffith's liberal approach, much of Dickson's political thinking was governed by considerations of expediency. He was also a keen advocate of the imperial cause; accordingly, in 1899 he readily committed Queensland troops to the South African War. Described as &#145;rather sententious in manner&#146;, as &#145;stiff and punctilious&#146;, and a &#145;tedious and monotonous&#146; speaker with a &#145;complaining or querulous&#146; tone, Dickson was also noted as being capable and courteous, and wisely attentive to the press. He enjoyed a full life, residing most of his time in Toorak House, 16 Anne Street, Hamilton, Brisbane; and he was a very staunch high-church Anglican. He was appointed CMG in 1897 and KCMG in 1901, and he was chosen to be the first minister of defence in Barton's new federal administration. He travelled to Sydney for the inauguration celebrations, became ill, and died on 10 January 1901 at the Australian Club, Sydney, after attending the first cabinet meeting. He was buried in the Nundah cemetery, Brisbane, and was survived by six sons and seven daughters of his first marriage.<br>
