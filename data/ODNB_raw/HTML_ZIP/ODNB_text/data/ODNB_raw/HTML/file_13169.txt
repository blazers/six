<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heydon,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1629, <em>d.</em> in or after 1670), <span class="occ">writer on astrology and alchemy, and occultist</span>, was born on 10 September 1629 in Green Arbour, London, the son of Francis Heydon of Sidmouth, Devon, and Mary Chandler of Worcestershire. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13166/', "Sir Christopher Heydon")</script> of the Norfolk branch of the family, author of the learned and influential <span class="italic">A Defence of Judiciall Astrologie</span> (1603). He was privately educated at either Tardebigg, Worcestershire, or Golton, Warwickshire, or both. The civil war, in which his father became lieutenant-general of the ordnance to Charles I, ended his intention to attend university. His claim to have commanded a troop of royalist cavalry, though, must be accepted (as with many of his own accounts) with reservations; he would have been aged thirteen.<br>
<br>In 1651 Heydon travelled abroad, perhaps as far as Spain, Italy, Egypt, and Turkey, and the following year returned and, after studying the law, was articled as an attorney at Clifford's Inn. By 1655 he was practising law at the court of king's bench, and began writing his first books (though these were not published until later). He must also have been practising astrology, however, because in 1657 or 1658 he was imprisoned in Lambeth House for foretelling Cromwell's death from his nativity. According to a letter written to the duke of Ormond on 2 March 1667, Richard Cromwell and John Thurloe went to him disguised as cavaliers and asked him for his prediction, and it was as a result of this that he was imprisoned.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1656 Heydon married Alice Culpeper, widow of the famous astrologer&#150;physician and radical, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6882/', "Nicholas Culpeper")</script>. He moved into her house in Spitalfields, near Bishopsgate, next door to the Red Lion. In July 1663 he was again imprisoned for several weeks&#151;this time, despite his staunch royalism, by Charles II for &#145;seditious practices&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1663</i>). He was released at the instigation of the duke of Buckingham, but repeated the experience on 23 January 1667. This time he and the duke were both arrested for suspicion of plotting, the charge against Heydon being that he had obliged Buckingham by astrologically inferring the date of the king's death.<br>
<br>Tantalizingly, the <span class="italic">Calendar of State Papers</span> for February 1667 also records &#145;Astrological predictions on the questions to Peter [<i>sic</i>] Heydon, astrologer of London, as to whether the fanatics shall have toleration in England, and whether the English may be compelled to a neutral place for a treaty of peace&#146;. His predictions were apparently in the affirmative. The record continues with the statement that &#145;though these answers are according to the rules of his art, he is committed to the Tower for them&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1666&#150;7</i>, 541).<br>
<br>Heydon stoutly maintained his innocence, and when the evidence became increasingly threadbare the case was dropped. It seems to have been an attempt by Lord Arlington to get his rival, Buckingham&#151;and, as the latter's ally, Heydon&#151;out of the way. At Heydon's arrest, an inventory of his goods noted five hundred books, a sword and an expensive watch; the latter two articles ended up in the possession of the paid witness against him.<br>
<br>The last thing written by Heydon is dated 1670. There are no reports of him afterwards, and nothing is known of when or how he died. His chief books are: <span class="italic">A New Method of Rosicrucian Physick</span> (1658); <span class="italic">The Rosie Crucian</span> (1660), which supplies a Rosicrucian&#150;Pythagorean cosmogony; <span class="italic">The English Physitians Guide, or, A Holy Guide</span> (1662), his principal work of alchemical and mystical medicine; <span class="italic">The Harmony of the World</span> (1662), his main metaphysical work which outlines his Neoplatonic cosmos; <span class="italic">Theomagia, or, The Temple of Wisdome</span> (1664), which contains much astrological material; and <span class="italic">The Wise Man's Crown, or, The Glory of the Rosie Cross</span> (1664) and <span class="italic">El havareuna, or, The English Physician's Tutor</span> (1665), both of which concentrate on alchemy. He occasionally used a Rosicrucian pen-name, Eugenius Theodidactus.<br>
<br>All these works are essentially variations on a single theme: Rosicrucianism as a universal wisdom and, as such, the way to an ultimate spiritual, physical, and social harmony. Heydon never claimed to be a member of the Rosicrucian brotherhood, a mysterious group whose actual existence has been questioned, and whose supposed &#145;manifestos&#146; of 1614&#150;15 were first translated into English in 1652 by Thomas Vaughan. Rather he was an apologist and publicist for Rosicrucian ideas&#151;which is to say, an amalgam of Neoplatonism, hermeticism, the cabbala, Pythagoras, Paracelsian medicine, alchemy, and astrology. To that end, he borrowed heavily, and usually without acknowledgements, from Thomas Vaughan, Francis Bacon, Sir Thomas Browne, Cornelius Agrippa (on occult philosophy), Paracelsus (on medicine), Elias Ashmole (on alchemy), and William Lilly (on astrology). For Heydon, the resulting philosophy, with its spiritual sympathies and antipathies, mystical number symbolism, and hierarchies of spirits linking any number of earthly phenomena (and ultimately ruled by God, as the One), supplied medicines equally for society, the individual soul, and the physical body, all of which were ultimately reflections of the divine order.<br>
<br>The context for Heydon's arguments was the extraordinarily fertile and chaotic intellectual milieu of England in the mid-seventeenth century, in which the new mechanical and experimental philosophies, the old Aristotelianism, and the magico-religious world-view and practices of the radical sectaries, were all contending for supremacy. For many of his contemporaries, he apparently embodied much of the latter, with its &#145;Familistical-Levelling-Magical temper&#146;  (Hall, 199) stigmatized, especially after 1660, as &#145;enthusiasm&#146;. With William Lilly, Heydon was a model for the astrologer Mopus in John Wilson's popular play of 1663, <span class="italic">The Cheats</span>. On a more learned level, he was attacked by name in the bishop of Oxford, Samuel Parker's, <span class="italic">A Free and Impartial Censure of the Platonick Philosophy</span> (1667), and by implication in Robert Boyle's <span class="italic">Free Inquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature</span> (1665), despite (or perhaps on account of) Heydon's syncretic gesture towards Boyle's belief in the production of terrestrial phenomena by the motions of corpuscles.<br>
<br>Ironically, Heydon himself was far from being a radical sectary but was a lifelong, even fanatical, monarchist, who believed (to put it crudely) that a king was necessary to reflect the power of God. His monarchism and relatively well-born social status were insufficient, however, to overcome the political suspicions engendered by his &#145;enthusiastic&#146; religious and metaphysical cosmology. At the same time, his politics set him at odds with the radical groupings who were similarly inclined to magic, alchemy, and astrology.<br>
<br>Heydon's earlier books were apparently commended by the astrologers John Gadbury and John Booker, although there is an element of doubt, since according to John Aubrey, Heydon was not above pirating praise composed for other authors' books; within a few years, however, he was attacking and being criticized by both Lilly and Booker. He even denounced Paracelsus and Jakob Boehme, despite his borrowings from them, probably for having drawn unacceptably &#145;levelling&#146; conclusions from their Neoplatonic premisses. &#145;The recent years of the [Cromwellian] tyranny&#146;, he complained, &#145;admitted stocking-weavers, shoe-makers, millers, masons, carpenters, bricklayers, gunsmiths, porters, butlers, etc. to write and teach astrology and physick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theomagia</span>, 1664, C3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>To add to the complexity of his position and seal his almost complete isolation, Heydon was himself, despite his adherence to hierarchy and his contempt for the sectaries, something of a populist in his approach. <span class="italic">The Rosie Crucian</span> contained &#145;Infallible Axiomata, or, Generall Rules to know all things past, present, and to come&#146;  (title-page) and <span class="italic">The Harmony of the World</span> described itself as &#145;a Discourse wherein the Phaenomenoa of Nature are Consonantly Salved and Adapted to Inferior Intellects&#146;  (title-page). Perhaps this was simply an attempt to spread the word and promote his programme, or perhaps it was partly compelled by the general hostility he met at a more learned level; in any case, together with his inveterate plagiarism and flamboyant self-promotion, the result was to alienate his last potential allies, namely conservative and royalist occultists such as Gadbury and Ashmole. The latter dismissed him as &#145;an ignoramus and a cheate&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), a verdict that was probably widely accepted at the time, but has too readily obscured Heydon's complexity and historical interest.<br>
