<span class="headword">Szabo <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bushell]</span>,  Violette Reine Elizabeth</span>  (1921&#150;1945), <span class="occ">special operations officer</span>, was born in Paris on 26 June 1921, the second child and only daughter in the family of five children of Charles George Bushell, a regular soldier, and his wife, Reine Blanche Leroy, a dressmaker from Pont-R&eacute;my, Somme, France. He held various jobs in France and England before settling in 1932 in Brixton as a secondhand motor car dealer. From her mother's family Violette picked up fluent French, spoken with an English accent. She left the London county council school in Stockwell Road, Brixton, at fourteen to work as a shop assistant. She was under 5 feet 5 inches tall, but strikingly good-looking, with dark hair and eyes and vivacious manners.<br>
<br>Violette married in Aldershot, on 21 August 1940, &Eacute;tienne Michel Ren&eacute; Szabo, a thirty-year-old Frenchman of Hungarian descent from Marseilles, who had fought in Norway with the French Foreign Legion and elected to join General de Gaulle's nascent Free French forces. He was soon posted to north Africa, and never met their only child, Tania, a daughter born on 8 June 1941. He died on 27 October 1942 from wounds received the previous day in battle.<br>
<br>To avenge him, his widow joined the independent French section of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in October 1943. During the usual paramilitary, parachute, and security training it emerged that Szabo was an admirable shot. She parachuted twice into occupied France, each time as courier to Philippe Liewer, an experienced agent. Her first mission began on 5&#150;6 April 1944. They found that the Gestapo had broken up Liewer's former group of saboteur friends between Rouen and Le Havre; they returned to England by light aircraft on 30 April. Between her first and second missions she was commissioned an ensign in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry.<br>
<br>Szabo and Liewer returned to France on 7&#150;8 June 1944 to set up a new group of resisters between Limoges and P&eacute;rigueux. On 10 June she and two companions, in a motor car, encountered a German road block at Salon-la-Tour, some 30 miles south-east of Limoges. Both sides opened fire. According to her George Cross citation Szabo, armed only with a sten sub-machine gun, covered her companions' retreat through standing corn for twenty minutes until she had no more ammunition and was taken prisoner. (Another version of her capture has suggested that she tripped, fell, and was captured unarmed.) Brutal interrogations got nothing out of her but contempt.<br>
<br>On 8 August, handcuffed to a neighbour on a train bound for Germany, Szabo crawled round offering water to her fellow prisoners while the train was under attack by the Royal Air Force. She was put in Ravensbr&uuml;ck concentration camp, whence she went with two SOE colleagues, Lilian Rolfe and Denise Bloch, on a working party at Torgau. For some infraction they were then sent to a punishment camp some 60 miles eastward, at Klein K&ouml;nigsberg. Even her tremendously high spirits were lowered by its regime. Her companions returned from it hardly able to stand; she was not much sturdier. About 27 January 1945, shortly after their return to Ravensbr&uuml;ck, all three were shot dead. Szabo was awarded a French Croix de Guerre in 1944, and a posthumous George Cross. This was presented to the four-year-old Tania in 1946.<br>
<br>Violette Szabo's wartime exploits were immortalized in 1958 in a film, <span class="italic">Carve her Name with Pride</span> (from the book of that name by R. J. Minney). The role of Violette was taken by Virginia McKenna. A commemorative blue plaque was placed on her home at 18 Burnley Road, Stockwell, London, and early in 2000 a museum about her was opened at Cartref, her uncle's home in Wormelow, near Hereford.<br>
