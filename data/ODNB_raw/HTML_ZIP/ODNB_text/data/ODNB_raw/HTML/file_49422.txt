<span class="headword">Wulfsige</span> <span class="st"> [St Wulfsige]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1002), <span class="occ">abbot of Westminster and bishop of Sherborne</span>, is the subject of a life written by Goscelin of St Bertin in the late eleventh century. A short description of his life was also provided by William of Malmesbury in his <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>, but both Goscelin and William were writing too long after his death for their information to be necessarily reliable, and William's version in particular is open to question. Even less reliable is the account of Wulfsige's life by the fifteenth-century historian of Westminster Abbey, John Flete, who conflates Goscelin's account with details drawn from forged charters for Westminster.<br>
<br>According to Goscelin, Wulfsige was born in London and his parents gave him while he was still a child to the community of Westminster. This is plausible: Wulfsige had strong connections with London (one of his posthumous miracles concerned a London woman), he certainly became a member of the community at Westminster and, while Goscelin possibly might, as a Benedictine, have invented the idea of his oblation, none the less entry in childhood into non-monastic communities was just as normal as it was into monastic ones. The date of Wulfsige's birth is unknown. If William of Malmesbury's statement that he became abbot of Westminster while Dunstan was bishop of London (958&#150;61) were to be accepted, it would have to be assumed that he was born no later than <i>c</i>.925. However, it is likely that on this point William misinterpreted Goscelin, who said that Wulfsige (who had previously risen through the clerical grades in due order and been ordained priest when of &#145;mature age&#146;) was made abbot of Westminster by King Edgar (<i>r</i>. 959&#150;75, but king of Mercia from 957), who, says Goscelin, was as ever following the advice of Dunstan in all appointments of bishops and abbots. William might have wished to suggest that Wulfsige had been promoted by his diocesan rather than by a secular ruler. On the basis of Goscelin's account the date of birth might lie anywhere between the 920s and the 940s.<br>
<br>John Flete states that Wulfsige was put in charge of Westminster by Dunstan in 958, but that the latter retained the abbacy until 980, and that it was only at this point that Wulfsige was made abbot. Flete's dates cannot be trusted, but even so it is likely that Dunstan was abbot of Westminster during most if not all of Edgar's reign, and it is noteworthy that, apart from the narrative sources and a spurious charter of Edgar of 966  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 741), the earliest occurrences of Wulfsige as abbot of Westminster are in charters of 988  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 868) and 989/990  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 877). Goscelin attributes to Wulfsige the conversion of Westminster into a Benedictine community, but a charter of Edgar for Westminster surviving in a contemporary though mutilated form  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 670) shows that Dunstan was responsible.<br>
<br>Goscelin states that Wulfsige retained the abbacy of Westminster for a while after his elevation to the see of Sherborne in, it has been argued, the summer of 993. He ceased to be abbot in or before 997 when his successor first appears. As bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige was anxious to spread the ideals of the tenth-century Benedictine reform more widely. Goscelin tells that he converted his cathedral community to monastic observance, probably by 998, the date of the Sherborne foundation charter, issued by &AElig;thelred  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 895). This charter has some unusual features but is probably genuine; it imposes the Benedictine rule, and lists the estates which were to be specifically attached to the monks. A charter purporting to have been issued by Wulfsige giving the monks permission to inherit the possessions of the clerks they had displaced is, however, a post-conquest forgery  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1382). Wulfsige's zeal for Benedictine monasticism also found expression in his instructions to the clergy of his diocese, for whom he commissioned a letter on pastoral care from &AElig;lfric of Eynsham. Although addressed to secular clergy, the letter advocates a model of life strongly influenced by the aims of the Benedictine reform, for &AElig;lfric tells clerics to be chaste and to live according to a rule (perhaps the enlarged rule of Chrodegang, though this is not specified), and holds out to them monastic obedience to the rule of Benedict as an ideal. Furthermore, he provides detailed instructions about liturgical practice, perhaps the aspect of ecclesiastical life in which tenth-century reformers took most interest. The priests in the diocese of Sherborne were each expected to possess a psalter, a book of epistles, an evangeliary, a missal, antiphonals, a manual, a computus, a passional, a penitential, and a reading-book. &AElig;lfric gave detailed instructions for prayer, at least some, if not all, of which may have come from Wulfsige, since there is reference to bishops making decisions at a synod.<br>
<br>A tangible sign of Wulfsige's influence in liturgical matters is the Sherborne pontifical  (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 943), written at Canterbury in the late tenth century and procured for Sherborne, probably by Wulfsige, in or by the early eleventh century. Into this manuscript were entered a letter by an anonymous archbishop to Wulfsige, exhorting him to be a good diocesan, and two letters by Wulfsige concerning penance to be performed by those who had killed close relatives. On 20 June 1001 Wulfsige presided over the translation of Edward the Martyr at Shaftesbury. He died on 8 January, his feast day, almost certainly in 1002, since his successor, &AElig;thelric, first appears in that year. He was buried in a <i>porticus</i> in his cathedral at Sherborne and was translated twelve years later to a position at the right side of the altar.<br>
