<span class="headword">Pirie,  Alexander</span>  (1736/7&#150;1804), <span class="occ">Secession church and Independent minister</span>, had a controversial career in which he proved divisive in three ecclesiastical bodies. Of his origins, early education, and family nothing is known, but from 1756 he was schooled in philosophy and theology under Alexander Moncrieff in the Anti-Burgher branch of the Secession church in Abernethy, Perthshire. In 1760 he was appointed Moncrieff's assistant to teach philosophy, and was licensed as a probationer in September 1762 with a view to missionary service in America. In April 1763 he pleaded illness to excuse himself for not fulfilling this commission, but by then his teaching was under suspicion. On 1 and 2 September 1763 he answered charges before the Anti-Burgher synod of recommending &#145;several erroneous books&#146; (the only one named was <span class="italic">Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion</span>, by Henry Home, Lord Kames), espousing a theory of necessity inconsistent with human responsibility and divine sovereignty (allegedly drawn from Kames), and subverting students. His irreverence contributed to the synod's sentence of deprivation of licence and &#145;lesser excommunication&#146;.<br>
<br>Supporters in the Abernethy congregation adhered to Pirie's unauthorized preaching and sought his ordination. This he obtained from the Burgher Presbytery of Perth on 17 July 1765, to serve the newly constituted Burgher congregation in Abernethy. But his <span class="italic">Essay on National Covenanting</span> (1766) and careless expressions about the humanity of Christ resulted in his suspension by the presbytery on 27 June 1767. Although in May 1768 the synod on appeal referred the case back on procedural grounds, Pirie published his abandonment of secession principles in <span class="italic">A Review of the Principles and Conduct of the Seceders</span> (1769) and took his leave, with his followers' continuing adherence.<br>
<br>Pirie was next courted by the Relief church congregation of Blairlogie, near Stirling, but he was a marked man. The Relief Presbytery disapproved of the invitation and soon divided on congregational freedom of ministerial choice. Pirie became Blairlogie's unapproved minister on 19 August 1770. His repeated rejection by the presbytery was followed by another parting, on 14 June 1778, and Blairlogie's allegiance to the Relief was regularized.<br>
<br>Pirie moved finally to Newburgh, Fife, near Abernethy, home to sundry dissenting groups. He sold medicine and ministered to a small Independent church (the Congregational Society), perhaps with Glasite connections. He died there suddenly on 23 November 1804, aged sixty-seven.<br>
<br>Six volumes of his <span class="italic">Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works</span> (1805&#150;6) display his range and vigour. Things first (<span class="roman">Genesis</span>) and last (<span class="roman">Revelation</span>) were a special interest. Separately published were most of his pamphlet contributions to his own ecclesiastical trials; his <span class="italic">Psalms or Hymns</span> (1777), of which some fourteen found wider use in the Relief's <span class="italic">Sacred Songs and Hymns</span> (1794); and <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Hebrew Roots</span> (1807).<br>
