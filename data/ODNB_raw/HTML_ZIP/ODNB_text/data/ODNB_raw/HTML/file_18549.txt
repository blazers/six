<span class="headword">Melville, Sir  John, of Raith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1548), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the elder son of John Melville of Raith (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1494), and his wife, Janet Bonar (<i>d</i>. in or after 1506). In 1502 he succeeded his grandfather William Melville as laird of Raith, and by 1506 he had been knighted (perhaps at James IV's wedding celebrations in 1503). He married twice. With Margaret Wemyss, whom he married about 1503, he is known only to have had a daughter, Janet, who married Sir James Kirkcaldy of Grange. With Helen Napier (<i>d</i>. in or after 1584), whom he probably married about 1525, he had nine sons and two daughters. He also had an illegitimate son, John, begotten in England.<br>
<br>A handsome and plausible man, able to frame his face to all occasions, Melville is said to have fought at Flodden in 1513. Having survived the Scottish defeat, in the 1520s he charmed the sixth earl of Angus, who in October 1526 appointed him master of the Royal Artillery for life, even though a month earlier Melville had joined the earl of Lennox in trying to release the young James V from Angus's custody. After the coup failed Melville had to plead for a pardon, which he obtained on 14 August 1527. A year later Angus was banished by James, who clearly did not regard Melville as seriously compromised by his links with the fallen regime, for he several times employed him on justice ayres. A more serious handicap was probably an extended feud, beginning in 1527, with John Moultray of Markinch and Seafield, whose father had been killed by Melvilles, causing much violence and several deaths. The quarrel was eventually settled in 1534 after the king's intervention. In 1533 Melville had accompanied James to the borders when war with England threatened, and he also served on the assizes which condemned Lady Glamis in 1537 and Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in 1540. Described in the latter year as the king's &#145;lovit familiar servitour&#146;  (Fraser, 1.53), he was made captain of Dunbar Castle, the greatest strength north of the border at this time, and in that capacity had custody of highland chiefs arrested on James's expedition to the Western Isles.<br>
<br>Like many other Fife gentry, including his own son-in-law Kirkcaldy of Grange, Melville was won over to the cause of religious reform, so much so that he features among the martyrs in John Johnston's <span class="italic">Heroes ex omni historia Scotica lectissimi</span> (1603). In 1540 he was named in the list of heretics that Cardinal David Beaton presented to the king, recommending that James confiscate their lands and goods. No action followed, and Melville remained captain of Dunbar until about the end of 1542, after the king's death. Melville was later one of the landowners whose support the cardinal tried to buy with grants of church land, and in 1544 Mary of Guise appears to have regarded him as at least a potential supporter. There is no evidence that Melville was involved in Beaton's assassination, on 29 May 1546, though he was later suspected of gaining possession of some of the dead cardinal's valuables. In the meantime he had travelled widely, in England as well as in Scotland. He clearly favoured an English marriage for Mary, queen of Scots, and appears to have worked for an English victory.<br>
<br>Melville's bastard son John had been involved in the plot against Beaton, and subsequently withdrew to England, where he became an agent for Protector Somerset. He received letters from his father, in one of which, sent in January 1548, Sir John gave information of Scottish military affairs, telling how the fourth earl of Argyll was advancing on Dundee, which was then in English hands. A month later this letter, and perhaps others, fell into the hands of the governor of Scotland, the second earl of Arran, when Arran captured the tower-house of John Cockburn of Ormiston. Arran sat on this highly incriminating evidence for months and then struck, at the beginning of December. Melville was arrested by servants of the Scottish treasurer, John Hamilton, abbot of Paisley, and taken to Edinburgh, where he was tried and condemned on 13 December. The charge sheet stretched far and wide. Melville's &#145;lese maiestie&#146; included aiding the &#145;evill and mischevous purpois and effaris of &hellip; Henrie the aucht King of Ingland&#146;. He had allegedly behaved traitorously since the end of 1542 (&#145;continewalie sen the deceis of oure said ladiis umquhile derrest fader&#146;). In particular he had revealed the &#145;secretis&#146; of the realm in the first half of 1546, and had also given warning of Argyll's &#145;starklie&#146; descent upon Dundee at the end of the following year.<br>
<br>Executed by hanging on the day of his trial, Melville's head was set &#145;upoun ane prik upoun the tolbuith&#146; and his body was dismembered, with &#145;every quarter put upoun ane port of the said burgh of Edinbur, to the sycht of the peple&#146;  (Fraser, 3.103&#150;4). On 14 December all his possessions were escheated to the crown, but on 4 June 1563 his forfeiture was rescinded, enabling his widow and children to recover their inheritance. His sons included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18550/', "Robert Melville")</script>, who was made first Lord Melville in 1616, the memoirist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18548/', "Sir James Melville")</script> of Halhill, Sir Andrew Melville of Garvock, who became master of Queen Mary's household and accompanied her to England, and William, commendator of Tongland.<br>
