<span class="headword">Wulfstan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 955/6), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, of unknown family, was the first of that name to hold the see; he was archbishop from some time between 3 April and 30 June 931 until his death. Throughout his career he showed a marked readiness to support various viking ventures against the English crown. There are chronological discrepancies between accounts of his activities in various northern annals and his signatures to royal diplomas of the English kings; on the whole, the evidence of the charters is to be preferred.<br>
<br>Wulfstan witnessed King &AElig;thelstan's charters regularly until 21 December 934. Later charters of &AElig;thelstan have greatly abbreviated witness lists, in which the northern sees, including York, are unrepresented; it seems likely that he had lost effective control of the north. After &AElig;thelstan's death in October 939, York was occupied by &Oacute;l&aacute;f Guthfrithson, king of Dublin. Archbishop Wulfstan may have enthroned &Oacute;l&aacute;f; certainly he became his supporter, travelling with him the following year on an expedition into the midlands. &Oacute;l&aacute;f and Wulfstan were besieged by King Edmund at Leicester, but Wulfstan, together with Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, arranged a treaty by which Edmund surrendered to &Oacute;l&aacute;f the territory of the Five Boroughs (Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, and Stamford), and Watling Street was fixed as King Edmund's new northern boundary. In the following year &Oacute;l&aacute;f died, and the kingdom of York passed into the hands of his cousin, &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson. In 942 King Edmund regained control of the Five Boroughs, and for a brief period Wulfstan witnessed his charters. Ragnall, &Oacute;l&aacute;f Guthfrithson's brother, was then made king of York, and no surviving charter of King Edmund issued in 943 is witnessed by Wulfstan. According to &AElig;thelweard's chronicle, however, in 944 Wulfstan drove Ragnall out of York, and King Edmund regained possession of the city. From then onwards Wulfstan's signature appears regularly on King Edmund's diplomas.<br>
<br>After Edmund's death, his brother Eadred became king of England and secured Wulfstan's allegiance at Tanshelf, Yorkshire, in 947; but according to the chroniclers, Wulfstan was quick to break his oath. This alleged treachery is not reflected immediately in King Eadred's charters, which Wulfstan continued to witness until 950, though Erik Bloodaxe had gained temporary control of York in 948: Wulfstan witnessed all but three of the fifteen charters of King Eadred surviving for the years 948&#150;9, and the sole surviving charter of 950. From 951 onwards, however, Wulfstan again ceased to witness Eadred's charters, and it seems that he was out of contact with his court during most of the period in which &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson, having displaced Erik from York, was reigning there for the second time.<br>
<br>Wulfstan's subsequent career can be followed in outline from late Northumbrian annals, originating at York and preserved in writings attributed to Symeon of Durham and the D text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; but his charter subscriptions suggest that these annals have an unsatisfactory chronology for the years 951&#150;6. Probably in 953, Wulfstan was imprisoned by King Eadred at &#145;Iudanbyrig&#146;. His restoration to a bishopric, at Dorchester, should perhaps be assigned to early 955. For the rest of his life Wulfstan seems to have remained in the south. He witnessed as archbishop a number of King Eadred's charters issued in 955, but it appears unlikely that he was able to exercise jurisdiction in the northern archdiocese. According to a retrospective statement in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> (s. a. 970, text B), Bishop Oscytel of Dorchester was given nominal charge of York late in Eadred's reign, by the king &#145;and all his witan&#146;. King Eadred died on 23 November 955. Wulfstan appears as witness to two early charters of his successor, King Eadwig, but doubts have been voiced as to their authenticity. Wulfstan died and was buried at Oundle, Northamptonshire, in the diocese of Dorchester. The date of his death is disputed; the most likely date appears to be 26 December 956, but 955 cannot be completely ruled out.<br>
