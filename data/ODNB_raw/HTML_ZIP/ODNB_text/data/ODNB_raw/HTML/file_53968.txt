<span class="headword">Lushington,  Vernon</span>  (1832&#150;1912), <span class="occ">lawyer and positivist</span>, was born on 8 March 1832 in London, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17213/', "Stephen Lushington (1782&#150;1873)")</script> and his wife, Sarah Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carr, and twin to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38727/', "Sir Godfrey Lushington")</script>, whom he closely resembled in appearance, abilities, and temperament. After their mother's death in 1837, the twins were brought up by a maternal aunt at their father's seat in Ockham Park, Ripley, Surrey, and spent a year at Cheam School. Vernon served for three years in the Royal Navy, studied at the East India College, Haileybury, and in 1852 matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a first class in civil law in 1854&#150;5, LLB in 1859, and LLM in 1885. Admitted to the Inner Temple in 1852, he was called to the bar in 1857.<br>
<br>Early expressions of Lushington's social conscience were a pamphlet of 1855 defending the Crimean War as &#145;a fight for justice&#146;, journalism supporting trade union legislation, and relief efforts for unemployed factory operatives. He also taught at the Working Men's College, founded by his father's friend F. D. Maurice, and published in its magazine. His genial spirits were much admired by his colleagues, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whose fateful introduction to Edward Burne-Jones Lushington arranged. In the <span class="italic">Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</span> (1856), founded by Burne-Jones and William Morris, Lushington wrote on paintings by Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown and a series on Thomas Carlyle.<br>
<br>Lushington's legal career progressed steadily. In 1864 and 1868 he published reports of Admiralty court cases during the years of his father's eminence as an Admiralty judge. In 1868 he took silk and the next year became a bencher. From 1864 to 1869 he was deputy judge-advocate-general, and in 1869 he became secretary to the Admiralty. Upon his retirement in 1877 he was named a county court judge for Surrey and Berkshire, and served until 1900. Independently, he monitored abuses of martial law.<br>
<br>Both Lushington twins adopted Auguste Comte's positivism in the 1870s, and participated in the joint translation of Comte's four-volume <span class="italic">Positive Polity</span> (1875&#150;7) under Richard Congreve. A few years later they joined Frederic Harrison and others and broke with Congreve to found a new positivist centre, Newton Hall, which in their affluence they supported generously. Vernon lectured there on the religion of humanity, science, and the arts; arranged musical programmes; led cultural pilgrimages; and wrote hymns, sonnets, and forty-nine entries for <span class="italic">The New Calendar of Great Men</span>, the positivists' biographical dictionary. He also had other verse printed privately.<br>
<br>Lushington had a happy family life. On 28 February 1865 he married Jane (1834&#150;1884), daughter of Francis Mowatt, a former MP. After her death he found consolation with their daughters, Katherine, Margaret, and Susan, all talented musicians. Kitty, who married Leopold Maxse, was the model for Mrs Dalloway in the novel by her friend Virginia Woolf; Susan, who remained single, was made an MBE for her work with amateur musicians. Lushington's London house was in Kensington Square, and his country residences were in Surrey, first at Pyrford, then at Cobham. He died of bronchitis at 36 Kensington Square on 24 January 1912 and was buried in Pyrford churchyard.<br>
