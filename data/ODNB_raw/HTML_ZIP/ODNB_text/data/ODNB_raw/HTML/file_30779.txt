<span class="headword">Powell,  Olave St Clair  Baden-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Olave St Clair Soames]</span>, Lady Baden-Powell  (1889&#150;1977), <span class="occ">leader of the world Girl Guide movement</span>, was born on 22 February 1889 at Stubbing Court, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the third child and younger daughter of Harold Soames (1855&#150;1918), and his wife, Katherine Mary Hill (1851&#150;1932). Her father, an educated and artistic man, had been able to sell his family business, the Brampton Brewery Company, in his early thirties, and thereafter was able to live comfortably off his investments. Her mother, a conventional, fashion-conscious woman, was her husband's opposite, and increasingly they lived separate lives. As her parents moved almost every year from one large rented property to the next, until settling at Grey Rigg, Lilliput, near Bournemouth, and as she received almost no formal education except through a German governess, Friede Dentzelmann, she had a lonely and emotionally confusing childhood. Not conventionally beautiful, and less favoured than her sister in her mother's affections, trust in her father was shattered by his affair with her first female role model, Jean Graham, who had been acting as her informal tutor. Spending much of her childhood in the country, she grew up an athletic and sporting young woman, na&iuml;ve in worldly matters and inexperienced emotionally, with little sense of personal direction. She was much influenced by Sybil Mounsey-Heysham, a Soames family friend, a woman of eccentric dress and masculine habits, reputed to be the third best duck shot in England. Throughout her life, Olave was attracted by vigorous, athletic, unaffected, independently minded women, with whom she would quarrel on occasion. In 1911 she was briefly engaged to her cousin Noel Soames.<br>
<br>In January 1912, while accompanying her father on a cruise on the SS <i>Arcadian</i>, she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30520/', "Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Baden-Powell (1857&#150;1941)")</script>, hero of the defence of Mafeking during the South African War and founder of the Boy Scout movement. Although he was thirty-two years her senior, they were immediately attracted to one another and had become secretly engaged by the end of the voyage. Despite Baden-Powell's briefly doubting the wisdom of his actions, a public engagement was announced, and the couple were married on 31 October 1912 at St Peter's Church, Parkstone, Dorset, to the disapproval of their surviving parents. Each brought complementary qualities to what became a happy, companionate marriage. For her husband, Olave brought a vigorous, unaffected, and youthful independence of spirit combined with an unquestioning belief in his individual genius and heroic status. For her, Baden-Powell was an ideal older man whom she could both support and defer to, and who gave a focus and purpose to her life for the first time. They had three children, Peter, Heather, and Betty.<br>
<br>Upon her marriage Olave gave herself totally and unquestioningly to the work of her husband and the two movements he had founded, the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides. She did voluntary work at the scout recreation hut at &Eacute;taples in France during the early part of the First World War. At the same time she built up her own position within the Girl Guides: moves that created tensions with her sister-in-law Agnes Baden-Powell, its first president. In early 1916 she assumed a leading role, first as county commissioner for Sussex (which she systematically reorganized along scout lines), then as chief commissioner for the United Kingdom from the end of that year, and finally as chief guide of the British empire from 1918. She also at times chaired the executive committee of the Girl Guides' Association in the absence of her husband. As a result she increasingly dominated the work of the association nationally in the period of its most rapid expansion, principally through her selection of women to take up the position of county commissioners across the country. Internationally she was also influential as head of the overseas department from January 1920. As with the earlier expansion of the Boy Scout movement between 1908 and 1910, the dramatic growth of the guide movement after 1916 created considerable personal tensions within the headquarters among the small and intimate band of strong-minded leading women at what one historian has called &#145;the Court of Queen Olave&#146;  (Jeal, 478). In disputes over policy, Olave was able to refer to the authority of her husband; on matters of personnel, he usually deferred to her intuitions.<br>
<br>From the late 1920s Olave Baden-Powell became less closely involved with the running of the UK association and spent more time supporting the international work of her husband, a role confirmed by her election as world chief guide in 1930, paralleling Baden-Powell's own position as chief scout of the world. She travelled extensively, initiated the guide and scout cruises, and ministered to the needs of her now elderly husband. In addition she had responsibility for an extended family, following the suicide of her sister Auriol early in 1919. Having settled at Pax Hill, Bentley, Hampshire, in January 1919, Olave ran a relaxed, rural household, supported by a loyal staff, ministering to her husband, five or six children, and a continuous stream of scout and guide guests. On the one hand, it was a happy unfussy, slightly eccentric community; on the other, Olave made some of the mistakes of her own mother, in clearly preferring her younger daughter, and showing a deep disappointment that her son could not live up to the heroic qualities of his father. Her dislike of sophistication and fashion, and the wholesomeness of the domestic environment, created difficulties in late adolescence for two of her children, and she was never reconciled to her son, Peter, whose funeral in 1962 she did not attend. On moving to Kenya in October 1938, the Baden-Powells settled at Paxtu, Nyeri, where Olave nursed and supported her husband until his death in January 1941.<br>
<br>As a widow of fifty-two, Olave had to rebuild her life. At first she was completely distraught, unable to attend his funeral. After initially engaging in voluntary work with the East Africa Women's League, she returned to the UK in September 1942, determined to devote the remainder of her life to sustaining her husband's work and reputation. This she did continuously and energetically until forced into semi-retirement by diabetes in 1970. In many ways this was her greatest achievement. As world chief guide, she had no defined authority in any national association or within the world organization. Nevertheless, her presence was always sought as an increasingly matriarchal figure for both movements, a role she fulfilled with charm, vigour, and charisma. Equally at ease with a small group of children or at a large adult international gathering, she was able to communicate the ideals of scouting and guiding and the unique vision (as she saw it) of her late husband in ways that remained in the minds of those present throughout their lives. Aided by a phenomenal memory for individuals, she maintained a vast ungrammatical and idiosyncratically typed correspondence from the grace-and-favour apartments she had accepted in Hampton Court Palace in December 1942. It is estimated that she travelled 488,000 miles between 1930 and 1977.<br>
<br>In personal terms Olave Baden-Powell had an almost completely untrained intelligence, which she combined with powerful intuitions, and an uncomplicated directness and eloquence, which had little patience with complexity or ambiguity. She had little time for discussions about details, policies, or bureaucratic structures. A lover of animals (but not cats), who delighted in the outdoor life and country dancing, and had a talent (if little used in later life) for the violin, she was not a reading woman. A conventional Anglican, although impatient&#151;like her husband&#151;of denominational detail, she nevertheless used mediums to communicate with the spirit of her husband after his death. In political terms, she shared some of the prejudices of her age and class as she grew older. But from the moment of their meeting in 1912, her values were those of her husband as expressed through scouting and guiding. Not surprisingly some of the changes introduced to update the scout movement in the 1960s were distressing to her, especially alterations in the wording of the scout laws and promise. As a result, she donated a considerable portion of her husband's archive and personal effects to the Boy Scouts of America, whom she thought more appreciative of his memory, and, possibly as a recognition of the fact that they had largely paid for her travel as world chief guide. In August 1973 she moved into a nursing home at Birtley House, near Guildford, Surrey, where she died on 25 June 1977. After her funeral at Bentley church on 1 July, her ashes were interred in her husband's grave at Nyeri, Kenya, in August. She had been created GBE in 1932 and received many other national honours around the world. There is a joint memorial tablet in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Although she always presented herself as simply the vehicle of her husband's vision, Olave Baden-Powell made her own distinctive contribution in two main ways. First, as a young woman of little formal education, she demonstrated to a whole generation of women (many of whom were unmarried) after 1918 that they could be constructive and effective as workers with girls and young women without having to subscribe to all the conventional constraints of Edwardian gentility in forms of dress and behaviour. Whatever the ambiguities of guiding's message for women (and it had many variants around the world), it remained a movement for girls and young women led by women of all social ranks and opinions. Although not uncontested, Olave Baden-Powell significantly aided that development as an enthusiast and role model. Second, in her later life, as an international ambassador on behalf of the ideals of her late husband after 1942, she supported and sustained the reputations of both movements as instruments of international harmony and reconciliation, so that despite the enormous cultural and political differences between national associations, almost all their members could affirm that what they had in common was more important than what distinguished them one from another.<br>
