<span class="headword">Oakeshott, Sir  Walter Fraser</span>  (1903&#150;1987), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and college head</span>, was born on 11 November 1903 in South Africa, the second of two sons among the four children of Walter Oakeshott, medical practitioner, of Lydenburg, Transvaal, and his wife, Kathleen Fraser. After Dr Oakeshott's early death his wife brought the family home to England. Walter went to Tonbridge School, Kent, where he became head boy, leaving with an exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1922. He achieved first classes in classical honour moderations (1924) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1926).<br>
<br>Oakeshott became an assistant master at Tooting Bec School, London, whence in 1927 he proceeded to Merchant Taylors' School. In 1931, after a year spent working for the Kent county education committee, he was appointed an assistant master at Winchester College, where he remained until 1938. Two events of his time there were important for him. The first was his discovery in 1934, among the manuscripts in the fellows' library, of the unique manuscript of <span class="italic">Morte d'Arthur</span> by Sir Thomas Malory. (His own full account of the find is given in <span class="italic">Essays on Malory</span>, edited by J. A. W. Bennett, 1963.) The second was the invitation to serve with the inquiry into unemployment sponsored by the Pilgrim Trust, for which he was given a year's leave of absence from the school (1936&#150;7). He took a major part in writing up the findings of the inquiry, in William Temple's <span class="italic">Men without Work</span> (1938).<br>
<br>In 1939 Oakeshott became high-master of St Paul's School, in London. On the outbreak of war he had to supervise the evacuation of the school to Crowthorne, Berkshire; the evacuation, and St Paul's adaptation to new surroundings and unfamiliar routines, were a triumph for his charismatic leadership. Soon after he had brought the school back to London in 1945 he was appointed headmaster of Winchester College, a post which he held from 1946 to 1954. Apart from one dire confrontation at the very end of his time, when his request to a housemaster to resign was challenged and upheld by only a majority on the governing body, this was a period of successful stewardship in a highly individual style. Although capable in administration he had no great taste for it, and where he shone was as a teacher and inspirer of the young, especially of those whom he stirred to share his own keen appreciation of artistic beauty. His personal rapport with boys of all ages and tastes left a very strong impression, fondly recalled by Wykehamists who were in the school during his time.<br>
<br>In 1954 Oakeshott was elected rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, where he presided for the next eighteen years. His was a period of remarkable expansion for the college, during which its tutorial fellowship more than doubled and its student accommodation greatly increased. In 1962&#150;4 he was vice-chancellor of Oxford, and during his term a commission of inquiry into Oxford University (1964&#150;6) was initiated, under the chairmanship of Lord Franks.<br>
<br>Both at Winchester and at Oxford, Oakeshott took a keen interest in buildings and restoration. At Winchester he was instrumental in the recovery of surviving panels of the college chapel's original medieval stained glass, dispersed in the nineteenth century, and their refitting in the windows of Thurbern's chantry. At Lincoln he was the moving spirit in the acquisition by the college of the redundant church of All Saints, for conversion into the college library. In Oxford he played a leading part in the restoration work made possible by the Oxford historic buildings appeal, in particular in the restoration of the stonework, sculptures, and interior of the Sheldonian Theatre.<br>
<br>Oakeshott dedicated the interstices of his busy life to scholarship, where his interests were many-sided. He wrote on Renaissance cosmography and early exploration (<span class="italic">Founded upon the Seas</span>, 1942, and several learned articles). His purchase and subsequent identification of a notebook belonging to Sir Walter Ralegh, written when he was collecting materials for <span class="italic">The History of the World</span> (1614), prompted research into the court culture of Elizabethan England and into Ralegh's poetry (<span class="italic">The Queen and the Poet</span>, 1962). His most abiding interest was in medieval art history, and his two studies of the Winchester <span class="roman">Bible</span> (<span class="italic">The Artists of the Winchester Bible</span>, 1945, and <span class="italic">The Two Winchester Bibles</span>, 1981) were authoritative and influential, especially the former, a pioneering work identifying the hands and styles of the painters who worked on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the influences which shaped their work. Among his other books were <span class="italic">Mosaics of Rome</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">Sigena Wall Paintings</span> (1972).<br>
<br>Oakeshott held honorary doctorates of the universities of St Andrews and East Anglia, and was an honorary fellow of both Balliol (1974) and Lincoln (1972). He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1971 and was knighted in 1980. He was master of the Skinners' Company (1960&#150;61), a long-serving trustee of the Pilgrim Trust, and president of the Bibliographical Society (1966&#150;8).<br>
<br>Oakeshott was a tall man, of gracious bearing, with a high forehead, eyebrows which fluttered in animation, and a characteristically beaming smile. His manner was gentle and courteous; he had an instinctive personal modesty, a delightfully whimsical wit, and a gift for friendship. In teaching, research, and life he strove continually for what he believed could inspire and elevate. He married in 1928 No&euml;l Rose, daughter of Robert Oswald Moon, consultant physician. They had twin sons and two daughters, and the family was a close and affectionate one. His wife predeceased him in 1976, and he was buried beside her after he died, on 13 October 1987, at his home, the Old School House, Eynsham, Oxfordshire.<br>
