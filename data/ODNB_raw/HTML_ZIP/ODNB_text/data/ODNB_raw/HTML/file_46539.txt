<span class="headword">Skeffington,  Francis  Sheehy-</span>  (1878&#150;1916), <span class="occ">women's rights activist and pacifist</span>, was born on 23 December 1878 in Bailieborough, co. Cavan, and christened Francis Joseph Christopher Skeffington, the only child of Joseph Bartholomew (J. B.) Skeffington (1847&#150;1919), scholar and teacher, and his wife, Rose Magorian (1829&#150;1909), daughter of a farmer in the co. Down village of Ballykinlar. His parents were married in the Roman Catholic chapel in Ballykinlar on 30 September 1869 when his father was twenty-two and his mother forty. Francis Skeffington grew up in Downpatrick, co. Down, where his father, as an official in the national education system, was a district supervisor of education. J. B. Skeffington was opinionated, arrogant, tyrannical, and punctilious. He was also extremely honest, had a great respect for ideas, and a strong sense of order, virtue, morality, and kindliness toward others: these latter qualities his son inherited.<br>
<br>The dominant culture in Downpatrick was protestant, pro-British, anti-Catholic. The Skeffingtons&#151;being devout Catholics&#151;lived in an all-Catholic ghetto. Francis learned early to reject the bigotry of the protestants while, at the same time, viewing with some clarity and scepticism the errors of his own group. Until he entered university, Francis's only teacher was his father. He was well taught and when he entered University College, Dublin, in 1896, his major lifelong goals were fixed. He wanted to improve the world, crusade for political and economic freedom for women, and free Ireland from British rule. In 1909 he joined the Socialist Party, convinced that socialism was the only remedy for the evils of society. Also fixed was his attire: rough, grey tweed suit and knickerbockers, with long stockings&#151;in imitation of George Bernard Shaw. Known to his fellow students as Frank, Skeff, or Skeffy, he was slightly over 5 feet 5 inches, deceptively frail appearing, with a soft, fair, badly trimmed beard. His voice was somewhat high-pitched, his accent that of an Ulsterman. He had a brisk handshake and the humourless habit of concentrating on points made casually. At the university, his closest companions were the writer James Joyce (with whom, in 1901, he privately printed <span class="italic">Two Essays</span>) and Thomas Kettle, who would become known as politician, essayist, and poet. Francis is portrayed as McCann in Joyce's <span class="italic">Stephen Hero</span>, and Joyce draws him as well in <span class="italic">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1903 Francis Skeffington and Hanna Sheehy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38533/', "Skeffington, Johanna Mary Sheehy-")</script>], scholar and teacher and the daughter of David Sheehy, a mill owner and nationalist MP, were married. In order to demonstrate their belief in equality for women, he and Hanna took each other's surname. He thus became Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. Their only child was the politician and university teacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54751/', "Owen Lancelot Sheehy-Skeffington")</script>. That year also he was appointed the first lay registrar at University College, Dublin. The Women Graduates Association was fighting then for admission of women to the university on an equal basis with men and Francis helped to write and circulate their petitions. Since as an officer of the college he had no right to advocate opposition policy, he was asked to resign.<br>
<br>In 1908 the Irish Women's Franchise League (IWFL), militant wing of the Irish suffrage movement, was formed in the Sheehy-Skeffingtons' home. Men were accepted as associate members and Francis promptly joined. The IWFL was attacked by the Irish press for its insistence that any home rule bill must include a plank for women's suffrage, and Francis felt that only a rival paper would serve to counteract the attacks. The first edition of his new paper, the <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span>, appeared on 25 May 1912. It proved to be his most ambitious venture and also the longest lasting, most time-consuming, and most rewarding. Its lead editorial stated its aim: &#145;to win for men and women equally the rights of citizenship and to claim from men and women equally the duties of citizenship&#146;.<br>
<br>When the United Kingdom declared war in August 1914, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington defined war in the <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span> of 22 August 1914 as &#145;one of the social evils, like drink and prostitution that arise from neglect of the feminine point of view and based on a theory of society one-sidedly and arrogantly male&#146;, and on 15 August an <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span> poster read &#145;Votes for Women Now! Damn Your War!&#146;<br>
<br>Every Sunday at Beresford Place in Dublin, Sheehy-Skeffington spoke out against the war and urged Irishmen not to enlist to &#145;fight England's battles for naval supremacy&#146;, nor to become part of the English garrison in Ireland. After forty such speeches, he was arrested on 29 May 1915, sent to Mountjoy prison, and sentenced to six months' hard labour and an additional six months in default of bail. When, on 9 June, sentence was imposed, Francis stood and said: &#145;I will eat no food from this moment, and long before the expiration of the sentence I shall be out of prison alive or dead&#146;  (Sheehy-Skeffington, <span class="italic">Speech from the Dock</span>, 11). For seven days he was on hunger strike, and then released because of his health, under the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span>. He was using a strategy common to women suffragists in both Britain and Ireland: in 1912 two British women, Mary Leigh and Gladys Evans, who had been demonstrating in Ireland, had received a sentence of five years' penal servitude. They had gone on hunger strike and had been forcibly fed. Four Irish women, among them Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, who were then serving a month's sentence for vandalizing government property, went on hunger strike for one week to protest against the severity of the British women's sentence. And in 1913 in Dublin, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, who had been sentenced to seven days in the Mountjoy prison for assaulting a police officer, went on hunger strike and was released after five days because of her physical condition.<br>
<br>The nationalist James Connolly and Sheehy-Skeffington had become fast friends: their goals for socialism, feminism, and against the war were identical. But Sheehy-Skeffington was absolutely opposed to an armed uprising and never varied in his opinion. &#145;I would rather be shot than shoot anyone&#146;  (Byrne, 122) he told his friend Byrne, and he spoke out at every opportunity for peace and pacifism.<br>
<br>On Tuesday 25 April 1916, the second day of the Easter rising led by Connolly, Sheehy-Skeffington, after witnessing considerable looting on the previous day, tried to recruit volunteers to stop the looting. That evening, walking home over the Portobello Bridge and with bystanders calling out to him by name, he was placed under arrest and taken to nearby Portobello barracks. Reason given: it seemed advisable to arrest pedestrians who were attracting attention in order to avoid altercations. He was detained that night and the next morning, shortly before ten, was taken from his cell by Captain J. C. Bowen-Colthurst of the Royal Irish Rifles. With two other prisoners, Sheehy-Skeffington was taken into the barracks yard and summarily executed. It was Wednesday morning, 26 April 1916.<br>
<br>Every attempt was made to cover up the executions and the events surrounding them. Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington received no notification of her husband's death and was refused any information by the military. Not until Friday, two days later, did she learn the facts. After repeated requests on her part for a public inquiry, a court martial&#151;with attendance by invitation only&#151;was held in Richmond barracks, Dublin, on 6 and 7 June 1916. The court found Captain Bowen-Colthurst guilty but insane at the time of the murders. He was sentenced to detention in an asylum for the criminally insane at Broadmoor in England, the length of time to be at his majesty's discretion. After twenty months he was released and emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia. Still dissatisfied, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington pressed for an open inquiry, and on 17 August 1916 a royal commission was convened and a report covering every aspect of the case issued on 29 September. Late in 1916 Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington published her husband's novel, <span class="italic">In Dark and Evil Days</span>, with a biographical memoir.<br>
<br>On 8 May 1916 Francis Sheehy-Skeffington's body, which had been buried in the mortuary at Portobello barracks, was exhumed and reburied in Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin. This man who had implored Irishmen not to fight England's battles had met his death at the hands of an Irish recruit to the British army, and this man who believed that all problems could be settled without violence had met his death as the victim of violence.<br>
