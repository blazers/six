<span class="headword">Douglas,  James</span>, second marquess of Douglas  (<em>c.</em>1646&#150;1700), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the only son of Archibald Douglas, earl of Angus (<i>c</i>.1609&#150;1655), and his first wife, Lady Anna (<i>bap</i>. 1614, <i>d</i>. 1646), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67529/', "Esm&#233; Stuart, third duke of Lennox (1579?&#150;1624)")</script>, and his wife, Katherine Clifton. Following the death of his father in 1655 he bore the courtesy title of earl of Angus, and he was still under age in 1660 when he succeeded his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7934/', "William Douglas, first marquess of Douglas")</script>, as second marquess. On his father's request he had been placed in the care of his paternal aunt, Margaret, Lady Alexander, but she died at about the same time as her father. The family estates at Douglas's entry were in such an embarrassed condition, mainly because of accumulated debts, that it was estimated that his clear disposable income amounted to just &pound;1000 Scots yearly. On 8 September 1668, after the attainment of his majority, he was served heir to his father in the earldom of Angus. In 1670, by a contract dated 7 September, he married Lady Barbara Erskine, eldest daughter of John Erskine, earl of Mar. Douglas Castle, which had fallen into disrepair, was renovated for their use. The marriage was not a happy one: the marchioness complained that her husband treated her with contempt, while he accused her of not affording him the respect he was due. A contract of separation, agreed in 1681, was made the subject of a popular ballad entitled &#145;Lord James Douglas&#146; or &#145;The Marchioness of Douglas&#146;, beginning &#145;O Waly, waly up the bank&#146;  (C. Mackay, <span class="italic">The Legendary and Romantic Ballads of Scotland</span>, 1861, 189&#150;94). The marchioness, with whom he had one son, died about August 1690.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16194/', "William Lawrie")</script>, tutor of Blackwood, the marquess's trusted factor and chamberlain, who was blamed by many for the estrangement, had since his appointment in 1670 exacerbated rather than improved Douglas's financial state. A royal commission of investigation into the marquess's affairs, initiated in 1684 by Charles II, came to nothing. When, following the battle of Bothwell Bridge, Blackwood was condemned to be beheaded, Douglas begged successfully for his life, asserting that Blackwood was the only man who knew his affairs. In 1692 the marquess married, by contract dated 13 December, his second wife, Lady Mary Kerr (<i>bap</i>. 1674, <i>d</i>. 1736), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15465/', "Robert Kerr, first marquess of Lothian")</script>. They had two sons and one daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7905/', "Lady Jane Douglas")</script>. Mary refused to allow Blackwood's interference in domestic affairs and after acquainting herself with the financial condition of the estate accused him of gross mismanagement. With the help of her father she managed to secure the appointment of a commission to take charge of the estate in 1698. It found debts in excess of &pound;240,000 Scots. The commissioners dismissed Blackwood, but it was to be a few months before the marquess's view of him was changed.<br>
<br>Douglas was frequently present in parliament, and after his admission to the privy council in 1671 he regularly attended its meetings, but he was not at the forefront of politics during the reigns of Charles II and James VII. In the spring of 1689, however, he was a member of the committee of estates that ushered in the revolution, and in May was named as one of William III's council. About 1690 the new king granted him the forfeited estates of John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, and he was also appointed to the heritable office of constable of the castle and town of Dundee. He died at Douglas on 25 February 1700 and was buried in the old chapel of St Bride on 1 March.<br>
