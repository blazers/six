<span class="headword">Cokkys,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1475), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, is one of the few men whose name can be linked to the teaching and practice of medicine at Oxford in the fifteenth century. It is all the more frustrating that so few facts about his life can be established with any certainty. Emden lists a number of benefices held by a John Cokkys from 1435 onwards, but it seems unlikely that a man who was granted licence to study at an English university for three years on 21 January 1448, and was admitted BCnL at Oxford in June 1449, should already have held three benefices. His most significant qualification was the degree of bachelor of medicine to which he was admitted on 30 June 1450, and which seems to have given him entry to medical practice and teaching in Oxford for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Three medical manuscripts in which his name appears testify to his medical learning and teaching, and one of these, Bodl. Oxf., MS e Museo 155, a collection of Roger Bacon's writings, is in the hand of Cokkys. He seems to have had the knack of getting his name attached to other people's writings. Thus he is credited (as Johannes de Gallicantu) with a commentary on the <span class="italic">Isagoge</span> of Johannitius, the fundamental introduction to medicine at Oxford, which in fact is the work of a thirteenth-century commentator known as Johannes Anglicus. A sentence in Cambridge, King's College, MS 16, part 2, folio 7, has led to the attribution of another text to him&#151;first by Simon Forman, the owner of this manuscript from 1574&#151;but in fact this text is the commentary of Bernardus Provincialis on the <span class="italic">Tabula Salerni</span>. While Cokkys seems to be claiming in this sentence that he is revealing the secrets of his practice to his pupils, his name has been interpolated into a commentary on medicinal simples. What these manuscripts do bear out is that Cokkys did teach medicine in Oxford, using the standard elementary texts and commentaries of the day as lecture materials. The Oxford medical curriculum seems in most respects to have been deeply conservative, though the interest in alchemical matters, and in Roger Bacon's work, taken by Cokkys was one also shared by another prominent Oxford doctor, Gilbert Kymer.<br>
<br>Cokkys also practised medicine, as is revealed in a chancery writ  (TNA: PRO, early chanc. proc., C 1/45/175), dated 1467/73, in which he was summoned to answer for having withheld evidence relating to the death of John Walweyn, who had been his patient. John Clerk, mayor of Oxford, and the surgeon John Barbour were also co-defendants. A number of recipes given to Cokkys are quoted in Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1432: a drink for the stone &#145;proved uppon hymselff&#146;, another for dropsy, others for palsy, bad sight, &#145;fleuma&#146;, and various aches. These are typical practical remedies of the sort found in commonplace and recipe books of this period. Cokkys appears to have remained in Oxford for the rest of his life. He was a benefactor of Canterbury College, as recognized by letters of confraternity from Christ Church Cathedral priory, Canterbury, on 5 May 1463. Emden, who identifies Cokkys with the rector of Mixbury, Witney, and Hardwick, parishes in Oxfordshire, estimates that he was dead by April 1475.<br>
