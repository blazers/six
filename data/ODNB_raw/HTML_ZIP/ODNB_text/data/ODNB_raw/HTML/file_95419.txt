<span class="headword">Battye,  Aubyn Bernard Rochfort  Trevor-</span>  (1855&#150;1922), <span class="occ">traveller and naturalist</span>, was born at Hever, Kent, on 17 July 1855, the second son in the family of two sons and three daughters of William Wilberforce Battye (1822&#150;1890), rector of Hever, and his wife, Harriet Dorothea (1827&#150;1904), daughter of Edmund Wakefield Meade-Waldo of Stonewall Park and Hever Castle. His father was a descendant of Sir John Trevor (<i>bap</i>. 1624, <i>d</i>. 1672), and in 1883 succeeded to Trevor estates at Tingrith (Bedfordshire) and Little Hampden (Buckinghamshire); on his death in 1890 his widow and children assumed the name of Trevor-Battye.<br>
<br>Trevor-Battye was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford (1871&#150;3), and then engaged in stints as a private tutor while maintaining a busy sporting and social life. He returned to St Edward's in 1881 as assistant master in order to prepare for entry to Oxford University and matriculated there as a non-collegiate student in 1882. Migrating to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1884, he graduated with a BA pass degree in 1887, having studied under the naturalist H. N. Moseley. During the next six years he travelled widely, pursuing his amateur interests in ornithology, fishing, and hunting big game. He also wrote short stories, republished as <span class="italic">Pictures in Prose of Nature, Wild Sport, and Humble Life</span> (1894). He was a member of the British Ornithologists' Union, and a fellow of the Linnean and Zoological societies.<br>
<br>Encouraged by the naturalist and polar explorer Henry Wemyss Feilden (1838&#150;1921), Trevor-Battye undertook a private expedition to Kolguyev Island in northern Russia. He travelled to Archangel to make preliminary enquiries in 1893, and returned in the following year on the steam yacht <i>Saxon</i>, chartered by his friend Mervyn Powys for a hunting expedition in the islands of the Barents Sea. They reached Kolguyev in June 1894. Along with his assistant Thomas Hyland (whose duties included preserving the bird specimens collected by the expedition) and his spaniel, Trevor-Battye was left with supplies and an agreement to be collected by the vessel after one month. An extensive study of the flora and fauna of the island was made, with special attention to its breeding birds, and the island was partly mapped. Unfortunately the <i>Saxon</i> suffered a breakdown and it was impossible to keep the return appointment. When Powys eventually reached Kolguyev, ice prevented a landing. Believing that Trevor-Battye's party had already left by other means, the vessel continued to Scotland. The explorers were therefore marooned on the island. Friendly contact with Samoyed (Nenets) reindeer herders enabled them to leave in September. They then had a 1000 mile journey across northern Russia to Archangel in the season of <i>rasputnya</i>, when travel was normally deemed impossible. Their arduous and sometimes dangerous journey took them almost five weeks.<br>
<br>In the meantime friends had become anxious that Trevor-Battye had not returned. The Foreign Office and the Royal Geographical Society became involved, and a rescue expedition was planned by his brother, Charles Edmund Augustine Trevor Trevor-Battye (1853&#150;1931) (at that time known as Trevor Battye-Trevor). In November 1894 telegrams arrived from Archangel announcing their arrival, followed by summaries of their adventures. Trevor-Battye wrote <span class="italic">Ice-Bound on Kolguev</span> (1895), describing the investigations on the island, and <span class="italic">A Northern Highway of the Tsar</span> (1898), recounting their difficult return. These remain among the few English-language sources for Kolguyev.<br>
<br>Trevor-Battye was invited to join Sir Martin Conway's expedition to Spitsbergen in 1896, as zoologist. Although he made contributions, and took part in a partial ascent of the Hornsundtind, relations between him and Conway became strained. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in November 1896. He joined the <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> project in 1899 as honorary secretary to the council and editor for natural history, but had little involvement after 1902. On 1 May 1901 he married Margaret Amy, daughter of C. North Graham. They made their home at Chilbolton, Hampshire, and had two daughters. He now travelled less, devoting time to writing and to editing some memoirs of his friend the ornithologist Lord Lilford (1903). His wife developed tuberculosis in 1905 and died in Switzerland in 1906.<br>
<br>Trevor-Battye attended the British Association meeting in South Africa in 1905 as a committee member of the geographical section, and went on to the Victoria Falls with a view to studying the natural history of the upper Zambezi, but returned to England on receiving news of his wife's illness. In 1906 he visited zoos in Europe and gave a paper to the Zoological Society that resulted in improvements to the zoological gardens in Regent's Park, London. He explored Crete in 1908 and 1909, describing his travels in <span class="italic">Camping in Crete</span> (1913), including ornithological and topographical data. He visited South Africa again in 1910, and in 1914 he travelled to India with his friend Henry John Elwes. Trevor-Battye had known the viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, when they were young and this helped him to get permission to visit Sikkim. Elwes had been invited to visit Nepal, so the two of them were able to watch and photograph a <i>keddah</i> (capture of wild elephants) and travel to Katmandu at a time when Europeans were seldom admitted. After the First World War Trevor-Battye continued to write and to attend meetings of the Royal Geographical Society, but his health was deteriorating. Resident for the last decade of his life at Ashford Chace, Hampshire, he was advised to go abroad, and died at the Queen Victoria Hospital, Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands, on 19 or 20 December 1922.<br>
<br>Though never wealthy, Trevor-Battye had sufficient means to travel widely in pursuit of a range of interests. He made friends readily, but was firm when faced with difficulties. His writings included five books, a contribution to another, and over twenty papers in ornithological or geographical journals.<br>
