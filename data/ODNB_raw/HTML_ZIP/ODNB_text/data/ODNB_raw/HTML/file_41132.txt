<span class="headword">Fisher <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ilbert]</span>,  Lettice</span>  (1875&#150;1956), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born on 14 June 1875 at 19 Southwick Street, Kensington, London, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34090/', "Sir Courtenay Peregrine Ilbert (1841&#150;1924)")</script>, clerk of the House of Commons, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradley (<i>d</i>. 1923/4). After attending Francis Holland School, London, she went up to Oxford in 1894 to read modern history at Somerville College, taking a first in 1897. During 1897&#150;8 she held research studentships at the London School of Economics. On 6 July 1899 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33141/', "Herbert Albert Laurens Fisher (1865&#150;1940)")</script>, a tutor at New College, Oxford, who had taught her as an undergraduate. They had one daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96141/', "Mary Bennett (1913&#150;2005)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33141/', "Fisher, Herbert Albert Laurens")</script>], who later became principal of St Hilda's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>From 1902 to 1913 Lettice Fisher was modern history tutor at St Hugh's College, Oxford, one of the first generation of tutors appointed by the women's colleges, and she also taught economics for the Association for the Higher Education of Women in Oxford. During this period she began undertaking voluntary social work. She was one of the founders, in 1902, of the Oxford Sanitary Aid Association, which sought to improve housing and sanitary conditions in the city. From this developed the Infant Welfare Association, which attempted to educate working-class mothers in child-rearing through health visiting, lectures, film shows, and babies' welfare clubs, and by establishing clinics. She also served on the executive of the Oxford Health and Housing Association, founded in 1912 in recognition of the close link between living conditions and infant welfare. She was active in the constitutional movement for women's suffrage through her membership of the Oxford Students' Suffrage Society and the Oxford branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), and was among the university women whom Millicent Fawcett co-opted onto the national executive of the NUWSS (Lettice Fisher chaired the executive from 1916 to 1918).<br>
<br>Lettice Fisher left Oxford in 1913, after her husband was made vice-chancellor of Sheffield University. Through her gift for entertaining and befriending students, she played an important part in establishing a sense of collegiality between teacher and student as existed at Oxford. During the First World War she undertook welfare work among women munitions workers in Sheffield. It was the wartime scale of illegitimacy and its resulting hardships that led her in 1918 to found the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child. This &#145;abiding and deep interest of all her later life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Feb 1956, 11) was sparked by the registrar-general's report of 1916 which showed that the ratio of illegitimate to legitimate mortality in the first week of life had increased from 170 per cent in 1907 to 201 per cent in 1916. This evidence spurred the child welfare council of the Social Welfare Association of London to establish a child welfare office. With the welfare office overwhelmed with work, a special committee was set up to investigate further the problem of unmarried mothers. Out of this investigation arose the national council with Fisher as its first chair, a post she held until 1949.<br>
<br>The aims of the council were both political and practical, but its true purpose was the re-education of public opinion, which viewed any help for unmarried mothers as &#145;a challenge to the accepted standards of morality&#146; and believed that the best solution to the problem was the adoption of a deterrent rather than constructive policy  (Fisher, 6). While eschewing the language of blame and punishment, the council did not shy away from putting its case for supporting unmarried mothers in moral terms. Though it argued that the separation of any mother from her baby was a factor in the high mortality of illegitimate children and should therefore be regarded as an exceptional measure, it believed that by keeping the child with her it would be possible to reform the mother for its sake and to improve her moral standards. The council also set out to awaken in fathers a sense of responsibility particularly in regard to maintenance.<br>
<br>Under Lettice Fisher's leadership many of the aims of the council were fulfilled. Thousands of women were helped and the council played an active part in shaping legislation on such matters as the subsequent legitimization of children born before their parents' marriage, adoption, and the collection of maintenance from fathers. Grants for the work were not always easy to come by, so Fisher supported the council by organizing every year a fund-raising event in Oxford as well as by lobbying friends.<br>
<br>During the first decades of universal suffrage, in the 1920s and 1930s, Lettice Fisher was a prolific writer in the cause of equipping all voters, but particularly women, to function as responsible and informed citizens. She wrote many books for both children and adults on economics and history. The didactic nature of much of her work is evident in <span class="italic">Then and Now</span> (1925), in which she uses the past to illuminate the present, drawing parallels between the economic and social upheavals following the Napoleonic wars and the choices faced by governments after 1918. <span class="italic">The housewife and the townhall: a brief description of what is done by our local councils and public services</span> (1934), which she produced in consultation with the National Federation of Women's Institutes, grew out of a series of radio broadcasts aimed at women wanting to learn more about government; she urged them to participate actively as voters or representatives.<br>
<br>In 1940, on the death of her husband, who had been warden of New College, Oxford, since 1925, Lettice Fisher settled at Rock Cottage, Thursley, Surrey, formerly their country residence. She died there on 14 February 1956 after suffering a stroke. After cremation her ashes were interred at New College, Oxford.<br>
