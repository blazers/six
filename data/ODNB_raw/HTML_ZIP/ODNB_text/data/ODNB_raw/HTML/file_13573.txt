<span class="headword">Holloway, Sir  Charles</span>  (1749&#150;1827), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 17 April 1749; nothing is known of his parents. On 7 February 1764 he entered the drawing room of the Board of Ordnance at the Tower of London and in 1773 he went to Portsmouth to assist the commanding royal engineer with the plans of the new fortifications. There, on 17 January 1776, he was commissioned second lieutenant of engineers, and in 1777 he was sent to Gibraltar. When the great siege began in 1779, the chief engineer, Colonel (later Sir) William Green (1725&#150;1811), appointed Holloway his staff officer, and on Green's promotion to brigadier in 1781, his brigade major. Holloway's diaries, of which there is a partial transcript among the Conolly papers at Chatham, describe the siege and his role in it. Having been promoted first lieutenant on 1 January 1783, he was wounded by a shell splinter three days later, and in June, after Gibraltar's defence had been successfully concluded, he was publicly thanked by the governor, General Sir George Augustus Eliott.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1784 Holloway joined Major-General William Roy and for three years assisted him in his survey triangulations in Kent. He married, on 15 December 1785, Helen Mary (<i>d</i>. 11 April 1798), daughter of his former commanding officer General Sir William Green; they had six children. From 1788 onwards Holloway superintended fortification work at Landguard and Yarmouth, Gravesend and Tilbury, and Woolwich. On 16 January 1793 he was promoted captain-lieutenant and, after succeeding as commanding engineer Thames division, was promoted captain on 31 December 1795. His company of artificers was roughly handled when a riot broke out among the artillerymen at Woolwich in May 1797.<br>
<br>In October 1798 Holloway was chosen as second in command, with the local rank of major, of a military mission under Brigadier-General G. F. Koehler to assist the Turks in repelling the French invasion of Egypt. After arriving at Constantinople in March 1799, Holloway was sent to report on the Dardanelles fortifications. In June 1800 he went with the mission to Jaffa in Syria where the Ottoman army was regrouping after being repulsed from Egypt. News of the arrival in the eastern Mediterranean of a British army under General Sir Ralph Abercromby&#151;coincidental with the death from plague of General Koehler on 29 December 1800&#151;meant that the urgent task of ensuring that the Turks returned to Egypt in support of Abercromby's expedition now fell to Holloway. Despite the ravages of the plague, the lack of supplies, and the chronic indiscipline of the Ottoman army, Holloway spurred his hosts forward, and in March 1801, organized in three divisions as he had suggested, the army began its slow advance from Gaza across the desert. On 16 May the Turks encountered the French under General Belliard at al-Khanka, outside Cairo. Holloway, knowing the British army on the Nile was approaching, had wished the Turks to avoid combat, but the French were unable to defeat the masses of horsemen swirling about them and after seven hours they withdrew. The surrender of the French in Egypt, first in Cairo and then Alexandria, followed within months.<br>
<br>Although in his dispatches Holloway, who on 1 January 1801 was promoted major with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel, modestly played down his own contribution, the ambassador in Constantinople, Lord Elgin, informed the government that the successful advance of the Turks, and their victory at al-Khanka, were due to Holloway's influence. On his return to England Holloway received a knighthood (2 February 1803) to add to the five pelisses of honour and a gold medal already awarded him by the Turks.<br>
<br>In March 1803 Holloway was appointed commanding royal engineer (CRE) at Cork where, to secure the defences of the harbour, he constructed a large new fort on Spike Island. On 20 July 1804 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and a year later was one of a committee of military engineers appointed to recommend a system of defence for Ireland. He returned to Gibraltar as CRE in 1807. He reported on the defences of Cadiz, Algeciras, and Ceuta in 1809, and in 1810, with Spanish agreement, he demolished by mines the old forts and lines to the north of the neutral ground of the Gibraltar isthmus to prevent their use by the French. In October 1813 one of the recurrent outbreaks of fever at Gibraltar killed Holloway's son Charles, an artillery lieutenant, and a daughter, Helen Smith, wife of an officer in the garrison. Holloway was promoted colonel on 1 May 1811 and major-general on 4 June 1814, and in September 1817 he left Gibraltar for England. He retired by sale of his commission on 17 July 1824 and died at his home at Stoke Cottage, Stoke Damerel, Devonport, Devon, on 4 January 1827. His will instructed that he be buried near his daughter Augusta Jane in Exeter Cathedral.<br>
<br>Holloway's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_8755"></a><span class="headword">William Cuthbert  Elphinstone-Holloway</span>  (1787&#150;1850), was born on 1 May 1787 and, after attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, joined the Royal Engineers as a <span class="occ">second lieutenant</span> on 1 January 1804. He served with his father at Cork before spending the year of 1808 with the British garrison on Madeira. In 1810, having been employed in the eastern military district in England, he left for the Peninsular War. His conduct as a second captain at the capture of Badajoz, during which he was severely wounded, was mentioned in Wellington's dispatch of 27 March 1812  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 1812, 702). He was awarded a wound pension, and after further duties in Britain he was posted to the Cape of Good Hope in 1818, served in the Cape Frontier War of 1819, and conducted military surveys before returning home in 1831. He took from his wife, Amelia (<i>d</i>. 12 July 1874), daughter of Captain Thomas Elphinstone RN, the additional surname of Elphinstone in February 1825. He was made a companion of the Bath on 26 September 1831. His subsequent duties in Ireland were followed by promotion to colonel on 23 November 1841 and an appointment as CRE in Canada between 1843 and 1849. He died as CRE western district at Plymouth Citadel, Devon, on 4 September 1850, and was buried in Plymouth cemetery.<br>
