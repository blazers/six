<span class="headword">O'Keeffe,  Adelaide</span>  (1776&#150;1865), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born at Eustace Street, Dublin, on 5 November 1776, the only daughter and third child of Irish parents, the dramatist and actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20658/', "John O'Keeffe (1747&#150;1833)")</script> and Mary Heaphy (1757&#150;1813), actress. Her younger brother Gerald died in infancy. Her childhood was traumatic: her parents had a troubled marriage and her mother was often absent. Adelaide was put out to a nurse until she was five. After the marriage ended her mother was denied access to the children by Adelaide's father. In 1781 John O'Keeffe moved to London as an operatic composer and playwright for the Haymarket, Covent Garden, and Drury Lane theatres. Adelaide and her elder brother John Tottenham followed in 1782 to attend school in London but were shortly afterwards sent to France to avoid what were considered by John O'Keeffe to be the unwanted attentions of his wife. While her brother John enjoyed a &#145;superior and expensive education&#146; in Paris, at Westminster School, and Exeter College, Oxford  (O'Keeffe, xviii), Adelaide suffered the &#145;horror&#146; of convent schooling until 1788 and subsequently assisted her then blind father in his compositions. She cared for her father until he died.<br>
<br>Adelaide O'Keeffe embarked on her own career in the early 1790s with the composition of a novel, <span class="italic">Llewellin</span> (1799), a fictionalization of the life of Piers Gaveston's son as narrated to Chaucer. In 1798 she wrote <span class="italic">Patriarchal Times, or, The Land of Canaan</span>, a fictional reworking of chapters from <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, but she was unable to find a publisher for it until 1811. It proved to be critically and commercially successful. But it was her poems published in Ann and Jane Taylor's <span class="italic">Original Poems for Infant Minds</span> (1804) which established her reputation and remain, to the detriment of her novels, her best-known work. Following this success, she continued to write verses for children which were witty and cautionary in equal measure, publishing <span class="italic">Original Poems Calculated to Improve the Mind of Youth</span> (1808), <span class="italic">National Characters Exhibited in 40 Geographical Poems</span> (1808), and <span class="italic">Poems for Young Children</span> (1849). She also continued to write novels: <span class="italic">Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra</span> (1814), the three-volume epistolary <span class="italic">Dudley</span> (1819), and <span class="italic">The Broken Sword: a Tale</span> (1854), a story of parental separation.<br>
<br>After her father gave up the stage in 1798, it seems that O'Keeffe was financially responsible for the household despite her modest income (she later called for authors to be rewarded by annual grants, and wrote to the publishers Harvey and Darton concerning her underpayment for her contributions to <span class="italic">Original Poems</span>: see <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 7th ser., 3.361&#150;2). O'Keeffe lived with her father in London and then moved with him in 1815 to Chichester, where she worked as a governess; in 1830 they moved to Southampton where John O'Keeffe died. Devoted to her father from early childhood, she published a tribute to him in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span> (1833) and a memoir in <span class="italic">O'Keeffe's Legacy to his Daughter</span> (1834). Following his death, she made numerous successful applications for grants of financial assistance from the Royal Literary Fund between 1834 and 1865. Her last known work was <span class="italic">The Broken Sword, or, A Soldier's Honour</span>, with an introduction by the author dated Southampton, January 1854. She died, unmarried, at Brighton, Sussex, on 4 September 1865.<br>
