<span class="headword">Ragnvald</span> <span class="st"> [R&ouml;gnvaldr, Reginald, Ragnall]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1229), <span class="occ">king of Man and the Isles</span>, was the oldest but illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50615/', "Godred")</script>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50614/', "&#211;l&#225;f")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50613/', "Godred Crovan")</script>]. Although his father had wished to be succeeded by his legitimate son &Oacute;l&aacute;f, in 1187 the Manxmen brought Ragnvald from the Western Isles to be their king, &#145;since he was a sturdy man and of maturer years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cronica regum Mannie et Insularum</span>, fol. 40<i>v</i>). He is said to have founded St Mary's Priory of Cistercian nuns at Douglas  (Cowan and Easson, 238). The Irish author of a Gaelic poem in his honour describes him as the son of Sadb, possibly an Irishwoman, makes some exaggerated statements of his claim to the high-kingship of Ireland, and seeks patronage when Ragnvald establishes a footing in Dublin. His unnamed daughter married Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd, who in 1193 subdued Anglesey with Ragnvald's help; after Rhodri's death Ragnvald sought unsuccessfully to secure her marriage to Rhodri's nephew, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth. It was perhaps in 1198 that William the Lion, king of Scots, granted him the earldom of Caithness for an annual rent, which Ragnvald, described in one source as &#145;the greatest warrior in the western lands&#146;, subdued with an army drawn from the Hebrides, Kintyre, and Ireland  (<span class="italic">Flateyjarb&oacute;k</span>, 2.515&#150;17).<br>
<br>In 1204, when John de Courcy, married to Ragnvald's sister, Affreca, was forced from power in Ulster by Hugh de Lacy, he took refuge with Ragnvald in Man, but together they failed in an attempt to recover Ulster in the following year. In February 1205 Ragnvald was given letters of protection by King John, and was in England later that year when he was granted lands in Lancashire &#145;for his homage and service&#146;  (Oliver, 2.27). About 1208 Ragnvald captured his brother &Oacute;l&aacute;f, who had ruled Lewis under him, and handed him over to William the Lion, in whose prison he remained until the latter's death in 1214. Ragnvald subsequently prevailed on &Oacute;l&aacute;f to marry &#145;the daughter of a certain nobleman of Kintyre, the sister of his own wife&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cronica regum Mannie et Insularum</span>, fol. 42<i>r</i>). Following a Norse attack on the Isles in 1209&#150;10 Ragnvald and his son Godred went to Norway, swore fealty to King Inge, and paid tribute. In 1210, when King John was in Ireland in pursuit of Hugh de Lacy and the family of William (III) de Briouze, they gained temporary refuge in the Isle of Man, and John responded by sending a fleet to ravage the island in Ragnvald's absence. Two years later Ragnvald became King John's liegeman and was granted a knight's fee at Carlingford in Ireland, and an annual allowance of wheat, while the king's officials in Ireland were ordered to assist in destroying Ragnvald's enemies. In 1214 the mariners of Ireland were prohibited from entering the lands of Ragnvald. On several occasions in 1218 letters of safe conduct were granted to him to come to the English court &#145;to amend the excesses of his men done both in England and Ireland on the king's subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar &hellip; Ireland</span>, 1.828), and by September of the following year he is recorded as having done homage to Henry III. At the same time, however, Ragnvald declared that he held the Isle of Man, his by hereditary right, as a fief of the papal see, an offer that resulted, in 1223, in Honorius III taking Ragnvald and his realm under papal protection, in return for an annual payment of 12 marks. Ragnvald reported to Henry III in November 1220 that the king of Norway &#145;lays snares for him and threatens his land with evil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar &hellip; Ireland</span>, 1.976), whereupon the justiciar of Ireland was ordered to defend the kingdom of the Isles from Norse attack.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1224 Ragnvald's brother &Oacute;l&aacute;f landed his fleet at Ronaldsway and forced Ragnvald to divide the kingdom between them, Ragnvald retaining Man, some of the Isles, and the title of king, &Oacute;l&aacute;f being granted the rest. In the following year Ragnvald was joined by Alan of Galloway in an attempt to recover the entire kingdom which failed because the Manxmen were unwilling to oppose &Oacute;l&aacute;f. Shortly afterwards Ragnvald gave his daughter in marriage to Alan's illegitimate son Thomas, and thereby so angered the inhabitants of Man that in 1226 they sent for &Oacute;l&aacute;f and made him their king. In April 1228 Henry III issued a safe conduct for &Oacute;l&aacute;f to come to him to make peace with Ragnvald, but in the same year, when &Oacute;l&aacute;f was absent in the Isles, Ragnvald plundered Man in the company of Alan of Galloway, so that &#145;the southern part of Man was practically reduced to a desert&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cronica regum Mannie et Insularum</span>, fol. 43<i>v</i>). &Oacute;l&aacute;f arrived, put them to flight, and regained the kingship, but in the following winter Ragnvald unexpectedly returned from Galloway, and won the allegiance of the men of the south of the island, while &Oacute;l&aacute;f retained the support of those of the north. On 14 February 1229 the brothers did battle at Tynwald, during the course of which Ragnvald was assassinated. His body was brought by the monks of Rushen to St Mary's Abbey, Furness, and buried in the place he had chosen while living. He left at least one son, Godred Dond (Godred the Brown-haired) who, though mutilated by &Oacute;l&aacute;f's men in 1223, briefly succeeded him.<br>
