<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Shane</span> <span class="st"> [Sean O'Neill]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1567), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20767/', "Conn Bacach O'Neill, first earl of Tyrone (c.1482&#150;1559)")</script>, chieftain, and his second wife, Sorcha (<i>d</i>. 1530), daughter of Hugh Oge O'Neill, chief of the Clandeboye O'Neills. Upon his mother's death in 1530 Shane was fostered out to the O'Donnellys, the hereditary marshals to the O'Neills. Conn's decision to foster Shane out to a lesser dependent family, rather than to an existing or potential ally, was probably due to the fact that he had at least five much older sons. Yet neither Shane's supernumerary status nor his infancy prevented his abduction in 1531 by Niall Conallach, Conn's principal rival for the O'Neill chieftaincy. Conn survived the leadership challenge and Shane was returned to his foster family, with whom he remained until reaching adulthood. During this time the O'Neill lordship underwent rapid change culminating in the surrender by Conn in 1542 of both his kingdom and his Gaelic title in exchange for the earldom of Tyrone; his eldest son, Mathew O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1557), was concurrently created baron of Dungannon, with right of succession to the earldom. But Shane, still in adolescence, remained a discounted quantity, wholly excluded from both the detailed negotiations preceding the settlement and the formal indenture with the crown.<h2>
<a name="ShanesrisewithintheONeilllordship15481558"></a>Shane's rise within the O'Neill lordship, 1548&#150;1558</h2>Shane led an army against the Clandeboye O'Neills in 1548 and in the course of the action killed the chief's son. The attack was part of Tyrone's effort to exert control over the failing Clandeboye lordship, which was being gradually undermined by the MacDonalds, the so-called &#145;Scots&#146;, who were emigrating from the western isles. The government shared his desire to arrest the advancing MacDonalds and deployed a garrison at Newry, co. Down, against them. But disputes soon arose between the earl and several aggressive English captains who began raiding Tyrone with impunity. The English had, moreover, begun elevating Dungannon at his father's expense in a premature succession dispute. As the region descended into a triangular war between the earl and Dungannon and his brothers, who exploited their father's weakness in pursuit of their own interests, Tyrone came increasingly to rely on Shane, whose victory in Clandeboye had proved his ability and assured his popularity among the O'Neills. Tyrone's arrest and detention in Dublin in May 1551 provided Shane with an opportunity to assert his independence while nominally defending his father's interests.<br>
<br>Tyrone's removal simplified the situation by uniting Shane and his older brothers against Dungannon, upon whom the blame for their father's imprisonment was squarely placed. It was Shane, however, who rose to prominence, assuming responsibility for Tyrone in his father's absence. Recognizing this, Dungannon and Nicholas Bagenal, marshal of the army, attempted to negotiate or, if possible, capture him in October 1551. Following Dungannon's failure to accomplish this, Shane agreed to talk, revealing that he had been acting on &#145;instructions receavyd from his father sithens his laste repayre to Dublin&#146; and that &#145;he shulde submit him sellfe to no man tylle his father returne&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 61/3/56). Shane, however, accepted a truce and agreed to acknowledge Dungannon's authority. But Dungannon's credibility among the O'Neills was in ruin, and in spring 1552 Shane marched into Dungannon, in Tyrone, unopposed taking &pound;800 worth of treasure which, he claimed, belonged to his father. He subsequently sought support for his actions among other Irish chiefs and even made peaceful overtures towards the MacDonalds. Hearing of this, Sir Thomas Cusack, lord chancellor, travelled to Dungannon to learn of Shane's intentions. He perceived in him &#145;but pryde, stubbornes, and all bent to do what he coulde to distroy the pore countrey&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 61/4/43). Upon Cusack's departure Shane exercised his independence by defiantly burning the earl's house. In December the government released the aged Tyrone in the hope that Shane would acknowledge his father's authority and that the O'Neills would assist in expelling the Scots from Ulster.<br>
<br>Tyrone's restoration, however, failed to achieve either objective because it neglected to address the principal cause of instability in the region: the discrepancy between English and Gaelic laws of succession. Shane's efforts to achieve recognition as <i>t&aacute;naiste</i> were misinterpreted as simple recalcitrance and the earl's reconciliation with Dungannon upon his return, coupled with his adherence to the English law of succession by primogeniture, reinforced his youngest son's belief that his only means of redress was by the sword. Thus a dangerous situation developed where two successors existed concurrently, one by Gaelic right, the other by English. Upon his reappointment as deputy in November 1553 Sir Anthony St Leger, the architect of the settlement of 1542, lent tacit recognition to Shane's position by awarding him a generous royal pension. The support of Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare, for Shane against a rival O'Neill faction in 1554 clouded the question of legitimacy further while echoing an earlier Geraldine&#150;O'Neill alliance. In the same year Tyrone and Dungannon assembled an army to attack the Scots in Clandeboye and to demonstrate their collective strength, but Shane, who by this time had married James MacDonald's daughter, Katherine, maintained his alliance with the MacDonalds and the attacking army was routed. Shane was now the dominant force among the O'Neills. Yet the government failed either to recognize his Gaelic right to the chieftaincy or to uphold vigorously Dungannon's English claim to the earldom. The new lord deputy, Thomas Radcliffe, Lord Fitzwalter, pardoned Shane in 1556 for his recent confederation with the Scots, but similarly ignored the question of succession. This hesitation created a power vacuum that Shane exploited to his advantage.<br>
<br>In 1557 Shane assembled a large army and attacked Tyrconnell. He hoped to re-establish traditional O'Neill suzerainty throughout Ulster by compelling the O'Donnells to submit to his authority &#145;so that there should be but one king in Ulster for the future&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1557). A victory, moreover, would make his position impossible for the government to ignore. The expedition, however, ended in disaster when Shane's army was defeated at Cnoc Buidhbh, near Strabane in Tyrone, ironically the place where his father met with a similar discomfiture, in pursuit of the same goal in 1522. However, a serious challenge to Shane's leadership failed to materialize: the O'Donnells were wracked by internal dissension and were unable to consolidate their victory, the earl was old and sickly and Dungannon lacked support among the O'Neills. The government of Mary I, moreover, failed to pursue any consistent policy towards O'Neill or Ulster save a resolution to expel the Scots. When in 1557 the third earl of Sussex (Fitzwalter) called upon the O'Neills to aid in a campaign against the Scots, Shane was conveniently absent. In October Sussex twice burned Armagh in search of Shane, but failed on both occasions to engage him. Shane&#151;having secured another pardon in December&#151;was sufficiently confident in his position and at last moved against Dungannon, orchestrating his assassination in 1558. Tyrone subsequently escaped to the pale, where he died the following year. Dungannon's young son Brian O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1562) inherited the title second baron of Dungannon, but because of his youth and Shane's strength he did not accede to the earldom to which he was entitled by English law.<h2>
<a name="ShaneschieftaincythepursuitoftheearldomofTyrone15581562"></a>Shane's chieftaincy: the pursuit of the earldom of Tyrone, 1558&#150;1562</h2>Tyrone died by 16 July 1559 and Shane was elected O'Neill. This Gaelic distinction, however, did not abrogate or supersede the vacant English title and Shane immediately sought recognition as his father's legitimate successor to the earldom. Elizabeth I was keen to avoid conflict and did not have a viable alternative. She proved receptive to his claim and in July authorized Sussex to recognize him as earl. Yet the absence of trust between Shane and Sussex, coupled with the former's refusal to allow English arbiters to settle his disputes with lesser Ulster chiefs, made the subsequent negotiations impossible. In an effort to circumvent Sussex, Shane, through his trusted foster brother Terence Donnelly, dean of Armagh, petitioned the queen for recognition of his position, noting that the &#145;rude uncyvill and disobedient people&#146; of his lordship &#145;will fall to cyvilite and here after be faithfull obedyent and trew subjectes&#146; if his requests were granted  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/1/79). Sussex, however, vilified Shane, convincing Elizabeth to rescind her offer of the earldom and pursue a more aggressive policy. Within a year any hope of peace was lost as Shane resumed raiding the pale's northern marches and the queen authorized Sussex to &#145;practise with such other subjects as be neighbours unto him, by reward or otherwise, by whom ye may most probably reform the said Shane, or otherwise by our force to compel him to stand to your order and governance&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 1.292). In summer 1560 Sussex, now lord lieutenant, made a feeble attempt to form an English-backed alliance of Ulster chiefs to challenge Shane's authority. However, in August Shane, demonstrating his impressive military capabilities, marched through Ulster intimidating Sussex's would-be allies. Elizabeth subsequently authorized his subjugation and the restitution of Dungannon's rights to the barony.<br>
<br>Sussex, with a reinforced English army, was at last free to wage war openly against Shane. But militarily this presented him with several problems: Shane was master of a sprawling lordship in Ireland's most Gaelic province which had remained consistently militarized for over a decade, he employed thousands of Scottish mercenaries, and was continually surrounded by hundreds of fiercely loyal bodyguards. Sussex was forced to rely on another hastily constructed alliance of Ulster chiefs to maintain a decisive advantage. The most important of these chiefs was Calvagh O'Donnell, who alone was capable of opening up a second front to the north-west of Shane's lordship. In June 1561 Sussex printed a proclamation detailing Shane's offences since 1556 as a public declaration of war. Shane, however, had already struck, capturing O'Donnell and his wife, Katherine <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacLean (<i>d</i>. 1588), dowager countess of Argyll, in late May. This wrong-footed the lord lieutenant, denying him his second front, and allowed Shane to extend his influence into Tyrconnell. Shane established a firmer foothold in Tyrconnell about 1560 when he divorced his wife and married Calvagh and Katherine O'Donnell's daughter, Mary, who, according to the four masters, &#145;died of horror, loathing, grief and deep anguish, in consequence of the severity of the imprisonment inflicted on her father&#146; in May 1561  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1561). With O'Donnell as a bargaining tool and the freedom to retreat into the fastness of Tyrconnell, Shane became an elusive enemy for the increasingly frustrated Sussex.<br>
<br>Sussex staked his political reputation in Ireland on effectively dealing with Shane. In early 1561 he favoured Shane's repair to England to submit to Elizabeth. However, by summer he had become convinced that English rule in Ireland hinged on Shane's subjugation. For Sussex, Shane's imprisonment of O'Donnell&#151;to whom the government had lately offered an earldom&#151;and his retention of Katherine O'Donnell as his mistress were merely the latest in a series of outrages which demanded an overwhelming military response. Shane, however, was not without allies and they continued to hold out the more conciliatory option of a visit to court. Through Kildare and the under-treasurer, Sir Henry Sidney, who stood as godfather to Shane's child in 1559, he sought to obtain money and sureties for his safe conduct to England. His repeated efforts to plead his case to the queen in person stemmed from his worsening relationship with Sussex which had, by 1561, degenerated into little more than bitter accusations and counter-accusations. In a letter to Sussex in June Shane wrote:<blockquote>You began with a conquest in my land without cause, and so long as ther be any Englysh man in my contre against my wyll, I wyll not send agreement nor message unto you from hence forthe, but wyll send my complaint in another way to the Quenes Majestie to declare unto her Grace howe youe interupted my going. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/4/22 viii)</blockquote>But Sussex was determined to eliminate Shane before he could secure an audience with Elizabeth, and, in July, he marched into Tyrone. Shane withdrew to Tyrconnell and waited until the advancing army's supplies grew low; and upon their return towards Armagh mounted a successful attack on the rearguard. A failed effort to have Shane assassinated in August and an expensive, but ultimately ineffectual, campaign in September undermined further support for Sussex's coercive policy in Ulster. The queen, her confidence in Sussex's methods shaken, authorized Kildare to treat with Shane in August. Kildare brokered a settlement by October. Yet it was Shane who dictated its terms, receiving &pound;2000 to defray the expenses of a journey to court, a pardon, and a safe conduct signed by five Irish earls. Aware of the dangers of leaving his country, but confident in the guarantees he had painstakingly procured, he consented to go to England. Sussex warned &#145;yf Shane be overthrowen all is settled, yf Shane settell all is overthrowen&#146; but was defeated and humiliated  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/4/37). He followed Shane to court to defend his conduct and salvage his reputation.<h2>
<a name="Shanessubmissionthelegacyofsurrenderandregrant1562"></a>Shane's submission: the legacy of surrender and regrant, 1562</h2>Shane made his formal submission to Elizabeth on 6 January 1562. Unlike his father, who appeared at court in October 1542 in English dress and flanked by English nobility, Shane wore his native costume and was surrounded by a retinue of elaborately adorned galloglass. The scene, given added effect by Shane's Gaelic speech and his prostration before the queen, created a stir at court and was described, some years later, by William Camden:<blockquote>Shane O'Neill came out of Ireland that year as promised, surrounded by Galloglass for security, with bare heads, ash-coloured hanging curls, golden saffron undershirts, if not the colour of infected human urine, loose sleeves, short tunics, and shaggy lace: the English nobility followed with as much wonderment as if they had come from China or America. (Camden, 69)</blockquote>Shane's presence at court, however, went beyond mere ceremony. Accompanied by advisers intimately familiar both with Gaelic and English law and administration, he put forward his case for the earldom. The main point of contention was the settlement of 1542, which Shane held to be invalid on account of Dungannon's illegitimacy. He alleged that his half-brother was not an O'Neill, but rather the son of a Dundalk blacksmith adopted in adolescence by his father. He pressed for renegotiation of the settlement on account of his own legitimacy and his status as the O'Neills' elected leader. Sussex, who arrived in February, however, insisted that the settlement of 1542 was a submission rather than a contract and that the sovereign alone had the authority to revoke its terms. Dungannon, he contended, was Tyrone's accepted heir and he dismissed his illegitimacy as irrelevant to Shane's case. To this Shane replied that his father was merely an &#145;officer&#146; of his people incapable of being made owner of his country or investing the succession in an illegitimate child. Sussex replied that Gaelic political custom had no standing in English law.<br>
<br>The argument was familiar; it dated back to 1560, when a number of questions were put to Shane concerning his right to the earldom. His answers and counter-questions, however, exposed more fundamental questions concerning crown rights in Ulster and the legitimacy of Gaelic custom <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> English custom in Ireland. His argument could be applied to every Gaelic lordship and, if successful, threatened to undo painstakingly negotiated submissions. Shane's case placed the entire policy of surrender and regrant under examination and revealed that many Gaelic and English legal customs were simply irreconcilable. Yet the crown could not ignore the reality of his Gaelic lordship in Ulster, and over the following months continued negotiating towards an acceptable settlement without addressing these irreconcilable differences that lay at the heart of the problem. Elizabeth's decision in March to postpone her judgment on the matter of the earldom until Dungannon was interviewed convinced Shane that the negotiations were futile. Dungannon's murder on 12 April 1562 by his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20786/', "Turlough Luineach O'Neill")</script>, amid rumours of a coup in Tyrone, however, delivered the final blow to negotiations as Shane sought immediate licence to return to Ireland. But before his departure Shane hastily agreed to an indenture that acknowledged his &#145;captaincy&#146; of the O'Neills, but circumscribed his traditional suzerainty in Ulster.<br>
<br>On another level, the failure of Shane's visit can be attributed to court politics. Sussex was concerned that Shane's intimacy with Kildare would unite Old English and Gaelic Irish in opposition to his government in Ireland. Kildare's successful bid to induce Shane to repair to court, moreover, was a humiliating defeat for Sussex and was perceived by many palesmen as vindication of Kildare's more conciliatory methods for the governance of Ireland. Sir Robert Dudley, Elizabeth's favourite, was alive to Kildare's ascendancy and the opportunities for patronage in Ireland; but his lavish entertainment of the earl and Shane during their stay at court aroused the attention of his rival for the queen's attention, Sir William Cecil, principal secretary. Cecil was determined to frustrate Dudley's efforts to establish an affinity in Ireland and used his own influence with Elizabeth to ensure Sussex's arguments were greeted favourably. Shane, moreover, was an obstacle to Cecil's ongoing negotiations with Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll. Cecil had, for several years, been urging Argyll to employ his forces to bring pressure to bear on Shane and dislodge the Scots from Ulster, but Shane's capture of Argyll's stepmother, Katherine O'Donnell, in 1561 frustrated Cecil's plans. Ultimately it was Cecil who supported Sussex's arguments, delayed Shane's stay for four months, and convinced the queen to suspend judgment on Shane's right to the earldom. Shane's treatment reveals how far court politics obstructed consistent crown policy under Elizabeth. Dungannon's murder coupled with rumours of Shane's intrigues with Alvaro de la Quadra, the Spanish ambassador in England, however, forced Cecil to discontinue his strategy and expedite Shane's bid to return to Ireland.<h2>
<a name="ShaneshegemonyinUlster15621566"></a>Shane's hegemony in Ulster, 1562&#150;1566</h2>Upon his return to Ireland on 26 May 1562, Shane proceeded directly to Tyrone where he quickly reasserted his authority, having heard that Turlough Luineach had proclaimed himself O'Neill on 23 May. He subsequently rounded on the neighbouring Ulster chiefs who had, in his absence, pledged to resist his authority. This behaviour clearly violated the terms of his indenture, which stated that grievances between Shane and other Ulster chiefs should be subject to English arbitration. But Sussex, who returned as deputy in July, found the indenture's terms impossible to enforce without resorting to full-scale war. Elizabeth&#151;loath to expend her limited resources on war in Ulster only months after Shane's submission&#151;vacillated. Shane, meanwhile, tightened his grip on Ulster through raiding the pale, attacking the English garrison at Armagh, and opening a second front against the O'Donnells. In September Sussex called for Shane and the Ulster chiefs to attend him at Dundalk, co. Louth, but Shane, whose distrust of the lord lieutenant had not been diluted, refused. Sussex's continued presence made war a certainty and in spring 1563 he launched a campaign against Shane. However, it was poorly organized and under-funded. Despite Sussex's ostensibly successful efforts to detach Shane's most ardent supporters, the operation collapsed having accomplished nothing. By July Elizabeth, influenced by Dudley and his supporters at court, decided to change tack and pursue an inexpensive conciliatory strategy.<br>
<br>Cusack and Kildare met Shane at Drumcree, co. Meath, in September and negotiated a treaty. This granted Shane nearly all the demands that he had failed to secure at court and nullified the indenture that he had signed in April, exempted him from attending the queen's governor in Ireland, and acknowledged him &#145;to have all the pre-eminence, jurisdiction, and dominions which his predecessors had, and particularly over the Lords subject to him&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 1.239). This last clause gave tacit recognition to the Gaelic tract known as <span class="italic">Ceart U&iacute; N&eacute;ill</span>, the customary right of O'Neill over the province of Ulster. The tract obliged the many lesser Ulster chiefs to join O'Neill in a hosting, to provide billets for his troops, and to pay fixed tributes. Cusack and Kildare, however, went too far in their conciliatory efforts, virtually establishing Shane as an independent entity in Ulster. Elizabeth modified the treaty, insisting that Shane attend her governor, provided assurances were given for his safety, and that differences between him and the government be referred to arbitration. None the less this reflected a volte-face in crown policy towards Shane and, in the final draft, acknowledged his right to accede to the earldom following an examination at the next Irish parliament of the letters patent granted in 1542. The treaty confirmed Sussex's eclipse and Shane&#151;&#145;ever ready to change his wife to suit his policies&#146;&#151;added insult to injury by resuming his efforts to wed Sussex's sister as proof of his willingness to embrace English civility  (Hogan, &#145;Shane O'Neill&#146;, 168). A favourable settlement with the government concluded, Shane confidently turned his attention to the governance of Ulster.<br>
<br>In spring 1564 Shane released O'Donnell from captivity on condition that he relinquish his claim to Lifford Castle and the Inishowen peninsula, co. Donegal. O'Donnell agreed, but, once freed, refused to honour his word and fled to Dublin to reveal the enormity of Shane's cruelty and to appeal for assistance. During his absence Shane invaded Tyrconnell and wasted much of the country. The government, however, was not prepared to risk a confrontation with him following Drumcree and ignored O'Donnell's pleas. Shane had, moreover, offered to aid the government in the expulsion of the Scots. His motivation for such a gesture was twofold: first, it demonstrated his loyalty to the crown and would, he hoped, expedite the settlement of the earldom in his favour; second, it would remove the final obstacle to his goal of achieving O'Neill hegemony across Ulster. A letter from the earl of Leicester (Dudley) in late summer urging Shane to do something to merit Elizabeth's favour pushed him into action. Shane, denied the English aid for which he petitioned, marched against the Scots in September, but following an encounter near Coleraine was defeated. The defeat revealed weaknesses in Shane's military machine&#151;particularly when acting in the offensive in an open confrontation&#151;and forced him to invade Tyrconnell in October to replenish supplies and boost morale. He was capable of holding the O'Neills and their septs together through his standing and his personality but he was a poor commander. The invasion also saw the occupation of certain castles, raising the ominous prospect of permanent O'Neill settlements in Tyrconnell.<br>
<br>By spring 1565 Shane had grown impatient with Elizabeth's failure to call the parliament that would ratify the Drumcree treaty and assure his accession to the earldom. The earldom and the right of Dungannon and his sons to the succession hung over Shane's head like the sword of Damocles for over a decade and he was determined to force a resolution of the matter. In April he assembled a large force and marched towards Clandeboye, co. Antrim. With the support of the local chiefs, he cut passes in the woods and surprised the MacDonalds in the Glens and the Route, forcing them back upon their fortress at Red Bay. Shane destroyed the fortress and marched to Ballycastle, where he overwhelmed a newly reinforced Scottish contingent in the valley of Glenshesk, both in co. Antrim, on 2 May. Two powerful chiefs, James and Sorley Boy MacDonald, were captured and Shane proceeded to destroy every vestige of Scottish occupation along the Antrim coast. His victory was complete. He did not withdraw, however, and, in an unprecedented move by a Gaelic chief, began colonizing the Glens, the Route, and Clandeboye with his own people to maintain his influence and dissuade future Scottish encroachment. That summer he unexpectedly attacked the English garrisons at Newry and Dundrum, co. Down, before invading northern Connaught in the autumn to reassert traditional O'Neill suzerainty. Shane's power reached its apogee and his refusal to release his MacDonald captives won him the attention of Mary, queen of Scots, and Argyll, who saw him as a powerful potential ally against Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Running concurrently with Shane's aggressive military strategy was an effective diplomatic offensive waged with allies to influence the government's political policy towards Ulster. Chief among these allies was Donnelly who, following Drumcree, repeatedly pointed out Shane's conformity and willingness to serve the crown. Shane dispatched him to England to relate the manner of his victory over the Scots and press his claims for the earldom. Together with Robert Fleming, he portrayed Shane as a dutiful subject even as his actions grew bolder late in 1565. Cusack, who tied his reputation and political career to the conciliatory measures embodied in Drumcree, joined Shane's allies in convincing the government of the latter's loyalty. Leicester also contributed to Shane's diplomatic offensive by preserving his reputation at court. It was Shane, however, who maintained the preponderance of correspondence with the government, firmly setting out his demands and proposals to the queen, the privy council, and the Irish privy council. But his diplomatic offensive went beyond England. Rumours of his negotiations with Mary or Argyll abounded towards the close of 1565 and in the previous summer Shane had entertained David Wolfe, the papal nuncio, in Tyrone. Moreover, he hoped to elevate Donnelly to the see of Armagh and denied the bishopric of Down and Connor to the crown's choice, James Mac Caghwell, in May, retaining instead his brother, who held the position through a grant procured from Rome. By 1566 his military aggressions coupled with his wide-ranging diplomatic efforts cost him the support of his allies in Dublin and at court, and convinced the crown to abandon its conciliatory policy in Ulster and to seek his destruction. Reports filtered back to England that he was deeply critical of the queen when drunk.<h2>
<a name="ShanesincompatibilitywiththeTudorstate15661567"></a>Shane's incompatibility with the Tudor state, 1566&#150;1567</h2>Sidney was appointed lord deputy on 13 October 1565 and arrived in Ireland on 20 January 1566. He had been convinced for months of the necessity for Shane's destruction, but was unable to persuade Elizabeth to commit to all-out war. Following Shane's refusal to meet him on several occasions, Sidney wrote to Leicester:<blockquote>I believe Lucifer was never puft up with more pryde nor ambytyon than that Onelr [O'Neill] ys &hellip; he continually kepyth 600 armed men &hellip; about him, he ys able to bring to the field a thousand horsmen and 4,000 footmen; he hath already in Dundrum, as I am credibly advertysed 200 toon of wyne and mutch more he lokyth for; he ys the only strong man of Ireland; hys cuntre was never so rytch nor so inhabited; he armyth and weaponnyth all the peasantes of his cuntre, the first that ever so dyd of an Iryshman; he hath agentys continually in the coor [court] of Scotland and with dyvers potentates of the Irysh Scottes. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/16/29)</blockquote>The letter found its way to Elizabeth and the privy council, who recognized the need for Shane's extirpation; but an independent observer, Sir Francis Knollys, was dispatched to conduct a review of the state of Ulster before any resources were released. Knollys's report eventually concluded that war was unavoidable and Shane was proclaimed a traitor in August. Shane, meanwhile, exploited the delay by making preparations for war. He tightened his grip over his septs, resumed raids on the pale, and evacuated Dungannon and Benburb, co. Armagh. His diplomatic intrigues, moreover, stretched from Munster to Scotland as he sought support both from Sir John Fitzgerald, the brother of Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, and at Mary's court. He even approached the Scots offering to &#145;put away&#146; Katherine O'Donnell, whom he married in 1565, and marry James MacDonald's widow. Most remarkably, however, Shane donned the mantle of defender of Catholicism against English heresy and appealed to Charles IX for 5000 French troops. Foreign or domestic aid, however, was not forthcoming and his military capability was no match for Sidney's professional army, which marched north. Sidney's army traversed Tyrone unopposed leaving a garrison at Derry and restoring O'Donnell. In December Shane sued for peace, but his efforts were rejected.<br>
<br>In spring 1567 Shane marched a large force into Tyrconnell to reassert his authority. The O'Donnells, however, laid aside their differences and, in a concerted effort to repel the invader, attacked his encampment at Farsetmore. Shane's men were forced back upon the swollen River Swilly, which carried hundreds to their deaths. He narrowly escaped, but the battle claimed many of his leading officers. The defeat was disastrous and, sensing his vulnerability, his followers and allies proceeded to abandon him. As Sidney marched north contenders for the chieftaincy and the earldom began to emerge. The Scots, moreover, resumed their settlements in Antrim and pushed west. In desperation Shane considered surrendering unconditionally to the lord deputy, but decided instead to seek reconciliation with the MacDonalds, whose chief, Sorley Boy, remained his captive. Shane travelled to Cushendun, co. Antrim, on 31 May to parley with the MacDonalds. The negotiations&#151;conducted in an open field far removed from their respective forces&#151;continued for two days with Shane hoping to secure much needed reinforcements in exchange for Sorley Boy's release. On 2 June the Scots fell upon him, perhaps provoked by his intemperate speech, killing him by cutting his throat before hacking him to pieces along with five advisers accompanying him. The Scots had no shortage of reasons to seek Shane's murder, but it was his weakness and desperation that afforded them such a golden opportunity. Edmund Campion noted: &#145;Thus the wretched man ended, who might have lived like a Prince, had he not quenched the sparkes of grace that appeared in him, with arrogancy and contempt against his prince&#146;  (Campion, 130). The annals of Loch C&eacute; recorded that Shane was &#145;Lord of the Ultonian province, and royal heir of Erinn without dispute&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Loch C&eacute;</span>, s.a. 1567). Shane's body, hastily buried at Glenarm and wrapped in a kerne's shirt, was later exhumed and his head was sent &#145;pickled in a pipkin&#146; to Sidney, who had it placed on a pole over Dublin Castle  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was attainted, his lands declared forfeit, and the title of O'Neill extinguished in 1569 by act of the very parliament which was, according to the Drumcree treaty, to have formalized his accession to the earldom. He was succeeded by Turlough Luineach and was survived by Katherine O'Donnell and at least ten identifiable sons. His sons were too young in 1567 to challenge Turlough Luineach but within a decade emerged as a political faction among the O'Neills known as the MacShanes.<br>
<br>Historical interpretations of Shane's career have, until recently, been inextricably linked with the myth surrounding his character: &#145;Shane the Proud&#146;, a quintessentially Gaelic chief whose overweening ambition and pride upset the balance of power in Ulster and plunged the province into unprecedented chaos for fifteen years. His ascendancy, motivated only by pride and maintained through cruelty, was a fluke leaving no tangible legacy save destruction. Accordingly, detailed studies of Shane and the complicated social and political world he inhabited have been deemed unnecessary. This interpretation was advanced during his lifetime primarily by English politicians and continued by near contemporary English historians like Campion and John Hooker. To the Tudor mind Shane's savagery exemplified the depths to which an unrestrained and uncivilized Gaelic chief might sink. Nineteenth-century English historians&#151;drawing on these contemporary and near contemporary sources&#151;accepted this interpretation without question. Robert Dunlop concluded: &#145;judged even by the lax standard of his age, he was a bad man&#151;a glutton, a drunkard, a coward, a bully, an adulterer, and a murderer&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Irish nationalist historians, keen to revise hostile English histories of Gaelic chiefs, found it difficult to accommodate Shane within their historical tradition. When they scratched the surface of the standing English interpretation, they found instances of Shane's sexual indiscretion, an ambivalent attitude towards his fellow Gael, and his avid pursuit of English civility. Thus the majority of nationalist historians ignored him, accepting the traditional interpretation of his character and career. Only recently have historians begun to offer a reappraisal of his significance in the Tudor period and to dispel the myths surrounding his character. Shane is re-emerging as an innovative and highly organized leader who transformed his lordship into an often effective military machine, the most powerful force Gaelic Ireland had yet witnessed. That he was ambitious cannot be disputed, but little else can be said about him as an individual. It was his ambition, however, that was most crucial. Shane's aggressive ambition, pursued in the periphery of both the English and Gaelic worlds, frustrated the cultural and political advance of an increasingly centralized Tudor state and made his destruction inevitable.<br>
