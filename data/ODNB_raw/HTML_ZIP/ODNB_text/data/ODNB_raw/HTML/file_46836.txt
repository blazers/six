<span class="headword">Colls,  (John) Howard</span>  (1846&#150;1910), <span class="occ">builder and employers' leader</span>, was born on 30 August 1846 at Camberwell, Surrey, the second son of Benjamin Colls (1813&#150;1878), housepainter and builder, and Elizabeth Jackson. Early in life he acquired practical skills in his father's joinery workshop. In 1867 he married Annie M. McMillan, daughter of shipbuilder Archibald McMillan; they had one son and at least seven daughters. Colls's father, who had been active in local government, ultimately becoming chairman of the City lands committee and thus &#145;first commoner&#146; of the corporation of London, left an estate of less than &pound;18,000 and a relatively small building business. The business passed to Colls and his elder brother William (1842&#150;1893), and thereafter Colls &amp; Sons specialized in building City offices, banks, and similar premises. It retained workshops at 240 Camberwell Road and established premises at Dorking in Surrey from which prepared joinery was brought to be fixed on jobs in the City. As wage costs in Dorking were lower than in London, this was one of the foundations of Colls's business success.<br>
<br>The bulk of Colls &amp; Sons' building work after 1880 was undertaken in the City of London. Its finest City building was probably that for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, constructed in 1889&#150;92. The firm did, however, execute other work, including projects at Stratfield Saye for the duke of Wellington.<br>
<br>Colls was also active in industrial politics. He was vice-president of the National Association of Master Builders of Great Britain, 1885&#150;9, and its president in 1889&#150;90. As president he served on the association's committee on the difficult matter of the form of contract between builder and architect. It has been suggested that he deserves much of the credit for the standard form of building contract agreed in 1903. He was also president of the Institute of Builders, 1887&#150;8. He was president of the Central Association of Master Builders of London in 1890&#150;91. His presidential term was dominated by the eight-hour-day dispute with the London United Trade Committee of Carpenters and Joiners. This dispute was particularly hard-fought and brought building in London to a virtual standstill between May and November 1891. In the main, the master builders were successful: the hours of work were reduced but the rate of payment remained unchanged. For Colls &amp; Sons, however, the decision to increase overtime rates was a setback. Most of its business consisted of alterations and extensions to City offices and many of the contracts could only be carried on outside the working hours of City businesses.<br>
<br>William, Colls's elder brother and subordinate partner, died in 1893. That there was no ill feeling on the part of the elder man is demonstrated by his will, which ensured the continuance of the family firm under Colls's control. Following his brother's death Colls seems to have given up active involvement in the affairs of employers' associations.<br>
<br>Arguably Colls's greatest service to the building industry was in his conduct of the celebrated case of <i>Colls v. Home and Colonial Stores Ltd</i> which went to the House of Lords in 1904. The issue turned on the legal definition of &#145;ancient lights&#146;, the rights of the proprietor of an existing building over light and air and (by implication) against new buildings. The new building in question was erected in Worship Street, Finsbury, by Colls &amp; Sons. The final ruling was that the Home and Colonial Stores was entitled to sufficient air and light for ordinary purposes, but did not have a perpetual right to the same amount as it had previously enjoyed. In effect the law was substantially modified, by means of a judicial review. Previously many of those who had lodged claims and sought injunctions had done so in order to extort compensation. Few of them were genuinely concerned about ventilation or daylight.<br>
<br>Colls became a member of Joseph Chamberlain's tariff commission of which his son-in-law, Francis Elgar, managing director of the Fairfield Engineering and Shipbuilding Company, was also a member. At the end of 1903 the firm of Colls &amp; Sons ceased to exist and was incorporated in the new firm of Trollope and Colls. Colls became joint chairman with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40954/', "George Haward Trollope")</script>. The merger of the two firms was probably facilitated by the shared experience of industrial strife which these two key figures had in common, and their complementary political opinions. Both held Conservative views, although neither sought public office in the Conservative cause. The agreement for the sale of the assets of Colls &amp; Sons to Trollope and Colls, excluding freehold and leasehold property, stipulated a purchase price of &pound;165,375 10<i>s</i>. By comparison the assets of George Trollope &amp; Sons were valued at &pound;234,624 10<i>s</i>., so clearly the Trollopes were the dominant partners in the new firm.<br>
<br>Colls died of a heart attack at or near Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 29 December 1910, while on a sea cruise for his health's sake.<br>
