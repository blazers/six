<span class="headword">Pugh,  (Glanville) Vernon</span>  (1945&#150;2003), <span class="occ">barrister and rugby union administrator</span>, was born in Amman Valley Hospital, Cwmaman, Carmarthenshire, on 5 July 1945, the eldest of the four children of David Glanville Pugh (1919&#150;1988), coalminer, and his wife, Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lewis (<i>b</i>. 1924), of Glyn-moch, near Ammanford. He was educated at Glanamman primary school and Amman Valley grammar school, from where he won an Evan Morgan scholarship to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He graduated in 1966 with first-class honours in law and proceeded to Downing College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of LLM in 1968. On 3 April 1967 he married (Rosalyn) Dorinda Davies (<i>b</i>. 1947), of Gwauncaegurwen, Glamorgan, the daughter of James Glyn Davies, mining geologist. They had three daughters. In 1968&#150;9 he lectured in property and commercial law at Leicester University, and was for the next four years a lecturer in town planning law at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, Cardiff. In the meantime, in 1969 he became Hardwick scholar and member at Lincoln's Inn, and in 1970 a practising barrister with chambers in Cardiff and London specializing in environmental law and town planning, a role that involved him in major schemes like the redevelopment of Cardiff city centre and the regeneration of its docks and waterfront. In 1986 he was appointed a crown court recorder and queen's counsel.<br>
<br>However, it was for the legal acumen and intellectual muscle Pugh brought to the transformation of rugby union from an amateur to a professional sport that he was chiefly notable; indeed, he passed up an invitation to become a high court judge because of his passion for rugby and his interest in its administration. He came from the edge of the west Wales coalfield where the game was an obsession and its working-class followers had never made a fetish of amateurism; despite a long tradition of unofficial payments to players, Pugh well knew that too many rugby players from the Welsh valleys had been forced by economic circumstances to abandon amateur rugby union for the more open financial rewards of the professional game played in the north of England. In 1995 his determination that the game should not be irrevocably bound by what he viewed as an outmoded ideology led him, as chairman of the amateurism committee of the International Rugby Board (IRB), to mastermind and, as chairman of the board itself from 1996, drive through the most revolutionary development in the game's history since the breakaway of the Northern Union, later the professional Rugby League, 100 years earlier.<br>
<br>Pugh seemed to have risen without trace to domination of world rugby. A useful three-quarter and half-back, he played for a number of first- and second-class clubs including Amman United, Pontypridd, Leicester, St Peter's (Cardiff), and Cardiff High School Old Boys. Recognizing that the High School Old Boys would never get very far with such an unglamorous name, Pugh characteristically persuaded them to rebadge themselves as Cardiff Harlequins, and they proceeded under his effective coaching to go a lot further. His links with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) began in controversial circumstances when in 1989 he was invited to chair the union's independent inquiry into the Welsh participation in ostracized (because then apartheid) South Africa's rugby centenary celebrations. The Pugh report was damning of the players and administrators involved, and its author added an unsolicited recommendation advocating wholesale reform of the WRU, which he reckoned was inadequate to the task of running the game in a commercial era. The union sat on this for several years, and when it was eventually leaked to the press in 1993 there was uproar. A motion of no confidence was passed in the entire general committee, who resigned <i>en masse</i>, leaving the inert body of Welsh rugby to be revived by an infusion of new blood headed by Pugh, who was immediately elected WRU chairman, a position he held until 1997.<br>
<br>In 1996 Pugh also became the first elected chairman of the IRB, a post he had already held in 1994&#150;5 on the principle of Buggins's turn, a convention he promptly overthrew. Distressed by the diminishing authority of the IRB, Pugh forced it to recognize that the game it purported to administer was spinning out of its control. The amateur ethos of the game was under severe pressure, especially from the southern hemisphere nations, and if the threats from predatory media moguls like Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch to hijack it were not to materialize there had to be a revolution; it was too late for gradualism. At a historic meeting of the IRB in Paris in August 1995 Pugh overnight propelled the union game into the professional era. Under his subsequent chairmanship membership of the IRB doubled to over 100 countries, including China. He was the driving force behind admitting Italy to what then became the six nations championship in 2000, helped set up the Heineken cup for European clubs and provinces, and was a director and vice-chairman of the rugby world cup from 1996 to 2000. His tenure of the chairmanship of the IRB was not without its critics. He was seen as concentrating too much power in his own hands and having rushed through the transition to professionalism; although as a Welshman he recognized the needs of smaller countries for greater funding, the so-called &#145;dash for cash&#146; disadvantaged smaller rugby nations like Argentina, Romania, the Pacific islands, and even the Celtic countries, thereby creating an imbalance in the game globally. Nevertheless, in March 2000 he was re-elected chairman of the IRB for a further four years, at the time the only Briton to be at the head of any major international sporting body.<br>
<br>Pugh died from cancer at Holme Tower Hospice, Bridgeman Road, Penarth, near Cardiff, on 24 April 2003, and was buried at Thornhill cemetery on 2 May. He was survived by his wife and daughters. Short, bespectacled, and in later years somewhat portly, he may not have looked like a revolutionary, but he was one: a man of formidable intellect and persuasive charm, disarmingly polite to those who crossed him, he was the consummate sports politician.<br>
