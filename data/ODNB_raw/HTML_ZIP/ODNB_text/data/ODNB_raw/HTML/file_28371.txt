<span class="headword">Waddington,  Charles</span>  (1796&#150;1858), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, fifth son of William Waddington of Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Grace Valentine, daughter of Henry Sykes of London, was born at 124 Sloane Street, Brompton, London, on 24 October 1796. After Addiscombe College he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bombay Engineers on 3 April 1813, and arrived in India on 22 May 1814. He accompanied Colonel Kennedy's force to the Konkan, and his services at the assaults of Madanghar (80 miles south-east of Bombay) and of Jamba were favourably mentioned (general orders, 15 February 1818). Towards the end of 1819 he went home on furlough, and was promoted lieutenant on 16 November 1820.<br>
<br>In 1822 Waddington married Anne Rebecca, daughter of John Pinchard of Taunton, Somerset, and they had six sons and two daughters; she survived him. Their eldest son, William (<i>b</i>. 1823), colonel in the Bombay staff corps, served in Persia (1856&#150;7), and became JP for Wiltshire. Another son, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1827), was major-general of the Bombay staff corps.<br>
<br>On his return to India in 1823 Waddington acted as executive engineer at Baroda. He was promoted captain on 29 July 1825, and appointed in October executive engineer of the Baroda subsidiary force. In November 1827 he was moved to Bombay as civil engineer at the presidency, and in August 1828 acted also as superintending engineer. He was appointed to the command of the engineer corps and to take charge of the Engineer Institution in October 1830. In September 1834 he commanded the engineers at Sirur, returning to the presidency as superintending engineer in January 1835.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1838 Waddington was promoted major, and in May 1839 was appointed superintending engineer of the southern provinces. In September 1841 he went to Sind as commanding engineer. He accompanied Major-General Richard England in his march through the Bolan Pass in the autumn of 1842, and was mentioned in dispatches. On 4 November 1842 he was appointed commanding engineer in Baluchistan as well as Sind. He accompanied Sir Charles Napier as commanding engineer of his force in the celebrated march of 82 miles from Dijikote on 6 January 1843 to Imamgarh, where they arrived on 12 January. Instructed to demolish the fort, Waddington fired his mines on 15 January. He himself lit the fuses of three mines, and was bending over the train of one when his assistant called upon him to run as the other mines were about to explode. But he deliberately ensured that the fuse was well alight before he walked away amid a storm of bursting mines. Napier mentioned him in his dispatch of 22 January 1843 for his bravery. He called it a grand action, but advised Waddington that he would have done better to appreciate his own worth and reserve his heroism for an occasion where it might turn the crisis of a war.<br>
<br>Waddington took part in the battle of Miani on 17 February 1843, where he acted as aide-de-camp to Napier, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was also at the battle of Hyderabad, or Dabo, on 24 March, and was again mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel and made a CB for his services in Sind.<br>
<br>After a furlough in England, Waddington was employed in special duty at Poona until October 1847, when he was appointed superintending and executive engineer at Aden, altered to chief engineer in April 1851. He was promoted colonel on 24 November 1853, and major-general on 28 November 1854. On 4 May 1854 he was appointed chief engineer in the public works department, Bombay, and his services in preparing the Persian expedition received official acknowledgement. In November 1857 he was appointed to the command in Sind. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers</span>. In September 1858 he was compelled by ill health to leave India, and he died at Cox's Hotel, 55 Jermyn Street, St James, London, on 22 November of that year.<br>
