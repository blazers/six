<span class="headword">&AElig;thelweard <span class="st"> [Ethelwerd]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 998?), <span class="occ">chronicler and magnate</span>, was ealdorman of south-western England. He styled himself &#145;Patricius Consul Fabius Quaestor&#146;, a latinization of &#145;&AElig;thel-/ealdorman/Fabius/-weard&#146;. He was the father of &AElig;thelm&aelig;r, grandfather of one &AElig;thelweard and grandfather-in-law of another: all also ealdormen, and two of the same south-western ealdormanry as &AElig;thelweard himself. He is important for his family's status as outlying members of the royal dynasty, and as holders over three generations of a key post in Anglo-Saxon government; but more important for the culture that made him and his son patrons of the homilist &AElig;lfric of Eynsham, and that led him to produce a remarkable Latin version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> (down to 975). This was written for Abbess Matilda of Essen, who was descended from King Alfred; &AElig;thelweard's prefatory letter to her claims descent from &AElig;thelred I, Alfred's elder brother, and he later says that &AElig;thelred was his <i>atavus</i> (great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, great-great-great-grandfather, or merely ancestor).<br>
<br>More light may be shed on &AElig;thelweard's family by the charter whereby his son &AElig;thelm&aelig;r founded Eynsham Abbey (1005). It records the acquisition by &AElig;thelweard and &AElig;thelm&aelig;r of lands from (among others) &#145;kinsmen&#146; named Godwine and Bishop Brihthelm. In a will of <i>c</i>.970 &AElig;lfgifu made a bequest to an &AElig;thelweard who was probably her brother, and Ealdorman &AElig;lfheah's will of much the same date left land to a &#145;kinsman&#146; &AElig;thelweard. &AElig;lfgifu may be the lady whose marriage to King Eadwig was dissolved because of consanguinity. Ealdorman &AElig;lfhere, &AElig;lfheah's brother, is said by an early charter of Eadwig to be &#145;of the king's kin&#146;; he or &AElig;lfheah had a son named Godwine. Eadwig also promoted his &#145;dear relative&#146;, Brihthelm, to a bishopric. &AElig;thelweard may thus have been Eadwig's brother-in-law and have belonged to a branch of the dynasty that came to new prominence under his rule; he does give one of the few positive verdicts on Eadwig. But there is no proof that the will's &AElig;lfgifu was the former queen, and some reason to think that the &AElig;thelweard it favours was a thegn of increasing seniority in Edgar's councils, who remained a thegn when the chronicler became an ealdorman (probably 976, or <i>c</i>.973). If his kin were in one sense a casualty as much as a beneficiary of the success of Alfred's line, there is no hint of his own disaffection. His book simply rejoiced in his royal pedigree. As ealdorman he consistently witnessed the charters of Edward the Martyr and &AElig;thelred II; third or fourth in ranking until 990, top from then to 998, when he evidently died. In one of his last appearances, he is <i>occidentalium provinciarum dux</i> (&#145;ealdorman of the western provinces&#146;). He was an architect of the peace (linked to payment of danegeld) made by &AElig;thelred and Olaf Tryggvason (994?). His son led the &#145;western thegns&#146; in submission to the victorious Swein (1013). But Cnut's purge in effect destroyed the family: the homonymous grandson was killed in 1017, the grandson-in-law outlawed in 1020.<br>
<br>Although intended for an overseas reader, &AElig;thelweard's work survives only in one English manuscript. This was largely burnt in the Cottonian fire of 1731, but had been printed by Henry Savile in 1596. The only medieval author to use it was William of Malmesbury, and the manuscript could be the copy he saw. Aspects of the chronicle usually singled out are its eccentric Latin (which William set the fashion in deploring), and the impression it gives of access to a text of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> better in various ways than any now extant. Neither point may do justice to its author. His Latin, like his chronological and geographical excursions, is learned. He not merely knew Aldhelm; he could imitate his pursuit of exhibitionist neologism, literary variation, and poetic cadence. It is as if he were striving for a style suited to secular narrative, as Einhard had, but with Aldhelm, not Cicero and Suetonius, as his guide. The book is annalistic in structure, but is ordered in four books that make sense in terms of the story told. Many of its deviations from the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> arise from misreadings. But the written sources which must underlie such extra information as his unique and important account of the 890s need not have been restricted to an unusually well-stocked chronicle. He could be an independent (if not very detailed) source for the half-century before his own time; why should he not have researched further details for earlier centuries from whichever sources? What he omits (episcopal succession, other kingdoms, the apostasy of the second Christian West Saxon king) fits his professed intention to exalt his and Matilda's family. His is therefore a work not just of translation but of history, and it exhibits a pronounced intelligence.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelweard's exceptional literary commitment is confirmed by his regular appearance as patron of &AElig;lfric's <span class="italic">Homilies</span>, <span class="italic">Lives of Saints</span>, and biblical renditions. &AElig;thelm&aelig;r, co-dedicatee of <span class="italic">Lives of Saints</span>, founded both &AElig;lfric's abbeys of Cerne and Eynsham, making him abbot of the latter. &AElig;lfric wrote for other laymen but for none so much. An intriguing speculation arises from a gift by &AElig;thelm&aelig;r's son-in-law to an abbey that may be identified as his own foundation of Buckfast. It was a copy of Bede's <span class="italic">Apocalypse</span> and Augustine's <span class="italic">Adulterous Unions</span> (each a topical concern in England <i>c</i>.1000), and its later-tenth-century scribe also wrote the Exeter book of Old English verse. &AElig;thelweard can well be envisaged as the kind of man to relish literary celebration of aristocratic values in the era of <span class="italic">The Battle of Maldon</span>. In his family the cultures of scribe and warrior met. He may therefore be perceived in ways that have become familiar to Carolingian scholarship but have yet to strike chords in study of the Anglo-Saxons. His counterparts were the Carolingian nobles who were close (even related) to royalty and its ideologists, cultivated and devout, ministerially active, loyal at least until their position became intolerable, and victims as much as they were movers in the age's seismic politics.<br>
