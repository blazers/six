<span class="headword">Cave,  Sydney</span>  (1883&#150;1953), <span class="occ">Congregational minister, missionary, and theologian</span>, was born at 2 Park Place, Regent's Park, London, on 18 November 1883, the second of the five sons of William Cave (1843&#150;1910), a trunk maker, and his wife, Sarah (1851&#150;1939), who also had two daughters. He was a nephew of Dr Alfred Cave. Growing up in Fulham he was educated at St Mark's School, Chelsea, and the City of London School (1899&#150;1902), at both of which he won several prizes. In 1902 he entered Hackney College, a school of divinity of the University of London, to study under P. T. Forsyth who, according to a memoir, &#145;helped him find the cross in the centre of his thinking&#146;  (Jones, 454). He proved to be an outstanding student, gaining firsts in his BA and BD (honours) degrees, being awarded college scholarships, and becoming a Dr Williams's scholar. After four months' study in Germany he was ordained at Dawes Road Congregational Church, Fulham, on 8 October 1908.<br>
<br>Having offered for service with the London Missionary Society, Cave was appointed to India and stationed at Nagercoil, Travancore, where he served as acting principal of Scott Christian College (1909&#150;11 and 1916), and principal of Duthie Divinity College (1911&#150;15) training the local ministry.<br>
<br>Cave's fianc&eacute;e, Elizabeth Jane Baxter (1880&#150;1950), originally from Aberdeen, arrived in Madras in November 1909 and they were married there on 25 November. A daughter and son were born in India, and a second son in Bristol. Following their recurrent illnesses, doctors decided that the children could not live in India. They returned to England with Mrs Cave in 1914, but Sydney was not allowed to follow until his furlough, which was due in 1916. On 16 April 1918, having been inducted as minister of Henleaze Congregational Church, Bristol, he resigned from the society.<br>
<br>Although Cave's years in India were to influence all his subsequent work, his studies of Hindu thought found early expression in his thesis &#145;Redemption: Hindu and Christian&#146; for which in March 1917 he was awarded the DD degree (London).<br>
<br>In 1920 his scholarship and experience led to his appointment as president of Cheshunt College, Cambridge. Recognizing his academic ability, Cambridge University awarded him in 1925 an honorary MA, and he became a member of Emmanuel College. In 1949 he was select preacher before the university. The Cheshunt governors' report for 1922 records that the president &#145;has quickly proved his competence, being eagerly welcomed by the churches, commanding the complete confidence of the Governors and having gained the trust and affection of the students&#146;. Under his presidency the educational standard was raised, the curriculum widened, and many of his books were written.<br>
<br>In 1933 Cave became principal of New College, London, which had been formed in 1924 from the union of New and Hackney colleges. He held this position for the rest of his life, and it was here, in the building where he had once been a student, that full recognition came: the award by the University of Glasgow of an honorary DD (1934); professor of theology in the University of London (1936&#150;49) and emeritus professor until his death; chairman of the board of studies in theology (1938&#150;44); dean of the faculty (1944&#150;8); and member of the collegiate council (1937&#150;53).<br>
<br>In both Cambridge and London, Sydney Cave concentrated on his college work, serving the denomination in ways for which his position and experience peculiarly fitted him: director of the London Missionary Society from 1920, serving on the India and candidates' committees; member of the council of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, serving on the ministerial committee (sometimes as chairman) and the &#145;special&#146; committee (concerned with the recognition of ministers and churches); but consistently declining nomination as chairman of the union lest it interfere with his college work.<br>
<br>Cave's writings were on the doctrines of the Christian faith&#151;his last book, <span class="italic">The Christian Way</span> (1949), being an exploration of current ethical issues&#151;or on other religions and their relation to Christianity. His concern that all his students should be acquainted with the tenets of other faiths was then somewhat unusual but far sighted. His sensitive understanding of other religions also found expression in his Carew lectures at Hartford (1929) and Haskell lectures at Oberlin, Ohio (1939), the latter being published as <span class="italic">Hinduism or Christianity?</span>. Elsewhere, in works such as <span class="italic">The Doctrines of the Christian Faith</span> (1931), he demonstrated that although he regarded strict Calvinism as a &#145;hollow doctrine&#146; he also believed in the &#145;inadequacy&#146; of theological liberalism  (Jones, 454). He took the part of Nathaniel Micklem in the &#145;Blackheath controversy&#146; of 1933, after being provoked by accusations of having taught his students the rationalized Christianity promoted by the Blackheath group  (Grant, 329). In March 1939 he put his name to the manifesto drafted by Micklem and Bernard Manning, calling for a revival of faithfulness to the word of the gospel  (Jones, 455).<br>
<br>Sydney Cave was concerned to provide the church with well-educated, competent ministers. He sought no glory for himself, but his influence upon generations of students was of lasting importance. Colleagues sometimes found this shy man remote, but students found him approachable and sympathetic. In the post-war New College there were few rules, for he depended upon the Christian commitment of all. His slight stutter led him to adopt a steady tone when preaching, but his sense of the holiness and grace of God was inescapable.<br>
<br>After never having to miss giving a lecture, Cave was struck down by leukaemia in 1953, and died on 8 September at the Middlesex Hospital, London. He was cremated at Golders Green three days later. His wife had predeceased him, on 7 December 1950. The way he faced his last days confirmed his teaching.<br>
