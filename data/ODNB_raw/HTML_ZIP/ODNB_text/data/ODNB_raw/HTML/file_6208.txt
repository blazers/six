<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooper,  Anthony Ashley</span>, first earl of Shaftesbury  (1621&#150;1683), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born shortly after 3 a.m. on 22 July 1621 at the house of his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/757/', "Sir Anthony Ashley, baronet")</script>, in Wimborne St Giles, Dorset, &#145;the eldest child then living&#146;  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 2, p. xxv) of Sir John Cooper, baronet (<i>d</i>. 1631), of Rockbourne, Hampshire, and his wife, Anne Ashley (<i>d</i>. 1628), of Wimborne St Giles. He was baptized on 3 August and given both names of his maternal grandfather in fulfilment of a promise his parents had made to Sir Anthony. Anthony had a younger sister, Philippa (1623&#150;1701), and a younger brother, George (<i>b</i>. 1625), about whom little is known. His father, created a baronet in 1622, represented Poole in the parliaments of 1625 and 1628, supporting an attack on the Arminian tendencies of the bishop of Winchester, Richard Neile, in February 1629. Both his parents died while Anthony was still a child; his mother on 20 July 1628, his father on 23 March 1631.<br>
<br>Through birth and through his relatives' and his own marriages Cooper became connected to some of the most powerful families in England. The Coopers and the Ashleys were of minor gentry stock, but both families had steadily built up their landed possessions over the generations, and the marriage between John and Anne in 1616 united extensive neighbouring estates in Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire, as well as outlying properties in Somerset, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Middlesex. In 1622, two years after the death of his first wife, Sir Anthony Ashley, now aged seventy, married nineteen-year-old Philippa Sheldon, who was related to George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham, then the most powerful figure at court. In 1629 Sir John Cooper took as his second wife Mary, the widow of Sir Charles Moryson and one of the daughters of Sir Baptist Hicks, to whose great commercial fortune she was coheir. Mary's grandson from her first marriage was Arthur Capel, first earl of Essex. Cooper himself married three times over the course of his life. On 25 February 1639 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1649), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6483/', "Thomas Coventry, first Baron Coventry")</script>, Charles I's then lord keeper; she brought with her a dowry of &pound;4000; the marriage also connected him with George Savile, later first marquess of Halifax, whose father married Margaret's sister. Margaret was Cooper's own choice as bride, and he appears to have been genuinely in love with her. The marriage, however, brought no children. Margaret had two miscarriages (in 1646 and 1647) and gave birth to a stillborn girl in December 1647; she was seven and a half months into her fourth pregnancy when, on 10 July 1649, she &#145;fell suddenly into an apoplectical convulsion fit&#146; and died  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 2, p. lii). Cooper's second wife was Lady Frances Cecil (1633&#150;1652), eldest daughter of David Cecil, third earl of Exeter, whom he married on 15 April 1650 when she was still only seventeen. The couple had two sons: the first, Cecil, died in childhood; the second, Anthony Ashley, eventually became second earl of Shaftesbury. Frances died on 31 December 1652, aged only nineteen. On 30 August 1655 Cooper married Margaret (<i>bap</i>. 1627, <i>d</i>. 1693), sixth daughter of William Spencer, second Baron Spencer of Wormleighton, sister of the first earl of Sunderland (who had been killed at Newbury fighting for the king in 1643), and the niece of Thomas Wriothesley, fourth earl of Southampton; she also brought a dowry of &pound;4000. Although the marriage remained childless, it appears to have been happy.<h2>
<a name="Inheritanceandearlylife"></a>Inheritance and early life</h2>Cooper's inheritance was troubled. His father, as a result of heavy gambling and extravagant spending, had run up debts in excess of &pound;35,000. In addition most of his lands were held by knight service, which meant that his heir and estates would pass into the hands of the court of wards. Sir John's two trustees, Edward Tooker (who had married one of Sir John's sisters) and Sir Daniel Norton (a colleague of Sir John's in the Commons and the husband of Cooper's godmother), bought the wardship of the boy from the king for &pound;3000, but found themselves still under the authority of the court of wards when it came to selling land to meet Sir John's debts. Sir Francis Ashley, the younger brother of Sir Anthony, then the king's serjeant-at-law, persuaded the court to sell some of the richest parts of the estate, which enabled Sir Francis and two of the commissioners for the sales to pick up several properties at less than market value. Cooper later estimated his loss from what he called &#145;the injustice and oppression of that Court&#146; at &pound;20,000  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 1, p. viii). He was far from being reduced to poverty, however; a survey made in 1638 calculated that a yearly revenue of &pound;2349 15<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. from the lands remaining to him was improvable to over &pound;7000.<br>
<br>As he was growing up Cooper was exposed to a number of puritan influences. His first tutor was Aaron Guerdon, a noted puritan selected for him by his grandfather, who felt the youth &#145;could not have too deep a dye of religion&#146;  (Haley, 12). Following his father's death the young Sir Anthony Cooper, bt, as he now became, went to live at Southwick, near Portsmouth, with his father's trustee, Sir Daniel Norton, a man of puritan leanings who had joined the attack on Arminianism in the parliament of 1629. Here he was tutored by a man called Fletcher, about whom we know only that he was an excellent teacher of grammar. When Sir Daniel died in early 1636 Cooper joined the household of the other trustee, Edward Tooker, at Maddington, near Salisbury, where he was put into the care of a third tutor, an MA from Oriel College, Oxford, who left so little impression that later in life Shaftesbury was unable to remember his name. In March 1637 Cooper entered Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied under its rector, Dr John Prideaux, regius professor of divinity, a strong upholder of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination and another vehement opponent of Arminianism, before entering Lincoln's Inn on 18 February 1638, where he was exposed to the puritan preaching of Dr Edward Reynolds and Joseph Caryll.<br>
<br>Following his marriage to Lord Coventry's daughter in February 1639 Cooper, being still a minor and therefore not yet having come into possession of his property, moved into his father-in-law's household, and apart from occasional visits to Wimborne St Giles lived in the lord keeper's houses at Durham House in the Strand and at Canonbury in Islington. He inherited the short stature of his grandfather and as an adult was markedly below average height. He was also plagued by ill health, suffering from an internal condition which left him with a permanent dull aching pain on his left side, but which invariably flared up during the middle of the day to cause a bout of such intense pain that he was forced to lie down wherever he was. Portraits reveal a man with marked features, though by no means unattractive, and a face that shows character, composure, and intelligence. Although his education had been unsystematic he attained the educated gentleman's usual knowledge of the classics, history, and law.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareerandcivilwarpolitics16401650"></a>Early political career and civil war politics, 1640&#150;1650</h2>In March 1640 Cooper was chosen to serve as member for Tewkesbury for the Short Parliament (13 April&#150;5 May) when still a minor, thanks in part to the influence of the Coventrys, whose family seat was at nearby Croome D'Abitot in Worcestershire. However, he was not asked to stand for Tewkesbury again in October 1640 at the elections for what was to become the Long Parliament, the Coventry connection probably working to his disadvantage at a time when opinion in the county was hardening against those associated with the court. In December he contested the by-election for the borough of Downton in Wiltshire, but a double return was made, and although (according to Cooper's own account) the committee of privileges decided in his favour its report never came before the Commons. When civil war broke out in 1642 Cooper at first tried to avoid taking sides. Although he left London after the king's departure from Whitehall in January 1642 he did not join the court, instead making his way to Rufford, Nottinghamshire, to stay with his brother-in-law, Sir William Savile. He was present in the county when Charles I raised his standard at Nottingham on 22 August and rode from Rufford to Nottingham to see the king, though whether or not he actually witnessed the ceremony is unclear. He left with the king for Derby on 13 September, but &#145;only as a spectator&#146;, he later claimed in his autobiographical sketch, &#145;having not as yet adhered against the Parliament&#146;  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 2, p. xxvii); indeed, he did not accompany Charles beyond Derby, but instead retired northwards, away from the scene of military operations.<br>
<br>In spring 1643, however, with the expected speedy resolution to the conflict not having materialized, Cooper decided that he should return to Dorset, make his choice, and take part in the upcoming campaign. During that summer he threw in his lot with the royalists and at his own expense raised a regiment of foot and a troop of horse, of which he became a colonel and captain respectively. Nevertheless he hoped for a compromise settlement. According to a later memoir written by John Locke he went to see the king at Oxford and asked to be allowed to treat with the parliamentary garrisons, starting in his own county of Dorset, offering to restore things to &#145;the same posture they were before the war&#146; and promising a free parliament to &#145;do what more remained to be done for the settlement of the nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Locke</span>, 1812, 9.267). Cooper did begin some private negotiations for the surrender of Dorchester but had achieved nothing when the royalist victory at Roundway Down in mid-July, followed by the fall of Bristol, changed the military balance in the area. By 2 August royalist troops under the command of Lord Carnarvon were at the gates of Dorchester and Cooper was one of three royal commissioners appointed to treat with the town the next day. Dorchester surrendered without resistance in return for being spared plunder and punishment; Weymouth and Portland soon followed suit. However, the terms of the surrender were betrayed by Prince Maurice, whose troops arrived in the area shortly afterwards and immediately set about plundering both Dorchester and Weymouth. Carnarvon resigned his command in disgust, while Cooper and Maurice were said to have exchanged &#145;some pretty hot words&#146;  (ibid.). Maurice next tried to stop Cooper's appointment as governor of Weymouth and the Isle of Portland&#151;a commission promised him by Maurice's predecessor as commander of the royalist forces in the west, the marquess of Hertford&#151;on the grounds of inexperience. Cooper was able to persuade the chancellor of the exchequer, Edward Hyde (the future earl of Clarendon), to intercede with the king on his behalf, and in the end Charles agreed to confirm the commission; at the same time, however, the king wrote to Hertford to express concern over Cooper's youth and lack of military experience, urging the marquess to use his influence with Cooper to persuade him to resign as soon as he could without losing face. Cooper remained in the post for the rest of the year and was compensated with other honours, being made sheriff of Dorset and president of the council of war for that county. Locke's memoir claims that Cooper now made another attempt to bring the civil war to an end and framed a design to raise a third army of clubmen in several parts of the kingdom &#145;to suppress the armies on both sides&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Locke</span>, 1823, 9.268). Locke's account is problematic, however, since the clubmen movements did not emerge until 1645; moreover, there is no firm evidence to suggest that Cooper was involved in the formation of the clubmen in the west country at this later date.<br>
<br>Early in 1644 Cooper resigned all his commissions under the king and on 24 February presented himself at parliament's quarters at Hurst Castle. Clarendon alleged that it was pique at being forced to give up the governorship of Weymouth that led Cooper to quit the king's party, but this seems unlikely, since going over to parliament meant giving up the shrievalty and turning down an offer of a peerage (both of which were more prestigious honours than the governorship of a small port) as well as leaving the greater part of his estates in Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire behind enemy lines. In his autobiographical sketch penned in January 1646 Cooper claimed that he took this step because he saw that the king's aim was &#145;destructive to religion and the state&#146;  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 2, p. xxix); indeed, others left the royalist cause at this time, out of concern about the increasing Catholic influence at court, Charles's truce with the Catholic rebels in Ireland, and the general view at royalist headquarters that a settlement must be imposed by conquest. When examined before the committee of both kingdoms in London on 6 March 1644 as to his reasons for coming over Cooper said that he believed the royalist side had no intention of &#145;promoting or preserving .. the Protestant religion and the liberties of the kingdom&#146;; that he was &#145;fully satisfied &hellip; of the justness&#146; of parliament's proceedings; and that he was willing to take the solemn league and covenant, now the general test of loyalty following parliament's recent treaty with the Scots  (Christie, 1.50).<br>
<br>On 10 July 1644 the Commons gave Cooper permission to leave London and join the county committee for Dorset and on 3 August the Dorset committee granted him a commission to command a brigade of horse and foot in Dorset with the title of field marshal-general. His first action was in the taking of Wareham, which capitulated on 10 August. On the 14th both houses of parliament voted to add him to the committee for governing the army in Dorset, and on the 22nd the Commons agreed that he should be allowed to compound for his sequestrated estates by payment of a &pound;500 fine (though the fine was never paid and was later discharged by Oliver Cromwell). Back in Dorset, Cooper played an active role on the county committee, many of whose letters carry his signature first. On 25 October he was appointed commander-in-chief of a parliamentary force of 1500 men to oppose the royalist forces in the area under the command of Sir Lewis Dyve. He led the attack on the home of Sir John Strangways at Abbotsbury, west Dorset, in early November, went on to take Sturminster and Shaftesbury, and in December assisted in the relief of Colonel Robert Blake at Taunton. Taunton, however, was to be Cooper's last military action. Although a parliamentary committee sent him instructions in May 1645 to besiege Corfe Castle nothing ever came of this because the troops he was to use were occupied elsewhere. His military retirement may have had something to do with the new modelling of the army and the passage of the self-denying ordinance on 3 April 1645; although not a sitting MP Cooper still regarded himself as rightful member for Downton and may have thought it unwise to jeopardize his claim to the seat by retaining his commissions. Indeed, in autumn 1645 he did try to gain admission to parliament as member for Downton through his original petition, though the Commons resolved that &#145;no Person that hath been in actual War against this Parliament&#146; should &#145;be admitted to sit as a Member&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 4, 1644&#150;6, 260). Yet he may have been forced to cease military service because of ill health; in June and July 1645 he spent six weeks in Tonbridge with his wife where &#145;he drank the waters&#146;, and in February 1646 he underwent two minor surgical procedures&#151;having &#145;a nerve and vein cut&#146; on both occasions  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 2, pp. xxxi, xxxiii)&#151;which left him confined to his chamber for several days.<br>
<br>Cooper nevertheless continued to serve in local office. In October 1645 he resumed his place on the Dorset county committee, often serving as chairman. In December the committee sent him to Ottery St Mary, Devon, to ask the general of the parliamentary army, Sir Thomas Fairfax, for troops to assist in the besieging of Corfe Castle; Cooper's role, however, was exclusively civil, and he was not present when Corfe Castle finally surrendered in April 1646. In December 1646, after the end of the first civil war, parliament appointed Cooper high sheriff for Wiltshire, a post he held until 11 February 1648, when he was replaced by his uncle, possibly for reasons of ill health. In July parliament made him one of the commissioners for the militia in Dorset and also a commissioner for the rate for Ireland for Dorset.<br>
<br>It was towards the end of the first civil war that Cooper began his investments in commerce and overseas plantations. On 23 March 1646 he records in his diary signing &#145;articles concerning my plantation in Barbadoes&#146;  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 2, p. xxxiv), while at the beginning of the next month he notes that two local boys bound themselves to him to serve there for seven years. Cooper had a joint share in a plantation of 205 acres, which employed twenty-one white servants and nine adult black slaves. Investments in the sugar plantations led him to acquire a quarter share in a small slave ship, the <i>Rose</i>, which was involved in the triangular trade between England, Guinea, and the West Indies. He sold his share of the Barbados plantation (105 acres) in 1655 for &pound;1020.<br>
<br>Unfortunately Cooper's diary, which runs from 1646 to 1650, remains silent on the great political issues of these years. It is normally thought that his sympathies lay with the presbyterians, though this needs qualification. He was not a religious presbyterian; he never advocated a policy of rigid conformity, and retained throughout his life a distaste for ecclesiastical authority. In his youth he had been friends with the noted puritan preacher William Strong, who was presented to a living near Wimborne in 1640 and who after the first civil war was to gather an Independent congregation which met in Westminster Abbey. Later in life Cooper was to have as his chaplain the Scottish Independent divine Robert Ferguson. He appears to have supported the cause of the political presbyterians in parliament against the army officers in 1647&#150;8, but he nevertheless showed himself willing to serve the Commonwealth at the local level after the regicide in January 1649. Thus in February 1649 the new regime made him a JP of the quorum for the counties of Wiltshire and Dorset and of oyer and terminer for the western circuit (though he was not actually sworn in until 16 August, perhaps hinting at some initial qualms about serving). In April he was appointed commissioner to regulate the contribution paid by the counties of Wiltshire and Dorset, and in January and February 1650 he not only subscribed the engagement of loyalty to the new regime but agreed to serve on a commission tendering the engagement to others.<h2>
<a name="Interregnumcareer16521660"></a>Interregnum career, 1652&#150;1660</h2>No more is heard of Cooper until 17 January 1652, when the Rump Parliament named him to an extra-parliamentary commission of twenty-one, headed by Sir Matthew Hale, for the reform of the law. The Hale commission, which was dominated by moderates, made a series of well-reasoned proposals for law reform designed mainly to appeal to the middle ground, although none of them was to be implemented. On 17 March 1653 the Rump pardoned Cooper &#145;of all Delinquency&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 7, 1651&#150;9, 268), thereby opening the door for him to sit in parliament. Cromwell dissolved the Rump on 20 April, but Cooper was nominated to serve in the Barebones Parliament which assembled on 4 July, where he sat for the county of Wiltshire. He was made a member of the council of state on 14 July and appointed to a number of important committees, including the committee &#145;for the business of the law&#146;, which was intended to pick up where the Hale commission had left off, and he was among those present at a conference with the envoys of the United Provinces on 21 July when Cromwell put forward proposals for a close union between the two commonwealths. He firmly aligned himself with the moderates in the assembly, voting against abolishing tithes before an alternative maintenance had been worked out (15 July) and opposing the passage of a further bill for the sale of delinquents' estates (30 August). On 27 August he reported from the council of state to parliament on the case of the former Leveller John Lilburne, who had been banished by the Rump under pain of death, but who had since returned to England where he had been found &#145;Not Guilty of any crime worthy of death&#146; by an Old Bailey jury who had taken it upon themselves &#145;to be Judges of matter of law, as well as matter of fact&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.446&#150;7). Cooper made no recommendation as to what to do with Lilburne, though parliament decided that Lilburne should continue in prison. Cooper was re-elected to the council of state when the time arrived to renew the body at the beginning of November, and supported a committee recommendation that tithes be continued when the issue again came before the assembly on 3 December. When the assembly voted on 10 December, by a majority of just two, to reject the committee's recommendation he joined with those who decided to turn up early on the morning of Monday 12 December 1653 to vote their own dissolution.<br>
<br>Within four days a new constitution, the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;, establishing Cromwell as lord protector, was installed, and under its terms Cooper was named as one of fifteen members of the new council of state (though he never received his allotted salary of &pound;1000 per annum). He was thus a member of the council which, in March 1654, approved the removal of John Lilburne to Jersey, where the writ of habeas corpus would not run: a loophole in the law which ironically was to be stopped by the so-called <span class="roman">Shaftesbury Act</span> of 1679. In the elections to the first protectorate parliament in summer 1654 he was chosen by three constituencies&#151;Wiltshire, Poole, and Tewkesbury&#151;opting to sit for the more prestigious county seat, where he had emerged victorious after a fierce partisan contest. Under the new constitution Wiltshire had ten MPs, and the election that July came to be disputed between two rival slates of ten candidates: one a group of determined republicans, headed by Edmund Ludlow; the other a mixture of Cromwellian partisans, presbyterians, and erstwhile cavaliers, headed by Cooper. So many voters showed up on election day that the poll had to be switched from Wilton to Stonehenge. There Cooper urged the electorate to choose &#145;such as were of healing spirits&#146;, not those who &#145;were for putting of all things into confusion and disorder&#146;  (Firth, 1.388&#150;9), and the under-sheriff eventually declared his slate elected, though Ludlow alleged electoral malpractice and claimed that his own party were in the majority.<br>
<br>The first protectorate parliament spent much of its existence debating the detailed terms of the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;, though unfortunately the records do not provide much insight into where Cooper stood on the issues involved. On 27 November 1654 he was one of the tellers against a motion for restoring the old 40<i>s</i>. freehold county franchise, which the instrument had replaced by a voting qualification of &pound;200 worth of real or movable property. On 23 December he supported a proposal that Cromwell should be offered the title of king, as part of a last-ditch effort to prevent the protector from breaking with his parliament and ruling through a standing army; however, it failed to generate much interest and was not even pressed to a division. Shortly afterwards Cooper broke with Cromwell. He attended the council for the last time on 28 December and was not present when it next met, on 5 January 1655. That same day parliament voted an entirely inadequate sum for the army, and a few days later Cooper moved a resolution to make illegal the collection or payment of revenue not authorized by parliamentary grant. Cromwell dissolved the parliament on 22 January. Ludlow alleged that Cooper moved into opposition because Cromwell refused to let him marry his daughter, Mary, but there is no contemporary corroboration for this. Instead Cooper's change of sides was probably motivated by a genuine concern about political developments under the protectorate.<br>
<br>The exiled Charles II thought that Cooper had turned royalist, and on 26 February 1655 wrote offering forgiveness and reward if he would help secure a restoration. Cooper did not reply and remained aloof when Colonel Penruddock launched his royalist rising in the west country in March 1655. Elected to serve for Wiltshire in the second protectorate parliament (which met on 17 September 1656), he was among about one hundred members whom the council of state refused to allow to sit, and together with sixty-four similarly excluded members he signed a letter of protest to the speaker, which was delivered by the presbyterian Sir George Booth. His was also one of ninety-eight names appended to a printed remonstrance against Cromwell that appeared a few days later, accusing the protector of having &#145;assumed an absolute arbitrary sovereignty&#146; and charging anyone who approved of the exclusion with being a &#145;Capital enemy to the Commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">To All the Worthy Gentlemen</span>), though the work appears to have been written by a disgruntled Commonwealth man, who affixed the names of the excluded members without authority. Cooper finally took his seat on 20 January 1658, following Cromwell's acceptance of a revised version of the <span class="italic">Humble Petition and Advice</span> (which stipulated that the excluded members should be allowed to return), and took the oath of fidelity to the protector as chief magistrate of the Commonwealth. That same month Cromwell discharged the fine of &pound;500 imposed on Cooper by the Long Parliament for delinquency. Cooper joined with the opposition to the &#145;other house&#146; which had been created by the petition and advice, and a frustrated Cromwell dissolved this parliament on 4 February.<br>
<br>Nothing more is heard of Cooper until the calling of Richard Cromwell's parliament in early 1659, which was elected according to the old system of county and borough representation for English members, though still with the new Scottish and Irish members provided for by the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;. Cooper was returned for both Wiltshire and Poole, but as before chose to sit for the former. The house spent most of its time debating the validity of the existing constitution, where Cooper sided with the republicans, challenging the <span class="italic">Humble Petition and Advice</span> and insisting that the bill to recognize Richard Cromwell should contain additional clauses limiting the powers of the protector, particularly with regard to the key issues of control over the militia and the negative voice. Although the house agreed that before the <span class="roman">Bill of Recognition</span> was committed it could declare additional clauses binding the protector's power to be part of the bill, the Cromwellians managed to deflect the issue by insisting that the position of the &#145;other house&#146; be settled first. The house agreed that it should be part of the <span class="roman">Bill of Recognition</span> to declare that parliament was to consist of two houses, but fell into endless debates about the composition and powers of the &#145;other house&#146;. Cooper wanted the question of whether the second chamber should consist of the old lords or the new ones nominated by Oliver Cromwell determined first (making clear his own hostility to the new lords), though some of the opposition thought it better to impose bounds on the &#145;other house&#146; before settling the question of membership. As a way through the impasse supporters of the government proposed that the house should transact with the &#145;other house&#146; as a house of parliament, with the proviso that this should not &#145;exclude the rights of the old peers that have been faithful&#146;. In a speech on 7 March Cooper condemned this as a trick, for by pretending to safeguard the rights of the old peers it in reality destroyed their claim to constitute the upper house. The house then turned to debating the right of the Scottish and Irish members to sit. In discussing the Scots, Cooper insisted he was &#145;as much for the Union as any man&#146; and would have the Scots &#145;have as fair a legislature as may be&#146;, but objected to the way in which they were brought in &#145;upon the interest of the Chief Magistrate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 4.189). Those who wanted the Scottish and Irish members to continue to sit, however, carried the day. On 28 March the house returned to the question of whether it should transact with the &#145;other house&#146;. Again Cooper condemned the idea, alleging that if they gave &#145;this other House&#146; the right of veto over business transacted in the Commons it would effectively give the protector &#145;a whole negative&#146; to block whatever proceedings he did not like  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 4.284). In the end the &#145;other house&#146; was recognized, though only for the duration of the existing parliament. Cooper also opposed a bill purporting to end the excise and customs duties after the protector's death, which was a thinly veiled attempt to confirm the protector's right to levy these for life, urging members not to settle the revenue before they knew what their money would go to support. The debate was adjourned, but never resumed, and the bill failed.<br>
<br>Richard Cromwell dissolved parliament on 22 April 1659, and the Rump Parliament, which had been forcibly dissolved by Oliver Cromwell in 1653, was restored on 7 May (Richard Cromwell resigned as protector on 24 May). Cooper again tried to revive his claim to sit for Downton, the matter being referred to a committee which never reported. He was, however, appointed to the council of state on 19 May as one of the ten non-members in an executive body of thirty-one. Some of the republicans on the council objected to his sitting, suspecting him of royalist sympathies; to allay any suspicion he asked to be tendered the oath of loyalty to the Commonwealth &#145;without a single person, kingship or house of peers&#146;  (Haley, 113). That same month he rejected a second personal advance from Charles II. He sat on the council until 11 July, when he returned to Wimborne to attend to his estates. In August he was arrested on suspicion of complicity in Sir George Booth's unsuccessful presbyterian royalist uprising in Cheshire&#151;Booth was a known friend and was reported to have been in correspondence with Cooper&#151;but on 14 September the council found him not guilty of any involvement.<br>
<br>Thus exonerated, Cooper resumed his seat on the council, but he opposed the army's suspension of the Rump on 13 October 1659 and stopped attending the council of state two days later. When the army replaced the council of state with its own committee of safety on the 25th he threw in his lot with the republicans Thomas Scott, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, Henry Neville, and five others who continued to meet secretly as the rightful council of state. On 9 November he and Scott unsuccessfully tried to induce London's common council to petition for the restoration of the Rump. The secret council now came to see General George Monck, commander of the forces in Scotland, as their main hope. On 16 November Cooper and Hesilrige met three of Monck's commissioners in London and urged that Monck should declare for the recall of the Rump, claiming that he would have the support of all the inferior officers and common soldiers stationed near London. That same day appeared a printed remonstrance, with Cooper's one of the 450 names appended, protesting against the interruption of the parliament by the army and calling for the restoration of the Rump &#145;and the settlement of this Nation upon the constant succession of Parliaments&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Remonstrance</span>, 3). While waiting for Monck the secret council secured the support of the garrison of Portsmouth (3 December), commanded by Cooper's long-term friend Colonel Whetham, and Cooper was given a commission to command all the forces in London expected to join the revolt against the committee of safety. He was arrested on suspicion of planning to raise the counties of Wiltshire and Dorset, but since his plot involved London and not the west country, he was truthfully able to deny all such allegations and was released after giving his word not to leave London without permission. He now slipped into hiding in the City, where he and his colleagues launched a conspiracy to seize the Tower of London, with the help of the lieutenant of the Tower, Colonel Fitch, on 12 December. Tipped off in advance, the committee of safety had Fitch arrested and the plot came to nothing, but Cooper, Scott, and others wrote an open letter to General Charles Fleetwood, commander-in-chief of the army, on 16 December defending the attempt and insisting that the Rump was the only authority which could &#145;be hoped to make the sword subservient to the civil interest, and settle the government in the hands of the people by successive and free parliaments unlawfully denied to them&#146;  (Christie, vol. 1, appx 5, p. lxxvii).<br>
<br>Developments were soon to play into Cooper's and his allies' hands. With the fleet under Admiral Lawson having already declared for the Rump, on 23 December troops assembled at Lincoln's Inn Fields and resolved to stand by parliament and follow the orders of the council of state. The Rump reassembled on 26 December and appointed Cooper one of the seven commissioners to have temporary control over the armed forces (until Hesilrige returned on the 28th) and one of the three to have temporary control of the Tower (until his friend Colonel Morley was made lieutenant on 7 January 1660). On 2 January Cooper was one of the ten non-members voted to a new council of state; three days later a committee was set up to report on the disputed Downton election, and on 7 January he was finally allowed to take his seat in the Long Parliament, some nineteen years after his original election. On his admission to the house he took the engagement of 1649 to be faithful to the Commonwealth. When an additional clause was put to the council of state renouncing Charles Stuart he declined to take it, but so did the majority of the council, including impeccable republicans like Colonel Hutchinson; he still made no attempt to engage in correspondence with the exiled court, and in mid-January Hyde wondered whether Cooper would &#145;ever serve the King&#146;  (Ogle, 4.517). Nevertheless Cooper had begun to break company with his former republican allies, and according to the royalist agent John Mordaunt, the Rump became divided into two irreconcilable parties, one headed by Cooper, the other by Henry Neville. When the Rump set about remodelling the army regiments to remove officers who had supported the committee of safety they gave Cooper Fleetwood's regiment (18 January), which he proceeded to fill &#145;with officers for his turn&#146;  (Firth, 2.206). With Monck now on his march south from Scotland, Hesilrige and Scott offered Cooper command of the army to march against him, but he refused, saying he had given Monck his &#145;word to be his friend, and therefore could not break it&#146;  (Christie, 1.205). Upon Monck's arrival in London, Hesilrige and his supporters on the council of state, in an attempt to ruin Monck's credit, urged the general to punish the City for recent disturbances and for threatening to withhold taxes until there was a free parliament by dismantling the gates and arresting eleven prominent citizens. Cooper made a desperate effort to dissuade Monck from taking such action, though in vain. Having dutifully carried out his commands on 10 February, Monck then learned that the Rump, instead of confirming him as commander-in-chief as promised, had decided to appoint five commissioners to control the army. Cooper, together with Lady Monck and some other friends, now convinced the general of the need to &#145;take some vigorous course&#146; if he was to prevent his ruin  (Christie, 1.208). On 11 February Monck marched with his own troops into the City and sent the Rump a letter reminding them that his army had undertaken not only to restore the parliament but also to vindicate the people's liberties and demanding that writs be issued out within a week to fill all the vacant seats. When the Rump decided to place restrictions on who should be allowed to stand Cooper urged Monck to restore the secluded members. This was done on 21 February with Cooper, as colonel of Fleetwood's regiment, commanding the escort. Two days later parliament appointed Cooper to a new council of state which consisted entirely of presbyterians and others who had played no part in the regicide and were not committed to a republic. The Long Parliament finally voted its own dissolution on 16 March 1660.<br>
<br>It was only now that Cooper began to draw closer to the royalist cause; in late February Lady Willoughby reported to Hyde that Cooper was a &#145;firm friend to the King&#146;, and a letter from Charles II to Cooper in mid-March about procuring the &#145;peace and happiness of the nation&#146; this time received a &#145;civil&#146; response  (Ogle, 4.573, 600, 660). Cooper may initially have favoured a conditional restoration, since in mid-April he attended a meeting of the &#145;presbyterian knot&#146; at Sussex House, who were pressing for a settlement along the lines of the treaty of Newport negotiated with Charles I in 1648. However, as MP for Wiltshire in the Convention Parliament, which met on 25 April, he decided to acknowledge an unconditional restoration, and was one of twelve voted by the Commons on 8 May to go to The Hague to invite Charles II to return.<h2>
<a name="TheRestorationandtheClarendonadministration16601667"></a>The Restoration and the Clarendon administration, 1660&#150;1667</h2>Cooper accompanied Charles II on his triumphal return to England in late May and was among those who received a special recommendation from Monck for a place on the privy council. Further support for his appointment came from the incoming treasurer, the earl of Southampton, who was thought to be more than capable of keeping his nephew by marriage on the path of loyalty. Thus at Canterbury on 27 May Charles named Cooper to his new privy council; two days later he appeared at the head of his regiment of cavalry at Blackheath, where the army assembled to welcome Charles back into the capital. He availed himself of the free pardon offered by Charles's declaration of Breda of 4 April, and received a formal pardon on 27 June. He was granted further pardons under the great seal on 10 February and 8 June 1661.<br>
<br>Although not one of the inner ring of the privy council, known as the committee on foreign affairs, as a member of the Convention Cooper acted as an important spokesman for the government. On 4 July he helped defeat a motion that those who served under the protectorate should refund their salaries&#151;&#145;he might freely speak&#146;, he said, &#145;because he never received any&#146;&#151;claiming that the proviso was &#145;dangerous to the peace of the nation&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4.78) and pointing out that it reached important members of the new royal administration, such as General Monck and Admiral Montagu. On 16 July he successfully argued for a postponement of the discussion of a bill to settle religion, the government wanting to address what in its view were more urgent matters first. In the debates over the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span> (passed 29 August), which was to decide who should be exempted from the general pardon, Cooper urged lenity. He saved Hesilrige's life, arguing that only those who had been guilty of shedding Charles I's blood should be punished; he also signed a certificate in favour of Colonel Hutchinson, another former republican colleague, and spoke in favour of the regicide Colonel George Fleetwood. As a member of the special commission for the trial of the regicides excluded from the general amnesty, however, he took part in the sentencing to death of a number of former colleagues and associates: Hugh Peters, who had served with him on the law reform commission of 1652&#150;3; Major-General Harrison, who had sat with him on the council of state in 1653; and Thomas Scott, an ally in the revived Rump of 1659 and one who towards the end of that year had joined with him in the conspiracy to seize the Tower. In November he spoke out against the revival of the court of wards (abolished by the Long Parliament in 1641), at whose expense he had suffered in his youth, and supported the continuance of the Long Parliament's excise duties to compensate the crown for loss of revenue from former rights of wardship. As a privy councillor he served on numerous committees, including the committee to deal with the plantations and the council for trade, being one of the government's hardest workers. His reward came on 20 April 1661, when in the coronation honours Charles II created him Baron Ashley of Wimborne St Giles. He took his seat in the Lords on 11 May and two days later he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer and under-treasurer (probably owing the latter appointment to the influence of his uncle Southampton).<br>
<br>Some biographers have claimed that Ashley vehemently opposed the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span> (passed 19 December 1661), which restricted municipal offices to Anglicans, but there is no firm evidence to support this; he was not even present at the decisive conference between the Lords and Commons on the act on the 19th. Indeed, at this stage he appears to have supported the government's desire for greater control over the towns, remarking at one Lords committee meeting in early February 1662 that &#145;the greatness of corporations&#146; was &#145;inconvenient to monarchy&#146;  (Seaward, 151). Nor did he intervene in the debates over the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> (passed May 1662), and when the Lords debated the Commons' amendments making the act more stringent he was not recorded as being present. He did, however, support efforts to alleviate the plight of dissenters. He was a member of a Lords committee in July 1662 that tried to insert a clause into a bill allowing for late subscription to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> that would have made it possible for moderate dissenters to conform, though the amendment was rejected by the Commons. He joined Sir Henry Bennet, the earl of Bristol, and Lord Robartes in advising Charles to issue his first declaration of indulgence on 26 December 1662 in favour of peaceable nonconformists and loyal Catholics, and when parliament made Charles withdraw the indulgence in February 1663, denying the legality of the dispensing power on which it was based, he supported Robartes's efforts to introduce a bill to allow the king to dispense protestant nonconformists (though not Catholics) from the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. In the face of opposition to the <span class="roman">Dispensing Bill</span> from Lord Chancellor Clarendon, Ashley proclaimed in the Lords on 12 March how unfortunate the king was that &#145;the great Officers of the Crown&#146; should oppose &#145;such a Prerogative&#146; (the dispensing power) as perhaps &#145;would be found to be inherent in him without any Declaration of Parliament&#146;, adding that he wondered why they would not trust the king  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 2.471). Clarendon, stung by the attack, described the bill as &#145;Ship-Money in Religion, that Nobody could know the End of&#146;  (ibid., 2.473). The bill was dropped in committee, but Clarendon's outspoken remarks cost him favour with the king.<br>
<br>Ashley had not always seen eye to eye with the lord chancellor since the Restoration. In 1661&#150;2 he had joined with Bristol in opposing Charles's proposed marriage to Catherine of Braganza and the consequent commercial treaty with Portugal, which had been backed by Clarendon, because the match brought England into the French orbit, implying, as it did, support for the Portuguese in their struggle for independence from France's rival Spain. Following the clash over the <span class="roman">Dispensing Bill</span> Ashley seemed to be the rising star at court: in April 1663 the French ambassador observed how Ashley was &#145;perfectly in the King's graces&#146; and predicted that he, Bristol, Bennet, and &#145;the rest of that clique&#146; might &#145;well give trouble to the Chancellor&#146;  (Christie, 1.272). Ashley still retained some connections with the chancellor. For example, on 24 March 1663 the two men were among the eight named as joint proprietors of the projected colony of Carolina. Nor did Ashley support Bristol's rash attempt to impeach Clarendon in July. Nevertheless he continued to be associated with the chancellor's reputed enemies: it was during this time that he first struck up a political association with the earl of Lauderdale, and by early 1664 Ashley was firmly identified as part of Lauderdale's anti-Clarendonian Cabal.<br>
<br>Ashley's sympathy for dissent led him to try to soften the impact of the <span class="roman">Conventicle Bill</span> which came before the Lords on 28 April 1664 and he was a member of a Lords subcommittee that managed to mitigate the harshness of the penalties originally suggested by the Commons. On 24 December, following the outbreak of renewed hostilities with the Dutch, he was appointed treasurer of the prize commission, accountable to the king alone; Clarendon, jealous of Ashley's growing influence, objected to the bypassing of the normal exchequer routine, but was forced to back down. Clarendon remained confident &#145;that few men &hellip; had a worse Opinion of [Ashley's] Integrity&#146; than Charles himself  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 2.466); on the surface, however, Ashley seemed genuinely in the royal favour. Indeed, on 10 August 1665 Charles did him the honour of a surprise visit to his house at Wimborne, and a couple of weeks later both the king and queen were entertained there. It was now that Ashley met the king's teenage illegitimate son, James, duke of Monmouth, for the first time.<br>
<br>In the brief parliamentary session of October 1665, held at Oxford because of the plague, Ashley unsuccessfully opposed Sir George Downing's appropriation proviso to the <span class="roman">Subsidy Bill</span>, restricting the use of the money thus raised to the sole purpose of carrying on the Dutch war, on the grounds that the precedent, once set, might deprive ministers of any flexibility over how to use the money received from parliamentary taxation. According to his own, later account, he also supported his uncle Southampton's attempt to block the passage of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span>, which forbade ejected nonconformist ministers from coming within 5 miles of any town or their former parish, though the records of the Lords do not list him as among the bill's opponents. When Ashley returned to Oxford in June 1666, seeking relief from his internal abscess by drinking the local spa water, he chanced to make the acquaintance of John Locke, beginning what turned out to be a lifelong friendship. When Ashley took up residence in Exeter House, off the Strand in London, in spring 1667, he invited Locke to live in his household.<br>
<br>In the parliamentary session of 1666&#150;7 Ashley joined the duke of Buckingham in supporting the passage of the <span class="roman">Irish Cattle Bill</span>, designed to prevent the importation into England of Irish fat cattle. As a landowner he was concerned about the effect the Irish imports were having on cattle breeders in his native south-west, but he also used the occasion to strike out at the lord lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, duke of Ormond&#151;either from a personal antipathy to Ormond, a jealousy that Irish peers might rise above English ones, or as a subterfuge to attack the high-church party at court (of which Ormond was one). He followed this up by proposing in the committee of privileges that Irish peers should lose any right to precedence over English commoners, and was rumoured to be preparing a bill to alter the Irish book of rates so as to force Ireland to import foreign commodities only through England. The <span class="roman">Irish Cattle Bill</span> passed the Lords on 23 November 1663 by a vote of sixty-three votes to forty-seven (noticeably all the bishops voted against it), but the matter did not rest there, since the Lords had replaced the word &#145;nuisance&#146; in the bill, which would have prevented the king from granting dispensations from it, with the legally more innocuous words &#145;detriment and mischief&#146;. The Commons refused to accept this, and were supported by a minority of peers, including Ashley and Buckingham, who argued that it did not take away from the royal prerogative to make laws indispensable, since most laws made for the king's benefit were, such as the laws against treason. In the end the word &#145;nuisance&#146; was reinserted and the bill became law on 14 January 1667.<br>
<br>The dispute over the <span class="roman">Irish Cattle Bill</span> represents the first time that Ashley stood on the same side as a discontented majority in the Commons against the court interest. As such it temporarily cost him royal favour. When the treasurer, Southampton, died in May 1667, Charles, instead of appointing Ashley, who was under-treasurer, as his successor, put the Treasury into commission; he did, under protest, name Ashley as one of the commissioners, though not as one of the quorum. Following the failures of the Dutch war Clarendon himself was now in trouble, and was stripped of the chancellorship on 31 August. Yet despite having been at odds with the former chief minister on many issues for several years Ashley did not seek to reingratiate himself with the king by supporting the attempted impeachment of Clarendon in November, which was backed by Charles himself and pressed in the Lords by Ashley's former political allies Buckingham, Bristol, and Bennet (now earl of Arlington). Indeed, he successfully opposed a motion to commit Clarendon to the Tower on a general charge of treason, arguing that he could not be committed unless detailed charges were brought.<h2>
<a name="TheadministrationoftheCabal16681673"></a>The administration of the Cabal, 1668&#150;1673</h2>The administration that succeeded Clarendon's is normally referred to as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93697', "Cabal")</script>, following the initial letters of the ministers who signed the phoney treaty of Dover of 1670&#151;Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale. In fact, the five never formed a coherent ministerial team. Initially Arlington and Buckingham ran the government, though there were rivalries between the two. Ashley was out of favour following Clarendon's fall, and it was some time before he obtained a leading place in the king's councils; although he continued as chancellor of the exchequer and a commissioner of the Treasury, he had still not been placed on the king's inner cabinet, the so-called committee of foreign affairs. The fall of Clarendon suggested that the time might be right to modify the religious settlement erected at the Restoration, and Ashley joined with Buckingham, Arlington, and the latitudinarian Bishop Wilkins of Chester to persuade Charles to endorse schemes for the comprehension of more moderate dissenters within the established church; two government-backed comprehension bills were drafted in October 1667 and February 1668, though they came to nothing. However, in May 1668 Ashley fell desperately ill. From the detailed notes kept by John Locke it appears that Ashley was suffering from a hydatid cyst of the liver, which now ruptured. (The condition is caused by a parasite transmitted through dogs or sheep.) Locke advised an operation, which was performed by a surgeon named Knollys on 12 June and undoubtedly saved Ashley's life. More dubiously it was decided that the tube which had been inserted during the operation to drain fluid from the abscess should remain permanently there, to allow for possible further drainage: hence later tory pamphleteers christened Shaftesbury &#145;Tapski&#146;, an allusion to the copper tap affixed to the end of the tube (the Polish ending because tories accused Shaftesbury of wanting to make England an elective monarchy like Poland).<br>
<br>It was at this time that Ashley resumed his interest in colonial affairs. Back in July 1660 he had been placed on the privy council's standing committee on trade and plantations, and later that year had helped set up the council of trade and council for foreign plantations, though these latter two bodies rapidly became moribund. When the standing committees of the privy council were reorganized in January 1668 Ashley was again placed on the committee for trade and plantations and, once he had recovered from his operation, was influential in resuscitating the council of trade, which received its commission in October. He became an <i>ex officio</i> member of the revived council for foreign plantations, set up on 30 July 1670, and president of the council of trade and foreign plantations when the two councils were merged in September 1672 (he continued to serve until April 1676, when the council was superseded by a committee of the privy council). He invested in the Hudson's Bay Company (chartered 1670), being appointed its deputy governor on 24 November 1674, and was instrumental in setting up the Bahama Adventurers' Company in autumn 1672. His darling, however, remained Carolina, and in 1669 he helped draw up the fundamental constitutions of Carolina, a copy of which in Locke's hand is preserved among the Shaftesbury papers.<br>
<br>On the domestic front Ashley joined Arlington and Buckingham in supporting the proposal for a political union with Scotland in 1669 and was at last admitted to a meeting of the committee of foreign affairs that June to discuss the terms, which he had had a hand in drawing up. Some progress was made over the next year, but when the Scots refused to consider a reduction in their existing parliamentary representation in any combined parliament the scheme was dropped. Despite Ashley's sympathy for the plight of dissenters he did not join with those peers who signed a formal protest against the passage of the 1670 <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, though he probably supported the amendments by which the Lords reduced the penalties the Commons wanted to impose for attendance at nonconformist conventicles.<br>
<br>By now the question of the succession had already begun to occupy people's minds. Catherine of Braganza remained childless and the heir to the throne was therefore still Charles's brother, the duke of York, whose Catholicism was already suspected. Following the fall of Clarendon, Ashley joined Buckingham and the earl of Carlisle in trying to persuade Charles to declare his eldest illegitimate child, James, duke of Monmouth, legitimate. When that failed, attention turned to trying to persuade Charles to divorce his wife and remarry. Hence the significance of the <span class="roman">Roos Remarriage Bill</span>, which came before the Lords in March 1670. Lord Roos had already obtained a divorce in the ecclesiastical court and his children had been declared illegitimate by parliament, but he was now seeking an act to allow him to remarry; if parliament could establish its competence to pass such an act the implications for a potential royal divorce were obvious. In the debate in the Lords on 28 March Ashley spoke strongly in favour of the bill, taking the line that marriage was a civil contract, not a sacrament, and therefore should be managed by the civil magistrate. The measure passed, though Charles was never to avail himself of the precedent.<br>
<br>Ashley was kept out of the negotiations for the secret treaty of Dover, signed on 22 May 1670, whereby in return for French subsidies Charles promised to announce his own conversion to Catholicism and join with France in an attack against the Dutch republic. Since preparations for war could hardly be kept secret, a mock treaty (<i>trait&eacute; simul&eacute;</i>) was concluded for the benefit of Ashley, Buckingham, and Lauderdale, omitting the so-called Catholic clauses (of which only Arlington and Clifford among the Cabal had any knowledge). Ashley had reservations about a French alliance (he had initially asked for time to think it over), but he was also concerned about Dutch commercial competition, and when in July, as one of the royal commissioners appointed to discuss a projected treaty on overseas trade with the Dutch ambassador, it became obvious to him that any concessions from the Dutch in the East Indies or elsewhere could only be won by force, he fell in with the plan. The <i>trait&eacute; simul&eacute;</i> was signed by the five members of the Cabal on 21 December; Ashley, Buckingham, and Lauderdale, however, insisted on adding a number of Dutch territories to the English share of the spoils, to ensure future English control of the mouths of the Scheldt and Rhine, much more than the French had initially bargained for.<br>
<br>In 1671 Ashley was one of the peers who pressed for a reduction of the duty on sugar imposed by the Commons' <span class="roman">Supply Bill</span>, fearing that the new rate would have an adverse effect on colonial sugar planters. The Commons objected to the Lords' attempt to interfere in a money bill, and the bill was lost when the king prorogued parliament on 22 April. That September Ashley and Clifford were together responsible for a momentous change in the administration of the customs when they proposed abandoning the traditional practice of employing customs farmers and suggested that the revenue should be collected by the king's own commissioners instead. The change was well received by London merchants and eventually redounded to the king's profit. In the short term, however, Charles was desperately short of money to fight the Dutch war. The government therefore decided upon the stop of the exchequer in January 1672, which involved stopping the repayment of loans to bankers out of the proceeds of taxes. Although many contemporaries blamed Ashley, the policy was in fact Clifford's; Ashley opposed it as being against &#145;common justice&#146;, &#145;the law&#146;, and the king's &#145;constant promises&#146;, and predicted that it would &#145;ruin thousands&#146; and depress trade  (Christie, 2.59).<br>
<br>The declaration of war against the Dutch was preceded by the issuance of a declaration of indulgence on 15 March 1672, suspending &#145;all manner of penal laws in matters ecclesiastical&#146; against both protestant nonconformists and Catholics, and allowing the former to take out licences to hold their own religious meetings in public  (Kenyon, 407). The government believed it necessary to conciliate the nonconformists lest they side with their Dutch co-religionists once war was declared, and Ashley strongly supported the measure. The declaration of war was followed by new honours for the members of the Cabal, to induce them to remain united behind the controversial royal policy. Ashley became earl of Shaftesbury and Baron Cooper of Paulet, the patent being dated 23 April 1672, and on 17 November he was appointed lord chancellor. When parliament reconvened on 4 February 1673 Shaftesbury, in his new official capacity, gave a lengthy address justifying the royal policy in which he urged the need for large supplies in order to prosecute the war, accused the Dutch of being the common enemies of all monarchies and their only rivals in trade (declaring in one famous outburst, &#145;Delenda est Carthago, Carthage must be destroyed&#146;), defended the stop of the exchequer (while urging the Commons to consider what might be done to help the bankers who had been affected by it), and vindicated the declaration of indulgence.<br>
<br>The Commons unanimously voted a supply of &pound;1.26 million to be raised over a period of eighteen months, but demanded the redress of a number of grievances before it would enact the <span class="roman">Supply Bill</span>. Prior to the reconvening of parliament Shaftesbury, as lord chancellor, had issued writs to fill thirty-six seats that had fallen vacant during the prorogation. Although there were precedents, normally such writs were issued by the speaker, and since the great majority of the newly elected members were supporters of the court Shaftesbury's initiatives looked like an attempt by the government to pack parliament. Colonel Giles Strangways, an old Dorset rival, led the attack, and the elections were declared void. The Commons also demanded that Charles withdraw the indulgence. Shaftesbury advised the king to send an answer to the Commons maintaining the ecclesiastical supremacy but denying any claim to suspend laws in which the properties, rights, and liberties of the subject were affected and offering to concur with any bill presented to him for liberty of conscience; the Commons refused to accept this, however, and in the end Charles himself backed down and cancelled the indulgence. The Commons then presented an address against the growth of popery and proceeded to promote a <span class="roman">Test Act</span> (enacted 20 March 1673), requiring all holders of civil and military office to take the Anglican sacrament and make a declaration against transubstantiation. Despite his championship of the indulgence Shaftesbury supported the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, though there was nothing necessarily inconsistent in this; even dissenters at this time realized that the most they could hope for was religious liberty, not full civil liberty. Shaftesbury took the Anglican sacrament together with the duke of Monmouth at St Clement Danes Church in the Strand, with Shaftesbury's secretary, John Locke, serving as witness to both. Shaftesbury supported a bill for the ease of dissenters when it came before the Lords towards the end of March, though he wanted to insert a clause giving the king power to issue proclamations on religious matters and he objected to the Commons' proposal to restrict the ease to those who were willing to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, which would have excluded many sectaries. The adjournment on 29 March put a stop to further debate on the bill, and parliament failed to pick up on the measure when it reconvened in October.<br>
<br>The failure of the indulgence and the passage of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> meant the days of the Cabal were numbered. For the time being, however, Shaftesbury remained in office, despite moving closer to the political opposition in parliament. Although some, including the king, suspected his loyalty, it is highly unlikely that he was involved in any intrigues with the Dutch against the English government, though now he was certainly keen to end the war and in favour of negotiating peace directly with the Dutch. The failure of the duke of York to take the Anglican sacrament at Easter 1673, moreover, reignited Shaftesbury's concern about the prospect of a Catholic successor. In June a letter of his to the duke urging him to change his religion was circulated. The succession issue became more pressing when York decided to take the Italian archduchess Mary of Modena (a French prot&eacute;g&eacute;e) as his second wife in autumn 1673; James had two daughters with his first wife, Anne Hyde (<i>d</i>. 1671), both of whom had been brought up as protestants, but a son with his second would take precedence in the succession and raised the prospect of a never-ending succession of Catholic kings. The marriage had been celebrated by proxy, and Mary had still not arrived in England when parliament reconvened on 20 October. York was anxious that parliament should be prorogued immediately for a few days, to prevent the Commons protesting against the match; Shaftesbury, however, deliberately retarded the summons of the lower house before the Lords, which gave the Commons time to draw up an address to the king urging that the marriage not be consummated. It was too late to put a stop to the marriage, however, so Shaftesbury now revived the idea of trying to persuade Charles to divorce the queen and take a second wife. He also joined with Arlington, Ormond, and secretary Henry Coventry in advising Charles to send his brother away from court. York was incensed and pressed the king to dismiss Shaftesbury from office. Charles, who had become increasingly suspicious of Shaftesbury's loyalty over the last few months and now had reason to believe he was intriguing with Scottish malcontents in order to stoke up opposition to Lauderdale in the upcoming session of the Scottish parliament, agreed that his lord chancellor would have to go. On Sunday 9 November he sent Secretary Coventry (Shaftesbury's brother-in-law) privately to Exeter House with two warrants, one for the seals, and the other for a royal pardon for all crimes committed before 5 November; Shaftesbury is reported to have said &#145;It is only laying down my gown, and putting on my sword&#146;  (Christie, vol. 2, appx 3, p. xliii n.).<h2>
<a name="Countrypolitician16741678"></a>Country politician, 1674&#150;1678</h2>It was not clear at first that Shaftesbury's fall from favour would be permanent. Towards the end of November 1673 Arlington tried to broker a reconciliation with the king, and even persuaded the French ambassador that Shaftesbury might be won back with an appropriate bribe. Shaftesbury refused such overtures, protesting that he would not &#145;be a friend to the French King&#146; and support &#145;an interest that was so apparently destructive to [Englishmen's] religion and trade&#146;  (Christie, vol. 2, appx 3, p. xliv). According to the Venetian secretary he instead set himself up &#145;as the organ of the Spanish party&#146; and offered the king friendship with Spain, peace with the Netherlands, reconciliation with parliament, and money to defray the expenses of the last war, if he would &#145;repudiate the queen and make a second marriage, so as to exclude by his own offspring the suspected progeny of the duke of York&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1673&#150;5</i>, 183).<br>
<br>In the parliamentary session which began on 7 January 1674 Shaftesbury's main preoccupation was the threat of popery and the prospect of a Catholic succession. On the 8th he gave an impassioned speech warning that there were more than 16,000 Catholics in the London area ready to rebel, prompting the Lords to address the king for a proclamation ordering all papists to depart 10 miles from the capital, and four days later he proposed that every peer should take the oath of allegiance before entering the house, including the duke of York. Shaftesbury was now co-ordinating tactics with a group of malcontent peers&#151;including Carlisle, Fauconberg, Holles, Salisbury, Buckingham, and Halifax&#151;who met at Holles's house to discuss what measures to introduce in parliament. The fruits of their efforts were revealed on 24 January when Salisbury moved for a bill to provide for the education of York's children as protestants, Carlisle proposed that in future neither the king nor any prince of the blood should marry a Catholic without the consent of parliament, and Halifax called for the disarming of all Catholics. The Lords responded by appointing a committee to prepare a bill for securing the protestant religion. When, on 10 February, the house came to debate the clause in the proposed bill forbidding a prince of the blood from marrying a Catholic without parliamentary consent Carlisle and Halifax proposed that the penalty for its breach should be exclusion from the succession. Shaftesbury spoke strongly in favour of the measure, insisting that there were precedents, though the proposal was dropped in the face of opposition from the bishops and the lord keeper, Sir Heneage Finch. Shaftesbury and Carlisle were next said to be considering proposing that York's regiments of guards be disbanded, while Shaftesbury also accepted responsibility for presenting a petition that Ireland was in danger from a French invasion; when Charles learned that the opposition peers were intending a direct attack on York, and might even seek to accuse him of treason, he speedily prorogued parliament (24 February). It would be wrong to create the impression that party lines were irreconcilably drawn in this session, however. Shaftesbury and his presbyterian associates, Holles, Carlisle, Fauconberg, Clare, and Salisbury, together with Charles's new leading minister, the earl of Danby, supported a <span class="roman">Comprehension Bill</span> sponsored by the bishop of Winchester and backed by six other bishops, which would have removed some of the presbyterian ministers' chief objections to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. The bill passed the Lords but was lost with the prorogation.<br>
<br>On 19 May 1674 Shaftesbury was expelled from the privy council; he was subsequently removed as lord lieutenant of Dorset and ordered to leave London. Successive prorogations meant that parliament did not meet again until 13 April 1675. Early in the new year there was talk that Shaftesbury was to be brought back into favour by the court, and might even be appointed vicar-general in ecclesiastical affairs, a position previously held only by Thomas Cromwell. On 3 February, however, Shaftesbury wrote a letter to the earl of Carlisle, which was widely circulated in manuscript, where he stated that the only advice he could offer the king would be to call &#145;a new Parliament&#146;, and that he would not return to court until he saw that &#145;the King thinks frequent parliaments as much his interest as they are the people's right&#146;  (Christie, 2.201). With Danby having determined upon an alliance with Anglican royalists and a strict enforcement of the penal laws against both Catholics and protestant nonconformists, even York began making overtures for a possible alliance with Shaftesbury's group of disaffected peers. By early April an astonished Venetian secretary could report that Shaftesbury (who was back in town for the upcoming parliamentary session) and York were reconciled, and that Holles &#145;and the rest of the confederates [had] all assured the duke of their desire to serve him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1673&#150;5</i>, 391). When parliament assembled later that month Danby brought forward his notorious <span class="roman">Test Bill</span>, which would have required all office-holders and members of both houses to declare against the lawfulness of resistance and swear never to endeavour the alteration of the government in either church or state. Shaftesbury led the opposition to the test in a lengthy series of debates which lasted over several weeks, maintaining that resistance to those commissioned by the king could, in some circumstances, be legitimate and that endeavouring to alter the church so as to restore it, say, &#145;to what it was in Queen Elizabeths days might consist with his being a very good Protestant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter</span>, 22). Yet despite all Shaftesbury's efforts opponents of the test were in the minority in all divisions. The bill got held up, however, as a result of a jurisdictional dispute between the Lords and Commons over the case of <i>Shirley v. Fagg</i>, the central issue of which involved whether the Lords had the right to hear appeals from lower courts when they involved members of the Commons. Shaftesbury did his best to ensure that the two houses remained at loggerheads over the case, thus causing a deadlock to business and leaving Charles with no alternative but to prorogue parliament (9 June). In a surprising development Shaftesbury was admitted to kiss the king's hand on 13 June. The reconciliation was probably York's doing; he apparently promised Shaftesbury that he could procure a new parliament and Danby's dismissal, while Charles, who never liked committing himself to one minister, welcomed the chance to keep other options open. In the end Danby succeeded in blocking the initiative and Shaftesbury was ordered away from court again on the 24th.<br>
<br>In July 1675 Giles Strangways, MP for Dorset, died, which meant there would be a by-election once parliament reconvened in October and the speaker authorized the sending out of a writ. At first Shaftesbury said he would back Lord Digby, the son of the earl of Bristol, but when he learned that Digby was corresponding with the court he threw his support behind Thomas Moore of Hawkchurch, the principal supporter of conventicles in the county. Digby felt betrayed and at a chance meeting in late August threatened Shaftesbury with his sword, saying: &#145;You are against the King, and for seditions and factions, and for a commonwealth, and I will prove it, and by God, we will have your head next Parliament&#146;  (Christie, 2.215). Shaftesbury brought an action for <i>scandalum magnatum</i> against Digby and obtained &pound;1000 in damages; he gave the money to help rebuild the town of Northampton, which had been badly damaged in a fire. Digby nevertheless won the by-election by a large majority of over 1700 votes to 520, and in the subsequent session of parliament Digby's father, Lord Bristol, also launched a verbal attack on the earl, for which he was forced to apologize.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury must have spent some of summer 1675 preparing <span class="italic">A Letter from a Person of Quality to his Friend in the Country</span>, a 15,000-word pamphlet attacking Danby's test which began by accusing &#145;the High Episcopal Man, and the Old Cavalier&#146; of conspiring since the Restoration to make &#145;the Government absolute and Arbitrary&#146; and establish divine right monarchy and episcopacy, not &#145;bounded or limited by humane Laws&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter</span>, 1). The pamphlet caused quite a stir when it hit the streets in November: at first it sold for just 1<i>s</i>., but it was soon fetching 20<i>s</i>.. There has been debate as to whether the tract was really Shaftesbury's work or Locke's, or whether the earl dictated it and his secretary wrote it down, though it was probably a collaboration of some sort. When parliament reconvened on 13 October Shaftesbury did his best to revive the dispute over <i>Shirley v. Fagg</i>, in the hope that if another session ended in deadlock the king would be forced to dissolve parliament and call new elections. He was probably one of those who persuaded Shirley to bring in his petition again, and when Danby tried to divert it Shaftesbury gave a lengthy speech (20 October) in which he linked the interests &#145;of the Poorest man in <i>England</i>&#146; to the preservation of the rights of the upper house, since no prince, Shaftesbury claimed, &#145;ever governed without <i>Nobility</i> or an <i>Army</i>&#146;, and that if you did not have the one you would inevitably have the other  (A. A. Cooper, earl of Shaftesbury, <span class="italic">Two Speeches</span>, 1675, 7). He ended with a stinging attack on the bishops, accusing them of not believing the king was &#145;<i>King by Law</i>&#146; but that monarchy was &#145;<i>of Divine Right</i>&#146;  (ibid., 10): if this be true, he said, &#145;our <span class="italic">Magna Charta</span> is of no force, our Laws are but Rules amongst our selves during the Kings pleasure&#146; and &#145;All the Properties and Liberties of the People, are to give way, not onely to the interest, but the will and pleasure of the Crown&#146;  (ibid., 11). On 20 November, in a premeditated move, Shaftesbury seconded Lord Mohun's motion that in order to bring the dispute over <i>Shirley v. Fagg</i> to an end, the king should dissolve parliament. When the motion, which was also supported by York and the Catholic peers, was narrowly defeated by a vote of fifty to forty-eight, Shaftesbury and twenty-one other peers entered a protest, on the grounds that &#145;according to the ancient Lawes and Statutes of this Realm &hellip; there should be frequent and new Parliaments&#146; and that the actions of the Commons had made it impossible for the two houses to work together  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 13, 1675&#150;81, 33). Charles prorogued parliament two days later until 15 February 1677. Shaftesbury was probably involved in the publication of <span class="italic">Two Seasonable Discourses Concerning the Present Parliament</span> (1675), purporting to consist of arguments used in the debates of 20 November, which predicted that a new parliament would vote the king money, preserve the church, grant dissenters liberty of conscience, and deliver Catholics from the penal laws if they were deprived of access to court and prevented from holding office and bearing arms.<br>
<br>In mid-February 1676 Charles sent the secretary of state, Sir Joseph Williamson, to Shaftesbury with a message to leave town; Shaftesbury refused to go, protesting that he meddled with nothing but his own private business. When he was subsequently seen receiving visits at Exeter House from opposition MPs and discontented elements in the City, Danby urged Charles to send Shaftesbury to the Tower; Shaftesbury was saved because Williamson refused to sign the necessary warrant. Exeter House was proving too expensive to keep up, however, now Shaftesbury was no longer lord chancellor, and he moved out in the summer. After spending a few months in the west country he moved into Thanet House in Aldersgate Street in the autumn. Shaftesbury was still in London when, at the shrieval election at the Guildhall on 24 June, linen draper Francis Jenks made a sensational speech urging the common council to petition the king for a new parliament, arguing that as a result of the fifteen-month prorogation the present one was <i>ipso facto</i> dissolved because two statutes from Edward III's reign required parliaments be held every year. Although government pamphleteers accused Shaftesbury of being behind the initiative, it was Buckingham who had put Jenks up to it; Shaftesbury opposed the step as premature. He did, however, decide to pursue the idea in the upcoming session of parliament. He and his allies printed and dispersed a number of pamphlets outlining their case; one, <span class="italic">Some considerations upon the question, whether the parliament is dissolved, by its prorogation for 15 months?</span>, answered the objection that the prorogation of parliament was a matter solely for the royal prerogative by insisting not only that parliament could restrict that but that it could even &#145;bind, limit, restrain and govern the Descent and Inheritance of the Crown it self&#146;  (Holles, 26). Shaftesbury tried to convince York that this had been put in at the last minute without his knowledge; Buckingham, on the other hand, told York that Shaftesbury &#145;had drawn it, and caus'd it to be inserted&#146;  (Clarke, 1.505). When parliament met on 15 February Buckingham, backed by Shaftesbury, Salisbury, and Wharton, proclaimed that in accordance with the statutes of Edward III no parliament was legally in existence; the motion was rejected, and when the four refused to ask pardon for their action they were sent to the Tower. Shaftesbury tried petitioning for his release, to no effect, and so in June he brought a writ of habeas corpus before king's bench; the judges, however, determined they had no jurisdiction in the matter, since the prisoner was being held by a superior court while parliament was in session. Although Charles freed Buckingham, Salisbury, and Wharton shortly thereafter, he was determined to humble Shaftesbury, while Shaftesbury remained determined not to apologize. What seems to have changed Shaftesbury's mind was the raising of an army in England, supposedly to be used in a war against France but which many thought was the first step in a design to establish a standing army. On 25 February 1678 he finally made a full submission, begging the king's and the house's pardon, and apologizing for bringing his action of habeas corpus. He was released the next day. During his stay in the Tower, Shaftesbury compiled a list of the political sympathies of the lay peers and members of the House of Commons, marking those whom he thought of as his allies with a &#145;w&#146; for &#145;worthy&#146; and his enemies with a &#145;v&#146; for &#145;vile&#146;, using double or triple letters to signify extra degrees of worthiness or vileness.<br>
<br>Early in 1678, when it looked as if Charles might declare war on France, the French ambassador approached Russell, Holles, and Buckingham offering Louis XIV's help in securing a dissolution of parliament; Russell, in return, promised to work to prevent further votes of supply and promised to engage Shaftesbury in the affair. Shaftesbury must have known of these discussions, since Russell visited him in the Tower on several occasions, but it is doubtful whether the suggested meeting between Shaftesbury and the French ambassador ever took place upon Shaftesbury's release. Indeed, far from wanting to help the French king neutralize Charles II on the foreign policy front, in March Shaftesbury joined with Buckingham, Holles, Halifax, and others in urging the Lords to join with the Commons in addressing the king to declare war immediately on France. When war was not forthcoming Shaftesbury supported the Commons in pushing for a speedy disbandment of troops, and on 25 June he signed a protest against a Lords' amendment to the <span class="roman">Disbanding Bill</span> delaying the date at which the forces were to be disbanded. Charles prorogued parliament on 15 July; it was not to reconvene until 21 October, which was after Titus Oates had made his revelations of a supposed popish plot to murder the king and massacre English protestants. Shaftesbury played a prominent role in the Lords in prosecuting the plot, being a member of nearly all the important committees. On 2 November he proposed that the Lords should demand that York be removed from the king's presence, though he did not press the matter to a division. He supported the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> designed to exclude Catholics from both houses of parliament, and on 29 November was one of three peers who entered a protest against the Lords' refusal to concur with a Commons address for removing the queen and her retinue from court after Oates had accused her of being involved in the plot. With Danby now under threat of impeachment, the king prorogued parliament on 30 December; on 24 January 1679 he dissolved it. Outside parliament Londoners were already beginning to view Shaftesbury as the great hero of the opposition to the court. When on 9 November 1678 the king promised MPs he would pass any bills that would make them safe in the reign of his successor, so long as they did not impeach the right of the succession, his speech was mistakenly reported as a resolution in favour of a protestant successor or the duke of Monmouth, prompting celebratory bonfires throughout the capital where crowds &#145;drank healths to the King, the Duke of Monmouth, and Earl of Shaftesbury, as the only three pillars of all safety&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.473). The citizens held Shaftesbury in such esteem that, fearing a Catholic plot against his life, they paid for a special guard to protect him.<h2>
<a name="Theexclusioncrisisandthefirstwhigs16791683"></a>The exclusion crisis and the first whigs, 1679&#150;1683</h2>Shaftesbury emerged as one of the leading figures in the whig campaign to exclude the duke of York from the succession in the three successive parliaments which met between 1679 and 1681. It would be wrong, however, to see him as the leader of a coherent and well-organized whig party. The whig movement was never that cohesive, and Shaftesbury's control over it was far from complete; indeed, he often found himself at odds with other prominent figures in the political opposition to Charles II and the duke of York. Although he tried to use his patronage to influence elections where possible, he did not have a strong enough regional power base to secure the return of a large clientele of compliant MPs. Shaftesbury's precise role in co-ordinating the activities of the whig press is also unclear. Danby was informed that Shaftesbury &#145;could have what he pleased printed, and that in a night's time&#146;  (Haley, 499); Shaftesbury certainly had close contacts with a number of whig printers, though he did not have his own printing press in Thanet House, as Danby thought, and the older view that he was the guiding spirit behind much of the whig propaganda that poured forth from the presses undoubtedly exaggerates his influence. Shaftesbury was not even a member of the famous Green Ribbon Club that met at the King's Head tavern in Chancery Lane, which is known to have played some role in co-ordinating the whig propaganda campaign (though it should be noted that a number of his relatives and dependants were, including his trusty steward, Thomas Stringer). Shaftesbury kept his own clubs at the Swan in Fish Street, the Angel tavern near the Old Exchange, the Queen's Arms, and the Nag's Head. It has even been claimed that the term &#145;exclusion crisis&#146; is a misnomer, since the battle lines were not drawn solely over whether or not to pass an exclusion bill: some whigs were willing to entertain other expedients to resolve the problem of the Catholic succession; Shaftesbury himself continued to push for a royal divorce and even tried to persuade Charles to make Monmouth his heir, though both schemes, it should be recognized, were attempts to exclude York from the succession by other means.<br>
<br>Before the meeting of the new parliament on 6 March 1679 Shaftesbury drew up another list of lay peers and MPs predicting how they would align themselves politically. He estimated that in the Commons the court could count on 32 per cent of the members, the opposition 61 per cent, with the remaining 7 per cent being doubtful. He also produced a document, &#145;The present state of the kingdom&#146;, in which he voiced his concern over the power of France, the Popish Plot, and the evil influence exercised on the king's affairs by Danby, the duchess of Portsmouth (the royal mistress), and York, who Shaftesbury claimed designed &#145;to introduce a military and arbitrary government in his brother's time&#146;  (Christie, 2.314). The paper, probably intended as a pamphlet, was never published, though Shaftesbury did deliver a dramatic speech on the state of the nation in the Lords on 25 March, in which he warned of the double threat of popery and arbitrary government to the three kingdoms and castigated the record of the royal administration in Scotland under Lauderdale and in Ireland under Ormond. Shaftesbury supported the efforts of the Commons to bring Danby to account and voted for the <span class="roman">Bill of Attainder</span> when it passed the Lords on 14 April by the narrow margin of thirty-nine to thirty-six votes. He subsequently tried to neutralize Danby's allies on the episcopal bench by moving that the bishops should not be allowed to sit in the Lords in capital trials.<br>
<br>Charles thought that Shaftesbury &#145;was only angry in revenge, because he was not employed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 302), and so, on 21 April 1679, decided to appoint him lord president of a reconstructed privy council, with a salary of &pound;4000 a year. Shaftesbury soon made it clear, however, that he was not being bought off. A few days later, when he unsuccessfully opposed a motion in the Lords that protestant nonconformists, including Quakers, should be administered the same oaths of allegiance required of Roman Catholics, he protested that he would never have taken office &#145;if he had thought he could not succeed in a matter of such consequence&#146; and &#145;that he desired his post in the Council only that he might .. take care of the safety and interests of the whole nation&#146;  (Christie, 2.328). He pressed the case in council for excluding York and &#145;making the succession to go on, as if he was dead&#146;; Essex and Halifax urged limiting the powers of a popish successor instead, but Shaftesbury insisted that this was &#145;much more prejudicial to the crown than the exclusion of one heir&#146;, since it &#145;changed the whole government, and set up a democracy instead of a monarchy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 303). Shaftesbury's right-hand man in the Commons, William, Lord Russell, introduced an <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> in the lower house on 11 May, which passed its second reading on 21 May, though to block the bill and to stop any further proceedings against Danby, Charles at first prorogued (27 May) and then dissolved parliament (3 July). On both occasions Shaftesbury is reputed to have said that he would have the heads of those who advised it. The only measure of any note to come out of this parliament was the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Amendment Act</span>, sometimes known as the <span class="roman">Shaftesbury Act</span>, which aimed to stop up certain loopholes in the traditional habeas corpus procedure; it passed on the last day of the session by fifty-seven votes to fifty-five, but only because Lord Grey of Warke (jokingly at first) decided to count one particularly fat peer as ten, and no one spotted the error.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury decided to stay on the privy council for the time being, telling his friends that he did so &#145;only to be a tribune for the people there&#146;  (Haley, 530); according to Lord Chancellor Finch, Shaftesbury &#145;joined with the Duke of Monmouth&#146; on the council to &#145;obstruct all&#146; until they were &#145;at the top of all affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of &hellip; Sidney</span>, 2). The earl nevertheless found the duke a frustrating man to deal with. When Monmouth led the government forces against the rebellious Scottish covenanters in June 1679 Shaftesbury was said to be &#145;ill pleased&#146; with Monmouth's decision to inflict a quick and decisive victory over the covenanter army at Bothwell Bridge, since if the rebellion had been more drawn out it might have forced Charles to recall parliament  (Haley, 536). Nevertheless, in early August Shaftesbury and Monmouth were observed to be meeting &#145;very often&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.388), and on one occasion they apparently proposed to the earl of Bath, Danby's ally, that they would help secure Danby's release from the Tower if he would reveal how York had on a number of occasions urged the king to rule through armed force. Nothing came of the suggestion, and on 19 August Shaftesbury left for Dorset. Two days later, however, Charles fell ill; with the king's brother in exile in Brussels, Essex and Halifax feared a coup by Monmouth and advised York to make a speedy return. Charles soon recovered and sent both York and Monmouth out of the country, but in early October he allowed his brother to change his place of exile from Flanders to Scotland. Shaftesbury, now back in London, summoned an extraordinary meeting of the council to discuss the duke's move, acting on his own authority as president while the king was away at Newmarket. This proved the final straw for Charles and on 14 October he informed Shaftesbury that his attendance at the council was no longer required.<br>
<br>It was about this time that the Meal Tub Plot, an attempt by a group of Catholics to frame Shaftesbury and other opposition leaders for treason, came to light. When revealed as a sham its leading informer, Thomas Dangerfield, changed his story and claimed that the Catholics had offered him money to kill the king and the earl of Shaftesbury. The revelations led to renewed talk on the council about the need to bring forward the meeting of parliament; a new parliament had been due to convene in October 1679, but the elections that summer had gone badly for the court and the king had prorogued it until 26 January. When Charles refused to meet parliament any earlier Essex resigned his commissionership of the Treasury, fuelling speculation that Shaftesbury was his intended replacement. Indeed, in early November the earl of Sunderland did try to broker a reconciliation between Shaftesbury and the king, but Shaftesbury made it clear that he would return to office only if Charles would &#145;leave to Parliament all that concerned the Queen and the Duke of York&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.558). Shaftesbury now decided to launch a petitioning campaign to pressure the king into meeting parliament and held a series of meetings with other whig peers at the Swan tavern in Fleet Street to plot tactics. As a preliminary he wrote to Monmouth urging him to return from exile; the duke arrived back in London late on the night of 27 November, to scenes of widespread celebrating throughout the capital. The first petition was delivered to the king on 7 December, signed by Shaftesbury and fifteen other whig peers, asking that parliament be allowed to meet on 26 January 1680. This was followed by a monster petition in the name of the inhabitants of Westminster and Southwark, signed by some 20,000 people (including Shaftesbury), delivered to the king on 13 January, and several provincial petitions. When the king prorogued parliament again and recalled his brother from Scotland instead, Shaftesbury wrote a letter to his friends on the council (30 January) urging them to resign; four did.<br>
<br>On 24 March 1680 Shaftesbury told the council of information he had received concerning a planned Catholic uprising in Ireland backed by French aid. The Irish plot was not new&#151;there had been unsubstantiated rumours to this effect for years&#151;but these latest revelations afforded Shaftesbury the opportunity to highlight the continuing Catholic threat at a time when popular anxieties over the Popish Plot was beginning to flag. The secretary of state, Henry Coventry, was convinced the Irish stories were a complete fabrication, designed for their effect on public opinion, but although Shaftesbury showed no qualms about exploiting them for this end there is no concrete evidence that he was guilty of subornation of witnesses. The government had no option but to launch an inquiry, and in the end the plot cost the life of Oliver Plunket, the Catholic archbishop of Armagh.<br>
<br>On 13 May 1680 the king again fell ill, prompting concerns about the security of the protestant religion should he suddenly die. According to a later confession by the Rye House plotter and Monmouth rebel Ford, Lord Grey of Warke, a series of meetings was held at Shaftesbury's house (involving Monmouth, Russell, Grey, and others) where plans were laid for an uprising in the city, although these were abandoned when the king recovered [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93794', "Rye House plotters")</script>]. Other whig accounts, however, insist that there was no talk of an uprising prior to the third Exclusion Parliament (in Oxford) of March 1681, and since Grey himself could not remember whether the king's illness was before or after the Oxford parliament, his testimony may not be trustworthy. With the king back to full health Shaftesbury and his allies decided to strike again at the duke of York. On 26 June he and fourteen others (peers and commoners) went to Westminster Hall to present an indictment to the Middlesex grand jury against the duke as a popish recusant; the grand jury also had ready a petition for the calling of parliament, but before they could do anything they were dismissed for interfering in matters of state. Shaftesbury tried again four days later, but was prevented once more by the dismissal of a second grand jury.<br>
<br>By mid-September 1680 Shaftesbury was holding meetings at Thanet House to prepare for the upcoming parliamentary session, which began on 21 October. He took his seat in the Lords on the 23rd and immediately called for a committee to be set up to investigate the Popish Plot. He spoke passionately in support of the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> on 15 November when it came before the Lords where he became locked in debate with his kinsman Halifax, who favoured limitations. The result was always a foregone conclusion, however, given the number of court peers and the dead weight of the bishops, and the Lords rejected the bill on its second reading by a vote of sixty-three to thirty. The following day Essex proposed a <span class="roman">Bill of Association</span>, modelled on that of 1585 to protect Queen Elizabeth from assassination by protestants, and Shaftesbury was appointed to a subcommittee to consider it. Halifax suggested banishing York for five years; Shaftesbury replied that the best way of protecting the kingdom had been rejected, and that the only other remedy was for the king to divorce and remarry. The Lords set aside 23 November to discuss the proposal, but Shaftesbury was absent that day due to gout; when he returned on the 24th he surprisingly suggested that all expedients should be tabled for the time being, apparently convinced that financial stringency would eventually force the king to give in to exclusion. Shaftesbury gave a violent speech in the Lords on 23 December reiterating his support for exclusion; in this he attacked York, expressed distrust of the king, and urged that no taxes be voted until &#145;the King shall satisfie the People, that what we give is not to make us Slaves and Papists&#146;  (A. A. Cooper, earl of Shaftesbury, <span class="italic">A Speech Lately Made by a Noble Peer of the Realm</span>, 1681). With the Commons threatening to impeach some of his judges and actively pursuing the Irish plot Charles decided to prorogue parliament on 10 January; eight days later he dissolved it and announced his intention to call another at Oxford on 21 March. The only bill that was ready to receive the royal assent was that repealing an act of 1593 against sectaries; Charles secretly ordered the clerk not to present it to him, however, and thus even this measure was lost.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1681 Shaftesbury, Essex, Salisbury, and others presented a petition to the king signed by sixteen peers asking that parliament might sit at Westminster rather than Oxford, though to no avail. According to Grey's later account Shaftesbury, Russell, Monmouth, and others thought about staying in London, ready to raise the City in support of parliament if the king issued another dissolution. If Shaftesbury did ever contemplate this it was not for long, for by the end of January he was making arrangements for his accommodation in Oxford. In the forthcoming parliamentary elections, several constituencies drew up instructions to their newly elected MPs, advising them what measures to support at Oxford, many of them calling explicitly for a commitment to exclusion. The fact that a draft set of instructions survives in the Shaftesbury papers has led some historians to conclude that Shaftesbury was largely responsible for co-ordinating the campaign. This is questionable, however; a comparison between the draft and the actual addresses reveals significant differences, and the constituency instructions, rather than being dictated to the localities by a central whig party machine, appear to have been the result of local initiatives. As a prelude to the meeting at Oxford, Shaftesbury and his supporters brought another indictment against York for recusancy, this time at the Old Bailey, on 26 February. The grand jury found the bill true, but York's defence counsel asked for a delay until Easter week before their client was declared convicted, and in the end the prosecution lapsed.<br>
<br>In his opening speech to the Oxford parliament Charles insisted that he would not depart from the succession but would listen to any expedient that might &#145;remove all reasonable Fears that may arise from the Possibility of a Popish Successor coming to the Crown&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 13, 1675&#150;81, 745). Shaftesbury's first move was to call for an inquiry into why the bill repealing the act of 1593 had not been passed. Then on 24 March he announced that he had received an anonymous letter containing an &#145;expedient&#146; which would &#145;comply with the King's speech, and satisfy the people too&#146;; when shown to the king it turned out to be a proposal for settling the crown on Monmouth. Charles was furious, protesting that this expedient would &#145;trample over all laws of God and Man&#146;; Shaftesbury replied by asking for &#145;leave to make it as lawful as we can&#146;  (Haley, 634). Later that day Charles asked Shaftesbury &#145;whether no other expedient could be found out instead of the Exclusion&#146;; Shaftesbury replied &#145;no, and that the whole nation seemed to be of that opinion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 6.6&#150;7). The Commons brought in an <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> on Saturday the 26th; two days later Charles dissolved the parliament. Much of the short life of the Oxford parliament was taken up discussing whether to impeach Edward Fitzharris, accused initially of a design of trying to fasten upon Shaftesbury a libel he had concocted himself against the king but who was now offering to make startling revelations about York's involvement in the Popish Plot. Charles wanted Fitzharris left to the common law and permanently silenced by being sentenced to death; by initiating impeachment proceedings the Commons hoped to give Fitzharris the opportunity to reveal all he knew before parliament. On the 26th the Lords voted not to agree to the impeachment. Shaftesbury was one of twenty peers who signed a protest.<br>
<br>Following the dissolution of the Oxford parliament the whigs' hopes fell back on the corporation of London bringing pressure on Charles to call another parliament. To increase his influence in the City, Shaftesbury procured admission as a freeman of the Skinners' Company on 3 May 1681. By now, however, the government was on the offensive; on 2 July Shaftesbury was arrested on suspicion of high treason, the main witnesses against him being the very informants whom Shaftesbury had used in the Irish plot, and was sent to the Tower. The government also ordered his papers to be seized, though nothing particularly incriminating was found, except for an anonymous draft of an association. Monmouth immediately went to visit Shaftesbury in the Tower; the king responded by ordering that Shaftesbury be kept close prisoner and allowed visits only from his wife and children.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury petitioned the Old Bailey that he be brought to trial or bailed under the terms of the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span>, but the judges declared that they had no jurisdiction over prisoners in the Tower and that he would have to wait until the next term began in the king's bench in October. In late September he offered to retire either to his country estate, beyond seas, or to Carolina if he were released (and if the last, proposing that the king should give him &pound;3000 to meet the cost of transporting himself and his family there). Charles said he would leave Shaftesbury to the law. On 24 October Shaftesbury moved for a writ of habeas corpus at king's bench, whereupon he was told that bail would be granted if there was no prosecution before the end of the term. Shaftesbury's case finally came before a grand jury on 24 November. His indictment accused him of having said, on 18 March 1681, that he and his supporters in parliament would compel the king to accept the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> and the bills for relief of dissenters, that armed men had been prepared, that the king &#145;deserved to be deposed&#146;, and that he (Shaftesbury) would &#145;never desist, until he had brought this kingdom of England into a commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 8.777). The first piece of evidence produced was the draft association found among his papers which accused York of complicity in the Popish Plot and engaged subscribers to do all they could to prevent him from coming to the throne. A succession of witnesses then appeared, most of whom had been informants in the Popish and Irish plots, to testify to the treasonable remarks Shaftesbury was supposed to have made. The government's case was not a strong one. There was no convincing proof that Shaftesbury had ever intended to use force against the king; the association was not in the earl's handwriting, and was unsigned and undated; the law required that prosecutions for uttering treasonable words had to be made within six months, making Shaftesbury's alleged words out of date; and the witnesses against him were people whom even the government thought had previously perjured themselves. Yet because jury panels were selected by the London sheriffs, both of whom at this time were whig, there was never much likelihood that the grand jury would find the bill true and send the case to trial; Shaftesbury's grand jury comprised prominent exclusionists and whig merchants, many of them with known dissenting sympathies, and predictably brought in a verdict of ignoramus. The news prompted bonfire celebrations in London, with crowds roaming the streets shouting &#145;No Popish Successor, No York, A Monmouth&#146; and &#145;God bless the Earl of Shaftesbury&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 583), while there was similar rejoicing in other parts of the kingdom when news of Shaftesbury's deliverance reached the provinces. Shaftesbury was released on bail on 28 November, to commemorate which Shaftesbury's supporters had a medal coined showing the earl on one side and on the other the Tower, with the sun emerging from a cloud and the word &#145;Laetamur&#146; (&#145;let us rejoice&#146;). When Shaftesbury reappeared in court on 13 February 1682 to answer his bail the prosecution against him was completely dropped.<br>
<br>Another royal illness that May prompted Shaftesbury to call an emergency meeting at Thanet House, attended by Monmouth, Russell, Grey, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and Major John Manley, to discuss what they should do were Charles to die; the group decided they would raise a rebellion with a view to summoning parliament to determine the succession, though the plan was dropped when Charles recovered. That summer Shaftesbury held talks with the earl of Argyll, the condemned Scottish traitor who had been hiding in London after his escape from Edinburgh Castle, about the possibility of funding a rebellion in Scotland, though nothing materialized since neither trusted the other. So far Shaftesbury and other radical whigs appear to have contemplated only how to act upon the king's unexpected death. They decided to take a more proactive stance following the confirmation of two tories as sheriffs elect that July, which ensured future tory control over the impanelling of London juries. No longer could dissident whigs expect to escape the clutches of the law at the hands of ignoramus juries and Shaftesbury himself faced the prospect of another treason charge on the basis of the draft association found among his papers which had not been mentioned in his previous indictment. Shaftesbury held a series of meetings at Thanet House, where plans were laid for co-ordinated rebellions in different parts of the country to try to force the king to come to terms. As preliminaries Monmouth would make a progress to Cheshire to gauge the level of support in the north-west; Russell would sound out the west country; Grey was to canvass Essex; and Shaftesbury would be responsible for London. Monmouth's progress that September was a great success, though on his return he was seized at Stafford and brought back to London under arrest, where he was released on bail. Shaftesbury wanted Monmouth to return to Cheshire immediately and launch a rebellion, but Russell advised against it and Monmouth declined to go.<br>
<br>Following the installation of the new tory sheriffs on 28 September 1682 Shaftesbury left Thanet House and went into hiding in the city, staying first in a house in Wood Street belonging to a merchant named Watson, where lodging was arranged for him under the pseudonym Mr Tucker; then at the house of Robert Ferguson, the fiery Scottish nonconformist clergyman, known best for his career as a plotter; and then with a sea captain named Tracy in Wapping. Shaftesbury had another meeting with Monmouth and Russell just before he left Thanet House in late September, and once more argued the case for an immediate insurrection, this time based on London alone, but Russell insisted they should wait for the west country, which would soon be ready. At the beginning of October Shaftesbury had a meeting with Lord Howard of Escrick at Watson's place in Wood Street, in which he said he had 10,000 men ready to fight for him in London (his &#145;ten thousand brisk boys&#146;; <span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.431; Grey, 30), complained of the recalcitrance of Monmouth and Russell, and urged Howard to lead an uprising in Essex, though Howard refused to commit himself until he had consulted the other peers. By now Shaftesbury was beginning to lose patience, and opened discussions with John Wildman and other conspirators about the possibility of assassinating the king and the duke of York on their return from the races at Newmarket later that month. When this project collapsed he turned once more to Monmouth, and finally the conspirators agreed to set a date of 19 November to launch co-ordinated uprisings in London, Cheshire, and the west county. Having had no communication from the south-west, however, it was decided at the last minute&#151;at a meeting at which Shaftesbury was not present&#151;to postpone the rebellion.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury now decided it was time to flee the country. Before he left he made provision for the repayment of his debts and the disposal of his estates to his wife and his eldest grandchild, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6209/', "Anthony Ashley Cooper, the future third earl")</script>. The exact date of Shaftesbury's departure is unknown, but it was some time after 20 November and before the 26th when he landed at the Brill; by the 28th he was in Rotterdam and on 2 December he reached his final destination, Amsterdam. There his health quickly deteriorated; by the end of December he was finding it difficult to keep down any food, and on 17 January 1683, realizing he was dying, he made his will, which was witnessed by Thomas Dare. On the night of the 20th, in a last conversation with Robert Ferguson, who had travelled to the Netherlands with him, he apparently declared himself to be a professed Arian. The next day, Sunday 21 January, at about noon, he died in Amsterdam. Since in his will he had expressed a desire to be buried at Wimborne St Giles his body was embalmed before being shipped back to Dorset on 13 February, and was buried at Wimborne on the 26th. According to his steward, Stringer, Shaftesbury's debts in 1683 totalled &pound;9724, including interest owed. The sum was considerable, but the capital value of his estates, which brought in annual rents of over &pound;3000 per annum, must have been considerably more. Interestingly, he borrowed some &pound;7600 from just six individuals between May 1680 and July 1682, which one biographer has interpreted as &#145;a collusive arrangement designed to guard against the possible confiscation of his estates by nominally mortgaging it all to friends&#146;  (Haley, 725), but which equally well might suggest efforts to raise ready cash in order to fund armed resistance.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Shaftesbury has enjoyed a somewhat tarnished historical reputation. Although Locke's epitaph for the earl praised him as &#145;a strenuous Defender [and] vigilant Preserver [of] Liberty in both Civil, and Ecclesiastical affairs&#146;, who &#145;most happily consulted [the] Publick Interest&#146; and never allowed &#145;self-interest [to] influence his Actions&#146; (Locke, &#145;Epitaph&#146;; <span class="italic">Works of John Locke</span>, 1812, 9.281), few contemporaries were so generous. His political opponents regarded him as a shallow opportunist who was quick to change sides when it suited his personal ambitions. A satirical catalogue of books of 1666 included a title &#145;How to look backwards, and forwards, of this side, and that side and every, written by the Lord Ashley&#146;  (Seaward, 213). To John Dryden, in his famous character assassination of the whigs, Shaftesbury was &#145;the false Achitophel&#146;, &#145;A Name to all succeeding Ages Curst&#146;, who was<blockquote>
<div>Restless, unfixt in Principle and Place,<br>
</div>
<div>In Power unpleas'd, impatient of Disgrace.<br>
</div> (Dryden, 6)</blockquote>Modern biographies have been more sympathetic, keen to see consistency in Shaftesbury's many volte-faces and to envisage the earl as a man motivated by political principle. It would be wrong to be too na&iuml;ve in an assessment of the earl: Shaftesbury was undoubtedly a wily operator who was not above saying or doing things for calculated political effect or abandoning former friends and allies as he mapped out a new direction for himself. Yet he clearly was a man of principles, who throughout much of his long political career was prepared to make personal sacrifices in pursuit of what he believed to be the public interest. Throughout his life he retained an abiding distrust of clerical authority (particularly the pretensions of the high-church bishops) and was a consistent supporter of toleration for dissent. Although far from being a modern liberal (his views on the role of the Lords as well as his constitution for Carolina betray an aristocratic conception of politics), he was nevertheless a firm believer in the rule of law and the sovereignty of parliament, and a passionate spokesman for the rights of the people against what he sincerely saw as the threat of arbitrary government. None of his changes of side brought him personal gain; indeed, invariably they cost him office (or the promise of an office) and not infrequently the loss of income too. Burnet, who knew Shaftesbury well, says that &#145;he was not ashamed to reckon up the many turns he had made; and he valued himself upon the doing it at the properest season, and in the best manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 64). Shaftesbury may not have been the leader of the first whig party, but he undoubtedly was a great political leader&#151;better &#145;at opposing, and running things down&#146;, than &#145;in building up&#146; perhaps, but a man who &#145;had a wonderful faculty in speaking to a popular assembly&#146; and &#145;a particular talent to make others trust to his judgment&#146;, which made him unrivalled among contemporaries, according to Burnet, &#145;in the art of governing parties, and of making himself the head of them&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
