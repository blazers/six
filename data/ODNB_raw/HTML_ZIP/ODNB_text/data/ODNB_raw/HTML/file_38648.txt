<span class="headword">Dunne <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Clairmonte, Golding Bright]</span>,  Mary Chavelita</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>George Egerton]</span>  (1859&#150;1945), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 14 December 1859 in Melbourne, Australia, the eldest of the six children of Captain John Joseph Dunne (1837&#150;1910) and Isobel George (1833&#150;1875). Her father was descended from a noble Irish family, and her mother was Welsh. Her family moved to Dublin when Dunne was eleven years old. Known as &#145;Chav&#146;, she was close to her father. He had a weakness for gambling, and could not hold down a job: the family was always in debt. Dunne was raised as a Roman Catholic, but became disenchanted by the religious hypocrisy of the Irish priesthood. On her mother's death in 1875 she was sent to school in Germany. She returned to Ireland two years later to look after her brothers and sisters, but in 1884 left for America to find work. Conditions were very hard, and the dreams and real-life stories of the working women she met in boarding houses in New York and London later provided material for many of her fictional characters.<br>
<br>In London in 1887 Mary Dunne became companion to Mrs Whyte-Melville, the wife of Henry Peter Higginson. She began an affair with Higginson and they eloped to Slottnaes Park, Langesund, Norway, where they lived until Higginson's death in 1889. He left her an income of &pound;220 a year, nearly all of which she spent on supporting her family. She learned Norwegian and read many of the new writers, such as Ibsen, Strindberg, and Bj&ouml;rnsen, who greatly influenced her own brand of realism. In 1890 she met and fell in love with Knut Pedersen, who became known as the writer Knut Hamsun (1859&#150;1952). He gave her the confidence to write subjectively about the female experience, writing that later earned her much critical praise and controversy. She translated his novel <span class="italic">Sult</span> as <span class="italic">Hunger</span> (1899).<br>
<br>In England in 1891 Mary Dunne met Egerton Tertius Clairmonte (<i>d</i>. 1901) and, attracted by his adventurous nature, she married him, although he was practically a stranger to her. Originally from Nova Scotia, he had been a gold prospector and an agent for a diamond mine in South Africa. Similar in many ways to her father, he was also hopeless with money. The couple rented a cottage in Millstreet, co. Cork, but she complained to her father that she was starting to vegetate. They returned in 1893 to London, where she wrote six stories in ten days. <span class="italic">Keynotes</span> (1893), which she dedicated to Pedersen, was an instant hit, selling over 6000 copies. It was her first and biggest success, written under the name of George Egerton, as a compliment, she said, to her mother and her husband. She was primarily a short-story writer and her realistic style and pessimistic tone lent themselves brilliantly to the form. In many ways she anticipated the modern short story. Only a woman, she wrote, could explore &#145;the <i>terra incognita</i> of herself, as she knew herself to be, not as man liked to imagine her&#151;in a word to give herself away, as man had given himself in his writings&#146;  (Egerton, 57). Although her work was associated with &#145;new woman&#146; fiction, she was embarrassed by the connection and was opposed to the women's suffrage movement. Her one novel, <span class="italic">The Wheel of God</span>, was published in 1898.<br>
<br>As George Egerton, Mary Clairmonte wrote four more volumes of short stories: <span class="italic">Discords</span> (1894); <span class="italic">Symphonies</span> (1896); <span class="italic">Fantasias</span> (1897); and <span class="italic">Flies in Amber</span> (1905). Her stories also appeared in the aesthetic literary periodical <span class="italic">The Yellow Book</span>. She had one son, George Clairmonte, born in 1895, who was killed in the First World War. Two years after George's birth her marriage to Clairmonte ended when she discovered he had made a young girl pregnant, but true to her reputation for unconventionality, she offered the girl money and some of George's outgrown clothes for the baby. She applied for divorce in 1900, and Egerton Clairmonte died less than one year later. She travelled to Norway, where she fell in love with a man fifteen years her junior; her collected love letters to him were published as <span class="italic">Rosa Amorosa</span> in 1901. He rejected her, but within four months of her return to England she accepted a proposal from Reginald Golding Bright (1874?&#150;1941), also fifteen years younger than her, and they were married on 11 July 1901. He was a dull conversationalist, but was ambitious, reliable, and kind. He later became famous as a drama critic and as a theatrical agent for writers such as George Bernard Shaw.<br>
<br>Mary Golding Bright was considered &#145;very attractive&#146;  (May, 129) and a &#145;brilliant talker&#146;, &#145;small and fragile&#146; with &#145;strikingly large and luminous eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Aug 1945). She had many admirers, though her wit could often be caustic and she did not enjoy small talk. She suffered from hypochondria, complaining of pains and minor illnesses throughout her life. By the turn of the century her best writing years were already behind her. The public's taste for &#145;new woman&#146; fiction, which examined gender roles and issues of sexuality, declined after the trial of Oscar Wilde in 1895, and her audience disappeared. The popular demand for short stories also fell, and, with no further novels after 1898, she attempted to write plays, without much success.<br>
<br>Reginald Golding Bright died in 1941. His business had been hit by the closure of the West End theatres at the beginning of the Second World War and Mary Golding Bright was left with very little money. She sold her furniture and books and moved into a boarding house and then a hotel in Bayswater. After suffering what may have been a mild stroke she moved into a nursing home in Crawley, Sussex, and died there on 12 August 1945.<br>
