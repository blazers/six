<span class="headword">Hollis, Sir  (Alfred) Claud</span>  (1874&#150;1961), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 12 May 1874 at Cumberland Villa, Highgate Road, London, the second son of George Hollis (1843&#150;1919), a barrister of the Inner Temple, and his wife, Susannah Smith (1843&#150;1921). A pioneer of British administration in east Africa from the 1890s, he also served in Sierra Leone (1913&#150;16) and Trinidad (1930&#150;36). He was educated privately at St Leonards (to 1890) and in Switzerland (1891) and Germany (1892). In March 1897, after working for a commercial company in German East Africa (1893&#150;6), he was appointed assistant collector in the British East Africa Protectorate. He quickly made his mark, through his energetic work as a district officer at the coast, his linguistic ability&#151;he became government examiner in Swahili in 1901&#151;and his publications on local history and anthropology. Invited to join the staff of the commissioner and consul-general, Sir Arthur Hardinge, he was subsequently appointed private secretary to Hardinge's successor, Sir Charles Eliot, and to the new post of secretary to the protectorate administration.<br>
<br>Hollis took part in the expeditions to Jubaland (1900&#150;01) and against the Nandi (1905), receiving the Africa general service medal. His real concern, however, was the protection of African interests, especially from the demands for land and labour from incoming European settlers. Official recognition came in 1907 with his appointment as secretary for native affairs and membership of the legislative council. His pioneering and authoritative works on the Maasai (1905) and the Nandi (1908)&#151;to both of which Eliot contributed introductions&#151;received wide acclaim. Eliot's successor, Sir Donald Stewart, had little time for studious officials. He nevertheless appreciated Hollis's skills at shooting and cricket. Hollis's work continued to be commended by successive governors, Sir James Hayes-Sadler and Sir Percy Girouard. In 1911 he was appointed CMG, receiving congratulations from, among others, Winston Churchill, who had strongly supported Hollis in his defence of African interests when he visited the protectorate as under-secretary of state for the colonies in 1907.<br>
<br>Promotion came in January 1913, when Hollis took up the post of colonial secretary, Sierra Leone. Initially he was not accompanied by his wife, Enid Mabel Longman (1888&#150;1939), whom he had married on 17 September 1910 at St Michael's Church, Highgate. She followed later, leaving their small daughter, Christian Ainslie (<i>b</i>. 29 June 1911), with grandparents at Worthing. Enid was to prove a constant support, spending the majority of time with her husband overseas, while also caring for the family, first at Highgate and then at Bishops, Widdington, near Saffron Walden, Essex. Mark William was born on 25 April 1914 and Prunella on 8 April 1923.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, became a port of call for troopships from the south, as a result of which Hollis's responsibilities were greatly increased. But the tide of war in east Africa, following the defeat of German forces near Kilimanjaro, led to Hollis's recall. He became secretary to the administrator of the occupied territory of German East Africa and in 1920, chief secretary in the newly created Tanganyika territory, and was made CBE in 1919. Further promotion came in 1924 when he became British resident in Zanzibar. These years proved enjoyable and constructive. He developed cordial relations with the sultan and with leaders of the local community, concentrating on road and harbour improvements and also assisting schools, dispensaries, and the local clove farmers. In January 1927 he was appointed KCMG (promoted GCMG in 1934).<br>
<br>In 1930 Hollis was made governor of Trinidad, a post he held until his retirement in 1936. In addition to dispensing generous hospitality to numerous guests, he concentrated on improving Trinidad's lot in the years following the great depression. Major public works, installing a central water supply scheme, an electricity scheme, and work on a deep water harbour all contributed significantly to economic recovery. &#145;In spite of &hellip; difficulties&#146;, wrote a historian of Trinidad, &#145;Sir Claud Hollis appears to have been one of the Colony's most popular Governors&#146;  (Craig, 48).<br>
<br>Hollis's early years of retirement, though fully occupied with a range of activities including membership of the imperial communications advisory committee, were marked with sadness. His devoted wife Enid died in 1939 at the early age of fifty-one and his only son, Mark, was killed in action in 1941. He nevertheless remained active for many years, serving as a JP and as master of the Leathersellers' Company (1945&#150;6), and enjoying English country life. He died, aged eighty-seven, on 22 November 1961, at the Evelyn Nursing Home in Cambridge.<br>
