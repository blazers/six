<span class="headword">Thompson,  Thomas</span>  (1708/9&#150;1773), <span class="occ">missionary and apologist for the African slave trade</span>, was born at Gilling, Yorkshire, the son of William Thompson, possibly the same William Thompson who was curate and schoolmaster at Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland, from 1697. He was educated at Richmond School and matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 19 February 1728, aged nineteen. He became a scholar of the college that year, proceeded BA in 1732 and MA in 1735, and was elected a fellow in 1738. Having been appointed to a college curacy at Fen Drayton near Cambridge on 5 May 1744, he resigned after a few months to serve as a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) and in 1745 was given charge of the churches in Monmouth county, New Jersey. He found them unsettled, many of the members lapsed or become dissenters, and over the next five years worked to revive the scattered congregations, baptizing, and getting derelict churches rebuilt. Sometimes, with the consent of their owners, he baptized household slaves, and admitted them to communion. He also occasionally encountered the indigenous people in their &#145;native Heathenism&#146;  (Thompson, <span class="italic">An Account</span>, 19).<br>
<br>Feeling that he had fulfilled his mission in America, he asked the SPG to send him as a missionary to west Africa, &#145;that I might go to make a Trial with the Natives, and see what Hopes there would be of introducing among them the Christian Religion&#146;  (Thompson, <span class="italic">An Account</span>, 23). With the society's approval, granted on 15 February 1751, he crossed the Atlantic to Cape Coast Castle on the Gold Coast, the headquarters of the Royal African Company, as the first Church of England missionary to Africa.<br>
<br>Thompson also officiated as the company's chaplain, lived in the fort, and preached to the surrounding townspeople. But though he found them friendly, and at first attentive to his message, which had to be conveyed through uninstructed interpreters, they soon lost interest. None were ever converted. So instead he chose three boys to be sent to England for education, one of whom, Philip Quaque, was eventually to return as a missionary. In 1756 he resigned on health grounds and returned to parish work. He became vicar of Reculver in Kent in 1757, of Darenth in 1758, of Hoo St Werburgh in 1759, and moved to the living of Eleham, also in Kent, in 1761.<br>
<br>Thompson published in 1758 <span class="italic">An Account of Two Missionary Voyages</span>, a lively narrative of his experiences. Then, when the abolition campaign began, he seems to have been asked by his former employers to write in their defence. As he had been for five years the employee of a company which was principally concerned with trading in slaves, and had associated in an always perfectly amicable way with their African suppliers and customers, it need be no surprise that he was ready to publish, in 1772, a thirty-one page pamphlet, <span class="italic">The African trade for negro slaves shown to be consistent with principles of humanity and with the laws of revealed religion</span>. He drew on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to justify slavery, and also on African practice, remarking that: &#145;The customs of the blacks are many of them good rules of policy, such as would not disgrace a more regular constitution&#146;  (Thompson, <span class="italic">The African Trade</span>, 25). His pamphlet elicited a few pages of angry retort from Granville Sharp, beginning: &#145;For shame, Mr Thompson!&#146;  (Sharp, 29), incorporated in his <span class="italic">The Just Limitation of Slavery</span> (1776).<br>
<br>Thompson, who had been elected a member of the SPG in 1770, died at Eleham, Kent, on 5 June 1773.<br>
