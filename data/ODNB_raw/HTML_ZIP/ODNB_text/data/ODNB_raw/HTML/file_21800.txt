<span class="headword">Pelham, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1587), <span class="occ">lord justice of Ireland</span>, was the third son of Sir William Pelham (<i>d</i>. 1538), a landowner of Laughton, Sussex, and his second wife, Mary, daughter of William Sandys, Lord Sandys. The younger William Pelham married twice. With his first wife, Lady Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1574), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19939/', "Henry Neville, fifth earl of Westmorland")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19953/', "Neville, Ralph")</script>], he had two sons, William and Peregrine, and a daughter, Ann. His heir, yet another Sir William Pelham, married Ann, eldest daughter of Charles, Lord Willoughby of Parham. Perhaps by 1576 the second Sir William had remarried. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95013/', "Lady Dorothy Pelham (d. 1613)")</script> was the daughter of Anthony Catesby of Whiston, Northamptonshire, and widow of Sir William Dormer; this second marriage was childless.<br>
<br>His father died in 1538, and the second William Pelham was probably thirty years old when appointed captain of the pioneers at the siege of Leith in 1560 where he was specially commended for valour. According to Humphrey Barwick's <span class="italic">Brief Discourse</span> (<i>c</i>.1594) it was Pelham's faulty engineering which was responsible for the wound inflicted on Arthur Grey, fourteenth Lord Grey of Wilton. Pelham commanded the pioneers at Le Havre under the earl of Warwick in November 1562, and in February 1563 he helped Admiral Coligny in the capture of Caen. In March he returned to Le Havre but in July he was wounded in a skirmish with the forces of the Rhinegrave. He then assisted in negotiations for the surrender of Le Havre, and became a pledge or hostage for the fulfilment of the surrender terms at the treaty of Troyes in April 1564.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Pelham was employed by Portinari and Concio in improving the fortifications at Berwick. The privy council was so impressed with his competency and good judgement that he was promoted lieutenant-general of the ordnance, and in that capacity was occupied for several years in strengthening the defences of the realm. In the summer of 1578 he accompanied William, Lord Cobham, and the chief secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham, on a diplomatic mission to the Netherlands. The following summer Pelham was sent to Ireland to organize the defences of the pale when the rebellion of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1579) threatened to spread from Munster; meanwhile, many of the sub-septs of the northern families united against the territorial ambitions of Turlough Luineach O'Neill. Pelham was knighted by Sir William Drury on 14 September 1579 and, on the latter's death on 3 October, was elected lord justice of Ireland.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of fitz Maurice's rebellion in Munster and the subsequent threats from Gerald Fitzgerald, fifteenth earl of Desmond, and his brothers Sir James and Sir John of Desmond, the disturbed state of the province drove Pelham to action. When his efforts at conciliation and those of the countess of Desmond proved futile he caused the earl of Desmond to be proclaimed a traitor on 2 November 1579. He wrote to the queen on 4 November: &#145;Ormond [Thomas Butler, tenth earl] has already drawn blood and kindled fire in the midst of Desmond's country. I have left the prosecution of the war to him&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 164). Pelham did not have sufficient cannon to attack Askeaton, the chief seat of the Desmonds on the Shannon, so he went with the governor of Connaught, Sir Nicholas Malby, on a tour of his province and thence back to Dublin. The queen, reluctant to engage in yet another costly campaign, was much displeased with Pelham's and Malby's harsh proceedings, and it became common knowledge by the end of November 1579 that she wanted Lord Grey of Wilton to be her lord deputy of Ireland. Pelham, smarting under the queen's displeasure, pleaded that the proclamation against Desmond was an absolute necessity, and &#145;because of your several causes of your disliking with me since I entered into this service&#146;, as he wrote to the queen on 15 December, he once again petitioned &#145;to be speedily discharged from this government&#146;  (ibid., 183).<br>
<br>When it became apparent that Ormond's resources were unequal to the task of quelling Desmond the queen ameliorated her severity towards Pelham and encouraged him to repair into Munster, where he signed a patent to permit Sir Warham St Leger the exercise of martial law (11 January 1580). Rumours of a further Spanish invasion drove him to entrust the coastal counties of Cork and Waterford to Sir William Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1584). Accompanied by the earl of Ormond's forces, he then marched towards the Dingle peninsula, &#145;to make as bare a country as ever Spaniard put his foot in, if he intend to make that his landing place&#146;, as he wrote to the privy council. In the same letter he expressed his admiration for his soldiers: &#145;if I have any judgment, all the soldiers of Christendom must give place to that of the soldier of Ireland&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 219&#150;20). According to Irish reports, particularly that of the four masters, Pelham's Munster campaign was ruthless in &#145;killing blind and feeble men, women, boys and girls, sick persons, idiots and old people&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>). On 27 March 1580 he assaulted Carrigafoyle Castle, sparing neither man, woman, nor child. Desmond's main fortress of Askeaton then surrendered without resistance, and Newcastle, Rathkeale, Ballyduff, and Ballilogher fell into Pelham's hands at the same time.<br>
<br>During the campaign Sir Nicholas Malby had fallen out with Pelham, as had Pelham with the earl of Ormond. Pelham's aim of confining the war to co. Kerry meant containing Desmond by well-planted garrisons and co-operating with Admiral Winter's fleet to starve out Desmond's rebel support. He encountered many difficulties in getting victuals for his soldiers from the neighbouring gentry, and even among the better disposed Pelham found such a settled hatred of English government and lack of local co-operation that it became clear that only full-scale warfare would save Ireland for the crown. After delays both Pelham and Ormond entered co. Kerry together. At Castleisland they narrowly missed capturing Desmond and Nicholas Sander on 15 June 1580. Then they scoured the valley of the Maine and the Dingle peninsula and, with Admiral Winter's help, ransacked every cove and creek between there and Cork. Meanwhile Ormond harried the interior of co. Kerry, where he received the submission of many of Desmond's western chiefs before retiring in triumph to his own lands in Kilkenny. Pelham held a general meeting at Cork of all the lords and chiefs on 4 July 1580, receiving all to mercy except Lord Barrymore, and on the advice of Sir Warham St Leger took them all to his headquarters at Limerick.<br>
<br>To Desmond, now a fugitive in the Kerry mountains, unconditional surrender alone was offered. Although the war against Desmond was drawing to a close, Pelham was aware of the serious consequences of a Spanish invasion, particularly as the uprising of James Eustace, Viscount Baltinglass, in Leinster in July 1580 threw the general peace of Ireland into uncertainty. On 27 July he once again tendered his resignation to the queen: &#145;to be disburthened of this place is the greatest happiness that could light unto me&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 282). Pelham was preparing a fresh expedition into co. Kerry when he had news that Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton had landed on 12 August 1580 as the new lord deputy, together with his secretary, Edmund Spenser. Sir Henry Wallop was to present the sword of state to Lord Grey. Pelham took offence at the lack of deference shown him by Secretary Spenser, and determined to go himself to Dublin. Nevertheless, he had expressed willingness to serve under Grey. He was delayed at Athlone by bad weather and it was not until 7 September 1580 that Pelham formally resigned the sword of state to the new deputy in St Patrick's, Dublin. There was a rumour that Pelham would be made president of Munster. He accompanied Grey to Drogheda to inspect the fortifications there; but being taken dangerously ill, he went back to Dublin and sought permission to return to England. He left Ireland early in October.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1581 Pelham was joined in commission with George Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, and Sir Henry Neville to escort Mary, queen of Scots, from Sheffield to Ashby in Leicestershire. Though he was still lieutenant-general of the ordnance, by 1585 his expenses exceeded the profits of that office by &pound;8000; and at the same time his personal debts were in excess of &pound;5000. The queen refused to remit or even postpone that portion of his debts for which he was found personally responsible and made the payments of arrears an essential condition before allowing Pelham to serve under Leicester in the Netherlands. Pelham pleaded in vain: &#145;If you will not ease me of my debts, pray take my poor living into your possession, and give order for their payment, and imprest me some convenient sum to set me forward&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Both Lord Burghley and Leicester pressed the queen to relent; she went so far as to accept a mortgage on Pelham's properties, an arrangement which permitted him to accompany Leicester to the Netherlands in July 1586.<br>
<br>To the chagrin of the Norris brothers, Sir John and Sir Edward of Rycote, Oxfordshire, a prominent military family in Ireland and the Netherlands, Leicester made Pelham marshal of the army. At a drunken brawl in Count Hohenlohe's quarters at Gertruydenberg on 6 August 1586, Pelham nearly cost Sir Edward Norris his life, but Leicester put the blame on Norris. A few days later, inspecting the defences before Doesburg in Leicester's company, Pelham took a shot in the stomach while shielding his commander-in-chief. Thinking his wound to be fatal Pelham made &#145;comfortable and resolute speeches&#146; and deemed himself fortunate to have saved Leicester. However, he was fated &#145;to carry a bullet in his belly&#146;, for he lived to participate in the celebrated siege of Zutphen in September 1586 where Sir Philip Sidney was mortally wounded. According to Fulke Greville, it was imitation of Pelham's chivalry that cost Sidney his life under the walls of Zutphen. When the garrison of Deventer under Sir William Stanley of Hooton in the Wirral betrayed the fortress and town to the Spaniards, Pelham had the task of quelling the mutiny, which he accomplished in summary and resolute fashion. In April 1587 Pelham returned to England with Leicester and took the waters at Bath to recover from his ailments. By autumn he was fit enough to go back to the Netherlands with reinforcements, but he died on 24 November 1587, shortly after landing at Flushing. In his will, which was puritan in tone, he had requested burial at the discretion of his executors should he die in England. In the event his place of burial went unrecorded.<br>
<br>Pelham's letter-book, which contains both a diary and his extensive official correspondence when lord justice of Ireland, is preserved among the Carew manuscripts in Lambeth Palace Library. The original compilation by Morgan Colman, Pelham's secretary, has an elaborately decorated title page, and consists of 455 folios. Pelham composed commendatory verses and these are prefixed to Sir George Peckham's <span class="italic">A True Reporte of the Late Discoveries &hellip; of the Newfound Landes</span> of 1583. He also wrote a tract entitled &#145;A form or maner howe to have the exersyse of the harquebuse thorowe England for the better defence of the same&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 12/44/60). He collaborated in 1580 with Sir Henry Wallop and Sir Edward Waterhouse in writing a scheme for the government of Munster; although Pelham's contribution was mainly military, his plan also included ideas on taxation. The oil portrait of him in the earl of Yarborough's collection is attributed to Cornelius Ketel and seems to have been painted about 1580. Another portrait of Sir William Pelham, by an unknown artist, last appeared at Christies on 31 January 1968.<br>
