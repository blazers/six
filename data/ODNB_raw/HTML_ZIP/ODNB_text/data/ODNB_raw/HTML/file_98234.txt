<span class="headword">Quennell,  Charles Henry Bourne</span>  (1872&#150;1935), <span class="occ">architect and writer</span>, was born on 5 June 1872 at 44 Lower Kennington Lane, Lambeth, London, the eldest of the four sons and one daughter of Henry Quennell (1843&#150;1926), a builder from Kennington, south London, and his wife, Emma Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hobbs (1842&#150;1921), a school proprietor. He was privately educated and in 1890 began a three-year architectural training articled to the practice of Newman and Newman and working as an assistant for Messrs Yett and Sturdy. Between 1893 and 1896 he worked for the practice of J. M. Brydon and J. D. Sedding, followed by that of Henry Wilson. He simultaneously attended evening classes at South Kensington, where he obtained the national gold medal for architectural design, as well as a silver medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, in 1895. In 1896 he started his own practice at 17 Victoria Street, Westminster, and began his career designing arts and crafts furniture for J. P. White of Bedford.<br>
<br>Quennell's first architectural work was in the affluent suburbs of London, where he designed houses for the builder G. W. Hart, with whom he created the West Hampstead estate (1896&#150;1914). He later built about sixteen large houses at Hampstead Garden Suburb both before and after the First World War. He subsequently worked for Hart in Bickley, near Bromley, Kent, where he had moved soon after his marriage on 19 May 1904 to <a href="#cosubject_98234">Marjorie Courtney [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and designed picturesque medium-sized &#145;free style&#146; houses. Quennell's work on the West Hampstead estate is notable for the range of scales it encompassed and for his techniques for introducing variety without creating visual confusion. In his later developments, particularly the Denewood estate in Highgate, north London, of 1920 onwards (for his brother Walter, a builder), the neo-Georgian dominated and a more uniform feel prevailed.<br>
<br>By 1910 Quennell had established a successful practice and was participating in &eacute;lite events like the international RIBA town planning conference, at which he delivered a paper on &#145;Town planning and land tenure&#146;. He was unusual among architects in giving consideration to such issues. They arose partly from his historical interests and also from his experiences of working in the commercial world of speculative building. The conference exposed Quennell to the latest thinking in architecture and town planning in North America and Europe, providing an internationalist approach for which he became increasingly renowned. Quennell went on to become a respected and well-known figure in the architectural establishment, serving as an elected member of the RIBA council (1912&#150;15) as well as on its board of architectural education (1928&#150;30) and its town planning committee (1914&#150;25).<br>
<br>Besides his speculative building work Quennell developed a portfolio of individual commissions before the First World War, of which the best known is Aultmore House, Inverness (1913). He also designed a number of churches and schools that demonstrate his architectural versatility and eclecticism, including the Byzantine-style Campbell mausoleum at St Mary's Roman Catholic cemetery, Hammersmith (1904); the innovative neo-Gothic church of St John, Upper Edmonton (1905&#150;6), inspired by Westminster Cathedral; and the neo-Georgian Mowden School in Brighton (1912).<br>
<br>One of Quennell's most important pre-war domestic commissions was for the window manufacturer Francis Henry Crittall. He went on to co-design, with Francis's son Walter, the Clockhouse Way estate in Braintree, Essex (1918&#150;20). The scheme consisted of sixty-five flat-roofed concrete workers' houses, the first in the country, built using an experimental standardized-unit construction system with no wood and with windows and doors of steel. In 1925 Crittalls built another &#145;model village&#146; of 500 houses at Silver End, outside Braintree, now best known for its modern-movement houses by Thomas Tait and Frederick MacManus for Crittall family members and executives. However, two-thirds of the estate was designed in a stripped-down neo-Georgian brick idiom by Quennell and C. Murray Hennell. Quennell's shift towards a new form of modern Georgian can be seen in one of his last buildings, a neo-Palladian villa, 18 Frognal Way, Hampstead (1930).<br>
<br>From the beginning of his career Quennell wrote books, the earliest being a <span class="roman">Bell's Guide</span>, <span class="italic">The Cathedral Church of Norwich</span> (1898). <span class="italic">Modern Suburban Houses</span> (1906) was the first written evidence of his desire to reconcile the traditional and the progressive in domestic design. He went further in 1912 in his essay &#145;The case for modern furniture&#146; in Lawrence Weaver's <span class="italic">The House and its Equipment</span>, in which he compared furniture design to car manufacture. This marks out Quennell, along with William Richard Lethaby, as one of the first British advocates of an industrialized approach to architecture in the pre-war period. Quennell became an enthusiastic proponent and acknowledged expert on the new production methods, visiting the Ford motor plant in Detroit.<br>
<br>Charles Quennell's best-known works were those he co-wrote with his wife, the <span class="occ">artist and writer</span> <a name="cosubject_98234"></a><span class="headword">Marjorie Quennell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Courtney]</span></span>  (1883&#150;1972). Born on 14 September 1883 at The Elms, 76 Masons Hill, Bromley, Kent, Marjorie was the elder of the two daughters among the seven children of Allen Courtney (<i>b</i>. 1843/4), merchant and later woollen warehouseman, and his wife, Clara Kezia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Toswell 
    (or Tosswell; 1852&#150;1896)
  . She was educated at Oakhurst School, Shortlands, Beckenham, Kent, and attended various art schools. She and Charles Quennell had three children, of whom the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53167/', "Peter Quennell")</script>, became a noted author and poet, and whose autobiography, <span class="italic">The Marble Foot</span> (1976), provides the best introduction to the family. The couple's second son, Paul, born in June 1915, was killed in Belgium in 1940, while a daughter, Gillian, born in September 1909, pre-deceased her mother. The family lived first at Bickley, near Bromley, and then moved, about 1919, to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Charles and Marjorie Quennell are best known for their joint publication <span class="italic">A History of Everyday Things</span> (1918&#150;34), a ground-breaking work for children that in four volumes covered the period from 1066 to 1934. The volumes were pioneering in their emphasis on social rather than political history and for dealing with how people &#145;passed their time; the kind of work they did, the things they used&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of Everyday Things</span>, 1.viii). The work was wholly collaborative in both the extensive research undertaken and the production of the illustrations. The latter were central to the books in stimulating the imagination, which the Quennells felt essential for children's understanding and pleasure. Writing in 1936 Frank Roscoe of the Royal Society of Teachers credited the Quennells with inventing the modern teaching of history in British schools, claiming it was &#145;hardly too much to say that they made history while writing it&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Note on the Methods and Influence of C. H. B. and Marjorie Quennell on History Teaching in Schools</span>, 1936). The book went through multiple re-issues and editions and remained in print until the 1970s, by which time over a million copies had been sold.<br>
<br>Charles Quennell died on 5 December 1935 of arteriosclerosis at the couple's home, Crabtrees, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and was cremated on 7 December at Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex. Earlier that year Marjorie Quennell had been appointed the first curator of the Geffrye Museum, in Shoreditch, east London. By that date London county council, which ran the museum, wanted to make it available to a wider public, particularly schoolchildren. Marjorie was responsible for rearranging the collection into its famous period room sequence and painted the dummy boards used to represent the costume of each period. So successful was she that by 1939 there was a staff of three &#145;giving four or five children's lectures daily&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 March 1939). Under Marjorie's supervision the Geffrye's purpose became that of <span class="italic">Everyday Things</span>: &#145;to try and show in some measure the growth of English life&#146;  (M. Quennell, &#145;The Geffrye Museum, Kingsland Road, E.&#146;, <span class="italic">Apollo</span>, 27 Jan 1938, 11). The museum's closure for the war in 1941 came a year after the death in action of her favourite son, Paul, after which Marjorie left for the United States. She later returned to England but never resumed her museum activities, though she continued to work on revised editions of <span class="italic">Everyday Things</span> through the 1940s and 1950s. She was appointed the first female honorary associate member of the RIBA in 1938. Marjorie Quennell died after a long illness on 2 August 1972 at her home, 6 Wallands Crescent, Lewes, Sussex.<br>
