<span class="headword">La Cloche,  Jacques  de</span>  (1644/1647?&#150;1669), <span class="occ">pretended son of Charles II</span>, may have come from Jersey, but nothing is known of his early life or true parentage. He claimed to be the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II (1630&#150;1685)")</script> and he named a woman in his will as &#145;Dona Maria Stuarda, della famiglia delli baroni di S. Marzo&#146;. According to La Cloche, her &#145;nearness and greatness of blood was the cause &hellip; that his Majestie would never acknowledge him&#146;  (Kent, letters to Joseph Williamson, TNA: PRO, SP 85.10, fol. 111). Whom La Cloche meant by this is unclear, but Lady Mary Stuart, duchess of Richmond and Lennox and countess of March (1622&#150;1685) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56054/', "Villiers, Mary")</script>], has been suggested. A previous identification of his mother as Marguerite de Carteret (1625&#150;1713) of Jersey, who in 1656 married Jean de La Cloche, son of &Eacute;tienne de La Cloche, rector of St Ouen, seems improbable. The first contemporary notice of La Cloche occurred when he was admitted to the Jesuit novitiate in Sant' Andrea al Quirinale, Rome, the register of novices recording the admission on 11 November 1668 of Jacobus de La Cloche, from the island of Jersey, aged twenty-four.<br>
<br>La Cloche brought with him apparently significant documents whose authenticity, however, is disputed. Two, purporting to have been signed and sealed by Charles II, recognized La Cloche as his son. A third, supposedly supplied by Queen Kristina of Sweden, also certified La Cloche's paternity. Further letters, dated in August 1668 and seemingly by Charles II, were sent to Father Oliva, general of the Jesuits. These also acknowledged La Cloche's royal paternity and suggested that La Cloche come to London and begin negotiations for Charles II's conversion to Roman Catholicism. Father Oliva may have been convinced as, following his instructions, on 14 or 15 October 1668 La Cloche began a journey to London, going at least as far as Paris in the company of a Jesuit priest. Whether he reached London is unverified, but he returned to Rome, apparently with another letter from Charles, dated 18 November, which promised a donation and compensation for La Cloche's expenses.<br>
<br>Tiredness from the journey and the rigours of winter had undermined La Cloche's health. He therefore decided to delay another journey to London and await milder temperatures. Perhaps on the advice of Oliva, he transferred to Naples. Finding accommodation at the home of Francesco Corona, a poor but respectable gentleman, and his wife, Annuccia d'Amicij, Jacques fell hopelessly in love with his hosts' daughter Teresa, and married her in Naples Cathedral on 19 February 1669, styling himself Giacomo Enrico de Boveri Roano Stuardo, not before giving his father-in-law money and jewels in such quantity as to arouse suspicion that he was in reality a counterfeiter. Indeed, in early March, as he himself related in two letters to Cardinal Francesco Barberini dated 6 and 10 April 1669, he was arrested by order of the Spanish viceroy of Naples, Don Pedro of Aragon, and confined in the castle of Sant'Elmo, from where on 20 March he was transferred to the fortress of Gaeta. Among the papers confiscated from him emerged two certificates attesting his royal parentage, one apparently signed by Kristina of Sweden, the other by Father Oliva. In Naples excitement grew about the English prince and the new princess, referred to as La Reginella. The news may have reached England for it seems that Charles II wrote to the viceroy denouncing the prisoner as an impostor. La Cloche was soon released, perhaps through the intervention of the cardinal and Father Oliva. He hoped to take his family to Venice but a violent fever ended his life. He died on 26 August 1669, and was buried in the church of San Francesco di Paola, outside Porta Capuana. In La Cloche's extravagant and pretentious will he named Louis XIV executor, whom he called &#145;Cousin&#146;.<br>
<br>On 10 December (or 11 November) 1669 a son, Giacomo, was born posthumously to Jacques de La Cloche and baptized the same day in the parish church of Santa Sofia. Giacomo lived in Naples until 1708, when he left for Rome, where he married D. Lucia Minelli della Riccia. On 4 October 1711, for this marriage, he was arrested as a vagabond and impostor by Pope Clement XI and tried by the Roman court for an entire year, until he was recognized as a genuine descendant of Charles II. In this capacity he was welcomed by numerous Italian and European courts, and he wandered from one to another, begging respect and munificence. He died in Naples in 1752 or 1753. It seems he was survived by a son, Giuseppe (1722&#150;1783), who resided at the court of France, and has been said to have acted as a double for Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, when he was away on secret missions. He was apparently the last of the line.<br>
