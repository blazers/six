<span class="headword">Veysey <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Harman]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1464&#150;1554), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was the eldest son of William Harman (<i>d</i>. 1470) of Moor (or More) Hall, Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1525), daughter of Henry Squier of Handsworth, Staffordshire. After an unknown schooling, he followed the arts course at Oxford in the early 1480s, took a BA degree, was admitted as a probationary fellow of Magdalen College on 27 July 1486, and became a full fellow one year later. He subsequently studied civil law, graduating as bachelor by 1489 and doctor by 1495. He left Magdalen in 1496, was presented to the rectory of Clifton Reynes in Buckinghamshire, and took holy orders as subdeacon, deacon, and priest between March 1497 and March 1498. His adoption of the surname Veysey dates from about this time, perhaps as a compliment to John Veysey (<i>d</i>. 1492), an Oxford graduate and London city rector, who came from the west midlands and whose will made bequests to Harman and to his brother.<br>
<br>After leaving Magdalen, Veysey enjoyed the patronage of John Arundell, bishop of his home diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, who gave him the rectory of Edgmond, Shropshire, in 1497, made him his vicar-general by 1498, and promoted him as archdeacon of Chester in 1499. When Arundell was translated to the see of Exeter in 1502, Veysey joined him there as bishop's chancellor and vicar-general, further receiving from him a canonry and prebend of Exeter Cathedral and the archdeaconry of Barnstaple, all in 1503. After Arundell's death in the following year, Veysey continued as vicar-general under his successor, Hugh Oldham, who collated him as precentor of the cathedral in 1508. He also received other benefices at various times, including the rectories of St Mary's on the Hill, Chester, in 1499 and Stoke in Teignhead, Devon, in 1504, the latter a crown appointment. In 1506 he exchanged the Chester rectory for a canonry of Salisbury Cathedral, with the prebend of Alton Borealis.<br>
<br>Veysey's high reputation by 1507 is shown by his election as president of Magdalen College on 20 January. He resigned on 30 April before his installation (perhaps through inability to hold the office along with his other benefices), but a majority of the college fellows still expressed a preference for him at a subsequent election. In October 1509 he was chosen as dean of Exeter Cathedral by its canons, after Henry VIII had attempted to impose an outsider&#151;a circumstance that did not prevent his rise into royal favour. By 1514 he was dean of the Chapel Royal, and was made a canon and prebendary of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster. In 1515 Henry presented him to the deaneries of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and Wolverhampton, and in 1518 to the rectory of Meifod, in Montgomeryshire. Veysey supported the crown against the bishops in 1515 during the disputes about jurisdiction which followed the death of Richard Hunne, and argued the right of secular judges to try clergy in criminal cases. In 1519 the king secured his appointment as bishop of Exeter. The papal provision was issued on 31 August, the temporalities of the see were granted on 4 November, and the archbishop of Canterbury consecrated him at Otford, Kent, on the 6th.<br>
<br>Veysey began his episcopate by organizing a visitation of his diocese in the winter of 1514&#150;15. It was still in progress a year later and led to injunctions for the reform of the priories of Cornworthy in Devon and Tywardreath in Cornwall, and of the collegiate churches of Crediton and Ottery St Mary in Devon. Later, however, other concerns competed with his diocese for his attention. He became involved in diplomacy, accompanying the king to the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, welcoming the emperor Charles V to England in 1522, and greeting the pope's ambassador in 1524. In 1525 Henry made him president of the council in the marches of Wales, with the duty of supervising the household of Princess Mary (later Mary I), who was associated with the council as a royal representative. These duties often kept him in the marches, especially at Ludlow, until 1534, when, after being criticized for keeping poor order in Wales, he was replaced as president by Rowland Lee. He then returned to Devon and stayed there frequently until 1546. His episcopal register suggests that he ran his diocese efficiently, but without major initiatives or distinctive policies. Although he made a summary of the statutes of Exeter Cathedral, preserved in the register among material of 1541, this was mainly based on the legislation of previous bishops. He himself did little more than regulate the admission of residentiary canons and, at the request of the cathedral chapter, reduce from forty-six to thirty-six the number of days on which such canons had to reside each year.<br>
<br>The bishop was closely attached to his family and to his birthplace. He promoted his sisters' sons, John Gibbons (<i>d</i>. 1537) and William Leveson (<i>d</i>. 1582), to the chancellorship of Exeter Cathedral and, in Gibbons's case, to be his vicar-general. A third relative, William Veysey (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1545), was made apparitor-general of the diocese, a fourth, Henry Squier (<i>d</i>. 1582), archdeacon of Barnstaple, and another connection, James Leveson, farmed the revenues of the church of Wolverhampton. Veysey was also a notable benefactor of Sutton Coldfield. In 1528 he secured for the town royal grants of corporate status and of the nearby free chase and park, in return for an annual rent of &pound;58. He improved the parish church with new nave aisles, chancel chapels, organs, and a steeple. He gave a meadow to support fifteen poor widows and, between 1540 and 1543, endowed a free grammar school. He also built the moot hall and prison, laid out the market place, paved the town, gave pasturage in the chase to the local poor, erected fifty-one stone houses, and provided new bridges at Curdworth and Water Orton. Moor Hall was reconstituted as a brick house for his own residence, which passed after his death to John, the eldest son of his brother Hugh. He further attempted to establish the manufacture of Devonshire kerseys in Sutton, but this, according to his younger contemporary the Exeter historian John Hooker, &#145;in the end came to small effect&#146;  (Hooker, sigs. H2<i>v</i>&#150;I1<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Much that happened during the Reformation was probably unwelcome to Veysey. He issued an indulgence as late as 1536, and was rumoured to lack enthusiasm for change. His royal connections, however, kept him subservient to the crown, and he was dutiful in publicizing and enforcing its policies and edicts in his diocese, notably through a surviving set of injunctions in 1538. These are also noteworthy for instructing that children should be taught the Lord's prayer, Ave Maria, creed, and ten commandments either in English or in Cornish. Veysey complied, too, with requests from the royal court for leases of episcopal properties and, under Edward VI, demands for outright grants. As a result, the annual revenue of the bishopric of Exeter fell from &pound;1566 in 1535 to a notional &pound;500 in 1551. Serious unrest broke out in the diocese with the so-called western, or &#145;prayer-book&#146;, rebellion of 1549, and two years later the octogenarian bishop received a royal command to resign, which he obeyed on 1 August 1551. He was succeeded as bishop by Miles Coverdale, a staunch protestant, and remained chiefly at Sutton, until the accession of Mary I in July 1553 led to Coverdale's deprivation and his own restoration, his register of acts resuming on 10 September. Although about ninety years old, he visited his palace at Exeter in November and stayed there for nearly two months before returning to Sutton, where he died at Moor Hall in 1554 &#145;of a pang, going to his stoole yn the night tyme&#146;, according to Hooker  (Exeter City Archives, book 51, fol. 351<i>r</i>). An inquisition post mortem, taken in Staffordshire, dated his death as 22 October, but his episcopal register gave the 23rd. He was buried in the north chancel chapel which he had built in Sutton church, beneath an effigy depicting him in mass vestments with mitre and pastoral staff. The effigy survives on a later tomb chest.<br>
<br>Hooker, a protestant writing in the reign of Elizabeth I, characterized Veysey as &#145;a very wor[l]dly wyse man and yn greate credyte with the king and counsell &hellip; He was as courtelyk [that is, courtly] a man as no man exceaded hym in any courtlyk behaviour&#146;. Warwickshire tradition believed that he kept a retinue of 140 men in scarlet livery. His generosity is evident, as is his competence as an administrator, but he is less notable for originality or energy. Hooker (and some later writers) censured the grants of episcopal property which he made from the 1530s onwards. &#145;How well so ever he deserved of noble men and gentlemen, he deserved small commendement and thanckes of his church and bishopryk&#146;. This does insufficient justice to the pressures faced by post-Reformation bishops, which made Veysey's actions virtually unavoidable.<br>
