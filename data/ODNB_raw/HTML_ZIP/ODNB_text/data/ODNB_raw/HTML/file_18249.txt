<span class="headword">Mary</span> <span class="st"> [Mary of Gueldres]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1463), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of James II</span>, was probably born in Gueldres, the eldest daughter of Arnold, duke of Gueldres, and Catherine, duchess of Cleves. From an early age she enjoyed the support of her powerful uncle, Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, at whose court she was brought up. Scottish diplomatic success in finding prestigious European husbands for four of James II's sisters (in France, Brittany, Austria, and Veere) may have led to raised expectations on the part of the Scottish commissioners&#151;William, Lord Crichton, the chancellor, John Ralston, bishop of Dunkeld, and Nicholas Otterburn, official of St Andrews&#151;in their pursuit of a marriage alliance in Burgundy, Gueldres, and Cleves.<br>
<br>Negotiations appear to have been tough and protracted. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14588/', "James II (1430&#150;1460)")</script> enlisted the aid of his kinsman, Charles VII of France, as early as January 1448, and gave full powers to the Scottish ambassadors on 6 May. But it was not until 1 April 1449 that the marriage contract was finally drawn up at Brussels. The long delay was caused by the fact that Duke Arnold of Gueldres's original plan, drawn up on 6 September 1448, had been to marry his eldest daughter, Mary, to Duke Albrecht of Austria, brother of Friedrich, king of the Romans (Emperor Friedrich III), while Arnold's second daughter, Margaret, was to marry the Scottish king. Both marriages were to be negotiated by Philip of Burgundy. It seems likely that the final deal, whereby James II obtained the hand of Mary, was the result not so much of tough talking by the Scots commissioners as of an agreement between Philip of Burgundy, who was to pay Mary's dowry, and the Scottish king's ally Charles VII, who stood surety for the bride's Scottish dower (10,000 crowns) in the event of James II's death. Significantly the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed on 31 December 1448, during the course of the Burgundian negotiations which resulted in the treaty of Brussels.<br>
<br>Mary of Gueldres came to Scotland not only with the promise of a dowry of 60,000 gold crowns (to be paid over two years by Philip the Good), but also at the duke of Burgundy's expense, in a magnificent fleet of fourteen vessels which sailed from Sluys on 9 June 1449, reaching Leith on the 18th after a detour to visit the chapel of St Adrian on the Isle of May. The marriage treaty was duly ratified by James II a week later, and on 3 July James and Mary were married at Holyrood, with Mary's coronation taking place on the same day. The queen's dower lands included the lands of the earldoms of Strathearn and Atholl, the castle and lordship of Methven, and the palace of Linlithgow, as well as the great customs of the burgh of Linlithgow. These were supposed to yield the huge sum of 10,000 crowns, the equivalent of &pound;5000 Scots. The fact that this ambitious total was not even approached, taken together with James II's fear that Burgundy might withhold the substantial balance of Mary's dowry if an adequate Scottish dower was not forthcoming, probably played a role in the king's assault on the Livingston family in 1449&#150;50 and in his subsequent efforts to wrest the earldom of Wigtown from the Black Douglases. Significantly, the queen played a considerable role in the first parliament of James II's active rule, held in Edinburgh in January 1450. Not only did she back the Scottish bishops in their complaint to the crown that the estates of deceased prelates were being requisitioned by royal officers, but she also secured the widest possible support for the payment of her dower, assigned by the estates on the day after the axe fell on two of the forfeited Livingstons.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1450s Mary of Gueldres acted as a dutiful wife, providing her husband with four sons and two daughters. The most crucial period from the point of view of the continuing Stewart succession, however, came in the early 1450s. At Stirling on 19 May 1450 the queen gave premature birth to a child who lived only six hours; about a year later she had a daughter Mary; but no surviving male child was born to the royal couple until May 1452, by which time James II was embroiled in the greatest crisis of his reign and was forced to send his wife from the storm centre of Stirling to the comparative safety of the episcopal castle at St Andrews. There, towards the end of May 1452, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III")</script> was born. Further children followed: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26453/', "Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany and earl of March")</script>, most probably in 1454, David, earl of Moray, in 1456, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26484/', "John Stewart, earl of Mar")</script>, in 1457 or early 1458, and a second daughter, Margaret, in 1459&#150;60. With the exception of David, all these children survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>The sudden death of Mary's husband, James II, aged only twenty-nine, killed by the explosion of one of his own cannon at the siege of Roxburgh on 3 August 1460, ended the queen's lengthy preoccupation with childbirth and forced on her the new task of stateswoman, a role which she performed equally well during the last three years of her life. Within five days of James II's death the queen had brought her eldest son, the eight-year-old James III, to the siege; Roxburgh was taken, and the new king was crowned at Kelso on 10 August. A contemporary chronicler comments, albeit disapprovingly, that at the first parliament of the new reign (February 1461), the estates &#145;left the king in keping with his modere the queen and governing of all the kinrik&#146;  (McGladdery, 170). Mary lost no time in appointing her own men as keepers of the vital castles of Edinburgh, Stirling, Blackness, and Dunbar; and she made James Lindsay of Covington, a man mistrusted by her late husband because of his Douglas connections, keeper of the privy seal.<br>
<br>In foreign policy the queen dowager followed James II's line of playing off Lancaster and York in England in order to recover Scottish strong points on the borders. In this she was spectacularly successful. By offering sanctuary to the refugee Lancastrian king and queen, Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou, she was able to recover Berwick by negotiation in March 1461. When it became clear that the Lancastrian cause was lost in England, Mary of Gueldres switched to dealings with the Yorkist Edward IV; she paid large sums to be rid of Margaret of Anjou, sending her from Kirkcudbright to Brittany in April 1462 to seek French aid, while Queen Mary herself went to Dumfries to meet the Yorkist earl of Warwick. The queen's great rival, Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews, who was pro-French and Lancastrian by conviction, tried to upset Mary's more realistic inclination towards Burgundy and the Yorkists, partly by besmirching the queen's name through accusations of causing divisions and bloodshed, and ultimately by forcing her into an abortive raid on Norham Castle (July 1463). Mary died on 1 December 1463. Her legacy was the peace process with Yorkist England, into which even Kennedy was drawn after her death; the spectacular Fife castle of Ravenscraig, on which the queen spent at least &pound;600 Scots between 1460 and 1463; and Holy Trinity Church in Edinburgh, on which she lavished the huge sum of &pound;1100 Scots, and in which she was buried in December 1463. Stories that circulated in later generations, alleging that Queen Mary had been the mistress successively of Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1471), and Adam Hepburn, without much doubt originated in confusion with another maligned queen mother, James I's widow, Joan.<br>
