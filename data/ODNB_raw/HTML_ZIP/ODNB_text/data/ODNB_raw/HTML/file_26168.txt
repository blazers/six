<span class="headword">Spottiswoode,  John, of that ilk</span>  (1667&#150;1728), <span class="occ">lawyer and jurist</span>, was born on 28 November 1667, the son of Alexander Spottiswoode (1636&#150;1675), advocate, designated of Crumstaine in right of his first wife, Isobel, daughter of Sir John Home of Crumstaine in Berwickshire, and his second wife, Helen, seventh daughter of John Trotter of Mortonhall. Alexander Spottiswoode had a son, Alexander, by his first marriage, who died unmarried. The family had distinguished antecedents: Alexander Spottiswoode was the son of Sir Robert Spottiswood, Lord New Abbey, senator and then president of the college of justice, executed for treason in 1646, and the grandson of John Spottiswoode, archbishop of St Andrews, lord chancellor of Scotland, and extraordinary lord of session, of the old Berwickshire family of Spottiswoode of that ilk. Alexander's brother Robert was a doctor of medicine, who served in the army with the British garrison at Tangier; Robert's son, another Alexander, ultimately became governor of Virginia.<br>
<br>Initially schooled in Crumstaine, Spottiswoode attended the Latin school at Duns and then, from 1677, Kelso School, learning Latin and some Greek. From 1683 to 1686 he attended the University of Edinburgh under the regent Herbert Kennedy, though taking classes in mathematics from the famous Newtonian David Gregory. After graduation Spottiswoode was apprenticed on 15 December 1686 to James Hay of Carriber, writer to the signet, in his apprentice's view &#145;the ablest Conveyancer of the last Age&#146;  (J. Spottiswoode, <span class="italic">Introduction to the Knowledge of the Style of Writs</span>, 1708, sig. a2<i>r</i>). Though indented for three years Spottiswoode stayed with Hay until 1692, when, having determined to become an advocate, he left for Leiden in the Netherlands, where he studied law with Gerard Noodt and Ph. R. Vitriarius and chemistry with Jacob Le Mort. He returned to Scotland in January 1694 and was finally admitted advocate on 24 December 1696.<br>
<br>Lying behind much of Spottiswoode's conduct was a determination to restore the fortunes of his family and ensure once more its landed rank, which the vicissitudes of the seventeenth century had affected so badly. With much effort he reacquired the barony of Spottiswoode; he sought unsuccessfully to involve his cousin Alexander, the future governor, in reacquiring the barony of Dairsie (which had belonged to the archbishop); and he sought from the crown the re-grant of New Abbey (which his grandfather had been compelled to resign to the crown to endow the newly erected bishopric of Edinburgh in return for a promise of &pound;3000, which had never been paid but which the crown had kept after the re-establishment of presbyterianism in 1690). Although parliament recognized Spottiswoode's rights to New Abbey in 1695, it was not re-granted by the crown in his lifetime. He finally purchased the superiority of Spottiswoode in February 1700, and, after his infeftment in the lands and barony in March, thereafter proudly styled himself John Spottiswoode of that ilk, although in 1724 he was still involved in litigation relating to the acquisition.<br>
<br>Spottiswoode's account books suggest that he was soon making enough to live in a relatively simple but gentlemanly fashion from his practice at the bar. Yet for someone with such ambitions to restore the family fortune, money must have been a scarce commodity. In 1698 he had thought of offering private classes to the apprentices of writers; he was certainly fascinated by the styles of legal documents, perhaps stimulating his antiquarian interests. In 1701 he decided to offer classes in Scots law and civil (Roman) law, which he started to teach in 1702. His classes on Scots law covered the form of process, the styles of documents, and the substance of the law. The first two of these led to his publishing <span class="italic">Introduction to the Knowledge of the Style of Writs</span> (1708) and <span class="italic">The Form of Process, before the Lords of Council and Session</span> (1711), both of which went through several editions. He relied on Sir George Mackenzie's <span class="italic">Institutions of the Law of Scotland</span> to teach the substance of the law, publishing an edition with notes deriving from his classes in 1723. In Roman law he taught a course on Justinian's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, using as his textbook B&ouml;ckelmann's <span class="italic">Compendium Institutionum Justiniani</span>. Spottiswoode's classes were initially very successful (his pupils included Duncan Forbes of Culloden), but he seems to have stopped teaching between 1706 and 1710, because of the success of a rival private teacher. After 1710 he taught only his classes on Scots law, probably teaching most years until 1722. Again his classes were successful.<br>
<br>Active in the Faculty of Advocates, Spottiswoode served as clerk of faculty (1697&#150;1702, 1703&#150;6) and keeper of the library (1702&#150;28), Thomas Ruddiman being his under-keeper. He was also appointed in 1724 to a committee of the faculty to consider the examination of all intrants on Scots law. He also maintained a regular practice, the most noted case in which he was involved being the trial of Captain Green and the crew of the <i>Worcester</i> before the court of Admiralty. The trial was a popular event in the politically charged years before the Union, and Spottiswoode's defence raised strong feelings against him&#151;particularly troubling to one much given to introspective self-examination.<br>
<br>Growing success led Spottiswoode in 1710 to marry Helen Arbuthnott (1675&#150;1741), widow of John MacFarlane of Arrochar (younger of that ilk), and daughter of Robert, second Viscount Arbuthnott, and his second wife, Katherine Gordon. The couple had four children: John, the heir (1711&#150;1793); Robert (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1711/12); Helen, who married John Gartshore of Alderston; and Anne, who married James Dundas. Spottiswoode was at one time close to the famous historian and antiquary James Anderson, sharing the historical and patriotic concerns of those grouped around Sir Robert Sibbald; indeed he compiled <span class="italic">An Account of All the Religious Houses that were in Scotland at the Time of the Reformation</span> (published posthumously with his edition of Sir Thomas Hope's <span class="italic">Minor Practicks</span> (1734)). He also briefly ran a printing house. As well as a number of more ephemeral works linked to his teaching and other endeavours, including pamphlets on an election, the Union debate, and the scandal over the Jacobite medal that Henrietta, duchess of Gordon, tried to present to the faculty, he also edited and published in one volume Gilmore's and Falconer's collections of decisions of the session (1701) and his own grandfather's <span class="italic">Practicks</span> (1706). These last publications obviously reflected his ambitions in the faculty and his pride in his ancestry. His short work <span class="italic">Law of Elections</span> in 1710 was an evident <i>pi&egrave;ce d'occasion</i>, though reflecting his teaching to some extent. He collected a substantial library, and 2982 items were auctioned after his death.<br>
<br>The appointment of his pupil Alexander Bayne as professor of Scots law in the University of Edinburgh in 1722 probably led Spottiswoode to end teaching. He also seems now to have played little part in the running of the Advocates' Library, though still keeper, but he did maintain a practice before the session. He died in Edinburgh on 13 February 1728, having played by his example a major part in the successful re-establishment of legal education in the Scottish universities, though he never gained the chair to which he had once aspired.<br>
