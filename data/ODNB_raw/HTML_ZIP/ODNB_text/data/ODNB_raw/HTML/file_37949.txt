<span class="headword">Shanks,  James</span>  (1800&#150;1867), <span class="occ">chemical engineer</span>, was born on 24 April 1800 in Lochwinnoch, near Johnstone, Renfrewshire, the eldest of at least nine children of William Shanks, millwright and engineer. His mother was Isabel Anderson. In 1821, after assisting in his father's engineering works for several years, he went to Glasgow University, where he studied chemistry, under Andrew Ure, and medicine to qualify as a doctor. He returned to Johnstone and practised medicine for three years, during which time he also gave scientific lectures at Johnstone's Mechanics' Institute. He then abandoned medicine in favour of the chemical industry. He started a small chemical works in Paisley, manufacturing alum and potassium chromate. This did not prove a success and he subsequently accepted positions in Worcester, and later in Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>In 1836 William Gossage appointed him, together with George Elliott, to assist in the erection and development of Gossage's absorption towers (patented in 1836) at the British Alkali works in Stoke Prior, Worcestershire. In 1841 he moved to St Helens and erected Gossage towers for Gamble and Crosfields. When the Gamble and Crosfields partnership was dissolved in 1845, Shanks became a partner in the new firm, Crosfield Bros. &amp; Co., a position he held for the rest of his life. The firm became Crosfield and Shanks.<br>
<br>Shanks took out the first of several patents for alkali manufacture in the spring of 1841, for improvements in the manufacture of carbonate of soda. In September 1858 he patented a process for preparing chlorine using calcium chromate, for which he was awarded a medal at the 1862 international exhibition. His final patent, taken out in 1863, for improvements in the manufacture of caustic soda and caustic potash, seems never to have gone beyond the experimental stage.<br>
<br>Shanks's name is permanently associated with the system of vats, known as &#145;Shanks's vats&#146;, introduced in 1861 for the extraction of the soda from black ash in the Leblanc method for the production of alkali, but these were never the subject of a patent. Although there is a claim that these vats were introduced by Charles Tennant Dunlop and Heinrich Buff of Giessen, it is generally accepted that Shanks was responsible for their development.<br>
<br>Shanks was president of the Mechanics' Institute of St Helens. He also assisted the St Helens Permanent Building Society. An upright and honest man, he was a Baptist and regularly attended the Myrtle Street Chapel in Liverpool, where the Revd Hugh Stowell Brown was minister. He also worked hard to promote the formation of a Baptist church in St Helens.<br>
<br>Shanks was married twice but had no children. The maiden name of one of his wives (probably the second) was Watt. He died on 13 August 1867 in St Helens. His estate, valued at under &pound;16,000, was distributed between his numerous nephews and nieces.<br>
