<span class="headword">Leather <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smith]</span>,  Ella Mary</span>  (1874&#150;1928), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born on 26 March 1874 at Bidney, in the parish of Dilwyn, Herefordshire, the daughter of James Smith, farmer, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffiths. She was educated at Clyde House School in Hereford and at Hereford High School for Girls. In 1893 she married Francis Leather (1864&#150;1929), a solicitor practising in the small Herefordshire town of Weobley, where she spent the rest of her life. They had three sons: John Francis, who died in France in 1918; Geoffrey, who died in infancy; and Godfrey, who became a solicitor and died in 1943.<br>
<br>In 1905 Leather was persuaded by a friend and local author, the Revd Compton Reade, to contribute a chapter, &#145;The folk-lore of the shire&#146;, to his <span class="italic">Memorials of Old Herefordshire</span> (1905). This was followed by the publication of a selection of Herefordshire folk-tales in the first issue of the <span class="italic">Herefordshire Magazine</span> (1907). She became an ardent folklorist, conscious that the modern world was catching up with Herefordshire and that many of the old country customs of her childhood were dying out.<br>
<br>In 1912 Leather's <span class="italic">The Folk-Lore of Herefordshire</span> was published by Jakeman and Carver in Hereford, with an introduction by the eminent folklorist Edwin Sydney Hartland. The work was fully referenced, not only to the elderly cottagers and residents of hospitals and workhouses who contributed their recollections but also to the many archive and secondary sources consulted by the author. The book has long been considered one of the seminal texts of English folklore and continued to be regularly reprinted from 1912 until at least the 1990s.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Folk-Lore of Herefordshire</span> contained the lyrics and music of twenty-three traditional carols, ballads, and songs. Leather's musical skill was fairly rudimentary, but she was encouraged by Cecil Sharp and the young composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, who recognized the potential of Herefordshire as a source for new folk-music, and arranged for a phonograph to be sent to her. Sharp and Vaughan Williams made several expeditions to Weobley and accompanied Leather on her visits to local Gypsy encampments. Vaughan Williams later regarded a visit to Monkland in September 1912 where they collected a version of &#145;The Unquiet Grave&#146; from the Gypsy tenor Alfred Price Jones as one of his &#145;most memorable musical impressions&#146;  (Jones, 53). In 1920 he collaborated with Leather in the publication of <span class="italic">Twelve Traditional Carols from Herefordshire</span>. Vaughan Williams especially admired &#145;The truth sent from above&#146; and used it in the opening theme of his <span class="italic">Fantasia on Christmas Carols</span> dedicated to Sharp.<br>
<br>In her native county Leather had become a celebrated authority, much sought after as a speaker by visiting antiquarian societies, folklorists, and the Women's Institute, of which she was the Herefordshire president in 1928. She was especially devoted to Weobley and published a paper on its timber-framed houses in the <span class="italic">Transactions [of the] Woolhope Naturalists Club</span> for 1926. She was also personally responsible for preserving the town's old grammar school, a seventeenth-century building which she purchased and used as her study. An undated guide to the parish church was published under her name in which, rather characteristically, the loss of much of the ancient fabric of the church during the restoration of 1868 was regretted. She also planned a &#145;History of Weobley&#146; in 1927, though she did not live to see it completed.<br>
<br>Leather was equally assiduous in the collection of folk-dances. Among other achievements she copied down the dance of the last group of Herefordshire morris men at Bromfield in 1909 and later, in 1925, established the Herefordshire branch of the Folk Dance Society. A dance called &#145;Haste to the wedding&#146; collected by her was performed at the first National Festival of Folk Dance at the Albert Hall in 1926.<br>
<br>Ella Mary Leather died in Weobley of a heart attack on 7 June 1928 and was buried in Weobley churchyard. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Hereford Times</span>  (16 June 1928, 4) regarded her death as a great loss to the nation because her musical finds had enabled Sharp and Vaughan Williams to achieve their fame. She found culture in the reputedly uncultured, and acted as a medium between the musicians of the caravan and those of the hall.<br>
