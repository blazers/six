<span class="headword">Pickwick,  Eleazer</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1749, <em>d.</em> 1837), <span class="occ">stagecoach proprietor</span>, the son of Moses Pickwick (<i>bap</i>. 1725, <i>d</i>. 1799) and his wife, Sarah Smith, was baptized at Freshford parish church, Somerset, on 2 February 1749. His parents were from the village of Limpley Stoke. The family fortunes began and ended in a bizarre manner, for Eleazer was the grandson of a foundling, baptized Moses Pickwick in 1695 in commemoration of his discovery at Pickwick in Corsham, Wiltshire, and his death coincided with the publication of Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span>, which made his name a household word. By then, however, the business was being run by his cousin Moses Pickwick, whose name Dickens's Sam Weller found emblazoned on the London to Bath coach.<br>
<br>At Eleazer's birth the family was living in obscurity on the Wiltshire/Somerset border, but he moved to Bath, where in 1775 he married Susanna Coombs at St Michael's Church, where she had been baptized twenty years earlier. By the end of the decade, building on his experience as a postboy at the Bear inn, he was able to provide the services of a post-coach to London from the Angel inn in Bath whose licence he held. He soon enlarged his scope by increasing the number of services scheduled, especially to London, from Bristol as well as Bath, and by transferring his base to the White Hart, which was a major inn in the centre of Bath. The exemplary manner in which Pickwick undertook the Oxford cross-post to Bath and Bristol was praised by the superintendent of the mails in 1797. The facilities at the White Hart remained vital to Pickwick's business, although by the turn of the century he no longer found it necessary to retain the licence, held since 1782. Pickwick was to be at the profitable heart of the coaching trade in Bath for over half a century.<br>
<br>Municipal recognition came late to Eleazer Pickwick. He was made a freeman of Bath in 1799, and a member of the common council in 1801, becoming mayor in 1826; and although named a turnpike trustee in 1800 he did not qualify for service until 1810. During these years he was also actively engaged in acquiring a landed interest in the area with which his family had earlier been associated. In 1797 he purchased the manor house and lands in the parish of Bathford in Somerset. To this he added Hartley Farm in Batheaston, Somerset, as well as a manor house and lands in the parish of Wingfield in Wiltshire. He owned a freehold property in Bath, in Bath Street, but resided in Westgate Buildings from 1800. About 1830 Pickwick acquired a fine town house in the city, 10 Queen Square, Bath, where he died on 8 December 1837. His wife had predeceased him, dying in 1835; they were both buried at Bathford parish church. Their two sons had died at an early age, and so on Pickwick's death his estate was inherited by his nephew, Captain William Eleazer Pickwick, except for the coaching business. Moses Pickwick had long been associated with this, and had already become the sole proprietor in the mid-1830s. However, the railways dealt coaching a great blow, and in the 1850s Moses retired to a family farm rented since 1800 from Oriel College, Oxford.<br>
<br>A portrait of Eleazer Pickwick, painted about 1803 by John Sanders, shows a bluff ruddy-cheeked man in simple riding habit, at ease in a country setting. His successors, perhaps to erase memories of the foundling, and of Dickens's eccentric characters, and having obtained a grant of arms in 1838, abandoned the name of Pickwick about 1872 in favour of Sainsbury, which was acquired through marriage.<br>
