<span class="headword">Seagrave <span class="st"> [Segrave]</span>,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1258, <em>d.</em> 1316), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25039/', "Nicholas of Seagrave, first Lord Seagrave (1238?&#150;1295)")</script>, and his wife, Maud (Matilda). His date of birth is not recorded, although he seems to have been born in the mid-thirteenth century: he received his first benefice in 1279 and if he was then at least twenty-one, as canon law decreed, he can have been born no later than 1258. He received a university education, since he is called <i>magister</i> by the London chronicler describing his enthronement; it is not known where, but Cambridge must be a possibility, since he was chancellor of that university, probably in 1292&#150;3.<br>
<br>Seagrave's first known benefice was the rectory of Kegworth, Leicestershire, to which he was presented by his father in 1279 when he is described as subdeacon. He was also rector of Aylestone, Leicestershire, from 1293 to 1296. In the early fourteenth century he obtained prebends in the cathedral churches of London, Hereford, and Lincoln, holding the prebend of Portpool at London in 1301, the prebend of Hunderton at Hereford from some time after 1304, and the prebend of St Martin's in Durnstall at Lincoln from 12 August 1302. By 2 June 1306 he was precentor of St Paul's, London, while still retaining his prebends, and the rectory of Fenstanton, Huntingdonshire. A papal letter of 4 June 1306 gives permission for Seagrave to keep the precentorship, which he had obtained without papal dispensation, while retaining the prebends and church mentioned above.<br>
<br>On 16 or 17 August 1313, perhaps with the benefit of the influence of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25038/', "John Seagrave, Lord Seagrave")</script>, Gilbert Seagrave was elected bishop of London. Royal assent was granted on 22 August, the temporalities were restored on 28 September, he was confirmed on 17 September by the chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury, the see of Canterbury being vacant, and was consecrated by Henry Woodlock, bishop of Winchester, on 25 November, on the same day laying the foundation stone for the shrine of St Earconwald. He is reported to have been on bad terms with Archbishop Walter Reynold, but otherwise little is known of his brief episcopate, although he seems to have been conscientious in carrying out his episcopal duties. On 18 April 1314 he began a visitation of his cathedral church and on 26 May of the same year he attended convocation at Blackfriars, London. The extant names of canons of St Paul's during his episcopate do not suggest that he practised nepotism: although two other Seagraves occur, neither was appointed until after the bishop's death. He is known to have kept an episcopal register which would, no doubt, have provided a clearer picture of his activities. However, only a fragment survives, containing an indulgence for those giving towards repairs to the fabric of St Paul's Cathedral and a letter requesting his help in obtaining for Cardinal Raimond de Fargis, a papal appointee, the fruits of his benefice within the diocese.<br>
<br>The new bishop had little time to exercise his diocesan authority. Seagrave died on 18 December 1316, and was buried on the 30th; the site of his grave is unrecorded.<br>
