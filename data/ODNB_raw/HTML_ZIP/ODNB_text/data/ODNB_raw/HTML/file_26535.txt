<span class="headword">Stirling, Sir  Thomas, of Strowan</span>, fifth baronet  (1733&#150;1808), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 8 October 1733, the second son of Sir Henry Stirling of Ardoch, Perthshire, third baronet (1688&#150;1753), and his wife, Anna (<i>d</i>. 1776), the third daughter of Thomas Gordon, admiral of the Russian fleet and governor of Kronstadt. He received a commission from William IV, prince of Orange, stadholder of the United Provinces, on 11 October 1747, and served for ten years in the Scots brigade (afterwards the 94th), then in Dutch service. On 24 March 1757 he was made captain in the 42nd highlanders (the Black Watch), having raised a company for it. He served in the conquest of Canada (1758&#150;9) and the capture of both Martinique (1759) and Havana (1762), when he gained prize money. In 1765 he was sent to take possession of the Illinois territory ceded to Great Britain by the peace of 1763.<br>
<br>The 42nd returned from North America in October 1767 but was sent back in May 1776, after the War of Independence had begun. Stirling had become major on 12 December 1770 and lieutenant-colonel on 7 September 1771, and had raised the strength of the regiment from 350 to 1200 men in five months in 1775. Under his command it took a very active part in the war, and was especially distinguished at the successful storming of Fort Washington, Manhattan Island, New York, on 16 November 1776. Stirling and his men were thanked in general orders. They were again thanked for the capture of a post at Elizabethtown in February 1779. On 19 February Stirling was appointed aide-de-camp to the king and colonel in the army. In the attempt upon Springfield, Massachusetts, in June 1780 he commanded a brigade. His thigh was broken by a shot, but he refused amputation, as it would have disabled him for active service. He was given the colonelcy of the 71st foot on 13 February 1782, but it was reduced soon afterwards. On 20 November he was promoted major-general, and on 13 January 1790 he was made colonel of the 41st foot. He became lieutenant-general on 3 May 1796 and general on 1 January 1801. In 1794 he had bought the estate of Strowan, near Crieff, Perthshire. On the death of his elder brother, Sir William Stirling, fourth baronet, on 26 July 1799, he succeeded as fifth baronet, but did not inherit the Ardoch estate, which passed to his niece and her husband. He died, unmarried, at Strowan on 8 May 1808, when the baronetcy became extinct. He left his property to his sister Ann's son, Thomas Graham (1768&#150;1836) of Airth, Stirlingshire, with reversion to Graham's second son, Thomas James Graham (1811&#150;1896), 42nd highlanders, who took the additional name of Stirling.<br>
