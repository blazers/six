<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Canning, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1823&#150;1908), <span class="occ">civil and electrical engineer</span>, was born at Ogbourne St Andrew, Wiltshire, on 21 July 1823, the son of Robert Canning of Ogbourne St Andrew, and his wife, Frances Hyde. Educated at Salisbury, he gained his first engineering experience (1844&#150;9) with Locke and Errington on the Great Western Railway extensions, and as resident engineer on the Liverpool, Ormskirk, and Preston Railway. From railway work he turned in 1852 to submarine telegraphy, and entering the service of Glass, Elliot &amp; Co., cable manufacturers, he laid in 1855&#150;6 the Canadian cable connecting Cape Breton Island with Newfoundland.<br>
<br>In 1857 Canning assisted Charles Bright with the first Atlantic cable, and he was on board HMS <i>Agamemnon</i> during the submergence of the cable in 1857 and 1858. Subsequently, until 1865, while in the service of Glass, Elliot &amp; Co., he laid cables in the deep waters of the Mediterranean and other seas. He married on 27 September 1859 Elizabeth Ann (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of William Henry Gale of Grately, Hampshire; they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>When the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company was formed in 1865, Canning was appointed its chief engineer, and in that capacity had charge of the manufacture and laying of the Atlantic cables of 1865 and 1866, for which the company were the contractors. This work involved the preparation and fitting-out of the <i>Great Eastern</i>. On 2 August 1865 the cable broke in 2000 fathoms of water. After a second cable had been successfully laid by the <i>Great Eastern</i> (13&#150;27 July 1866), Canning set to work to recover the broken cable, using special grappling machinery, which he devised for the purpose. After several failures, the cable was eventually recovered on 2 September 1866. For these services he was knighted in 1866; the king of Portugal conferred upon him the order of St Jago d'Espada, and the Liverpool chamber of commerce presented him with a gold medal. In 1869 he laid the French Atlantic cable between Brest and Duxbury, Massachusetts.<br>
<br>After his retirement from the service of the Telegraph Construction Company, Canning practised as a consulting engineer in matters connected with telegraphy, and, among other work, superintended the laying of the Marseilles&#150;Algiers and other cables for the India Rubber, Gutta Percha, and Telegraph Works Company, acting later as adviser to the West Indian and Panama and other telegraph companies. When the firm of Callender's decided to adapt their bitumen products to the manufacture of insulated cable, they hired Canning to advise them on the acquisition of machinery for wire work. He was appointed to Callender's board in March 1883, but resigned in December after a dispute over his remuneration. He was a member of both the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He died at Whatley, Twyford, Hampshire, on 24 September 1908, and was buried on 29 September in Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
