<span class="headword">Bainbridge,  John</span>  (1582&#150;1643), <span class="occ">astronomer and physician</span>, was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, the son of Robert Bainbridge and his wife, Anne, daughter of Richard Everard. He was educated first at the grammar school there, and then at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a pensioner in the Lent term, 1600. His tutor is said to have been a distant relative, Joseph Hall. He proceeded BA in 1603&#150;4 and MA in 1607. He received his MD in 1614. He returned to Ashby, where, for a while, he practised medicine, but eventually moved to London, near the church of All Hallows, London Wall, where he was licensed by the College of Physicians on 6 November 1618.<br>
<br>It is evident that Bainbridge had also been studying astronomy and some geometry, for the year after the great comet of 1618 there appeared his first book, <span class="italic">An Astronomicall Description of the Late Comet</span>, dedicated to King James. This was a semi-popular work, Bainbridge leaving the technical details of his observations to his &#145;Latine cosmography&#146;, which was never published and does not survive. There are indications, in the sophistication of his work and correspondence immediately following publication of the former book, that by itself it does not do justice to the level of understanding he had already attained. Bainbridge had become acquainted with Henry Briggs and Henry Savile by late 1618, even before the book was published. Perhaps Briggs, already a noted mathematician, helped to bring Bainbridge to the notice of Savile, who had him appointed the first Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford (and Briggs the first Savilian professor of geometry), in 1620; the two men went up to Merton College that year, and remained there until their deaths. Bainbridge became well established as a teacher and practitioner in his old profession as well, for, having been incorporated MD at Oxford in 1620, he was appointed junior, and then senior, reader of Linacre's lecture, in 1631 and 1635, and medical prescriptions survive among his later papers. It seems that he remained in Merton Street in Oxford for the remainder of his life, moving, on his marriage, from the college to lodgings across the street. His remaining publications, though small and few, reveal an acute intellect and deep learning.<br>
<br>His surviving work, in print and manuscript, provides evidence of Bainbridge's opinions on various matters: he clearly accepted the modern view that comets were supra-lunar, and condemned &#145;Those Philosophers, who still walke in the way of the Gentiles, are afraide to induce generation, or any other mutation into the heavens, rather choosing to follow their blinde guide [Aristotle]&#146;  (Bainbridge, 24); he was not a proponent of Ptolemy's geocentric universe; and he maintained an ambivalent view of astrology, for the early book contains certain &#145;Morall prognosticks of applications of the late comet or blazing-starre&#146;. Yet he later also wrote &#145;Antiprognosticks, in which is briefly detected the vanity of Astrological predictions&#146;, which remained in manuscript.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Bainbridge prepared lectures in astronomy, as required by the Savilian statutes, and the surviving notes record his expressions of the latest developments in astronomy, including the theoretical work of Johannes Kepler. He prepared the <i>editio princeps</i> of (most of) Ptolemy's <span class="italic">Planetary Hypotheses</span>, published in 1620 in a volume that also contained Proclus's <span class="italic">Sphaira</span>. The textual reconstructions of the former have been highly praised by modern scholars. In the mid-1620s he took up the study of Arabic, with a view to the recovery, from medieval Arabic sources, of ancient astronomical observations. He made close and perceptive study of the contents of several Arabic astronomical books. This was not an isolated effort; he sought assistance from others, especially scholars in the Low Countries.<br>
<br>Applying his astronomical knowledge to chronology, a major field of scholarly endeavour in the period, Bainbridge made manifest numerous errors in Joseph Scaliger's explanation of the origins of the Julian calendar in the ancient Egyptian observations of the rising of Sirius, the dog star. His work on this subject was posthumously published, as <span class="italic">Canicularia</span> (1648), by his old student, colleague, and friend John Greaves, who succeeded him as Savilian professor of astronomy. The matrix of scholars that included Bainbridge, Briggs, and Savile also included Sir Christopher Heydon and James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, with whom Bainbridge formed a close friendship and to whom, upon his death, he left his papers.<br>
<br>Bainbridge and his wife, Mary, had a son and a daughter who survived to maturity. He died at his home on 3 November 1643 and was buried in Merton College chapel. The college erected a large monument to him, with a long inscription composed by Greaves, who there memorialized Bainbridge's refutation of Scaliger. Mary Bainbridge had died, intestate, by 1646, in which year Greaves was deeply entangled in legal wrangling over the estate.<br>
<br>Bainbridge's character can be known only from his writings and the kind of life that he led. His legacy to a succeeding generation of astronomers lay in his skilful reconstruction of important astronomical texts from antiquity and his inspiring others, in particular Greaves, to extend his own efforts of recovery of astronomical texts from Arabic sources. An anecdote in Walter Pope's life of Seth Ward pokes fun at Bainbridge's command of Latin, but this, if true, evidently alludes to a mere slip of the pen in a lecture notice concerning Proclus's <span class="italic">Sphaira</span>.<br>
