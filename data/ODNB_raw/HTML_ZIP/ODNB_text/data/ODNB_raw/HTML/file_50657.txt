<span class="headword">Nicholson,  Edward Chambers</span>  (1827&#150;1890), <span class="occ">chemist and dye manufacturer</span>, was born in January 1827 at Lincoln, the seventh son of Robert Nicholson. His mother died the following year and he was brought up by an aunt and, when he was ten, sent away to school in Uxbridge. He started work assisting a chemist and druggist at Andover and then went to work in a London laboratory before entering as one of the first students at the Royal College of Chemistry in 1845. Here he came under the influence of Dr A. W. Hofmann (1818&#150;1888), who was particularly interested in the coal tar derivatives. Through teaching and supervising research, Hofmann inspired many eminent research chemists, including William Perkin.<br>
<br>Nicholson, after working for a couple of years as Hofmann's research assistant, left to investigate the chemistry of iron making with a south Wales company. He was obliged to abandon this work because of an attack of typhoid fever, and returned to London. In 1853 he joined in partnership with two fellow students at the Royal College of Chemistry, as Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson, to manufacture fine chemicals. Nicholson took the lead in meticulous chemical research which he had the ability to transform into viable manufacturing processes. For example, he was credited with the first use of iron stills with mechanical stirring gear. In Hofmann's words: &#145;in him was united the genius of the manufacturer and the habits of a scientific investigator&#146;  (Fox, 104).<br>
<br>Nicholson became very interested in the discovery in 1857 of a mauve coal tar dye by another of Hofmann's students, William Perkin. The partners were refused a licence to use Perkin's process but supplied the latter with raw materials, and soon discovered their own magenta dye process; by 1865 they were the largest producers of coal tar colours in Great Britain. The original premises in Walworth, south London, became too small for their business and in 1865 they moved to the newly built Atlas Dye Works at Hackney Wick, London.<br>
<br>Nicholson's process for making magenta dye, though subject to a provisional patent, was copied and the firm sought injunctions against other makers, including Read Holliday. After long and costly proceedings, the House of Lords ruled in 1866 that, because of careless drafting, the patents on which the firm relied were invalid; they had no legal protection against imitators. Competition brought a collapse in dye prices, from &pound;12 per gallon in 1860 to 12<i>s</i>. in 1866, a 95 per cent fall. As the firm was innovative and efficient, this was not calamitous; within a few years of developing magenta aniline dyes it was offering sulphonated, alkylated, and azo dyes in a wide range of colours and for various uses.<br>
<br>In 1868, when he was only forty-one, Edward Nicholson decided to retire from the business to which he had made such an enormous contribution. There are various possible reasons: his partner George Simpson had retired a couple of years earlier; Hofmann, his mentor and friend, had returned to Germany as professor at the University of Berlin and his inspiration was no doubt sorely missed; and Nicholson had already made a substantial fortune (his will was proved at &pound;147,710). Possibly he wished to withdraw from the pressures of competitive business and, a gentle research chemist, devote himself to his interest in rosaniline dyes. The retirement of the leading British researchers coincided with a great strengthening of the German chemical industry, many of whose chemists had worked in British factories and laboratories. Despite the onset of German competition from about 1870, the firm re-formed as Brooke, Simpson, and Spiller and continued to prosper until the mid-1880s.<br>
<br>Nicholson was an original member of the Society of the Chemical Industry and a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry. Little is known of his private life. His wife, Louisa, survived him and a son, John, joined him in the business in 1866. He died on 23 October 1890 from cancer at his home, Carlton House, Herne Hill, London.<br>
