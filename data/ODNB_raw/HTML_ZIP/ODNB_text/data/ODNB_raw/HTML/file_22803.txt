<span class="headword">Pringle,  Andrew</span>, Lord Alemoor  (<em>d.</em> 1776), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of John Pringle, Lord Haining, a lord of session, and his wife, Anne, eldest daughter of Sir John Murray of Philiphaugh. He was admitted advocate at the Scottish bar in 1740, appointed sheriff of Wigtown in 1750, and in the following year named sheriff of Selkirk. Pringle first came to notice as counsel for the crown in the claims on the forfeited estates, earning a good name and much money. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, his language was plain and straightforward, his gestures restrained, his success at the bar being entirely due to his legal ability. The historian Thomas Somerville described him as &#145;the most admired speaker at the bar in the middle of the last century&#146;  (Somerville, 108).<br>
<br>On 5 July 1755 Pringle was named solicitor-general, and on 14 June 1759 he was raised to the bench as Lord Alemoor, taking his title from a property he owned in Selkirkshire. At the same time he was appointed a lord of justiciary, retiring in 1769. Pringle was a lay elder of the general assembly of the kirk in 1757 when that assembly, opposed to the theatre, expressed outrage at the staging in Edinburgh of <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, a play written by John Home, himself a minister. His speech on behalf of Alexander Carlyle, who had been criticized by the synod for attending the performance, led Carlyle to judge him &#145;the most eloquent of all the Scottish bar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 321).<br>
<br>Alemoor built himself a beautiful villa at Hawkhill, near Edinburgh, where he erected the first grape-house in Scotland. He died at Hawkhill on 14 January 1776. As he was unmarried his estates passed to his brother John Pringle of Haining.<br>
