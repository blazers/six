<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wauchope,  Andrew Gilbert</span>  (1846&#150;1899), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Niddrie Marischal, Midlothian, on 5 July 1846, was the second son of Andrew Wauchope (1818&#150;1874) of Niddrie and his wife, Frances Maria (<i>d</i>. 26 June 1858), daughter of Henry Lloyd of Lloydsburg, co. Tipperary. Sir John Wauchope, the covenanter, was his ancestor. At the age of eleven he was sent to Dr Ellenberger's Pestalozzian school at Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and in June 1858 to Foster's school, Stubbington House, Gosport, to prepare for the navy; there he formed a lasting friendship with Lord Charles Beresford. In 1859 he entered the <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet, and on 5 October 1860 was entered as midshipman on the <i>St George</i>, where he formed a friendship with Prince Alfred. The <i>St George</i> was not a happy ship, and Wauchope was disgusted by the conduct of some of the officers. He decided to change to the army and obtained his discharge on 3 July 1862, then studied with tutors.<br>
<br>Wauchope obtained a commission, by purchase, in the 42nd regiment (the Black Watch) on 21 November 1865, was promoted lieutenant on 23 June 1867, and served as adjutant from 1870 to 1873 at Aldershot and Devonport. He served in the Second Anglo-Asante War from 30 November 1873, obtaining special employment with Russell's regiment of Hausa during its advance from the River Pra to Kumasi. He took part in several engagements, was twice wounded, the second time severely, and was mentioned in the dispatches.<br>
<br>In July 1878, on the annexation of Cyprus, Wauchope was appointed commissioner of the Papho district, where he improved local government and suppressed crime. On his return to England in August 1880 he was made CMG. On 14 September 1878 he was promoted captain. In 1881 he served in the Anglo-Transvaal War, in a staff appointment on the line of communication. In 1882 he served with his regiment in the Egyptian campaign, and was one of the first to enter the trenches at Tell al-Kebir. On 14 March 1884 he was promoted major, and in the eastern Sudan that year served under Sir Gerald Graham as deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general. At the battle of al-Teb he was again severely wounded. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was rewarded on 21 May with a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy. In 1884&#150;5 he served on the Nile expedition, in the river column under Major-General William Earle. At Kirbekan on 11 February 1885 he was again severely wounded.<br>
<br>After the return of the expedition Wauchope went back to Scotland to recover, and for a time devoted himself to his estates. On the death of his elder brother, Major John Wauchope, on 28 November 1882, he had become laird of the family estates of Niddrie Marischal, Midlothian, and Yetholm, Roxburghshire. Scottish agriculture was depressed, and his wealth came from his Niddrie collieries. He was reportedly one of the richest men in Scotland. On 9 December 1882 Wauchope married at Cambo, Elythea Ruth, daughter of Sir Thomas Erskine, baronet, of Cambo: she &#145;united great personal beauty with an equal charm of character&#146;  (Douglas, 173). Following childbirth, she died on 3 February 1884. They had twin sons. One died in 1887, and the other was mentally handicapped.<br>
<br>A staunch tory, Wauchope was Unionist candidate for Midlothian, opposing Gladstone in the 1892 general election and reducing Gladstone's majority from 4631 to 690, despite his refusal to support the <span class="roman">Eight Hours Bill</span> for miners, of whom there were many in the constituency. Gladstone, however, attributed the result not to Wauchope but to &#145;the &#147;Church&#148;&#146;.<br>
<br>Wauchope was a brave, keen professional soldier, devoted to his regiment, and was considerate and paternalist. He paid the fares of his soldiers' wives not on the &#145;strength&#146;, and used to raise his hat to his soldiers' wives &#145;as if they had been ladies&#146;  (Douglas, 166). A Wolseleyite, and effectively one of the younger members of the &#145;ring&#146;, he wrote that Wolseley was &#145;the biggest man in our service&#146;  (ibid., 301). On 21 May 1888 he became colonel, and CB in 1889, and in 1894 he was appointed to command the 2nd battalion, the Black Watch. In October 1893 he married Jean, a daughter of Sir William Muir. They had no children and she survived him.<br>
<br>Wauchope combined his military duties with civilian activities. He was a benevolent and popular landlord and employer. He denounced the 1894 coal strike but helped the strikers' families. He was a master of foxhounds, a member of the local school board and parish council, an elder of his parish church, and a member of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. He enjoyed reading Scott and Marryat and disliked Kipling's portrayal of soldiers. He was tall, lean, blue-eyed, red-haired, and clean-shaven, with a &#145;strangely ascetic face&#146;  (Doyle, 154).<br>
<br>In 1898 Wauchope commanded a brigade in Kitchener's reconquest of the Sudan. He took part in the battles of the Atbara and Omdurman, and on 16 November 1898 was promoted major-general for his services. In April 1899 he received an honorary LLD from Edinburgh, and in June he unsuccessfully contested the South Edinburgh by-election against Arthur Dewar.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899 Wauchope was appointed to command the 3rd (or Highland) brigade. It formed part of the force under General Lord Methuen for the relief of Kimberley, and Wauchope took part in the engagements of Belmont and Modder River. Methuen ordered the Highland brigade to attack the Boer position at Magersfontein by a night march and dawn attack. He failed to secure adequate reconnaissance or use his observation balloon, so the attackers did not know where the Boer defences were. In the early morning of 11 December Wauchope delayed deployment from quarter-column, and they met intense rifle fire from the concealed Boer trenches. Leading them, Wauchope was shot in the groin and temple and killed. Reportedly, his dying words were, &#145;Don't blame me for this, lads&#146;  (Douglas, 412). He was buried on 13 December 1899 at the township of Modder River, and on 18 December was reinterred at Matjesfontein.<br>
