<span class="headword">Pritchard, Sir  Charles Bradley</span>  (1837&#150;1903), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, born at Clapham on 5 May 1837, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22819/', "Charles Pritchard (1808&#150;1893)")</script>, headmaster and astronomer, and his first wife, Emily, daughter of J. Newton. After early education by his father he entered Rugby School in 1849, and was transferred to Sherborne School in 1852. He obtained a nomination to the Indian army, and went to Addiscombe College in 1854, but secured a writership in the Indian Civil Service and completed his education at Haileybury College. In 1862 he married Emily Dorothea, daughter of Hamerton John Williams; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>On his arrival at Bombay in January 1858 Pritchard first served as assistant magistrate and collector at Belgaum, and was active in suppressing banditry in the district. In 1865 he was put in charge of Thana, and carried on a successful campaign to extend the control of the forest department over the forests of the district. Nominated to the province of Khandesh in 1867, he was active in trying to check the exploitation of the Bhils by moneylenders, and in organizing relief measures during the famine of 1868. The trenchant manner in which he dealt with fraud in the public departments led to his appointment as first collector of salt revenue in the Bombay presidency. In this capacity he reformed the administration, suppressed smuggling, and established a large salt factory at Kharaghoda. Considerable opposition was excited by the system of private licences, which he introduced with a view to ensuring that the salt was properly weighed, but owing to his perseverance the controversial tax on salt became gradually easier to collect. The stability of the Bombay salt revenue was henceforth assured, and when in 1876 a commission was appointed to reform the abuses of the Madras salt revenue, Pritchard was nominated its president.<br>
<br>In 1875 Pritchard put forward a plan to reform the system of excise (<i>abkari</i>) on Indian-made liquor and toddy (the fermented sap of palm trees) in the Bombay presidency. At the time the manufacture and sale of these drinks was highly localized, which made it hard for the government to collect the excise. Pritchard's plan was to centralize the manufacture of liquor in central distilleries, to discourage toddy-drinking by placing a steep tax on toddy trees, and to require all liquor shopkeepers to be licensed and to buy their supplies from the central distilleries. These proposals were accepted by the government of Bombay and formed the basis for <span class="roman">Act V</span> of 1878. Pritchard was appointed first <i>abkari</i> commissioner in the same year so that he could personally supervise the implementation of the act. Raising as it did the price of liquor and toddy, the new system proved very unpopular, and there was widespread protest as well as evasion of the law. Although a few concessions had to be made, Pritchard refused to compromise on the fundamental principles. Between 1874 and 1888, excise revenue rose in consequence by 145 per cent.<br>
<br>Pritchard, who had been made CSI in 1886, held the post of commissioner of Sind from 1887 to 1889, and there he did much to develop harbour works and railway communications. He revived the idea of the Jamrao canal, which was completed in 1901, and he set on foot the scheme for the construction of a line linking up Karachi with the railway system of Rajputana which was carried out by his successor, Sir Arthur Trevor.<br>
<br>In November 1890 Pritchard was promoted to be revenue member of the government of Bombay, and in 1891 was created KCIE. In the following year he took his seat on the central legislative council as member for the public works department. During his tenure of office he frequently found himself at variance with Lord Elgin, the viceroy, and with the majority of his colleagues on questions of high policy. He disapproved of the &#145;forward&#146; policy, and he joined Sir Antony MacDonnell and Sir James Westland in protesting against the high expenditure and casualties involved in military expeditions to Waziristan, Swat, Chitral, and Tirah. In 1896 his health showed signs of failure, and he resigned his seat on the council. He returned to England and settled in London. He died at his home, 2 Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 23 November 1903, and was buried at Norwood. A memorial tablet to him was placed in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London.<br>
