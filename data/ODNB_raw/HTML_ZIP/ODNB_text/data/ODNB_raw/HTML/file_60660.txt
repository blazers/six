<span class="headword">Corsellis,  Timothy John Manley</span>  (1921&#150;1941), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 27 January 1921 at Hazelwood, North Park, Eltham, London, the son of Douglas Henry Corsellis, analytical chemist and barrister, and Helen Mary Corsellis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bendall. His father had served as a captain in the machine-gun corps during the First World War. Corsellis entered Winchester College in 1934 and some of his early poems appeared in <span class="italic">The Wykhamist Literary Supplement</span>. It was at Winchester that he formed the most influential friendship of his brief life, that with the poet Nigel Weir. A few months his senior, Weir was a linguist and naturalist whose open-faced idealism drew a questioning response from the younger boy. They fenced in the school gym, discussed their work, and gradually took up contrasting positions over the looming disaster of war which would destroy them both. Weir joined the celebrated Oxford University air squadron which his father had founded, and was awarded a half-blue for fencing; Corsellis became a member of ARP (air-raid precautions) and toiled in the East End of London. His &#145;Dawn after a Raid&#146; vividly describes the confusion of homeliness and horror that was the blitz. A series of fine nature poems at this time included &#145;The Thrush&#146;, in which he confesses to Weir, &#145;I stopped his song&#146;. On 8 August 1940 Weir shot down three German planes during the battle of Britain and won the DFC. He was killed flying in November, and his death left Corsellis isolated. &#145;In memoriam N.W.&#146; thrusts aside the conventions of their uneasy relationship: it is an anti-war hero poem which sees Weir<blockquote>
<div>Moving among the Spitfires &hellip; And I pitied the German sons<br>
</div>
<div>And I pitied his troubled soul.<br>
</div> (Corsellis, &#145;In memoriam N.W.&#146;, <span class="italic">Poems</span>)</blockquote>Corsellis's poetry reflects the nadir of the Second World War when the thoughts of so many people, especially the young, ran contrary to the official rhetoric. Reels of grinning soldiers in the news-cinema made him ask, &#145;Where are you going to, laughing men? For a holiday on the sea?&#146; And when he himself joined the RAF he was crushed by the sordidness and inertia of the barracks; his poem &#145;Drill&#146; perfectly encapsulating this common experience. He had little or no contact with other writers but a meeting with Stephen Spender resulted in an astute and moving appraisal of an established figure.<blockquote>
<div>I had expected an overwhelming greatness.<br>
</div>
<div>Now I see you much as I am.<br>
</div>
<div>You sit with a disturbance in your mind.<br>
</div> (Corsellis, &#145;Stephen Spender&#146;, <span class="italic">Poems</span>)</blockquote>Corsellis was a war poet who closely examined the ennui, boredom, and casual cruelty of his day. There are none of the literary references in his work which one might expect from such a young writer. In September 1939 Nigel Weir could write:<blockquote>
<div>There is a death, Elizabeth,<br>
</div>
<div>for which we all must wait;<br>
</div>
<div>and men and war can do no more<br>
</div>
<div>than try to change the date.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Corsellis's fatalism was of a different kind. In no more than a handful of remarkable poems he was able to express certain attitudes towards the conflict which were common, though incoherent, during its darkest months. He is an uncomfortable realist who until he is able to make &#145;cartwheels in the sky&#146; is plunged into all kinds of meanness. &#145;The sacrifice is greater than I ever expected.&#146;<br>
<br>After training as a leading aircraftsman, Corsellis became a second officer in the Air Transport Auxiliary. This was a civilian organization connected to the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The twenty-year-old Corsellis was piloting a Magister aircraft L8268 on a ferrying flight from Luton to Carlisle on 10 October 1941 when it stalled in a turn and hit a tree near Annan, Dumfriesshire, and he was killed.<br>
<br>As with so many servicemen poets of the period, Timothy Corsellis first had his work published by the admirable Keidrich Rhys, himself serving as a gunner in the Royal Artillery. It belongs to the group of air force poets who include Henry Treece, John Pudney, and Vernon Watkins, while remaining distinctive and troubling. An edition of his collected poems has never been published. Corsellis's originality lies in his ability to reveal youthful disappointment with what was offered him. Barely grown up, and lacking his friend Weir's strong sense of cause, he wrote poetry that is a severe indictment of the grim world into which the war cast him.<blockquote>
<div>Sometimes we pray to be hardened and callous,<br>
</div>
<div>But God turns a deaf ear,<br>
</div>
<div>And we know hate and sorrow&#151;intimately,<br>
</div>
<div>And we do not mind dying tomorrow.<br>
</div> (Corsellis, &#145;Dawn after the Raid&#146;, <span class="italic">Poems</span>)</blockquote>
