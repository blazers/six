</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Etty,  William</span>  (1787&#150;1849), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 20 Feasegate, York, on 10 March 1787, the seventh child of Matthew Etty (1743&#150;1818) and Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Calverley (1754&#150;1829). His father was a baker and miller; Esther Etty was of gentle birth and a forceful character. Etty recalls in his &#145;Autobiography&#146; (published in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, January 1849), that the &#145;first panels on which I drew were the boards of my father's shop floor&#146;  (Etty, 13), and he graduated from white chalk to watercolour and crudely made oil paints. Alexander Gilchrist, Etty's first biographer, records that his uncle William showed artistic talent, but an austere Wesleyan Methodist upbringing was not very conducive to Etty's development as an artist  (Gilchrist, 1.21&#150;2).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>After a rudimentary schooling Etty had to serve a seven-year apprenticeship to a printer at Hull from October 1798 to 1805. He worked for three weeks as a journeyman printer, before his prosperous uncle William (1740&#150;1809), a manufacturer of gold lace, invited him to his house at 3 Lombard Street, London, in November 1805. Etty's elder brother Walter (1774&#150;1850), who supported him financially for many years, became a partner in the gold lace firm of Bodley, Etty, and Bodley in 1809. Etty had to overcome the twin disadvantages of a deficient education and a late start in his profession; he spent a year drawing from prints and from nature, besides copying from antique casts in J. B. Gianelli's cast shop, near Smithfield, in preparation for the Royal Academy Schools, where he was enrolled in January 1807. His generous uncle paid 100 guineas' premium in July 1807 to enable Etty to study for a year with Sir Thomas Lawrence. He learned to imitate something of Lawrence's style and later earned money by making copies for him.<h2>
<a name="Studentyears"></a>Student years</h2>More immediately important to Etty were John Opie's lectures on painting to the Royal Academy students (published in 1809), that fired Etty's ambition to become a history painter. Opie extolled the work of Titian and Rubens, two artists whose techniques greatly differed, but by whom Etty was inspired to paint the female nude in succulent textures and full-blooded colour, an innovation that later established his reputation and, less agreeably, invited censure from contemporary critics. Henry Fuseli, keeper of the Royal Academy Schools, widened Etty's intellectual horizons; and John Flaxman, appointed professor of sculpture in 1810, both by his lectures and by the example of his line engravings of antique subjects provided him with an iconographic vocabulary. Etty's lifelong devotion to the Royal Academy life school provoked comment from his fellow Academicians. On his uncle William's death in May 1809, Etty received a handsome legacy and moved into a succession of lodgings, until, in 1824, he settled at 14 Buckingham Street, Strand, London. He lived there until his retirement in June 1848 when he moved to a house in Coney Street, York, which he had bought for &pound;1100 two years before.<br>
<br>Etty advanced slowly in comparison with successful near-contemporaries such as David Wilkie, and between 1808 and 1811 strove to improve his anatomical knowledge by studying anatomical atlases and prints of antique sculpture. In 1811 he sold, for 25 guineas, a <span class="italic">Sappho</span>, from the British Institution exhibition, and showed <span class="italic">Telemachus Rescues Antiope from the Fury of the Wild Boar</span> at the Royal Academy. Thereafter, he became a regular contributor to the academy summer exhibitions. Some family portraits of 1811 apart, none of his early exhibited works has survived, but seven sketchbooks covering the period 1810&#150;35 in York City Art Gallery provide evidence of his powers of draughtsmanship, of his artistic development, and of which old masters interested him on his travels. <span class="italic">Manlius Hurled from the Rock</span> (1818; Birmingham Art Gallery), exhibited at the British Institution in 1819, is the first of his surviving early heroic works. A somewhat drily painted academy male nude is seen back view, plunging through space to its doom; influenced by antique sculpture and Michelangelo, it shows Etty's ambitious approach to history painting. Far more appealing are two highly competent large half-length portraits, <span class="italic">The Rev. Robert Bolton</span> and <span class="italic">Mrs Robert Bolton and her Children</span>, painted in 1818 (New York Historical Society, New York). Although grandly conceived, with classically inspired poses, they have an unforced naturalism that Etty would have learned from Lawrence, while avoiding his master's glittering finish. The portrait <span class="italic">Miss Arabella Mary Jay</span> (1818; National Gallery, London) is more obviously in the Lawrence style.<h2>
<a name="FirstvisitstoFranceandItaly"></a>First visits to France and Italy</h2>Etty travelled to France in early January 1815, arriving at Calais, from where he wrote to his brother Walter; this letter is the only evidence of the visit. Whether he reached Paris or not is unknown; in September 1816 he embarked for Italy, travelling to Paris and Dijon <i>en route</i> for Switzerland and Florence. Alone, ill, unrequited in love, and homesick as he was, his first Italian expedition was a failure, and he returned to Paris in late October, staying a month. He entered the neo-classicist painter Jean-Baptiste Regnault's studio briefly, besides studying at the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts. Etty began collecting prints assiduously; these were later to be an iconographic treasure trove.<h2>
<a name="Earlysuccesses"></a>Early successes</h2>Two paintings sent to the Royal Academy exhibition of 1820 won Etty some critical attention: <span class="italic">The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos</span> and <span class="italic">Drunken Barnaby</span> (both priv. colls.); the latter was an uncharacteristic essay in the domestic genre popularized by William Mulready and Wilkie. <span class="italic">The Coral Finder</span> is the first of those serene mythological compositions that Etty made so peculiarly his own, and which surprised both the public and his fellow artists by their freshness and apparent originality. He sold it for &pound;30 to a pianoforte maker, and won a commission from Sir Francis Freeling, secretary to the Post Office. This was for <span class="italic">Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia</span> (exh. RA, 1821; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), a subject taken from Plutarch's <span class="italic">Life of Antony</span> and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>. The palette is still somewhat gaudy and the scale of the boat to its occupants absurdly idiosyncratic; although both the <span class="italic">Coral Finder</span> and the <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> are indebted to Titian, Etty was principally inspired by the crowded allegorical compositions of Regnault and the eclecticism practised by contemporary academic painters. There are echoes of Rubens's <span class="italic">The Landing of Marie de M&eacute;dicis</span> (Louvre, Paris), in the figures of the Triton and sea-nymphs, which Etty had admired in 1816. The <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span>, praised by reviewers, also provoked the first of those charges of indecency that were to persist until the late 1830s. The <span class="italic">Times</span> critic wrote:<blockquote>we take this opportunity of advising Mr Etty, who got some reputation for painting <span class="italic">Cleopatra's Galley</span>, not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only the most vicious taste. Naked figures, when painted with the purity of Raphael, may be endured: but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent, and in Mr Etty's canvass is mere dirty flesh. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Jan 1822)</blockquote>The &#145;canvass&#146; referred to was a preliminary study for <span class="italic">Youth on the Prow and Pleasure at the Helm</span> (1832; Tate collection), exhibited at the British Institution. Clearly, Etty had struck a new note, but the literal directness with which he painted the female nude, a quality admired by Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, annoyed his critics. He made no attempt to idealize or &#145;etherealize&#146; the female form, and fell foul of the emerging cult of respectability, led by the sabbatarian evangelicals of the Clapham Sect.<h2>
<a name="Ettysgrandtour"></a>Etty's grand tour</h2>Accompanied by a fellow student, Richard Evans, Etty set off in June 1822 on his grand tour, only returning to England in early January 1824. He benefited greatly from his experiences, studying intensively and travelling as far as Naples, where he spent a month, with prolonged stays in Rome and, above all, in Venice, which became a second home and where he remained for almost nine months: &#145;dear Venice&#151;Venezia, cara Venezia! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now! Venice, the birthplace and cradle of colour, the hope and glory of my professional life&#146;  (Etty, 38). He was welcomed by the British vice-consul and by the artists of the Accademia, who nicknamed him Il Diavolo for the speed with which he painted nude studies, and they elected Lawrence and him honorary academicians. Extensive correspondence with his brother Walter and with Lawrence enables us to follow Etty's peregrinations closely and gauge what most interested him. He copied industriously, making many &#145;memorials&#146; of paintings by Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, as well as a full-size copy of Titian's <span class="italic">Venus of Urbino</span> (Royal Academy of Scotland, Edinburgh) in the Uffizi, Florence, and of Titian's <span class="italic">Sacred and Profane Love</span> in the Borghese, Rome. Back in Paris by November 1823, he stayed on into the new year to paint copies in the Louvre after Rubens's &#145;water nymphs&#146; (from the <span class="italic">Landing of Marie de M&eacute;dicis</span>), Veronese's <span class="italic">Marriage of Cana</span>, and Poussin's <span class="italic">Le d&eacute;luge: l'hiver</span>. These were artists whom Delacroix admired at about the same time, and for a brief moment Etty and Delacroix pursued similar interests; Delacroix met Etty in London in 1825, but there is no evidence of any close professional friendship.<h2>
<a name="Academichonours"></a>Academic honours</h2>Etty's foreign tour had greatly increased his self-confidence and skill; he simplified his compositions, and <span class="italic">Pandora Crowned by the Seasons</span> (City Art Gallery, Leeds), shown at the 1824 Royal Academy exhibition, reflects this greater maturity. The flattened diamond-shaped grouping of the main figures around Pandora became, with variations, a favourite formula throughout the rest of his career. The paint handling is now far more subtle, the palette more harmonious, and the general tonality cooler. Lawrence bought the painting for 300 guineas, a welcome accolade. Still more welcome was his election as an associate of the Royal Academy on 1 November 1824. In 1818 Etty had hired an assistant, George Henry Franklin, who served him for thirty years until they became estranged. Some of the poorer imitations of Etty's life studies may be Franklin's work. Notwithstanding his uncle's legacy, Etty was still heavily dependent on his brother Walter's financial help; his move to larger quarters in Buckingham Street in June 1824 caused him considerable anxiety. A niece, Elizabeth, kept house for him from about 1819 to his death. As late as May 1831, Etty owed Walter &pound;804, Walter having paid out &pound;3937 on Etty's behalf and received &pound;3133  (Gilchrist, 1.358&#150;9); by 1841, however, all outstanding debts had been paid, and Etty had &pound;300 invested in 3 per cent bank stock. By the end of November 1845 he had &pound;8500 so invested, but at his death this had doubled to &pound;17,000 in funds. This dramatic turnaround was largely due to the emerging class of self-made men such as the Birmingham pen-nib manufacturer Joseph Gillott, and Daniel Grant, a Manchester cotton magnate, who patronized Etty, and to the dealers who promoted his work.<br>
<br>The years 1825&#150;40 undoubtedly form Etty's &#145;heroic&#146; period, to which belong most of the <i>grandes machines</i>, beginning with <span class="italic">The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished&#151;an Ideal Group</span> (NG Scot.), shown at the Royal Academy in 1825. This illustrates an abstract virtue, Mercy, and is shorn of any underlying historical or mythological story. Although the figures recall combat scenes in the metopes of the Elgin marbles, there is a pervasive tempestuous romanticism. More classically inspired was the large <span class="italic">Judgment of Paris</span> (Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), commissioned by Lord Darnley for &pound;500, and shown at the Royal Academy in 1826. Etty reinvigorated a hackneyed subject, and <span class="italic">The Times</span> praised him for his &#145;brilliant and harmonious colouring, combined with graceful grouping and careful execution, such as no artist of the present day can equal&#146;  (29 April 1826). The general composition derives from a Flaxman engraving of the subject, from Rubens, and, ultimately, from a Marcantonio Raimondi engraving after a lost <span class="italic">Judgment</span> by Raphael. The <span class="italic">Judith and Holofernes</span>, shown at the Royal Academy in 1827, was the first of a trilogy, based on the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> story, illustrating the theme of patriotism. The Royal Scottish Academy, having bought the <span class="italic">Judith</span>, in 1829 commissioned Etty to paint two pendants, which were exhibited in 1830 and 1831; all three pictures are now in the National Gallery of Scotland. Some of the oil sketches for the central panel have a vigour and brilliance quite unlike any other contemporary English artist's work. The fluent brushstrokes, glazing of half-tones, and brilliant colour appear again in his <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> (Manchester City Galleries) of 1825, showing him in classical cameo-like profile, but infused with a brooding introspection that places it with similar works of the French Romantic school.<br>
<br>Etty's portraits, usually of friends and relatives, are among his most attractive creations, being notable for a direct, sympathetic insight into character, especially so for the male sitters; while in his female portraits he captures equally well the charm and freshness of youth or matronly gravitas. He began to paint still lifes as self-sufficient subjects in September 1839; they have the same delightful fluency, and are unusual in English art of the time. Early in his career he had thought of becoming a landscape painter, and the several landscapes he painted in the 1840s have an atmospheric vividness that makes one regret he did not paint more of them.<br>
<br>Etty became a Royal Academician in February 1828, and presented his diploma work, <span class="italic">Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs</span> (Royal Academy), that October. A large work (51 in. &times; 70&frac12; in.), it has a simple monumentality and mingles Venetian colour with a Poussinesque composition. The nymph is displayed in a twisting pose and the two satyrs struggle between themselves to reveal her, thus providing a dynamic tension which Roger Fry found disturbing. Etty, in Paris during the 1830 July revolution, made five copies in the Louvre, including one of Giorgione's <span class="italic">F&ecirc;te champ&ecirc;tre</span> (priv. coll.), and another of Ruisdael's <span class="italic">Fresh Breeze: Sea Coast</span>. Perhaps as a respite from his heroic compositions, he began to paint, in 1831, a new type of subject matter, <span class="italic">Window in Venice during a Festa</span> (Tate collection). This shows a group of three elegantly dressed young women, two of whom lean out over a vine-clad balcony observing the festive crowd hidden from view. It is the secular equivalent of the Venetian <i>sacra conversazione</i>, and was bought by an army contractor, Robert Vernon, for &pound;120. Vernon bequeathed 160 paintings, mostly by contemporary English artists, including eleven Ettys, to the National Gallery, London, in 1847.<h2>
<a name="Prosperityanddecline"></a>Prosperity and decline</h2>Etty's later religious subjects included, among others, the figures of Moses and Aaron for the church of St Edmund, King and Martyr, London, in 1833, and two versions of the Prodigal Son, in 1836 and 1841; they culminated in an ambitious trilogy devoted to the life and martyrdom of Joan of Arc (exh. RA, 1847), on which he spent much time and effort, even travelling in 1843 to Rouen, Paris, and Orl&eacute;ans to gather impressions of places connected with St Joan. The engraver C. W. Wass and the dealer Richard Colls jointly bought all three for 2500 guineas as a speculation. Wass engraved them, but the paintings were split up, and only the left and central panels seem to have survived: the former, <span class="italic">Joan of Arc, on Finding the Sword</span>, in a private collection, and the latter, <span class="italic">Joan of Arc Making her Sortie</span>, in a museum at Orl&eacute;ans. They measure 6 feet 6 inches by 9 feet 9 inches and 15 feet by 9 feet 9 inches respectively, and do not add much lustre to Etty's reputation. By the 1830s Etty had abandoned his Methodist roots, becoming increasingly attached to high Anglicanism, and at times wistfully recalling the glories of the &#145;old faith&#146;. As late as November 1847, he sought Sir Charles Eastlake's advice on the merits of Roman Catholicism, but unlike A. W. N. Pugin, whom he knew and admired, he did not become a convert. He campaigned vigorously in defence of York Minster and the preservation of the British medieval heritage, against the vandalisms of modern &#145;restorers&#146;. He served on the council of the South Kensington School of Design and championed the establishment of such a school at York, which opened in 1842.<br>
<br>By the late 1830s, Etty's work began to show signs of unevenness and his brushwork became looser; physically, the artist increasingly suffered from rheumatism and asthma. He had resigned himself to bachelorhood. Short in stature, his face scarred by smallpox, with sandy hair and a &#145;shrill and feeble tone of voice&#146; (so noted the actor, William Macready, in his diary, in 1822), Etty, although much liked by many friends, was probably too easily rebuffed (and impecunious) to find a wife  (F. Pollock, ed., <span class="italic">Macready's Reminiscences, and Selections from his Diaries and Letters</span>, 1875, 1.xvi, p. 266). Perhaps his devotion to the female nude was a form of sublimation. Yet he could still produce large mythological works, such as <span class="italic">The Sirens and Ulysses</span> (exh. RA, 1837; Manchester City Galleries), almost 10 by 15 feet, and <span class="italic">Pluto Carrying off Proserpine</span> (priv. coll.) shown at the Royal Academy in 1839, that again caused some critics to complain of indecency, charges that he repudiated. He was invited by the prince consort in 1843 to submit a design for one of eight lunettes in a new summer pavilion in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, to illustrate Milton's <span class="italic">Masque of Comus</span>. He could not master the unfamiliar medium of fresco, and eventually painted a version in oils: <span class="italic">Circe</span> (Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth), and a new subject, <span class="italic">Hesperus</span> (Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), shown at the Royal Academy in 1844. In 1840 and 1842, he visited the Low Countries and lower Rhineland to see altarpieces by Rubens.<br>
<br>At a private view on 9 June 1849, Etty had the satisfaction of seeing 133 of his paintings, spanning 1820&#150;48, exhibited in London at the Society of Arts, Adelphi; the exhibition ran for three months, and was warmly praised by fellow artists, but received mixed reviews. Etty had a genuine gift for beautifully fresh brushwork and a spontaneity of expression that was justly admired; but he was wedded to the grand history piece as his chosen vehicle to paint &#145;some great moral on the heart&#146;  (Etty, 40). He was neither the Ingres nor the Delacroix of the British school; his considerable native talent was too often constrained by an outmoded classicism. His reputation was not well served by pressure from dealers to produce small, easily saleable pictures, in his later years. A man of strong feelings and simple piety, he succumbed to an unusually fierce attack of asthma on 3 November; ten days later, speaking serenely of death's mystery&#151;&#145;wonderful, wonderful, this death&#146;&#151;he died at his home in Coney Street, York, in the evening of 13 November 1849. He was buried, with full public honours, in St Olave's churchyard, York, on 23 November. In May 1850, the contents of his studio were sold at Christies over seven days for &pound;5186 16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. Substantial holdings of Etty's paintings are in the Tate collection and York City Art Gallery.<br>
