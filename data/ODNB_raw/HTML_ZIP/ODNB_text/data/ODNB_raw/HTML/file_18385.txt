<span class="headword">Maurice,  Henry</span>  (1647?&#150;1691), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Thomas Maurice, perpetual curate of Llangristiolus, Anglesey, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21995/', "Henry Perry (or Parry)")</script>, the linguistic scholar. After attending Beaumaris grammar school he matriculated on 20 May 1664 from Jesus College, Oxford, aged sixteen; he graduated BA on 28 January 1668 and proceeded MA in 1671; he was created BD in 1679 and DD in 1683. His ability as a student attracted the attention of Sir Leoline Jenkins, then principal of the college, and he was elected to a fellowship. After 1669 he became, at the request of the college, the curate of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where, according to Anthony Wood, he answered some &#145;malapert Socinians&#146; so successfully &#145;that he gained himself a great reputation&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 1813&#150;20, 4.326). In 1671 he returned to the college, but in 1673 he left again to accompany Jenkins as his chaplain to the congress of Cologne, where the latter was an English representative in the attempts to settle a peace between the belligerents in the Third Dutch War. Jenkins returned to England in May 1674 but Maurice again accompanied him as chaplain on his mission at the treaty negotiations at Nijmegen between 1676 and 1679. During his years abroad Maurice developed his skills in modern languages and established lasting contacts with French protestant divines. In England he lived for a while with Jenkins's family at Doctors' Commons, London, and in college until 1680. Jenkins's contacts were essentially in the law, and it needed an ecclesiastical patron in the person of William Lloyd (made bishop of St Asaph in 1680) to get Maurice appointed as domestic chaplain to William Sancroft in that year.<br>
<br>Maurice continued in this post until 1691, and published frequently during the 1680s. He was involved in a controversy with the nonconformists Richard Baxter and David Clarkson over the existence of diocesan episcopacy in the primitive church. Maurice's <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Primitive Church and Diocesan Episcopacy</span> (1682) proved the necessity of episcopacy from primitive practice, defending John Tillotson's historical view of its creation as not being defined by Christ but emerging from the diocesan model used by the apostles. He believed that it was essentially episcopal government that had saved the Church of England from the internecine conflicts that plagued other European reformed churches. According to his biographer, Robert Wynne, the controversy with Baxter and Clarkson considerably raised Maurice's profile among the London clergy. He also attacked the duke of Buckingham's proposals for religious toleration, arguing like many Anglican divines that it was a neglect of their duty to look after the cure of souls to permit the &#145;errors&#146; of dissent, stating that &#145;Penalties in matters of Religion&#146; were designed &#145;to remove such evil obstructions as lie in the Passage to a man's right Reason&#146;  (H. Maurice, <span class="italic">The Antithelemite, or, An Answer to Certain Quaeres by the D. of B.</span>, 1685, 41). Wood alleged that Maurice was the author of <span class="italic">Animadversions on Dr Burnet's &#145;History of the Rights of Princes&#146;</span> (1682), but this seems to have been by Thomas Comber. Maurice was also acknowledged as an eloquent extempore preacher. However, his verbal brilliance seems to have masked an apparent aversion to the act of writing itself, notwithstanding his polemical interventions in the 1680s. He only ever published one sermon (given before the king at Whitehall in 1681 on the anniversary of Charles I's death) and Wynne claims that he had to act as an amanuensis for him to produce his anti-Catholic work <span class="italic">Doubts Concerning the Roman Infallibility</span> (1688).<br>
<br>Under the patronage of Sancroft, Maurice received the treasurership of Chichester on 7 January 1681, the rectory of Chevening, Kent, which he held from 1681 to 1685, and, in 1685, the sinecure rectory of Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire. In the same year he was presented to the richly endowed rectory of Newington, Oxfordshire. Despite his closeness to Sancroft, Maurice did not support his patron's decision to refuse the oaths of allegiance to William and Mary. He wrote in favour of recognizing the new monarchs, arguing that Princess Mary was, in any case, a blood heir, and that having William as joint monarch represented only a &#145;small deviation&#146; from the right line  (Maurice, <span class="italic">The Lawfulness of Taking the New Oaths Asserted</span>, 3). However, like many tory jurors, he used something of a hotch-potch of arguments to press taking the oaths, insisting that as he was the nation's <i>de facto</i> protector William was owed the natural duty of obedience, and hinting at contract theory by suggesting that James's actions might have violated his coronation oath. Maurice is often cited as the author of <span class="italic">A Letter to a Member of the House of Commons Concerning the Bishops</span> (1689), which argued for leniency towards Sancroft and the other nonjuring bishops. In fact, he was the author of a reply to this pamphlet which insisted that the bishops should take the oaths or lose their places. At the very least, he contended, they should make some public declaration of loyalty. George Hickes, who seems to have guessed the pamphlet's authorship, wondered whether Maurice's apparent vindictiveness was born out of a desire to see his metropolitan &#145;cap and cringe&#146; before him  (Hickes, 2). It seems more likely, though, that Maurice's loyalty to the Williamite regime stemmed from his virulent hatred of popery (for which he was attacked in print in 1688 by an anonymous Catholic writer) and that he saw the Church of England as best defended by the new government. None the less, he continued to write in opposition to further alterations to the Anglican liturgy to appease protestant dissenters after the revolution.<br>
<br>Maurice's opposition to such compromises helps to explain his influential position within resolutely anti-comprehensionist Oxford, both diocese and university. He was chosen by the clergy of the diocese of Oxford in October 1689 to be their representative in the convocation held at Westminster. He was elected Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Oxford on 18 July 1691 (Wynne states by only six votes) and was installed in the prebend of Worcester which went with the post. He died suddenly on 30 October 1691 at the age of forty-four (according to the funeral monument to him in Jesus College chapel), probably of a heart attack at his house in Newington, and was buried in the chancel of the church there on 6 November. He was unmarried and his estate was administered by his sister, Elizabeth Clancey, a widow. He donated his library to his college. He was renowned for his generosity and saved little, keeping only a sum of &pound;200 with his college. Wynne testified to his convivial character, saying that there &#145;was no man alive more capable of conveying instruction over a moderate Bottle than Dr Maurice&#146;  (Wynne, 23).<br>
