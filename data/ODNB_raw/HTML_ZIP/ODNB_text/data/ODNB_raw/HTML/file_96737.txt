<span class="headword">Williams <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Whistler]</span>,  Peggy Eileen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Margiad Evans]</span>  (1909&#150;1958), <span class="occ">writer and artist</span>, was born on 17 March 1909 at Rush Holt, Uxbridge, Middlesex, the second daughter of Godfrey James Whistler (1866&#150;1936), an insurance clerk, and his wife, Katherine Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood (<i>b</i>. 1873/4). Peggy Whistler's deep love for the Herefordshire countryside was kindled during her stays at her aunt's farm near Ross-on-Wye, from 1918 onwards. By 1921 the family had settled at nearby Bridstow and Peggy was educated at Ross high school. After a brief period teaching at a French school near Tours she attended classes at Hereford School of Art and later spent a few months painting in Brittany in 1926. After short-term jobs in England as a governess and a housekeeper she was commissioned by Basil Blackwell to provide the striking black-and-white illustrations for Alfred Williams's <span class="italic">Tales from the Panchatantra</span> (1930). However, writing soon became her main medium of expression. Her <i>nom de plume</i>, Margiad Evans, was partly inspired by her stay at Pontllyfni in Caernarvonshire, where she worked on her first novel, <span class="italic">Country Dance</span> (1932), which evokes tensions in a nineteenth-century Welsh border community. The tightly constructed narrative brings to life the voice&#151;silenced by male violence&#151;of the young daughter of a Welsh mother and English father, torn between conflicting identities and suitors. The author relished reviewers' ignorance that the Peggy Whistler who provided the illustrations was also the author Margiad Evans.<br>
<br>After the success of <span class="italic">Country Dance</span> three further novels, <span class="italic">The Wooden Doctor</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Turf or Stone</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Creed</span> (1936), followed rapidly. All are based in Ross and the surrounding district and draw on her own life and circumstances. Although partly influenced by writers such as the Bront&euml; sisters and Mary Webb, the novels are highly original in the treatment of their strong narratives. Again they featured her own visual images, as frontispieces and book-jackets. After her father's death in 1936 the family home was sold and for the next three years she ran the Springherne guest house at Bull's Hill, near Ross, together with her younger sister Nancy and her friend Helen Blackwell, the daughter of her publisher. While at Springherne she met a Welshman, George Michael Mendus Williams, whom she married on 28 October 1940 at Gloucester register office. By January 1941 they were living at Llangarron, five miles from Ross, where her husband worked on a farm. Since a projected fifth novel, &#145;The Widower's Tale&#146;, had proved intractable, between domestic tasks, gardening, and occasional farm work, she turned instead to keeping a journal. This formed the basis of <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1943), a poetic and spiritual exploration of the relationship between the human individual and the natural world. During this period, while her husband was in the armed forces, she also wrote and published poetry and short stories: <span class="italic">Poems from Obscurity</span> appeared in 1947, and <span class="italic">The Old and the Young</span>, an impressive collection of stories reflecting life in rural Herefordshire, in 1948.<br>
<br>The years 1948&#150;9 brought worries about work and housing, but in March 1950 Peggy Williams moved to Elkstone, Gloucestershire, while her husband trained as a teacher at Cheltenham six miles away. At Elkstone she suffered her first epileptic fit, and shortly afterwards, in late July 1950 she discovered that she was pregnant. Her response to this crisis was to write, and her attempts to understand her epilepsy and come to terms with it are analysed in <span class="italic">A Ray of Darkness</span> (1952), a remarkable volume combining factual narrative with poetic and spiritual meditation on her condition.<br>
<br>In 1953 the couple moved with their young daughter, Cassandra, to Hartfield in Sussex, where Michael Williams took up a teaching post. Here Peggy struggled not only with her worsening physical condition but also with a keen sense of exile from her beloved Herefordshire countryside. Her correspondence, from 1949 onwards, with the American writer Winifred Ellerman (<i>pseud</i>. Bryher) reveals how much she valued the latter's moral as well as financial support. Still impelled to write, she recorded her life in journals and letters and produced a stream of literary works in verse and prose. However, publishing her work had become more difficult, perhaps as much because of changes in fashion, and the demise of such magazines as the <span class="italic">Welsh Review</span> and <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, which had published her, as for any decline in quality.<br>
<br>In 1953 Williams was diagnosed with a brain tumour and many of the writings of these last difficult years, still mainly unpublished, reflect her condition. &#145;The Nightingale Silenced&#146; (1954) is a moving account of the progress of her illness. A strong vein of nostalgia for her former life runs through her lyrical radio script &#145;December Day&#146;, broadcast in 1956. Her second volume of poetry, <span class="italic">A Candle Ahead</span> (1956), won a prize from the Welsh committee of the Arts Council a few weeks before she died at the Royal Kent and Sussex Hospital, Tunbridge Wells, on 17 March 1958, her forty-ninth birthday. She was buried at St Mary's Church, Hartfield, Sussex.<br>
<br>As a writer Margiad Evans defined herself as neither English nor Welsh but &#145;of the border&#146;, and the interrelation of two contrasting communities or personalities is a constant theme in her work. Although limited in geographical setting, and often reflecting personal experience, her writing touches concerns not restricted to a particular individual, time, or place. Both her prose and poetry, richly varied as they are in theme and treatment, are characterized by a keen sense of place and by strongly visual imagery, the latter informed by the graphic skills she continued to exercise in drawings and paintings, in her books and for friends and family. Since the 1990s courses in women's writing and in the English literature of Wales have revived interest in her work, leading to a new edition of <span class="italic">The Old and the Young</span> in 1998, and, in 2005, of <span class="italic">Country Dance</span> and <span class="italic">The Wooden Doctor</span>, as well as a centenary research conference in Aberystwyth in 2009.<br>
