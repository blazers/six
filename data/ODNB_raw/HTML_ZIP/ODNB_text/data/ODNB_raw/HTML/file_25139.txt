<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sewel,  Willem</span>  (1653&#150;1720), <span class="occ">translator, lexicographer, and historian of Quakerism</span>, was born in the Netherlands on 19 April 1653 at Angeliers Gracht, Amsterdam, probably the only child of Jakob Willemszoon Zewel (<i>d</i>. 1658/9), a surgeon, and his wife, Judith (<i>c</i>.1631&#150;1664), daughter of Conrad Zinspenning and his wife, Catherine. His paternal grandfather, William Sewel, was English. Sewel's parents, once prominent Mennonites, converted to Quakerism when he was four years old, and his birthplace became one of the earliest Quaker meeting places in Amsterdam. His mother became a notable Quaker minister and writer, and was probably the first Dutch female Quaker preacher. His early recollections of Quakerism in Amsterdam were to be incorporated in his later historical work. After his mother's death he lived with a maternal uncle and learnt Latin; there is no record of a formal education, and he was apprenticed to a weaver. In 1668 he made his only visit to England, lasting ten months: with other Dutch Friends he visited the Quaker leader Steven Crisp in prison in Ipswich and attended the funeral of Josiah Cole. On 19 February 1681 he married Jacomina (1661&#150;1703), daughter of Willem and Jannitze Boekenoogen of Alkmar; they had three daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Sewel's literary activities began at the end of his apprenticeship, by which time he had a working knowledge of English, French, German, and Latin. His translations, journalism, and editorial work for other authors were his main means of livelihood from the mid-1670s. He also did some teaching and acted from time to time as interpreter for visiting English Friends. He appears to have produced twenty-eight Dutch or Latin translations, of works in English, Flemish, French, German, Italian, and Latin; eight of these were Quaker publications. Apart from Quaker writings, Sewel translated works by Robert Boyle, Gilbert Burnett, William Congreve, Edmund Ludlow, Henry Sacheverell, William Sherlock, and Sir William Temple. He contributed to the Dutch translation of Sir Thomas Browne's collected works. He also edited a Dutch edition of his own mother's writings in 1684. Sewel's correspondence with William Penn shows him to have been a thoughtful and critical translator, willing to engage with the author on the content of the work. His translations and summaries of foreign news for <span class="italic">De Amsterdamsche Courant</span> from 1690 was followed by contributions to the <span class="italic">Nederlansche Courant</span>, and from 1702 to 1705 to <span class="italic">Tweemandelijke Uittreksels van alle eerst uytkomende Boeken</span> of Rotterdam and its successor, <span class="italic">Boekzaal der Geleerde Wereld</span>, which published his portrait in 1705.<br>
<br>Sewel's importance today rests on his linguistic and historical work. His <span class="italic">New Dictionary English and Dutch, [or,] Nieuw woordenboek der Nederduytsche en Engelsche taale</span>, published in Amsterdam in 1691 (revised in 1708), represents the second most important English and Dutch dictionary to be published in the period. It emerged from his extensive experience as a translator, alongside guides to the English and Dutch languages, a tract defending his own spelling system, and a Dutch grammar. Sewel worked largely from an English&#150;Latin dictionary, translating the Latin to Dutch, and from a Dutch&#150;French dictionary, translating the French to English. The dictionary gained from Sewel's need in his translating work to include specialist terminology of a learned, legal, and ecclesiastical nature, where there might be no obvious Dutch equivalent words. The 1708 revised edition took about four years to prepare: the English&#150;Dutch part was revised and supplemented on the basis of his recent translating work and the availability of a better English dictionary, while the Dutch&#150;English part was more thoroughly revised. The revised dictionary remained the standard throughout the eighteenth century and formed the basis of John Holtrop's dictionary of 1789.<br>
<br>Sewel was an active Friend, translating Quaker texts, engaging in defensive correspondence with anti-Quaker writers, and interpreting and participating in the general work of Dutch Friends. He began a correspondence in Latin with English Friends when he was twenty-three. In 1696 he declined an invitation from Penn to move to Bristol and take charge of a Friends' school there. His principal and enduring achievement for the Society of Friends was the substantial <span class="italic">Histori van de opkomste, annwas, en voortgang der Christenen, bekend by den naam van Quakers</span>, first published in Amsterdam in 1717 and then revised and translated by him as <span class="italic">The History of the Rise, Increase and Progress of the Christian People called Quakers</span> (1722). Sewel had been much involved with supplying material to Gerard Croese for his <span class="italic">Historia Quakeriana</span> (1695), but continued to collect on a wider scale for his own work. His correspondence with Croese makes clear his disappointment at the latter's numerous misinterpretations, and this may have been a catalyst for his own writing.<br>
<br>Sewel based his work on notes compiled over a long period, on the published sources he collected, and on correspondence with English Friends. The London yearly meeting appears to have gathered historical material to assist him once the English version was in prospect. His history attempted to set down, more comprehensively than previous accounts, an accurate record of the history of the Friends, and his use of George Fox's <span class="italic">Journal</span> may have had more influence in the eighteenth century than direct reading of the <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Material was added to, removed from, and edited, in the English version of the <span class="italic">History</span>, taking account of the views of the meeting for sufferings in London and playing down Sewel's original accounts of some of the extreme or eccentric behaviour by occasional early Friends. Regularly reprinted, his <span class="italic">History</span> remained a standard source until the early twentieth century, despite the publication of several other works in the intervening period.<br>
<br>Sewel died on 13 March 1720, probably in Amsterdam. Records of efforts by other Friends to help his children suggest that his estate was modest. His books, including the printed sources for the <span class="italic">History</span>, were left by his son to Friends in Amsterdam.<br>
