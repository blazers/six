<span class="headword">Manby,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633?, <em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was probably baptized on 30 May 1633 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the elder of the two children of Robert Manby and his wife, Susanna. Little is known about his life or career, but he was one of the earliest British artists to work in Italy, and was described by a contemporary as &#145;a good <i>English</i> Landskip-Painter, who had been several times in Italy, and consequently painted much after the <i>Italian</i> manner&#146;  (Buckeridge, 406). A group of eleven drawings (exh. Sothebys, 10 June 1931, lot 149) constitutes all that is known of his <i>&#339;uvre</i>. Italian views in pen and ink with grey wash, they chiefly depict the Roman Campagna. <span class="italic">The Ruins of the Colosseum</span> is in the Tate collection, and four others are in the British Museum. They show similarities to drawings by Francis Place, both men having been influenced by Dutch-Italianate artists such as Bartholomeus Breenbergh.<br>
<br>Manby was a friend of the portrait painter Mary Beale, and is mentioned several times in her husband's notebooks. On 16 February 1677 Charles Beale recorded that, in return for a landscape which Manby had added to Mary's portrait of the countess of Clare (after Lely), he was rewarding him with some expensive oil-pigments  (Beale, 1676/7). This portrait cannot now be identified, nor is it known whether Manby contributed further landscapes to works by Beale or other artists.<br>
<br>Manby acted as a picture dealer, and is recorded as having brought from Italy &#145;a good Collection of pictures&#146;, which were sold at the Banqueting House, Whitehall, <i>c</i>.1680  (Buckeridge, 406). He shared this interest with the sculptor Edward Pierce, and, following their deaths, a large group of their artworks were auctioned on 4 February 1696. The auction, held at the premises of John Cocks, the Golden Triangle, Long Acre, London, included books, drawings, prints, and models of plaster figures. Some lots are thought to have comprised works by Manby and Pierce as distinct from works they acquired in Italy.<br>
<br>Manby died in 1695, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 24 November.<br>
