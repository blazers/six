<span class="headword">Cl&eacute;risseau,  Charles-Louis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1721, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">architect and architectural draughtsman</span>, was baptized in Paris on 28 August 1721, the son of Jean Cl&eacute;risseau, seller of perfumed gloves, and his wife, Jeanne Rosselet. By 1745 he was attending the Acad&eacute;mie Royale d'Architecture as a pupil of the architect Gabriel-Germain Boffrand. In 1746 he won the grand prix, which led to three years' study in Rome as <i>pensionnaire</i> of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise. He arrived in Italy in 1749, and stayed there until 1767. On 1 December 1763 he married Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, daughter of the sculptor Pierre L'Estache (<i>c</i>.1688&#150;1774).<br>
<br>Cl&eacute;risseau was one of a succession of young architects and artists in Rome who, since the early 1740s, had been sowing the seeds of neo-classicism. He found his m&eacute;tier (and lifelong bread and butter) in the production of views, mainly in gouache, of real or idealized classical ruins. His contacts included friendships with Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Johann Joachim Winckelmann. While in Italy he acted as architectural mentor to Sir William Chambers, and, more significantly, to Robert and James Adam, thus profoundly influencing the course of neo-classicism in Britain. His contact with Chambers, datable to between 1751 and 1754, is recorded only in a lost drawing, begun by Chambers and finished by Cl&eacute;risseau, and some gossip from Robert Adam: &#145;I have also got acquaintance with one Cl&eacute;risseau who draws in architecture delightfully in the free manner I wanted.&#146; Chambers, he wrote, &#145;owes all hints and notions to this man with whom he differed and to whom he behaved ungratefully&#146;  (McCormick, 23). On arriving in Italy in 1755, Adam had placed himself entirely in Cl&eacute;risseau's hands. Cl&eacute;risseau both selected objects for study and taught Adam to draw in his characteristically picturesque manner. Adam saw that Cl&eacute;risseau's draughtsmanship could be useful for the publications essential to future success. A plan for a revised edition of A.-B. Desgodetz's <span class="italic">Edifices antiques de Rome</span> came to nothing, but in 1757, the year in which he left Italy, Adam engaged Cl&eacute;risseau on a regular basis for the production of most of the drawings and the arrangements for engraving his <span class="italic">Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian in Spalatro in Dalmatia</span>, published in 1764. In 1760&#150;61 James Adam also studied under Cl&eacute;risseau. By this time Robert's relationship with Cl&eacute;risseau had turned from one of admiring friendship to that of employer and employee&#151;Cl&eacute;risseau was refused extra money and proper recognition for his work on <span class="italic">Spalatro</span>.<br>
<br>In 1767 Cl&eacute;risseau left for France, and in 1769, as &#145;painter of architecture&#146;, became a member of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. In 1771 he moved to Britain, according to Edward Edwards at the invitation of Robert Adam, but also perhaps to be nearer the British patrons who were the principal admirers of his pictures. He exhibited four pictures, a bath and a sepulchral chamber &#145;composed after the manner of the Ancients&#146;, a view of the Forum of Nerva, and a triumphal arch, at the Royal Academy in 1772 (when living at Great Marlborough Street) and also exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1775, 1776, and 1790. Of design activities there is less evidence. There are drawings of ornament (RIBA) made by pupils, perhaps those of Robert Adam, but corrected by Cl&eacute;risseau. In 1774 he designed for Lansdowne House (an Adam project) a gallery (not executed), and an aedicule for the garden. Although his movements after 1771 are uncertain, Cl&eacute;risseau was certainly back in Paris by 1775, where he carried out schemes of interior decoration. In 1775 he designed a &#145;Roman house&#146; and a triumphal arch (unexecuted) for Catherine the Great, who made him her <i>premier architecte</i>. The Russian designs are among the 1170 Cl&eacute;risseau drawings bought by Catherine (The Hermitage, St Petersburg). The next largest collection is at Sir John Soane's Museum, London. In 1778 he designed his only major executed building, the Palais de Justice at Metz. In 1815 he was made a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, but his last twenty-five years were inactive. He died at his home, 14 rue Moli&egrave;re, Auteuil, outside Paris, on 19 January 1820, leaving an exceptional architectural library. Cl&eacute;risseau's difficult character and proud and prickly behaviour while doing business may account for the failure of many of his schemes.<br>
