<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fletcher,  Charles Montague</span>  (1911&#150;1995), <span class="occ">epidemiologist and broadcaster</span>, was born in Cambridge on 5 June 1911, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33177/', "Sir Walter Morley Fletcher FRS (1873&#150;1933)")</script>, of Burrels Field, Cambridge, fellow of Trinity College and first secretary of the Medical Research Council (MRC), and Mary Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cropper, from a prominent Cumbrian family. Following early schooling in London and Horsham, Sussex, he entered Eton College in 1924, becoming captain of Conybeare House and a member of the Etonian society, Pop, success as an oarsman and hurdler contributing to his early distinction. His decision to follow in the mould of his father's medical career led him towards the natural sciences, which he read between 1930 and 1934 at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father had been a physiology don. He completed his second MB and took a first in physiology in 1934, electing to defer clinical studies in order to undertake research in the field of electrophysiology. He described this Cambridge period as the idyllic years, which included the continuation of a prominent family association with the Pitt Club, a rowing blue in 1933, and a growth of interest in amateur dramatics and music. The best and the worst of years he might have described them, with the premature death of his father in 1933 &#145;the blackest of days&#146;.<br>
<br>Fletcher began clinical studies at London's St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school in 1936, supported by a personal scholarship created in memory of his father, who had studied there. One of the most elegant young men about town, Fletcher combined a remarkably full social calendar and scholastic distinction with apparent ease, being awarded the Henry Brackenbury prize for medicine in his final year. The outbreak of war took him to Emergency Medical Service sector hospitals on the outskirts of London, knitting socks for the troops as part of his own war effort, before joining Professor Leslie Witts's team at Oxford's Radcliffe Infirmary, first as house physician then Nuffield research fellow. During this period he helped Professor Howard Florey with the first clinical tests of a new therapeutic agent known as penicillin. On 17 January 1941 he administered the first injection of 100 mg of penicillin to a human subject. The results, which he described as miraculous, paved the way for its use by the allied forces in the latter years of the Second World War.<br>
<br>In the calendar of Fletcher's life 1941 was a momentous year, including the onset of diabetes mellitus, which excluded him from the armed forces, and the beginning of a lifelong partnership with Louisa Mary Sylvia (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36007/', "John Edward Bernard Seely, first Baron Mottistone (1868&#150;1947)")</script>, whom he married on 24 October. Soon afterwards he returned to St Bartholomew's (Barts) as registrar, transferring a year later to the British Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital, diagnostic investigations by gastroscopy forming the subject of his MD dissertation (1945). A strong supporter of the proposed national health service, his aspirations of becoming a staff physician at Barts were challenged by an invitation from the MRC to direct the ground breaking work of understanding the aetiology of pneumoconiosis within the mining valleys of south Wales. Twenty-five per cent of the coalminers were afflicted, with their lung capacity eroded. It was at Llandough Hospital, Cardiff, that Fletcher established, from scratch, a major research unit. Arguably his greatest achievement lay in recruiting an exceptionally able team, including Archie Cochrane, John Gilson, Philip Hugh-Jones, and Martin Wright, to the service of chest pathology and the unit's epidemiological surveys. Under his direction they achieved a new depth of understanding of pulmonary disease and its prevention. The unit also played a major role in drawing attention to the extent to which observer error plagued medical practice.<br>
<br>Regarding his period in Wales as a form of national service, compensating for lack of military service, Fletcher returned to the Hammersmith in 1952 as clinical lecturer in respiratory diseases. It did not prove the happiest of returns to mainstream medicine, seven years in Cardiff leaving him out of touch with clinical practice. He retreated increasingly into epidemiological surveys; it was a period of difficult adjustment and episodes of deep depression. It was, however, as a clinical epidemiologist that his career rose further, the great London smog of 1952&#150;3 stimulating a wave of research options. He became secretary to the MRC's bronchitis research committee (1954&#150;76), his own research including a major prospective study of bronchitis and emphysema among London's transport and Post Office workers. He also established a dialogue between North American and European physicians, who seriously lacked a consistent terminology. Until then doctors working in this field were not talking of the same diseases.<br>
<br>A skilled communicator himself, and undeterred by fierce opposition from members of the medical fraternity, Fletcher was already well known to the public through presentation of a range of television programmes on medical matters, notably <span class="italic">Hurt Minds</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Your Life in their Hands</span> (1958&#150;65). At the Royal College of Physicians, where he was elected vice-president in 1973, he drafted the first, ground breaking, report on smoking and health (1962) and was instrumental in founding the Council for Action on Smoking and Health (ASH). He continued to campaign for better communication in medicine, the topic of an inspiring Rock Carling lecture (1972) and future publications. In retirement he enjoyed gardening and bee-keeping at his home on the Isle of Wight, remaining actively involved with a number of research charities and in the field of medical ethics, but no longer holding the strong religious beliefs of his youth inspired by his mother's moral crusading within the Oxford Group. Early in his career, following his pneumoconiosis studies in Wales, he was appointed CBE. Some have speculated that his outspoken lobbying against the tobacco industry, or his popular television image, denied him higher honours. Even his personal chair in clinical epidemiology (1973&#150;6) may be regarded as rather delayed in arriving. But in advancing the public understanding of medicine more than any other physician of his generation and playing a leading role in unmasking tobacco, a lifetime feeling that he would never match his father's achievements turned out not to be justified. He died at his London home, 24 West Square, Kennington, on 15 December 1995, survived by his wife and three children. Friends and professional colleagues were among those who attended his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral on 21 March 1996.<br>
