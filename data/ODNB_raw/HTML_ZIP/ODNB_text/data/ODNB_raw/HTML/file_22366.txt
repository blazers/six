<span class="headword">Playfair,  James</span>  (1738&#150;1819), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and writer on geography</span>, was born on 19 December 1738, the second son of George Playfair, a farmer of West Bendochy, Perthshire, and his wife, Jean Roger, both of whom were Scottish. After studying theology at the University of St Andrews, whence he matriculated in February 1755, he was licensed as a probationer on 1 November 1770 and served as pastor to a Presbyterian congregation at Newtyle, Forfarshire, north-west of Dundee. On 30 September 1773 he married Margaret Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1831), the elder daughter of a Forfarshire clergyman. They had two daughters and four sons, who included the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22365/', "Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair")</script>; their son George was the father of Lyon Playfair, first Baron Playfair of St Andrews, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22369/', "Sir Robert Lambert Playfair")</script>.<br>
<br>On 19 June 1777 Playfair was reassigned from Newtyle to nearby Meigle. After further study he received the degree of doctor of divinity from the University of St Andrews on 2 July 1779. It is said that he was repeatedly offered the post of moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland; if so he never accepted this prestigious office.<br>
<br>On 20 August 1800, in his sixty-second year, Playfair was appointed principal of the United College, St Andrews, and minister of the church of St Leonard's in the same city. He was also historiographer to the prince of Wales for many years but few details concerning that employment have survived. In 1809 he allowed himself the uncharacteristic pleasure of publishing a pseudonymous satire on George Hill, principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews, entitled &#145;The last speech, confession and dying words of dominus defunctus, sometime inquisitor of the city of Juxtamare&#146;.<br>
<br>It was primarily in St Andrews that Playfair's major literary labours were undertaken. These include a two-volume <span class="italic">System of Chronology</span> (1784); a six-volume <span class="italic">System of Geography, Ancient and Modern</span> (1810&#150;14); a four-volume <span class="italic">General Atlas, Ancient and Modern</span> (1814); and a two-volume <span class="italic">Geographical and Statistical Description of Scotland</span> (1819). Of these much-laboured compilations only the last remains of interest today. It is based almost entirely on the multi-volume <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (1791&#150;9) by Sir John Sinclair, to which Playfair had contributed accounts of the parishes of Meigle, Essie, and Nevay. In passages original to his own book Playfair described how he had tunnelled into &#145;Dunsinnan hill&#146; to discover remains of Macbeth's fortress (demolished in 1057). He defended the authenticity of Ossian's poems and praised Burns but ignored Scott, who was not yet known as the author of the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels but had written highly popular long poems on Scottish themes. Playfair also commented interestingly on changes in the dress and manners of the highlanders since 1745. He died at Dalmarnock, near Glasgow, on 26 May 1819, soon after his book had come out. His widow died at St Andrews on 4 November 1831.<br>
