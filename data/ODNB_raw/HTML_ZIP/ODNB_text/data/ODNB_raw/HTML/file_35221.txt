<span class="headword">Newton,  Alfred</span>  (1829&#150;1907), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 11 June 1829 at Les D&eacute;lices, Geneva, the fifth son in the family of six boys and four girls born to William Newton (1782&#150;1862) of Elveden, Suffolk, plantation owner and MP, and Elizabeth (1789&#150;1843), daughter of Richard Slater Milnes of Fryston, MP for York. The family, of Lincolnshire origin, moved to Elveden in 1813 from their sugar plantations in St Croix in the West Indies, which they retained. William Newton was MP for Ipswich; he was also a JP in Norfolk. Alfred was born as they returned from a holiday in Italy. His closest family relationship was with his younger brother, Edward, who shared his lifelong interest in birds and to whom he wrote almost daily in his adult years. A childhood fall from a table in Elveden Library caused a permanent lameness in Alfred's right leg, necessitating his use of a stick. In 1882 he ruptured the tendon in his left leg and thereafter remained, in his words, &#145;a four-legged man&#146;  (Wollaston, 279&#150;80).<br>
<br>Newton entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1848, won two successive annual English essay prizes, and graduated BA in 1853. Election to the Drury travelling fellowship allowed him ten years of ornithological study. With John Wolley, he visited northern Scandinavia (1855) and went to Iceland (1858) in search of the last nesting place of the great auk. He visited the West Indies and North America in 1857 and Madeira in 1862. In the latter year he abandoned his long-held intention to take holy orders, a decision he never regretted. He was already at the forefront of ornithology, having played a leading role in founding the British Ornithologists' Union (1858) and its journal <span class="italic">Ibis</span>. He drew attention to Wolley's studies after the latter died in 1859 and began to catalogue the collection of eggs which Wolley bequeathed to him. The first volume of the massive <span class="italic">Ootheca Wolleyana</span> was published in 1864 but so cautious and painstaking were Newton's working methods that further volumes did not appear until 1902, 1905, and 1907.<br>
<br>In 1864 Newton visited Spitsbergen. Thereafter his travels were confined to summer voyages around the coasts of the British Isles in search of seabirds with Henry Evans. This was largely due to his appointment as professor in the new chair of zoology and comparative anatomy at Cambridge in March 1866; he held this office until his death. At Cambridge he took seriously the task of developing this embryonic discipline into a rigorous science. It is unlikely that a better candidate could have been found. Always resident during term-time, he was prominent in university affairs and greatly expanded the university's zoological museum by his personal patronage. He presented both his own and Wolley's extensive collections of birds' eggs, partly perhaps because the cotton wool in which they were stored aggravated his hay fever. He knew himself to be one of the worst lecturers, reading from notes in a desperately dry fashion (and later appointing William Bateson to lecture for him). However, he encouraged every undergraduate with any interest in natural history and the informal Sunday evening talks in his rooms became a fond memory for many renowned zoologists. Among his plain furniture, threadbare carpets, and drab wallpaper, surrounded by piles of books and papers in which he could readily find any item he sought, he was always ready with a humorous story or with considered advice and opinion given with the admirable clarity of expression which also marked his writings.<br>
<br>Newton contributed to many journals and books, including the article on ornithology in the ninth edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He edited <span class="italic">Ibis</span> from 1865 to 1870, after which other work curtailed his active involvement in the British Ornithologists' Union; the <span class="italic">Zoological Record</span> (1871&#150;3), for which he declined payment, so concerned was he to see it succeed; and volumes 1 and 2 of Yarrell's <span class="italic">British Birds</span> (1871 and 1882). His methodical insistence on accuracy frustrated the publishers and, refusing to be rushed, he relinquished responsibility for the final two volumes. Preparation of his greatest work was also ponderous but the four-volume <span class="italic">Dictionary of Birds</span> (1893&#150;6) was a precise, thorough, and succinct exposition of contemporary ornithology.<br>
<br>Newton took particular interest in extinct species such as the dodo and the great auk, and the great bustard which had recently disappeared from Britain, so it was as natural that he should have championed protective legislation as it was that his leadership should have been so level-headed, treading a line between his sympathy for egg collectors and his wariness of misguided sentimentalists. His paper to the British Association at Norwich in 1868 led directly to the first of many protective acts, the 1869 <span class="roman">Sea Birds Preservation Act</span>. He served on the council of the British Association and chaired its committee for studying bird migration (1880&#150;1903). He was vice-president of the Zoological Society and the Royal Society, being elected FRS in 1870 and receiving its medal, and that of the Linnean Society, in 1900. He provided the fledgeling Society for the Protection of Birds with its first guinea in 1889.<br>
<br>Despite his two sticks, Newton was noted for his strong, lofty build, alert countenance, and bushy side whiskers. His outward lack of emotion and sometimes grim exterior hid a warm heart and a kind, courteous, and faithful personality with a deep affection for and understanding of others. He disliked untruthfulness and prevarication, and could not abide inaccuracy. He was critical in the best sense of the word. Fiercely independent both in contending with his physical disability and in his thoughts, he was utterly opposed to change in many things, expressing his opinions forcefully, for example, on alterations to dining practices at Magdalene and the introduction into the college chapel of both women and music. Yet he took defeat with grace and good humour and never indulged in subsequent criticism or recrimination. He was perhaps more liberal, though never incautious, in scientific matters. He quickly embraced Darwin's theory of evolution and Michael Foster's experimental methods in physiology. His wisdom and inspiration had a lasting impact on the science of ornithology. He never married. On 7 June 1907, in his rooms in the Old Lodge at Magdalene, his heart failed following a bout of dropsy. He was buried in St Giles's cemetery, Huntingdon Road, Cambridge.<br>
