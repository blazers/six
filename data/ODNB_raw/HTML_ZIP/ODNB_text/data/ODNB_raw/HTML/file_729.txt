<span class="headword">Asbury,  Francis</span>  (1745&#150;1816), <span class="occ">a founder of the American Methodist Episcopal church</span>, was born on 20 August 1745 at Hamstead Bridge, in the parish of Handsworth, Staffordshire. He was the only son of Joseph Asbury and Eliza Rogers, both farmers and devout followers of Methodism. He was educated at a local school until the age of twelve; he began to preach, as a local preacher, at the age of eighteen, and having been admitted as an itinerant preacher at the age of twenty-one, travelled throughout Staffordshire and Worcestershire. In August 1771, when preachers were wanted by the Bristol conference to go to America, Asbury offered himself: he arrived at Philadelphia in October 1771.<br>
<br>During the American War of Independence, British Methodists were vocally opposed to American revolutionary activity. As a result, Methodists in America endured substantial hardships; however, Asbury stayed, while all other Methodist missionaries returned to Britain. He avoided politics and never became a citizen of the United States. During the Christmas conference of 1784 in Baltimore, the American Methodists split formally from the Wesleyan societies in Britain to form the Methodist Episcopal church of the United States of America. Asbury was elected a joint superintendent with Thomas Coke, and he adopted the title of bishop at Coke's suggestion. Asbury continued his rigorous travel schedule, visiting each state almost every year. During his travels in North America, he preached an estimated 17,000 sermons of one hour or more and travelled over 275,000 miles. Under him the Methodist church grew from 15,000 members in 1784 to 140,000 members, stretching from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.<br>
<br>Asbury's journal, published posthumously in 1821, shows him to have been a man of simple and winning character, administrative power, and effective expression; his piety was both frank and deep. Other published work included <span class="italic">The Causes, Evils and Cures of Heart and Church Divisions</span> (1792) and <span class="italic">Extracts of Letters Containing some Account of the Work of God since the Year 1800</span> (1805). He died, unmarried, on 31 March 1816, in Spotsylvania, Virginia. His salary never exceeded $80, and at his death he left his estate of $2000 to the book concern of his church. His tireless efforts were remembered in the naming of the town Asbury Park, New Jersey, and of Asbury Theological Seminary and Asbury College, both in Wilmore, Kentucky.<br>
