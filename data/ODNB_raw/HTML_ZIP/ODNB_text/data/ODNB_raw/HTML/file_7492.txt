<span class="headword">Denison, Sir  William Thomas</span>  (1804&#150;1871), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, the third son of John Denison (1758?&#150;1820), of Ossington, Nottinghamshire, and his second wife, Charlotte Estwick, was born in London on 3 May 1804. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7490/', "(John) Evelyn Denison (1800&#150;1873)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7486/', "Edward Denison (1801&#150;1854)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7488/', "George Anthony Denison (1805&#150;1896)")</script> were his brothers. After attending a private school at Sunbury he spent four years at Eton College, and then studied under a private tutor, the Revd C. Drury. In February 1819 he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He passed for the Royal Engineers in 1823, but did not receive his commission as lieutenant until 1826, having spent part of the interval in working at the Ordnance Survey.<br>
<br>Following instruction at Chatham, Denison was sent in 1827 to Canada, where during the following four years he was employed with a company of sappers in the construction of the Rideau Canal. While on this duty he made experiments to test the strength of various kinds of American timber, as a result of which the Institution of Civil Engineers voted him the Telford medal and appointed him an associate. After returning to England at the end of 1831 he served at Woolwich, and in February 1833 was appointed instructor of the engineer cadets at Chatham, where he established a small observatory. In 1835 he was appointed a member of the municipal corporation boundary commission, and the following year he was employed at Greenwich in making observations with Ramsden's zenith sector. In the autumn of 1837 he was appointed engineer in charge of the works at Woolwich Dockyard, and in 1841 was promoted captain. He worked for the Admiralty at Woolwich and Portsmouth, and in 1842 visited Bermuda to inspect the dockyard works; in all three places he gained experience in dealing with convict labour. During these years Denison paid considerable attention to scientific and professional studies; at Woolwich he originated the publication of the professional papers of the Royal Engineers in 1837, and edited them until he left. In 1844&#150;5 he served as an engineer on the royal commission on the health of towns, whose report was the basis of British health legislation for twenty-five years.<br>
<br>In June 1846 Denison was nominated lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land on the recommendation of Sir John Burgoyne, inspector-general of fortifications, whom the colonial secretary, W. E. Gladstone, had asked to nominate an officer of engineers qualified for the post. Gladstone's successor, Lord Grey, confirmed the appointment, and Denison, knighted that year for his services under the Admiralty, sailed for Hobart Town on 13 October; he arrived there on 25 January 1847.<br>
<br>The colony was in a somewhat disorganized condition. The excessive number of convicts transported between 1842 and 1845 had caused a large deficit in the Treasury, a crisis in the convict department, and the recall of Sir John Eardley-Wilmot for his incompetent administration. Denison was told that no convicts would be sent for two years, which would give him time to reform the department (helped by a new controller, Dr. J. S. Hampton). But Grey wanted to resume transportation in 1848 and was delighted to find Denison then convinced that convict labour was desirable to undertake the public works he wanted to carry out, to relieve the labour shortage, and to keep down wages. However, Denison faced strong and growing opposition from members of the Anti-Transportation League, which he foolishly described as &#145;a farce&#146;. Led by the Revd John West, whom Denison intolerantly described in a letter to Deas Thomson in Sydney as &#145;a dirty dog with whom no gentleman would associate&#146;  (West, xvii), in 1851 the league's supporters won every elective seat in the legislative council. However, the discovery of gold on the mainland, together with prison building and less perceived crime at home, convinced Lord Stanley's tory administration in 1852 that imperial convicts should no longer be transported to Van Diemen's Land. Denison was disappointed, but the decision removed a major source of opposition to him, and in 1854 he earned further praise by closing the much criticized penal establishment on Norfolk Island.<br>
<br>Denison had been criticized for high-handedness in making appointments to the legislative council, in trying to dismiss Chief Justice Pedder after the supreme court had declared the <span class="roman">Dog Tax Act</span> invalid in 1847, and the following year in authorizing expenditure which the legislative council had rejected. He was fortunate in that, although Grey censured him for acting &#145;rashly and unadvisedly&#146;, he tempered his criticism of these &#145;errors of judgment&#146; by praise for Denison's &#145;zeal and ability&#146;  (Denison, 1.98). This he had shown in dealing with the convicts, by successfully asserting over Bishop Nixon the crown's right to nominate Anglican clergy as convict chaplains, and by establishing in 1853 a board of education to control undenominational schools. These he thought should be based on &#145;religious principles&#146; but not necessarily on &#145;religious opinions&#146;, and they would supplement the existing denominational schools&#151;though he was unable to persuade the legislative council to authorize local rates to pay for them. He paid great attention to the orphan school and he established local councils in Hobart Town and Launceston. When the Crimean War broke out in 1854 he ordered the construction of batteries for the defence of Hobart's harbour and trained the police to act as gunners. He continued to show an interest in science, succeeded in negotiating a union between the rival Royal and Tasmanian societies, became the patron of the new Royal Society, and contributed six papers to the first volume of the latter's journal. In the 1854 debates on the new constitution to be granted to Van Diemen's Land he criticized the prevailing &#145;democratic spirit&#146; and the character of the colonists and pressed for a nominated upper house; this was rejected, but he gained agreement for a very restrictive franchise for an elective council and a not very liberal one for the legislative assembly.<br>
<br>On 29 November 1838 Denison had married Caroline Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1899), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13787/', "Admiral Sir Phipps Hornby")</script>. She accompanied him on all his postings, and over the years they had thirteen children; domestic life at Government House contrasted favourably with that of his predecessor, Sir John Eardley-Wilmot, whose conduct had occasioned gossip in Hobart and concern at the Colonial Office. But Denison's strength lay in his administrative ability, which also contrasted sharply with Eardley-Wilmot's, and it was that which brought him promotion to New South Wales, where he assumed office as governor-general in January 1855&#151;described in his journal as &#145;a very great appointment for so <i>young a Governor</i>&#146;  (Denison, 1.256).<br>
<br>The title of governor-general of Australia which went with the governorship of New South Wales was nothing more than a name. Denison himself opposed it, and his lack of power was shown in the limited role he was able to play in the inter-colonial negotiations about tariffs, the Murray River border convention of 1855, and the subsidizing of a steam postal service to the United Kingdom. He did nothing to prevent New South Wales and Victoria adopting different railway gauges, and he opposed Lord Grey's proposals to establish a federal system in Australia, telling the secretary of state that if &#145;a general assembly&#146; of the local colonies were established it &#145;would have nothing to do&#146;  (Denison, 1.262). But being governor of New South Wales was a different matter, and Denison retained this office until 1861. Shortly after his arrival in Sydney he had introduced the new system of constitutional or responsible government there. He did not like it, and complained on 31 October 1859 that during three and a half years he had had five sets of ministers, by whom &#145;not one measure of social improvement had been passed, and the only acts of importance that had stood the ordeal were those of very questionable advantage&#146;  (Denison, 1.467). He wanted to diminish what he thought were the evils of a low qualification by dividing the country into large electoral districts, each returning several members, and limiting the right of voting to one vote so as to give more scope for the representation of various interests and of property.<br>
<br>Denison emphatically deprecated the disposition to regard the colonies rather as an encumbrance than as a benefit to the empire. He was opposed to the formation of a colonial military force as likely to be expensive and ill disciplined, but in 1855 hastened the building of Fort Denison in Sydney harbour and installed other batteries for its defence. He was happy to send some of its imperial troops both to India during the mutiny and to New Zealand during the wars there&#151;though he was sympathetic to the Maori grievances after his visit to New Zealand in 1857. He held that the prevention of crime was the main object of punishment, and objected to &#145;maudlin sentimentality&#146; in dealing with criminals; he considered that sentences should be fully and strictly enforced, and that imprisonment should invariably, even in the case of prisoners awaiting trial, be accompanied by labour. In this, in 1858, the New South Wales government adopted his views at least partially. Denison took much personal interest in the return of the Pitcairn islanders, the descendants of the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i>, to Norfolk Island, twice visiting it and investigating various matters connected with the well-being of the islanders. In 1856 he was created a civil KCB.<br>
<br>In September 1860 the imperial government decided to appoint Denison governor of the Madras presidency, and in January 1861 he left for this post. Immediately on assuming office, on 18 February, he had to consider a plan for reorganizing the Sepoy army. He thought it radically unsound, and predicted that the proposal to link promotion to length of service would lead before long to an excessive proportion of field officers, while the irregular system, depending for its efficiency on exceptional capacity in the officers, was utterly unsuitable for an entire army. Five years later he thought it had been &#145;in every way injurious&#146;. He also opposed the retention of separate armies for Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, and here he anticipated a report of the Indian army commission, but the home government rejected it. He was against the establishment of legislative councils in the minor presidencies and provinces and the introduction of Indians into those councils, holding that these measures would lead to demands for representation and were not really desired by the Indians. He deprecated the cry of &#145;India for the Indians&#146;, and emphatically condemned &#145;the theory that we are acting as tutors to teach the Hindoos to govern themselves&#146;, which he characterized as &#145;sentimental trash&#146;. He speedily formed an unduly low opinion of the native character. He was opposed to the recently introduced system of open competition for admission into the covenanted civil service, insisting that, above all else, officers should be gentlemen, and he disapproved of the settlement of Europeans in India, as they were likely to get into trouble with the Indians.<br>
<br>Denison again gave much attention to public works. He recognized the great value of irrigation and of improved communications, although he deemed the railways being built needlessly expensive. He reorganized the public works department, and took issue with the employment of officers of the Royal Engineers on civil duties. He passed a town improvement act in 1865 and tried to promote the improvement of agriculture and the revision of the principles on which the land revenue should be assessed.<br>
<br>Following the death of Lord Elgin, in the latter part of 1863, Denison was called on to assume temporarily the office of governor-general; he was then able to recall an order for the withdrawal of the troops then engaged on the Sitana expedition, a measure which he thought could not have failed to affect injuriously Britain's military prestige.<br>
<br>Denison retired from the Madras government in March 1866. In 1868 he was appointed chairman of a royal commission to consider the pollution of British rivers, a position he held until his death, at Observatory House, Mortlake, East Sheen, Surrey, on 19 January 1871.<br>
<br>His abilities were solid rather than brilliant, but his great industry and unimpeachable integrity made him a distinguished public servant. A keen scientist, in Sydney he had urged the imperial government to compile a natural history of the British colonies; in Madras he wanted a natural history of India. He corresponded with Sir Roderick Murchison on geography and population. With the strong religious convictions of a fundamentalist Anglican, he decidedly rejected the theories of Charles Darwin and wrote a criticism of <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> and an essay on the antiquity of man; he showed little interest in &#145;humane&#146; disciplines which might have modified his severe judgements, though a tendency towards arrogance was modified in his private life, where he was warm-hearted and generous.<br>
