<span class="headword">Collins,  Charles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1744), <span class="occ">bird and mammal painter</span>, of whose parents nothing is known, lived and worked in London. George Vertue noted that he &#145;painted all sorts of fowl and game. He drew a piece with a hare and birds and his own portrait in a hat&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, 2.122). He used watercolour when making records of single species of birds and mammals for patrons, and he painted still life and composite pictures in oil. A set of twelve oil paintings of landscapes with British birds was used as the basis for a set of twelve oblong folio etched prints, without text, published under the title <span class="italic">Icones avium cum nominibus anglicis: designed by Charles Collins, published by him and John Lee according to the act of parl. Sept 29th 1736</span>. Six were engraved by Henry Fletcher and six by James Mynde. Nine of the original oil paintings are at Anglesey Abbey, Cambridgeshire; the remaining three were sold at Sothebys, London, in July 1995 from the collection of the Gilby family. The set included 114 figures of birds flying, preening, and perching, in landscapes with cottages or river landscapes. Collins's bird figures are more lively and better drawn than those of his contemporaries Eleazar Albin, George Edwards, and Peter Paillou, though they are not as natural and convincing as those of the Flemish artist Pieter Casteels, who issued a similar set of twelve prints from his oil paintings under the title <span class="italic">Icones avium</span> (<i>c</i>.1726). Collins also painted several still lifes in oil of dead birds.<br>
<br>Many of Collins's watercolour studies were made from stuffed birds in the collection of Taylor White of Wallingwells, Nottinghamshire, a judge on the north Wales circuit and an enthusiastic, wealthy collector of curios and natural history specimens. He commissioned Collins, Peter Paillou, and others to paint records of the live and stuffed birds and mammals in his collection, resulting in a long series of 659 watercolours which included 201 signed bird paintings by Collins (including a dodo) and some unsigned mammal paintings. Each bird drawing had one figure subject in a conventional composition with a grassy mound or stump; but Collins attempted to make his models appear alive and active. They were very well coloured, with the addition of delicate highlights on the soft feathering. Most of the signed drawings are dated 1737&#150;9, but many others in his style are neither signed nor dated. This, the largest collection of his work, is in the Blacker Wood Library at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec.<br>
<br>A preparatory watercolour study of a buzzard by Collins was used by Thomas Pennant for an illustration in his <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> (1766). The watercolour for the buzzard (<span class="italic">Buteo buteo</span>), signed and dated 1739 (Cecil Higgins Art Gallery, Bedford), is particularly fine. With their finely detailed plumage of dead birds, and their sombre colouring, Collins's still-life paintings were done in the style of the Dutch old masters, as seen, for example, in <span class="italic">Lobster on a Delft Dish</span> (1738, Tate collection). He frequently signed and dated his compositions. Charles Collins died in London in 1744. Examples of his work are in the collections of the British Museum, London; City of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin; Leeds City Art Gallery; and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.<br>
