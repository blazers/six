<span class="headword">Alexandra, Princess</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Princess Arthur of Connaught]</span>, <i>suo jure</i> duchess of Fife  (1891&#150;1959), <span class="occ">nurse and granddaughter of Edward VII</span>, was born Alexandra Victoria Alberta Edwina Louise on 17 May 1891 at East Sheen Lodge, Richmond, Surrey. She was the elder daughter and second child of Alexander William George Duff, first duke of Fife (1849&#150;1912), and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34602/', "Princess Louise Victoria Alexandra Dagmar (1867&#150;1931)")</script>, eldest daughter of Edward VII. Her birth followed that of a stillborn son the year before. Her father, formerly the sixth Earl Fife, was created a duke by Queen Victoria when he married in 1889, and in 1900 he was granted letters patent to enable his dukedom to be inherited by Alexandra and then by her sister Maud (born in 1893).<br>
<br>Alexandra was known as Lady Alexandra Duff until 1905, when the king declared that she and Maud should bear the title of princess and style of highness with precedence after the royal highnesses. Her mother, being reclusive, kept Alexandra and Maud away from the rest of the royal family and they were brought up quietly at home.<br>
<br>In August 1910 Alexandra's meddlesome spinster aunt Princess Victoria arranged for her first cousin, the myopic Prince Christopher of Greece, to be invited to Mar Lodge, the Fifes' estate near Braemar. Princess Victoria assured the duke of Fife that Christopher would not propose, but neglected to inform the hopeful suitor. During the visit the young couple became secretly betrothed, though the duke of Fife soon forbade the union. Prince Christopher concluded that they were both &#145;more in love with love than with each other&#146;  (Christopher, prince of Greece, 97).<br>
<br>In November 1911 the Fife family set off aboard the P. &amp; O. liner <i>Delhi</i> for their annual winter holiday in Egypt. In the early hours of 13 December their ship ran ashore off Cape Spartel. They were rescued, but the rescue boat sank and Alexandra was struck by a wave full in the face. She felt the water rush up her nose and swallowed it in gulps. As she wrote later, &#145;This is death, I thought&#146;  (Alexandra, <span class="italic">Egypt and Khartoum</span>, 9). However, she was rescued by a doctor and dragged, &#145;a soaking, sodden mess&#146;  (ibid., 10), to the beach. They then undertook a 10 mile ride on mules to Tangier, where they rested before continuing to Egypt and the Sudan.<br>
<br>On their way to Khartoum, Alexandra's father caught a chill and died at Aswan on 29 January 1912. Alexandra succeeded her father as duchess of Fife in her own right. She later wrote: &#145;I could never have the same love or admiration for any other man, and I never did&#146;  (Alexandra, <span class="italic">Egypt and Khartoum</span>, 54). She assumed responsibility for her mother and sister, and took a keen interest in the welfare of her tenants in Scotland.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1913, at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, she married her cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30461/', "Arthur Frederick Patrick Albert, Prince Arthur of Connaught (1883&#150;1938)")</script>, and on 9 August 1914, their son, Alastair Arthur, earl of Macduff, was born. The outbreak of the First World War gave her the opportunity to realize a childhood ambition to nurse. She worked at St Mary's, Paddington, and qualified as a state registered nurse in 1919. She was awarded first prize for a paper on eclampsia (convulsions in late pregnancy), and especially enjoyed working in casualty.<br>
<br>In 1920 Alexandra accompanied Prince Arthur to South Africa, where he served as governor-general until 1923. She found life there restricting, and hated having to be polite when she was shown round badly run hospitals. Her only relief was their annual holiday, hunting big game in Rhodesia.<br>
<br>In 1923 the Fife family suffered serious financial repercussions from the death of the duke's business partner Lord Farquhar, who had left Princess Arthur a large bequest, including 7 Grosvenor Square, a diamond necklace, and the residue of his property. But Farquhar proved to be bankrupt and, as a co-trustee of the Fife estates, Alexandra's mother was obliged to sell a great number of pictures and other possessions to make good an &pound;80,000 shortfall. Alexandra herself remained a rich woman and continued to run the Mar Lodge estate, near Braemar, where she spent her summers. She became a keen angler and field-sports enthusiast: in 1939 she killed seventy-five stags in a week. Eventually she bequeathed the estate to her husband's nephew Captain Alexander Ramsay, but the furniture to her own nephew Lord Carnegie, who succeeded her as the third duke of Fife.<br>
<br>On her return to London in 1923, Alexandra became a nurse at University College Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital, using the name Nurse Marjorie. She performed minor operations as well as being a competent operating theatre nurse, and once amputated a patient's thumb. In July 1925 she was appointed a lady of the Royal Red Cross. In the Second World War, by which time she was a widow, Alexandra became sister in charge of the casualty clearing station of the 2nd London General Hospital. Subsequently she opened the Fife Nursing Home in Bentinck Street, which she equipped and financed herself. She served as matron for ten years, caring for patients who included actors, acrobats, film critics, dressmakers, and, as she put it, enigmatically, &#145;a (great) Prime Minister&#146;  (Alexandra, <span class="italic">A Nurse's Story</span>).<br>
<br>After the early death of her husband on 12 September 1938, the tragic death of her son in 1943, and that of her sister in 1945, Alexandra fell victim to crippling rheumatoid arthritis and took no further part in public life after March 1946. She continued to live in Avenue Road, north of Regent's Park, and was taken for drives in her special ambulance car. In the 1950s she renewed a childhood friendship with her first cousin the duke of Windsor, who visited her and arranged for supplies of the drugs hydrocortone and meticorten to be delivered to her from the Schering Corporation in America, with the approval of her doctor, Sir Horace Evans. These alleviated her suffering, though she adjured the duke that her name must not be used for publicity by the manufacturer. During these years, Alexandra was able to publish the volumes of memoirs <span class="italic">A Nurse's Story</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Egypt and Khartoum</span> (1956). At the time of her death she was working on a history of big game hunting.<br>
<br>Princess Alexandra could have been one of the most prominent members of the royal family, but her preference for nursing and a certain inherent shyness kept her largely out of the public gaze, although she did serve as councillor of state during the absences abroad of George VI in 1939, 1943, and 1944. Her official title, Princess Arthur of Connaught, retained a certain resonance and even scored a mention in Sandy Wilson's popular musical <span class="italic">The Boyfriend</span>.<br>
<br>Alexandra died at her home, 64 Avenue Road, St John's Wood, London, on 26 February 1959. She was cremated and her ashes were buried in the chapel at Mar Lodge on 3 March.<br>
