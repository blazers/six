<span class="headword">Collier,  Giles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Norton, near Evesham, Worcestershire, and baptized there on 13 October 1622, the son of Giles Collier. In 1637 he entered New Inn Hall, Oxford, as a battler or servitor and graduated BA in 1641. Having left Oxford he proceeded MA in 1648 at the time of the parliamentary visitation. At the end of the first civil war of 1642&#150;6 Collier &#145;clos[ed] then with the Presbyterians&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1171). He took the covenant in 1648. In May 1646 he became rector of Aston Somerville, Worcestershire, and in 1647 he became vicar of Blockley, Gloucestershire. He also kept a school in his vicarage at Blockley.<br>
<br>When the Worcestershire association of ministers was formed in 1652 Collier was one of the earliest members. He was also one of the leading members of the Evesham branch of the association. He became an assistant to the Worcestershire ejectors in 1654.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1655 Collier wrote to Richard Baxter, then in London, asking Baxter to stay with him on his way back to Kidderminster. He also remarked on the &#145;inconvenience&#146; of &#145;idle profane ignorant curates&#146; being allowed &#145;to creepe into our Parishes and baptize etc with the <span class="roman">Common praier booke</span>&#146;. Next Collier stressed &#145;how expedient 'tis that a law be made against the observation of Christmas, hereby Episcopal men their keeping it up will be at an end, whereby our ignorant and superstitious people are much hard'ned against us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 162&#150;3). In an appendix of 1656 to his <span class="italic">Vindiciae thesium de sabato</span> (1653) Collier argued, against his clerical neighbour Edward Fisher of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, that there was no valid reason for the keeping of Christmas.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Collier, to the surprise and chagrin of neighbouring &#145;episcopal men&#146;, conformed and so kept the living of Blockley. The years before his death in 1678 were marked by a feud with his parishioner Thomas Childe of Northwick and by attempts to prosecute other parishioners for working on the sabbath. In a letter of 27 June 1678 to the Oxford mathematician John Wallis he wrote that two of his daughters had died of smallpox. His own death occurred in July 1678 and he was buried on 31 July in the chancel of Blockley church.<br>
<br>In his will of 27 July 1678 Collier mentioned his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1695), possibly the daughter of William Stephens of Broadway who was baptized in 1621, and his sons Stephen and Nathaniel, both clerks in holy orders. To Nathaniel he left Matthew Poole's <span class="italic">Synopsis criticorum</span>; to his &#145;daughter Hering&#146; he left &#145;the Reversion at Littleton [near Evesham] purchased of my Father Stephens&#146;. There was also an unspecified bequest of money to &#145;the honest Poore of Blockley, such who being able do ordinarily come to Church&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/358).<br>
