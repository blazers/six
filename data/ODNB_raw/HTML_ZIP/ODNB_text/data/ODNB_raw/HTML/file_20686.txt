<span class="headword">Oldham,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1592, <em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">trader and colonist in America</span>, was baptized at All Saints', Derby, Derbyshire, on 14 July 1592, the son of William Oldham. Nothing else is known of his early life until he sailed to Plymouth, New England, in 1623 on the <i>Anne</i>, with his wife (the widow of one Bridges), his stepson William Bridges, and at least seven other associates. Although his sister Lucretia married, at Plymouth, Jonathan Brewster, son of the separatist leader <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3376/', "William Brewster")</script>, Oldham was one of the early Plymouth residents who were not associated with the Leiden congregation, and had no interest in promoting the religious activities of that group. Instead, he allied himself in 1624 with the newly arrived John Lyford, a Church of England clergyman and not a separatist. Oldham, Lyford, and others were soon banished from Plymouth, settled briefly at Nantasket, and then dispersed. By 1628 Oldham had redeemed himself sufficiently in the eyes of the Plymouth authorities that he was assigned the job of escorting back to England in 1628 the troublemaker Thomas Morton of Merrymount. While in England in 1629 Oldham approached the Council for New England and obtained a grant of land in Massachusetts Bay, which conflicted with the grant made by the king to the Massachusetts Bay Company. This led, not surprisingly, to disputes between Oldham and the Massachusetts Bay Company. The company got the better of the argument but Oldham did end up with a grant of 500 acres of land within the boundaries of the town of Watertown. He settled there in 1630 and embarked on a career of coastal trading.<br>
<br>By 1636 Oldham had made useful contacts with the Narragansetts, and had received a grant from their leader, Canonicus, of Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay. In July that year he was trading in the area of Block Island and Fisher's Island with &#145;two English boys, and two Indians of Narragansett&#146;  (Bradford, 166) when another coastal trader discovered Oldham's boat, containing his mutilated body. This incident was but one of the many episodes of conflict between the Narragansetts and the Pequots which led up to the Pequot War of 1637.<br>
<br>At the time of Oldham's death he was still considered a member of the Watertown congregation, but had apparently moved his residence, or at least the base of his trading activities, to Hartford, for his will was proved there, and showed &pound;504 9<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. in debts, against &pound;136 66<i>s</i>. 21<i>d</i>. [<i>sic</i>] in assets. In 1644 his stepson William Bridges unsuccessfully petitioned the Massachusetts Bay general court for a grant of land in consideration of Oldham's services to the colony.<br>
