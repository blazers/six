<span class="headword">Halas,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Janos Halasz]</span>  (1912&#150;1995), <span class="occ">film animator</span>, was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 16 April 1912, the son of Gyozo Halasz (also known as Victor Halasz), journalist, and his wife, Bertha. He was educated in Budapest. At the age of eighteen he moved to Paris, where he studied at the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts and contributed freelance drawings to various illustrated magazines. He returned home in 1932 and joined the animation studio formed by George Pal. There he did his first animation, making advertising shorts with paper cut-outs. Pal would later develop the different idea of animated puppets, creating &#145;Puppetoons&#146; at first for Horlicks malted milk advertisements, and eventually moving to Hollywood to produce such award winning features as <span class="italic">Destination Moon</span>, which would blend live action with puppets. Halas left Pal in 1933 to study modern art at The Studio, a private school of graphic design run by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Alexander Bortnyik as a split-off from the famous German group, the Bauhaus. In 1935 he established his own animation studio in Hungary but could not expand beyond making cinema advertisements for cigarettes and alcohol. However, one of his colour cartoons was seen in London, leading to an invitation to come to England to work for British Animated Films, a small company run by photographers Trigg and Denes and financier Weisbach. There, working on the Technicolor cartoon <span class="italic">Music Man</span>, released in 1938 and directed by Henry Elwis, Halas met his future wife, Joy Batchelor, for the first time.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_70085"></a><span class="headword">Joy Ethel Batchelor</span>  (1914&#150;1991), <span class="occ">film animator</span>, was born at 22 Euston Avenue, Watford, Hertfordshire, on 12 May 1914, the daughter of Edward Joseph Batchelor, lithographer, and his wife, Ethel Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Herbert. After a course in art and design at the local art college she began to submit her freelance sketches to the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, where her work pleased the art editor, Donald Zec. She entered animation working for Champion Films, the company of the Australian cartoonist and producer Denis Connolly. The result, <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>, was shown in late 1935 but was not reviewed by the trade or any other press. &#145;There was no paper work&#146;, she recalled, &#145;we drew directly onto the celluloids with ink&#146;  (BECTU tape). In 1936 she saw an advertisement placed in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> by John Halas, &#145;Animators wanted&#146;. She applied and got the job.<br>
<br>The first film that Halas and Batchelor made together, <span class="italic">Music Man</span>, was based on the life of the composer Liszt. &#145;The design was good, the colour was nice, the script terrible!&#146; Batchelor remembered  (BECTU tape). The company went out of business, and Halas and Batchelor went to Hungary together. Prospects were not much better and with war in the offing they returned to England, where Halas drew a few cartoons for the pocket magazine <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>. On 27 April 1940 they married at the register office in Paddington, London.<br>
<br>In 1940, with the wartime shortage of newsprint, the large advertising agency J. Walter Thompson decided to enter the cinema commercial field. Halas and Batchelor joined the film unit, but also formed their own company, Halas and Batchelor, and in 1941 produced <span class="italic">Carnival in the Clothes Cupboard</span> for Lux Soap. They also made their first entertainment short, <span class="italic">Pocket Cartoon</span>. In 1942 the wartime Ministry of Information films division, headed by Jack Beddington, contracted them to make a series of propaganda shorts for cinema release. Produced under the aegis of the documentary makers Realist Films, <span class="italic">Filling the Gap</span>, sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, exhorted cinema-goers to cultivate allotments, while <span class="italic">Dustbin Parade</span> concluded with the then urgent message &#145;Mobilize your scrap!&#146; The little company now supported a staff of animators that included Vera Linnecar, Kathleen Murphy, and Wally Crook, with their original music composed by Ernst Meyer and Matyas Seiber. The first British feature-length cartoon film was made by the team in 1945, the sixty-five-minute <span class="italic">Handling Ships</span>, sponsored by the Admiralty. Using animated drawings and models, this specialized semi-documentary directed by Bob Privett was never seen by the general public. The same applied to their second feature, <span class="italic">Water for Fire Fighting</span> (1949), sponsored by the fire brigade. Their first successful series starring a regular character, Charley (voiced by comedian Harold Berens), was a run of six sponsored by the peacetime equivalent of the old Ministry of Information, the central office of information. The first was <span class="italic">Charley's New Town</span> (1947). Finally in 1949 they broke free from governmental sponsorship with <span class="italic">Heave Away my Johnny</span>, a sing-song short for children's cinema clubs. Advertising films came back with <span class="italic">The Flu-ing Squad</span> (1951) for Aspro tablets.<br>
<br>Halas's personal devotion to modern art at last found its way onto the animated screen when he produced four shorts known as the <span class="roman">Poet and Painter</span> series for the Festival of Britain in 1951. With the combined talents of artists Mervyn Peake and Henry Moore, actors Michael Redgrave and Eric Portman, the series lacked only colour. A year later they made the first British cartoon in three dimensions, Edward Lear's <span class="italic">The Owl and the Pussycat</span>. In 1954 came the first British feature cartoon proper, produced by the American entrepreneur Louis de Rochemont. This was <span class="italic">Animal Farm</span>, from the fantastic novel by George Orwell. Although the styling was truly too Disneyesque for most purists, the film was also a <i>tour de force</i> for actor Maurice Denham, who supplied all the voices.<br>
<br>Halas and Batchelor entered the new world of television with excitement. First came a series with the ungainly name <span class="italic">Habatales</span> (1959), then a series about <span class="roman">Foo-foo</span> (1960), designed without dialogue for the international market. Paper sculpture was employed for the series <span class="italic">Snip and Snap</span> (1961), but easily their finest hour came with <span class="italic">Tales of Hoffnung</span> (1965), a colour series animating the extremely amusing musical cartoons of Gerard Hoffnung, the best of which was <span class="italic">The Hoffnung Symphony Orchestra</span>. In 1966 Batchelor directed the feature-length adaptation of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta <span class="italic">Ruddigore</span>, but frankly without great acclaim. Meanwhile their company had been sold to a television consortium, and although their name appeared on countless television series from <span class="italic">The Lone Ranger</span> to <span class="italic">Popeye</span>, these had nothing to do with either partner. Halas's final feature was made for German television, animating the strip-cartoon pioneer Wilhelm Busch and his famous characters <span class="italic">Max und Moritz</span> (1977).<br>
<br>Continuing to pioneer every advance in animation including computerization, Halas was also the founder and president of the International Animated Film Association and he was appointed OBE in 1972. He was the author of numerous books and articles on animation, including <span class="italic">How to Cartoon</span> (1959), <span class="italic">Computer Animation</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Visual Scripting</span> (1977), and <span class="italic">The Contemporary Animator</span> (1991). Joy Batchelor died at their home, 6 Holford Road, Hampstead, London, on 14 May 1991, after a long illness. John Halas died, also in London, on 20 January 1995. They were survived by their son and daughter.<br>
<br>As animators and later producers of animated cartoon films, Halas and Batchelor held the record for UK production, having overseen some 2000 films in the genre during half a century in partnership. Together they made every kind of animated film, from official shorts during wartime to cinema and television commercials, three-dimensional experiments, &#145;art films&#146;, series for television, and the first British feature-length cartoons. They were sometimes hailed as the British equivalent of America's Walt Disney. Nevertheless it has rightly been said that &#145;they remained curiously European in their styling, design, colouring and humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 25 Jan 1995).<br>
