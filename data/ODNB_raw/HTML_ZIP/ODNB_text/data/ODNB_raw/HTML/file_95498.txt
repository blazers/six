<span class="headword">Hazlitt,  William</span>  (1737&#150;1820), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and author</span>, was born in Shronell, co. Tipperary, on 18 April 1737, the eldest son of John Hazlitt (<i>b</i>. 1710?), a flax factor from Antrim, and his wife, Margaret. His parents were Presbyterians inclining towards rational dissent, and his mother was keen for him to be educated for the ministry. After leaving his local grammar school Hazlitt matriculated at the University of Glasgow in 1756, where he was taught by Adam Smith, then delivering the lectures on which his <span class="italic">Theory of Moral Sentiments</span> would be based. Hazlitt was also taught by Joseph Black and James Watt, and may have been involved in experiments that led to the discovery of latent heat, which had begun by 1757.<br>
<br>By the time he graduated MA in 1761 Hazlitt had formed the views to which he remained true for the rest of his life. He was essentially a Socinian, and in later years would associate himself with the doctrines of Priestleyan Unitarians; though Priestley was an Arian until influenced by Nathaniel Lardner, and did not adopt Socinian opinions until about 1769. He was thus anticipated by Hazlitt.<br>
<br>Hazlitt's first post was that of chaplain to Sir Conyers Joscelyn and his family at Hyde Hall, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, from where as a frequent visitor to the London theatres he became an admirer of Kitty Clive and Hannah Pritchard. In 1764 he became the minister of the Presbyterian meeting house in Wisbech, a post held until 1758 by John Godwin, father of the philosopher and novelist William Godwin. Towards the end of his two years there he met Grace Loftus (1746&#150;1837), daughter of Thomas Loftus, ironmonger, and married her in Peterborough on 19 January 1766. Shortly after they moved to Marshfield in Gloucestershire where Hazlitt became the minister of the Presbyterian meeting house. Later that year he published his <span class="italic">Sermon on Human Mortality</span> (1766), beginning his association with Joseph Johnson, the bookseller who would publish his British writings until the end of his authorial career in 1808. In 1767 Grace gave birth to a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98526/', "John Hazlitt")</script>, who became a portrait painter.<br>
<br>In June 1770 the Hazlitts, now with two sons, John and Loftus, moved to Maidstone in Kent. By this time Priestley was editing the <span class="italic">Theological Repository</span> and Hazlitt contributed to it under the pen-names Philalethes and Rationalis. Thanks partly to his contact with Priestley, Hazlitt became absorbed into Unitarian circles. He may have associated with the Club of Honest Whigs (many of whom he knew), who during the 1770s met regularly at the London Coffee House on Ludgate Hill, as well as with such wealthy Unitarians as the wheelwright Thomas Viny, at whose house in Tenterden he encountered Benjamin Franklin during the latter's second English agency. Other prominent dissenters who befriended him at this period included Richard Price, Caleb Fleming, Andrew Kippis, Theophilus Lindsey, John Palmer, Thomas Amory, Abraham Rees, and the businessman Samuel Vaughan. Also during the Maidstone years Grace gave birth to a daughter, Margaret (1770&#150;1841), and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12805/', "William Hazlitt (1778&#150;1830)")</script>, the future essayist.<br>
<br>A schism within the Maidstone congregation prompted Hazlitt to move his family to Bandon on the south-west coast of Ireland in March 1780. There he wrote newspaper articles attacking British officers who were running their swords into the hammocks of injured or ailing American prisoners of war, thereby killing or maiming them. Threats of &#145;assassination&#146; led him to appeal (through Richard Price) in 1782 to the prime minister, William Petty, second earl of Shelburne, who replaced the regiment concerned with another, which for the remainder of Hazlitt's time in Bandon took better care of its captives.<br>
<br>When the war with America ended, the Hazlitts were on the first boat to New York, the <i>Henry</i>, which sailed from Cork on 3 April 1783. Hazlitt hoped to find a post as a Unitarian minister in Philadelphia, but was unable to overcome the bigotry of hardline Presbyterians in the city. Efforts were made to establish him first as a schoolmaster in the nearby village of Germantown and then as principal of the newly founded Dickinson College, but without success. In Philadelphia he probably attended meetings of the American Philosophical Society, founded by Franklin in 1743. In 1784 he published, as editor, Priestley's <span class="italic">Appeal to the Serious and Candid Professor of Christianity</span> (first printed in Leeds in 1770) with a local bookseller, Robert Bell.<br>
<br>In May 1784 he moved his family to Boston on the promise of a job as minister replacing Samuel Cooper, the recently deceased pastor of the Brattle Street church, but enemies from Philadelphia thwarted the appointment. However, he quickly made friends with the liberal clergymen who formed the Boston Association of Ministers, which included Charles Chauncy, John Eliot, John Lathrop, and James Freeman. Freeman, minister to King's Chapel in Boston, was urged by Hazlitt to revise his liturgy so as to delete references to the Trinity&#151;which he did in June 1785. And it was thanks to Hazlitt's encouragement that King's Chapel detached itself from the Episcopalian church to become America's first Unitarian church in November 1787. In the meantime Hazlitt sought postings in New England and Maine, while attacking the Episcopalian establishment, which was still waging a political vendetta against him, first in the <span class="italic">Boston Magazine</span> and then in the <span class="italic">American Herald</span>.<br>
<br>Despite making many friends (including the future president of the United States of America John Adams) Hazlitt was ahead of his time in his religious views and failed to find sufficient support to establish himself in a salaried position. In late 1786 he returned to England, his wife and children following in August 1787. None the less, his work in America did bear fruit. The founding of the first Unitarian church in America, King's Chapel, would have taken much longer (and might not have happened at all) had it not been for his support, both in word and action&#151;nor would William Bentley, pastor of the East Church, Salem, have adopted Priestley's catechism as a substitute for the Westminster catechism, or made a spirited attack on the doctrine of the Trinity in a course of sermons delivered in 1787. Moreover, it may be more than pure coincidence that Charles Chauncy decided to publish his treatise on universal salvation, <span class="italic">The Mystery Hid from Ages, or the Salvation of All Men</span>, shortly after his first encounter with Hazlitt in 1784. When Priestley landed in America in 1794 he found less resistance to his views than he would otherwise have done, thanks to Hazlitt's labours&#151;which included publication of one of Priestley's own works.<br>
<br>In November 1787 Hazlitt settled his family in Wem, a small market town in Shropshire, where he ministered to the dissenting meeting house. He also took charge of the local school and devoted his energies to the education of his son William. One of the highlights of his intellectual life was his meeting with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, brought home by William after a sermon at Shrewsbury in January 1798&#151;an encounter described in his son's &#145;My first acquaintance with poets&#146;.<br>
<br>Hazlitt was an indefatigable writer. In addition to the eight articles he published in the <span class="italic">Theological Repository</span> between 1770 and 1788, and the eleven so far attributed to him in the <span class="italic">Boston Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">American Herald</span> between September 1784 and April 1785, he contributed twenty-one articles to the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> from June 1806 to September 1818, usually over his own initials, though on one occasion as Philalethes, and on another as &#145;An Old Unitarian&#146;. In June 1806 the <span class="italic">Repository</span> advertised for subscriptions to Hazlitt's <span class="italic">Fifty-Two Sermons</span> in two volumes, which in 1808 was issued by Joseph Johnson as <span class="italic">Sermons for the Use of Families</span>.<br>
<br>Upon retirement in 1813 he lived in Addlestone, Surrey, before moving to Bath in 1817. Shortly afterwards he and his wife took into their household Catherine Emmet (<i>d</i>. 1824), daughter of Christopher Temple Emmet (<i>c</i>.1761&#150;1788), eldest brother of the United Irishman Robert Emmet, executed in 1803 for his part in the Dublin uprising in July of that year. He spent the last two years of his life at Crediton in Devon, dependent on a grant from the Presbyterian Fund and donations from members of his congregation at Wem. The Hazlitts lived first at an old house called Winswood, and later moved to one closer to the church that was traditionally thought to have been part of the old episcopal palace. There are stories of him in his last years being nearly dragged into the water by a swan, of his love of snuff and barley sugar, and of his keeping both in the same leather-lined waistcoat pocket. He died at Crediton on 16 July 1820 at the age of eighty-three, and was buried in the parish churchyard there. His wife survived him. When on 6 August his death was reported in Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">Examiner</span>, for which his son frequently wrote, he was described as &#145;through his whole life a friend to truth and liberty&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, 12/659, 6 Aug 1820, 512).<br>
