</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharp,  James</span>  (1618&#150;1679), <span class="occ">archbishop of St Andrews</span>, was born at Banff Castle on 4 May 1618, one of three sons of William Sharp (<i>d</i>. 1638), sheriff clerk of Banff (1617), and Isobel Lesley, daughter of the laird of Kinninvy.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Sharp's father was a servant of the earl of Buchan, and beneficiary of the patronage of the earl of Findlater, whom he had served earlier; he was also elder in the Banff parish. <span class="italic">A True and Impartial Account of the Life of &hellip; Sharp</span> (1723) gives William a pedigree among the landed classes: his father was an Aberdeen merchant born to a &#145;gentleman in Perthshire&#146;; his maternal grandmother belonged to a lairdly family from Forfarshire. James went to the new (1620) grammar school in Banff. In 1633 he entered King's College, Aberdeen, where he studied under John Forbes of Corse, professor of theology at the college. There he imbibed its tradition of ecclesiastical moderation, upheld by the Aberdeen doctors, who were Augustinians in theology, shared a wide commitment to patristic learning, and were willing to embrace ceremony in worship, a moderate episcopacy generally without notions of the <i>jus divinum</i> in polity, and royal supremacy over the church.<br>
<br>In 1638&#151;perhaps following the introduction in February of the national covenant&#151;Sharp journeyed to England, intending to obtain preferment in the English church. He visited both universities, but there is no evidence that he did in fact find a position in England, and early in 1642 he was a regent at St Andrews University. Clearly he had by then set aside possible scruples and subscribed the national covenant; it may have been with the help of Alexander Henderson, the clerical leader of the covenanting movement, and also John Leslie, seventh earl of Rothes, an aristocratic insider in the movement and Sharp's kinsman on his mother's side, that he obtained this position. The <span class="italic">Life of Mr James Sharp</span> (1719) states that while at St Andrews, Sharp fathered and murdered an illegitimate child, but the allegation is entirely lacking in credibility; more credence may be given to a story which has him involved in a fight at the table with another regent, John Sinclair. In 1648 the earl of Crawford presented Sharp to the parish of Crail, a royal burgh in Fife, and within the presbytery of St Andrews.<br>
<br>Sharp was appointed a synod delegate from the presbytery, then a member of a search committee for faculty at St Andrews. In 1649, and again in 1650, he was sought as pastor for Edinburgh. On the second occasion the general assembly permitted his transfer, but Cromwell's intervention in the country meant that nothing came of the project. In April 1653 Sharp married Helen Moncrieff, daughter of the laird of Randerston. They had seven children: Sir William, who succeeded his father in the barony of Scotscraig; John; Isabella, who married John Cunningham of Barns; Catherine; Margaret, who married William, Lord Saltoun; and another daughter who married Erskine of Cambo.<h2>
<a name="Mediatorinthe1650s"></a>Mediator in the 1650s</h2>Sharp's career in the 1650s was defined by the rupture of the kirk between the radical protesters or remonstrants and the resolutioners, the more moderate group with which Sharp identified. He was elected a member of the commission of the general assembly in 1650, and first attended its sessions on 13 September 1650, ten days after Oliver Cromwell defeated the Scottish army at Dunbar. There he began his work of mediation between the two parties, seeking to avoid a lasting split, although this occurred in July 1651. Following the disaster at Worcester in August 1651 Sharp and others were detained by Cromwell and he spent nearly a year in London, though in April 1652 he was bailed from the Tower, perhaps because he was then only a minor player. He returned to his parish by August, and in January 1653 was a resolutioner representative to a unity conference. In October 1654 he was moderator of the provincial synod which declared itself against Gillespie's charter, a compromise with Cromwellian governance of the church. Still, Sharp showed himself a willing negotiator, trying always to avoid breakdowns in communication and rigid positions; thus he was willing to bargain away public prayers for the king in exchange for various freedoms.<br>
<br>When the protesters prepared to send a delegation to London to advance their own cause the resolutioners countered with Sharp, who went south late in 1656 in the company of Lord Broghill; it was during this trip that he saw a resolutioner apology through the press, <span class="italic">A true representation of the rise, progress, and state of the present division in the Church of Scotland</span>. Sharp built support among the local church leaders in London and succeeded in blocking the protesters' plans before returning to Scotland towards the end of 1657. In February 1659 he returned to London to treat with Richard Cromwell, but the army's intervention leading to Cromwell's abdication left Sharp exposed as a royalist and he was interrogated before the council. He was ordered to return to Scotland on 29 June, having achieved but little. In December he wrote an explanatory document for General George Monck, who was about to enter England to effect the restoration of the house of Stewart. The &#145;Declaration of his intentions in marching into England with his army&#146; denounced usurpation by the current English regime and identified the army's goal as &#145;the recovery of the just liberties and freedoms of the people&#146;  (Buckroyd, 45). Sharp returned to his diplomatic duties in London in February 1660. During this time the resolutioner party finally achieved ascendancy over the protesters, and Sharp attempted to defend the loyalty of the resolutioners and make them acceptable to the king. He sailed for Breda on 4 May and returned to England with the court, arriving on 25 May. He was under pressure from Scotland to remind the king of the covenant, but this notion of the direction of events was far from reality, though the king did utter affectionate words about Scotland and promised to call a general assembly of the church. Sharp arrived in Scotland on 31 August 1660. Thereafter he wrote of his confident expectation of a presbyterian future at least for Scotland, though it is also clear that already some were beginning to suspect that he was conspiring to effect a change, which he vigorously denied&#151;&#145;I am a Scot and a Presbyter&#146;  (Airy, 1.52)&#151;and ridiculed alleged ambition in the light of the reception one might hope for as a bishop in Scotland. He did, however, make clear his belief that the church must be so ordered as to remove any conflicts with &#145;the king's interest&#146;, but the king had smiled at this and told Sharp that &#145;you will be counted a malignant when you come home&#146;  (ibid., 1.48).<h2>
<a name="Converttoepiscopalianism"></a>Convert to episcopalianism</h2>Sharp was under pressure to leave Crail for Edinburgh, but in fact on 16 January 1661 he moved back to St Andrews, becoming third master at St Mary's College and professor of divinity&#151;much against Samuel Rutherford's wishes. He also assumed duties as king's chaplain in Scotland. Sharp's confidence in the presbyterian future of Scotland was soon eclipsed by the actions of the Scottish parliament. The <span class="roman">Act Rescissory</span> and the <span class="roman">Act Concerning Religion and Church Government</span> on 28 March did not end presbytery, but the language was ambiguous and imposed the royal supremacy in the determination of church polity. The drift of events cast Sharp's actions and his policy of moderation in a bad light&#151;Robert Baillie expressed a mild concern in a letter to the earl of Lauderdale on 18 April.<br>
<br>In late April Sharp departed for London again to negotiate about, but not for, the church, in that his appointment was from the parliamentary commissioner, John Middleton, first earl of Middleton, and not the church. He was willing to give up certain elements of presbytery, permitting the institution of constant moderators in the presbyteries; he hoped thereby to avoid worse infringements. The episcopal party, led by Middleton, was in power, and it was clear that without the establishment of episcopacy Scotland would remain an occupied country. Sharp was confronted with a choice, whereby he could hold to his presbyterianism and lose all, &#145;or he could resign himself to the inevitable, go along with the change and try to ensure that it conformed at least to some extent with the desires of Scots churchmen&#146;  (Buckroyd, 71). Given both his personality and his moderate opinions on church government, he submitted to the inevitable. On 6 August Alexander Brodie of Brodie recorded in his diary that in London he had met Sharp, who related &#145;what conflicts he had heir to hold out unworthi men from being Bishops&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Laing, 201) and to withstand the attempts of English bishops to force their own choices on Scotland. On 6 September a proclamation concerning episcopacy was read in Edinburgh, and Sharp, now back in Scotland, became an agent for the new scheme; Baillie said he was poisoned by Gilbert Sheldon, then bishop of London, and George Morley, bishop of Winchester, and sought to recruit resolutioners to serve as bishops, an attempt which miscarried entirely. He returned to London on 15 October. On 14 November he was nominated to the archiepiscopal see of St Andrews, and on 15 December was consecrated in Westminster Abbey by Sheldon and Morley, using the prayer book, &#145;but without prejudice to the privileges of the Church of Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 171). With him three others were also consecrated: Andrew Fairfoul for Glasgow, Robert Leighton for Dunblane, and James Hamilton for Galloway. Sharp and Leighton were compelled to re-enter orders as deacons then as priests since their presbyterian ordinations were invalidated, though Sharp initially opposed this demand. Such a policy was not, however, generally pursued back in Scotland with regard to the parochial clergy.<h2>
<a name="Archbishop"></a>Archbishop</h2>Archbishop Sharp returned, in the splendour of a new coach bought in London, complete with &#145;two lakqueys in purple&#146;, to Edinburgh on 8 April 1662, with Fairfoul and Hamilton, while Leighton boycotted the pomp and ceremony. On the 15th and 16th he journeyed through Fife to his see, and on the 17th he preached on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 2: 2, in which he justified his actions, claiming &#145;that he was ever in his judgment for Episcopacy and the ceremonies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Robert Blair</span>, 405). On 7 May he participated in the consecration, performed with great ceremony and using the prayer book, of another six bishops in Edinburgh, and on 8 May the bishops returned to parliament as the traditional ecclesiastical estate. On 17 May parliament passed an act restoring episcopal government. With two more consecrations in St Andrews on 3 June the Scottish episcopate had been resuscitated. Beginning in late September the government began its harassment of nonconforming ministers, and Sharp evinced concern about the direction of policy. But by now he had allied himself with the government and against the presbyterians, and already his policy of moderation leading to unity was under strain. He again visited London in early 1663, and upon his return in June he and Fairfoul were brought into the privy council, where his accession to more rigorous action became apparent, as in the instance of Andrew Donaldson, minister of Dalgetty, whom he forced out against the wishes of the earl of Dunfermline, lord privy seal. Another trip &#151; of which a detailed financial account survives in the archbishop's household book  (pp. 37&#150;59)&#151;to London in December lasted until February 1664, and his achievement this time was the church commission which assumed the privy council's work in combating nonconformity. In 1664 he went to London to lobby for appointment to the chancellor's post. This attempt failed, but until 1666 Sharp and his old ally, John Leslie, earl of Rothes, were supreme in Scotland. However, the Scottish political nation grew discontent with Sharp's apparent usurpation of the political power it coveted&#151;Sir John Lauder of Fountainhall stated that John Cunningham, earl of Glencairn, and even Rothes, as chancellors, would never grant Sharp the precedency he was supposed to receive&#151;and by late 1666 his rising star began to pale. The Pentland rising in November was suppressed and a defeat inflicted on the rebels at Rullion Green on 28 November. His efficient direction of the suppression became the pretext for his disgrace, and from 1 February 1667 until 4 July he was absent from the privy council; he came close to losing his position, and for some months attended only to diocesan duties.<br>
<br>Sharp was now clearly subordinated to the regime headed by John Maitland, earl of Lauderdale, so that his vision for an independent church governed by a moderate episcopacy was in ruins, the archbishop was regarded with suspicion by the landed classes and government, and he was alienated from a vocal part of the church. The extremity of the situation was manifested when James Mitchell made an attempt on his life on 11 July 1668, in Edinburgh. Sharp was uninjured, but Andrew Honeyman, bishop of Orkney, was wounded in the arm. Burnet claimed that &#145;Sharp was so universally hated, that, tho' this was done in the full day light, and on the high street, yet no body offered to seize the assassin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>). This episode notwithstanding, the policy of repression which Sharp had come to advocate was now superseded by Bishop Robert Leighton's accommodation, supported by the Lauderdale administration; Sharp's co-operation was secured while he visited London in the months August to November. Leighton's episcopal policies trod lightly on the unwilling, giving more power to the rank and file of clergy in synods, recalling Bishop William Cowper's programme of bishop-in-presbytery during the Jacobean era. On 7 June 1669 was issued the first indulgence, whereby forty-two presbyterians were allowed back to their parishes under restrictions, but without any demand for acceptance of episcopacy. Sharp disliked the reversal but was powerless to stop it. His colleague in the see of Glasgow, Alexander Burnet, also ran afoul of the political class and in late 1669 was forced to resign. On 16 November parliament passed the <span class="roman">Act of Supremacy</span>&#151;much against Sharp's judgement&#151;whereby the king gained &#145;Supream Authority and Supremacie over all persons and in all causes ecclesiasticall within this kingdom&#146;  (Dickinson, Croft, and Donaldson, 3.160). Sharp therefore had no choice but to participate in Leighton's transfer to Glasgow, which took place, against Leighton's first wishes, in April 1670.<h2>
<a name="Eclipse"></a>Eclipse</h2>In fact Sharp was very nearly a cipher in these years&#151;he was not even consulted about the vacant see of Edinburgh, and the 1672 indulgence went ahead without his concurrence. But another change came when the accommodation scheme failed to bring in the determined radical presbyterians. In spring 1674 the synod of Fife expressed its discontent with the confusion aroused by the radicals and Sharp took the message to Lauderdale. The church was now on the verge of schism between hardline episcopalians and moderates who supported Leighton, whose resignation was ultimately accepted in August 1674. Now a political struggle broke out pitting Lauderdale against William Douglas-Hamilton, duke of Hamilton, and this encouraged a reconciliation between Sharp and Lauderdale. If he was subjected to public intimidation in Edinburgh in June 1674, his political position was bolstered by the restoration of Burnet to the see of Glasgow in September 1674, while an episcopal opponent, James Ramsey of Dunblane, was suspended. Sharp was in London from August 1674 to August 1675, and when he returned he was once again the master of the church and went ahead with a strident programme against nonconformity, including the Highland Host. In his final years his moral stature was much diminished by his defence of the dubious judicial proceedings against the presbyterian James Kirkton and then his role in the sordid affair which led to the execution of James Mitchell, who had attempted to assassinate him in 1668. Sharp perjured himself in order to disoblige the government of promises of leniency. He was now a hostage to the fortune of the sometimes beleaguered Lauderdale. There were also rumours to the effect that the archbishop and his wife were at odds with each other, &#145;objecting, adulteri and incest the one, and witchcraft the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Laing, 350). While almost certainly false, these allegations hint at the archbishop's reputation among his foes.<br>
<br>The end came quickly on 3 May 1679. A band of nine conventiclers in Fife, two lairds, a weaver, and six tenant farmers, had plotted mischief against the local sheriff depute, but when they heard that Sharp was driving home to St Andrews they changed their target and chased down the carriage on Magus Moor near St Andrews; they shot and stabbed the archbishop to death before his daughter Isabella's eyes. A somewhat muddled investigation followed, leading to the executions of David Hackstone of Rathillet and Andrew Guillan, a weaver. William Dingwall perished at Drumclog a month after the murder; the other six escaped. Sharp's funeral was conducted at Holy Trinity Church, St Andrews, on 17 May. Among the bequests made from his estate was a gift of 1000 marks to aid the poor of Banff  (Foster, 63).<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>The presbyterian tradition has been merciless to Sharp. Before his &#145;treachery&#146;, Robert Baillie had written: &#145;You were the most wise, honest, diligent, and successfull agent of the nation in the late dangers of our Church in Cromwell's tyme. &hellip; Since first acquaintance yow have ever been very faithfull and loving to myself in all occasions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.473). After his consecration he was regarded as a traitor. One contemporary poem was entitled &#145;Misanthr&#333;pos, Judas, Scoto-Brittanus his Lyfe, Lamentatione and Legacie&#146;. The seventieth stanza has Sharp confess:<blockquote>
<div>My master Judas was more stout<br>
</div>
<div>Then I his schollar faint<br>
</div>
<div>and the more honest was in that<br>
</div>
<div>he shooner did recant.<br>
</div> (NL Scot., Wodrow MSS, Octavo xxix, no. 11, 113<i>r</i>&#150;128<i>v</i>; stanza 70, pt 1, 119<i>v</i>)</blockquote>James Kirkton, who had reason to hold a grudge, wrote that Sharp's<blockquote>great gift was his prudence, dissimulation, and industry, which qualified him well for his terrible undertakings. He was by all that knew him taken to be no better than a state atheist; he used no private prayers, and once in a month served his family: yea, he was known to be a man of flagitious life, and not only a debauched pailliard, but a cruel murtherer. (Kirkton, 83)</blockquote>His modern biographer believes that Sharp's interpreters have commonly &#145;ante-dated his corruption&#146;  (Buckroyd, 118), but even if one is generous in dating the fall, Sharp's final years left ample opportunity for him to stain his historical record, beyond the mere fact of a realist inclined to make strategic retreats by clutching to position, if not power, at all costs. As happened over the previous century, the episcopate all too frequently was episcopalianism's worst enemy.<br>
