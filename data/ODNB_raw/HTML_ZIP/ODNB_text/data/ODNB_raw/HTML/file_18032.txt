<span class="headword">March <span class="st"> [ de Marchia]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1302), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, is consistently described in records as &#145;magister&#146;, and is assumed to have been a graduate of Oxford University. First recorded as rector of Thorpe in Nottinghamshire in 1277, he entered the king's service and was employed in the wardrobe, where he was cofferer (1280&#150;84) and controller (15 August 1283 to 1 May 1290), and in the latter capacity had temporary charge of the great seal in February 1290. He was treasurer of the exchequer, in succession to John Kirkby, from 6 April 1290 until his dismissal on 16 August 1295. As treasurer he presided over important reforms in the administration of taxation. Henceforward the exchequer controlled the receipt, auditing, and expenditure of lay subsidies, and the financial independence of the wardrobe was considerably reduced. The king's personal confidence in him was clearly displayed on 13 October 1289, when Edward I appointed him to a prestigious commission of seven trusted men, headed by the bishops of Winchester and Bath and Wells, to hear grievances against the king's ministers over wrongs committed by them during the king's recent absence abroad. Nevertheless March became the only great officer of state who fell permanently from office for political reasons in Edward I's reign. He was dismissed by the king in 1295 in a blaze of unpopularity.<br>
<br>March's involvement in Edward I's financial extortions, particularly the scrutiny of money on 4 July 1294, which gave royal agents access to wealth stored in religious institutions, brought him notoriety among churchmen. <span class="italic">Flores historiorum</span> claimed that he should be called &#145;not bishop of Bath but tyrant&#146;, and that he was &#145;not protecting the church but attacking it&#146;  (3.274). Edward I was willing to make his treasurer a scapegoat. The scrutiny may have been an important cause of March's dismissal, but another contributory factor was his extraordinary unpopularity in London, arising from his tight grip on civic administration as treasurer while the city was in the king's hand between 1285 and 1298. A roll of two membranes containing unanswered petitions from London citizens to the king and council against March, internally datable to August or September 1295, survives to bear witness to the city's hatred. The Dunstable annals suggest he tried to buy his way out of trouble with a large sum of money. But the Osney annals give a more favourable picture of him at the time of his appointment to the treasury, as a man of foresight, discretion, and circumspection.<br>
<br>March amassed a number of benefices during his career. In 1291 a papal dispensation, at the king's request, to the treasurer March (specifically described therein as subdeacon) listed eight churches in four dioceses, which, in addition to the deanery of St Martin's-le-Grand, he had held without papal dispensation and without being ordained priest within a year of receiving them. He resigned the rectory of Thorpe, and was prepared to resign two more, but sought permission to retain the rest, together with canonries in Salisbury, Chichester, and Wells, and a portion in the chapel of St Clement, Pontefract, and also to accept another or other rectories on resigning one or more of these. On 28 January 1293 he was elected bishop of Bath and Wells, the royal assent was signified on 1 March, temporalities were restored on 19 March, and consecration took place at Canterbury on 17 May, being performed by the bishops of London, Rochester, Ely, and Dublin in the vacancy following the death of Archbishop Pecham.<br>
<br>The precise date of March's death, long cited as 11 June 1302, is now uncertain, but he was buried at Wells on 17 June, and administration of his will was granted on 3 July 1302. A Somerset inquisition recorded ignorance of his heir, but the award of a papal nuncio in a subsequent dispute, in 1313, names two close kin: March left 100 marks to pay his brother, John March, if still living, or his nephew, Robert Urry, to go to the Holy Land for him at the first subsequent crusade. His executors had deposited this money in September 1311 with the dean and chapter of Wells, to be paid at the first expedition; there was no crusade and the money attracted borrowers and claimants for over thirty years.<br>
<br>In June 1324 the dean and chapter of Wells advised their proctors at the papal court of their decision to urge Bishop March's canonization, and began their campaign. The archbishop of Canterbury and eight English bishops wrote to Pope John XXII (<i>r</i>. 1316&#150;34) on 4 December 1325 pressing the case. Edward II and later Edward III lent support to the request, and the diocesan clergy granted a tenth to finance costs. The attribution of healing miracles gives an impression of sanctity beyond the more general claims to moral probity and generous alms-giving, but it is possible that part at least of March's popularity in his own diocese arose from his financial prowess. On 19 January 1295 March had entered a bond to repay on demand &pound;1000 advanced to him and the prior and convent of Bath and dean and chapter of Wells by the bishops of Lincoln and Winchester (agents of the papacy for the crusading tenths granted to Edward I in 1291); the bond stated that the sum had been spent by March on his own and the bishopric's business and indemnified the prior and dean and their chapters. The chapter house at Wells is ascribed to his time as bishop, and is architecturally of the period.<br>
