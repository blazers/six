<span class="headword">Fahie, Sir  William Charles</span>  (1763&#150;1833), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, came from an Irish family settled at St Kitts, West Indies, where his father was judge of the vice-admiralty court. He entered the navy in 1777, on board the <i>Seaford</i>, with Captain Colpoys, and was afterwards in the <i>Royal George</i>. In October 1779 he was appointed to the <i>Sandwich</i>, bearing the flag of Sir George Rodney, and was present at the defeat of Langara off Cape St Vincent, and in the several actions with De Guichen on 17 April and 15 and 19 May 1780. In August 1780 he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Russell</i>, in which he was present in the action off Martinique on 28 April 1781, and at St Kitts on 26 January 1782. On account of his local knowledge he was afterwards sent by Hood to communicate with the garrison of Brimstone Hill, and on the second occasion, being unable to regain his ship, he gave himself up to the French general, but was permitted to depart. He rejoined the <i>Russell</i> at St Lucia, and was present in the actions to leeward of Dominica on 9 and 12 April.<br>
<br>In January 1783 Fahie was confirmed in the rank of lieutenant, but he remained with his family at St Kitts until the outbreak of the war with France in 1793, when he was appointed to the sloop <i>Zebra</i>, Captain Robert Faulknor, in which he took part in the brilliant assault on Fort Royal. Sir John Jervis consequently appointed him to the flagship, the <i>Boyne</i>, and on 5 August 1793 promoted him to be commander of the <i>Woolwich</i>. On 2 February 1796 he was posted to command the <i>Perdrix</i> (22 guns), in which he continued until she was paid off in August 1799. In 1804 Fahie was again sent out to the West Indies, in command of the <i>Hyaena</i>, from which in 1805 he was moved into the frigate <i>Amelia</i>, and again in 1806 into the <i>Ethalion</i>, in which he assisted at the capture of the Danish West Indian islands by Sir Alexander Cochrane in December 1807. In November 1808 he was appointed to the <i>Belle Isle</i> (74 guns), one of the squadron that captured Martinique in February 1809. He afterwards exchanged with Commodore Cockburn into the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i>, another line-of-battle ship, employed in April 1809 in the blockade of three French ships which had anchored in the roadstead of the Saintes. On the night of 14 April they put to sea, closely followed by the sloops <i>Hazard</i> and <i>Recruit</i> and the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i>, the rest of the squadron being at a considerable distance. The chase continued during the following day. At nightfall the French ships separated; the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> and the sloops attached themselves to the <i>Hautpoult</i>, and, mainly through the persistent gallantry of Captain Charles Napier of the <i>Recruit</i>, assisted towards the close by the frigate <i>Castor</i>, brought her to action about four o'clock on the morning of the 17th, and captured her after a sharp combat lasting an hour and a half. The following August Fahie was appointed to the <i>Hautpoult</i>, which had been commissioned as the <i>Abercromby</i>; in November he was ordered to wear a broad pennant, and in February 1810 assisted in the capture of Guadeloupe, from which he was sent by Cochrane to take possession of St Martin's and St Eustatius. In June he sailed for England in charge of a valuable convoy, and after the <i>Abercromby</i> had been refitted, in December he joined the flag of Sir George Berkeley at Lisbon. During the three following years he commanded the <i>Abercromby</i> in the channel and the Bay of Biscay, and in 1815 was appointed to the <i>Malta</i>, which, on the escape of Napoleon from Elba, was sent out to the Mediterranean, where Fahie was employed for some months as senior officer on the coast of Italy, for which the king of the Two Sicilies nominated him a commander of the order of St Ferdinand and Merit. In 1815 he was made a CB.<br>
<br>Fahie attained flag rank on 12 August 1819, and in January 1820 was appointed commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station, from which in the following year he was sent to Halifax. With the close of his command, in September 1824, his active career terminated. In October he was nominated a KCB, and on 22 July 1830 he became a vice-admiral. In his intervals of half pay, and on his retirement, he lived almost entirely in the West Indies. He was twice married: first, to Elizabeth Renie Heyliger, daughter of Mr William Heyliger of St Eustatius; and second, to Mary Esther Harvey, daughter of the Hon. Augustus William Harvey, member of council of Bermuda. He died at Bermuda on 11 January 1833. Fahie was an officer with an unusually local career; his ideas on discipline were firm, and his promotions secured by merit.<br>
