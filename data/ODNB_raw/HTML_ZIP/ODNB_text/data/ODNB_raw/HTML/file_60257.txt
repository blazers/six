<span class="headword">Gough <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Miller, Aberle]</span>,  (Eleanor) Kathleen</span>  (1925&#150;1990), <span class="occ">social anthropologist and feminist</span>, was born on 16 August 1925 at Hunsingore, near Wetherby, Yorkshire, daughter and youngest child of Albert Gough (1888&#150;1970) and his second wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Umpleby (1892&#150;1965), a devout Methodist who sang and recited in local chapels. Her father became village blacksmith in 1914 and played a major role in introducing combines to west Yorkshire after the Second World War. Her brother, Clifford Arthur (<i>b</i>. 1920) subsequently joined the business; she also had an older half-sister, Laura Margery Howe (1915&#150;1998).<br>
<br>Kathleen Gough attended the church school in Hunsingore (population 100, no piped water, no electricity). She gained scholarships to King James's Grammar School, Knaresborough, and in 1943 to Girton College, Cambridge, where she gained a 2.1 in English (1945) and a first in archaeology and anthropology (1946). She was awarded the Barrington prize, became Girton research scholar for 1946&#150;7, and held two university-awarded social anthropology studentships. On 5 July 1947 she married her fellow student Eric John Miller in St John the Baptist Church, Hunsingore, and they did fieldwork together in Kerala, south India. She was supervised by Professor J. H. Hutton, an old-style anthropologist, and after he retired, by Meyer Fortes. With Evans-Pritchard and Gluckman he introduced her to twentieth-century British social anthropology. Both Eric and Kathleen obtained doctorates, but the strains of fieldwork ended their marriage and they divorced with minimal bitterness in 1950.<br>
<br>Gough, as she was now again called, had abandoned Christianity and declared herself socialist and anti-imperialist as a student of eighteen, but she later said that she found peace in church services and that her socialism arose from the deep sense of moral justice gained from her mother and school. Having returned alone to India in 1951 to continue her work there, she compared the extreme patriarchy of Tamil Brahmans with the &#145;more free-wheeling [polyandrous and matrilineal] Nayars&#146;. She sought to make the villagers historically intelligible and meticulously collected information on contemporary social change. Ahead of her time, she backed observation and insights from psychology with modern quantitative methods. She situated the local, political and present within national and international frameworks, in political economy and in the historical past and, unusually, in the desirable future. Her identification with oppressed landless villagers and her perceptions of Congress Party corruption led her to support Indian communists. Her doctoral thesis was long, but she published immediately only two short papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</span>, one of which was the Curl bequest prize essay in 1953. She spent a year at Harvard (with a Wenner-Gren fellowship), and on Audrey Richards's recommendation David Schneider invited her to help them to produce their massive <span class="italic">Matrilineal Kinship</span> (1961), of which she wrote more than half. It remains an indispensable introduction to the subject, even though some reviewers disliked the editors' controversial comparative and historical materialist approach. Gough's Nayar chapter breaks new ground in the understanding of the past and possible future of matriliny and polyandry. She lectured in Gluckman's department at Manchester in 1954&#150;5 and 1960.<br>
<br>Gough married David Friend Aberle (<i>b</i>. 1918), whom she had met at Harvard, at Manchester All Saints registrar's office on 5 September 1955. An esteemed American anthropologist, he shared the rest of her life as comrade-in-arms, companion, and constructive critic. They had one son, Stephen (<i>b</i>. 1956). After Manchester there followed a series of short but sometimes prestigious university appointments held by Kathleen or David at Stanford, Berkeley, Wayne State, Michigan, and again at Manchester. While David was working at Wayne State University in Detroit, Kathleen began to work with the group running the newspaper <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, including Grace Lee, James Boggs, and C. L. R. James, the Caribbean Marxist historian, revolutionary, and cricket authority. She became both politically sophisticated and a self-styled &#145;agitator&#146;, a term she proudly traced back to Cromwell's army. While back in Manchester in 1960, she quietly informed colleagues on her return from an anti-Polaris demonstration at Holy Loch that she had been arrested, held overnight, and released with a caution.<br>
<br>In 1961 David and Kathleen planned to settle at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, where they were both appointed to tenured posts. As a result of their involvement in anti-nuclear protest, their support for Cuba, and exaggerated accounts of her criticism of J. F. Kennedy to students, complicated by the fact that David was her head of department, they were both forced to resign in 1963. They moved to the University of Oregon, where they played a major part in organizing protests and sit-ins against the Vietnam war. David's actual (and Kathleen's intended) refusal to grade papers that would have caused students to be drafted into the army forced his resignation four years later. They went next to Vancouver, where David took Canadian citizenship. He remained at the University of British Columbia until his retirement in 1984. Kathleen, who retained her UK nationality, joined Simon Fraser University at Burnaby, British Columbia, where her participation in an attempt to democratize the department and the university led to her being manoeuvred out. This led to a worldwide boycott of the university in 1971. In the same year she published a celebrated article on Engels's <span class="italic">The Origin of the Family</span> in the <span class="italic">Journal of Marriage and the Family</span>. She obtained grants enabling her to continue her work on India and, additionally, south-east Asia. She published two books on imperialism in south-east Asia and Vietnam (1973, 1978) and, after work in British libraries (1974) and fieldwork in India (1976), two major books on south-east India (1981, 1989). She was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1988. In her last days she saw the first copies of her <span class="italic">Political Economy in Vietnam</span> (1990), with a preface by Ved Prakash Vatuk in which he described her as &#145;soft as a lotus, firm as a rock&#146;&#151;a true Indian whose life had combined the activities of all four Hindu castes: seeking and imparting knowledge, struggle, speaking for the voiceless, and service to others. She was still studying Vietnamese to facilitate the long-term studies in Vietnam she was planning. The <span class="italic">Economic and Political Weekly</span> in Delhi (a favourite vehicle) published, during her last weeks, her self-critical article on imperialism acknowledging Soviet and Chinese depredations. But she never abandoned socialism or her hopes for a better future for poor villagers.<br>
<br>After four months' illness with cancer, Kathleen Gough died in Vancouver on 8 September 1990, and was buried on 13 September in Capilano View cemetery, Vancouver, after a service which she has herself devised, including psalms and the Hebrew kaddish. She loved India and enjoyed and admired Canada but she was proud of her roots in Yorkshire and maintained ties with her family and former teachers there, and a devotion to the quiet beauty of its countryside.<br>
