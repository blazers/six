<span class="headword">Maitland,  Charles</span>, third earl of Lauderdale  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1691), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, was the third son of John Maitland, second Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (<i>d</i>. 1645), created earl of Lauderdale in 1624, and his wife, Lady Isabel (1594&#150;1638), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25113/', "Alexander Seton, first earl of Dunfermline")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17827/', "John Maitland, later duke of Lauderdale (1616&#150;1682)")</script>, was his elder brother. Little is known of his early life. On 18 November 1652 he married Elizabeth, younger daughter and heir of Richard Lauder, thereby acquiring the sizeable estate of Hatton in Edinburghshire. Shortly after Charles II's restoration Maitland was made master and general of the Scottish mint, and on 15 June 1661 was sworn a privy councillor. Despite having no previous legal training or judicial experience, he was admitted an ordinary lord of session on 8 June 1669, assuming the title Lord Hatton, and that year was also elected a parliamentary commissioner for the shire of Edinburgh and chosen as one of the lords of the articles. As he entered the highest levels of Scottish politics, his elder brother had acknowledged his reservations to the earl of Tweeddale the previous November, but relied upon his &#145;hope [that] he will mend his faults&#146;  (&#145;Letters&#146;, ed. Paton, 169), since &#145;he promises me to be a very good bairn&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 7023, fol. 299).<br>
<br>In February 1671 Hatton was appointed treasurer-depute and on 12 May 1672 created a baronet. After Lauderdale quarrelled with Tweeddale in 1674 Hatton assumed an increasingly prominent position, taking sole responsibility for the administration of Scottish affairs during his brother's absences in London. Widely unpopular, he became the focus of intense criticism and Tweeddale himself later commented that during the 1670s Hatton's power was so immense that &#145;the liberties, lives and fortuns of the wholl kingdom depended mor upon him &amp; wer mor at his disposal then ever they have upon any Commissioner or favourite, yea almost any of our Kings&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 3134, fol. 119). In 1675 a Scottish informant provided the earl of Shaftesbury with an account of Hatton's controversial attempts to influence town council elections in Edinburgh, but acknowledged that he could also have &#145;wearied yow with a thousand passages of the Impertinent, passionat Carriage of the Lord Hatton &hellip; in whom there is as much folly, Insolency and bossines as ever met in one breast&#146;. Hence the informant wondered why Lauderdale &#145;will needs mak a Statesman of him&#146;, even &#145;tho God and nature had made him a mad foole&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/24/5/291). The following year William Douglas, third earl of Queensberry, wrote to the duke of Hamilton believing that since &#145;all complain off him and ar censible of his baisnes&#146;, the Scottish political establishment should not delay in &#145;pitching upon him as the sacrefeis&#146;, confident that all political grievances would be removed by that &#145;single act of justeice to the nation off destroying him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hamilton MSS</span>).<br>
<br>During the duke of York's temporary Scottish residence in the late 1670s and early 1680s Hatton lived in Canongate House (now Queensberry House), Edinburgh, and aimed to extend his family's political influence by having the property extensively redesigned to incorporate a prominent belvedere tower oriented towards the palace of Holyroodhouse. Following the decline of his brother's political influence, his fortunes began to change, however, and he was found guilty of perjury by the Scottish parliament in 1681, relating to a previous miscarriage of justice in the case of the covenanter James Mitchell in 1678, and further allegations insinuated his likely involvement in bribing witnesses in other covenanting trials. In June 1682 Hatton was also deprived of his office of general of the mint when he was convicted of embezzlement and adulteration of the coinage, having not only circulated a defective silver coinage and issued a light copper coinage, but also having purchased the nation's superior coinage at a vastly reduced rate to use as bullion, culminating in the decision to close the mint itself until 1687.<br>
<br>On his brother's death on 20 or 24 August 1682 Hatton succeeded as third earl of Lauderdale, but did not acquire the additional titles of duke of Lauderdale and marquess of March, which then became extinct. With Sir John Falconer he was found guilty of malversation the following year, but their original fine of &pound;72,000 was reduced to &pound;20,000 by Charles II and on 11 March 1686 Lauderdale was readmitted as a privy councillor. During the revolution of 1688&#150;9 he was sent to Edinburgh Castle &#145;upon information and refusing to swear allegiance&#146;  (Melville, 180), but no further action was taken and he was probably released soon afterwards. He and his wife had two daughters and six sons, of whom the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17832/', "Richard Maitland (1653&#150;1695)")</script>, became fourth earl of Lauderdale when his father died on 6 June 1691. Their second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17828/', "John Maitland")</script>, became the fifth earl.<br>
