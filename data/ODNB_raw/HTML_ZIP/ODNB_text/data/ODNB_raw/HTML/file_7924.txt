<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, first earl of Douglas and earl of Mar  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1384), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7860/', "Archibald Douglas (1294?&#150;1333)")</script>, guardian of Scotland in 1332&#150;3, and Beatrice, daughter of Alexander Lindsay, lord of Crawford.<h2>
<a name="Securinganinheritance"></a>Securing an inheritance</h2>The deaths in the battle of Halidon Hill both of William's father and of his cousin, William, lord of Douglas, son of Sir James Douglas, made William and his elder brother, John, heirs to the Douglas estates. Their uncle Hugh succeeded to lands which had largely passed into English or Balliol allegiance, but, a former ecclesiastic, he does not seem to have married, and may have designated his nephews as his heirs. The significance of William and John explains their dispatch to France for safety, probably in 1334, when David II also went into exile. For the next thirteen years William remained in France. In 1340 his brother John was in David II's household at Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard in Normandy and it is likely that William also reached adulthood in this Franco-Scottish environment. The death of John in France between 1340 and 1342 made William heir to the Douglas estates. Probably because of his youth, though, he stayed in France in 1341, when King David returned to Scotland.<br>
<br>While he was in France, William Douglas's rights were eroded by the impact of war on southern Scotland. Active leadership in the Douglas family's border lordships was provided not by Hugh, nicknamed the Dull, but by a distant, junior kinsman, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7923/', "Sir William Douglas")</script> of Lothian. Douglas of Lothian recovered the local communities of the forest of Selkirk, Liddesdale, and upper Annandale from English allegiance and in the early 1340s was looking to secure his local leadership by obtaining formal rights in the lands of the senior Douglas line. He sought to achieve this through championing the rights of the young and exiled heir to the Douglas lands, who was also his godson. In 1337 the interests of the young Douglas heirs were represented by their mother, but by 1342 Douglas of Lothian was claiming to act as William's guardian. His aims in this role were predatory. In February 1342 his ward's claim to Liddesdale was rejected, and he subsequently secured the lordship for himself. On 26 May Douglas of Lothian engineered a charter of entail to the Douglas estates. In this Hugh the Dull resigned his rights to Douglasdale, Selkirk Forest, Lauderdale, and other estates, which were granted to his nephew William. The succession of the younger William to these lands was overshadowed by the insertion of Douglas of Lothian as his heir, an act followed by the grant of a number of estates by Hugh to this ambitious kinsman. Although he had become lord of Douglas, William remained in France. The threat to his survival now came not from England, but from his own guardian and heir. The rights of the absentee lord were usurped by his well-backed and aggressive relation.<br>
<br>The lessons of this situation were not wasted on William, lord of Douglas. He recognized the Scottish defeat at Nevilles Cross in 1346, in which Sir William Douglas, now lord of Liddesdale, was captured, as his own opportunity. In 1347 he returned to Scotland with the aim of recovering his southern lands from English allegiance. He regained his ancestral lordship of Douglas and was received into Edinburgh Castle by his uncle David Lindsay of Crawford. With the support of the Edinburgh burgesses he then moved south. He was welcomed by the men of Selkirk Forest and defeated a force of English garrison troops and men from Teviotdale, forcing some of the latter to return to Scottish allegiance. For the next decade Douglas's activities centred on local warfare against the English and their allies in the marches, leading campaigns in the Merse, Tweeddale, and Galloway. Such war leadership had a political purpose. The submission of the local landowners of these regions combined a return to Scottish allegiance with the acceptance of Douglas's own lordship. When, for example, Dungal MacDowell and the men of Galloway &#145;surrendered&#146; to him at Cumnock in 1353, this may have marked the extension of Douglas's influence into the province where he held the lands of Buittle, the traditional seat of the lords of Galloway.<br>
<br>William's achievements in local warfare were complicated by the continued ambitions of his godfather, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale. Although an English prisoner, Douglas of Liddesdale was allowed increasing liberty to return to Scotland, where he acted as David II's agent in discussions with the Scottish estates for the king's release on English terms. His appearances on William's council, attested by three charters, suggest he was also seeking to maintain influence in the marches. The tension this must have created between William, lord of Douglas, and Douglas of Liddesdale burst into open conflict in 1352. Initially with David II's backing, Douglas of Liddesdale worked against his kinsman with English help, using Liddesdale, Eskdale, and English-held Teviotdale as bases for his efforts. Despite this opposition, William retained his hold on Scottish border communities and a charter of 1353 suggests that Douglas of Liddesdale may have been brought to recognize the former's lordship. In any event, William took advantage of any improvement in relations that resulted to have his rival ambushed and killed in Ettrick Forest in August 1353, ensuring there was no renewal of the conflict.<h2>
<a name="Warandlordship"></a>War and lordship</h2>William Douglas's success in border warfare and in dealing with Douglas of Liddesdale stemmed from the wide network of allies and adherents he had built up since 1347. With considerable long-term significance for Scotland, he provided a focus of lordship for men in the middle marches. While his hold on Teviotdale families, such as the Kerrs, Rutherfords, and Colvilles, remained insecure into the 1380s, he probably brought families based in the upland areas of the borders, such as the Glendinnings, Gledstones, and Pringles, firmly into Scottish allegiance; by 1355 he was also warden of the east march. Douglas acted as a principal leader for important Lothian families which had been active in resisting the English since 1334, winning support and a commitment to further warfare by grants of land in Lauderdale. The maintenance of this community's backing was crucial to his regional dominance. He arranged three successive marriages between his frequently widowed sister, Eleanor, and influential Lothian knights, and, as a base for his influence, constructed Tantallon Castle in his barony of North Berwick. His position in Lothian was aided by close relations with Patrick Dunbar, earl of March. The two magnates generally co-operated in war and politics and in a truce of 1356 Douglas specifically included Dunbar's lands in his protection. By 1356, though, Douglas was the senior partner. His status in the marches was confirmed by his leadership of Scottish resistance to Edward III's invasion of that year. In the aftermath of the attack Douglas rounded off this period of military success by capturing Hermitage Castle in Liddesdale.<br>
<br>David II had already recognized Douglas's importance. In 1354 he had confirmed Douglas in all the lands of his uncle Sir James and his father, including many granted previously to Douglas of Liddesdale. David also gave William powers to lead the men of upper Clydesdale, Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, and Peeblesshire, acknowledging Douglas's military role. When the king was released by the English in 1357, his apparent benevolence went further: in early 1358 William was created earl of Douglas. Although the terms of this creation are unknown, it secured William's status. David also either confirmed or appointed Douglas as justiciar south of Forth, and may have consented to his marriage about 1357 to Margaret, sister and heir of Thomas, earl of Mar. However, this political honeymoon was short-lived. By 1363 David was successfully promoting royal authority, especially in Lothian, winning such men as William Ramsay and Douglas's own cousin Archibald Douglas, known as Archibald the Grim, to his service. At the same time the king displayed hostility towards the earl's allies. Douglas's associate Thomas Stewart, earl of Angus, died in royal custody in 1361 and in early 1363 David seized Mar's castle of Kildrummy. Douglas feared that the settlement between Mar and the king would end his hopes to succeed his brother-in-law, and this may have been one of the reasons for his joining Robert Stewart and Patrick, earl of March, in open rebellion in 1363, claiming to be acting to obtain &#145;wiser government&#146;. While Stewart quickly came to terms, Douglas stayed in arms for several weeks before being defeated at Lanark.<h2>
<a name="Relationswiththecrown13631371"></a>Relations with the crown, 1363&#150;1371</h2>David's principal aim after the revolt was to detach Douglas from Stewart. He exacted no major retribution from Douglas, but appears to have associated him with attempts to deny Stewart's rights of succession to the throne. At the same time, though, David also supported rivals for Douglas's lands and influence in the south. These included two of William's kinsmen, Archibald the Grim and James Douglas of Dalkeith, the nephew and under form of law the coheir of Douglas of Liddesdale. William was made to relinquish several estates, among them Dalkeith and Buittle, to James and to accept Archibald as lord of Galloway and leading magnate in the west march. The succession of another royal prot&eacute;g&eacute;, George Dunbar, as earl of March in 1368 further isolated Douglas in the south. If the period of Anglo-Scottish truce since 1356 removed one threat to his lordship, the king seemed increasingly to represent another.<br>
<br>On the sudden death of David II in 1371 Earl William displayed his determination to prevent renewed royal pressure. In an assembly at Linlithgow Douglas challenged Robert Stewart's right to the throne. Later accounts suggest Douglas sought to become king himself, but his aims were clearly more limited. Though he may have threatened Robert with the revival of proposals made in the 1350s and 1360s to offer the throne to John of Gaunt, son of Edward III, his likeliest motive was a wish simply to demonstrate his own power, one which may have been directed as much against the Erskines, favourites of the late king, as against David II's successor. In the event, Douglas allowed himself to be bought off by Robert. He was restored to the justiciarship south of Forth, his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7890/', "James Douglas")</script> was married to the new king's daughter, and both Douglases received large sums in cash and annuities. Moreover, while they had ultimately backed away from open defiance of Robert II, in 1371 William had received support from many former adherents of King David, who now needed a new protector. Old allies, such as Douglas's cousins the Lindsays, and new ones, such as the earl of March, worked closely with him in the 1370s. Even the marriage of his daughter, Isabella, to David II's favourite <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54171/', "Sir Malcolm Drummond")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54170/', "Drummond family")</script>], which had probably occurred against Douglas's will during the 1360s, worked in his favour after 1371.<h2>
<a name="Furthergains"></a>Further gains</h2>Drummond, the Lindsays, and his son's marriage made Douglas, who was a constant witness of royal charters, a member of the extended royal family and formed the basis for his alliance with John Stewart, earl of Carrick, the heir to the throne, and the only son of Robert II with interests in the south. Douglas's favoured position helped him to achieve his ambitions, implicit in his marriage, with regard to the earldom of Mar. In July 1377, following the death of Earl Thomas, Douglas travelled north with the king and was made earl of Mar, issuing his first charter from Kildrummy Castle on 27 July. He had obtained Kildrummy from the widowed countess, Margaret Stewart (<i>b</i>. 1353&times;62, <i>d</i>. in or before 1418), who received in return a 200 merk annuity for her terce and the right to reside in Tantallon. This arrangement had a personal side. Margaret became William's mistress and probably about 1380 gave birth to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7883/', "George Douglas, the future earl of Angus")</script>. This relationship also brought William the support of Margaret's own connection. She was the daughter and heir of Douglas's former associate Thomas, earl of Angus, and would prove to be a determined defender of her inheritance and an influential figure in Haddingtonshire.<br>
<br>Despite his new northern earldom, Earl William's interests continued to focus on the marches. In the 1370s he participated in escalating warfare in the region led by him, his fellow wardens, and lesser men, many of whom were his adherents. In 1380 he was leader of a raid which destroyed Penrith, and before this the renewal of warfare with the English march warden, Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, over Jedforest resulted in efforts by their respective governments to control their conflict. However, in spite of the active role in border diplomacy played by John Stewart, earl of Carrick, as &#145;lieutenant on the marches&#146;, by the early 1380s Douglas was taking a more aggressive line. This attitude was probably forced by the desire of his southern associates for warfare. Earl William, in particular, was looking beyond Scotland for allies in any conflict and, when the period of formal truce ended in early 1384, he immediately led an attack on Teviotdale which secured the lasting adherence to the Scottish crown of many local landowners. Appropriately, this proved to be the earl's last public act. Before 24 April he had died at Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire, of a fever contracted during the campaign.<h2>
<a name="Anationalandinternationalfigure"></a>A national and international figure</h2>Douglas was not simply a Scottish magnate. The effect of his formative years in France was to give him European interests. In 1356, once he was established in Scotland, he took a retinue of forty knights through England to France, with the aim of travelling as pilgrims, perhaps to Spain. Instead he joined the French army, which met defeat at the battle of Poitiers. Douglas was knighted by Jean II of France before the fight and consulted for his military experience, but escaped the field only through the efforts of his household. He also held lands in France, at St Sa&euml;ns in Normandy, and retained his continental connections throughout his life. He had co-operated with French troops in Scotland in 1355, and in 1378 one of his servants, Andrew Mercer, led a combined Scottish, French, and Castilian fleet in attacks on English shipping, his efforts possibly reflecting an alliance entered by his master (at a time when effective royal leadership was lacking) with kingdoms involved in war with England. As the actions of Douglas's successors would show, such a continental perspective was not beyond the capacity of the Douglas family, and may have prepared the way for the Franco-Scottish campaign of 1385. Earl William certainly impressed foreign contemporaries. The chronicler Jean Froissart clearly retained a good impression of the Douglas castle of Dalkeith, which he visited in 1365, and spoke favourably of both William and his son James.<br>
<br>Earl William was also aware of his image within Scotland. To enhance his own status during the 1340s and 1350s he consciously appealed to the heroic reputation of his uncle Sir James Douglas. He adopted the red heart in his coat of arms as a reminder of James's expedition to Spain in 1330, carrying Robert I's heart against the Moors. He himself may have intended to repeat his uncle's journey when he crossed to France in 1356 and, despite periods of friction, established close relations with Melrose Abbey, where King Robert's heart was buried on its return to Scotland. These attempts to glory in his predecessor's achievements owed much to William's own difficulties, in particular with Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale. In his leadership and in this image building William sought first to supplant his rival and then to heal the rifts within the Douglas family caused by Douglas of Liddesdale's murder. In 1360 he went so far as to endow masses for his guardian at Melrose Abbey. On his own death in 1384 Melrose was chosen as the site of his tomb. The site symbolized his successful creation of his family's dominance in the central borders and of a dynastic image which his successors exploited to great effect in extending their lordship.<br>
