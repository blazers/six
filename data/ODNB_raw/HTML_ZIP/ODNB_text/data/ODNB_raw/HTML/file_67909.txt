<span class="headword">Johnson,  Leonard Benker <span class="st"> [Len]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1974), <span class="occ">boxer and political activist</span>, was born at 12 Barnabas Street, Clayton, Manchester, on 22 October 1902, the first of three sons and a daughter of William Benker Johnson, mechanical engineer and booth boxer, and his wife, Margaret Maher. Early in his life Johnson moved to Leeds, where his father worked as a waiter. Here he attended both St Silas and Park Lane elementary schools in Hunslet before returning in 1914 to Manchester, where he was employed in a local gas engine makers. His first professional boxing contest was in Manchester in 1921. After two wins and two losses in his first four fights, he joined a travelling boxing booth, but this only lasted six months. With nine contests (seven wins and two losses) in 1922, a period when he combined his work on the boxing booth with his professional career, he established himself as a capable if inexperienced boxer. However, by the end of 1923&#151;a year in which he had his first fight abroad (in Copenhagen) and his first fight in London&#151;he was good enough to be ranked among Britain's top six middleweights.<br>
<br>Fourteen wins and a draw out of twenty-four fights followed in 1924. In the following year Johnson firmly established himself as one of the country's, and the continent's, leading boxers. In February and September 1925 he defeated Roland Todd, the reigning British middleweight champion: both fights took place in Manchester. Owing to the colour bar in operation in Britain at the time, however, black boxers could not contest British titles, and despite his achievements Johnson was not allowed to fight for the championship, even though Todd was willing to meet him a third time with the title at stake. As a result of his victories over Todd, opposition to the ban surfaced in the dedicated boxing press for the first time. In June 1925 Johnson also outpointed Herman Van't Hof of the Netherlands, who became European champion in 1926.<br>
<br>Like most top boxers of the time, Johnson then travelled to Australia for a six-month tour, although in his case the disenchantment he felt at the lack of championship opportunities probably forced the trip. After eight contests (six victories) he returned to Manchester, where in his first contest he defeated George West, who had just lost to Tommy Milligan for the British title. When Johnson also won their rematch six weeks later, calls were again made in the national boxing press for Johnson to be allowed to fight for the title. However, the boxing authorities did not lift the ban until 1947 and Johnson, despite his undoubted skill, was destined never to fight for the British title. Over the next seven years he met most of the top British and European boxers, including two meetings with Len Harvey. Johnson outpointed Harvey in London in January 1927 but lost a rematch&#151;which many thought of as an &#145;unofficial&#146; title match&#151;in May 1932, by which time Harvey was British champion.<br>
<br>After retiring from the ring in 1933 Johnson ran a travelling boxing booth for a number of years, until he was forced to sell it in 1939 as the Second World War approached. After the war, during which he served in civil defence, Johnson drove buses and lorries for a living and he continued in this employment until 1972. He married on 17 November 1926 Annie Forshaw, a bookbinder. About 1945, however, their marriage broke down and Johnson settled with Marie Reid (who had three children of her own, and later adopted her sister's three children), with whom he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Near the end of the Second World War, Johnson joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, of which he remained a member until his death. Along with C. L. R. James, George Padmore, and other black radicals such as Jomo Kenyatta, he was heavily involved in the Pan-African Congress held in Manchester in July 1945. Involvement here also led Johnson to establish the New International Society with Wilf Charles and Syd Booth. He also stood as a Communist Party member in the Manchester council elections in 1947, 1949 (when he spoke at various left-wing meetings with Paul Robeson), 1950, 1955, 1956, and 1962. During the 1950s he visited Russia.<br>
<br>Although Johnson's communist affiliations make him almost unique among British sportsmen, it is his boxing career for which he is most famous. He was one of only a handful of highly talented black British boxers active before the Second World War, and was probably the most skilful black British boxer until the emergence of Randolph (Randy) Turpin in the early 1950s. He met all the leading British and European boxers of his day, and defeated most of them. However, owing to the colour bar in British boxing, which was lifted by the time Turpin came to the fore, he was unable to contest a British title, even though many contemporaries, including boxing journalists, rated him as the best middleweight in Europe about 1925&#150;8. Johnson died in Oldham General Hospital on 28 September 1974 and was cremated at Manchester crematorium a few days later.<br>
