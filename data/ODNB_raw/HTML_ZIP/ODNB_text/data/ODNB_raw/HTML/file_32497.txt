<span class="headword">Collett, Sir  Henry</span>  (1836&#150;1901), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and botanist</span>, was born on 6 March 1836 at Thetford, Norfolk, the fourth son of the Revd William Collett (1796&#150;1865), perpetual curate of St Mary's, Thetford, and his second wife, Ellen Clarke, daughter of Leonard Shelford Bidwell of Thetford. Educated at Tonbridge School and at Addiscombe College (1853&#150;5), he entered the Bengal army on 8 June 1855, and joined the 51st Bengal native infantry on 6 August 1855 at Peshawar.<br>
<br>Collett served with the expeditions under Sir Sydney Cotton on the Yusufzai frontier in 1858, being present at the actions at Chingli and Sitana. He served in Oudh during the mutiny campaign of 1858&#150;9, and was at the storm and capture of the fort of Rampur Kussia by Sir Edward Robert Wetherall on 3 November 1858. During the uprising of 1862&#150;3 in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, Assam, he was present at the capture of Oomkoi, Nungarai, and at Oomkrong, where he was wounded in the ankle. He was mentioned in dispatches. Promoted captain in 1867, he served in the Abyssinian expedition, and was again mentioned in dispatches. He became major in 1875 and lieutenant-colonel in 1879. In the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&#150;80) he acted as quartermaster-general on the staff of Sir Frederick (afterwards Lord) Roberts, and was present at the capture of the Paiwar Pass, and in the operations in Khost valley and round Kabul in December 1879. He accompanied Roberts on the march from Kabul to Kandahar (August 1880) and commanded the 23rd pioneers at the battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was made CB on 22 February 1881. He was promoted colonel in 1884. During 1886&#150;8 he commanded the 3rd brigade in the expedition to Burma. He took part in the Karenni expedition in 1888 and commanded the eastern frontier district during the Chin Lushai expedition in 1889&#150;90, receiving the thanks of the government of India.<br>
<br>In 1891 Collett was prominent in the expedition to Manipur, and was left in command when the uprising of the Manipuris was suppressed, acting there temporarily but resolutely as chief commissioner of Assam. He received the thanks of the government of India, and was made KCB on 19 November 1891. From 1892 to 1893 he commanded the Peshawar district with the rank of major-general. He was given the reward for distinguished service and was placed by his own wish on the unemployed list on 8 June 1893. His military reputation was high, but increasing deafness unfitted him in his opinion for active duty.<br>
<br>Collett was a keen student of botany, in which he first became interested in 1878 during the Kurram valley expedition. He collected plants in Afghanistan, Algeria, Burma, the Canaries, Corsica, India, Java, and Spain. He was made a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1879, and published the results of his botanical work in the southern Shan States, Burma, in the society's journal. He was an original member of the Simla Naturalists' Society. In retirement he worked assiduously at the Royal Botanic Gardens herbarium, Kew, and at his death was preparing a handbook of the flora of Simla, which appeared posthumously, edited by W. B. Hemsley FRS, as <span class="italic">Flora Simlensis</span> (1902). He died, unmarried, at his residence, 21 Cranley Gardens, South Kensington, London, on 21 December 1901, and was buried in Charlton cemetery, Blackheath. His herbarium was presented by his family to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.<br>
