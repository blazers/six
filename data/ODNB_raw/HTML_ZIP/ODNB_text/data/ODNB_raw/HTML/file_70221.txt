<span class="headword">Gray <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Denison]</span>,  Dulcie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Dulcie Winifred Catherine  Savage Bailey]</span>  (1915&#150;2011), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born Dulcie Winifred Catherine Savage Bailey in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, on 20 November 1915 (though she often gave her birth year as 1919, and the exact date in November is uncertain), the younger daughter and youngest of three children of Arnold Savage Bailey (1881&#150;1935), lawyer and member of the federal council of the Federated Malay States, and his wife, Kate Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clulow Gray (1887&#150;1942), who died when the SS <i>Rooseboom</i> was torpedoed off Sumatra, having unwisely delayed her departure before the fall of Singapore.<br>
<br>Dulcie Savage Bailey was educated first at St Anthony's School in Wallingford, and became a boarder there from the age of four to eleven, while her parents were still in Malaya. Subsequently she was sent to Luckley School at Wokingham and finally to Leeson House, Swanage, where her sister was a student. Back home in Malaya at the age of fifteen, to a difficult family situation and at St Mary's School, Kuala Lumpur, she found some solace in games, painting, and writing short stories. This latter occupation stood her in good stead when she obtained a job writing for the <span class="italic">Malaya Tribune</span>, as the anonymous author of &#145;Our Fraser's Hill notes&#146;: she was by then teaching at Fraser's Hill School in Pahang. In 1936, having decided on an acting career, she worked her way back to London as governess to the child of a more affluent passenger. In 1937 she was accepted at the Webber-Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art, where she met her future husband, the actor <a href="#cosubject_70221">Michael Denison [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom she married on 29 April 1939 at St Saviour's Church, Chelsea. They had no children but remained happily married until his death nearly sixty years later.<br>
<br>While war service claimed Denison, Dulcie Gray (she took her mother's family name for her professional career) pursued her career on stage in repertory at Aberdeen, having her first professional role there in <span class="italic">Hay Fever</span>, and in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Harrogate. She had a continuing role in a long-running radio serial, <span class="italic">Front Line Family</span>, which touched a responsive chord for wartime listeners. In London she played Shakespearean heroines at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, and came to serious critical notice as the pathetic Rose in <span class="italic">Brighton Rock</span> in 1943. When the film was made several years later she was, at thirty-two, deemed too old for the camera's scrutiny, but by this time she had appeared successfully in several popular melodramas for Gainsborough Studios.<br>
<br>After an uncredited &#145;bit&#146; part in <span class="italic">Banana Ridge</span> (1942) and the propaganda short <span class="italic">Victory Wedding</span> (1944) with John Mills, Gray made her feature d&eacute;but as one of <span class="italic">2000 Women</span> (1944), in which she and Thora Hird, in very roomy working clothes, wandered a woman's internment site with brooms and pails. In 1945 she played the maid in <span class="italic">A Place of One's Own</span> without resort to caricature or patronage, but her major chances in cinema came with a batch of movies that followed. In <span class="italic">They Were Sisters</span> (1945) as the gentle wife of a sadistic husband (James Mason), driven to dipsomania, she more than held her own with the experienced Phyllis Calvert and Anne Crawford as the other sisters. In this domestic drama of contrasting aspirations and outcomes she moved convincingly from pretty vulnerability to poignant dependence and untimely death.<br>
<br>Success in this film led to a gallery of variously long-suffering and plucky wives in Gray's ensuing films. She was a wholesome partner to Peter Murray-Hill in the wildly popular <span class="italic">Madonna of the Seven Moons</span> (1945), contrasting with Calvert's split-personality type and Jean Kent's sexy temptress; was nearly killed by a mentally disturbed Eric Portman in <span class="italic">Wanted for Murder</span> (1946); was the gentler-mannered sister who does not succumb to Italy and passion in <span class="italic">A Man About the House</span> (1947); and was endlessly understanding, first as a psychiatrist's troubled wife in <span class="italic">Mine Own Executioner</span> (1947), and, across generations, even more so in <span class="italic">My Brother Jonathan</span> (1948). To all of these roles she brought not only an engaging oval-faced sweetness of expression, but also a touching freshness and sympathy that stopped them from being mere stereotypes. She and Denison co-starred in <span class="italic">Jonathan</span> and appeared together in her remaining films of this period, including the romantic melodrama <span class="italic">The Glass Mountain</span> (1949, as another forbearing wife) and the neat thriller <span class="italic">The Franchise Affair</span> (1951). In the last scenes of <span class="italic">A Man Could Get Killed</span> (1966), she revealed a comic flair that films rarely tapped, but her subsequent long career on stage and television gave her more diverse opportunities.<br>
<br>Film roles dried up in the 1950s, but Gray was so busy on stage, and later on television, that she can scarcely have noticed. She appeared in about seventy plays, in London and elsewhere, frequently touring, and starring with her husband in twenty-six. The last such was <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span>, in which she played Lady Markby to great comic effect, in 1992, subsequently touring with this and making her Broadway d&eacute;but in it in 1996, aged eighty. Her theatrical range included No&euml;l Coward (<span class="italic">Hay Fever</span>), Ibsen (<span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span>), a Shakespeare recital with Denison in Berlin, Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Priestley's <span class="italic">Time and the Conways</span>, Agatha Christie's <span class="italic">A Murder Is Announced</span>, and many more. A list can barely hint at how busy and versatile she was. She also toured in the Middle East (in <span class="italic">Relatively Speaking</span>, 1981) and much earlier in Australia starred to notable acclaim in the then daring <span class="italic">Tea and Sympathy</span> (1956). She became a household name on television in her seventies for her role in the long-running series <span class="italic">Howards' Way</span> (1985&#150;90).<br>
<br>Gray wrote (and starred in) one play, <span class="italic">Love Affair</span> (1956), was the author of over twenty popular crime novels, beginning with <span class="italic">Murder on the Stairs</span> (1957) and ending with <span class="italic">Mirror Image</span> (1987), and co-author with Denison of <span class="italic">The Actor and His World</span> (1964). She was also an authority on butterflies, winning a <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span> information award for her book about them, <span class="italic">Butterflies on My Mind</span> (1978). She and Michael Denison were both appointed CBE in 1983. She lived latterly at Denville Hall, the actor's retirement home in Northwood, Middlesex, where she died of bronchopneumonia on 16 November 2011.<br>
<br>Gray's husband, <a name="cosubject_70221"></a><span class="headword">(John) Michael Terence Wellesley Denison</span>  (1915&#150;1998), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 1 November 1915 at Rylstone, Town Field, Doncaster, the son of Gilbert Dixon Denison (1888&#150;1959), paint manufacturer, and his wife, Marie Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bain (1888&#150;1915). His mother died when he was three weeks old, and he was brought up by a paternal aunt and her husband. He was educated at Harrow School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read modern languages and acted with the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Graduating with a second-class degree in French and German in 1937, he went to the Webber-Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art, where he met Dulcie Gray, and after appearing in Frinton made his West End d&eacute;but in 1938, playing a variety of roles with J. B. Priestley's London Mask Theatre, at the Westminster Theatre. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Signals and then the intelligence corps. By the time of his demobilization his wife was a famous film star, and he initially found it difficult to be taken seriously as an actor himself, but his roles with her in <span class="italic">My Brother Jonathan</span> and <span class="italic">The Glass Mountain</span> helped establish his reputation. Tall, elegant, and charming, he appeared most frequently as English gentlemen of various sorts, seemingly embodying the values of a particular class and time, especially as Algernon in Anthony Asquith's benchmark production of <span class="italic">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>, which Denison regarded as his most memorable screen role. Like his wife, he seemed in constant demand on stage and on television, though he did make one last notable big-screen appearance in <span class="italic">Shadowlands</span> (1993). He was probably best known in the title role of <span class="italic">Boyd QC</span>, which ran on ITV from 1956 to 1964, but he appeared in countless other television roles and continued acting in the West End, particularly in light comedy, almost until his death; his last appearance was with his wife in <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span> (1996), on Broadway. He wrote two volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">Overture and Beginners</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">Double Act</span> (1985), as well as four entries for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> (including that on No&euml;l Coward). He was a keen watercolourist and golfer, and an avid fan of cricket. In the acting world he was much loved for his courtesy, modesty, and kindness. For many years he was active in the actors' trade union, Equity. He was working on a biography of J. B. Priestley (completed by his wife and published in 2000) when he died at his home with Dulcie Gray, 1 Shardeloes, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, on 22 July 1998, of cancer, after a short illness.<br>
