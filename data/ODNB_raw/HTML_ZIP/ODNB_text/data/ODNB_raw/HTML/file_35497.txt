<span class="headword">Petter,  (William) Edward Willoughby</span>  (1908&#150;1968), <span class="occ">aircraft designer</span>, was born on 8 August 1908 at Highgate, Middlesex, the oldest in the family of three sons and one daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48101/', "Ernest Willoughby Petter (1873&#150;1954)")</script>, co-founder and chairman of Petters Ltd, oil engine and aircraft manufacturers of Yeovil, Somerset, and his wife, Angela Emma (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of Henry Petter of Calcutta. He was educated at Marlborough College and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a first class in the mechanical sciences tripos in 1929 and shared the John Bernard Seely prize in aeronautics after concentrating on aerodynamics and aircraft engineering in his third year. Cambridge University had established a chair in aeronautical engineering in 1919, and most of the leading British aeronautical engineers were Cambridge graduates.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge, Teddy Petter, as he was commonly known, joined Westland Aircraft Works, the subsidiary of Petters Ltd, and after two and a half years as a graduate apprentice working in the machine and assembly shops and in the design office he became personal assistant to the managing director, Robert Bruce, in 1932. Also in 1932 he married Claude Marguerite Juliette (<i>d</i>. 1975), daughter of Louis Munier of Geneva, a Swiss League of Nations official; they had three daughters. When Sir Ernest Petter decided that his son should be co-opted onto the board of directors of Westland Aircraft Works as technical director in 1934, Bruce and several other older members of the firm resigned. In 1935 Westland Aircraft Works was detached from its parent company, becoming Westland Aircraft Ltd.<br>
<br>At first the Air Ministry lacked confidence in Petter's designs because of his youth and inexperience, and he had no success in tendering for Air Ministry specifications. However, he had powerful friends, including Roy Fedden at Bristol, who convinced the ministry of Petter's technical brilliance, and Westland was invited to tender for specification A.39/34 for an army co-operation aircraft. This led to a contract for two prototypes, designed by Arthur Davenport, the chief engineer, under Petter's technical direction, followed by an order for 169 aircraft in 1936. This plane was later named the Lysander, and between 1935 and 1942 more than 1400 were built at Yeovil. To cope with the production of the Lysanders Petter successfully challenged his father's proposal that the firm should merge with British Marine Aircraft Ltd, and instead persuaded it to build a large new assembly shop in Yeovil. When John Brown Ltd, the Clydeside shipbuilding firm, took over Westland in 1938, Teddy Petter remained as technical director.<br>
<br>Petter's other most successful designs were the Whirlwind, a four-cannon fighter, which won a contract for 175 planes in 1937 with the first planes delivered to the RAF in 1940, and the Welkin, a high altitude fighter, accepted in 1941. Although more than a hundred of these were built, there was little call for them as there turned out to be very few attacks at high altitude. Most of the Westland production during the Second World War consisted of subcontracted Spitfire and Seafire aircraft. At the peak of its production Westland was building twenty Spitfires a week. Meanwhile Petter was working on the early stages of an Admiralty specification for a strike fighter to be launched from an aircraft-carrier.<br>
<br>In December 1944 Petter resigned from Westland Aircraft Ltd after failing to obtain the board's agreement to his taking over responsibility for production as well as design. He had begun work on a government specification for a twin-engined jet fighter bomber to replace the Mosquito, and was allowed by the managing director, Eric Mensforth, to take the designs with him, to the English Electric Company in Preston, Lancashire, where he was appointed chief engineer of the aircraft division. English Electric had re-entered the aircraft manufacturing business in 1938, subcontracting the mass production of airframes, and had been making Halifax bombers. The company had been without a design office since 1923, but in 1944 the decision was taken to continue to build aircraft after the end of the war, and as there would be little subcontract work, a design team and development centre were needed. In 1944 English Electric was one of the companies invited by the government to develop a jet bomber, and the managing director, George Nelson (later first Baron Nelson of Stafford), approached Petter, asking him to form and head a design team. The government specification had changed, as the Air Ministry decided it wanted a high altitude jet bomber, and Petter's design won a Ministry of Supply contract for four prototypes in 1946. Later named the Canberra, this made its first flight in 1949, and its first public display at that year's Farnborough Air Show generated great excitement, as it flew at double the speed of previous bombers. This was the first British jet bomber, and its success moved English Electric to the forefront of British aviation. The Canberra was chosen by the United States Air Force: known as the B 57, it was the first British military aircraft to be built in the United States for over forty years. More than 1300 Canberras were built in Britain, the United States, and Australia, and it was still being used by the RAF in the 1980s and served in the Falklands War. Petter's other important design for English Electric was a supersonic fighter, with swept back wings, which developed into the Lightning.<br>
<br>In 1950 Petter resigned from English Electric, just as suddenly as he had previously resigned from Westland, and for the same reason, that he found it difficult to work with colleagues in other departments and wanted to be in charge of production as well as design, and to have his own experimental shop. When this was refused, he joined Folland Aircraft Ltd, a small subcontractor company in Hamble, Hampshire, as chief engineer, taking several members of his English Electric design team with him. After the death of Henry Folland in 1954 Petter became managing director. At Folland he designed a small jet fighter, the Gnat. More than three hundred were sold to the Ministry of Aviation, as well as sales to India, Finland, and Yugoslavia, and a later version, the Gnat trainer, became standard equipment in the RAF Flying Training Command. In 1962 Folland Aircraft Ltd was taken over by the Hawker Siddeley Group; Petter resigned as he did not want to work in a large organization again, and he left the aircraft industry altogether.<br>
<br>Petter was a brilliant designer, one of the leading aeronautical engineers of his time, but his eccentricity and authoritarian approach alienated his colleagues. He was conceited and had a reputation for rejecting any idea that he had not originated. Harald Penrose, chief test pilot at Westland, described him as &#145;poetical looking&#146;, and he had intellectual interests, particularly in philosophy. He never learned to fly.<br>
<br>Petter was elected a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1944 and was awarded its silver medal in 1950. In 1951 he was made a CBE. When he left Folland he decided to devote the rest of his life to prayer and meditation, and moved with his family to Switzerland. In an attempt to cure his wife of Parkinson's disease, Petter, his wife, and youngest daughter joined a small religious community which practised faith healing, and, dressed in a monk's habit, he continually prayed for her recovery. They later moved to the same order in France. Petter died in Beruges, France, on 1 May 1968.<br>
