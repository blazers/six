<span class="headword">Hoskins,  William George</span>  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">historian of the English landscape</span>, was born on 22 May 1908 in Exeter, the eldest of four sons of William George Hoskins (1873&#150;1955), baker, and his wife, Alice Beatrice (1879&#150;1966), daughter of John Dymond of Silverton, Devon. He was born at his grandparents' house, 54 St David's Hill. His parents lived in Little Silver. His grandfather, William George Hoskins (1835&#150;1904) was also an Exeter baker. At three years of age he first attended Hoopern Street infants' school, next the Episcopal infants' school, and from 1915 the Episcopal Boys' School. In the summer of 1918 he won a scholarship to Hele's School, Exeter. He entered the University College of Exeter in 1925, and completed the BSc (Econ) degree in 1927, aged nineteen years. He immediately began research for the MSc (Econ), completing in 1929 a thesis, &#145;The rise and decline of the serge industry in the south-west of England&#146;.<br>
<br>Hoskins taught for one year at Exeter, and moved in 1930 for another year to Bradford Technical College, teaching economics and commercial subjects for the BComm degree. Stronger but latent interests were already evident in his attendance at lectures by Arthur Raistrick on local archaeology. In 1931 he was appointed assistant lecturer in economics in the department of geography and commerce at Leicester University College, but later gave his opinion of economics as distasteful, arid, and wrongheaded. More congenial from the beginning was his voluntary teaching of evening students at Vaughan Working Men's College, which had become an extramural department of the University College; here he gave courses on the antiquities and archaeology of Leicestershire, and took students to museums and into the country on fieldwork. These interests were much stimulated by a flourishing archaeological society in Leicestershire, and a rich collection of books on local history, bestowed on the college library by Thomas Hatton.<br>
<br>Hoskins's post was impermanent and insecure, and to improve his prospects elsewhere he completed in 1937 a PhD thesis (as a London University external student) entitled &#145;The ownership and occupation of land in Devonshire, 1650&#150;1800&#146;. By 1938 he was responsible for most of the teaching for the BSc (Econ) and BComm degrees, and by 1941 was single-handed in the department. But the college could not secure his deferment from military service and the department closed. In July 1941 he was called to work as a statistician with the Central Price Regulation Committee of the Board of Trade in London, and so remained until 1945. He detested London, but spent his leisure in libraries, the Public Record Office, and bookshops, gathering local material on Devon and Leicestershire, and publishing articles which exploited in a fresh way local documents such as wills, probate inventories, and poll tax and subsidy lists. One essay on the deserted villages of Leicestershire coincided with a similar investigation in Warwickshire by Maurice Beresford and the two scholars thereby opened up the possibilities of landscape history in a direction which excited immediate attention, and had wide repercussions thereafter for history and archaeology. Hoskins's work on probate inventories also revealed their value in elucidating local farming specialities and the layout of domestic buildings; so he launched agricultural history and the study of vernacular architecture on new and broader paths with far-reaching consequences.<br>
<br>After the war Hoskins debated a different career, in the civil service, in local government, or in educational administration, but the planned expansion of university education, and the urgings of R. H. Tawney, persuaded him to accept an invitation to return to Leicester in January 1946. Jack Simmons was appointed to head the department of history in 1947, and since he was also a Devon man with a strong interest in landscape and buildings, as well as being a specialist in colonial history and railways, the two formed a strong alliance in promoting local history. Further powerful support came from the principal of the college, F. L. Attenborough, originally an Anglo-Saxon historian, who was a fine photographer, and who accompanied Hoskins on many of his exploratory journeys through the midland countryside. Attenborough proposed the setting up of a department of English local history to allow Hoskins freedom for his research; it was established in 1948. This move was a milestone in claiming for local history a respectable place in academic studies, though that place was not generally conceded until decades later, when the published results of many local studies were seen to revise, even overturn, many old historical platitudes.<br>
<br>Publications for the Festival of Britain in 1951 brought an invitation to Hoskins to write two books in a series, <span class="roman">About Britain</span>, for which he wrote <span class="italic">Chilterns to Black Country</span> (1951) and <span class="italic">East Midlands and the Peak</span> (1951), thereby venturing into less familiar territory. He had already in 1946 published <span class="italic">Heritage of Leicestershire</span> and through a correspondence initiated by a reader who happened to be lecturing at the Leicester School of Architecture, struck up a warm, admiring friendship with Hope Bagenal, architect, and expert on building acoustics, who had a philosophy that saw &#145;the essence of civilisation&#146; in common things. He exhorted Hoskins to be more meditative and leisurely in his judgements, curbing his inclination to be &#145;impatient and swift&#146;. Something of that influence is defined in Hoskins's dedication of his comprehensive survey of Devon to &#145;Hope Bagenal, Poet and Topographer&#146;.<br>
<br>Bagenal's architectural expertise and questionings sharpened Hoskins's attention and skills when inspecting buildings, and expanded his thinking generally on the connections between economic development and phases of building activity. He published in 1953 a seminal article, &#145;The rebuilding of rural England, 1570&#150;1640&#146;, which galvanized research on its bold proposition, and, although the claim for a fundamental &#145;rebuilding&#146; of rural England in that period has been refined and modified since then, the essay stands as another challenging and path-breaking guide into new historical territory.<br>
<br>Hoskins's letters between 1947 and 1951 glitter with zest for new projects in local history, some of which foundered, some of which flourished. Out of all this emerged his history of <span class="italic">Devon</span> (1954), for which he visited all 450 parishes in the county, travelling by bus, train or on foot, positively relishing the &#145;feast of solitude&#146;. He never learned to drive a car, though he used one later, driven by his wife. The Victoria county history of Leicestershire was restarted through his efforts and he became for a while the editor, though his attempt to restart the Victoria county history of Devon failed, as did the plan to found a record society for Leicestershire.<br>
<br>Hoskins remained the single member of his college department until an enquiry by the Clapham committee into the future of economic and social history resulted in money being allocated to promote research, and through G. D. H. Cole's prodding he was encouraged to apply for a grant to his department. Knowing the relatively unexploited richness of Lincolnshire archives, he applied this money to set up a research fellowship for the study of Lincolnshire agrarian history, to which Joan Thirsk was appointed in 1951. But before she took up the post, Hoskins's growing reputation in the academic world had resulted in an invitation to take up the readership in economic history at Oxford University. He accepted, and although in the event the Oxford history syllabus had no room to accommodate local history, he gained wider renown for his radio broadcasts and his membership (with Dudley Stamp) of the royal commission on common land (1955&#150;8), and graduate students who were inspired by his teaching and chose research subjects under his influence congregated around him. The access to libraries and time for research were Oxford privileges which enabled Hoskins to write many articles and books between 1951 and 1965. One of these was <span class="italic">The Midland Peasant</span> (1957), a work of high scholarship and an influential model of an academic village history. It traced economic and social changes in the Leicestershire village of Wigston Magna, from the Anglo-Saxon period until 1900, when Wigston supported far more people, but &#145;a whole culture, a qualitative civilisation, had perished to bring about this quantitative triumph&#146;  (W. G. Hoskins, <span class="italic">The Midland Peasant</span>, 1957, 282). More conspicuously successful with the general reader was <span class="italic">The Making of the English Landscape</span> (1955), offering a historical account and explanation for the man-made features of the English countryside. Readers learned how to ask questions and search for answers about familiar local scenes; to many it opened new worlds.<br>
<br>Work in the civil service had emboldened a quiet, reserved person into one who wrote more rapidly, and revealed some strong prejudices against trends in the modern world. Hoskins's writing became lively, colourful, sometimes poetic, and always friendly towards the common reader. His lecturing style similarly inspired the imagination of his hearers, and still warmer responses came from those who heard his radio talks for the BBC after he had moved to Oxfordshire, and in the 1970s when he gave two series of television programmes, showing sites of historic significance while standing out in all weathers, rubicund, benign, usually smiling, though he was once ankle deep in river water.<br>
<br>Hoskins's unease at Oxford mounted in the 1960s; he saw it as a privileged place; he was not offered a college fellowship but was a guest only at All Souls College. In 1965 he returned to Leicester University as Hatton professor of English history, devised a one-year MA course in local history, but resigned in 1968 &#145;in despair&#146;  (<span class="italic">WW</span>), unwilling to submit to administrative burdens that impeded research. He lived until his death in Devon, first in Exeter, then Stoke Canon, and finally in Cullompton.<br>
<br>Hoskins married on 4 February 1933 Frances Ethel Jackson of Leicester, always known as Jane; they had a son, William Dommett (1935&#150;1987) and daughter Susan Mary (<i>b</i>. 1944). Jane was patient and self-effacing, and catered for Hoskins's growing indulgence in good food and wine; she enabled him, on his own admission, &#145;to live and work in Victorian comfort&#146;  (dedication to the <span class="roman">Shell Guide to Leicestershire</span>, 1970). Hoskins had moved from Oxfordshire to Exeter in 1955 and in 1963, in alliance with the new Civic Society, of which he was a founder member, he battled against a redevelopment of its Guildhall area. Incautious criticisms of the city's planning committee resulted in a libel suit which he settled out of court, to his cost. He was an acknowledged authority on historic buildings, gave much advice to Devon county council, and saved many threatened buildings from destruction.<br>
<br>Hoskins was elected fellow of the British Academy in 1969, was appointed CBE in 1971 &#145;for his services to local history&#146;, and received in his honour a Festschrift in 1974, which gives a full bibliography of his writings; in this year too he was awarded an honorary DLitt by Exeter University. He enjoyed an active, contented retirement for some years, but from 1979 minor strokes changed his personality, leaving him irascible and often melancholy. His interest in local history ceased and he turned to reading the classics of English literature and books on modern politics that provoked his familiar humorous grin, and witty and wickedly acerbic comments. He died of pneumonia at the Old Vicarage Nursing Home at Cullompton, Devon, on 11 January 1992. For reasons unknown to his family, he asked for his ashes to be scattered at Brampford Speke, and his wish was carried out, on 5 February 1992; George Gissing had described it as &#145;the most perfect village I ever saw&#146;. His wife died three months later on 14 April 1992.<br>
<br>Hoskins was no international traveller, preferring to explore England, loving Devon, and best of all Exeter; he often cited Horace's lines in relation to Exeter&#151;&#145;it is that corner of the world above all which has a smile for me&#146;. But his studies ranged widely within England, and by capturing a wide audience through his attractive writing, and by deepening public understanding of its historic landscapes, he contributed immeasurably to current knowledge and concern to conserve the environment.<br>
