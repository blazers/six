<span class="headword">Sharpeigh,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">merchant and sea captain</span>, from Biddenden, Kent, was in 1608 and 1609 the commander of the East India Company's fourth voyage to Aden, Surat, and Bantam. In his youth he served as an apprentice to a member of the Levant Company and was, in that capacity, a factor in Constantinople. It is known from his will that he then became the captain of a merchant ship, the <i>Adventure</i>, and accrued capital of at least &pound;500 trading in the Mediterranean for, among other commodities, grogram yarn and Venetian glass.<br>
<br>The chief aim of the fourth voyage was to establish trade with Aden and Surat. Fifty-six subscribers between them invested &pound;33,000 in shares each worth &pound;550 (parts of which might in turn be privately sold to under-subscribers). Of this capital the company spent nearly &pound;1750 on purchasing two ships, the <i>Ascension</i> and <i>Union</i>, &pound;14,600 on operating costs such as victuals and wages, &pound;3400 on goods such as cloth, iron, and tin, and &pound;15,000 in specie, chiefly Spanish reales. Sharpeigh himself bought one share in the voyage, and sold a quarter of this share to Sir Henry Lello and a quarter to a merchant, Stephen Harvey. To further his own trading prospects on the voyage Sharpeigh carried with him &pound;100 worth of specie, and other commodities such as tobacco and gilded ornaments in partnership with other merchants. Whatever hopes the subscribers and Sharpeigh himself may have had for the voyage, the amount they recovered was to be no greater than 3 shillings and 6 pence in the pound, or 17.5 per cent of the original investment. Shipwrecks of both ships were to claim most of the capital the investors subscribed.<br>
<br>Sharpeigh, in command of the <i>Ascension</i> and <i>Union</i>, departed in April 1608 but misfortune beset the voyage, on more than one occasion caused by bad judgement. A day after setting sail from the Cape of Good Hope, a storm caused the ships to be separated. Proceeding to Aden in the <i>Ascension</i>, in April 1609 Sharpeigh handled negotiations with the Ottoman beylerbeyi with prudent caution, trading a few goods in a spirit of mutual mistrust. Unable to establish a factory, he then sailed for Surat. In September he reached landfall at Mahuwa, where local mariners warned him of the dangerous shoals in the Gulf of Cambay. The master of the ship, Philip de Grave, according to John Jourdain  (114), &#145;stormed very much that he had brought the ship so far and now must have a pilot to carry him 20 leagues&#146;. Sharpeigh deferred to Grave, and on the approach to Surat, without a pilot, the <i>Ascension</i> ran aground. The crew made a landing near Surat, but the goods were lost.<br>
<br>The fate of shipwreck was also to befall the <i>Union</i>, under the captaincy of Richard Rowles. Not finding Sharpeigh at Madagascar or Socotra, Rowles sailed for Bantam, where he traded for spices. Members of the crew successively succumbed to illness, however, and on the return voyage to England, only four weakened survivors remained when the ship drifted uncontrolled onto the coast of Brittany. The 25,000 reales left behind at Bantam, and invested for subsequent ladings to England, was the only capital which yielded a return for subscribers to the fourth voyage.<br>
<br>Sharpeigh spent the next three years accompanying Sir William Hawkins and Sir Henry Middleton. Denied entry into Surat by the governor (a position encouraged by the Portuguese), Sharpeigh and his crew joined Hawkins at Agra and the court of the Mughal emperor, Jahangir (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1627); he spent upwards of twenty months there. Reports that the sixth voyage under the command of Middleton would be arriving soon and anxiety about the weakening position of the English at the Mughal court prompted Sharpeigh in July 1611 to meet the fleet near Surat. According to Nicholas Downton, Middleton came to rely on Sharpeigh almost exclusively for advice. When they sailed to Bantam, however, Middleton was unsuccessful in his bid to secure the position of chief merchant of the factory for Sharpeigh, who, instead of remaining with Middleton or holding a lesser position, in December 1612 led an expedition to Sukadana in south-western Borneo, known for its diamond mines. Soon thereafter Sharpeigh disappeared, and he died either in Batavia or on the second leg of the voyage.<br>
<br>Sharpeigh's will was proved on 11 June 1620, seven years after his family received letters informing them of his disappearance. John Eldred, the well-known traveller and merchant, was to oversee any commercial transactions that needed to be completed. Sharpeigh made several small bequests to his mother, his sisters, and their children, the remainder to be divided between his brothers, John and Richard. Five merchants were to divide his much devalued East India Company stock. Sharpeigh did not marry but was enamoured of Ruth Percy (<i>d</i>. 1608) of Plymouth, leaving her &pound;30 for &#145;the interchangeable love and entire affection between us&#146;. He also made a charitable bequest to the poor of Biddenden, Kent.<br>
