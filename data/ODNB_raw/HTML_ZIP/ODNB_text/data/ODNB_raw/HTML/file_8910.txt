<span class="headword">&AElig;thelheard <span class="st"> [Ethelhard]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 805), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was abbot of Louth in Lindsey before his elevation to the archbishopric of Canterbury on the death of J&aelig;nberht on 12 August 792. Nothing is known of his antecedents, but he can be assumed to be of Mercian extraction. He certainly owed his appointment to Offa, king of the Mercians, who had previously persuaded the papacy to divide J&aelig;nberht's province of Canterbury and elevate the Mercian see of Lichfield to an archbishopric. &AElig;thelheard thus received only the Kentish, West Saxon, and South Saxon bishoprics, while those of the Mercians and East Angles remained in the hands of Hygeberht of Lichfield. &AElig;thelheard was consecrated by Hygeberht on 21 July 793, and during the lifetime of Offa (and for a while afterwards) attested royal charters in a subordinate position to him, following the custom of distinguishing seniority between equals in rank by the date of consecration.<br>
<br>On Offa's death in 796, the Kentishmen rose in rebellion against Mercian dominance. They were led by Eadberht Pr&aelig;n, an exile in Offa's reign, who now became king. &AElig;thelheard, as a Mercian and an adherent of Offa, was presumably unacceptable to the new regime, and fled to the protection of Offa's son and successor, Ecgfrith, who gave him a minster at &#145;Pectanege&#146; (possibly Patney, Wiltshire) as a residence  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1258). In 797 Alcuin wrote to the Kentish people, urging them to recall their archbishop and warning against any attempt to replace him. He also wrote to &AElig;thelheard personally, censuring him for abandoning his see, but recognizing that it was the archbishop's own clergy who counselled flight. Whether &AElig;thelheard felt physically threatened by the new Kentish regime is uncertain, but it is possible that the episcopal church was attacked and damaged during his absence; no archives have survived from the period before 798, though there is plentiful documentation thereafter.<br>
<br>Ecgfrith himself died on 16 December 796, to be succeeded by a distant kinsman, Cenwulf. The new king opened negotiations with the papacy for the reunification of the southern province, but the difficulties were multiplied by the continuing hostility of the Kentishmen to Mercian overlordship. It was perhaps to counter this that Cenwulf attempted to have the archiepiscopal see moved from Canterbury to London, then a Mercian city; the see was vacant after the departure of Bishop Eadbald, who had fled abroad, for reasons which are now irrecoverable, in 796. Two missions were sent to Pope Leo III, one in 797, which miscarried, and another in 798. Pope Leo refused to countenance the removal of the archiepiscopal see from Canterbury, but did excommunicate Eadberht Pr&aelig;n, and within the year Cenwulf's forces overran Kent, captured and mutilated Eadberht, and restored &AElig;thelheard to Canterbury.<br>
<br>The problem of the archbishopric of Lichfield remained. The objection had always been to the division of the southern province, not to Hygeberht personally. Alcuin, in his letter to &AElig;thelheard cited above, urged restoration of &#145;the unity of the Church&#146;, but recommended that Hygeberht should retain his pallium for life as a personal dignity, while relinquishing the right to ordain bishops. This compromise seems to have been implemented in the late 790s; Hygeberht retained his archiepiscopal title until at least 799  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 155) but it was &AElig;thelheard who received professions of obedience from Eadwulf of Lindsey and Tidferth of &#145;Domnoc&#146; in 799, Deneberht of Worcester between 798 and 800, and Wulfheard of Hereford in 801.<br>
<br>In 801 &AElig;thelheard himself journeyed to Rome, accompanied by Cyneberht, bishop of Winchester, and two laymen, the Mercian thegn Ceolmund, formerly in the service of King Offa, and the Northumbrian Torhtmund, who had served the murdered King &AElig;thelred. He was helped on his way by Alcuin, who sent him a saddle horse and wrote to Charlemagne on his behalf. &AElig;thelheard delivered further letters from his king to the pope, and, on 18 January 802, received a papal letter permitting the restoration of the southern province. The separation was ended at the Council of &#145;Clofesho&#146; on 12 October 803  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1431a). Hygeberht had already resigned both his title and his see: Ealdwulf, his successor as bishop of Lichfield, was already in office in 800 or 801  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 106, 158) and Hygeberht attests the &#145;Clofesho&#146; decrees as a simple abbot, in the following of Bishop Ealdwulf  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1431b).<br>
<br>Despite the problems he faced, &AElig;thelheard's episcopate saw a greater frequency of synodal councils than those of his immediate predecessors. At least eleven synods are recorded for his time: at &#145;Clofesho&#146; in 792, at Chelsea in 793, at &#145;Clofesho&#146; again in 794, at London in 795, at Chelsea again in 796, at &#145;Clofesho&#146; in 798, at Tamworth in 799, at Chelsea yet again in 800 and 801, at &#145;Clofesho&#146; in 803, and at &#145;Aclea&#146; in 804. In addition to these, there may have been a synod at Bath in 796. In the earlier synods, Hygeberht and &AElig;thelheard seem to have presided jointly  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 136, 137, 139). It is possible that &AElig;thelheard presided alone at London in 795 and Chelsea in 796, but the texts of the diplomas which record these meetings are later and may have been emended after the abolition of the archbishopric of Lichfield  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 132, 150, 151). Both archbishops were present at &#145;Clofesho&#146; in 798 and at Tamworth in 799  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 153, 155); the charter recording the latter is Hygeberht's last attestation as archbishop. Both men attest a charter from the Synod of Chelsea in 801  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 158), but Hygeberht, though his name appears first, is styled only &#145;bishop&#146; (<i>episcopus</i>). The frequency of synodal meetings is presumably connected with the contemporary movement for reform of the church; that of 792 saw the issue of Offa's privilege to the Kentish churches  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 134), while the council of 803 prohibited the election of laymen or seculars as lords of monasteries  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1431b).<br>
<br>&AElig;thelheard's closeness to Offa is demonstrated by the letter from Charlemagne addressed to him and to Bishop Ceolwulf of Lindsey, asking them to intercede with the Mercian king on behalf of some Mercian exiles in Francia who wished to return home. The king's favour did not, however, extend to returning the minster of Cookham, in what is now Berkshire, given to Christ Church by Offa's predecessor, King &AElig;thelbald, but seized first by Cynewulf of Wessex and subsequently by Offa himself  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1258). It was not until the synod at &#145;Clofesho&#146; in 798 that &AElig;thelheard finally came to an agreement with Offa's widow, Cynethryth: she kept Cookham, and received in addition the minster at &#145;Pectanege&#146; given to &AElig;thelheard by her son Ecgfrith, but in return she granted the archbishop 110 hides (sulungs) of land in Kent, at North Fleet, Teynham, and &#145;the source of the Cray&#146;. In 799 &AElig;thelheard made an even better deal with King Cenwulf  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 155, 1259), recovering the church's estates at Charing, Great Chart, and Bishopsbourne, jointly assessed at 44 sulungs of land, for no more than 100 mancuses (&pound;12 10<i>s</i>.). In all, &AElig;thelheard appears as an effective and energetic archbishop, concerned both to preserve the integrity and endowment of his see and to ensure the health and discipline of the English church. He died on 12 May 805 and was buried at Christ Church, Canterbury; his successor was his archdeacon Wulfred.<br>
