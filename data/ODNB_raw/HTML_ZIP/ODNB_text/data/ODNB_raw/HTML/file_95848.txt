<span class="headword">Keatley,  Patrick Crawford</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on 28 October 1920, the son of William Mahaffy Keatley, and his wife, Hilda Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sinclair. His parents were from Northern Ireland. His father, a schoolteacher, was visiting Canada when the First World War broke out and fought throughout with the Canadians in Europe before returning to Canada. His mother taught gymnastics. Keatley remained a Canadian citizen throughout his life.<br>
<br>Keatley was educated at Upper Canada College in Toronto and then took a degree in history and English at the University of British Columbia. He developed an interest in the Commonwealth from one of his lecturers, the English constitutional lawyer Ivor Jennings, who held a visiting professorship at the University of British Columbia in 1938&#150;9. After graduating Keatley worked for the <span class="italic">Vancouver Sun</span> and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Then, in 1952, he went to Britain as a Commonwealth Press Union fellow. The experience transformed his life. He was attached to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and scored early journalistic fame with a story on the trade in live horses shipped from Britain for slaughter in mainland Europe. He disguised himself as an American meat trader, strapped a camera to his leg, and travelled with the animals. His articles were reprinted as a pamphlet. The prime minister, Winston Churchill, summoned him to his presence and said: &#145;You have caused me a lot of trouble, young man&#146;  (private information). He returned briefly to the <span class="italic">Vancouver Sun</span>, but soon went back to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, which posted him to London. On 10 September 1955, at Chelsea Old Church, he married (Prudence) Eve Burgess, a 23-year-old BBC producer and later press secretary to the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. She was the daughter of Henry Burgess, manufacturer. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Keatley served for more than thirty years as Commonwealth correspondent, then diplomatic correspondent, of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. All the time he remained a regular broadcaster. He was never lost for words, and his work for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, continued over forty years, soon led him to become a favourite with the BBC World Service. He took part almost daily in one programme or another, gave a weekly Commonwealth commentary on the World Service, and for thirty years broadcast for Canadian radio a newsletter about Britain.<br>
<br>Keatley began his career in London at a time when independence movements were gathering pace and the empire was transforming itself into the Commonwealth. Events in southern Africa&#151;the front line in the struggle for black rule&#151;occupied the front pages almost daily. Keatley was not just an astute reporter of the diplomatic developments in London; he covered the fast moving changes on the spot. The dominance in the 1960s of African coverage meant that he came to know especially well liberation leaders like Julius Nyerere, Kenneth Kaunda, and Joshua Nkomo, as well as British ministers involved, including Iain Macleod, David Owen, Alan Lennox-Boyd, and Sir Alec Douglas-Home. He made a special study of the unfolding fiasco of the Central African Federation and in 1963 produced what became a standard book on it, <span class="italic">The Politics of Partnership</span>.<br>
<br>In early 1965, a few months after China had conducted its first nuclear weapons test, Keatley caused a stir by writing about the possibility of India's becoming a nuclear power. He described the growing anxieties in key ministries in the Pakistan government, whose foreign minister was then Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He quoted Bhutto as saying that if India got the bomb then Pakistan would have to get, or buy, one, &#145;even if we have to eat grass&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 11 March 1965). These were tense times. In August&#150;September that year India and Pakistan were at war. Sometimes the danger was more personal. In the 1970s on a visit to Uganda during Idi Amin's rule Keatley stood in a crowd listening to a police band concert when the president spotted him, seized the conductor's baton, and announced: &#145;My friend Patrick will do the next number.&#146; Keatley pretended a coughing fit and managed to slip away. Later that day the queen's counsel who led the Uganda bar advised him to leave the country at once.<br>
<br>Keatley was a likeable and always chatty man, finding it easy to connect with people of every station. He was inquisitive, as becomes a good journalist, and engaged with prime ministers and heads of state as matter-of-factly as with junior ministers, MPs, and diplomats. Punctuality was not his strong point. He was rarely on time for an appointment. Radio producers, interviewers, and news editors often came near to despair. He would appear before them moments before he was due on air or deliver his copy for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> right up against the deadline. He was even late for appointments with cabinet ministers. No one knew how he got away with it, but he always did.<br>
<br>Keatley was hugely energetic and throughout his career was also an activist in helping fellow journalists. More than that, he was profoundly interested in raising their professional competence and status. He was a founder and first president of the Diplomatic and Commonwealth Writers Association in 1960, and co-founder of the Commonwealth Journalists Association and the Zambia Society. In London he was a wise and committed member of the Royal Commonwealth Society's library committee, offering much support to its librarians. He also served on the society's central council for several years. He was an eager attender and speaker at academic conferences until near the end of his life. He retired from <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> in 1985 and in 1996 moved with his wife to Somerset. He died on 9 May 2005 at his home, Manor Farm House, Lower Street, West Chinnock, Somerset, of fibrosing alveolitis and was buried on the 17th at West Chinnock. He was survived by his wife, Eve, and two of their children, Mark and Charlotte, his younger daughter, Victoria, having predeceased him.<br>
