<span class="headword">Davies,  Herbert</span>  (1818&#150;1885), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7267/', "Thomas Davies (1792&#150;1839)")</script>, a physician, was born in London on 30 September 1818. After education at North End House School, Hampstead, in 1836 Davies entered the London Hospital where his father was assistant physician. He matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1838, was a scholar in 1839&#150;40, but migrated to Queens' College on 6 March 1840 and graduated BA as thirty-first wrangler in 1842. He took the degree of MB in 1843, was elected a fellow of Queens' College in 1844, and graduated MD in 1848, his thesis being &#145;On the origin of gout&#146;. During these years he also studied medicine at Paris and Vienna as well as in London, and on 5 August 1845 he was elected assistant physician to the London Hospital. In 1850 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1854 he became full physician to the London Hospital, an office which he held for twenty years. He lectured in the medical school of that hospital, first on materia medica and afterwards on medicine; in addition he was examiner for medical degrees and assessor to the regius professor of physic at Cambridge University.<br>
<br>Davies married Caroline Templar, daughter of John Wyatt, on 24 August 1850. They had three sons and four daughters. Their second son, A. T. Davies, also became a physician. Davies lived in Finsbury Square, London, was physician to the Bank of England, and had a considerable practice in the City. His practice among the Jewish community was so large that he was nicknamed &#145;the king of the Jews&#146;  (Clark-Kennedy, 31). He also acted as physician to the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, and to the National Assurance Society. His research included observations on the relative magnitude of the areas of the four orifices of the heart, and he advocated the application of blisters to the swollen joints in acute rheumatism.<br>
<br>Besides several papers in the <span class="italic">London Hospital Reports</span> and in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Pathological Society</span>, Davies published a manual entitled <span class="italic">Lectures on the Physical Diagnosis of the Diseases of the Lungs and Heart</span> (1851), which reached a second edition in 1854 and was translated into German and Dutch; and <span class="italic">On the Treatment of Rheumatic Fever in its Acute Stage, Exclusively by Free Blistering</span> (1864). His papers on the form and areas of the heart's orifices were published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> in 1870 and 1872.<br>
<br>Davies died at his address at Vale Mount, Hampstead, London, on 4 January 1885, and was buried in Hampstead cemetery. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
