<span class="headword">Page,  (Montague) Russell</span>  (1906&#150;1985), <span class="occ">garden designer and landscape architect</span>, was born on 1 November 1906 at Kirkstead House, Kirkstead Road, Tattershall, Lincolnshire, the second son and middle child of the three children of Harold Ethelbert Page (1876&#150;1966), solicitor in Lincoln, and his wife, Ida Flora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin (1875&#150;1963). During three years of boarding at Charterhouse, Surrey&#151;where his uncle, Thomas Ethelbert Page, was on the governing body&#151;he showed no particular distinction in sports or academic subjects except English, but excelled in art. From the age of fourteen, after buying a <i>campanula pulla</i> at a local agricultural show, he spent his holidays in Lincolnshire making rock gardens, reading about them, and spending pocket money on plants. At seventeen he was accepting commissions to design and build rock gardens and learning from those who shared his passion. He also started visiting gardens, including those of Mark Fenwick at Abbotswood, Stow-on-the-Wold, Lawrence Johnstone at Hidcote Manor, and Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead, Surrey; Jekyll's writings, especially on colour, were a major influence.<br>
<br>After studying fine art at the Slade School in London (1923&#150;5) he spent most of the next three years in Paris studying painting, travelling, and working on various gardens. It was a formative period in his career. He met Andr&eacute; de Vilmorin, the son of a family of horticulturists and seed merchants in Paris, who became a lifelong friend. He also met the Americans Ogden Codman, a retired architect with an extensive photographic library of French ch&acirc;teaux, and Amos Laurence, who owned a ch&acirc;teau at Boussy St Antoine, south-east of Paris, and a fine library of old garden books. On his return to Britain he started gardening professionally early in 1929, gaining experience at Exton Park and North Luffenham Hall, Rutland; Longleat Park, Wiltshire, where he worked with Viscount Weymouth, simplifying the much landscaped grounds and revising the planting of the deer park and drive; and Greenways in Warminster. He also undertook work for the Mildmay family at Flete House, south Devon. He spent the summer of 1932 at Boussy St Antoine, where he started drawing garden plans. His rigorous self-discipline of making sketches of objects which he came across was &#145;not so much to accumulate a formal documentation, as to train my eye and mind to look and register more carefully&#146;  (Page, 24).<br>
<br>In London later in 1932 Page worked briefly for Richard Sudell, one of the founders of the recently formed Institute of Landscape Architects, designing plantings for the blocks of inexpensive flats being built in the London suburbs. A further commission from the Longleat estate rescued him from these tasks, as Viscount Weymouth sought a design for a museum and restaurant at Cheddar Gorge. Page needed architectural expertise and approached Geoffrey Jellicoe, who proved an enthusiastic collaborator. The project was successful; they both enjoyed the stimulus of developing ideas together and they attracted other important clients including Ronald Tree at Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire, the duke of York at the Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, and Gordon Russell at Broadway, Worcestershire. In 1937 he was elected a fellow of the Institute of Landscape Architects, to whose journal, <span class="italic">Landscape and Garden</span>, Sudell had enlisted him as a frequent contributor.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Page was attached to the political warfare executive, working with the BBC in setting up various foreign language services, and in propaganda, travelling and working mainly in Cairo, but also in the United States and Ceylon. After the war a chance meeting with the exiled Austrian artist Oskar Kokoschka gently guided him back into the discipline of observing, drawing, and painting. He decided to return to Paris to become a disciple of the philosopher and mystic George Gurdjieff, and in 1947 he married Gurdjieff's niece Lida at St Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, Paris. In Paris he met up again with Vilmorin and St&eacute;phane Boudin, a French interior designer whom Page had known from Ditchley Park and whose work he admired. They provided him with office space and commissions in France. On the recommendation of the Institute of Landscape Architects he was commissioned by the British Council to design new and existing parks and gardens for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Abadan.<br>
<br>While Page was developing work overseas, attention in Britain was focused on preparations for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Frank Clark was given overall responsibility for the landscape on the South Bank section, but Hugh Casson said that the Festival Gardens at Battersea Park needed &#145;something fairly chichi&#146;  (private information). Clark, who recalled working with Page (and Jellicoe) before the war, recommended him for the Festival Gardens. Page was appointed with sole responsibility for landscape and worked closely and successfully developing the site plan with the chief designer, James Gardener. Budgets had been halved, work was eighteen months delayed, and the site was subject to tidal flooding, but Page demonstrated that he could harness his skills to create the right effects and was not perturbed by the scale of operations. He mass-planted semi-mature shrubs: rhododendrons were hand-picked from the Exbury estate, and were fronted with 10,000 hostas, sourced from nurseries and private gardens throughout Europe. For &#145;frivolous planting&#146; in free-flowing beds between the pavilions he employed every available device &#145;so that texture, colour, size and shape would combine to make all the flower plantings sparkle, shimmer and seem to move in contrast to the bright, flat and static surfaces of paint&#146;  (Page, 327). He relied greatly on the experienced and unflappable E. R. Janes, formerly of Suttons, the Reading seedsmen, who was responsible for collecting and raising all the plants. Page was honoured for this work by appointment OBE in January 1952, the first British landscape architect to receive this award.<br>
<br>Moving back to his office at Vilmorin's in Paris, Page built up a prestigious client base including the duke and duchess of Windsor, William and Suzanna Walton on Ischia, and Giovanni Agnelli of Fiat. An array of challenging projects in France, Switzerland, Belgium, and Italy developed and refined his ideas on colour, water, and the interplay of objects in space. He designed the area adjacent to the French pavilion at the International Exhibition at Brussels in 1958, and in the same year he won a gold medal at the Chelsea flower show for his French garden. In 1959 he designed Vilmorin's garden at the Paris <i>floralies</i>, for which he won the grand prix d'honneur. His marriage was dissolved in 1954 and, on 30 December 1954, he married Vera Milanova Daumal (<i>d</i>. 1962), a widow, who encouraged him in writing a book to elucidate his approach to garden design.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Education of a Gardener</span> appeared in 1962, the year of his return to London, and was extremely well received. Perceptive and clearly written, it is an accumulation of sound wisdom offering relevant and timeless design principles. A particular &#145;hobby horse&#146; of his, as he had earlier put it, was &#145;real understanding of scale&#146;: &#145;once arrived at all the rest can fall into its place&#146;  (Landscape Institute, Page membership file). Over the last twenty-three years of his life he devoted his attention to larger projects, with commissions mostly in mainland Europe, but also significant public and corporate projects in the United States&#151;the courtyard of the Frick Collection in New York, the sculpture garden at the Columbus Museum of Art, the Donald M. Kendall sculpture gardens at PepsiCo world headquarters, and the Temple of Flora at the National Arboretum, Washington. In Britain he worked at Howletts and Port Lympne, and Leeds Castle in Kent; Badminton, Gloucestershire; and the Victoria and Albert Museum garden, also assisting Roy Strong with the museum's &#145;Garden&#146; exhibition in 1978. He was awarded the medal of the French Acad&eacute;mie d'Architecture in 1977. Lady Walton received the Italian Torsanlorenzo prestige prize in 2007 for implementing his design at La Mortella on Ischia. Page died at 10 Bryanston Square, Westminster, London, on 4 January 1985 and was buried in an unmarked grave in Badminton, Gloucestershire, on 11 January.<br>
<br>Page was constantly on the move between homes, jobs, and countries, and invariably worked on his own. Each composition represented his acute response to the dynamic medley between client, landscape, architecture, history, and location, so he would sometimes spend much time with his clients, getting to know them and walking the site. His aim was to produce for them &#145;gardens of aesthetic pleasure and emotional satisfaction&#146;, but remarkable clients are essential to the creation of remarkable gardens, and those were the ones he sought out. &#145;Russell had a larger than life character, even in appearance, he was very tall, bald with round blue eyes. He was awe-inspiring. His expression was the mirror of a very private character. He was reserved, basically shy, generous with others and frugal with himself&#146;  (Boyden and Vinciguerra). Except for expenses he invoiced clients once in the year and only after a job had been completed. Throughout his life he showed a consistent integrity towards his work, and was never swayed by money or celebrity.<br>
<br>The range of Page's work, often undertaken during periods of economic austerity, was remarkable. Most of his gardens were for private clients so few people will have experienced them first hand. A number have since been lost, or significantly modified (though the Battersea Festival Gardens were restored in 2004). No one trained under him, but through his writings and particularly his book&#151;which is much quoted and very quotable&#151;he gained many disciples. As a landscape architect, garden designer, and plantsman the quality of his thinking, in addition to his skills, placed him on a par with the best of his contemporaries.<br>
