<span class="headword">Bishop <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Riviere]</span>,  Anna</span>  (1810&#150;1884), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was the daughter of Daniel Valentine Riviere (1780&#150;1854), a drawing master of Huguenot descent, and his wife, Henrietta Thunder. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23695/', "William Riviere")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23694/', "Robert Riviere")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23693/', "Henry Parsons Riviere")</script>. were her brothers. She was born in London on 9 January 1810, and as a child she studied the piano with Ignaz Moscheles. In 1824 she entered the Royal Academy of Music, where she soon distinguished herself by her singing. She made her professional d&eacute;but at the Ancient Concerts on 20 April 1831, and on 9 July she married the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2470/', "Henry Rowley Bishop (1786&#150;1855)")</script>, who had formerly been her singing teacher. Her reputation quickly grew, and she took a prominent part in the concerts at Vauxhall, where her husband was music director, at the Lenten oratorios, and at provincial music festivals. Her repertory consisted of sacred music and English songs, but she was persuaded by Nicholas Bochsa, the harpist with whom she and her husband toured, to extend her performances to include Italian opera. In 1839, accompanied by Bochsa, but without her husband, she undertook a provincial tour which included Dublin and Edinburgh and ended in London in July. Four weeks after their return to London she abandoned her husband and three children, and eloped with Bochsa to Hamburg.<br>
<br>For the next four years Madame Bishop (as she was henceforth known) travelled widely on the continent with Bochsa, visiting all the principal towns outside France (where Bochsa, a bigamist and forger, was wanted by the authorities), including St Petersburg and Kazan, where they stayed during 1840&#150;41; during this period she sang at some 260 concerts. Between 1843 and 1846 she sang in about twenty operas at San Carlo, Naples. She was well received by her audiences, although Verdi remained unmoved.<br>
<br>In 1846 Madame Bishop and Bochsa returned to England, where she sang Isoline in Balfe's <span class="italic">The Lady of Artois</span> to critical acclaim. The following year they went to Dublin and on to New York, where on 12 July 1847 she appeared at a private reception held in her honour. They then undertook a lengthy tour encompassing Mexico, Cuba, and California, and returned to New York in 1850. On 1 November 1852 Madame Bishop produced and sang in the first American performance of Flotow's <span class="italic">Martha</span> at Niblo's Garden. In 1854 she was in California, and the following year in Sydney, Australia. Bochsa died there on 6 January 1856, and she went on to tour Chile, Argentina, and Brazil before returning to New York in 1858. There she married a diamond merchant, Martin Schultz, Sir Henry Bishop having died in 1855. She spent the 1858&#150;9 season in London, then embarked on another extensive tour of North and Central America. In 1866 she left California across the Pacific, but on 19 February the ship in which she was travelling was wrecked on a coral reef; she lost all her music, jewellery, and clothes in the wreck. After a month in a small boat she and her husband reached land, and, undaunted, she resumed her tour in Manila, proceeded to Hong Kong, Singapore, China, and India, and arrived in England by way of Australia. She returned to New York, and undertook another world tour between 1874 and 1876. She finally settled in New York, where she made her last public appearance on 22 April 1883, and where she died on 18 or 19 March 1884.<br>
<br>A woman of middle size, with large, lustrous eyes, Anna Bishop was one of the most popular English singers of the period. She had great technical mastery over her high soprano voice, but was a somewhat unsympathetic singer. A member of many musical societies around the world, she was extremely popular in the United States, and was one of the most widely travelled performers of the century.<br>
