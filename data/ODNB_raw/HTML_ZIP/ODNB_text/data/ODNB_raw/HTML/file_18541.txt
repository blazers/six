<span class="headword">Melvill, Sir  James Cosmo</span>  (1792&#150;1861), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born at Guernsey, the third son of Captain Philip Melvill (1760&#150;1811), afterwards lieutenant-governor of Pendennis Castle, Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth Carey (1770&#150;1845), youngest daughter of Peter Dobree of Beauregarde, Guernsey. Their fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18540/', "Henry Melvill")</script>, was principal of Haileybury College and canon of St Paul's. Their fourth son, Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Melvill, was military and naval secretary to the government of Bombay.<br>
<br>Melvill entered the home service of the East India Company as a clerk in February 1808. In March 1815 he married Hester Jane Frances (<i>d</i>. 1864), youngest daughter of William Marmaduke Sellon of Harlesden, Middlesex; they had nine children. In 1824 he was promoted to auditor of Indian accounts, in which capacity he appeared before several parliamentary committees. In 1834 he became financial secretary to the company and in 1836 chief secretary.<br>
<br>As chief secretary Melvill corresponded with many of the company's principal servants in India and with friends and critics alike of the company at home. Often, as at the time of Lord Ellenborough's recall, he was required to soften and deflect opposition to the company's more controversial decisions. His friendly diplomacy won over even the notoriously unforgiving critic of the company, Joseph Pease, the anti-slavery campaigner, who came to look upon him as a fellow fighter in the cause of humanity and a personal friend.<br>
<br>Politically, Melvill was a traditionalist, opposed to the territorial acquisitions of the 1840s and 1850s and keen to preserve the independence and prestige of India's remaining princes. In spite of his financial background, he did not hesitate to criticize acts of economy which he thought to be politically harmful. For example, he deplored as short-sighted the company's periodic bouts of military retrenchment, correctly observing that such cutbacks were generating a smouldering resentment among Indian soldiers and their families.<br>
<br>In 1853 Melvill was created KCB. In February 1858, after fifty years of service, he retired, although he continued for some months as <i>ex officio</i> government director of Indian Railways. He was the last chief secretary of the company. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1841 and became a commissioner of lieutenancy for the city of London in 1847.<br>
<br>Melvill died at his home, Tandridge Court, near Godstone in Surrey, on 23 July 1861. His widow survived him by three years. Their second son, James Cosmo (1821&#150;1880), followed his father into the home administration of British India and in 1859 was appointed assistant under-secretary of state for India.<br>
