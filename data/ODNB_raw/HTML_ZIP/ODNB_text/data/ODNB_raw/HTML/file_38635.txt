<span class="headword">Savage, Sir  George Henry</span>  (1842&#150;1921), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born at 65 Edward Street, Brighton, Sussex, on 12 November 1842, the son of William Dawson Savage, a chemist and druggist at Balham and then Brighton, and his wife, Elizabeth Wallace. Educated at private schools in Brighton and then at Brighton College, Savage attended chemistry classes and was apprenticed locally to a firm of doctors; he subsequently matriculated from London University with honours in botany. For the next two years he was a pupil at Sussex County Hospital, and studied medicine from 1861 at Guy's Hospital, London, where he won the treasurer's gold medal. He qualified MRCS in 1864, LRCP and MB (London) in 1865, and MD in 1867. After being appointed resident house surgeon at Guy's in 1865 he moved to general practice, working for four years as medical officer for a lead mining company at Nenthead, Alston, in Cumberland, often being required to ride 20 miles a day visiting his patients. It was here that he met his first wife, Margaret, daughter of Jacob Walton, of Alston Moor, who died of a pulmonary embolism little more than a year after their marriage on 9 September 1868; they had one child. Savage was appointed assistant medical officer to Bethlem Royal Hospital in 1872 under Rhys Williams. Succeeding to the post of physician superintendent in 1879, Savage served in that capacity until 1888, when he retired to take up private practice and was made a governor of the hospital. He took the MRCP in 1878, and was elected FRCP in 1885.<br>
<br>Savage's shift towards private practice was discernible by the 1880s, as he sought to reach a more popular market with his writings and began to be a frequent absentee from Bethlem, something that aroused criticism from his colleague J. C. Bucknill. As a private practitioner, Savage was not only one of the most fashionable but one of the first, among a number of leading Victorian specialists in mental diseases, to seek success outside the asylum and to develop a practice based on the consulting room. Savage also became consulting physician to several private asylums, including The Priory, Roehampton, and Chiswick House. As a private consultant he was also frequently consulted by the Home Office in difficult mental cases. Savage was additionally a lecturer on mental diseases at Guy's Hospital for thirty years. His straightforward, authoritative teaching at Bethlem and Guy's attracted students from all over the world. He was in demand too as a postgraduate teacher, especially for the London University MD degree, serving as an examiner in mental pathology. Throughout his career Savage was a supporter of medical education for women, providing both financial and moral backing. However, in his writings he supported the commonly held belief in the danger of over educating females of frailer nerves.<br>
<br>Savage also served for over twenty years as consulting physician to the Royal Institution for the Mentally Deficient, Earlswood, and was on its board of management. He was elected president of the Medico-Psychological Association (MPA) in 1886, giving a presidential address on insanity's relationship to bodily and functional disorders. He was an original member of the Neurological Society and was elected president in 1897, when he spoke on heredity and neurosis.<br>
<br>Savage jointly (with Daniel Hack Tuke and Thomas Clouston) edited the <span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span> from 1878 to 1894. He was a prolific writer, publishing over a hundred articles in this and other medical journals, capitalizing on the clinical material provided by his extensive hospital experience. While at Bethlem he had joined Klein's physiology classes and made the most of the hospital's rather limited pathological opportunities, making a number of contributions to the Neurological Society and to its journal, <span class="italic">Brain</span>. Despite devoting much attention to the central nervous system, Savage was essentially a clinician, and his contributions to psychiatry were supplemental rather than seminal. His publications covered a wide range of subjects, from catalepsy, epilepsy, puerperal insanity, the neuroses, and general paralysis of the insane, to the pathology of insanity and restraint. Early articles (1879 and 1881) on the administration of chloral and hyoscyamine are of note for their criticisms of excessive chemical restraint. Savage used sedation sparingly and mostly for violent and dangerous cases, although for deterrent as well as quietening purposes. Savage's relatively large scale use of mechanical restraint at Bethlem, on the other hand, aroused considerable controversy in the press and within the profession, drawing particular criticism from J. C. Bucknill. Savage's association with the pro-restraint lobby seems to have been one of the reasons that his relations became strained with Henry Maudsley too&#151;not a single article by Maudsley appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span> during Savage and Tuke's joint editorship. Savage also appears to have been quite positively disposed to the benefits of sexual surgery for insanity, giving early support to such surgery on a few cases at Bethlem, and later being one of a number of psychiatrists sympathetic towards sterilization for the mentally &#145;unfit&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1907 Savage gave the Lumleian lectures before the Royal College of Physicians, entitled &#145;The increase of insanity&#146;, on which Savage offered a traditional perspective, convinced that the increase was real and directly related to the progress of civilization. While he accepted that the transmission of insanity might lead to the extinction of the race, his preventive and eugenic concerns with controls over reproduction and immigration did not prevent him from being critical of alarmist contemporary theories. In 1909 he lectured at the college on experimental psychology and hypnotism as the Harveian orator for that year. His lecture offered a slightly more hopeful assessment of the likely benefits and medical uses of psychological observations and hypnotism than those given by many of his professional contemporaries.<br>
<br>Savage also published on forensic psychiatry, becoming known as an expert witness in insanity pleas, and extending his public profile by expounding on the Jack the Ripper case. His status as an authority on a variety of medico-psychological matters is underlined by the fact that he wrote twenty of the articles in Daniel Hack Tuke's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Psychological Medicine</span> (1892) and six in T. C. Allbutt's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (1896&#150;9). His publications also included a number of influential papers on the association of insanity with marriage, which showed that he was not prepared to go as far as some of his more eugenically minded colleagues in advocating state regulation of espousal and fertility. Savage's major single authored work was a textbook entitled <span class="italic">Insanity and Allied Neuroses</span> (1884), which was praised as being an accessible, standard reference book for students and junior practitioners, but was also criticized for its neglect of pathology; it went into a fourth revised edition in 1893 and was further enlarged in 1907. Savage moved further than most of his colleagues towards recognizing that general paralysis was the result of structural changes in the nervous system associated with syphilis. He also emphasized the influence of individuals' environment in determining their mental state, often seeing insanity as being as much to do with maladjustment to changing social and environmental factors as with organic disease and constitutional predisposition.<br>
<br>Savage was knighted in 1912, and in the same year was elected first president of the newly formed psychiatric section of the Royal Society of Medicine. He also took an active role in the management of the After-Care Association, acting as its treasurer until his death. He remained relatively active well into the twilight of his life, continuing to publish and deliver papers. During the First World War he served as a consultant to Knutsford's hospitals for officers and spoke before the MPA on wartime mental disabilities.<br>
<br>Savage's most famous private patient was the novelist Virginia Woolf, about whose mental problems he was intermittently consulted between 1904 and 1913, having long been both friend and physician to her family. Historical and literary scholarship on his treatment of Woolf has tended to pronounce negatively, censuring his espousal of a strict rest-cure regime as inappropriate and profoundly out of sympathy with Woolf's needs as a woman and a writer. Woolf was hostile from the outset to Savage's prescription and her family also gradually lost faith in his advice, the final straw being her attempted suicide at the very moment the family was explaining to Savage why they had called in a second opinion. Woolf exacted her revenge through her portrayal of him in her novel <span class="italic">Mrs Dalloway</span>, Savage serving as one of the models for the sinister and domineering society nerve specialist, Sir William Bradshaw. Yet despite Woolf's (and others') characterization of Savage as tyrannical and shortsighted, his prescriptions of rest, a ban on reading and writing, isolation from friends, simple regimen, confinement in a nursing home or in natural surroundings away from the city, and holidaying in the country and at the coast, were relatively mild and conventional fare for mentally and physically ill patients in late Victorian times.<br>
<br>Savage enjoyed a breadth of non-medical interests. He was an enthusiastic alpine climber, making a record ascent of the Matterhorn and being a member and one-time vice-president of the Alpine Club. He was also a keen cyclist, golfer, fisherman, gardener, and fencer, as well as an avid mineralogist and botanist, devoting much of his spare time to gathering and cataloguing a considerable collection of rock and flora samples. Well-connected socially, Savage took pains to become a prominent member of numerous gentlemen's social and recreational clubs and associations, from the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96363', "Sunday Tramps")</script>, to the Organon Club and the Casual Club. Savage had also joined and (for a time) presided over the Old Union Masonic Lodge, but abandoned masonry on his second marriage, on 3 May 1882, to Adelaide Mary Sutton (<i>b</i>. 1856/7), daughter of Henry Gawen Sutton, physician. Savage was seen by contemporaries as a candid, humorous, sociable, clubbable, vigorous bodied man; he was a great supporter of the physical and psychical virtues of exercise and sport. Suffering from progressive deafness and bodily debility later in life, he died after &#145;an attack of hemiplegia&#146; on 5 July 1921, at his home, 26 Devonshire Place, London. He was cremated and his ashes were interred at Sevenoaks. His second wife had died in the early 1900s. He left a son, Harold Savage, who was a medical practitioner in the Malay States, and a daughter, Mrs Droeser.<br>
