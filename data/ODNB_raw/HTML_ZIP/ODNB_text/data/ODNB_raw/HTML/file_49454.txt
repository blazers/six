<span class="headword">Clephan,  James</span>  (1804&#150;1888), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 17 March 1804 in Monkwearmouth, co. Durham, the second son and child of ten children born to Robert Clephan (1777?&#150;1857), a baker, and his wife, Elizabeth Bails (1780?&#150;1851). Robert Clephan had gone to England from Edinburgh and shortly after James's birth moved to Stockton-on-Tees, where his bakery, specializing in ship's biscuits, expanded into ship chandlery.<br>
<br>Robert and Elizabeth Clephan had belonged to the Church of Scotland, but in Stockton the family joined the Unitarian congregation meeting in the Presbyterian Chapel, High Street. Largely drawn from families of small tradesmen and working men, the congregation had declined from its once flourishing state and indeed was closed in 1817&#150;20 in a dispute with a minister who had returned to orthodoxy and refused to give up the chapel. The Unitarians nevertheless remained a lively force in the culture of Stockton, a place for which James Clephan retained an abiding affection.<br>
<br>Apprenticed to a Stockton printer, in 1825 Clephan sought work in Edinburgh, where his father's family could offer support and where he greatly improved his skill. He returned to Stockton in 1827 and in October 1828 became a journeyman printer for the <span class="italic">Leicester Journal</span>, serving also as sub-editor. He was active in the Unitarian congregation at Great Meeting and in the Leicester Mechanics' Institute. In 1838 he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Gateshead Observer</span>, a weekly of recent foundation, which he edited (being as well sub-editor and reporter) until his retirement in 1859. The <span class="italic">Observer</span> was already a lively and hard-hitting paper when Clephan joined it, but, in an age when newspapers borrowed heavily from each other, his incisive, witty, and quotable commentary brought it a national reputation. On his retirement his fellow journalists in the area presented him with a silver inkstand and a cheque for &pound;250.<br>
<br>On 16 July 1832 Clephan married Jane Pringle (<i>b</i>. 1801/2) of Stockton, who died on 10 March 1849; there were no children. After his retirement he returned to Stockton, but in 1861 was lured back into newspaper work, freelancing for the <span class="italic">Newcastle Daily Chronicle</span> and for the <span class="italic">Weekly Chronicle</span>, with which he maintained a connection after his second retirement in the mid-1870s. His essays for the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> newspapers drew on his deep literary and antiquarian knowledge and his memories of the social revolution&#151;from stagecoach to railway and from sail to steam&#151;through which he had lived. In his later years his friends received privately printed Christmas volumes made up of his essays and poems. A list of his separately published works appears at the end of the sketch in Richard Welford's <span class="italic">Men of Mark 'twixt Tyne and Tweed</span> (1895); two series of manuscript letters, which he transcribed and somewhat abridged and which were later deposited in the Northumberland Record Office, offer delightful glimpses into a closely knit family in a provincial town.<br>
<br>Clephan was a staunch Liberal and reformer. He steadily opposed capital punishment and was a strong advocate of sanitary reform, notably in a series of articles in the 1850s calling attention to three earlier visitations of cholera to Gateshead and reprinted in <span class="italic">The Three Warnings</span> (1854). He was a dedicated supporter of the Gateshead Mechanics' Institute and the Gateshead Dispensary, and of the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, the Newcastle Antiquarian Society, and the Unitarian congregation in Newcastle, meeting first in Hanover Square and later as the Church of the Divine Unity.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the 1880s Clephan withdrew from all journalistic work, except for occasional articles for the Unitarian <span class="italic">Christian Life</span>, and thereafter was largely confined by ill health to his room. He remained his charming, congenial self, however, until his death from bronchitis at his home, 9 Picton Place, Newcastle, on 25 February 1888; he was buried in Jesmond old cemetery in Newcastle on 28 February.<br>
