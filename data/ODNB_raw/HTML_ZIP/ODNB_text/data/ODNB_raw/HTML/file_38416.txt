<span class="headword">Chambers,  Walter</span>  (1824&#150;1893), <span class="occ">bishop of Labuan, Sarawak, and Singapore</span>, was born in England and ordained at Lichfield as deacon in 1849 and priest in 1850. He served briefly as curate of Bentley in Derbyshire, before joining the Borneo Church Mission in Kuching, Sarawak, in March 1851. Founded in 1846 the struggling mission was led by a Kuching-based missionary doctor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17468/', "Francis Thomas McDougall (1817&#150;1886)")</script>, but other missionaries and teachers soon left.<br>
<br>Recruited to convert the newly pacified sea Dyaks of the second division, Chambers spent six months under the instruction of McDougall, who admired his energy, enthusiasm, and religious zeal, but deplored his obstinacy, prejudice, and lack of ear for foreign languages. Impatient to start work Chambers opened the first rural mission at Sekrang in September 1851, barely four months after peacemaking ceremonies between the Dyaks and the Brooke regime. Finding the tribe stubbornly unreceptive, in 1853 he moved his headquarters to less hostile territory at Banting. Chambers took his first four converts for baptism in Kuching on Christmas day 1853, but progress was slow, against a background of continuing violence and unrest.<br>
<br>In 1855 McDougall, newly appointed first bishop of Labuan and Sarawak, brought two women missionaries, a schoolmaster, and another clergyman from England, but none settled. Meanwhile Chambers drove himself hard, neglecting his comfort and health. McDougall feared he was &#145;going native&#146; when he first saw him in Kuching, barefoot and shirtless, wearing a sarong and with a long unkempt beard, and looking &#145;more a pirate than a clergyman&#146;  (Saunders, 44). Mrs McDougall's formidable missionary cousin, Elizabeth Woolley (1814?&#150;1875), a surgeon's daughter, transformed his disordered life. Having paid her own passage she arrived in December 1856; two months later, when Chinese miners burned Kuching and murdered some of the raja's men, Elizabeth, showing great spirit and courage, took charge of the mission house. Arriving from Banting, Chambers was enchanted by her personality, religious zeal, and capacity to produce order and comfort out of devastation. Married in Kuching on 27 August 1857, they had no children and made an incongruous couple, more like mother and son: Elizabeth at forty-three, ten years Chambers's senior and looking older than her years, was gaunt, angular, and beanpole thin. Unkindly dubbed Mrs Proudie by other wives, she was fiercely devoted to her husband and his missionary enterprise, accompanying Chambers on arduous journeys, sometimes gravely ill and near starvation, but keeping their house spick and span. By 1861 the Brookes had brought relative peace to the second division, and gradually Chambers and his wife built up a successful mission station. Toiling to commit sea Dyak to writing, Chambers translated prayers, hymns, and the gospels of <span class="roman">Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">Mark</span>. In 1863 a Dyak warrior chief sought baptism and then took Christianity back to his tribe. For the first time Elizabeth also coaxed Dyak women and girls to the mission. By 1867 the school boasted fifty pupils, boys and girls, some of them boarders, and the church had to be enlarged.<br>
<br>But in Kuching relations had soured between church and state, Chambers loyally supporting his bishop. While in England in July 1868 McDougall resigned, recommending Chambers, whom he had appointed archdeacon of Sarawak in May that year, as his successor. Chambers was duly consecrated bishop of Labuan on 29 June 1869 and formally installed as bishop of Sarawak on 5 June 1870. Meanwhile in 1869 the Straits Settlements diocese had been transferred from Calcutta, and the new diocese of Labuan, Sarawak, and Singapore was formed. Chambers made St Andrew's in Singapore the cathedral church of the united diocese and he visited it every year, although he met the extra expense himself since the diocese only funded a biennial visit. However, the Dyaks remained his priority. Appointing a resident chaplain for Kuching, he continued active missionary travel. His relationship with the government was less troubled than his predecessor's but there were still tensions. Rani Margaret Brooke called him a great friend of her husband Charles, but he refused to bury their unchristened stillborn child in the family cemetery. Although Brooke had known him from their pioneering bachelor days in the turbulent second division and respected his work among the Dyaks, both were solitary people. Their friendship had cooled when Chambers married and had worsened when he supported McDougall. Chambers's first sermon as bishop, critical of European ways, provoked an angry exchange between the raja, who preferred discreet liaisons to marriage among his officers, and Elizabeth Chambers, who upheld the bishop's ecclesiastical authority.<br>
<br>Relations mellowed after 1875, when Elizabeth died, aged sixty-one, while on leave in England. After returning to Kuching in July 1876 Chambers continued his tireless journeys despite increasing arthritis, but lack of funds, a dearth of suitable recruits, and the failure to train an Asian priesthood doomed his efforts. Too understaffed to attend the Lambeth conference in 1878, Chambers collapsed in August that year and was dispatched immediately to England to recuperate. In November 1879, unable to return, he told the archbishop of Canterbury that a complete failure of health compelled him to relinquish his loved work and people, and he formally resigned early in 1881, once a successor had been found. A disabled invalid, he eventually died at his home in London, 27 Bedford Gardens, Kensington, after a painful, lingering illness, on 21 December 1893.<br>
