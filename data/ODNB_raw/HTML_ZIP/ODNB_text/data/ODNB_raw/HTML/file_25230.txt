<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Gregory</span>  (1713&#150;1771), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Yorkshire, the son of John Sharpe, solicitor to the Treasury, and his wife. He was educated at Hull grammar school, and later at Westminster School under Dr Robert Freind. At Westminster he committed some irregularity, and from the summer of 1731 he lived for four years at Aberdeen with the classical scholar Thomas Blackwell. During this time, he may have gained an MA from Aberdeen University. On 2 June 1735 he was admitted fellow commoner at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated LLB in 1738. He returned to Trinity College on 8 June 1747, and proceeded LLD. On 4 July 1751 he was incorporated at Oxford.<br>
<br>Sharpe was ordained deacon at Bristol in 1737, and priest at Westminster on 20 January 1739, and served for some time as minister of Broadway Chapel, Westminster. From 1743 to 1756 he was vicar of All Saints, Birling, near Maidstone. He became prebendary of Yetminster secunda in Salisbury Cathedral on 18 March 1757, and vicar of Purton, Wiltshire, in 1761; he held these posts until his death. Sharpe was chaplain to Frederick, prince of Wales, until 1751, and to George III from 1762 to 1771. He gave the fast-day sermons for 1757&#150;9, and gave charity sermons for the London Maternity Hospital for Married Women in 1759, Westminster Hospital in 1764, and the London Asylum for Orphan Girls in 1770. On the death of Samuel Nicolls in 1763 he was elected to the mastership of the Temple, where William Maxwell was his assistant.<br>
<br>In addition to his sermons Sharpe published widely on religious and classical subjects. He wrote several defences of Christianity, and his <span class="italic">Rise and Fall of the Holy City and Temple of Jerusalem</span> (1765) went into a second edition in 1766. He defended the rationalist philosophers Samuel Clarke and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz against Lewis Philip Thummig (1774), and in 1769 contributed a pamphlet to the debate about James Merrick's version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. He also published pieces in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. A posthumous collection of his sermons, edited by Joseph Robertson, appeared in 1772.<br>
<br>Sharpe took a scholarly interest in systems for learning languages. In 1751 he published <span class="italic">A dissertation upon the origin and structure of the Latin tongue, containing a rational and compendious method of learning Latin</span>, and in the same year brought out a second edition of his <span class="italic">Seven Letters Containing a New and Easy Method of Learning the Hebrew Language</span>. He also wrote about Greek, and his <span class="italic">Origin and Structure of the Greek Tongue</span> (1767) was reissued in 1777. He contributed the translation of Aristophanes' <span class="italic">Frogs</span> to Charlotte Lennox's 1759 edition of <span class="italic">The Greek Theatre of Father Brumoy</span>, and, with the fourth earl of Shaftesbury, he published in 1766 John Locke's <span class="italic">Observations upon the Growth and Culture of Vines and Olives</span>, from the original manuscript. In the same year he revised Benjamin Martyn's biography of the first earl of Shaftesbury, later edited by Andrew Kippis (1771) and published about 1790. In 1767 he collected and edited the dissertations of Thomas Hyde.<br>
<br>Sharpe was elected FRS on 9 May 1754 and was fellow and the director of the Society of Antiquaries when he died, at the master's house in the Temple, on 8 January 1771. He had collected an impressive library, which was sold on 8 April 1778 and over the next ten days. A catalogue was published, listing his fine collection of oriental manuscripts and many valuable prints and drawings in addition to his books, and the library sold for over &pound;577.<br>
