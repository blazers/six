<span class="headword">Lambe,  Walter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1476&#150;1504), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown origins. Nor is anything known for certain about his education; there is no compelling reason to concur with speculation that the composer may be identifiable with the boy of this name who, having been born in Salisbury in 1450 or 1451, was elected a king's scholar of Eton College on 8 July 1467. The composer first occurs during 1476&#150;7, as a lay clerk of the choir of Holy Trinity collegiate church, Arundel. On 5 January 1479 he was entered on the payroll, and on 13 February formally admitted, as a lay clerk of the choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor. During the autumn of 1479 he was appointed in addition to the office of master of the choristers, and he continued to occupy both posts until his departure between 1 October 1484 and 30 September 1485. In fact, he returned to Arundel, where he was once again a lay clerk during 1490&#150;91; eventually, however, he returned to his former lay clerkship at Windsor on 1 July 1492. The rationale behind this curious career pattern is not at all evident. He was not reappointed as master of the choristers, but continued in employment as a lay clerk at least until 30 September 1504; because of loss of documentation at Windsor, his career beyond that date cannot be traced, and his date of death is unknown.<br>
<br>Lambe's surviving compositions comprise one setting of the <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> and seven Marian votive antiphons. All this music is preserved in the Eton choirbook, compiled <i>c</i>.1502&#150;1505 for use by the choir of Eton College chapel[<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>]. A further four pieces, listed in the index, have been lost from the manuscript; indeed, only John Browne was represented by a greater number of compositions, and certainly Lambe's work was well known and widely circulated. The text of <span class="italic">Stella celi</span> is an invocation for deliverance from plague, and may have been written in the summer of 1479, when an outbreak assailed the staff of St George's; beyond this, no chronology for his work can be suggested. Lambe emerges as among the two or three most accomplished representatives of that generation of composers who brought to maturity the uniquely English manner of late fifteenth-century composition. He wrote with equal assurance both for ensembles of men's voices and for full choir in up to six parts; his work is extended in scale, virtuosic in the demands which it makes on its performers, and no less imaginative in melodic invention than in the sonorities drawn from his ensemble.<br>
