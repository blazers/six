</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beeching,  Richard</span>, Baron Beeching  (1913&#150;1985), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 21 April 1913 in Sheerness, Kent, the second of the four sons of Hubert Josiah Beeching, journalist, and his wife, Annie Twigg, schoolteacher. He was educated at Maidstone grammar school and at Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, where he was awarded a first-class degree in physics in 1934 and a PhD in 1937 for his research into electrons. He published <span class="italic">Electron Diffraction</span> (1936). In 1938 he married Ella Margaret, daughter of William John Tiley, engineer, of Maidstone. They had no children.<br>
<br>After a year's work at the fuel research station in Greenwich in 1936, Beeching was recruited by William Griffiths (1895&#150;1952) to work at the new research laboratory set up by the Mond Nickel Company Ltd in Birmingham, and in 1943 was seconded to the Ministry of Supply to work in the armaments design department, which dealt with the design and development of weapons and ammunition for all three services. He continued working there after the war as deputy chief engineer of armaments design from 1946 until he joined the technical department of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI) in London at the invitation of Sir Ewart Smith (1897&#150;1995), technical director of ICI, who had headed the armaments design department during the war. At ICI he worked on the development of man-made fibres as a member of the Terylene Council, which became the board of the ICI fibres division. As a vice-president of ICI of Canada Ltd from 1953, Beeching spent two years in charge of building a fibres plant at Millhaven, Ontario, and was appointed chairman of the metals division of ICI in 1955. He became technical director of ICI in 1957, with a seat on the board.<br>
<br>But it was as chairman of the British Railways board that Beeching became a national figure. He had been a member of the special advisory group on the British Transport Commission set up in 1960 by the minister of transport, Ernest Marples, under the chairmanship of Sir Ivan Stedeford, chairman of Tube Investments Ltd, which advised the government that the railways should be run as a business. Helped by the advice of the Stedeford group, the government published a white paper, <span class="italic">The Reorganization of the Nationalized Transport Undertakings</span>, in December 1960, proposing to break up the British Transport Commission, which presided over not only British Railways but also British Road Services, London Transport, British Transport Hotels, and Thomas Cook, and to put the railways under a British Railways board appointed by the minister of transport. General Sir Brian Robertson, chairman of the British Transport Commission since 1953, who saw the railways as a public service, was retired two years early, and Beeching was appointed in his place as chairman of the British Transport Commission and chairman-designate of the proposed British Railways board for a five-year period, with a salary of &pound;24,000 p.a. (equal to his existing ICI salary), far higher than that of any other head of a nationalized industry.<br>
<br>Beeching's brief was to modernize British Railways and turn it into a profitable business. By the time he was appointed, the modernization plan of 1955 was being implemented, including investment in diesel locomotives, and the House of Commons select committee on the nationalized industries had published its report in July 1960 concluding that the losses sustained by British Railways&#151;a &pound;42 million deficit in 1959&#151;were mainly due to the uneconomic passenger services. At the British Transport Commission's headquarters, Stanley Raymond, who was to be Beeching's successor as chairman of British Railways, had commissioned regional studies of the rail system to find out which lines were making a loss and which parts of the system were commercially viable. Beeching spent most of his first two years drafting the report <span class="italic">The Reshaping of British Railways</span> (1963), always known as the &#145;Beeching report&#146;. Although what he proposed was not new, he came to be identified in the public mind with the argument that British Railways should concentrate on those tasks for which the railways were best qualified. In his report he revealed that half of the 7000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic, one-third of the track carried only 1 per cent of the traffic, and only one-third of the stock of railway carriages was used all the year round. In the appendix he listed 2000 stations and 250 lines which he thought should be closed on economic grounds, with a reduction of 70,000 staff, and the term &#145;Beeching axe&#146; was coined by the press. Bitterly criticized at the time by the railway unions and large sections of the public, especially in communities which lost their branch lines, Beeching continued to be branded as the man who destroyed the railway system. Less publicity was given to the more positive aspects of the report, the development of those parts of the system which were economically viable, including liner trains, the forerunner of the Freightliner service. Beeching followed this with <span class="italic">The Development of the Major Trunk Routes</span> (1965), a survey of how rail traffic could be concentrated on the 3000 miles of main lines. He also completely reorganized the management structure of British Railways, bringing in businessmen to middle and senior management posts.<br>
<br>With the Labour victory in October 1964, Beeching's unpopularity led him to resign at the end of May 1965, one year earlier than intended. Appointed minister of transport in December 1965, Barbara Castle began to take a fresh look at transport policy, and although she admired Beeching's intellect, and agreed with much that he had done, especially in light of the expansion in the use of road transport, she found that he approached transport policy &#145;with an arrogance that comes, I suspect, from a clear mind that sees a logical answer to a situation and cannot tolerate any modification of it to meet human frailty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Castle Diaries, 1964&#150;70</span>, 122). Although not all his recommendations were implemented, by 1969 the track had been reduced from 18,214 miles in 1961 to 12,098, and the number of railway stations from 7025 in 1961 to 3002. Critics later pointed out that he should have been more aware of the interdependence of the parts of the railway system: for example, many passengers used main-line services only because they connected with local branch lines. British Railways continued to run at a deficit (&pound;134 million in 1963, &pound;147 million in 1969), but Beeching's four years at British Railways succeeded in bringing public attention to bear on the question of how to run the railway system and make it pay. Even before his resignation, Beeching allowed himself to be drawn into political arguments. Tony Benn, after a lunch in January 1965 at which Beeching had launched an attack on &#145;overblown democracy&#146;, observed: &#145;I think Beeching imagined himself as a new de Gaulle, emerging from industry to save the nation&#146;  (Benn, 205). Unwisely, he continued to rise to the bait, as when he found himself arguing in a Cambridge Union debate in 1968 that managerial efficiency was the ultimate goal.<br>
<br>Beeching received a life peerage in 1965. He returned to ICI as deputy chairman, but, disappointed at having been passed over as chairman, he left in 1970 to serve as chairman of Redland Ltd, the building materials group, until 1977. He remained as a director until 1984 and continued to advise on research and development. He was also a director of Furness Withy &amp; Co. Ltd, the shipowners, from 1972 to 1975, and chairman from 1973 to 1975. He served on several public bodies, including the National Economic Development Council from 1962 to 1964 and the Top Salaries Review Body from 1971 to 1975. He was also chairman of the royal commission on assizes and quarter sessions in 1966: his report was implemented in the <span class="roman">Courts Act</span> of 1971. Beeching was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of London in 1966. He died on 23 March 1985 in the Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, Sussex.<br>
