<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Somner,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1598, <em>d.</em> 1669), <span class="occ">antiquary and Anglo-Saxon scholar</span>, was baptized on 5 November 1598 at St Margaret's, Canterbury, one of three sons of William Somner, registrar of the court of Canterbury, and his wife, Anne Winston. His widow and son believed his birth date to be 30 March 1606  (Kennett, 3.119). He was educated by Mr Ludd at the free school of Canterbury. He became a clerk to his father, and was subsequently appointed registrar of the ecclesiastical courts of Canterbury by Archbishop Laud.<br>
<br>Somner was twice married, first on 12 June 1634 to Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1599), daughter of William Thurgar of Teversham, Cambridgeshire, and second on 1 December 1659 to Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1706), daughter of John Dawson, the chief searcher of Kent. After Somner's death she married Henry Hanningham, vicar of Elham, Kent. His first marriage produced one son and three daughters, the second one daughter and three sons.<br>
<br>Canterbury was Somner's home throughout his life, and the focus of his antiquarian endeavours. These were encouraged by his colleague Meric Casaubon, whom Somner described as his &#145;precious friend and ever-honoured Mecoenas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Treatise of Gavelkind</span>, 1660, preface). His first publication was <span class="italic">The antiquities of Canterbury, or, A survey of that ancient citie, with the suburbs and cathedrall, etc.</span> (1640, reissued 1662; 2nd edn by Nicholas Batteley, 1703). The book was dedicated to his patron Laud, praised for his preservation of antiquities. The text is thoroughly Laudian, describing Becket's shrine as the &#145;glory&#146; of Canterbury &#145;cut down&#146; at the Reformation  (pp. 245&#150;51), and calling for the restoration &#145;to each Parochial Church and Chapell the forgotten name and memory of such Saint or Saints, as at their dedication &hellip; were given (and are therefore proper) to them&#146;  (p. 510). It is said to be the first book published with an appendix containing original records  (S. Pegge, <span class="italic">Anonymiana</span>, 1809, 7). Somner made further collections for a history of Kent. In 1647 he wrote &#145;A treatise of gavelkind, both name and thing&#146; (1660), noting in the preface his failure to produce a county history since the civil war had necessitated &#145;other thoughts, chiefly how I might secure my self against the fury &hellip; of the present storm&#146;.<br>
<br>Somner, a keen royalist, attempted to hide the muniments of Canterbury from iconoclastic parliamentary soldiers, and was responsible for preserving the pieces of the cathedral's font, smashed in 1642, for reconstruction in 1660. The loss of patronage after Laud's fall did not deter Somner from promoting the royal cause. Early in 1649 he published a passionate elegy entitled &#145;The in-securitie of princes, considered in an occasionall meditation upon the kings late sufferings and death&#146;, describing Charles as &#145;a myrror fit for all posterity&#146; and &#145;three Kingdoms choicest treasure&#146;. This was followed by &#145;The frontispiece of the kings book opened&#146; (1650?), an exposition of the portrait of Charles I in <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> and a call to recognize Charles II as king.<br>
<br>The turbulence of the period hampered Somner's access to libraries, as he complained to Sir Simonds D'Ewes in 1649  (BL, Add. MS 22916, fol. 57). Nevertheless, at Casaubon's suggestion Somner devoted himself to learning Anglo-Saxon. Together with legal skills gained from his employment, this enabled him to complete a Latin commentary and glossary on the laws of Henry I  (BL, Harleian MS 684). The work was dedicated to Sir Roger Twysden, who in 1644 had published the Henrician statutes. In 1650 Casaubon published Somner's &#145;Ad verba vetera Germanica&#146; as an appendix to his <span class="italic">De quatuor linguis commentationis</span>. Somner's varied talents were employed by William Dugdale and Roger Dodsworth in the first volume of <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> (1655), for which he translated Anglo-Saxon documents into English and provided information on Kent's religious houses. In 1656 he published <span class="italic">Iulii Caesaris portus Iccius</span>, a reply to J. J. Chifflet on the Roman expeditions to Britain, which survives in E. Gibson's 1694 edition of both works.<br>
<br>In 1657 Archbishop Ussher persuaded Roger Spelman to present Somner with the Anglo-Saxon lectureship at Cambridge founded by his grandfather Henry Spelman. This provided financial support for his most important work, the magisterial <span class="italic">Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum, voces, phrasesque praecipuas Anglo-Saxonicas &hellip; cum Latina et Anglica vocum interpretatione complectens</span> (1659). Although, as the author admitted, it was not without errors, the dictionary enabled Anglo-Saxon studies to flourish. Demand for it caused the issue of a second edition in 1701 by Thomas Benson entitled <span class="italic">Vocabularium Anglo-Saxonicum</span>.<br>
<br>In 1659 Somner was imprisoned in Deal Castle after soliciting petitions for a free parliament, but was rewarded at the Restoration with the mastership of St John's Hospital, Canterbury, and the office of auditor of Canterbury Cathedral, a position he occupied until his death. The breadth of Somner's interests, his linguistic abilities, and the disciplined scholarship of his publications, led to a well-deserved reputation. He corresponded with many renowned antiquaries and he was the first port of call for anyone interested in Anglo-Saxon. Some of his Kent collections were published posthumously as <span class="italic">Chartham news, or, A brief relation of some strange bones there lately digged up, in some grounds of Mr. J. Somner's, of Canterbury</span> (1669), and <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent</span> (1693) which included a &#145;Life of Somner&#146; by Bishop Kennett. Somner died in Canterbury on 30 March 1669 and was buried on 2 April at St Margaret's, Canterbury, where a tablet was erected several years later in praise of his scholarship, piety, and royalism.<br>
