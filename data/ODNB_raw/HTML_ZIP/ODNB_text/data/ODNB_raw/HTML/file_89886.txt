<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gladwin,  Derek Oliver</span>, Baron Gladwin of Clee  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 6 June 1930 at the County Maternity Home, Grimsby, the son of Albert Gladwin, marine fitter, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oliver. At the time of his birth his parents were living at 10 Beeley Road, Grimsby. His father was a shop steward for the Amalgamated Engineering Union. He was educated at Carr Lane junior school, Grimsby, and Wintringham grammar school. He left at the age of sixteen to work first for British Railways in Grimsby, latterly at Grimsby fish docks. As a railwayman he was exempt from national service.<br>
<br>In 1953 Gladwin went to Ruskin College, Oxford. As was his way, he &#145;persuaded&#146; Ruskin that he should design his own programme of studies&#151;industrial relations and labour law. This brought him into early contact with Hugh Clegg of Nuffield College, who became an important influence. He maintained strong links with Ruskin after finishing his course, being elected a member of the governing council, and serving as chairman from 1979 to 1999. He was devoted to its interests and, in the 1960s and 1970s, persuaded successive Labour ministers of education to agree to its expansion and development. In 2000 he was made the college's first life president.<br>
<br>On leaving Ruskin in 1955 Gladwin went to the London School of Economics and took the one-year diploma in personnel management. In 1956 he was appointed a district officer in the southern region of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW), and on 13 October in the same year, at the parish church in Clee, Grimsby, he married Ruth Ann Pinion, daughter of Herbert Pinion. They settled in Surrey and had one son. In 1963 Gladwin became an NUGMW national industrial officer for local government and health, during which time he played an important part in the successful &#145;dirty jobs&#146; strike in local authority services.<br>
<br>In 1970, by a comfortable margin, Gladwin was elected regional secretary for the southern region of the NUGMW, thus becoming one of the &#145;barons&#146; of the union. Over the next twenty years in which he remained regional secretary he was noted for his tenacious defence of his members' interests. He never stood for the post of general secretary (supporting, in turn, the successful candidatures of David Basnett and John Edmonds), and from 1980 to 1982 served as chairman. However, Edmonds felt that the chair of the union should be a &#145;lay activist&#146;. Gladwin took the view that this was &#145;silly&#146; and never quite forgave Edmonds  (private information). Edmonds none the less put Gladwin on the general council of the TUC on behalf of his union, and Gladwin used his membership to develop contacts with leading members of other unions. Following mergers, the NUGMW had meanwhile become the General and Municipal Workers' Union (GMWU) in 1976, and then became the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union (GMBATU) in 1982 (and in 1989 GMB).<br>
<br>From 1970 to 1990 Gladwin was part of his union's delegation to the Labour Party's annual conference, and hence was eligible for membership of its powerful conference arrangements committee. He became chairman in 1974, at a time when the committee was of great importance to the leadership of the party, and retained the position until 1990. Gladwin was at his best when dealing with rank-and-file delegates who wished to question its decisions. They found him sympathetic, fair, and ready to stand up for them against union leaders and others who treated them with scant respect. Yet he also tried to help the four Labour leaders whom he served (Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Michael Foot, and Neil Kinnock). As a result he facilitated the changes in the Labour Party's constitution when conference decided that its system of government should be transformed&#151;although he was personally against most of these changes, fearing (rightly) that they would be used to concentrate power in the hands of the parliamentary leadership.<br>
<br>Gladwin could never persuade Labour leaders to speak to time. They also often ignored his advice on how to get the best from the annual conference. He failed most spectacularly with the leader he thought he was closest to, Jim Callaghan. Gladwin could not believe that Callaghan was serious about his impractical and counter-productive 5 per cent pay norm, and he was particularly bitter when, after it collapsed, ministers tried to pretend that they had not been warned that it would not work and had somehow been &#145;let down&#146; by the union leaders. During the Thatcherite era that followed the &#145;winter of discontent&#146; of 1978&#150;9, Gladwin had to watch many of his parliamentary friends desert the party to found, or join, the Social Democratic Party. For him this was the ultimate betrayal. He was not so much &#145;old Labour&#146; as &#145;broad Labour&#146;. That is to say, his ultimate loyalty was to the party's institutions and its longstanding aims. His attachment to individuals, even leaders, was in this sense contingent.<br>
<br>Gladwin was on the boards of the Post Office (1972&#150;94) and British Aerospace (1977&#150;91) and a member of the council of the Industrial Society from 1968 to 1991. Among other public services he was chairman of the board of trustees of the British Diabetic Association from 1995 to 2001. He was also a visiting fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1978 to 1986. He was appointed OBE in 1977 and CBE in 1979, and was made a life peer as Baron Gladwin of Clee in 1994. On his elevation to the Lords he almost immediately became a whip. He took the work very seriously and, as a result, was asked to become deputy chief whip in 1997. After reflection, he decided that he preferred to &#145;work from behind&#146;  (personal knowledge). Part of the reason for this decision was that by then he had taken on so many good and interesting causes which he felt he could not give up, despite failing health.<br>
<br>Remaining active in his retirement, Gladwin died on 10 April 2003 at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Downs Road, Sutton, of acute myeloid leukaemia. He was survived by his wife, Ruth, and their son.<br>
