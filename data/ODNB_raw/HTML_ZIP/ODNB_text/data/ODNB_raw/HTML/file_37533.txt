<span class="headword">Hepplewhite,  George</span>  (1727?&#150;1786), <span class="occ">cabinet-maker and furniture designer</span>, of whose origins firm evidence is lacking, was almost certainly born in 1727, the son of George Hepplewhite (1678&#150;1733) of Ryton, a prosperous Tyneside village in co. Durham, and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rootlish (<i>d</i>. 1729), his wife. If this identification is correct, both Hepplewhite and his successor in the standard canon of English furniture designers, Thomas Sheraton, were natives of co. Durham, albeit from opposite ends of the county. Hepplewhite was first mentioned when his fourth son, Benjamin William, was baptized at St James's, Clerkenwell, in 1768. Clerkenwell was then an important centre of the furniture trade, the seat of such celebrated firms as those of Giles Grendey and of William and Richard Gomm. Hepplewhite is next mentioned, again in Clerkenwell, in 1776, when his first son, George, was apprenticed to John Bowyer, citizen and turner, of Clerkenwell Close. In November 1784, when George achieved his freedom, the family were still in Clerkenwell. At Christmas 1785, however, Hepplewhite and his son George insured premises at 48 Redcross Street, Cripplegate, with the Sun Insurance Company. &#145;Utensils and stock&#146; were valued at &pound;500. Hepplewhite had died intestate at Redcross Street by 27 June 1786, when administration was granted to his widow, Alice. In 1786 &#145;Kepplewhite &amp; Son&#146; were listed in Lowndes's London directory at 48 Redcross Street. The auction of &#145;the valuable stock on trade and household furniture of Mr. Hepplewhite, cabinet manufacturer deceased&#146; was announced in the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> (10 October 1786). That Hepplewhite's third son, John, subscribed to the <span class="italic">Treatise on the Five Orders of Architecture</span> (1787) by George Richardson, a former draughtsman for the Adam firm, and that his second son, Andrew, was listed as a drawing master at 6 Oxendon Street, Haymarket, in 1811, suggests connections with the book trade and with architectural and design circles.<br>
<br>In 1788 Isaac and Josiah Taylor published <span class="italic">The cabinet-maker and upholsterer's guide, or, Repository of designs for every article of household furniture, in the newest and most approved taste &hellip; the whole exhibiting near three hundred different designs, engraved on one hundred and twenty-six plates: from drawings by A. Heppelwhite and Co. cabinet-makers</span> from their architectural library at 56 Holborn. No compendium of furniture designs had appeared since 1762, when Thomas Chippendale issued the third edition of his <span class="italic">Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director</span>. In publishing the Hepplewhite <span class="italic">Guide</span> the Taylors were filling a yawning gap. The plates were issued in batches at the beginning of July, September, and October 1787. In January and February 1788 a subscription was promoted in such papers as the <span class="italic">Lincoln, Rutland and Stamford Mercury</span> and <span class="italic">Williamson's Liverpool Advertiser</span>. The price was 2 guineas. The preface adopts a modest tone: &#145;To unite elegance and utility, and blend the useful with the agreeable, has ever been considered a difficult but an honourable task.&#146; It stressed the <span class="italic">Guide</span>'s utility to &#145;the mechanic&#146;, to &#145;young workmen in general, and occasionally to more experienced ones&#146;. A successful subscription &#145;enabled us to exceed the number of plates originally proposed&#146;.<br>
<br>The designs, covering many furniture types, are either plain and functional or in a competent but unadventurous neo-classical manner, which seems indebted to the example of James Wyatt. Given their backward character and the fact that they appeared scarcely a year after George Hepplewhite's death, the traditional suggestion that Alice, his widow, was capitalizing on his designs seems plausible. However, the appearance in 1789 of a second edition with an extra plate, and of six plates signed &#145;Hepplewhite&#146; or &#145;Heppelwhite&#146; and dated October, November, and December 1792 and May 1793 in <span class="italic">The Cabinet-Makers' London Book of Prices</span> edition of 1793 suggests that the firm designed after his death. This was proven when, in reaction to criticism from Thomas Sheraton, who stated in his <span class="italic">Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing Book</span> (1793) that the Hepplewhite <span class="italic">Guide</span> had already &#145;caught the decline&#146; in design standards, a third edition was issued in 1794 containing new or altered plates, in which many curvilinear or shield-back chairs of 1788 are replaced by neat rectilinear forms in the French style, which Sheraton had derived from Henry Holland at Carlton House. Perhaps John and/or Andrew Hepplewhite may have been responsible for these &#145;posthumous&#146; productions. The <span class="italic">Guide</span>'s text, containing information on nomenclature, fashion, materials, finishes, and upholstery, was changed in 1794 to take account of the altered plates, only two of which bear that date, but, curiously, comments of 1788 on a chair &#145;executed with a good effect for his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales&#146; apply, in 1794, to a completely different design.<br>
<br>The Hepplewhite <span class="italic">Guide</span> was influential beyond England, in America, in Denmark, where J. C. Lillie used it for designing chairs for Liselund in 1793, and in Germany, where F. G. Hoffmann pirated Hepplewhite designs in his <span class="italic">Meubles-Magazin</span> (1795). A late nineteenth-century Hepplewhite revival led to an 1897 reprint of the <span class="italic">Guide</span> by Batsford, and a modest myth grew up around George Hepplewhite, who was stated to have been apprenticed to Gillows of Lancaster and London: this seems unlikely as, in 1801, they wrote: &#145;We have not Hebbelthwaite's Publication&#146;  (Westminster Reference Library, Gillow Records).<br>
