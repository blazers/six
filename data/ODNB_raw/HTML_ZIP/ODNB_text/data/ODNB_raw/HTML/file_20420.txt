<span class="headword">Nyren,  John</span>  (1764&#150;1837), <span class="occ">cricket historian</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65593/', "Richard Nyren (1734&#150;1797)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64816/', "Hambledon cricket club")</script>] and his wife, Frances Pennycud (<i>c</i>.1740&#150;<i>c</i>.1830), of Slindon, in Sussex, was almost certainly born in the parish of Catherington, two miles east of Hambledon, Hampshire, on 15 December 1764. From about 1762 his parents lived at the Hut (later renamed the Bat and Ball inn), which overlooked the Hambledon cricket ground, Broadhalfpenny Down. The Nyrens bore the Sussex name variously known as Nieren or Niering&#151;the latter being the name borne by John's grandfather. Research in the 1960s by Edmund Esdaile challenged the earlier view that they were of Jacobite origin and kinsmen of the Nairnes who supported the Jacobite risings in 1715. There remains, nevertheless, the testimony of John Nyren's granddaughter Mary Nyren, who recalled being told that her grandfather had compared watch-chain seals with William, Lord Nairne, towards the end of his life and found the crests on them were identical  (Lucas, 99). Richard Nyren, whom his son later called &#145;a thorough-bred old English yeoman&#146;, had learned his cricket from his uncle Richard Newland at Slindon. He became &#145;the chosen General of all the matches&#146; acting as secretary to the Hambledon cricket club and playing an intermediary role between its aristocratic patrons and the players themselves. As a player, he scored 98 for Hambledon against Surrey in 1775 and 70 against England in 1776 but he is known chiefly for his stewardship of the club's affairs and his role as landlord of the Bat and Ball inn and, from about 1770, the George inn in the centre of Hambledon village, to where the family moved.<br>
<br>John Nyren was educated by a Jesuit who taught him a little Latin, &#145;but I was a better hand at the fiddle&#146;. He interested himself in cricket at an early age, &#145;being since 1778 a sort of farmer's pony to my native club of Hambledon&#146;. He was a left-handed batsman who played a few times for Hambledon in the 1780s. He joined the newly formed Homerton club, then second in importance only to the slightly older Marylebone Cricket Club, and is first listed on a score sheet in 1801. For Homerton against the MCC at Lord's in that year he made 49. He played for England from 1802 to 1805 and appeared for the Gentlemen in 1806 in the first ever match against the Players. Cricket was for him a &#145;recreation, not an occupation&#146;. His last match of importance was for Lord Frederick Beauclerk's eleven at Lord's in 1817 against a team raised by William Ward. It was to Ward that Nyren later dedicated the book on which his reputation rests. This was <span class="italic">The Young Cricketer's Tutor &hellip; to which is added &#145;The Cricketers of my Time&#146;</span>, &#145;the whole collected and edited by C. C. Clarke&#146; (1833).<br>
<br>By the time of the book's publication Nyren was &#145;still a sort of youth at seventy, hale and vigorous and with a merry twinkle of his eye&#146;. He had become part of a cultural and social circle that included Leigh Hunt (who wrote those words in 1834), Charles Lamb, the organist, composer, and publisher Vincent Novello, and Novello's son-in-law the Shakespearian scholar Charles Cowden Clarke. While he played the violin and talked music with Novello, Nyren chatted on cricket to Clarke and out of their conversations emerged the book. The first part is severely functional and didactic but the second sees the old Hambledon club and its great players through the rose-coloured spectacles of nostalgia at a distance of some forty years. Nyren evokes their way of life as much as their cricket, and provides what John Arlott called one of &#145;the few peasant portraits in the language&#146;.<br>
<br>There are Tom Walker and his brother Harry&#151;&#145;never sure came two such unadulterated rustics into a civilized community&#146;; John Small who charmed &#145;a vicious bull&#146; with his fiddle; George Leer, the longstop, &#145;as sure of the ball as if he had been a sandbank&#146;; Tom Sueter, &#145;the manliest and most graceful of hitters&#146; and the sweetest of tenors; David Harris, the bowler, whom &#145;Phidias would have taken as a model&#146;; Lamborn, the shepherd, &#145;a plain-spoken bumpkin&#146; whose off-breaks were too good for the duke of Dorset; and William Beldham (Silver Billy), the only Hambledon player to survive into the photographic age.<br>
<br>These men have passed into the folklore of cricket history yet intriguing questions remain about their biographer. Talented as he undoubtedly was as a musician, it seems doubtful that he could have aspired to such flights of fancy as a writer. He readily conceded Clarke's editorship and his friend must have had the wit and wisdom to capture the romantic enthusiasm of the spoken word. Mrs Cowden Clarke in her autobiography, <span class="italic">My Long Life</span> (1896), recalled &#145;the chuckling pride&#146; with which Nyren told his tale to her husband. The book won instant praise from the reviewers, including Hunt in the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> and John Mitford in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. It ran to eleven editions in twenty-five years. Over a hundred years later Arlott wrote that it was &#145;one of the very few books ever written on any game which [could] stand squarely upon its merits outside the literature of sport&#146;.<br>
<br>John Nyren left Hambledon on his marriage in 1791 to Cleopha Copp (1772/3&#150;1835), a &#145;wealthy&#146; young woman of German parentage. They settled in Portsea, Hampshire, before moving to Bromley by Bow in Middlesex and then to Battersea. He was a calico printer on a large scale until his premises were burnt down. During the years of his literary and musical friendships he lived in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. According to Nyren's granddaughter he met at Lord's the sixth Lord Nairne (whose attainted title George IV had restored), which is how the two men came to compare watch-chains. In 1830 he is recorded at Battersea, Surrey, and is listed as a partner in a firm manufacturing chemicals, vinegar, and other products.<br>
<br>Some seventy years after Nyren's death the essayist E. V. Lucas became acquainted with his granddaughter, who set down her memories for him. Nyren had &#145;an instinctive admiration of everything good and tasteful, both in nature and art&#146;. He was a good enough composer to have three of his pieces published by Novello, including an <span class="italic">Ave verum</span>, and he had been for thirteen years choirmaster at St Mary Moorfields, where Novello himself was organist.<br>
<br>Nyren's wife predeceased him. They had three daughters, one of whom&#151;Mary A. Nyren (1798/9&#150;1848)&#151;became abbess of the English convent at Bruges. Nyren died at Bromley by Bow, on 28 June 1837 and was buried in Bromley churchyard.<br>
