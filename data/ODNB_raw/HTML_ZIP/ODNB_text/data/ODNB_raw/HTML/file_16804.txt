<span class="headword">Livingstone <span class="st"> [Livingston]</span>,  George</span>, third earl of Linlithgow  (1616&#150;1690), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in July 1616, the eldest son of Alexander Livingstone, from 1622 second earl of Linlithgow (<i>d</i>. 1648), and his first wife, Lady Elizabeth Gordon, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11036/', "George Gordon, first marquess of Huntly")</script>. From 1622 until his succession to the earldom George was styled Lord Livingstone. His early years were spent with his maternal grandfather, and in 1626 the king wrote to Linlithgow expressing his displeasure that the young Lord Livingstone was being brought up in the household of the Catholic Huntly: &#145;in regard of his [Huntly's] aversness from the religion professed within that our kingdome not giving the Church satisfaction, we doe not lyk that your sone should be bred up in such companie&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 8.28). Nevertheless, there is no evidence that George as an adult deviated from the Church of Scotland in his religion, moving from presbyterian to episcopalian when the church did at the Restoration. In the summer of 1640 he attended the court of Elizabeth of Bohemia at The Hague. On 15 December 1642 he was appointed constable and keeper of Linlithgow Palace and Blackness Castle upon the resignation of his father.<br>
<br>The Scottish estates appointed Livingstone colonel of the Stirlingshire foot in the army of the solemn league and covenant on 26 August 1646. He also became a member of the Clackmannanshire committee of war. He served with his regiment at Marston Moor and led it in storming the Sandgate during the climax of the siege of Newcastle. Livingstone and his regiment subsequently quartered in co. Durham, then served in Leven's field army during the 1645 campaign. In November 1645 he was under investigation by the estates for communicating with royalists. In 1648 he commanded the Midlothian and Linlithgowshire horse in support of the engagement for the rescue of Charles I. He resisted the whiggamore raid of late summer 1648. As a result of being an engager he was barred from all state offices.<br>
<br>Livingstone succeeded his father as earl on the latter's death between 11 June and 20 December 1648. On 30 July 1650 he married his first wife, Lady Elizabeth Maule (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18368/', "Patrick Maule, first earl of Panmure")</script>, and widow of John Lyon, second earl of Kinghorn. She was the mother of all Linlithgow's children before her death at Castle Huntly in October 1659. In October 1650 Linlithgow repented as an engager, removing his incapacity for holding offices. On 4 December he was admitted to the estates, which on the 29th nominated him to command a cavalry regiment from Perthshire. In January 1651 Hartwoodburn's Horse was added to his regiment. He served in the Worcester campaign but escaped capture. By 1653 he had become a supporter of the English regime in Scotland; he was one of the few nobles not penalized in Cromwell's <span class="roman">Act of Pardon and Grace</span>. However, the Scottish royalists in Glencairn's rising burnt his Perthshire estates. In 1654&#150;5 Linlithgow represented Perthshire in Oliver Cromwell's parliament, and he was again in the united parliament in 1656 and 1659. He became a JP (another sign of English favour) in 1656.<br>
<br>Despite his service to the protectorate, at the Restoration Linlithgow received the colonelcy of the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, and a place on the privy council on 13 July 1661. He served on various commissions of the council and regularly attended parliament until his death. On 5 May 1663 he began a lengthy career of suppressing covenanters when the council ordered him to enforce the regime's anti-presbyterian religious policies. In the same cause the council named him one of the justiciars in the south-west on 5 December 1666. He seems to have gained additional military commands for on 9 October 1667 the council disbanded his regiment and sent his men to Lord George Douglas's Foot in the French service. On 29 October the king commissioned him a colonel of foot with the earl of Kellie as his lieutenant-colonel and Sir James Turner as his major. Several weeks later, on 26 November, the council appointed Linlithgow commander-in-chief in Scotland during the absences of the lord chancellor. On 22 June 1671 he became colonel of the King's regiment of foot guards. In a change from state business he was noted as feuding with his stepbrother Alexander who had succeeded their uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16808/', "James Livingston")</script> as earl of Callendar over the detention of goods bequeathed by the latter in 1674. The council appointed Linlithgow colonel of the Linlithgowshire and Peeblesshire militia on 25 February 1675. On 8 June 1676 he received command of his heir, George's, horse troop during the latter's absence. The regime's use of the earl in military affairs is further indicated by his appointment to the militia committee in 1676. Likewise his support of its authoritarian policies appears from his position as supervisor of the election for provost in Linlithgow.<br>
<br>In June 1677 Linlithgow married again; his second wife was Agnes Wauchope, daughter and coheir of George Wauchope, merchant and burgess of Edinburgh, and widow of Alexander Scott, goldsmith, of Edinburgh. During that year the earl became a member of the highland and public affairs committee. On 26 December the council recorded his appointment as Sir George Monro's replacement as major-general of horse and foot in Scotland&#151;or simply commander-in-chief. His assistance in suppressing the conventicles is apparent from his appointment on the anti-covenanter committee for the west on 18 January 1678. His actions in assailing the covenanters gained him the council's thanks that April. He received and implemented additional orders to the same end. In December the council had him make the militia take the oath of allegiance and supremacy. In January 1679 he garrisoned Blackness Castle (a prison for covenanters) and imposed order in Edinburgh. In March and May the council authorized him to act against covenanters in Linlithgowshire and Fife. After the defeat of Claverhouse at Drumclog on 1 June 1679, the earl became disheartened. On 6 June he asked for English or Irish reinforcements. Meanwhile he had ordered Claverhouse to fall back to the main army at Stirling. The united royal army failed to confront the rebels, but retreated to Edinburgh where it awaited reinforcements from England. On 18 June James, earl of Monmouth, arrived with English troops and took command of the army. After Monmouth's victory at Bothwell Bridge the council sent Linlithgow and Claverhouse to London to advocate sterner measures against the rebellious areas.<br>
<br>On 19 September Linlithgow resigned as major-general and commander-in-chief and had his former rank abolished owing to the demobilization of the army. He again became or was reconfirmed as constable of Blackness Castle on 15 January 1680. His importance in local affairs is apparent from his appointment as convener of the Linlithgowshire excise commissioners. His military duties continued in 1681 with service in the Linlithgowshire&#150;Peeblesshire militia and reduction of his regiment. Likewise he continued to repress dissent, this time as the imposer of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> on Linlithgow, Queensferry, the regality of Ogilface, and the JPs of Linlithgowshire. On 7 January 1682 he replaced Callendar, who had refused the test, in a heritable jurisdiction in Stirlingshire. In November he became a member of the commission to proceed against the disaffected in Linlithgowshire. The following year the council named him convener of the shire's JPs and provost of Queensferry. The king made him lord justice-general on 15 July 1684. Owing to his personal expenditure in repairing Blackness Castle his royal pension rose to &pound;200 sterling annually in December 1685. With the revolution of 1689 he lost his offices, but he accepted the convention of estates as a free and lawful assembly. In April he was named to the Linlithgowshire commission for supply. He died on 1 February 1690 and was buried at St Michael's Kirk, Linlithgow. The earl exemplified the self-interested Scots nobleman of the second half of the seventeenth century, who exchanged political and religious principles for personal aggrandizement.<br>
<br>Linlithgow's elder son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16805/', "George Livingstone")</script> (<i>d</i>. 7 Aug 1695), was implicated in Jacobite activities in 1689. After brief imprisonment he submitted; though apparently still toying with Jacobitism, in May 1690 the new earl of Linlithgow was reported as having &#145;beaten the Highlanders&#146; and in 1692 he was admitted to the privy council  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 8.31). The younger son Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1692), who had succeeded by entail to the earldom of Callendar in 1685, likewise was imprisoned for Jacobitism with his brother in 1689. Linlithgow's daughter Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1683) married Robert MacGill, viscount of Oxfuird and Lord MacGill of Cousland.<br>
