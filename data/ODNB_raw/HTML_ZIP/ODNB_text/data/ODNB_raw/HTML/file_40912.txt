<span class="headword">Devas,  (Thomas) Anthony</span>  (1911&#150;1958), <span class="occ">portrait, still-life, and landscape painter</span>, was born on 8 January 1911 in Bromley, Kent, the second son of the four children of Thomas Gronow Devas, chairman of the City of London wholesale textile firm Devas Routledge, and his wife, Marjorie Cecilia Wilson. While at Repton School, Devas sought solace from his unhappiness there in the school art studio, and he was encouraged by the art master, Arthur Norris, to leave at sixteen to pursue his painting at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. From 1927 he studied there under Henry Tonks and Philip Wilson Steer, made lifelong friends with Rodrigo Moynihan, Robin Darwin, and William Coldstream, and fell in love with Nicolette Macnamara (1911&#150;1987) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60662/', "Devas, Nicolette")</script>], daughter of the Irish poet&#150;philosopher Francis Macnamara and sister of Caitlin, the future wife of Dylan Thomas.<br>
<br>The pattern of both Devas's artistic and personal life was thus effectively already established by the time he left the Slade and married Nicolette, on 25 June 1931. Through her he was drawn into the orbit of Augustus John, in whose m&eacute;nage the Macnamara girls had been raised, and whose influence can be felt in the portraits of both Nicolette and Caitlin (Tate collection), painted during the war years when, owing to ill health, Devas was serving as an air raid warden in Chelsea. Like portraits of close friends from this period, such as the poet Laurie Lee (1944 version on loan to the National Portrait Gallery, London), they are now generally accepted as being among his best work.<br>
<br>Devas had initially been associated in the public mind with his friends in the Euston Road School, partly because of shared subject matter such as gently realist portraits and figure subjects, but also through the subdued colours and soft focus of his early work. By 1941, when he had his first major exhibition at Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons Ltd, he had built up a small but enlightened portrait clientele who favoured the informality of his approach and greater freedom of brushwork than that offered by other members of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, of which he became a member in 1945. Official commissions included portraits for the War Artists' Advisory Committee and one of Sir George Dyson for the Royal College of Music in 1952. That same year his portrait of Count Benckendorff helped to secure his election as associate of the Royal Academy, where he had been exhibiting regularly since showing <span class="italic">Flowers in a Yellow Jug</span> there in 1940.<br>
<br>Portraits of Devas's three children, including <span class="italic">Emma Dressed Up</span> (Museum and Art Gallery, Derby), were influential in securing a demand for child portraits, but the undeniable charm which he brought to these and to portraits of fashionable women became increasingly decorative as his approach became correspondingly conservative. The portrait of Camilla and Mark Sykes (1947, Bradford Art Galleries and Museums) and subject pictures such as <span class="italic">At the Couturier</span> (1955, Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston) are typical of the fashionable chic which won him a popular following, and in 1953 he painted a series of &#145;Aero&#146; girls for Rowntrees chocolate. His portrait of Elizabeth II, painted for the Royal Artillery company in 1957, now has little more than period charm to recommend it, though his last commission, <span class="italic">Peggy Ashcroft as Imogen</span>, painted for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and exhibited posthumously at the Royal Academy in 1959, has a freshness and originality which are said to have reduced Augustus John to tears.<br>
<br>Following two years of heart trouble, Anthony Devas died suddenly after a stroke on 21 December 1958 at his home, Flat 3, 86 Elm Park Gardens, Chelsea. Nicolette Devas, in her excellent autobiography <span class="italic">Two Flamboyant Fathers</span> (1966), described her husband's stammer, his &#145;over-sensitive face&#146; and &#145;extreme good looks in the romantic Rupert Brooke style&#146;, and included an invaluable account both of his portrait practice and of their life and friendships in the Chelsea of the 1940s and 1950s.<br>
