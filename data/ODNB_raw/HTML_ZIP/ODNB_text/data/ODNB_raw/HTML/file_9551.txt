<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  George Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Fighting Fitzgerald]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1746&#150;1786), <span class="occ">duellist</span>, was the eldest son of George Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1782) of Turlough, co. Mayo, and Lady Mary Hervey (1725&#150;1815), formerly maid of honour to the Princess Amelia, and sister to three successive earls of Bristol, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13111/', "Frederick Augustus Hervey, fourth earl of Bristol (1730&#150;1803)")</script>, bishop of Derry. He was educated at Eton College, which he left to join the army, and it was while stationed at Galway that he fought his first duel&#151;a harmless exchange of shots. He received a serious head injury, however, in a subsequent encounter with a fellow officer.<br>
<br>Having left the army, Fitzgerald persuaded Jane Conolly (<i>d</i>. 1779) of Castletown to marry him, against the advice of her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6096/', "Thomas Conolly (1738&#150;1803)")</script> in 1770. She brought him a fortune of &pound;10,000, some of which the couple used to sustain an extravagant lifestyle in Paris. Following a difference with a creditor in France, Fitzgerald fought a bloody duel at Valenciennes in the Southern Netherlands in which he clearly displayed murderous intent, but there was no legal retribution because his second, Hamilton Rowan, allayed the suspicions of the French authorities. In London, where he styled himself as a man of fashion or macaroni, Fitzgerald became involved in three more disputes. He met with more than he bargained for in July 1773 when his intervention in an altercation between Captain Croftes and Henry Bate, the editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, rebounded upon him and exposed him to public opprobrium. Fitzgerald was not easily shamed, but his attempt to redeem his reputation by challenging Major John Scawen a month later did him little good, while his public repudiation of allegations of misconduct during their duel by Cornet Thomas Walker in 1775 was so intemperate as to serve no useful purpose. Back in Ireland for the 1776 general election in which his father was a candidate for co. Mayo, Fitzgerald fought a duel with Cornet Swords. More famously, shortly after his permanent return to Ireland in 1779, he fought the noted &#145;fireater&#146; Alexander English, of Springfield, co. Tipperary, at Stephen's Green in an encounter in which he escaped with his life only because of the intervention of &#145;several gentlemen&#146;  (Walsh, 26&#150;7).<br>
<br>By now separated from his wife, who died in October 1779, Fitzgerald married Sidney, the daughter and heir of Matthew Vaughan of Carrowmore, co. Mayo, in 1782. However, he was chronically short of money, and since his only source of income was his father, who had promised to pay him &pound;1000 annually in return for a capital sum of &pound;8000 in the early 1770s, he returned to Mayo, accompanied by a bear, to secure the money owed. His father did not have it, so George Robert had him legally ousted from the family estate, and when his father sought the payment of the allowance to which he was entitled, George Robert first manacled him to his bear, then to a dray, and later imprisoned him in a &#145;cave&#146;. Such behaviour, combined with his accoutring of a set of local desperadoes as his personal volunteer corps, disturbed local gentlemen and contributed to the precipitation of a sequence of encounters with Caesar French, Hyacinth Martin, and Denis Browne, in none of which did Fitzgerald conduct himself according to the rules of duelling. Indeed, his reign of terror was halted, and then temporarily, only by the intervention of his younger brother, Charles, who prosecuted him to conviction for mistreatment of their father at Castlebar assizes in 1781. George Robert managed to frustrate the efforts of the authorities to imprison him for a time, but he was eventually incarcerated following a retrial. His time in gaol did not have any ameliorative impact on his behaviour, for he was not long out of prison when he embarked on what proved a prolonged affair with another noted duellist, &#145;Humanity Dick&#146; Martin. This was finally concluded with an exchange of shots at Castlebar in July 1784 in which the absence of serious injury was attributed by some to the fact that Fitzgerald wore concealed armour. This, in fact, proved to be Fitzgerald's last duel. He continued to behave in a lawless and erratic manner until he was hanged on 12 June 1786 outside new gaol, Castlebar, for his part in the murder of Patrick Randal McDonnell. He was buried at dawn the next day in Turlough churchyard.<br>
<br>In his short life Fitzgerald fought some twelve duels, which is, by a substantial margin, more than any other known Irish duellist. Indeed, it is improbable that he could have fought so many had he not contrived, as the <span class="italic">Dublin Evening Post</span> reported on 15 June 1786, &#145;to have some advantage of his opponent&#146;. That he did so was partly a reflection of the preparedness of eighteenth-century society to exempt gentlemen from normal legal prescriptions. But it was primarily a consequence of George Robert Fitzgerald's character. He was, one contemporary observed,<blockquote>easily provoked; he would quarrel upon the most trifling occasion; and having once conceived an enmity towards another was of that implacable, revengeful and sanguinary nature as to suffer nothing but the blood of the person from whom he supposed he had received an injury, to appease his wrath. (<span class="italic">The Life and Work of George Robert Fitzgerald</span>, 5, 10)</blockquote>Duelling, in other words, was not simply a matter of honour with Fitzgerald. It was a quasi-legal means of dealing with those who offended or inconvenienced him, which he was able to get away with so long as he did not stray too far to the wrong side of the ill-defined line that separated manslaughter from murder.<br>
