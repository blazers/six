<span class="headword">Lindsey,  Mary</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1697&#150;1713), <span class="occ">singer</span>, made her first known appearance as one of Cynthia's followers in the musical scenes in Elkanah Settle's <span class="italic">The World in the Moon</span> at Dorset Garden Theatre in June 1697. Referred to always as Mrs Lindsey, she may not have been married, for the title merely implies that she was of marriageable age. In autumn 1697 she performed songs by Thomas Morgan in George Powell's <span class="italic">The Imposture Defeated</span> and sang in Morgan's <span class="italic">Musick of the Generall Peace</span>, celebrating the treaty of Ryswick. When Princess Anne (later queen) attended a performance of John Crowne's <span class="italic">Caligula</span> (1698), Mrs Lindsey sang a song specially written for the occasion by the bass singer and composer Richard Leveridge. Eight years later she and Leveridge were two of the &#145;best Singers and Dancers, Foreign and <i>English</i>&#146;  (Downes, 98) who appeared in a command performance at court for Queen Anne.<br>
<br>Mary Lindsey's only speaking role appears to have been Fardell, &#145;an Affected Tattling Nurse&#146;, in Thomas Durfey's <span class="italic">The Campaigners</span> (June 1698), when she sang Daniel Purcell's amusing lullaby, &#145;My dear cockadoodle&#146;, but she was frequently advertised as a singer of incidental music and songs between the acts. She also appeared at York Buildings, then London's leading concert venue. February 1699 saw the premiere at Drury Lane of Peter Motteux's dramatic opera <span class="italic">The Island Princess</span>, with music by Jeremiah Clarke, Daniel Purcell, and Leveridge. Mrs Lindsey appeared in its various musical interludes as a shepherdess, a pretty country lass courted by Leveridge as a &#145;Town-spark&#146;, and an old woman who sang &#145;like one without Teeth&#146;. Her mezzo-soprano voice fitted her for the comic older-woman roles which were to become her speciality. In spring 1702, when Wriothesley Russell, second duke of Bedford, sponsored a performance of John Weldon's <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>, Mrs Lindsey and Mary Ann Campion each received 3 guineas, the highest fee. One of Weldon's most popular songs, &#145;Stop o ye waves&#146;, was described in <span class="italic">Mercurius Musicus</span> for May&#150;June 1701 as &#145;<i>Orpheus's</i> Song to the Waves, in the Mask of <span class="italic">Orpheus and Euridicy</span> Sung by Mrs <i>Linsey</i>&#146;. It is possible that she sang the role of Orpheus in the masque of that name performed at a girls' boarding school at Besselsleigh, near Oxford, in October 1697, when Weldon was organist of New College. However, her commitments at Drury Lane would have made this difficult and the song may have been part of a masque sung at one of Weldon's London concerts.<br>
<br>In January 1705 Mrs Lindsey created the comic role of Nerina, an old nurse, in the first all-sung English opera in the Italian style, Thomas Clayton's <span class="italic">Arsinoe</span>. A year later, in the English version of Giovanni Bononcini's <span class="italic">Camilla</span>, she played Tullia, an ageing lady courted by Linco (Richard Leveridge) for her money. Comic sub-plots for Leveridge and Lindsey featured in London's next two operas, Clayton's <span class="italic">Rosamond</span> (4 March 1707), and John Christopher Pepusch's <span class="italic">Thomyris</span> (1 April 1707). At this time she and Leveridge were frequently advertised as performing dialogues by Henry Purcell. In January 1708 London's two theatre companies were reorganized to form an operatic company at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket, managed by John Vanbrugh, while Drury Lane was reduced to an acting company with no singers. Vanbrugh planned to replace Mrs Lindsey with Anna Lodi, but the Italian made too many demands and Lindsey retained her old roles as a member of the Queen's company, where both she and Leveridge were paid &pound;2 a performance. The operas had become dual-language, with Italian castrati and foreign female singers performing in Italian (and receiving up to &pound;7 10<i>s</i>. a performance). At the Queen's, Mrs Lindsey had one last good role, in the pasticcio <span class="italic">Love's Triumph</span> (26 February 1708), where she sang Serpetta, &#145;an innocent Shepherdess&#146; loved by &#145;a merry, amorous Shepherd&#146;  (Leveridge). In <span class="italic">Clotilda</span> (2 March 1709), Mrs Lindsey had only a minor role as an attendant, and the following January the pasticcio <span class="italic">Almahide</span> was sung completely in Italian except for two low-life comic interludes in English performed between the acts by Lindsey, the comedian Thomas Doggett, and the soprano Letitia Cross. The following season was her last on the London stage. In July 1712 she and Leveridge performed their comic scenes from <span class="italic">Thomyris</span> under the title <span class="italic">The Loves of Baldo and Media</span> at the theatre in Greenwich. She gave benefit concerts at York Buildings in March 1711 and Hickford's Great Room on 15 May 1713. Like other female singers who did not appear during a season except at an annual benefit concert, she may by this time have become a teacher of singing.<br>
