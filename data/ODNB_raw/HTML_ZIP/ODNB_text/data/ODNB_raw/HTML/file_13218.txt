<span class="headword">Hicks,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Hicks Pasha]</span>  (1831&#150;1883), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 29 April 1831, and entered the Bombay army as ensign in December 1849. He served as lieutenant (1856) with the 1st Beluchi battalion in the campaign of 1857&#150;9, as staff officer in the Punjab movable column, and with General Penny in the Rohilkhand campaign, subsequently serving under Lord Clyde. Promoted captain in 1861 he served in the Abyssinian expedition of 1867&#150;8 as brigade major in the 1st division, attaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1875, and honorary colonel in 1880.<br>
<br>Recommended by Valentine Baker Pasha, then commanding the Egyptian gendarmerie, Hicks was dispatched in February 1883 to command the Egyptian army in the Sudan in the suppression of the Mahdi's revolt. When he left Cairo on 7 February with a staff of European officers, the British government and its representatives in Egypt were criticized for allowing him to depart on so hazardous an enterprise with only some ten to twelve thousand troops, many of whom had taken part in the recent rebellion under Arabi Pasha. Hicks reached Berber by way of Suakin, and from there proceeded up the Nile to Khartoum, where he joined his army. A reconnaissance under Colonel the Hon. J. Colborne to Kawa showed the proximity of the enemy, and on Hicks's arrival there an advance into Sennar was resolved on. On 24 April they marched, five thousand strong, with four Nordenfeldt guns, upon Jebel &#145;Ain, and on the way met, on 29 April, a Mahdist force of four or five thousand. Hicks's force won a victory so decisive that, on arriving at Jebel &#145;Ain in June, no enemy was to be found. The province of Sennar was deserted by the Mahdi's troops; the chiefs were assembled and addressed by Hicks with tact in a spirit of conciliation. With the situation apparently tranquil, the army returned to Khartoum.<br>
<br>Later in the year the Mahdi's influence was rapidly spreading in the direction of al-&#145;Ubayd, and Hicks determined to advance to the attack, a decision subsequently much criticized. On 9 September, with more than ten thousand men of low military quality, he left Omdurman and ascended the White Nile to Dueim, from there striking across the desert to al-&#145;Ubayd. Against his will, he was accompanied on his desert march by large bodies of Arabs or Sudanese, who apparently had the approval of the Egyptian governor-general of the Sudan. These men were undoubtedly in league with the Mahdi, while Hicks's chief guide, as afterwards appeared, was in communication with the enemy. On 1 November Hicks and his army, without water and lost in forest country unknown to them, were betrayed into an ambush at Kashgil, where the enemy, commanded by the Mahdi, fired on the Egyptians from a dense cover. Despite extreme thirst, the Egyptians fought for three days. On 5 November their ammunition gave out, and the Mahdists charged the Egyptians and speared the wounded as they lay. Hicks led his mounted staff in a final charge in which he and his comrades were all killed. Following this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, Charles George Gordon was sent to the Sudan to superintend the withdrawal of remaining European and Egyptian forces. Hicks was survived by his wife, Sara Sophia.<br>
