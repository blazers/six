<span class="headword">Owen,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1746), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and nonconformist tutor</span>, was the third son of John Owen, of Bryn, Aber-nant parish, Carmarthenshire, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21012/', "James Owen (1654&#150;1706)")</script>. His parents were &#145;inviolably firm&#146; to the Church of England  (C. Owen, 2), but the nine children who reached adulthood all became nonconformists and the three sons nonconformist ministers. Owen was educated for the nonconformist ministry at the academy at Bishop's Hall, Bethnal Green, London, conducted by Thomas Brand with the assistance of John Ker. In October 1690 he was one of eleven students who sent an adulatory address in Latin to Richard Baxter, saluting him as a promoter and pattern of piety. He was supported by a grant of &pound;20 from the Presbyterian Fund in 1691, probably for his last year of study. He was recorded about this time in the Common Fund Survey as willing to settle in Denbighshire if a maintenance might be had. He assisted his brother at Wrexham, who gave oversight to the Presbyterian congregation there. As a result he received a grant of &pound;6 a year in 1695 and 1696 from the Presbyterian Fund. In August 1696 the Cheshire classis approved of his preaching at Warrington on trial and the congregation unanimously chose him in succession to Peter Aspinwall, who had died in June 1696. He prepared students for the ministry, though because the numbers were small and he was not supported by the Presbyterian Fund, he may have taught them privately. He quit teaching temporarily as a result of the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span> in 1714. Job Orton was a student for a year in 1733, but the names of only a handful of other students are known.<br>
<br>Owen was a vigorous though controversial defender of dissent and of the Hanoverian succession. He published anonymously a violent funeral sermon on the death of Queen Anne, <span class="italic">Ahabs Evil</span> (1714). His <span class="italic">Plain Dealing, or, Separation without Schism</span> (1715; 12th edn, 1727), in which he attacked the high-church zealots and defended dissenters and the &#145;moderate and genuine sons of the Church of England&#146;  (C. Owen, <span class="italic">Plain Dealing</span>, 2nd edn, 1715, 3), was even more notorious. He was answered by <span class="italic">Plain Dealing Proved to be Plain Lying</span> (1715), and replied in turn with a <span class="italic">Vindication of Plain Dealing, from the Base and Malicious Aspersions of Two Country Curates</span> (1716), a particularly rancorous work. The work was presented to the grand jury as reflecting scandalously on the Church of England and its clergy and a bill found against him. He obtained a <i>nolle prosequi</i> but suffered heavy costs. The Presbyterian Fund made him a special grant of &pound;25 in January 1716.<br>
<br>Owen's most important works were in defence of dissent. In his <span class="italic">Donatus redivivus</span> (1714), reprinted in 1716 as <span class="italic">Rebaptization Condemned</span>, he attacked the Church of England's practice of rebaptizing dissenters who conformed, provoking several replies. His <span class="italic">Amazon Disarm'd</span> (1714) was in answer to Jane Chorlton's reply to <span class="italic">Donatus redivius</span>. He also had an active part in the major high-church controversy over the validity of Presbyterian ordination, publishing first <span class="italic">Validity of the Dissenting Ministry</span> (1716), edited from the works of his brother, and then his own <span class="italic">The Dissenting Ministry Still Valid in Answer to some Scurrilous Reflections</span> (1717). His <span class="italic">Plain Reasons</span> (1715; 23rd edn, 1736) defended dissenters from the charge of schism. In connection with the campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> he published <span class="italic">Dissenters Claim of Right to a Capacity for Civil Offices</span> (1717). His <span class="italic">Jure Divino Woe</span> (1717) attacked the Jacobite rebels and <span class="italic">Alarm to the Protestant Princes and People</span> (1728) condemned the cruel behaviour of continental Catholics. In contrast, <span class="italic">Danger of Church and State from Foreigners</span> (1750) was an open-minded plea to fellow Britons to recognize the contribution of foreigners. He also wrote a number of devotional works&#151;<span class="italic">Hymns Sacred to the Lord's Table</span> (1712), <span class="italic">The Wonders of Redeeming Love</span> (1723), a work on redemption, and <span class="italic">Religious Gratitude</span> (1731), all of which disclose a warm evangelicalism. He attacked the charismatic excesses of the French prophets and their English followers in <span class="italic">Scene of Delusions Opened</span> (1712). His remarkable <span class="italic">Essay on Serpents</span> (1742), dedicated to Sir Hans Sloane, reveals an extraordinary depth of knowledge and reading. He received a DD from Edinburgh University with Isaac Watts in 1728. He published a number of funeral sermons, including one for Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, whom he compared with Samuel.<br>
<br>Owen maintained a successful and popular ministry at Warrington for nearly fifty years. A meeting-house was built in 1703 which was replaced by a new building the year he died. According to the <span class="roman">Evans List</span> (1715&#150;17) Owen had the largest and most important congregation in that part of Lancashire with 713 hearers and 82 county voters. He was a member of both the Cheshire and the Warrington classes, and acted as moderator for both on many occasions. He was married but nothing about his wife is known. He died in Warrington on 17 February 1746 and was buried in his meeting-house in Cairo Street, Warrington. His nephew, Josiah Owen, preached his funeral sermon. His son John (<i>d</i>. 1775) was nonconformist minister at Wharton, Lancashire.<br>
