<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacDonald,  Margaret Ethel Gladstone</span>  (1870&#150;1911), <span class="occ">socialist and feminist</span>, was born on 20 July 1870 at 17 Pembridge Square, London, the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33418/', "John Hall Gladstone (1827&#150;1902)")</script>, professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution, and his second wife, Margaret Thompson King (<i>d</i>. 1870), daughter of a Presbyterian minister and niece of Lord Kelvin. Margaret's mother died soon after her birth and she was brought up with half-sisters from her father's previous marriage in a religious and socially aware household. John Gladstone was a committed Liberal who served on the London school board for twenty-one years and was a founder member of the Young Men's Christian Association. Margaret Gladstone was educated at the Doreck College for Girls in Bayswater and the women's department of King's College and studied political economy under Millicent Fawcett. She was attracted to evangelicalism and taught a weekly class for servant girls at the Nassau Senior Training Home when she was seventeen. In 1889 she took Sunday school classes for boys and worked in boys' clubs. By the age of twenty-three she had become manager for several board schools, secretary of the Hoxton and Haggerston Nursing Association, and a visitor for the Charity Organization Society in Hoxton.<br>
<br>This was a common pattern of activities for young women who wished to lead purposeful lives. In Margaret Gladstone's case, however, contact with working-class poverty led to more radical political ideas. Initially influenced by the Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and F. D. Maurice, she was drawn further towards socialist politics in the 1890s by the speeches of the trade union leader Ben Tillett and by reading <span class="italic">Fabian Essays</span> (1893). Her work for the Charity Organization Society and the influence of an old schoolfriend, Lily Montagu, the organizer of the West London Jewish Girls' Clubs, brought her into contact with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96080', "Women's Industrial Council (WIC)")</script>, a body which investigated women's working conditions and promoted policies to improve them. Inspired by Amelia Jane (Amie) Hicks and Mrs Hogg, both active members of the WIC, she acknowledged by 1895 that she was now a socialist. It was in the same year that she met her future husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34704/', "(James) Ramsay MacDonald (1866&#150;1937)")</script>, who, after her death, was to become the first Labour prime minister. Margaret Gladstone joined the Independent Labour Party in April 1896 and was married in November of the same year. The MacDonalds set up home at 3 Lincoln's Inn Fields which became a centre for labour activists at home and from abroad. They had three daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107105/', "Ishbel MacDonald")</script>, political hostess and local politician, and three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31388/', "Malcolm John MacDonald")</script>, and David, who died in 1910.<br>
<br>Margaret MacDonald had a private income of &pound;460 a year and is most often remembered for the financial and emotional support and security that she gave to her husband. However, the importance of her own contribution to the labour movement has come to be recognized. She was one of a small group of middle-class women who concentrated on improving the lives of female industrial workers. The Women's Industrial Council, which she joined in 1894, provided a focus for her activities. She was secretary of the council's legal and statistical committee, and a member of its investigations and education committees. On behalf of the WIC she carried out investigations into home working in London, the results of which were published in 1897, and gave evidence to the 1906 select committee on home work. She helped to produce a series of studies on women workers, one of which, <span class="italic">Women in the Printing Trades</span> (1904), was edited by her husband. In the early 1900s Margaret MacDonald drew attention to the needs of unemployed women. Through her efforts the central unemployment board of London appointed a special women's work committee which established municipal workrooms for clothing workers. She helped to organize a march of unemployed women in Whitehall in 1905 and in 1907 initiated a national conference on the unemployment of women dependent on their own earnings. In the same year she gave evidence to the royal commission on the poor laws and provided a memorandum on women's unemployment. Industrial education for women and girls was another interest of Margaret MacDonald. She was partly responsible for the decision of the London county council to establish the first trade school for girls at the Borough Polytechnic in 1904 and organized national conferences on the industrial training of women and girls in 1907 and 1908.<br>
<br>Alongside her work for the WIC Margaret MacDonald also took an active part in the National Union of Women Workers. As chairman of the industrial committee and secretary of the legislation committee she was involved in a wide range of issues including housing, the registration of midwives and nurses, the early closing of shops, and the appointment of women probation officers. She gave many lectures on these subjects, and between 1899 and 1909 wrote most of the industrial section of the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Year Book</span>. One of her last campaigns was to attempt to gain better terms for women under the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span> of 1911 by urging Lloyd George to include non-working wives and married home workers. In the last few years of her life Margaret MacDonald was president of a new organization, the Women's Labour League, which was established in 1906 to encourage women to become involved in Labour politics and to seek improvements in the work and family lives of working-class women. Margaret MacDonald supported women's enfranchisement from an adult suffrage position, but was never willing to give the issue priority. Despite her long-standing interest in working conditions, and her own attempts to combine motherhood and public activities, she believed that women's most important role was in the home and she was consistent in her opposition to married women's paid employment.<br>
<br>With so many causes to pursue and several young children to bring up it is little wonder that Margaret MacDonald's life at Lincoln's Inn Fields was chaotic. Margaret Bondfield, the trade union leader and socialist, recalled that she would beg Margaret MacDonald: &#145;Come back to my rooms, then I can be sure of getting your attention! What with babies, telephones and callers, etc. &hellip; it is impossible at your home&#146;  (Collette, 44). Margaret MacDonald was eulogized by her husband in a sentimental memoir published in 1912, but other contemporaries remembered her as a strong-minded campaigner who could be tenacious in her opinions. Her opposition to the <span class="roman">Trade Board Bill</span>, which would have set a minimum wage for home workers, led to a fundamental disagreement between herself and Clementina Black, president of the WIC, which split the council. Margaret MacDonald's involvement in the relationship between George Belt, a married organizer for the Independent Labour Party, and Dora Montefiore, a wealthy socialist and suffragist, in which she was sued for libel, showed a moralistic side to her character which was also revealed in her crusade to abolish the employment of women as barmaids.<br>
<br>Margaret MacDonald died unexpectedly, aged forty-one, on 8 September 1911 at her home, 3 Lincoln's Inn Fields, from blood poisoning due to an internal ulcer. Overwork and stress were thought to have contributed to her early death. After months of controversy, she had been obliged to sever her connections with the Women's Industrial Council, and this caused her acute distress. Services were conducted on 12 September at her home and at Golders Green crematorium, where she was cremated. Two services were also held for her at Leicester (where her husband had his parliamentary seat) and her ashes were buried at Spynie churchyard near Lossiemouth. Three memorials were created: a baby clinic was set up in her memory at North Kensington and a new ward was named after her at Leicester Children's Hospital by the Women's Labour League; a bronze statue, designed by her husband, was unveiled in Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 19 December 1914.<br>
