<span class="headword">Pennyman, Sir  William</span>, baronet  (1606/7&#150;1643), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the eldest son of William Pennyman of St Albans, Hertfordshire (an illegitimate son of James Pennyman of Ormesby, Yorkshire), and of his wife, Anne (either <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tottle or <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aske). William Pennyman the elder was one of the six clerks in chancery, and on 28 June 1610 obtained a grant with George Evelyn of the office of comptroller and clerk of the hanaper. He died in 1628. William Pennyman the younger was educated at Westminster School, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 31 October 1623, aged sixteen, and was admitted a student of the Inner Temple in the same year. He was created a baronet on 6 May 1628, and was married to Anne Atherton (<i>c</i>.1609&#150;1644) by January 1634. Pennyman succeeded to large estates in Yorkshire, acted as sheriff of the county in 1635&#150;6, and was recommended by Strafford, in April 1637, for the post of <i>custos rotulorum</i> of the North Riding, on the ground of his integrity and good affection to the king's service &#145;which he hath given very good testimonies of in all the commissions he is employed on, as Deputy-Lieutenant, one of the Council of those parts, and as Justice of Oyer and Terminer and of the Peace&#146;. He was an associate of Strafford in exploiting the Yorkshire alum mines in the 1630s. In December 1638 he purchased an office in the Star Chamber, worth &pound;2000 per annum and became a bencher of Gray's Inn in 1639. During the two bishops' wars (1639, 1640) he commanded a regiment of the Yorkshire trained bands, and represented Richmond in the two parliaments called in 1640.<br>
<br>Pennyman was one of the witnesses called at Strafford's trial to testify to the earl's conduct concerning the Yorkshire petition, to the illegal levy of money to support the Yorkshire trained bands (for which Pennyman had been questioned in the Commons in December 1640), to Strafford's boast that he would make the little finger of the king heavier than the loins of the law, and to the crucial charge of planning to deploy the Irish army in England. He showed great reluctance to depose to anything against Strafford, and ultimately cast his vote against the bill for Strafford's attainder with fifty-eight other members.<br>
<br>Having lost office through parliament's abolition of Star Chamber, it was inaccurately reported in December 1641 that Pennyman would be appointed a treasurer of the navy. In April 1642 he accompanied Charles I in his bid to regain control of Hull and subsequently raised a troop of horse and a regiment of six hundred foot for the king, and joined him at Nottingham by 30 July 1642. He was disabled from sitting in the Commons on 11 August following.<br>
<br>Pennyman fought at Edgehill, and in April 1643 was appointed governor of Oxford in succession to Sir Jacob Astley. He fell a victim to the epidemic which prevailed in Oxford in the summer of 1643, died there on 22 August, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral. His widow died on 13 July 1644, and was buried in the same grave as her husband; they left no children.<br>
