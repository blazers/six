<span class="headword">Hogg, Sir  James Weir</span>, first baronet  (1790&#150;1876), <span class="occ">director and chairman of the East India Company</span>, was born at Stoneyford, near Lisburn, co. Antrim, on 7 September 1790, the elder son of William Hogg (1754&#150;1824), of Belmont, co. Antrim, and his wife, Mary, daughter of James Dickey of Dunmore, co. Antrim. He received his early education at Dr Bruce's academy in Belfast and in 1808 was elected a scholar of Trinity College, Dublin. There he gained the gold medal for oratory and graduated BA in 1810. In 1811 he entered Gray's Inn, London, in order to qualify for the Irish bar.<br>
<br>In 1814, upon being admitted as a barrister at the King's Inns in Dublin, Hogg sailed for Calcutta and over the next eight years built up an exceptionally lucrative law practice. On 26 July 1822 he married Mary Claudine (<i>d</i>. 1874), second daughter of Samuel Swinton of Swinton, Berwickshire, a Bengal civil servant. Also in 1822 he accepted the office of registrar of the supreme court of Calcutta, which post he held until 1833, when he returned to Britain with a large fortune.<br>
<br>In 1835 Hogg was elected for Beverley as a Conservative. He continued to represent Beverley until 1847, when he was returned unopposed for Honiton, a seat which he held until narrowly defeated in the general election of March 1857. Throughout his parliamentary career Hogg resolutely supported Sir Robert Peel and his free-trade policies and in June 1846, shortly before leaving office, Peel repaid his loyalty with a baronetcy.<br>
<br>In September 1839 Hogg was elected a director of the East India Company and thereafter functioned as the <i>de facto</i> representative of Leadenhall Street in the House of Commons. Indeed, although he enjoyed a reputation as an excellent orator, he rarely spoke in the house except on Indian matters. He so valued his connection with the company that in 1845 he turned down Peel's offer of the post of judge-advocate-general rather than surrender his position as deputy chairman. In all he was deputy chairman of the company in 1845&#150;6, 1850&#150;51, and 1851&#150;2, and chairman in 1846&#150;7 and 1852&#150;3. In these roles he robustly defended the much criticized system of the dual government of India and, in his insistence on the independence and political integrity of the court of directors, generated considerable friction with the Board of Control, especially during the second presidency (1846&#150;52) of John Cam Hobhouse.<br>
<br>As both a prominent director and an MP, Hogg was subject to frequent attacks by the company's critics, most notably Sir Charles Napier. Unlike many Conservatives, Hogg was not averse to all acquisitions of new territory in India (for example, he approved of Dalhousie's annexation of Nagpur in 1854), but he deplored Napier's self-propelled conquest of Sind and was further outraged by Napier's publicly expressed scorn for the directors and their servants in India. For his part, Napier freely criticized Hogg in the press, especially in a savage letter published in <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and <span class="italic">The Times</span> in October 1848, to which Hogg responded in turn by encouraging the court to resist parliamentary pressure to install Napier as commander-in-chief in India.<br>
<br>In 1853 Hogg declined the governorship of Bombay. After his defeat in 1857 he made no attempt to re-enter parliament, but in 1858 under the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> he took a seat as one of seven former directors on the new Council of India. He remained on the council (serving as vice-president in 1860) until his retirement in early 1872, the year also in which he was sworn a member of the privy council.<br>
<br>Hogg died at his home, 11 Grosvenor Crescent, London, on 27 May 1876, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His wife, mother to their seven sons and seven daughters, had died two years earlier. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13472/', "Lieutenant-Colonel Sir James Macnaghten McGarel Hogg, afterwards first Lord Magheramorne (1823&#150;1890)")</script>, succeeded Hogg in the baronetcy. Their seventh son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33926/', "Quintin Hogg")</script>, became a successful merchant and philanthropist.<br>
