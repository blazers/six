<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colebrooke,  Henry Thomas</span>  (1765&#150;1837), <span class="occ">administrator in India and scholar</span>, was born in London on 15 June 1765, youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37301/', "Sir George Colebrooke, second baronet (1729&#150;1809)")</script>, banker and for four years chairman of the East India Company (1769&#150;73), and his wife, Mary, daughter of Patrick Gaynor of Antigua. When Henry was twelve, his father was ruined and went to live in France for several years. Nevertheless, he used his connections to gain employment for his two youngest sons with the East India Company, and Henry was appointed a writer. Henry was educated by a tutor at home in London but only until he was fifteen. He evidently excelled both in languages and in mathematics, but appears to have been largely self-taught. A sister remembered that as a boy he showed interest in joining the church, but no such inclination is discernible in what is known of his adult life.<h2>
<a name="Administrativecareer"></a>Administrative career</h2>Colebrooke set sail for India in 1782 and reached Calcutta in 1783. On arrival in India he had to wait three years for a post. In 1786 he was appointed assistant collector in Tirhut; in 1789 he was transferred to the same post in Purnea; in 1793 he was transferred to Nator. In 1794, on the death of Sir William Jones, he took over the responsibility for making a digest of Hindu law, and this led to his transfer to the judicial branch of the company's service. In 1795 he was appointed magistrate in Mirzapur, near Benares. In 1798 he was temporarily moved to the diplomatic service and appointed resident at Nagpur; he arrived there in March 1799. His mission was to talk the raja of Berar into concluding a treaty with the British. He stayed two years but political shifts elsewhere in India rendered his mission hopeless; nevertheless, Lord Wellesley, the governor-general, congratulated him on his efforts. Soon after his return to Mirzapur in 1801 he was transferred to Calcutta as one of the first members of the superior court of appeal; in 1805 he headed it as chief justice.<br>
<br>In 1807 Colebrooke was at last promoted to a seat on the supreme council. He held this position for the usual five years under Lord Minto's administration, but left it in disfavour with the company's directors in London. He returned for six months to the superior court of appeal and was then appointed a member of the board of revenue. He left India for England in December 1814.<br>
<br>In 1810 in Calcutta he met and married Elizabeth Wilkinson (1784/5&#150;1814). He intended to retire with her to England as soon as possible, but was delayed by litigation. The couple had three sons, of whom one died in infancy; then, in October 1814, his wife died at the age of twenty-nine, and he returned to England alone. He also had a daughter and a son before he married; who their mother was is not recorded. The only son to survive him, and to marry, was Sir Thomas Edward Colebrooke, who became his biographer. Quotations below are from that biography, <span class="italic">The Life of H. T. Colebrooke</span> (1873); its bibliography lists Colebrooke's publications.<h2>
<a name="Scholarlyrange"></a>Scholarly range</h2>His son justly remarks that Colebrooke's life &#145;was noted for the pursuit of severe and abstract studies, rarely exceeded by the resident at an University or the inmate of a cloister&#146;  (Colebrooke, 12). The learning Colebrooke acquired and the publications he produced in the interstices of an extremely busy career, pursued under the rigours of the Indian climate, seem quite beyond the scope of what a comfortable professional academic might achieve in the late twentieth century. What the son's assessment omits, however, is the sheer breadth of Colebrooke's interests and knowledge. With his pre-eminence in &#145;abstract studies&#146; he combined expertise on many practical topics; indeed, perhaps only the visual arts were missing from his repertoire. Though it is his contributions to the humanities which have been the most enduring, he probably devoted as much attention to science, technology, and realia.<br>
<br>A historian is bound to see Colebrooke as a kind of successor to the orientalist Sir William Jones. He arrived in Calcutta the year before Jones and others founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He published twenty papers in <span class="italic">Asiatic Researches</span>, the journal of that society, and became its president in 1807. Back in Britain he took the lead in founding the parallel society in London. Like Jones, he became involved in studying, and trying to codify, Hindu (Brahmanical) law because he had to apply it in court. Also like Jones, his political opinions were strongly liberal. Both men purchased property in America with the idea of retiring to a freer political climate than that of Britain&#151;though neither achieved that goal. Equally impressive in their intellectual range, both are now remembered primarily for their Indology. Max M&uuml;ller called Colebrooke &#145;founder and father of the Sanskrit scholarship in Europe&#146;. Colebrooke's son has admirably summarized both how they complement each other and why his father remained the less well known. Jones was &#145;imaginative and inventive, powerful in illustration, always eager to trace analogies&#146;, so that his writings are &#145;attractive as well as instructive&#146;. Colebrooke aimed, by contrast,<blockquote>to examine and record facts with the rigour of a student of physical science, and to lay down the results of [his] inquiries with a method necessarily dry, but affording a storehouse of important observations for future students. Mr. Colebrooke's comments, or general remarks, are few but weighty, and put forward with a caution that may be regarded as excessive, and render his writings unattractive to the general reader. (Colebrooke, 235)</blockquote>The torch which Colebrooke received from Jones he passed on to Horace Hayman Wilson. In 1827 Colebrooke wrote to Wilson (who was still in India):<blockquote>Careless and indifferent as our countrymen are, I think, nevertheless, you and I may derive more complacent feelings from the reflection that, following the footsteps of Sir W. Jones, we have, with so little aid of collaborators, and so little encouragement, opened nearly every avenue, and left it to foreigners, who are taking up the clue we have furnished, to complete the outline of what we have sketched. It is some gratification to natural pride that the opportunity which the English have enjoyed has not been wholly unemployed.</blockquote>On Colebrooke's death Wilson succeeded him as director of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Naturalhistory"></a>Natural history</h2>The first book Colebrooke wrote (though not alone) was privately printed in 1795 as <span class="italic">Remarks on the Present State of Husbandry and Commerce in Bengal</span>. Because of his support for free trade it could not then be published in London; when William Pitt had read it, Colebrooke was told he was lucky not to be dismissed from the service. But his part of the book was later recognized as a mine of information and republished. Another early publication was an article &#145;On Indian weights and measures&#146;. &#145;Every branch of natural history attracted him, and he would say that the wonders revealed by the microscope were far more interesting than those of the telescope&#146;  (Colebrooke, 266). To see this remark in perspective one must be aware that Colebrooke became the second president of the Astronomical Society in 1824, succeeding Sir William Herschel. After retirement he even had his own chemical laboratory. In India he published articles on the gayal and &#145;On olibanum, or frankincense&#146;, and collected minerals and botanical specimens. In botany, &#145;an especially favourite study&#146;, he annotated Jones's posthumously published treatise on Indian plants, and a genus of Didynamia Gymnospermia was named <i>Colebrookia</i> in his honour.<br>
<br>Colebrooke took a keen interest in the exploration and surveying of the Himalayas, which he liked to call &#145;my mountains&#146;. Jones had already written that they were the highest mountains in the world; Colebrooke estimated their height at 26,000 feet and asked for this to be checked. He corresponded with Lieutenant Webb, who had established that the Ganges rose in India (not, as previously thought, in Tibet), and in 1810 communicated this discovery to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. After leaving India he also published a paper on the height of the snow line, as well as papers on topics in oceanography, geology, and climatology.<br>
<br>His son wrote:<blockquote>Nothing came amiss to him; he amassed a large store of miscellaneous information, so that those who, in later life, sought for works to amuse him, were often impressed with the extent of his reading in lighter literature. On two occasions in India &hellip; he applied himself to the surgeon's library, and acquired a very creditable knowledge of the general principles of surgery and medicine. (Colebrooke, 265)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="StudiesofSanskrit"></a>Studies of Sanskrit</h2>It was Colebrooke's interest in mathematics and astronomy, his son claims, that gave him the initial impetus to learn Sanskrit. In a letter to his father in 1786 he writes, &#145;What leisure I find for study shall be given to Arabic, by which alone an accurate knowledge of Persian can be obtained&#146;, but in another letter shortly afterwards he reveals detailed knowledge of not only Arabic but also Sanskrit modes of time-reckoning. In 1807 he published <span class="italic">On the Indian and Arabic Divisions of the Zodiac</span>; in 1816 <span class="italic">On the notions of the Hindu astronomers concerning the precession of the equinoxes and motions of the planets</span>. Most of his knowledge of Sanskrit astronomy (<i>jyotihshastra</i>), however, remained unpublished, and has to be gleaned from his annotations on the Sanskrit manuscripts in the field which are now in the British Library. Colebrooke's study of Indian mathematics is his most enduring achievement; his editions and translations of Sanskrit mathematical works remain fundamental for any student of the subject.<br>
<br>In 1801 he was appointed honorary professor of Hindu law and Sanskrit at Fort William College, recently established in Calcutta. He did not teach, but examined in Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, and Bengali. The author of an Arabic grammar, Lieutenant Baillie, repeatedly thanked Colebrooke for advice and assistance. Colebrooke initiated an imaginative but unsuccessful project to assemble vocabularies of all the languages spoken between Persia and China. His most impressive linguistic enterprise, however, was his <span class="italic">Grammar of the Sanscrit Language</span>, vol. 1 (1805, though a rare shorter version appeared in 1804), the first European work to be based on the indigenous linguistic tradition. William Jones had said that Panini's grammar, the root of that tradition, was &#145;so abstruse as to require the lucubration of many years before it can be perfectly understood&#146;  (Colebrooke, 193). Colebrooke supplied that lucubration. His preface showed that he appreciated the unique importance of Panini for the study of Sanskrit and its culture. Unfortunately he never finished the second volume, being discouraged by the greater popularity of the simpler grammars which were being published on the Latin model familiar to Europeans. Nevertheless, Colebrooke's volume stands as a monument marking the beginning of the study of traditional Sanskrit linguistics (<i>vyakarana</i>) by non-Indians, and in due course that study was to bring <i>vyakarana</i> into the global development of linguistics.<br>
<br>Colebrooke had published for the first time two Sanskrit lexicons, Hemacandra's <span class="italic">Abhidhana cintamani</span> and the <span class="italic">Amarakosa</span>. In <span class="italic">On the Sanscrit and Pracrit Languages</span> he traced the history of what are nowadays known as the Indo-Aryan languages. His long article &#145;On Sanscrit and Pracrit poetry&#146;, with its &#145;Synoptical tables of Indian prosody&#146;, is a compilation of information on metrics from Vedic to medieval literature which has yet to be surpassed. This article alone contains, albeit with Colebrooke's typical condensation, as much material as one would hope to find in a modern doctoral dissertation. He took considerable interest in Indian history, and five published papers concern inscriptions.<h2>
<a name="Lawreligionandphilosophy"></a>Law, religion, and philosophy</h2>Jones had proposed to compile a digest of both Hindu and Muslim law, but when he died in 1794 all that existed of this enterprise was a voluminous compilation in Sanskrit by a pandit, Jagannatha, of Brahman law on inheritance and contract. Colebrooke undertook to translate this into English and hoped to do so in six months, working part-time; in fact it took him two years and was published (in 1798) in four volumes. In 1801, when he joined the superior court of appeal, he had the court's decisions embodied in reports. He published further books on inheritance in 1810 and on contracts in 1818. He wrote in 1822 that he had prepared a &#145;Supplementary Digest&#146; in Sanskrit and English, but found it &#145;very little called for&#146;. The only publication to result from this work was his essay &#145;On Hindu courts of justice&#146; (1828), the last Indological work published during his lifetime. He corresponded often and at length with Sir Thomas Strange, chief justice at Madras, about the latter's book on Hindu law, and many of his remarks are included in it.<br>
<br>Colebrooke did great pioneer work on ancient Indian religion and philosophy. He wrote on all the major classical schools of Indian philosophy, though his translation of the <span class="roman">Samkhya karika</span> was published after his death. He published an article (long enough to be called a monograph) on the Vedas (1805), and a series of three articles (1798&#150;1801) entitled &#145;On the religious ceremonies of the Hindus, and of the brahmins especially&#146;. Astonishingly, in the same period he published &#145;On the origin and peculiar tenets of certain Mohammedan sects&#146; (1801). His earliest published article (1795) was &#145;On the duties of a faithful Hindu widow&#146;. It quotes Sanskrit texts on a widow's duty to be burnt with her husband's body, adding that this was rarely done. When he was on the supreme council the government considered for the first time whether to suppress the custom: Colebrooke advised that to forbid it would be counter-productive and favoured regulation to ensure that the widow acted voluntarily.<br>
<br>His &#145;Observation on the sect of Jains&#146; (1807) was the first significant contribution ever made by a non-Indian to knowledge of that religion; it is based on original Prakrit texts. Unlike his predecessors, he clearly distinguished Jainism from Buddhism, and speculated intelligently, albeit incorrectly, on the relation between them. Though he never devoted a publication to Buddhism, he was planning to do so in 1804, when he wrote to his father: &#145;I have lately obtained a considerable addition of authentic and important information on the religion and mythology of the Buddhists. Everything relative to a religion, which has spread even more widely than the Christian or the Mahomedan faiths, is particularly interesting&#146;  (Colebrooke, 217). He later refuted the theory that Buddhism had preceded Brahmanism, showing that Vedic literature was pre-Buddhist.<h2>
<a name="Benefactor"></a>Benefactor</h2>Colebrooke was the individual who played the greatest part in founding and establishing the (later Royal) Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. He took the chair at all the preliminary meetings; the first, on 9 January 1823, was held at his house. It was evidently felt that the president should be someone of higher rank and greater influence; but it was unanimously decided to appoint, immediately below the president, a director, &#145;under whose particular care and protection Asiatic literature should be placed&#146;. In this capacity Colebrooke was &#145;called to the chair&#146; at the society's first general meeting on 15 March 1823. In his address he said that England had a special mission to repay a debt of gratitude to India. For the next three years he presided at most meetings both of the society and of its governing council; evidently it was he who really ran the society. His failing eyesight then limited his activity, but he remained director until his death. In 1824 he presented the society with drawings of Indian objects ranging from musical instruments to agricultural implements.<br>
<br>He had already presented, in 1819, his collection of 2749 Indian manuscripts to the library of the East India Company (later the India Office Library, now part of the British Library). This must at the time have been the largest collection of Indian manuscripts outside India. The vast majority of the manuscripts were in Sanskrit, but Prakrit, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, and Bengali were also represented. In recognition of this generosity the directors of the company commissioned from F. L. Chantrey a bust of Colebrooke which still stands in the library. The India Office Library was also indirectly benefited by Colebrooke when it inherited the library of Fort William College, Calcutta, which he had done much to form.<br>
<br>Colebrooke was &#145;small and spare in person&#146;  (Colebrooke, 383). Before his retirement he seems to have enjoyed good health. He was a strong walker, and when young was fond of hunting and other outdoor pursuits. To his son he appeared kind and yet rather formidable, perhaps with more intelligence than common sense. He enjoyed poetry and imaginative literature, but &#145;Tragic tales affected him so painfully that he generally shunned them&#146;  (ibid., 265). Though he had no small talk, he had an attractive dry wit: &#145;The Brahmins not inelegantly remarked of the occultation yesterday, that it was the emblem of the meeting between the Raja and his mother, which was, by the bye, to have taken place yesterday, but it did not; so that, it should seem, the planets were not informed of the postponement early enough&#146;  (ibid., 166).<br>
<br>Colebrooke's life was perhaps not very happy. In his early years in India he longed to leave; a free-trader employed by the East India Company was a misfit. On the supreme council he lost favour because he was associated with a decision to postpone remittances to London, after the heavy costs of a campaign against Java, and because he had favoured the unsuccessful attempt to institute a house tax in large towns. Never decorated, he felt unjustly treated. Anxious about money, he lost much of what he had made in India through unwise speculation; he bought land in the Cape of Good Hope and spent nearly a year there (1821&#150;2) but lost his investment. His health declined with his finances. His eyesight worsened and in 1829 he went completely blind. He then had terrible back pains. Between 1822 and 1834 he keenly suffered the deaths of two nieces to whom he was guardian and two sons, all as young adults. For the last three years he was bedridden. He died in London of influenza, or its after-effects, on 10 March 1837.<br>
