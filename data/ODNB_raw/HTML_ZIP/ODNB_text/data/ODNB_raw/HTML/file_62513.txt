<span class="headword">Campbell,  Victor Lindsey Arbuthnot</span>  (1875&#150;1956), <span class="occ">naval officer and Antarctic explorer</span>, was born on 20 August 1875 at 16 Adelaide Crescent, Hove, Sussex, son of Captain Hugh Campbell RN, commander of the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, and his wife, Lucy Eleanor Archer. Educated at Eton College, Victor Campbell is said to have run away three times before his father agreed to let him join the Merchant Navy  (Huxley, 274). He was subsequently admitted to the Royal Navy on 31 October 1895.<br>
<br>Commissioned acting sub-lieutenant, Campbell served in HMS <i>President</i> and HMS <i>Victory</i>, joining HMS <i>Cordelia</i> in March 1896, which brought him to Newfoundland, a place which left a lasting impression on him. In 1901 he resigned his commission and the following year married Lillian Mary Settle (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Major-General Sir Henry Hamilton Settle RE KCB DSO. Their son Nigel was born in 1903. Subsequently the family spent their summer months in Sand, Norway, where Campbell was introduced to the art of ski running, a skill which in due course was to serve him well in the Antarctic with Captain Scott. Then in 1909 tragedy struck when Campbell's sister-in-law was drowned in a boating accident in Sandefjord, an event which so affected his wife that the marriage began to founder. It seems likely that this event played some part in deciding Campbell to sign on with Scott's British Antarctic expedition in 1910 as first officer of SY <i>Terra Nova</i>.<br>
<br>An archetypal naval officer of his time, Campbell was dubbed &#145;the Wicked Mate&#146; by the ship's party, a nickname that implied the mixture of respect, awe, and affection with which he was regarded. Following his supervision of the landing of the stores at the expedition's base at Cape Evans, Ross Island, in January 1911, Campbell was selected by Scott to command a six-man eastern party to explore King Edward VII Land. They were to be landed there by <i>Terra Nova</i>, but in the event heavy ice frustrated this plan. On the return voyage Campbell and his men unexpectedly encountered the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen at the Bay of Whales planning the expedition to the south pole which was subsequently to defeat Scott. Following a brief exchange of news Campbell continued towards his second objective, Cape Adare, with what had now become the northern party, pausing only to leave news for Scott of Amundsen's intentions.<br>
<br>The story of the northern party is well recorded by one of its members, the geologist Raymond Priestley, in his book <span class="italic">Antarctic Adventure</span> (1914). More recently Campbell's own diaries were published as <span class="italic">The Wicked Mate</span> (1988). The other members included Surgeon-Commander G. Murray Levick, petty officers G. F. Browning and G. P. Abbott, and seaman A. B. H. Dickason. The party's objective was to carry out a scientific survey of the Cape Adare region, a frustrating mission since the topography of the area prohibited all access to the interior. Thanks to Campbell's capable leadership morale was maintained and some useful science accomplished. In January 1912 the northern party was picked up by <i>Terra Nova</i> and landed on ice-clad Inexpressible Island to geologize for six weeks. When the ship subsequently failed to relieve them Campbell and his men were compelled to overwinter in a hastily improvised snow cave 12 feet by 9 in area and 5&frac12; feet high. In it they managed to survive for seven months during one of the worst winters then on record, subsisting mainly on seal and penguin meat. That they survived was largely due to Campbell's leadership. His word was law. To maintain discipline he drew an imaginary line bisecting the cave, one half of which was the &#145;messdeck&#146;, the other the &#145;quarterdeck&#146;. Thus nothing could be officially heard in one half that had been spoken in the other. At last on 30 September 1912 the northern party set off for Cape Evans; they traversed a distance of 230 miles over hazardous crevassed terrain and reached base camp on 6 November 1912. Here they learned of the deaths of the pole party. Campbell then took over the command pending their final relief by <i>Terra Nova</i> in January 1913.<br>
<br>Back in London the death of Scott and his companions overshadowed the sufferings and remarkable survival of the northern party. Campbell, ever reticent, was content to receive a gold watch from the Royal Geographical Society and the praise of its president, Lord Curzon, for whom &#145;no more brilliant thing has ever been accomplished in the history of Arctic and Antarctic exploration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wicked Mate</span>, 12). In 1913 he was raised to the rank of commander for his part in the expedition. During the summer of 1914 he was employed by the Northern Exploration Company to lead a mineral prospecting expedition to Spitsbergen, but this was abruptly terminated by the outbreak of war. His wartime career was exemplary. He saw action in the Dardanelles and was awarded the DSO to which a bar was subsequently added for service in the Dover patrol. In 1918, aboard HMS <i>Warwick</i>, he took part in the Zeebrugge raid and in 1919 was appointed OBE for service in north Russia. Following further commands in the Atlantic Fleet he was promoted captain in 1922, before retiring to his beloved Newfoundland.<br>
<br>In 1926 Campbell's wife, Lillian, divorced him, and two years later he married Marit Fabritious, daughter of a Norwegian artist and a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Maud of Norway. During the Second World War he served for a time as senior naval officer, Trinidad, returning to Newfoundland in 1941 to live in the settlement of Black Duck on the west coast. He finally retired to neighbouring Corner Brook where he died on 19 November 1956 and where he was buried with full military honours. A neighbour once described Campbell as &#145;the finest of a fine breed, so modest and yet with some quality about him so that you would follow him anywhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wicked Mate</span>, 14). His contribution to Scott's last expedition has undoubtedly been much underestimated.<br>
