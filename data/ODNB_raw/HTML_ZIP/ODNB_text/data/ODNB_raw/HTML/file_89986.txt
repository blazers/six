<span class="headword">Redgrave, Sir  Michael Scudamore</span>  (1908&#150;1985), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 20 March 1908 in theatrical lodgings at St Michael's Hill, Bristol, the only child of George Elsworthy (Roy) Redgrave (1873&#150;1922), actor, a specialist in melodrama, and his second wife, Margaret (Daisy) Scudamore (1884&#150;1958), actress, daughter of Fortunatus Augustin Scudamore, dramatist. Sixteen months after his birth his mother took him for a short time to Australia where his father was acting. Three years later his parents were divorced. In 1922 his mother, who looked after him, married J. P. Anderson, who had formerly been employed by the Ceylon and Eastern Agency in Ceylon. They had a daughter, Peggy, a half-sister to Michael.<br>
<br>Michael Redgrave went to Clifton College, Bristol, where he became a competent schoolboy player in male and female parts. His Macbeth, at seventeen, made his mother, who had been opposed to this, think twice about him becoming a professional actor. In 1927 he went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to study medieval and modern languages, and English. He undertook much undergraduate acting and wrote for and edited university magazines before graduating in 1931. He then went to Cranleigh School, Surrey, as modern languages master. Here, in effect, he was an actor&#150;manager, doing six productions and playing, among other parts, Samson Agonistes, Hamlet, and Lear; moreover he was given work in the semi-professional Guildford repertory company, which was glad to have a recruit so accomplished and personable: he was 6 feet 3 inches tall and strikingly handsome. Confidently he resigned from Cranleigh and got an audition from Lilian Baylis of the Old Vic, who offered him a contract at &pound;3 a week. Before accepting, he had an interview with William Armstrong, the director of Liverpool Playhouse, who persuaded him to go there; between 1934 and 1936 he had a wide variety of parts in the most sympathetic circumstances.<br>
<br>More important to him, Redgrave fell in love with Rachel Kempson [<i>see below</i>] when they acted together in John Van Druten's <span class="italic">The Flowers of the Forest</span>. They were married in the chapel of the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth (Rachel Kempson's father was its headmaster) on 18 July 1935 and for another year remained at Liverpool. It was then that Tyrone Guthrie, who was becoming one of the principal directors of his time, invited them for a season at the Old Vic where in September 1936 they opened as Ferdinand of Navarre and the Princess of France in <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span>. In 1936&#150;7 Redgrave was Horner in <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span> (with the American actress Ruth Gordon) and, to his delight, Orlando in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> to the Rosalind of Edith Evans, then forty-eight but, with her unerring sense of comedy, ready for the adventure. At once they were attracted to each other, an association they sustained during the Old Vic run and a transference for three months to what was then the New Theatre. Before then Redgrave had another rich experience, Laertes to Laurence Olivier's vigorous Hamlet. A daughter, Vanessa, was born to Redgrave and Rachel in January 1937. They later had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103173/', "Corin Redgrave (1939&#150;2010)")</script>, and another daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103174/', "Lynn Redgrave (1943&#150;2010)")</script>. All three became well-known actors. His son later wrote a book about his father, in which he revealed that despite his marriage, Redgrave had a number of homosexual relationships in his later life. Corin Redgrave commented that &#145;My father was bisexual. He wanted to write about it but never managed to&#146;  (C. Redgrave, 4).<br>
<br>Even after so brief a time in London, it was clear that Redgrave would be an important player; recognizing this, John Gielgud gave him several parts (including Tusenbach in <span class="italic">Three Sisters</span>) in a season at the Queen's Theatre (1937&#150;8). Work came easily. When he played, surprisingly, Sir Andrew Aguecheek during a production of <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> in the West End in 1938, the drama critic James Agate called him &#145;a giddy, witty maypole&#146;. At the Westminster Theatre in 1939 he was the first Harry Monchensey in T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span>, and he had also, inevitably but reluctantly, gone into films: Alfred Hitchcock cast him in <span class="italic">The Lady Vanishes</span> (1939). With the outbreak of war he had to abandon an Old Vic opportunity; instead, during 1940, he acted and sang Macheath in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at the Haymarket Theatre; later, at a small Kensington theatre and in the West End, he appeared most sensitively as the idealistic recluse of Robert Ardrey's <span class="italic">Thunder Rock</span>.<br>
<br>Redgrave's call-up papers reached him in June 1941 as he was in the middle of making a film and he found himself, as an ordinary seaman, training in devastated Plymouth. Discharged after a year for medical reasons, he returned to the stage in a sequence of plays, some as successful as Turgenev's <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span> (he was Rakitin in 1943) and an American melodrama, <span class="italic">Uncle Harry</span> (1944), in which he acted with exciting nervous power. Curiously in 1947 he appeared to be out of key in an elaborate production of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Another good spell was coming: first, the relentless tragedy of Strindberg's <span class="italic">The Father</span> (1948&#150;9), then a long season with the Old Vic Company at the New Theatre (its final period before going back to Waterloo Road). Redgrave ended with Hamlet (1950), a performance which lacked only the final quality of excitement: as a disciple of Konstantin Stanislavsky he was apt to concentrate upon a close dissection of the text. From that he went to Stratford upon Avon for a pair of remarkable performances, an intellectually searching Richard II (1951) in which he did not disguise the man's sexual ambiguity, and a Hotspur, grandly direct, with a precise Northumbrian accent. That summer he also played Prospero and the <span class="italic">Henry V</span> Chorus. In 1952, at the St James's, he was admirable in <span class="italic">Winter Journey</span>, Clifford Odets's American drama, though at the time there were awkward differences of opinion with a fellow actor. A good company man, Redgrave never hesitated to speak his mind. Meanwhile he gave an excellent performance as the schoolmaster in the film <span class="italic">The Browning Version</span> (1951).<br>
<br>During another Stratford year (1953) Redgrave had to perform the unnerving trinity of Shylock, Lear, and the Antony of <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>. As the triumvir at sunset he reached his Shakespearian height&#151;Peggy Ashcroft was Cleopatra&#151;and the play had a London season at the Princes. Films, such as <span class="italic">The Dam Busters</span> (1954), continued to occupy much of his time. He returned in 1958 to Stratford&#151;his last appearance there&#151;and again, at fifty, acted as Hamlet, a performance mature and deeply considered. Appointed CBE in 1952, he was knighted in 1959. His final major work in the theatre was at the Chichester festival of 1962 (as Uncle Vanya) and at the opening of the National Theatre in 1963, in the Old Vic, when he was an authoritative Claudius to the Hamlet of Peter O'Toole. The next year (1964) he was Solness in Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Master Builder</span>.<br>
<br>At the opening of the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, in May 1965, Redgrave returned to <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span>, which also had a West End showing. He had become a prodigiously popular film star in such productions as <span class="italic">Kipps</span> (1941) in which he played the title part, <span class="italic">The Way to the Stars</span> (1945), <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">The Quiet American</span> (1957); one of his last roles was General Wilson in <span class="italic">Oh! What a Lovely War</span> in 1969. Illness was developing: he had Parkinson's disease and he kept to readings, on various international tours, during the ebb of his career. His last appearance was in Simon Gray's <span class="italic">Close of Play</span> (National, 1979), a practically silent part during which he sat in a wheelchair for most of the play. Sir Michael Redgrave died on 21 March 1985 in a nursing home at Denham, Buckinghamshire. He was cremated at Mortlake crematorium, London, on 26 March, and a memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London (the actors' church) on 18 July.<br>
<br>Redgrave's publications include <span class="italic">The Actor's Ways and Means</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">Mask or Face</span> (1958), and a version of <span class="italic">The Aspern Papers</span> by Henry James, in which he acted, as &#145;H. J.&#146;, at the Queen's in 1959. He published in 1983 an autobiography, <span class="italic">In my Mind's Eye</span>.<br>
<br>Redgrave's wife, <a name="cosubject_89986"></a><span class="headword">Rachel Kempson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Rachel Redgrave, Lady Redgrave]</span>  (1910&#150;2003), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 28 May 1910 at 10 Mount Boone, Dartmouth, Devon, the daughter of Eric William Edward Kempson, headmaster of the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, and his wife, Beatrice Hamilton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashwell. She was educated at a private day school in Kew; St Agnes Convent in East Grinstead, Sussex; Colchester county high school, Essex; Oaklea, Buckhurst Hill, Essex; and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London (entering the same year as Joan Littlewood and Ida Lupino). Her first stage appearance was as Hero in <span class="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</span> at Stratford upon Avon in 1933. She made her first London appearance later the same year, as Bianca in <span class="italic">The Lady from Alfaqueque</span> at the Westminster Theatre. In 1936 she appeared with the Old Vic Company, and the following year joined John Gielgud's season at the Queen's Theatre. She acted little while her children were young, though she appeared with her husband in the Ealing film <span class="italic">The Captive Heart</span> (1946) and in the 1953 season at Stratford. In 1956 she was a founder member of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre under George Devine; she scored a notable success in the latter's production of Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Seagull</span> in 1964. She continued to appear regularly in the West End in the 1960s and 1970s, including in Alan Bennett's <span class="italic">The Old Country</span> at the Queen's Theatre in 1977, alongside Alec Guinness. She also appeared in films, including <span class="italic">Georgy Girl</span> (1966) and (with her daughter Vanessa and her son Corin) <span class="italic">The Charge of the Light Brigade</span> (1968). She continued to make occasional appearances in theatre, film, television, and radio roles in the 1980s and 1990s; her last film was <span class="italic">Deja Vu</span> (1998), in which she played the mother of Vanessa. She also performed a series of poetry readings with her son Corin. Her fierce loyalty to her husband (despite his homosexual affairs) extended to her children, and her acting colleagues. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">A Family and Its Fortunes</span>, was published in 1986. She died in Millbrook, New York, on 23 May 2003, while visiting her granddaughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102176/', "Natasha Richardson")</script>, and was survived by her three children.<br>
