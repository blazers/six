<span class="headword">Evans,  Frederick Henry</span>  (1853&#150;1943), <span class="occ">bookseller and photographer</span>, was born in Whitechapel, London, on 26 June 1853, the son of John Cleland Evans, a music teacher. He spent his early years as a clerk in the accounts department of a London business. After purchasing a Ross microscope, he bought a camera in 1883 for both photomicroscopic and landscape photography from George Smith, owner of the Sciopticon Company, which made lantern slides from Evans's negatives by the woodburytype process. In 1887 he received the Photographic Society of London's medal of honour for his photomicrographs. His insistence upon fine detail and tonal gradation in photography may have its origin with the lantern slide, a medium which he praised in his later writings. His lifelong engagement with the photography of cathedral architecture was begun on a visit to Salisbury Cathedral. Some of his first photographs of cathedrals were shown at the Photographic Society of London's annual exhibition of 1890, and in the following year he was elected a member of the London and Provincial Photographic Association.<br>
<br>Evans's love of literature and fine printing made him a constant visitor to a bookshop owned by Edward Jones in Queen Street, Cheapside, London; when he was offered a partnership in the business about 1890, he secured it with a loan from his father. When Jones died suddenly the bookshop was left with Evans. He became interested in portraiture about 1891, and he photographed George Bernard Shaw, Arthur Symons, and (most famously) Aubrey Beardsley, whom he captured in the pose of the Notre Dame gargoyle known as Le Stryge. In 1896 Evans made a series of photographs of Kelmscott Manor, the home of William Morris, for whose lectures on architecture he had provided lantern slides; he assembled a group of these photographs in a memorial portfolio after Morris's death. In 1908&#150;9 he produced a series of landscapes for a memorial edition of the poems of George Meredith.<br>
<br>Evans's first major exhibition, of 120 cathedral photographs, was held in March 1897 at the Architectural Club in Boston, Massachusetts. He retired from his bookshop in 1898, and on 26 November 1900 married Ada Emily Longhurst, daughter of James Longhurst, a builder; the couple had three children: Barbara, Evan, and Geoffrey. Evans now gave his full attention to the making of fine photographs and writing critical and technical articles on his chosen medium, the platinum print. In 1900 he was elected to the Linked Ring Brotherhood and a one-man show of his photographs was held at the Royal Photographic Society in April. In 1903 his work was featured in Alfred Stieglitz's magazine <span class="italic">Camera Work</span> with a portfolio of cathedral photographs. In his best-known photograph, <span class="italic">A Sea of Steps</span> (1903), of Wells Cathedral, he subjects the form of spiralling stairs to the flattening effect of the telephoto lens in order to express the difficulty of spiritual ascent.<br>
<br>In 1905 Evans collaborated with the writer Theodore Andrea Cook on a <span class="italic">Country Life</span> magazine commission to photograph the French ch&acirc;teaux for <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Great Houses of France</span> (1916). Evans's interest in the expression of symmetry in nature was reinforced by Cook's researches into the vitalism of the spiral form in mathematics, astronomy, botany, and the structure of the spiral staircase as illustrated by Evans in Cook's <span class="italic">The Curves of Life</span> (1914). About 1911 he compiled albums of his &#145;harmonograph&#146; drawings, spiral patterns made by the oscillations of a pair of pendulums set in harmonious ratios. His knowledge of the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg and Jakob Boehme underpinned his sense of physical and spiritual correspondences. In 1911 he produced a series of photographs of the interior of Westminster Abbey in London, many of which were published in <span class="italic">Country Life</span> (1911&#150;19).<br>
<br>In 1919 Evans sold 400 items from his large collection of rare and fine-printed books at Mitchell Kennerley's Anderson Galleries in New York. Between 1912 and 1925 he printed portfolios of platinum reproductions of wood-engravings by William Blake, Hans Holbein, and Edward Calvert, and ink drawings by Beardsley. He was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 1928. Frederick Henry Evans died on 24 June 1943 at his home at 32 Rosemont Road, Acton, Middlesex; he was survived by his wife.<br>
