<span class="headword">Overton,  William</span>  (1524/5?&#150;1609), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, is said by Wood to have been born in London and to have been elected a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1539, aged fifteen. He is reported elsewhere to have been first educated at Glastonbury Abbey. If the identification is correct Overton had migrated to Christ Church by 1547, when he graduated BA. He became a fellow of Magdalen in 1551, and proceeded MA on 8 July 1553, BTh on 16 February 1566, and DTh two days later. In 1552 he contributed verses to the volume commemorating the second and third dukes of Suffolk, both recently dead in their teens. There is no record of his ordination, but he was preferred in 1553 to the rectory of Balcombe, Sussex, and the vicarage of Eccleshall, Staffordshire, suggesting that he absented himself from Oxford at this time. In 1555 he was made rector of Swinnerton, Staffordshire. He does not appear to have gone into exile under Mary, though no doubt he kept a low profile, but following the accession of Elizabeth he acquired a number of prestigious livings. On 13 November 1559 he was presented by the crown to the canonry of the second prebend in Winchester Cathedral, and the rectories of Upham, Nursling, and Exton, all in Hampshire, and that of Cotton, Suffolk, soon followed. On 14 July 1561 he was collated to the prebend of Hova Villa in Chichester Cathedral.<br>
<br>The signs are that Overton was quick to cultivate the patronage of Lord Robert Dudley, from 1564 earl of Leicester. When Queen Elizabeth visited Oxford with Dudley in 1564 Overton took a large part in her reception, and participated in disputations held before her. On 22 May 1571 he declared to Leicester that he was his &#145;owne chapleyne, or at least wise the Queen's Majestie's chapleyn by your only meanes put and preferred unto her&#146;  (De Lisle and Dudley papers, Baskerville transcript, 1.237). Presumably Leicester's favour not only helped Overton to become treasurer of Chichester (6 May 1567) and prebendary of Yatesbury in Salisbury Cathedral (24 May 1570), but also enabled him to build upon his existing connections with the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, where he became rector of Stoke-on-Trent and of Hanbury.<br>
<br>Overton earned himself an unsavoury reputation in some quarters, partly thanks to his ambitions for himself and his family. He married twice, on both occasions forging alliances useful for an ecclesiastical career. His first wife, whom he married about 1566, was Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1601), daughter of William Barlow, bishop of Chichester, a connection which brought him increasing prominence in that diocese, both as treasurer and vicar-general. When Barlow died on 13 August 1568 Overton immediately wrote to Sir William Cecil recommending William Day, provost of Eton and another of the late bishop's sons-in-law, as Barlow's successor, as one &#145;noted among all for learning and piety&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 6346, fol. 45). Richard Curteys, however, was consecrated to the see on 21 May 1570. Overton then became the focus for an anti-Curteys faction within the cathedral chapter which threatened to wreck the new bishop's hopes of reform. Curteys sought to bypass Overton's opposition by packing the cathedral chapter, and a conflict developed which reached a crisis in July 1573 when the bishop's faction held an extraordinary chapter meeting and conducted business in the absence of a quorum. Overton's faction succeeded in forcing Curteys to promulgate new statutes preventing such abuses, but the victory was more apparent than real.<br>
<br>Overton was consecrated bishop of Coventry and Lichfield on 18 September 1580, presumably at the instigation of Leicester. He received a bad press from twentieth-century historians for grovelling to the queen, blaming the economic plight of the diocese on Thomas Bentham, his predecessor, and depleting the resources of an already impoverished see through an extravagant lifestyle. It is certainly true that he made several long leases to the crown and demised the manor of Lichfield to Elizabeth in perpetuity, while like many Elizabethan bishops he was said to have felled excessive amounts of timber on the episcopal estates. More damningly his letters suggest that he was prepared to do whatever his patron Leicester might require:<blockquote>I am your chapleyn of olde; I have been alwaies servisable at your commandment; I have been plyable to your letters and suytes; I have ben and am in case both able and ready to do you honor if you will use me. (De Lisle and Dudley papers, Baskerville transcript, 1.237)</blockquote>It may have been distaste for Overton's evident dependence on Leicester which led Cecil (now Baron Burghley) to denounce him in Elizabeth's presence for ordaining unworthy men to the priesthood for personal gain.<br>
<br>That charge remains unproven. It would have been impossible to staff the underfunded livings of Coventry and Lichfield without ordaining non-graduates, and there is no particular evidence to suggest that Overton was indiscriminate or irresponsible in this respect. He is, moreover, credited with being genial, hospitable (an element in the episcopal equation which weighed heavily with Elizabeth), and good to the poor. There is also evidence that he kept his episcopal residences in good repair. The jibes of Martin Marprelate that he was ignorant and unlearned are in direct contravention of the known facts of Overton's university career and his frequent appearances in the pulpit. They also fly in the face of his known preference for radical preachers of whom Marprelate must have approved. He granted preaching licences to Arthur Hildersham and William Bradshaw, lent his support to clerical exercises in Burton upon Trent and Southam, and allowed preachers like William Axton of Moreton Corbett to continue their activities despite their nonconformity.<br>
<br>Overton also appointed the reforming civil lawyer John Becon as chancellor of Lichfield and was prepared to defend his activities to Archbishop Whitgift and others who criticized them. Becon's &#145;Certain advertisements&#146; of 1584 would have associated the bishop, the chancellor, and certain selected preachers in examining ordinands and presentees to livings, and introduced an element of parish approval in the case of the latter, thus accommodating criticism of an authoritarian system in which the diocesan merely rubber-stamped presentations by ecclesiastical patrons. But Becon seems to have played little part in running the diocese and quarrelled with Overton at an early stage. By October 1583 the bishop had appointed Zachary Babington to be Becon's coadjutor as chancellor, so initiating a running battle between the two men which ended before Star Chamber, the privy council, and the archbishop of Canterbury. Matters were resolved only by Becon's death in 1587.<br>
<br>The fact nevertheless remains that with regard to the revenues of his see Overton appears to have been quarrelsome, aggressive, litigious, and possibly downright dishonest. He failed in his attempts to resume rights to property by legal process against Lord Paget and the city of Lichfield, among others. If that strategy had long-term beneficial consequences for the see it had immediate consequences for himself. He estimated that in the first year of his episcopate litigation had cost him &pound;740 and appearances before most of the major courts of the land. Perhaps more significantly it has been suggested that his tactics alienated his principal patron, Leicester, prevented his further promotion, and led to his humiliation in his own diocese. His dealings with the exchequer over his first fruits for the bishopric and annual taxes thereafter are complex to the point of incomprehensibility.<br>
<br>Little else can be said of Overton's twenty-nine years as bishop except that in 1600 he made a personal visitation of his diocese. If in the last analysis contemporary accounts of his corruption, venality, and nepotism seem well founded&#151;some of his grants to his son Plasted were rejected by the Lichfield chapter&#151;he might nevertheless also be seen as a forward-looking entrepreneur who seized opportunities to supplement the revenues of his diocese. He was responsible for bringing glass-making to Staffordshire, having as a canon of Chichester become acquainted with several leading Huguenot glass-making families. They apparently followed him to Buckholt, near Salisbury, when he became a canon there in 1570, and then to Eccleshall, after his appointment to Coventry and Lichfield. He fuelled their furnaces with timber from his own estates and the industry proved highly profitable locally.<br>
<br>Margaret Overton died in 1601 and (although by then seventy-six) the bishop soon remarried. His second wife was Mary, daughter of Edmund and Elizabeth Bradocke of Adbaston Hall, a few miles west of Eccleshall. Mary was related to the earls of Shrewsbury through her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Talbot, and Overton was not slow to make use of the connection. He designed an elaborate, highly coloured tomb for himself in Holy Trinity Church, Eccleshall, near his country palace, bearing his effigy and with a Latin epitaph stating that he had erected it for himself in 1603 &#145;in the hope of resurrection&#146;  (monument). Overton died on 9 April 1609 and was duly buried at Eccleshall. Nothing is known of the life of his widow or of any surviving children.<br>
