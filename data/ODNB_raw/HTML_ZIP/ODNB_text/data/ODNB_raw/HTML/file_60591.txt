<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Junge,  Alfred August</span>  (1886&#150;1964), <span class="occ">film production designer</span>, was born on 29 January 1886, in G&ouml;rlitz, Silesia, the only child of August Junge (<i>d</i>. 1897), a house painter, and his wife, Emma Hulda (1858&#150;1943), a seamstress. When he was eleven his father died, and at fourteen he left school to be apprenticed to a local house painter. While attending evening classes he found he had a talent for design and two years later he joined an art club, where he studied life drawing. Stagestruck, at the age of eighteen he started working at the local G&ouml;rlitz Stadttheater, trying his hand at everything from acting to special lighting effects. After further art studies in Germany and Italy he began to work as a scenic artist and designer at various provincial theatres in Germany and Switzerland, finally ending up with the Berlin Staatsoper and the Berlin Staatstheater, until the First World War intervened. Junge served in the German army until he was invalided out in 1917. On 13 November 1918 he married Elsbeth (Else) Gebhardt (1886&#150;1964), the daughter of a cabinet-maker from Frankfurt an der Oder, whom he had met when she was a flower girl in Berlin in 1912. The couple settled in an apartment on Bismarckstrasse in Berlin-Hermsdorf, their home until 1932. By 1922 they had two sons, Helmut (1921&#150;1989), who became an architect in America, and Ewald (1922&#150;2000), who had a varied career, encompassing arts journalism (including work in the 1950s for the BBC German Service and as an arts correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span>), classical music recording, and numismatics.<br>
<br>About 1920 Junge entered the film industry, working as an art director at the famous Universum Film studios in Berlin alongside some of the leading creative talents of the era, notably director E. A. Dupont. After the great success of <span class="italic">Vari&eacute;t&eacute;</span> in 1926, Dupont was courted by British International Pictures (BIP), and in 1928 Junge accompanied him to Elstree, where he designed two elaborate Dupont productions, <span class="italic">Moulin Rouge</span> and <span class="italic">Piccadilly</span>. The team remained at BIP until 1930. Junge then returned briefly to Germany, with a stopover in France to work on Alexander Korda's <span class="italic">Marius</span> (1931), the first film of the classic Marcel Pagnol trilogy. But it was England that was to be Junge's home base for the rest of his career. In 1932, on the strength of his experience at Universum Film and his much-admired work at BIP, he was brought to England once again, by producer Michael Balcon, on a five-year contract to head the new Gaumont-British art department at the Lime Grove studio in Shepherd's Bush in west London, where he was immediately put in charge of designing an ambitious Hollywood-style production programme. At Gaumont-British, Junge really came into his own with his invaluable organizational skills, Prussian sense of discipline and efficiency, and technical expertise, overseeing an extensive production schedule and deploying a whole army of draughtsmen and technicians. Junge was almost single-handedly responsible for bringing professional management and modern organization to British cinema design and he also supervised the studio's pioneering design apprenticeship programme, training and influencing many of Britain's future top film designers, including Michael Relph, Peter Proud, and Elliot Scott.<br>
<br>As Britain's first real supervising art director or &#145;production designer&#146;, as the role came to be described, Junge worked on an amazing range and number of films during his six years at Shepherd's Bush: Jessie Matthews musicals such as <span class="italic">Evergreen</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">It's Love Again</span> (1936), George Arliss character vehicles such as <span class="italic">The Iron Duke</span> (1935), Aldwych farces, Jack Hulbert comedies, and classic Hitchcock thrillers such as <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">Young and Innocent</span> (1937). After his stint at Gaumont-British, Junge was summoned to be supervising art director for MGM's new British operations at Denham, where he created the quaint English public school atmosphere of the nostalgic <span class="italic">Goodbye, Mr Chips</span> (1939).<br>
<br>During the 1940 invasion scare Junge was sent as an enemy alien to Huyton near Liverpool, where he was interned from May to July 1940. (Junge had applied for British citizenship in 1938, but had to wait to become a British citizen until just after the end of the Second World War.) He was soon released and back at work, this time with visionary director Michael Powell, who naturally turned to Junge to head the art department for the new production unit, the Archers, that he was assembling with Emeric Pressburger at Denham. Junge rose magnificently to the challenge of their first Technicolor production, the beautifully crafted <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</span> (1943). The Powell&#150;Pressburger films, among the most memorable of the 1940s, marked an outpouring of Junge's creative spirit. The poetic and quirky <span class="italic">A Canterbury Tale</span> (1944) was followed by the Scottish romance <span class="italic">I Know Where I'm Going!</span> (1945; Junge's own personal favourite, shot partly on the Isle of Mull), and the striking fantasy, set during the war, <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1946), with its monumental &#145;stairway to heaven&#146; and its inspired artistic conceit of a black and white heaven contrasting with the earthly pleasures of Technicolor. Junge's rich use of colour reached its height in the extravagant exoticism of <span class="italic">Black Narcissus</span> (1947), which won him an Academy award for design and the personal accolade of an autographed photo from its star, Deborah Kerr, inscribed &#145;To Alfred Junge, of all art directors the most brilliant&#146;.<br>
<br>Junge was in great demand after his Oscar, and MGM, which was resuming its British operations at Borehamwood, Elstree, made him the enticing offer of a lucrative seven-year contract as supervising art director. He accepted, heading the MGM British art department from 1947 to 1955, realizing a series of historical spectacles (<span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>, 1952; <span class="italic">Knights of the Round Table</span>, 1953) in the colour and widescreen processes of the 1950s, as well as working with a variety of Hollywood stalwarts such as John Ford (<span class="italic">Mogambo</span>, 1953) and George Cukor (<span class="italic">Edward, my Son</span>, 1949). By now himself a legend in the British film industry, Junge belonged to several professional organizations, notably the Society of British Film Art Directors and Designers (of which he was a founder member), the British Film Academy, and the British Kinematograph Society, and he published articles about film design in the British journals <span class="italic">The Artist</span>, <span class="italic">Film &amp; TV Technician</span>, and <span class="italic">British Kinematography</span>. After his MGM contract expired Junge went freelance. His last film work was helping to select Italian locations for David O. Selznick's <span class="italic">A Farewell to Arms</span>; he left early into this fraught production, exasperated by Selznick's incessant memo-writing.<br>
<br>Junge retired in 1957, at the age of seventy-one. Very much a family man, he spent his final years pursuing his main hobbies, photography and gardening. In 1948, with the money from his MGM contract, he had bought a magnificent rambling house designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, Greystanes, on a hilltop in Hendon, in north London. After his retirement Junge built a smaller house, Sunset Lodge, on a small parcel of his former domain, where he tended a lovely rose garden. But the golden years at Sunset Lodge proved to be short. A longtime sufferer from diabetes, the portly Junge also began to have heart problems. A first stroke in 1962 was followed by another in early 1964, and Junge went to a clinic at Bad Kissingen, West Germany, to recover. He died there suddenly of a stroke on 16 July 1964, less than six weeks after the death of his beloved wife, Else, in Hendon; both were cremated and were buried at Paddington new cemetery, Mill Hill, Middlesex. At his death Junge left more than 1000 set designs, mainly from his British period. These form the basis of four major Junge collections now in public archives at the British Film Institute, London; the Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que Fran&ccedil;aise, Paris; the Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek, Berlin; and the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, at the University of Texas at Austin, USA.<br>
