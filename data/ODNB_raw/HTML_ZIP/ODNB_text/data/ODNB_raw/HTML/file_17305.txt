</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lyttelton,  Charles</span>  (1714&#150;1768), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle and antiquary</span>, was born in Hagley, Worcestershire, the third son of the twelve children of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, fourth baronet (1685&#150;1751), MP, and Christian Temple (1688&#150;1759), daughter of Sir Richard Temple of Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and maid of honour to Queen Anne. At least between 1725 and 1728 he was educated at Eton College, where he was a member of Horace Walpole's &#145;triumvirate&#146; with George Montagu. He was admitted a student at the Middle Temple in 1731, but the following year matriculated from University College, Oxford. However, he returned to the law without taking his degree; he resided in lodgings at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 26 January 1739. He suffered from a severe respiratory illness at this time, taking the waters at Bath in 1739 after four months' poor health, and complained frequently afterwards of a constant cough and winter catarrh. He took annual summer tours on horseback of parts of Great Britain for the sake of his health as well as for interest.<br>
<br>In 1740 Lyttelton gave up the law for the less strenuous demands of the church, continuing his studies at University College and graduating DCL in 1745. In 1742 he was ordained by the elderly John Hough, bishop of Worcester, and the same year was instituted to the rectory of Alvechurch, Worcestershire. He was ambitious for preferment in the Church of England and had strong family connections with those in government, especially through his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17306/', "George Lyttelton, Lord Lyttelton")</script>, and his cousin George Grenville. Influence brought him appointment as chaplain-in-ordinary to George II in 1747, with the duty of waiting at court each December, and as dean of Exeter Cathedral in 1748, a position which was worth &pound;500 a year. He was disappointed of a bishopric when vacancies arose in 1756 and 1758, but Grenville helped him secure the bishopric of Carlisle in 1762, worth &pound;1300 a year, and he vacated Alvechurch and Exeter. His means were further increased by a bequest of over 2000 guineas from Lord Angelsea in 1761. Lyttelton had found Exeter remote from London, but in the few months of each year that he was there he began a scheme of restoration and refurbishment in the cathedral, starting in 1751 with reglazing the great east window. He was the first person to recognize the significance of the cathedral muniments and to try to arrange them. He found Carlisle even more remote, the weather disagreeable, the cathedral poorly furnished, and his residence at Rose Castle neglected and stripped by his predecessor. His restoration of the interior of the choir, carried out in collaboration with his amateur architect nephew, Thomas Pitt, Lord Camelford, was probably essential but was condemned as &#145;barbarous&#146; by R. W. Billings and the new woodwork was removed in 1853&#150;6. His substantial repairs to the Strickland Tower at Rose Castle have also not survived. A sermon on libel preached before the House of Lords in 1765 was his only published religious work; his chief interest in church matters was historical and particularly focused on medieval ecclesiastical architecture.<br>
<br>Lyttelton's earliest research, from at least 1731, was into Worcestershire history, and in 1738 he purchased the Revd William Thomas's important collection of the papers of Thomas Habington, the seventeenth-century county historian. Lyttelton added further notes on parishes with family connections, and wrote unpublished histories of Alvechurch, Hagley, and Frankley. His collections were used extensively by Dr Treadway Nash for his <span class="italic">History of Worcestershire</span> and his account of the fabric of Worcester Cathedral is inserted into Valentine Green's <span class="italic">History of &hellip; Worcester</span> (1796). He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1740, and his interests developed with a pioneering study of English Romanesque architecture, which was then called Saxon. He attempted to define its distinctive features by an analysis of detail, discussing his findings with other antiquaries from about 1742. With his friend Smart Lethieullier, he collected drawings of Saxon churches, and exhibited them at meetings of the Society of Antiquaries; A. C. Ducarel dedicated his <span class="italic">Anglo-Norman Antiquities</span> (1767) to Lyttelton for first interesting him in the subject. Lyttelton's essay, &#145;Some account of the cathedral church of Exeter&#146;, written in 1754 but not published until 1797 by the society, was the first history of the building. The society had no journal for publishing articles until <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> started in 1770, after his death. However, several of Lyttelton's papers were printed in the first three volumes, and demonstrated the breadth of his antiquarian interests, notably &#145;A dissertation on the antiquity of brick building in England&#146; and a perceptive paper recognizing that stone axes were made before the use of metal. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1743, but his scientific concerns were limited to the study of fossils, on which he wrote two short papers published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1748 and 1750. While publishing very little himself, Lyttelton used his knowledge and influence to assist other scholars. The Cornish historian William Borlase in particular acknowledged his help and wrote <span class="italic">Observations on &hellip; Scilly</span> in the form of a letter to Lyttelton.<br>
<br>Lyttelton had assisted the Society of Antiquaries in obtaining its royal charter in 1751, and served as president from 1765 until his death. He was a painstaking and methodical researcher, and his successor as president, Dean Milles, paid tribute to his knowledge of English history, retentive memory, affable temper, and willingness to receive and communicate information on points of antiquity. He was a prolific and informative letter writer, and before his death seems to have intended publishing accounts of his annual tours sent to friends, especially Sanderson Miller. He died, unmarried, at his house in Clifford Street, Westminster, on 22 December 1768, and was buried in the family vault in Hagley church. His estate amounted to &pound;6715 and he bequeathed many of his books and manuscripts, including the thirteenth-century Lindsey psalter, to the Society of Antiquaries. The rest of his letters were subsequently dispersed with other Lyttelton papers by Sothebys at a sale on 12 December 1978, and his accounts at a sale on 20 July 1989.<br>
