<span class="headword">Roberts, Sir  Gilbert</span>  (1899&#150;1978), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in Hampstead on 18 February 1899, the son of Henry William Roberts, pharmaceutical chemist, who died when Gilbert was a child, and his wife, Lily Hodgson, who later remarried. He had an elder sister and a half-brother. He was a bright boy with a gift for mathematics and was sent to Gresham College to study engineering, but soon after the outbreak of war in 1914 joined the Royal Flying Corps and served as a flight lieutenant in 73 squadron in France. In 1918 he was shot in the knee while on a bombing raid and spent some time in hospital before being awarded an army scholarship, which enabled him to complete his studies at the City and Guilds College, London. He graduated BSc with first-class honours in 1922.<br>
<br>Roberts started work as an assistant to Ralph Freeman of Sir Douglas Fox &amp; Partners on the design of the Sydney harbour bridge for Dorman Long &amp; Co., and when they were awarded the contract in 1924 he was transferred with the rest of the design team to their office in London. He worked with them for ten years, initially on the Sydney harbour and Newcastle upon Tyne bridges, and then from 1931 on the design and construction of welded steel bridges, of which his Billingham Bridge was the first all-welded bridge in Britain. In 1925 he married Elizabeth Nada, daughter of Frederick Rudolph Hora, schoolmaster. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1936 to 1945 Roberts was in charge of construction and development for Sir William Arrol in Glasgow, where he took the initiative in substituting welding for the traditional riveting of joints in steel structures. He stayed with Arrol for a further four years as director and chief engineer before joining, in 1949, Freeman, Fox &amp; Partners, with whom he remained until his retirement in 1969. He was jointly responsible for the original design work on the great suspension bridges across the estuaries of the Severn, Forth, and Humber, and later developed and patented the revolutionary aerofoil-shaped box-girder deck of the final Severn Bridge design. He was knighted in 1965 for his work on the Forth road bridge, which had been opened the previous year.<br>
<br>Among Roberts's many other notable designs were the Dome of Discovery at the Festival of Britain (1951); Auckland harbour bridge, the Wye Bridge on the Welsh side of the Severn crossing, the Volta River bridge (later known as Adomi bridge) in Ghana, and the new Maidenhead Bridge; radio telescopes in Australia and Canada; and two Goliath cranes of 400 tons capacity for use in the construction of nuclear power stations. He was also involved in the design of two bridges, at Milford Haven in Wales and the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne, Australia, both of which collapsed during construction in 1970, with the loss of four and thirty-five lives respectively. In the first accident the design was certainly not at fault, but the underlying cause and the ultimate responsibility for the West Gate tragedy were never clearly established, in spite of the most searching questioning of Roberts and other witnesses by the Australian royal commission investigating the accident. A few weeks later he suffered a heart attack, and on recovery was ordered complete rest.<br>
<br>Roberts's writings included numerous papers and articles on the design and construction of his bridges and other structures. He was a fellow of the Royal Society (1965), the institutions of Civil and Structural Engineers, the Institute of Welding, the American Society of Civil Engineers, Imperial College, London, and the City and Guilds of London Institute. He was awarded the Telford gold medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1967), the royal medal of the Royal Society (1968), the James Watt medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1969), and the Churchill gold medal of the Society of Engineers (1970). Awards received by Freeman, Fox &amp; Partners, to which his outstanding designs contributed in no small way, included the Queen's award to industry in 1967, and, jointly with Rolls-Royce, the first MacRobert award in 1969. Roberts died of heart failure on 1 January 1978 at St Stephen's Hospital, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
