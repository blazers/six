<span class="headword">Orford,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1310), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, presumably originated from Orford, Suffolk. Ely Cathedral priory had lands there, and Orford became a monk, and eventually prior, of that house. Following the death of Ralph Walpole on 20 March 1302, Orford was elected bishop by the convent by the way of compromise on 14 April, and gained royal assent on 6 May, but the election was quashed on 16 July by Archbishop Robert Winchelsey, on the grounds of the elect's inadequate learning. Orford immediately appealed to Rome, pleading his own case before Pope Boniface VIII. He displayed skill and learning in expounding the hostile hearing he had been given by Winchelsey, and caused pope and cardinals to burst into laughter by describing how, having countered the first two of the archbishop's arguments, he had dealt with the difficult third by answering not theologically but logically, so as to avoid a conclusion. Boniface, deciding that Orford was not, as Winchelsey had described him, an empty vessel, confirmed the election on 22 October, and ordered Orford's consecration, which took place in Rome on the 28th. The temporalities were restored on 4 February 1303, and the new bishop then rebutted Winchelsey's claim to the right to enthrone him, on the grounds that the throne had already been granted by apostolic authority.<br>
<br>As bishop, Orford succeeded in completing the gift made to the priory by his predecessor John Kirkby (<i>d</i>. 1290) of property in Holborn, Middlesex, and Hadham, Hertfordshire, and negotiated with the crown a confirmation of the priory's liberties. He subsequently made gifts to the convent of fine vestments, and also of a precious breviary which was assigned to the priory chapel (Prior Crauden's chapel, in the cathedral precinct). The monastery was in some financial trouble, and Orford, by his injunctions of 1307, made some effort to remedy this: thus the prior was instructed to make customary payments due to the obedientiaries, who in turn were to pay off their predecessors' debts as soon as possible; the accounts of the obedientaries were to be audited; and restrictions were placed on the prior's giving of hospitality. Orford himself, by his journey to Rome, was said to have incurred a debt of &pound;15,000. Despite these difficulties, the building work that beautified the cathedral in the first thirty years of the fourteenth century has led to Orford's episcopate being described as part of &#145;the flowering time of genius&#146; at Ely  (Evans, ix). Orford died at Little Downham, Cambridgeshire, on 21 January 1310 and was buried in Ely Cathedral before the high altar, next to Ralph Walpole.<br>
