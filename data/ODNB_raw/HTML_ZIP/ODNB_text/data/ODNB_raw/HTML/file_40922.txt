<span class="headword">Delysia,  Alice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Alice Henriette Lapize]</span>  (1889&#150;1979), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 3 March 1889 in Paris, the daughter of Henri Lapize, sculptor. She made her first appearance as a chorus girl at the age of fourteen in <span class="italic">The Belle of New York</span> by Hugh Morton at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Moulin Rouge in Paris in 1903, and in 1905 went to New York as one of the chorus of French &#145;Gibson girls&#146; in the Broadway production of <span class="italic">The Catch of the Season</span> by Seymour Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton. In 1909, after working for several years in London, she left the stage. She was at that time living with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94148/', "Harry Fragson")</script> (born L&eacute;on Philippe Pot), singer and composer of the famous song &#145;Hello! Hello! Who's your lady friend?&#146; Although there is no evidence that they were married, she worked under the name of Mme Harry Fragson. The couple parted&#151;a year before Fragson was murdered by his father following a quarrel over his mistress&#151;and Alice returned to the Paris theatre in 1912.<br>
<br>Alice Delysia was discovered by C. B. Cochran at the Olympia variety theatre in Paris in 1913 when he was looking for talent for a revue he wanted to stage on the lines of those he had seen in the small variety theatres in Paris. Cochran took her to London in 1914 to star in his first revue, <span class="italic">Odds and Ends</span> by Harry Grattan at the Ambassadors Theatre. Her rendition of the recruiting song &#145;We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go&#146; was a triumph, and only after more than 500 performances was <span class="italic">Odds and Ends</span> replaced by a new revue, <span class="italic">More</span>, also by Grattan, another great success, starring Delysia and the French actor L&eacute;on Morton. After the success of <span class="italic">Pell Mell</span> by Fred Thompson and Morris Harvey in 1916, again starring Delysia and Morton, Cochran left the Ambassadors for a larger theatre and in 1917 put on the operetta <span class="italic">Carminetta</span>, with music by Emile Lassailly, at the Prince of Wales Theatre with Delysia, despite her lack of training as a singer. Her warm and effervescent personality contributed to her popularity in London, and she sang in many charity performances during the First World War. She entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1918 she returned to revue in <span class="italic">As you were</span> by Arthur Wimperis (from the French) at the London Pavilion, which Cochran had refurbished and reopened: in this she played Helen of Troy, Queen Elizabeth, and Cleopatra, and the skin-tight black costume in which she appeared as Lucifer had to be modified after attracting the attention of the lord chamberlain.<br>
<br>After the war Delysia remained in London to play in <span class="italic">Afgar</span> by Fred Thompson and Worton David, a musical comedy set in a Moorish harem, staged by Cochran at the London Pavilion in 1919; this ran for 300 performances and she went to New York at the end of 1920 for the Broadway production. She returned to the London stage in 1922 in Cochran's <span class="italic">Mayfair and Montmartre</span>, which flopped after Delysia had to withdraw with a throat infection. She continued to delight London audiences throughout the 1920s, mainly in revues and musicals staged by Cochran, including Noel Coward's <span class="italic">On with the Dance</span> in 1925 at the London Pavilion, in which she played a French lady's maid and with Hermione Baddeley sang the duet &#145;Poor little rich girl&#146;, Noel Coward's first song hit. She was in Jerome Kern's <span class="italic">The Cat and the Fiddle</span> in 1932 at the Palace Theatre, and her last big London success was at the Gaiety Theatre in 1933, in <span class="italic">Mother of Pearl</span>, adapted for the English stage with Delysia in mind by A. P. Herbert (1890&#150;1971) from Oscar Straus's <span class="italic">Eine Frau, die weiss was sie will</span>: she played an ageing actress whose lover is stolen by her daughter and her song &#145;Every woman thinks she wants to wander&#146; was a big hit. On 8 November 1928 she had married Georges Emile Denis, general manager of a newspaper, the son of Nicolas Denis, store superintendent; the marriage ended in divorce in 1938.<br>
<br>Believing that the only hope for France lay in Britain and General de Gaulle, Delysia joined the Entertainments National Service Association in May 1941, and served until the end of the war entertaining troops in north Africa, the Middle East, Normandy, Belgium, and the Netherlands: she was awarded the African Star of the Eighth Army. On 10 January 1944 she married Commander (Joseph Marie Antoine) Ren&eacute; Kolb-Bernard of the Free French navy, who had heard her sing after Dunkirk and had asked to her to adopt the crew of the French submarine he was commanding. After the war she retired from the stage. Kolb-Bernard was appointed French minister in Nicaragua, and went on to hold a number of diplomatic posts, including that of French consul in the Canary Islands, where Delysia spent much of her retirement. He predeceased her. Alice Delysia died from cancer on 10 February 1979 in the French Convalescent Home, De Courcel Road, Brighton.<br>
