<span class="headword">Williams,  Sarah</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Sadie]</span>  (1837/8&#150;1868), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was the only daughter of Louisa and Robert Williams (<i>d</i>. 1868), a successful Welsh businessman living in Kentish Town. She was to attribute her poetic talent to Welsh ancestry. Her cosseted upbringing in a quietly pious, apolitical dissenting family included early schooling from a governess. Family holidays were spent in Wales and on the south coast of England, and included a trip to Paris. Her childhood self-appellation, Sadie, became her literary pseudonym.<br>
<br>In the early 1850s Sarah Williams attended Queen's College, Harley Street, London, where her literary talent was recognized and fostered by the subsequent principal, Edward Hayes Plumptre (1821&#150;1891), a man renowned for his encouragement of women's education. Illness curtailed this phase of her education. An introduction to Alexander Strahan (1833&#150;1918), the evangelical publisher, obtained for her the entr&eacute;e to <span class="italic">Good Words</span>, the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">The Argosy</span>, to which she contributed a series of humorous sketches, &#145;The Foozy Papers&#146;, and poems. A posthumously published collection of poetry, <span class="italic">Twilight Hours</span> (1868), is remarkable for the wide scope of lyric forms and genres, ranging from children's verse, religious, and pastoral to a lovers' correspondence in verse, &#145;Sospiri volate&#146;. Her interest in the speaking voice is reminiscent of the Brownings, and the timbre sometimes more akin to Christina Rossetti's, but a distinctive voice emerges. An attentive ear for dialogue is also the distinguishing feature of her prose. Her only complete novel, <span class="italic">The Prima Donna</span>, the Gothic plot of which she had first used for a narrative poem, was posthumously published in 1884. Half of all her earnings were devoted to charities for the sick and the poor.<br>
<br>The pain of Sarah Williams's incurable cancer may have explained the abstracted air upon which observers frequently remarked. She was reputed to have &#145;a face, which without beauty, attracted and arrested one&#146;  (Mayo, 205). After her adored father's unexpected death in January 1868 she decided to risk an operation in the hope of prolonging her life and moving with her mother to Wales. To her great friend, Bessie Palmer, she expressed her dilemma thus: &#145;Bangor, or heaven, Bessie,&#151;Bangor or Heaven&#146;  (ibid., 207). The operation was unsuccessful and she died at her home, 95 Queen's Crescent, Kentish Town, on 25 April 1868.<br>
