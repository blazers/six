<span class="headword">Purves,  James</span>  (1734&#150;1795), <span class="occ">Universalist preacher</span>, was born on 23 September 1734 at Blackadder, Identown (Edington), Berwickshire, the son of a shepherd who died in 1754. After only a quarter of a year at school he was taught writing and arithmetic by his parents. In 1756 he apprenticed himself to his uncle, a wheelwright at Duns. According to his own, now lost, account he was raised in the Church of Scotland. Then from reading the books of seceders he &#145;discovered that the revolution settlement was erroneous in doctrine and government&#146;. In 1755 he joined a covenanting society at Chirnside connected with the minority Reformed Presbytery. The minority in 1753 had sided with the theory of universal atonement in James Fraser Brea's <span class="italic">Treatise on Justifying Faith</span> (1749) and split off when the majority condemned it. In 1755 the minority presbytery itself divided when some members relaxed their loyalty to the Scottish covenants. The Chirnside society remained loyal. In spring 1756, after reading Isaac Watt's <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Logos</span> (1726), Purves adopted an Arian position that Christ, with a pre-existent human soul, was first born of all creation. By 1763 he had achieved sufficient prominence for the society to send him to Coleraine, Ireland, to consult with Irish dissenters of similar doctrine. Then, six years later, on 27 July 1769, the society chose him by lot to become a preacher among them. The society sent him to Glasgow to gain competence in the biblical languages but he proved unable to disengage himself from secular affairs because of &#145;an increase in disastrous occurrences&#146;. Purves later interpreted these disastrous occurrences as the start of the final half day of the apocalyptic three and one half days  (<span class="roman">Revelation</span>, 11: 11) which ended when the American War of Independence began.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1771 the Universalist societies published an account of their faith. No copy survives, but it was denounced by other members of the minority Reformed Presbytery for following the Socinian doctrine of John Taylor of Norwich. The denunciation occasioned some correspondence between Purves and Alexander Fortune, and members of the Reformed Presbytery, and in 1778 Purves published the Arian side of the correspondence in his <span class="italic">Observations on the Conduct of &hellip; the Reformed Presbytery</span>.<br>
<br>In 1776 some members moved from the Merse to Edinburgh and, according to their minute book, &#145;formed a new society, with a member who was there before&#146;. Having consulted with their friends in the Merse, they asked James Purves to join them, and on 15 November of that year invited him to take pastoral charge. He had special responsibility for administering the sacraments, but leading worship was shared with others who were inclined to do so, and who were encouraged to pray and give exhortation in public meetings. The society may have strayed from Westminster orthodoxy, but these Universalist Arian dissenters remained faithful to the covenanting tradition of the Reformed Presbytery for their original minute begins: &#145;The successors of the Remnant who testified against the corruption of the Revolution Constitution of the Church of Scotland as settled about the year 1689&#146;  (NA Scot., CH 15/1/1).<br>
<br>The society consisted of eight or nine families, mainly tradesmen and craftsmen, who met in the Broughton area of the city. Purves had correspondence addressed to him in Broughton Loan and was described as a teacher. From 1777 he was living at Wright's Houses, Bruntsfield, Edinburgh. Between 1785 and 1787 he exchanged letters and books with the Unitarian Thomas Fyshe Palmer, who hoped to move Purves on from a pre-existent Arian christology to a fully humanitarian Unitarian (Socinian) one by lending him books by Nathaniel Lardner, Joseph Priestley, and Theophilus Lindsey. But neither Palmer nor Purves would move from their respective positions. Purves set out his views in <span class="italic">Some Observations on Socinian Arguments</span> (1790), which on its title page bears the text from <span class="roman">Colossians</span> 1: 17 &#145;he is before all things, and by him all things consist&#146;.<br>
<br>On 21 June 1792, after the society had moved into the Barber's Hall, Todrig's Wynd, High Street, Edinburgh, they resolved to publish a <span class="italic">Declaration of Religious Opinions of the Universalist Dissenters</span>, written by Purves, in which they adopted the name Universalist dissenters. The <span class="italic">Declaration</span>'s christology accords with Purves's high Arianism. Christ the first created of God was born of a virgin, died on the cross for the sins of humankind, rose on the third day and is seated on the right hand of the Father, &#145;angels authority and powers, being made subject to him&#146;  (Purves, section 2.4). Humankind is in a state of rebellion but God's kingdom is universal and &#145;all things shall be finally reconciled and gathered together&#146;  (Purves, section 4.4). Copies were sent to friends in Dalkeith, Dunbar, Chirnside, and Dundee.<br>
<br>Purves, according to a descendant who possessed copies of his works, was a prolific writer of some twenty titles, many of which he typeset himself and sold at his bookshop in St Patrick's Square on Edinburgh's south side. Several of these titles can no longer be traced. Among the lost works were two treatises on civil government, a Hebrew grammar, and <span class="italic">Observations on the Visions of the Apostle John</span> (1789), where Purves predicted that Christ would manifest his priestly and kingly power about 1811. Among works which have survived is <span class="italic">An humble attempt to investigate the scripture doctrine concerning the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit</span> (1784) which was reprinted by American Universalists in 1819. This upholds the doctrine of universal restoration and defends the Arian remodelling of the Trinity against Socinian Unitarianism.<br>
<br>Purves was married three times: first to Isabel Blair about 1765, second, on her death, to Sarah Brown, about whom no details are known, and finally to Lilias Scott. For many years Purves suffered from asthma. He became seriously ill in the autumn of 1794 and died on 1 February 1795. He was buried in the old Calton cemetery, his remains being removed to its new site when Regent Road was built. His widow continued his book-selling business before emigrating to America. His daughter Elizabeth (1766&#150;1839), by his first marriage, married Hamilton Dunn and this family remained associated with the Universalist society which in 1813 changed its name to Unitarian. In 1835 Purves's society became St Mark's Unitarian Church, Castle Terrace, Edinburgh.<br>
