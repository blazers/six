<span class="headword">Bacon, Sir  Edmund Castell</span>, thirteenth baronet and fourteenth baronet  (1903&#150;1982), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 18 March 1903 at 18 Cadogan Square, London, the only son and fifth of six children of Sir Nicholas Henry Bacon, twelfth and thirteenth baronet (1857&#150;1947), of Raveningham Hall, Norfolk, and his wife, Constance Alice (<i>d</i>. 1962), younger daughter of Alexander Samuel Leslie-Melville, of Branston Hall, Lincolnshire. He was descended from Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper to Queen Elizabeth I. Educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, he subsequently studied farming and estate management. In 1936 he married Priscilla Dora, daughter of Colonel Charles Edward Ponsonby, later baronet and MP for Sevenoaks. They had one son and four daughters.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Bacon commanded the 55th (Suffolk yeomanry) anti-tank regiment of the Royal Artillery in Normandy and Belgium. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed OBE in 1945. In 1947 his father died leaving him 4000 acres in Norfolk and 10,000 acres in Lincolnshire, a unique collection of English watercolours, and the collection of John Staniforth Beckett with its Dutch landscapes. Bacon also succeeded to his father's titles, becoming thirteenth baronet, of Redgrave (created in 1611), and fourteenth baronet, of Mildenhall (created in 1627). The family had a long tradition of public service, and in 1949 Bacon was appointed lord lieutenant of Norfolk, a post he held until 1978. His period of office ended with the successful silver jubilee appeal in 1977. Norfolk was one of the few counties which exceeded its target.<br>
<br>In 1953 the eastern counties of Britain suffered from the severest of weather and tidal surges, and Norfolk took the fullest brunt of them. Bacon energetically organized relief forces and headed a county relief appeal fund. No other county raised such a large sum in proportion to its population, and nowhere else were the funds so promptly distributed to the sufferers. It was this practical administrative ability which later enabled Bacon to spearhead the campaign for the crucial refurbishment of Norwich Cathedral after 1956; he was high steward at the cathedral from 1956 until 1979. His religious beliefs were deeply held but they were more a positive moral conviction than an exact allegiance to one particular doctrine of Christianity. When he was made an honorary freeman of Norwich, he said that nothing had given him so much satisfaction as the part he played safeguarding the structure of the cathedral for the next generation.<br>
<br>Bacon's interests in agricultural concerns were put to the test in the management of his own substantial estates. These enterprises and a family property company in London allowed him to develop a shrewd business sense, and led to appointments at both local and national level. He was president of Eastern Counties Farmers, the country's second largest agricultural co-operative, until 1973. As chairman of the British Sugar Corporation during an eleven-year period of rationalization (1957&#150;68), he was able to introduce new company policy without causing the kind of conflicts within the labour force which became so prevalent in the next decade. His most demanding job was as chairman in 1966&#150;71 of the agricultural National Economic Development Committee (Neddy), whose purpose was to stabilize agricultural markets. Towards the end of his life he was awarded the Royal Agricultural Society's gold medal for distinguished services to agriculture.<br>
<br>A director of Lloyds Bank, and president of the Norfolk branch of the Magistrates' Association for twenty-nine years, Bacon also played an active part in the founding of the University of East Anglia, where he was pro-chancellor from 1964 to 1973. He was awarded an honorary DCL there in 1969. Bacon proved to be a skilful chairman during the period of student unrest and demonstrations in the late 1960s, when he presided over critical meetings calmly and steadfastly. In 1969, following the unilateral declaration of independence in Rhodesia, Bacon provided much behind-the-scenes support for his friend, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, the governor.<br>
<br>Although Bacon lived and looked like a country squire (he was happiest dressed in baggy, very old cavalry-twill trousers), he was a versatile man with wide interests. Hugely built, with hunched shoulders and sharp blue eyes, he endeared himself to people by his simple charm. In 1965 he was appointed KBE and in 1970 he was among four new knights of the Garter, the first baronet ever to be so honoured by the queen. He died on 30 September 1982 at the County Hospital, Lincoln. He left estate valued at &pound;855,542, and was succeeded in the baronetcies by his son, Nicholas Hickman Ponsonby Bacon (<i>b</i>. 1953).<br>
