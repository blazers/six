<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Charles Wye</span>  (1779/80&#150;1866), <span class="occ">developer of steam navigation</span>, was born in Dublin, the second of four sons of Thomas Williams, secretary to the Bank of Ireland, and his wife. Although trained in the law and called to the Irish bar in 1812, his lifelong passion was the new technology of steam machinery. In 1806&#150;7 he erected a large linen mill in northern Ireland, installed powerful machinery, and introduced cast-iron spur gearing, apparently not seen before in Ireland. While managing the mill, he became an avid student of chemical processes and their application first to linen, and later to fuel. His mentors were among the most eminent scientists of the day.<br>
<br>Williams's interest in steam shipping began when his friend John Oldham constructed a new revolving paddle wheel. Williams grasped its significance and paid for its patent in 1818. With modifications, this wheel (later known as the Morgan wheel) became the standard for steamships until displaced by the screw. At this time, seagoing shipping driven by steam became viable and Williams perceived that this technology could transform Ireland's economy.<br>
<br>Ireland had a maritime economy. Irish entrepreneurs grew rich by supplying naval stores for the wars fought in the Atlantic between <i>c</i>.1750 and 1815, but after the peace Atlantic trade diminished dramatically. England was the obvious haven for trade; Irish foodstuffs and labour were readily exchanged for manufactured goods. The abolition in 1825 of duties on both sides of the Irish Sea furthered the integration of Ireland's economy with Britain's; the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company formed by Williams in 1824 speeded up the process with cheap, regular, and frequent transport.<br>
<br>Irish merchants eagerly invested their idle capital in steam shipping and Williams's company expanded rapidly. Many shipowners followed in the wake of the Dublin company, but by 1830 Williams had effective control of all traffic plying between Britain and Ireland. Already the largest short-haul company in the United Kingdom, the Dublin company remained dominant until 1850. Long before that, the Irish Sea was the first seaway in the world to abandon sail for steam.<br>
<br>Always seeking innovations, Williams commissioned the first iron seagoing vessels (1833&#150;4) from John Laird, the Birkenhead shipbuilder. These were the first to be fitted with iron bulkheads for safety, also Williams's invention. After repairs and extensions while they were on inland waterways, Williams was able to carry cargo direct to Irish Sea ports in this fleet of canal and river steamboats, making the whole passage quicker, cheaper, and more convenient.<br>
<br>Williams, and shipowners who followed him, looked beyond Liverpool for markets. Finding that ships with bigger hulls and powerful engines could make longer voyages more economically, he inaugurated a regular summer line as far as Bordeaux in 1827. In the later 1830s, technological advances in marine navigation made long-distance voyages possible; the only obstacle, the heavy operating cost, was removed when the government offered subsidies by way of mail contracts on Britain's major trade routes. A front runner in the competition for the north Atlantic, he set up the Transatlantic Steam Company in 1838, in partnership with two of the Dublin company's directors&#151;Joseph Christopher Ewart, a Liverpool merchant, and Francis Carlton, another Irishman&#151;and acquired two very large ships. This contract, however, went to Samuel Cunard, the Canadian shipowner.<br>
<br>Williams was left with two expensive ships on his hands. Fortuitously, his friend Captain Richard Bourne RN, was badly in need of them. In 1837 Bourne, also an Irish shipowner, had been granted a mail contract for Iberian ports. He sold his Dublin and London Marine to Williams, who named it the British and Irish Steam Packet Company and worked it as a subsidiary to his Dublin company. For the service to Spain and Portugal, Bourne's new concern was called the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company. His ships made frequent calls at Gibraltar, the gateway to the Mediterranean, through which the anticipated route to India via Egypt would run. In 1839, the government unexpectedly decided to seek tenders for the mail contract for this new trade route before Bourne had time to build the necessary large steamers. He turned to Williams who agreed on a merger; the Transatlantic and Peninsular companies were subsumed in the new Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P. &amp; O.).<br>
<br>When P. &amp; O. was launched in 1840, Williams was the only director on its board with experience of an incorporated company. From its inception, his Dublin company had limited liability under the <span class="roman">Anonymous Persons Act</span> passed in 1783 by the Irish parliament. His own companies were so successful that his contemporaries recognized him as the first of a new breed of man in the shipping world: the professional manager. His guidance to the fledgeling P. &amp; O. was of inestimable value; so, of course, was his capital in ships. Indeed, no individual made so marked a contribution to the development of the business of steam shipping in its infancy during the years 1820 to 1850. He set the pace, laid down the ground rules, and created precedents for others to follow. His peers honoured his achievements by making him an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1835 and of the Institution of Naval Architects in 1862. He also received a gold medal from the Royal Society of Arts in 1856.<br>
<br>An Irish patriot, Williams did not believe that politics would solve Ireland's problems, and in 1830 he refused invitations from admirers in Dublin and Liverpool to stand for parliament. He was, however, willing to give evidence in innumerable parliamentary select committees, and he published several books and pamphlets on a variety of subjects connected with fuel and steam shipping, the last of them written in his eighty-first year. His skills, energy, and curiosity were prodigious: he could be engineer, naval architect, scientist, and businessman by turns. A thoroughly practical man, he was also an idealist. Having made steam transport on the Irish Sea available to all classes, he hoped that the reciprocal trade across the water would solve Irish problems, though in this he was mistaken.<br>
<br>Williams retired from P. &amp; O.'s board in 1854 and from that of his Dublin company in 1860. He was greatly admired, and had many warm personal friendships. He and his wife, Frances, whom he married on 16 December 1847, had one son who died young. Williams moved to Liverpool in the 1830s, and died there at his home, The Nook, St James's Mount, on 2 April 1866, survived by his wife.<br>
