<span class="headword">Collinson,  Peter</span>  (1694&#150;1768), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at the sign of the Red Lion, Gracechurch Street, London, on 28 January 1694, the son of Peter Collinson, cloth merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Hall. He was raised in a Quaker family of cloth merchants and became a partner in the family business, which had extensive trade with America. Through this connection he became acquainted with Benjamin Franklin, to whose experiments with electricity he contributed information about similar work in Germany. Franklin also informed him of the discovery of mastodon bones on the banks of the Ohio River in 1767, a subject on which Collinson gave two accounts to the Royal Society (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 57, 1767, 46&#150;7). He also supported the foundation of a subscription library in Philadelphia and encouraged the colonists to experiment with a wider range of crops.<br>
<br>As a small boy Collinson had lived with relatives in Peckham, then a separate hamlet south of London. From the garden there, which he later inherited, he acquired a love of plants which was to last for the rest of his life. Probably his greatest contribution to horticulture was through his friendship with John Bartram, the father of American botany. In the early 1730s, Bartram wrote to Collinson soliciting the post of king's botanist in North America, a position that Collinson was able to obtain for him only in 1765. In the meantime, however, Collinson established a scheme whereby Bartram supplied seeds and seedlings to British patrons in return for an annual subscription.<br>
<br>This scheme eventually attracted at least sixty subscribers, including such eminent landscape planters as the dukes of Argyll, Bedford, and Richmond. Collinson cultivated a similar passion for planting in the duke of Newcastle's heir, Henry Fiennes Clinton, earl of Lincoln. Largely through botany, Collinson, who was a lifelong whig, knew at least two prime ministers&#151;Lord Lincoln's uncle, Henry Pelham, and Lord Bute, the effective founder of the botanical garden at Kew. His greatest prot&eacute;g&eacute; and friend, however, was Lord Petre, who at his premature death in 1742 had planted 40,000 American trees on his estate at Thorndon in Essex.<br>
<br>Collinson was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Royal Society (elected 1728), to which he submitted reports on a wide variety of natural history topics. He was acquainted with a wide range of natural historians. Through his connection with the Royal Society, he became a close enough friend of Sir Hans Sloane to expect that he might have been made curator of Sloane's collection after his death, an expectation in which he was frustrated. He was also close to John Fothergill (who wrote his first biography), and numbered among his acquaintance such eminent botanists as John Ellis, Stephen Hales, and J. J. Dillenius. He also knew Linnaeus, having been introduced to him by Hermann Boerhaave in 1736. The connection later led Linnaeus both to encourage Collinson to catalogue his plants and to name horse balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>) after him.<br>
<br>Collinson was equally interested in more ordinary plantsmen. He lent Mark Catesby the money to publish his <span class="italic">Natural History of Carolina</span>, and he corresponded with the American botanists Alexander Garden and Cadwallader Colden. He also passed on many of his seeds to James Gordon, the nurseryman who had been gardener to Lord Petre. Collinson owned and heavily annotated several editions of the <span class="italic">Gardeners Dictionary</span> by Philip Miller, the gardener of the Chelsea Physic Garden, who was another friend. He was fearful that such men would be excluded from botany by Linnaeus's new system of nomenclature and wrote to him in 1754 to object that only &#145;real professors&#146; could now pretend to attain to the science.<br>
<br>Collinson's famous garden was at Mill Hill, an estate which he inherited (in 1749) through his marriage to Mary Russell in 1724. They had four children, of whom Michael (1727&#150;1795) was also a distinguished botanist. Among Collinson's garden's curiosities was a rare collection of magnolias, one of them (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>) introduced by him. One of his many contributions to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> is a paper in 1751 listing forty-three plants imported in that year. He was responsible for introducing into Britain the American alder, three species of azalea, black birch, hemlock, sugar maple, mountain laurel, and many medicinal herbs. In 1843 Lewis Dillwyn published <span class="italic">Hortus Collinsonianus</span>, a reconstructed list of all the plants in this garden. Collinson died at Mill Hill in August 1768, having been taken ill at Thorndon. He was buried at the Quaker burial-ground, Long Lane, Bermondsey.<br>
