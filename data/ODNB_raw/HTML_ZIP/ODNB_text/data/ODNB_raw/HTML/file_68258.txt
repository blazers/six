<span class="headword">Smith,  Thomas</span>  (1624&#150;1661), <span class="occ">scholar and theological controversialist</span>, was born in London, the son of Thomas Smith (mother's name unknown), and educated at St Paul's School. He was admitted as a sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1640, and took the degrees of BA in 1644, MA in 1647, and BD in 1654. He was ordained (presumably covertly) by Bishop Joseph Hall, and instituted as vicar of Caldecote, Cambridgeshire, in 1650. He held the post of praelector in rhetoric at Christ's, and was university librarian from 1659 to his death in 1661.<br>
<br>Smith's particular scholarly interest was in Arabic: he was press corrector for Brian Walton's polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>, for which he obtained manuscripts from Cambridge. But his principal distinction is as a champion of the Church of England during the interregnum, continuing the work of the Tew circle. Introducing a translation of Jean Daill&eacute;'s work, entitled <span class="italic">Treatise Concerning the Right Use of the Fathers</span> (1651), he recalls that the book had been a favourite of Viscount Falkland, to whose unpublished papers he had access. A second translation from Daill&eacute;, <span class="italic">An Apologie for the Reformed Churches</span> (1653), has a long preface by Smith defending the Church of England, and Chillingworth in particular. In 1660 he published <span class="italic">Two Discourses Concerning Episcopacy</span> by Falkland and Chillingworth, and in the following year reprinted John Colet's <span class="italic">Sermon of Conforming and Reforming</span> with additional material by Henry Hammond and Lancelot Andrewes. These works demonstrate Smith's adherence to and love for the Anglican church in dark times.<br>
<br>Smith found his own place in church history through his disputes with the nonconformists George Whitehead and John Bunyan in 1659. In May Smith heard Bunyan preaching in a barn in Toft, outside Cambridge, and demanded to know who gave him authority to preach:<blockquote>The Church of Christ at <i>Bedford</i> &hellip; consisting only of women and a few Lay-men is not indeed a Church of Christ; none of them hath power to preach or administer the sacraments, and therefore none of them can give the Tinker power to preach and administer the Sacraments.</blockquote>Bunyan, thought Smith, subverted not only authority but also learning: &#145;Away (quoth he) to <i>Oxford</i> with your hell bred Logick&#146;  (Smith, sig. C3<i>v</i> and C<i>v</i>). Smith's challenge to Bunyan was published in his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Quaker Disarm'd</span> (1659), which was chiefly a record of his exchanges with the Quaker George Whitehead. Smith first encountered Whitehead in Westminster &#145;preaching against <i>Universities</i>, <i>Learning</i>, and <i>Tithes</i>, and the <i>Clergy</i>&#146;, and argued against him to no effect  (ibid., sig. A2<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In August 1659 Smith came across Whitehead again in Cambridge, preaching in the Quakers' meeting-house. Ever pugnacious rather than eirenic, Smith challenged him to a public debate, in which George Fox also participated. There he argued that Whitehead's preaching was heretical, focusing on his understanding of the Trinity, the Quakers' refusal to take oaths, and their lack of formal ordination. The debate provides a fascinating example of contrasting theological rhetoric, since Smith relies on syllogistic reasoning, with which the Quakers have some difficulty, while their more imaginative theological language is mockingly dismissed by Smith as nonsensical or papist.<br>
<br>The verbal debate was continued in a pamphlet skirmish, in which Smith's <span class="italic">The Quaker Disarm'd</span> and <span class="italic">A Gagg for the Quakers</span> (1659) were answered by Whitehead's <span class="italic">Truth Defending the Quakers</span> and his splendidly titled <span class="italic">The Key of Knowledge not Found in the University Library of Cambridge</span> (1660), along with contributions from others. As Whitehead realized, he and Smith understood quite different things by knowledge, and by authority. Thomas Smith was maintaining Anglican scholarship, episcopal ordination, catholic doctrine, and liturgical prayer, at a time when they were scorned by those who professed the freedom and inspiration of the Spirit. In his will, Smith expressed his &#145;desire to dye in the ancient Catholic &amp; Apostolic faith professed in the Church of England&#146; and to be buried &#145;without pomp or sermon but with the Liturgy of the English Church&#146;. By the time that will was signed, on All Saints' day 1660, Smith's beloved church had been restored, along with his king. He died the following year on 27 September 1661 &#145;of the new Desease which spreads all over England but is least in the north&#146; (as John Worthington recorded, Peile, 1.468), and was buried the same day at Kingston.<br>
