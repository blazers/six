<span class="headword">Bulman,  Oliver Meredith Boone</span>  (1902&#150;1974), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 20 May 1902 at Cheyne Walk Studio, Chelsea, London, the second of three children and younger son of Henry Herbert Bulman, artist, and his wife, Beatrice Elizabeth Boone (1864?&#150;1946?), daughter of W. A. Boone, of Canterbury and Ramsgate, art master of King's School, Canterbury. Of the three Bulman children, only Oliver appears to have inherited any graphic ability, and he used it very effectively when making, with his left hand, the hundreds of drawings and diagrams illustrating his scientific papers, books, and lectures; some people even collected his &#145;doodles&#146; after committee meetings.<br>
<br>Bulman went to Battersea grammar school in 1910, but an operation for a malignant cyst in his left femur kept him at home for a year when he was twelve years old. Wishing to study geology, which his school could not provide, he became an evening&#151;and later a day&#151;student at Chelsea Polytechnic as a pupil of A. J. Maslen. He gained the London University geology scholarship in 1920 and in 1921 he proceeded to Imperial College where he studied geology and zoology; he also attended vertebrate palaeontology lectures at University College, London. In 1923 he took a first-class BSc in geology, with zoology as the subsidiary subject, and also the ARCS.<br>
<br>Awarded a Beit scientific research fellowship, Bulman proceeded to a London PhD degree jointly with C. James Stubblefield with a thesis entitled &#145;The Shineton Shales of the Wrekin district, Shropshire&#146; (1926). He spent the first year of an 1851 senior studentship (1925&#150;6) at Imperial College where his fellow research students included Walter Frederick Whittard with whom he wrote a paper on Permian branchiosaurid amphibia. For the remaining two years of the studentship, he moved to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, to study dendroid graptolites under the supervision of Gertrude Lilian Elles at the Sedgwick Museum.<br>
<br>Bulman's researches were facilitated by following a technique devised by Gerhard Holm of using hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the rock matrix from the graptolite and also by making serial sections by grinding, as W. J. Sollas had done for <i>Palaeospondylus</i>. Bulman produced two parts of the Palaeontographical Society's monograph <span class="italic">British Dendroid Graptolites</span> (1927 and 1928) which, with several subsidiary papers, earned him a Cambridge PhD degree (1928). Bulman was awarded the Imperial College Huxley memorial medal when he returned there in 1928 as a demonstrator in the zoology department. He moved in 1929 to a similar post in the geology department; then in 1931 he became a demonstrator in geology at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Whereas previously Bulman had been elucidating the structure of dendroid graptolites, he turned to true graptolites when E. H. O. Stensi&ouml; of Stockholm placed with him for description a series of South American graptolites, isolated from their matrices by Holm. Assisted by Holm's skilfully retouched photographs, Bulman produced a spectacular paper published in the <span class="italic">Arkiv f&ouml;r Zoologie</span>. This paper was followed by a seven-part study of Scandinavian graptolites, also published in the <span class="italic">Arkiv</span>. Bulman provided new information concerning the early growth stages of graptolite taxa which had a bearing on the interpretation of the evolution of particular groups. Appreciation of his views was helped by the wax enlargements made from serial sections of the fossils. He contributed the article on graptolithina to the <span class="italic">Handbuch der Pal&auml;ozoologie</span> (ed. O. H. Schindewolf, 1938) but perhaps his most influential publication was the second edition (1970) of his <i>Graptolithina</i> volume (in part with R. B. Rickards) of the <span class="italic">Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology</span> (ed. C. Teichert).<br>
<br>At Chelsea Old Church, London, in 1938 Bulman married Marguerite, the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33100/', "William George Fearnsides FRS")</script>, professor of geology at Sheffield University, and his wife, Beatrix, daughter of Professor William Whitehead Watts FRS. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>After W. B. R. King became Woodwardian professor at Cambridge in 1943, Bulman was made reader in palaeozoology (1944). When King retired in 1955 Bulman succeeded to his post and occupied the chair until he resigned in 1966, when he became emeritus professor. He retained editorship of the <span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span>, which he had taken up in 1934, until 1972. With W. G. Fearnsides he was author of the sixpenny Penguin <span class="italic">Geology in the Service of Man</span> (1944; 3rd edn, 1961).<br>
<br>Elected FRS in 1940, Bulman served on the Royal Society's council from 1952 to 1954 and as a trustee of the British Museum (Natural History) from 1963 to 1970. He was successively president of the geology section of the British Association (1959), the Palaeontological Association (1960&#150;62), the Geological Society (1962&#150;4), and the Palaeontographical Society (1971&#150;4). He was a fellow of Sidney Sussex College (1944) and of Imperial College (1961). He received the Lyell medal of the Geological Society (1953) and an honorary DPhil of Oslo University (1965). He was ScD of Cambridge University (1936) and an honorary member of the Geological Society of Stockholm and of the Palaeontological Society of India. A volume of twenty essays on graptolites, by his students and friends, designed to form a Festschrift, but destined to be a memorial tribute to him, was published by the Palaeontological Association (1974) to which body he had given an inaugural address in 1958.<br>
<br>Bulman was 6 feet tall but sparsely built. Though he could strongly voice dislike of some, he was kindly and generous, and a staunch friend of others; he had a ready wit and was especially keen to help the careers of his students. He was a lucid and inspiring teacher. He died at his home, the White Cottage, Mount Pleasant, Cambridge, on 18 February 1974, and was cremated in Cambridge.<br>
