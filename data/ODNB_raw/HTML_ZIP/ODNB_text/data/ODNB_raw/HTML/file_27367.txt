<span class="headword">Thornton,  William Thomas</span>  (1813&#150;1880), <span class="occ">economist and civil servant</span>, born at Burnham, Buckinghamshire, on 14 February 1813, was the youngest son of the merchant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27363/', "Thomas Thornton (bap. 1767?, d. 1814)")</script> and his wife, Sophie Zohrab, daughter of a Greek merchant. Having been educated at the Moravian settlement at Ockbrook in Derbyshire, he spent three years in Malta with his cousin Sir William Henry Thornton, the auditor-general. From 1830 to 1835 he was in Constantinople with consul-general Cartwright, and in August 1836 he obtained a clerkship in the East India House. Twenty years later he was put in charge of the public works department, and in 1858 became first secretary for public works to the India Office. In 1873 he was created CB on the recommendation of the duke of Argyll. In spite of weak health, he devoted the greater part of his leisure to literary work, and more especially to the study of economic issues. He was a close friend of John Stuart Mill, and one of the most able adherents of Mill's school of political economy. But he differed widely from Mill on other subjects, and the friendship was based largely on a fondness for discussion  (A. Bain, <span class="italic">J. S. Mill</span>, 1882, 174). Thornton contributed to the <span class="italic">Examiner</span> of 17 May 1873 an account of Mill's work at the India House.<br>
<br>Thornton's first work on economics, which appeared in 1845, was <span class="italic">Over-Population and its Remedy</span>. His argument for the colonization of Irish wastes by Irish peasants was referred to in laudatory terms by Mill in his <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (1st edn, 392). Thornton attached little value to emigration, but argued strongly in favour of the subdivision of the land and against state intervention. The work did much to confute the views of John Ramsay McCulloch as to the effect of a wider distribution of landed property on the increase of population, and challenged then current notions as to the comparative prosperity of the labouring population in medieval and Victorian times. On the latter point Thornton's work was adversely criticized (probably by Herman Merivale) in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of January 1847.<br>
<br>Thornton developed his views in more detail in <span class="italic">A Plea for Peasant Proprietors, with the Outlines of a Plan for their Establishment in Ireland</span>, published in 1848. Mill read the proofs, and the book appeared a few weeks before his <span class="italic">Political Economy</span>, on which it had an important influence  (A. Bain, <span class="italic">J. S. Mill</span>, 86 n.). Thornton's book, which had gone out of print, came into request again during the discussion which attended the passing of the <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> of 1870. It was republished in 1874 with two additional chapters, one dealing with the &#145;Social and moral effects of peasant proprietorship&#146;  (chap. 4), and the other with &#145;Ireland: a forecast from 1873&#146;  (chap. 7). Thornton looked to the nationalization of the land as his ultimate ideal, but argued that the minimization of the evils of private ownership was all that was practical in the short term (chap. 7).<br>
<br>In 1869 Thornton published his most influential work on economics. The book, entitled <span class="italic">On Labour, its Wrongful Claims and Rightful Dues: its Actual Present and Possible Future</span>, presented critiques of both the classical approach to supply and demand theory and the wages-fund doctrine. In a review of the book in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> in the same year, John Stuart Mill argued against most of the criticisms levelled at supply and demand theory but accepted Thornton's argument against the predetermined nature of the wages-fund doctrine. Building on this, Mill went on to criticize and recant from the wages-fund doctrine. Mill's recantation, prompted by Thornton, has come to be regarded as a significant event in the decline of classical economics and has provoked numerous interpretations. In a second edition of <span class="italic">On Labour</span>, published in 1870, Thornton attempted to rebut Mill's criticisms of his analysis of supply and demand but incorporated some of Mill's recantation arguments concerning the wages-fund doctrine into his own discussion. A German translation by Heinrich Schramm was published in 1870.<br>
<br>Besides his works on economics, Thornton was the author of <span class="italic">Old-Fashioned Ethics and Common-Sense Metaphysics</span>, a volume of essays published in 1873, in which the ethical and teleological views of Hume, Huxley, and the utilitarians were adversely criticized; and of <span class="italic">Indian Public Works and Cognate Indian Topics</span> (1875). In 1854 he published a poem, &#145;The siege of Silistria&#146;, and in 1857 a volume of verse entitled <span class="italic">Modern Manichaeism, Labour's Utopia, and other Poems</span>. In 1878 he produced <span class="italic">Word for Word from Horace</span>, a literal verse translation of the <span class="roman">Odes</span>. The version showed a lack of metrical grasp, but was praised by Professor Robinson Ellis for seventeenth-century quaintness.<br>
<br>Thornton's last publication was, perhaps fittingly, a delayed review in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> (August 1879) of J. E. Cairnes's <span class="italic">Some Leading Principles of Political Economy Newly Expounded</span> (1874). In his volume Cairnes attempted an unsuccessful rehabilitation of the wages-fund doctrine. Once again Thornton's main point was that the wages fund was not predetermined. Thornton died at his home, 7 Cadogan Place, Sloane Street, London, on 17 June 1880. He left a son, Edward Zohrab Thornton.<br>
