<span class="headword">Coote,  Charles</span>, first earl of Mountrath  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1661), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6239/', "Sir Charles Coote, first baronet (d. 1642)")</script>, of Castle Coote, co. Roscommon, and Dorothea, daughter of Hugh Cuffe, of Cuffe's Wood or Cuffeswood, co. Cork. Little is known of his early years, but he was knighted in 1626 and in the 1630s he supported his father's work as provost-marshal of Connaught, and was returned as MP for Leitrim in the Irish parliament of 1640. Before 1630 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. in or before 1645), daughter of Sir Francis Ruish. He married second, before May 1645, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1684), daughter of Sir Robert Hannay, baronet.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Irish rising of 1641 Coote was left to defend the family estates in Connaught, while his father joined the main army at Dublin. When his father was killed in May 1642 Coote was nominated to succeed him as provost-marshal, and in February 1643 he joined a delegation to Oxford which tried to persuade Charles I to send supplies to the west of Ireland. The subsequent cessation of arms agreed between the king and the confederate Irish, and the appointment of lords Wilmot and Dillon as joint presidents of Connaught, seem to have confirmed Coote's doubts about royalist intentions. In April 1644 he was one of the protestant agents who attended the king once again, demanding that he repudiate the cessation of arms, condemn popery, confiscate rebel estates, and impose further plantation in Ireland. Their proposals caused consternation at Oxford, and Coote and his colleagues were accused of intending &#145;only scandal upon the king and his ministers&#146;  (Lord Digby to Ormond, 6 May 1644, Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 10, fol. 532). The agents received a warmer reception in London, and by August Coote had declared his support for the parliamentarian cause.<br>
<br>In October 1644 Coote was nominated by parliament as their lord president of Connaught, and the post was confirmed in February 1645. In the interim he joined Sir Robert King, Sir John Temple, and other Irish protestants in advising parliament on its Irish policy. In May 1645 he was finally given leave to return to Ireland, and joined forces with the &#145;Laggan&#146; army in western Ulster, with whom he recaptured Sligo, and advanced into Connaught, capturing eighteen towns by the end of the year. In the spring of 1646 Coote and his allies persuaded Viscount Ranelagh to defect to parliament, and narrowly failed to arrange a mutiny at Athlone. In May he besieged the earl of Clanricarde in Portumna Castle in southern Galway. Coote's successes were soon shattered by the defeat of the Ulster Scots at Benburb in June 1646. He withdrew to Belfast, and begged parliament to send effective support to northern Ireland. The independents, who now controlled Irish affairs through the new lord lieutenant, Viscount Lisle, tried to conciliate Coote, but they were more concerned to send reinforcements to Dublin and the Munster garrisons. In March 1647 Coote sent agents to parliament to bring the &#145;very sad condition&#146; of Connaught to their notice, and to &#145;prevent that torrent which carrieth all to Munster&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.366, 379). After Lisle's commission ended in April, Coote received more help from Westminster. In July &pound;8000 was allocated to Connaught, and in October Coote was appointed vice-admiral of the province. The threat of Irish intervention in the second civil war prompted parliament to send further supplies, and Coote was made governor of Londonderry.<br>
<br>The trial and execution of Charles I seem to have made little impact on Coote. During the winter of 1648&#150;9 he joined the Ulster commander George Monck in a purge of the British officer corps, and he imposed the engagement on Londonderry soon afterwards. These moves did not go unchallenged, however, and in May 1649 Coote was besieged in Londonderry by his former allies in the Laggan regiments. Relief was slow in arriving, and when he was eventually reinforced the immediate danger had passed. From early 1650 Coote played a crucial role in bringing northern Ireland under parliament's control. He defeated an Irish army at Scarrifhollis in July 1650, and, working with the New Model brigade under Robert Venables, ravaged Ulster, before invading Connaught in 1651, capturing Athlone and Portumna, and, after a long siege, taking the surrender of Galway in April 1652. Despite his victories, Coote was criticized by the parliamentary commissioners, who thought the Galway articles too lenient. They were also suspicious of his continuing association with the Ulster Scots and with former royalists. It was not a surprise when most of Coote's northern regiments (including those under the command of his three brothers) were disbanded in the reduction of the Irish army in 1653.<br>
<br>Coote retained the presidency of Connaught, however, and during the later 1650s he was able to extend his political influence over much of Connaught and western Ulster. In the elections for the protectorate parliaments of 1654, 1656, and 1659 he was able to return his own candidates to at least six seats in each parliament. He himself was elected for Galway and Mayo, although he only took his seat in 1659. During this period he also became allied to a number of men of national importance, including Lord Broghill (Roger Boyle), Sir Hardress Waller, and William Jephson. Of particular importance was his friendship with Henry Cromwell, who governed Ireland from the summer of 1655. In October 1656, for example, Henry Cromwell supported Coote's efforts to secure the renewal of his patent as lord president; a year later he recommended Coote for a peerage and a seat in the &#145;other house&#146;, although without success. Coote soon returned the favour: in 1658 he acted as Henry Cromwell's agent in the settlement of his newly acquired estates in Galway, and in the 1659 parliament he was a staunch supporter of the protectorate, and acted as teller in favour of recognizing the other house.<br>
<br>The fall of the protectorate in May 1659 left Coote vulnerable. He was reappointed as colonel of foot by the republican regime in July 1659, but he did not support the new government, and was involved in the coup of December 1659, capturing Galway for the Irish officers. In January 1660 he was appointed one of five commissioners to govern Ireland for parliament, and he was a central figure in the Dublin Convention. It was during the meeting of the convention that Coote began to support the restoration of the monarchy as the best option for stability in Ireland. As early as the summer of 1659 he had been accused of &#145;declaring for the Scot's king's interest&#146;  (Warner, <span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 4.156), and he worked closely with his former colleague George Monck during the winter of 1659&#150;60, but his first direct contact with the court in exile came only in February 1660, when he sent Sir Arthur Forbes to wait on Charles II in the Netherlands. A reply, acknowledging his support, was penned by the king in March.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Coote was well rewarded. In July 1660 he was reappointed president of Connaught; in August his estates were confirmed; and in September he was created Baron Coote of Castle Cuffe, Viscount Coote of Castle Coote, and earl of Mountrath. As lord justice of Ireland from October 1660, he governed Ireland with Lord Broghill (now earl of Orrery) and Sir Maurice Eustace. During 1661 he proved an effective manager of the Irish parliament, influencing elections and steering proceedings to ensure that (in his own words) &#145;all things are now fully restored to their ancient order&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2537, fol. 345). His death in Dublin from smallpox on 18 December 1661 was (according to Orrery), &#145;a great blow to this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1660&#150;62</i>, 479). This was not an exaggeration. In the following months, the rule of the lords justices gave way to the lieutenancy of the duke of Ormond, and the Irish protestants found their ambitions increasingly frustrated. Mountrath was buried on 6 February 1662 at St Patrick's Cathedral; he was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles, from his first marriage. He was survived by his wife, who afterwards married Sir Robert Reading, bt.<br>
