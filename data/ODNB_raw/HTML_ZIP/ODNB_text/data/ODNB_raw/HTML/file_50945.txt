<span class="headword">Florence,  Philip Sargant</span>  (1890&#150;1982), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 25 June 1890 at Nutley, New Jersey, USA, the son of Henry Smythe Florence and his wife, Mary Sargant-Florence. He was an American citizen, but spent most of his life in Britain. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69424/', "Alix Strachey")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52777/', "Strachey, James Beaumont")</script>] was his sister. After attending Rugby School, he entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1909 as a history scholar, and obtained a first-class degree in economics in 1914. He then studied at Columbia University, New York, where he took his PhD degree with a thesis on the effects of fatigue on the productivity of workers. He married an American, Lella Faye Secor, in New York in 1917, and she became his close companion until her death in 1966. They had two sons.<br>
<br>After committee work in Britain and the USA, Sargant Florence returned to Cambridge University as a lecturer in economics in 1921 and stayed there until 1929, when he was appointed professor of commerce at the University of Birmingham. He was dean of the faculty of commerce and social science at Birmingham from 1947 to 1950, and retired in 1955. He remained active in retirement, taking visiting professorships in the United States, at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Rhode Island, and serving on a number of committees. From 1972 until his death he was a vice-president of the Royal Economic Society. He was appointed an honorary CBE in 1952.<br>
<br>Sargant Florence was a lively Cambridge undergraduate, much influenced by his contemporary C. K. Ogden, who interested him in words and their meaning. This was later reflected in Florence's <span class="italic">Basic English for the Social Sciences</span> (1962). At Cambridge he was a founder of the Heretics Society, and served as its secretary until 1914. He also helped to found the <span class="italic">Cambridge Magazine</span> and served on its editorial committee. His mother, Mary, was one of its contributors.<br>
<br>Sargant Florence was much interested in social as well as economic questions, having served on the British Association committee on fatigue from the economic standpoint (1913&#150;15), and as investigator to the Health of Munitions Workers Committee (1915&#150;16). In the USA he was an investigator for the US public health service (1917&#150;21), and lecturer for the bureau of industrial research and bureau of personnel administration, New York (1919&#150;21). His first book, published in 1918, was <span class="italic">Use of Factory Statistics in the Investigation of Factory Fatigue</span>. The title of this book displayed another of his main interests&#151;the statistical study of industrial problems. This was reflected directly in his <span class="italic">Statistical Method in Economics and Political Science</span> (1929), and in his many works on the economics of industry. For example, his <span class="italic">Ownership, Control and Success of Large Companies, 1936&#150;51</span> (1961) was a pioneering and detailed study of the concentration of ownership in British industry, including details of directors, ownership, dividend policy, financial success, and an analysis of very large companies. Perhaps his best-known work, again involving many statistical comparisons, was his <span class="italic">Logic of British and American Industry</span> (1953, revised 1971). His width of interests was reflected not only in his books, but also in articles published in sociological, statistical, and psychological, as well as economic, journals.<br>
<br>Sargant Florence soon became well known in the midlands, and became an influential figure both in the university and in midlands industry. These interests were temporarily suspended by the Second World War, when he and his wife, both American citizens, were evacuated to the United States, where he acted for a while as consultant to the national resources planning board. On returning to Britain during the war he joined the staff of the American ambassador, John Winant.<br>
<br>After the war Sargant Florence resumed his university duties, and undertook wide-ranging investigations in the midlands connected with post-war reconstruction, especially town and country planning. He published, among other works, <span class="italic">Country Town</span> (1946), a study of Worcester; <span class="italic">English County</span> (1947), an inquiry into the industries of Herefordshire; and <span class="italic">Conurbation</span>, a report on regional planning in Birmingham and the Black Country. From 1957 to 1963 he presided over the Greater Birmingham employment committee, and remained active as an author, academic, and committee member well into old age. His work for Birmingham University was recognized by his honorary degree of DSocSc (Birmingham), and his reputation in America was recognized by his honorary LittD (Humanities) (Columbia).<br>
<br>Sargant Florence was a man of many and varied interests, who infected all around him with his lively mind, his <i>joie de vivre</i>, and his delightful and witty personality. He was no theoretical economist, though he did develop an interest in macroeconomics in his old age, but he made many contributions, both academically and practically, through his extensive work in the midlands, to improving industry and the conditions of its workers. He was always interested in local and national politics, and was a member of the Labour Party, at least for a time. But he was no enemy of capitalism, believing that its strength may lie in its very variety and balance of power, allowing the fittest for the given circumstances to dominate. Florence died at Highfield, Birmingham, on 29 January 1982, and was cremated at Lodge Hill crematorium.<br>
