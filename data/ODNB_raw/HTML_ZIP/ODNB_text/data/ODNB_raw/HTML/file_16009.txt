<span class="headword">Langdale <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Stourton]</span>,  Charles</span>  (1787&#150;1868), <span class="occ">politician and biographer</span>, was born on 19 September 1787, the fourth son of the six sons and six daughters of Charles Philip, seventeenth Baron Stourton (1752&#150;1816), and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1841), second surviving daughter and coheir of Marmaduke Langdale, fifth and last Baron Langdale. In January 1799 he was sent to Oscott College, which he left in August 1804. In October of the same year he entered Stonyhurst College, where he finished his studies. On 24 December 1814 he assumed his mother's maiden name by royal licence, in order to comply with the conditions of the will of Philip Langdale of Houghton, Yorkshire. On 27 January 1817 he married Charlotte Mary, fifth daughter of the sixth Baron Clifford. She died on 31 March 1819, leaving him two daughters. On 1 May 1821 he married again; his second wife was May (<i>d</i>. 1857), eldest daughter of Marmaduke Constable of Everingham Park. They had a large family of at least five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Langdale soon became active and prominent in politics and public life. He appeared on platforms in London with other leading Catholic laymen to campaign for the emancipation of Roman Catholics in England from the legal restraints which had been imposed upon them since the Reformation. After the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Act</span> was passed in 1829 he became one of the first Roman Catholics in the Commons, sitting for Beverley in 1832&#150;5 and for Knaresborough in 1837&#150;41. On the return of the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span> to the Commons in 1834 he moved and carried a resolution that the clause securing religious freedom in the workhouses, which had been struck out by the Lords, should be reinstated. He voted for the ballot, the repeal of the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span>, and for an inquiry into the pensions list; he was also involved in negotiations for the repeal of the remaining enactments against Catholics in the 1840s.<br>
<br>Langdale's most significant efforts, however, were in the field of Roman Catholic education, where he became &#145;the most important Catholic educationalist of the century&#146;  (Norman, 167). In 1838 he chaired the first meeting of the Catholic Institute, a society intended to circulate pro-Catholic tracts and to improve Roman Catholic education by promoting lectures and libraries. In 1847 he suggested and supported the foundation of the Catholic Poor Schools Committee, of which he was chairman (and the only recusant member) until his death. The activities of this effective and influential body included supporting the growth of the teaching orders and organizing training for lay teachers. Langdale's most important contribution to its work was made in the mid-1840s, when he was the leading figure in negotiations with the government to secure a share in public grants and other educational amenities for Roman Catholic schools.<br>
<br>During the 1850 &#145;papal aggression&#146; crisis Langdale publicly testified to his belief in the patronage and protection of the Virgin and the saints at a large public meeting in York. In the mid-1850s he became involved in another controversy. Lord Holland's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Whig Party</span>, which were published posthumously in 1852, contained an assertion that Maria Fitzherbert, the reputed wife of George IV, had never believed her marriage vows to be in any way binding. Langdale, who had been a close friend of Mrs Fitzherbert in his youth, determined to write a defence. He applied for permission to see Mrs Fitzherbert's remaining papers, including her marriage certificate, which were held in Coutts's Bank and of which his brother, Lord Stourton (<i>d</i>. 1846), had been a trustee. The representative of the longest surviving trustee, however, refused him access, and Langdale was obliged to base his vindication solely on Mrs Fitzherbert's personal recollections, dictated to Lord Stourton. The <span class="italic">Memoirs of Mrs Fitzherbert</span> were published in 1856; only fifty copies were produced, but Langdale's narrative served to establish the religious validity of the marriage in the eyes of the Roman Catholic church, and to show that Mrs Fitzherbert firmly believed herself to be the wife of the prince regent.<br>
<br>Langdale died on 1 December 1868 at 5 Queen Street, Mayfair, London, having been admitted shortly before as a lay brother of the Society of Jesus. He was buried at Houghton, the family seat, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles Joseph Langdale (1822&#150;1895). Father Peter Gallwey, who preached at the funeral, dwelt on his personal spiritual life, which was one of regular devotion and relative poverty, describing him as &#145;a father to us all&#146;  (Gallwey, 21). Langdale was a significant figure in liberal Catholic politics until his death. Bernard Ward, describing him as &#145;a leader in all catholic good works&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eve of Catholic Emancipation</span>, 3.282), identified Langdale and John Talbot, sixteenth earl of Shrewsbury, as the outstanding Roman Catholic figures in post-1829 politics. Langdale has been unduly neglected in modern scholarship on Roman Catholic politics and religion in the first half of the nineteenth century.<br>
