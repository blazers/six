<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cook, Sir  Edward Tyas</span>  (1857&#150;1919), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, born on 12 May 1857, at Brighton, was the youngest son of Silas Kemball Cook, secretary of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, and his wife, Emily Archer, proprietor of a preparatory school. He was educated at Winchester, of which college he was elected a fellow in 1903, and New College, Oxford. He was president of the Oxford Union (1879), and graduated with a double first in 1880. In 1881 he joined the Inner Temple, but he never took his bar finals. University contemporaries admired Cook's abilities and character and it was assumed that he would enjoy a brilliant career in politics. Immediately upon leaving Oxford he acted as secretary of the London Society for Extension of University Teaching (1882&#150;5). He unsuccessfully applied for a number of appointments but turned down an offer to enter the civil service. His long-held ambition was to become a journalist, and he made occasional contributions to a variety of journals, including <span class="italic">Truth</span>, the <span class="italic">Oxford Chronicle</span>, and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. In August 1888 Cook accepted a part-time editorial post on the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, later succeeding Alfred Milner, a lifelong friend, as W. T. Stead's assistant editor. Cook always acknowledged the debt he owed to Stead, and in his turn as editor applied some of Stead's ideas. But as a writer his methods were the opposite of Stead's; he relied upon quiet, incisive argument, not emphatic assertion and remonstrance. Cook was always a copious writer. His approach to any subject was cool, methodical, and cautious; his style, crisp and analytical. Those who engaged him in controversy rapidly discovered the rich variety of polemical weapons he effortlessly commanded, and the deadly accuracy of his tenacious memory for recondite facts.<br>
<br>In 1889, when Stead resigned as editor of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, Cook was appointed his successor. Although his rule was to last scarcely twenty-one months, Cook made his mark as a conscientious editor. In Henry Massingham's informed opinion, Cook made the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> a &#145;young man's paper&#146;  (Massingham, 188); certainly most of the leading contributors were under the age of forty. On social issues the paper took a more advanced line than the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, but Cook maintained Stead's enthusiastic support for a &#145;big&#146; navy and Liberal Imperialist measures. W. W. Astor's purchase of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in the tory interest obliged Cook and his political staff to resign. With the financial backing of George Newnes, they were able to launch the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> in January 1893. It was intended to carry on the journalistic and political traditions of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. Again Cook's tenancy as editor was short-lived, for in 1895 he was offered and accepted the editorship of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, a newspaper that earlier, in conversation with Newnes, he had disdained as a mere party mouthpiece. The veteran manager and effective political editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, Sir John Robinson, was amazed by Cook's appointment and acquiesced in it only grudgingly. Under Cook's stewardship, sales of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> continued to fall. Cook declared that as editor it was his duty to keep &#145;steadily in view the larger interests and duties of the country&#146;, and to ignore &#145;mere party considerations in the face of national emergency&#146;  (Koss, 1.399). By this he meant that, despite war in South Africa, he would continue to express his strong imperialist sympathies. This brought him into direct conflict with the radical, Little Englander wing of the Liberal Party. The consequence was inevitable. In January 1901, when the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> was sold to new proprietors, including George Cadbury, the Quaker, Cook was abruptly dismissed. Effectively he was banished to the political wilderness for remaining attached to a philosophy&#151;imperialism&#151;that had become thoroughly discredited. Cook was unrepentant and remained an unreformed Roseberyite Liberal. Nor did he make any secret of his continued admiration for Alfred Milner. When he departed from the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, he was offered refuge as a leader writer by the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, an undistinguished, halfpenny newspaper. He stayed there until 1910, but his heart was never in the task. He gave the best of himself in those years before the outbreak of the First World War to the editing of Ruskin's writings. Cook's admiration for Ruskin had begun in boyhood and never wavered; he was assisted in his monumental enterprise by Alexander Wedderburn. The <span class="italic">Works</span> (1903&#150;11), in thirty-nine substantial volumes, remain the definitive edition of Ruskin's writings. As J. A. Spender noted, it was Ruskin's &#145;great good fortune&#146; that he, &#145;the most copious and unrestrained of English writers&#146;, should enjoy as his editor and biographer &#145;the coolest, most cautious, most critical of writers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, 2 Oct 1919). Cook's <span class="italic">Ruskin</span> (1911) was followed by other successful biographies, <span class="italic">Florence Nightingale</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">Delane of The Times</span> (1915).<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Cook was recruited to play a part in Britain's propaganda campaign. To the Oxford series he contributed a pamphlet, <span class="italic">How Britain Strove for Peace</span> (1914), designed to demonstrate Germany's war guilt. On 6 August 1914, Winston Churchill announced the setting up of a press bureau, a hasty improvisation. In 1915, with Sir Frank Swettenham, Cook was appointed joint director. It was no sinecure. The original aim of the bureau had been to guide rather than restrict newspaper coverage of the war, but the Admiralty and War Office proved stubborn and recalcitrant partners in an enterprise that, in Cook's own words, &#145;was never constituted at all&#151;&#147;it growed&#148;&#151;left to work out its scope and methods as experience might suggest&#146;  (Cook, introduction). The respect in which Cook was held by fellow journalists, his wisdom, and his untiring energy allowed a difficult task to be performed with the minimum of friction. The unremitting industry of the war years undoubtedly undermined his health. He left a dispassionate and balanced essay, <span class="italic">The Press in War-Time: with some Account of the Official Press Bureau</span> (1920), which was published posthumously.<br>
<br>In 1884 Cook married Emily Constance Baird; theirs was a happy marriage, but there were no children. Emily died in 1903. Cook was knighted in 1912, and made a KBE in 1917. In 1918 he suffered a stroke. The following year he developed pleurisy and then pneumonia. He died at his much-loved country home, Rose Cottage in South Stoke, Oxfordshire, on 30 September 1919.<br>
<br>In late Victorian and Edwardian London, Cook was one of the most influential journalists. He took a high view of journalism as a profession, although his claim to exercise complete independence as an editor was exaggerated. Though a convinced Liberal he was never afraid to criticize his party. A reserved, shy, silent man, he was a most generous and loyal friend.<br>
