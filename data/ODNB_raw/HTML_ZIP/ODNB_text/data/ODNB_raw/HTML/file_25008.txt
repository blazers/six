<span class="headword">Seddon,  John</span>  (1724&#150;1770), <span class="occ">dissenting minister and tutor</span>, was born at Hereford on 8 December 1724, the son of Peter Seddon (<i>d</i>. 1760), dissenting minister successively at Ormskirk and Hereford, and his wife, Elizabeth Eckley. He was a second cousin of John Seddon (1719&#150;1769), minister at Cross Street, Manchester, with whom he has often been confused. In 1742 he was admitted to Kendal dissenting academy, under Caleb Rotheram, and in 1744 he matriculated from Glasgow University, where he was a favourite pupil of Francis Hutcheson and William Leechman. On finishing his studies he succeeded Charles Owen as minister of Cairo Street Chapel, Warrington, and was ordained there on 8 December 1747. He proved to be a popular minister and soon attracted the attendance of the Percival family, who left the established church and later engaged him as private tutor to Thomas Percival (1740&#150;1804). Percival later wrote of Seddon &#145;As a gentleman, a scholar, a preacher, a companion and a friend, he was almost without an equal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 1810, 430).<br>
<br>Following the closure of the dissenting academies at Kendal in 1753 and Findern, Derbyshire, in 1754, a project was launched in July 1754 to establish by subscription a dissenting academy in the north of England, primarily to educate candidates for the ministry. Seddon was a prime mover in the scheme and his skill and perseverance at drumming up support from local merchants no doubt contributed to the trustees' decision to locate the school in Warrington rather than Ormskirk. On 30 June 1757 he was elected secretary and Hugh Willoughby of Parham accepted the invitation to become president of the academy. When the academy opened on 20 October, Seddon was appointed librarian; his former pupil Thomas Percival was the first student to be enrolled. In addition to divinity students Warrington also took fee-paying private pupils, who were offered an education that would prepare them for a professional or commercial career. On 19 July that year Seddon married Sarah Hoskins at St Philip's, Birmingham; according to Job Orton she was the daughter of a deceased equerry to Frederick, prince of Wales. They had no children.<br>
<br>Seddon soon fell out with John Taylor, professor of divinity and moral philosophy at Warrington, whose prickly character was such that he took offence at what he saw as Seddon's interference. As secretary, Seddon liaised between the tutors and the management committee and sat in on the tutors' meetings; and as librarian he approved every book purchase. Moreover Taylor did not share the high opinion of Hutchesonian metaphysics that Seddon had acquired at Glasgow and they took opposing sides in a local controversy respecting forms of prayer. On 3 July 1750 a group of dissenting ministers from the north-west met at Warrington to consider introducing set forms into dissenting worship and a subsequent meeting at Preston on 10 September 1751 declared in favour of &#145;a proper variety of public devotional offices&#146;.<br>
<br>The following year the provincial assembly set up a committee to decide the matter and a long controversy ensued. When on 16 October 1760 a number of dissenters in Liverpool, led by the porcelain manufacturer Thomas Bentley, decided to build a chapel for liturgical worship and invited several dissenting ministers to prepare a prayer book, Taylor declined and Seddon accepted. On 6 January 1762 at a meeting at the Merchants' Coffee House in Liverpool, Seddon submitted &#145;the new liturgy&#146;, which was published as <span class="italic">A form of prayer and a new collection of psalms, for the use of a congregation of protestant dissenters in Liverpool</span> (1763). Edited by Seddon, the new liturgy was written by Philip Holland and Richard Godwin (1722&#150;1787), minister at Gateacre, near Liverpool, and was used in the Octagon Chapel, Liverpool, which opened in 1763. Seddon declined to become minister at the Octagon Chapel and chose not to use the liturgy in his own ministry, preferring extempore prayer.<br>
<br>Seddon regarded Warrington Academy as &#145;his favourite child&#146; and Taylor's complaints about his interference may have been justified for, according to William Turner, Seddon was &#145;somewhat too meddling, and perhaps occasionally assuming, in his intercourse with the Tutors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 8.190). However, his dynamic influence on the academy was a crucial factor in maintaining its success. In 1762 he toured the major cities in England, visiting dissenting congregations, in an attempt to encourage subscriptions and to recruit more fee-paying pupils. His carefully kept accounts and minutes show that the academy's fortunes revived, albeit temporarily, and he turned his attention to another problem. Discipline was always a difficulty at the academy and in 1767 he was appointed to the newly created office of &#145;rector academiae&#146;. One of his new duties was to take a weekly register of the students in order to encourage regular attendance. At the same time he succeeded Joseph Priestley in the chair of belles lettres, with a salary of &pound;100 plus the fees from private pupils attending his lectures. Despite his own financial problems (he had lost his wife's fortune by investing it in a calico-printing works at Stockport) Seddon accepted only half of the salary as he was aware that the academy could little afford to pay the full salary. An excellent orator, he lectured on language, oratory, theology, and philosophy.<br>
<br>Outside the academy Seddon was a co-founder and the first president of Warrington Public Library (1758) and the first secretary of the Lancashire and Cheshire Widows' Fund (1764). He died suddenly after suffering a seizure while out riding at Warrington on 23 January 1770 and was buried in Cairo Street Chapel; he was survived by his wife.<br>
