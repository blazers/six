<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Willis,  Francis</span>  (1718&#150;1807), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born on 17 August 1718, was the third son of John Willis, a vicar of Lincoln Cathedral, and his wife, Genevra, daughter of James Darling of Oxford. On 30 May 1734 he matriculated from Lincoln College, Oxford. He migrated to St Alban Hall and graduated BA on 21 March 1739, and on 10 February 1741 he proceeded MA from Brasenose College, of which he became a fellow and in due course vice-principal. Agreeing to his father's wishes, he took holy orders, but he had developed a strong leaning towards medicine, studying it even while an undergraduate and attending the lectures of Nathan Alcock, who became a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>In 1749 Willis married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1797), youngest daughter of the Revd John Curtois of Bramston, Lincolnshire, and they took up residence at Dunston in that county. Apparently Willis practised medicine without a licence before Oxford University conferred on him the degrees of BM and DM in 1759. He played an active part in the founding of the Lincoln General Hospital, and was appointed physician there in 1769. For the following six years he regularly attended it twice a week; his successful treatment of several cases of mental derangement resulted in patients being brought to him from great distances. To accommodate them he moved to a larger house at Greatford, near Stamford, and set up a private lunatic asylum, which attracted a superior clientele. Visiting it, Frederick Reynolds noted that<blockquote>the unprepared traveller &hellip; was astonished to find almost all the surrounding ploughmen, gardeners, threshers, thatchers, and other labourers, attired in black coats, white waistcoats, black silk breeches and stockings, and the head of each <i>bien poudr&eacute;e, fris&eacute;e et arrang&eacute;e</i>. These were the doctor's patients. (Reynolds, 154)</blockquote>George III experienced his first attack of madness in autumn 1788, and as his condition worsened and the physicians-in-ordinary, such as Sir George Baker, proved unable to cope or cure, Willis (then seventy) was called in on 5 December 1788, on the recommendation of Lady Harcourt, whose mother he had treated. Partly because he insisted upon exercising exclusive medical control, Willis encountered bitter opposition from the regular physicians. They regarded him as little better than a quack&#151;he was, after all, a clergyman and not a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and running a lunatic asylum was still a rather disreputable activity. Others at court were more approving: Fanny Burney described him as &#145;a man of ten thousand; open, honest, dauntless, light-hearted, innocent, and high-minded&#146;  (Barrett, 4.215); while Hannah More called him &#145;the very image of simplicity, quite a good, plain, old-fashioned country parson&#146;  (Roberts, 2.144).<br>
<br>From the first Willis expressed his confidence that the king would recover if he, the doctor, were allowed to follow his favourite methods of moral management, involving complete physical and psychological domination over his patient. Madness, he believed, was essentially a product of over-excitation; hence the chief priorities were calmness and control. A man of vast faith in his own powers, Willis, with the aid of his eldest son, John, and attendants brought from Greatford, proved fearless in asserting his authority over the king, when necessary using a straitjacket, a gag, and a restraining chair upon his royal patient, along with a quasi-mesmerizing technique of fixing his patient with his eye. The equerry Robert Fulke Greville recorded how he was impressed &#145;with the proper manner and the imposing stile [<i>sic</i>] of the authoritative language which Dr Willis held&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 120). Yet alongside intimidation Willis also recognized the importance of winning the king's trust and co-operation; in due course, he permitted his patient to read Shakespeare and to shave himself and pare his nails with a penknife. The king resented Willis's bullying ways but proved responsive to his optimism.<br>
<br>By February 1789 the king had largely recovered (it has been argued by Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter that this was a spontaneous recovery from a bout of porphyria, and had little to do with Willis's therapies; the matter is disputed) and Willis was quick to claim the credit. A grateful Prime Minister Pitt, spared the prospect of a regency, ensured that parliament voted the mad-doctor a pension of &pound;1000 a year for twenty-one years. Willis himself had medallions struck with the inscription: &#145;Britons Rejoice, Your King's Restored&#146;.<br>
<br>Achieving fame, Willis was soon called in to treat the queen of Portugal, apparently receiving &pound;20,000 for his ministrations. He then returned to his private practice, building a second madhouse at Shillingthorpe, near Greatford, to accommodate the expanding numbers of his patients. His first wife died on 17 April 1797 and he then married Mrs Storer. Not long afterwards, still practising medicine, Willis died, in his ninetieth year, on 5 December 1807, at Greatford; he was buried there on 13 December, where a monument to his memory was erected by his surviving sons. His second wife also survived him.<br>
<br>Willis wrote little. &#145;The case of a shepherd near Lincoln&#146;, which was &#145;published at the request of the Rev. Mr. Willis&#146;, appeared in Robert James's <span class="italic">Dissertation on Fevers and Inflammatory Distempers</span> (8th edn, 1778, 28&#150;9); Willis also produced &#145;An account of an extraordinary case of a lady, who swallowed euphorbium&#146;, in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (51, 1760, 662&#150;9). He belonged to the generation of mad-doctors whose personal influence was greater than their literary fame. Willis was portrayed in Alan Bennett's play <span class="italic">The Madness of George III</span> (1991), which was adapted for the cinema as <span class="italic">The Madness of King George</span> (1994).<br>
<br>Willis and his first wife had five sons; of these John (1751&#150;1835) attended George III in 1788, with Willis, and again in 1811 alone; Thomas (1754&#150;1827) was prebendary of Rochester, rector of St George's, Bloomsbury, and of Wateringbury, Kent; Richard (1755&#150;1829) became an admiral in the Royal Navy; and Robert Darling (1760&#150;1821) attended the king during his second attack of madness, and was father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29584/', "Robert Willis (1800&#150;1875)")</script>, who became professor of applied mechanics at Cambridge University.<br>
