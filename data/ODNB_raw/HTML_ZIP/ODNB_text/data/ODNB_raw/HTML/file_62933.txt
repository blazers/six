<span class="headword">Ryan,  Frederick Michael</span>  (1873&#150;1913), <span class="occ">playwright and journalist</span>, was born at 8 Brunswick Place, Dublin, on 12 October 1873, the son of John Ryan, a bookkeeper, from whom he inherited his radicalism, and Catherine Davis. On leaving school he became a clerk in the civil service in London, where he frequented Fabian Society lectures and performances of Ibsen's plays. He resigned his position after a year because of ill health and joined the Dublin accountants Craig, Gardner &amp; Co., where the stage-struck Frank Fay was a fellow clerk.<br>
<br>On 6 March 1896 Ryan was elected a member of the Celtic Society, founded by Arthur Griffith and William Rooney to stimulate debate on Irish affairs, and a forerunner of the Sinn F&eacute;in party. Later that year he also joined James Connolly's Irish Socialist Republican Party (ISRP), although he did not remain an active member of either society for long; the factionalism in the ISRP frustrated him, and he found himself growing out of sympathy with Griffith's bourgeois nationalism and racialism.<br>
<br>Ryan's friendship with Frank and William Fay led him to join their amateur Ormonde Dramatic Society in 1901, and in April 1902 he took a small part in their production of plays by George Russell and W. B. Yeats which led to the establishment of the Irish National Theatre Society. Ryan was elected secretary of the new society on 8 August, a position he held with great efficiency until 1904, when he became treasurer. He also turned his hand to playwriting, and his Ibsenite drama, <span class="italic">The Laying of the Foundations</span>, on the theme of municipal corruption, was produced on 12 October 1902, revived early in December, and performed on the Irish National Theatre Society's first visit to London on 2 May 1903.<br>
<br>Being secretary to the theatre did nothing to stem Ryan's constant flow of letters and articles to the Dublin and London press, usually under his pen-name Irial or Finian. His contributions to Griffith's <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> criticized the paper's refusal to see the Irish struggle from an international perspective, and in 1904 he vigorously attacked Griffith's antisemitism. Growing weary of the orthodoxy and superficiality of Irish journals, he and John Eglinton launched <span class="italic">Dana</span>, &#145;A Magazine of Independent Thought&#146; in 1904, to promote the interchange of progressive ideas. The work of many leading writers of the Irish literary revival appeared in this monthly, including a poem by James Joyce&#151;although the editors rejected an early version of <span class="italic">A Portrait of the Artist</span>. The magazine folded after less than a year, but Ryan had contributed enough articles in this time to make up his only book, <span class="italic">Criticism and Courage</span> (1906), and, deprived of his own journal, he continued to publish in <span class="italic">The Nationist</span> and the <span class="italic">New Age</span>.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Yeats was transforming the Irish National Theatre Society into a professional company, with power vested in three directors. Although opposed to this suppression of democracy, Ryan helped redraft the constitution, but voted against its adoption at the general meeting and subsequently resigned from the society. He helped other seceders set up a rival Theatre of Ireland in 1906 but, tired of theatrical quarrels, soon withdrew altogether from the Irish dramatic movement. His attempts with like-minded colleagues to establish a &#145;national democratic committee&#146; in 1906 were abandoned with the sudden death of Michael Davitt, the proposed chairman, and as an alternative Ryan set up the Dublin Philosophic Society, which arranged a series of public lectures on rationalist themes. Early in 1907 he started the <span class="italic">National Democrat</span> with Francis Sheehy-Skeffington to carry on the committee's work in another form; this penny monthly ran for seven issues and its demise left Ryan much out of pocket.<br>
<br>With the failure of this venture Ryan left Dublin for Cairo to take up the assistant editorship of the anti-imperialist <span class="italic">Egyptian Standard</span>, but returned to Ireland in April 1909 to write against vested commercial and clerical interests in the <span class="italic">Irish Nation</span>. In June 1909 he helped William O'Brien reorganize the Socialist Party of Ireland of which he subsequently became secretary. He also served as secretary to the committee of the Young Ireland branch of the United Irish League. When James Connolly returned permanently to Ireland in July 1910, he immediately called on Ryan, who later found him supplementary employment which subsidized his trade union work. Early in 1911 Ryan returned to London to edit Wilfrid Scawen Blunt's monthly review <span class="italic">Egypt</span>, but on 3 April 1913, while in Sussex to discuss the future of the periodical with Blunt, he was taken ill with appendicitis. He died on 7 April at New Buildings Place, Shipley Road, Billingshurst, after an emergency operation. Although a confirmed agnostic, he was buried in the Crawley monastery churchyard.<br>
