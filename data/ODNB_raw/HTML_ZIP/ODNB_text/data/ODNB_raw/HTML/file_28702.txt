<span class="headword">Ward, Sir  Patience</span>  (1629&#150;1696), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born on 7 December 1629 at the manor of Tanshelf, near Pontefract, Yorkshire, the seventh son of Thomas Ward (<i>d</i>. 1635) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1651). Hoping for a daughter, Ward's puritan father had vowed to name his next child Patience, should he again be disappointed. After his father's death, Ward's mother intended him for the ministry. He was sent up to Cambridge in 1643, but he claimed to have found little edification there. He would instead find his vocation in commerce. He served an apprenticeship, beginning in 1646, to Launcelot Tolson, a London merchant who traded to France. In 1654&#150;5 he entered the French trade himself, becoming free of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and setting up a large establishment in the parish of St Laurence Pountney. He married Elizabeth Hobson (<i>d</i>. 1685) of Hackney on 8 June 1653. His wife's religious and political heritage matched his own puritan background, and his father-in-law, haberdasher William Hobson, was a leading London Independent and a supporter of the root and branch petition. Ward himself was both a reformed protestant with dissenting sympathies and an occasional conformist. (One of Ward's brothers, an Independent, was removed as a Pontefract alderman under the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span> of 1662.)<br>
<br>As a young merchant in the 1650s and 1660s Ward focused on business rather than politics, eventually becoming a major exporter of cloth to France. However, his future as a political opponent of Charles II was anticipated as early as 1664, when he was briefly imprisoned for a &#145;seditious&#146; petition about the customs. In 1670 he was elected alderman for the ward of Farringdon Within and was accepted by the full court of aldermen after first being rejected. He was also chosen, with a dissenting colleague, as sheriff of London and Middlesex for 1670&#150;71. These elections were intended by urban dissenters to block the local enforcement of the 1670 <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>. He was also chosen as master of the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1671.<br>
<br>Ward soon became a spokesman for London dissenters who desired liberty of conscience and for merchants with concerns about the growing commercial rivalry with France. His extensive connections to Huguenot traders reinforced his own reformed protestant perspectives: the threat from Louis XIV was, for him, also a threat to English protestantism. In 1673 he was among four aldermen who &#145;hung an asse&#146; and refused to act as stewards for a London Artillery Company feast in honour of the duke of York, a recent convert to Roman Catholicism. He also promoted a 1673 London petition to the crown about the city's trade, and he was one of the authors and signers of the anti-French <span class="italic">Scheme of the Trade as it is at Present Carried on between England and France</span> (1674). Although knighted by Charles in October 1675, he was by then associated with the urban opposition to the Anglican loyalist agenda of the earl of Danby. In 1678 his evidence before the committee of trade of the House of Lords contributed to the adoption of a three-year ban on many French imports. In September 1679 he was one of several London aldermen who refused to acknowledge the king's brother on a visit to Windsor. By 1680 his next-door neighbour was Dr Gilbert Burnet, who may also have been his friend.<br>
<br>Ward was deeply involved in the movement to exclude the duke of York from the succession during the three parliaments of 1679&#150;81. He was a member of each, serving for Pontefract. He was also elected lord mayor of London in September 1680. He marked that occasion with a speech recommending protestant accommodation or a &#145;Union in Affection of all those who profess the same Faith&#146;, published as <span class="italic">The Speech of &hellip; Sir Patience Warde &hellip; the Day of his Election</span> (1680)  (p. 3). Charles II indicated his displeasure with Ward's election by refusing to attend his mayoral installation. Several leading parliamentary advocates of exclusion did attend, however, and some Londoners celebrated his installation in the streets as a prelude to the anticipated recognition of the duke of Monmouth's claim to the throne. During Ward's mayoralty the strengthening alliance between parliamentary, county, and civic advocates of a protestant succession became known as the whigs. For their part, Anglican loyalists (or tories as they became known) charged that 1200 or 1300 dissenters were admitted to the London electorate during his mayoralty without taking the required oaths.<br>
<br>When the House of Commons adopted an exclusion bill on 11 November 1680 Ward immediately summoned a meeting of the London common council. The king regarded him as responsible for the ensuing unwelcome civic petition that he &#145;hearken and Incline to the Humble Advice&#146; of his parliament  (<span class="italic">To the Kings most Excellent Majesty</span>, 1680). Ward was also among the MPs who promoted an address to the crown for the removal of the London recorder, Sir George Jeffreys. He claimed that Jeffreys had sought to undercut an earlier London petition by falsely suggesting that &#145;Such Petitioning was bordering upon Treason, and the beginning of Rebellion&#146;  (A. Grey, <span class="italic">Debates of the House of Commons</span>, 10 vols., 1763, 7.463).<br>
<br>Ward's own commitment to the right of petitioning was further demonstrated when the London whigs reacted to Charles's prorogation of parliament on 10 January 1681. Amid mutterings that the MPs might resume their session in the city, Ward summoned another common council that requested Charles to recall parliament. Charles responded both by dissolving parliament and by warning Ward against meddling &#145;with those things that do not Concern you&#146;  (Library of Congress, London Newsletters, 7.148).<br>
<br>Ward's subsequent lengthy illness prevented him from taking any part in the events surrounding the third Exclusion Parliament. On 11 May 1681, however, he defied a royal order against summoning a common council, claiming that the &#145;terrors and amazements&#146; of the time made one necessary  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 269). When common council adopted another petition for a parliament, Ward and other leading civic whigs were deprived of their places on the London lieutenancy commission. His encouragement of the whig movement in the city hastened Charles's decision to intervene in the corporation on behalf of the tories. Ward's mayoralty was also notable for the decision taken, in part at his behest, to inscribe on the fire monument the famous attribution of the great fire of 1666 to a Catholic conspiracy. Shortly after his mayoralty he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Ward remained a critical whig player in the 1681&#150;3 political contest for the city. He also continued to advocate accommodation between the Church of England and the dissenters. He invited Burnet to preach in favour of protestant union at the election of his mayoral successor. He presented Charles with a petition against the persecution of protestants and, as a city magistrate, refused to act on several informations against conventicles. Angered by the government's efforts of 1681 to convict the earl of Shaftesbury and other whigs of treason, Ward was rumoured in December 1681 to be collecting depositions for the impeachment of the king's chief ministers, should another parliament be called. In January 1682 he was chosen in common council as a member of the committee to defend the London charter against the crown's <i>quo warranto</i>. In April 1682 he was one of the organizers of a whig banquet in honour of the duke of Monmouth that was objected to by the crown. He was frequently in the company of both Monmouth and Shaftesbury during the next months, and his home was an occasional meeting-place for the whig grandees. Indeed, Shaftesbury may have been at Ward's house as late as 17 October 1682, by which time the earl may have been plotting resistance to the regime.<br>
<br>Shortly after Shaftesbury's disappearance Ward offered evidence in the trial of his whig friend, Alderman Thomas Pilkington. Pilkington faced the charge of <i>scandalum magnatum</i>, at the suit of the duke of York, for allegedly suggesting in public that York had burnt London and intended death to its leading citizens. When Pilkington was convicted of the words, Ward was charged with perjury. His trial in May 1683 provided Sir George Jeffreys, who urged his conviction, with an opportunity for revenge. When found guilty Ward had already gone underground. He was discovered in June in the Barbican house of surgeon Charles Bateman, who was involved in whig resistance plans, but succeeded in fleeing to the Netherlands.<br>
<br>By this time Ward's unusual given name had become a byword in the tory prints for whig impatience and disloyalty. Indeed, Aphra Behn had employed his name and his fear of &#145;French papishes&#146; as early as 1678 in the first of her dramatic political satires. Nevertheless, the extent of Ward's knowledge about whig conspiracy in 1682&#150;3 is unclear. The circle of conspirators around Robert West actually marked him for punishment as a &#145;trimmer&#146; who had insufficiently advanced the whig cause during his mayoralty  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.420).<br>
<br>Exiled in the Netherlands for the next five years, Ward moved within various circles of English refugees and rebels, keeping his distance from some but consorting with others. Transferring part of his wealth abroad, he contributed &pound;500 to Monmouth's failed rebellion of 1685. He also associated with John Locke, Slingsby Bethel, Robert Ferguson, Thomas Papillon, Sir John Thompson, Lord Wharton, John Wildman, and Benjamin Furley, the Quaker merchant and book collector. He was a financial backer of the English cloth manufactory at Leeuwarden, the profits of which were intended to support resistance to the regime of James II. Sobered by the death of his wife in 1685, and surprised by James's turn towards toleration, he sought and received pardon for his political past in 1687.<br>
<br>Ward returned to civic and national prominence in the wake of the revolution of 1688. In London he resumed his aldermanic place, was added to the lieutenancy commission, assumed command of a militia regiment, and was elected one of the City MPs for the Convention. The new government also rewarded him with appointments to the customs commission, the commission for discouraging the export of wool, and the assessments commissions for London and the West Riding of Yorkshire. His activity in the Convention demonstrated his continuing commitments to electoral rights, to reformed protestantism in England and abroad, and to advancing English against French trade. In the city he supported a whig effort to release the electorate and the common council from most magisterial restraints. In the Convention he favoured an investigation of the royal intrusion upon civic rights after the Oxford parliament. He also favoured repealing the sacramental test for office-holding, a position that prompted tory talk about expelling him for nonconformity.<br>
<br>Although Ward promoted corporation loans to the new regime, he and William III were uneasy with one another by September 1689. When the king moved towards the tories in early 1690 Ward lost his militia colonelcy. Like the other whig City MPs in the Convention, he was defeated by the London church candidates who stood for the new parliament. Still an active merchant, he remained a commissioner for the customs and for the London lieutenancy. In 1694 he acquired &pound;4000 of the original stock of the Bank of England. A contributor to funds for the support of dissenting ministry, he also became a member of the largely nonconformist New England Company, which sponsored missionaries to Native Americans.<br>
<br>Ward died, childless, on 10 July 1696 at St Laurence Pountney and was buried in his parish church of St Mary Abchurch. Still committed to reformed protestantism within the Church of England, he left money to support impoverished Anglican clergy. Complaining of losses amounting to &pound;40,000, he left few other legacies but offered forgiveness to all those who had &#145;trespassed against and persecuted&#146; him in the late &#145;evil times&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/433/167). He had already advanced his London nephew, Sir John Ward (1650&#150;1726), who followed him in civic, parliamentary, and commercial affairs.<br>
