<span class="headword">King,  John Glen</span>  (1731/2&#150;1787), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Stowmarket, in Suffolk, the son of George King (<i>d</i>. 1756), rector of Nowton, Suffolk. Having attended a school at Swaffham he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 9 October 1747, at the age of fifteen; he graduated BA in 1752 and MA in 1763. He was ordained deacon at Norwich on 22 December 1754 and priest at Ely on 19 September 1756. In 1760 he was presented by the crown to the vicarage of Berwick Parva, Norfolk.<br>
<br>In July 1763 King was appointed chaplain to the English factory in St Petersburg. Though he was appointed medallist to Catherine II he failed to enter court circles and consequently left no impression of himself in Russia. This was due partly to the dislike conceived of him by Princess Dashkova, one of the most influential society ladies of the time, but primarily to his lack of social graces. King devoted much of his time to the study of the history and liturgical rites of the Orthodox church. He was encouraged to write a book about this by Sir George Macartney, English ambassador to the court of Catherine II, whom King met in St Petersburg in 1765. The first short version of King's book, entitled <span class="italic">The Present State of the Church of Russia</span>, appeared as an appendix to Macartney's own work on Russia in 1767. Between 1770 and 1772 King was in England, trying to publish his book on the Russian church and seeking a church preferment. On 10 January 1771 he was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and on 12 February he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was incorporated MA at Oxford on 19 March 1771, as a member of Christ Church, and on 23 March he took the Oxford degrees of BD and DD.<br>
<br>After the publication of his book <span class="italic">The Rites and Ceremonies of the Greek Church</span> in 1772 King's scholarly reputation was established; the work was highly acclaimed and became a standard text on the subject. However, he failed to find a position in England and had to return to the English factory in St Petersburg, where he spent some eleven years altogether, returning to England in the spring of 1774. He was living in Greenwich when he wrote his will on 2 November 1780, while leasing Tavistock Chapel, St Martin-in-the-Fields, from the duke of Bedford. In July 1783 he was presented to the rectory of Wormley, Hertfordshire, by Sir Abraham Hume, bt. In the summer of 1786 he purchased the chapelry of Spring Gardens, Charing Cross, London; he also purchased, though precisely when is unknown, Dr Warner's chapel in Long Acre. Apart from the two versions of <span class="italic">The Rites and Ceremonies of the Greek Church</span> his works include: <span class="italic">Verses</span>, in the Cambridge University collection on the death of Frederick, prince of Wales (1752); &#145;A letter to the bishop of Durham, containing some observations on the climate of Russia, and the northern countries, with a view of the flying Mountains at Zarsko Sello, near St Petersburg&#146;, written in 1778 and published in the <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span> (vol. 8, 1780); and <span class="italic">Nummi familiarum et imperatorum Romanorum</span>. This substantial catalogue of Roman coinage was probably published in 1787 and includes 102 plates without letterpress.<br>
<br>King was married, first, to Ann Magdalen (1743/4&#150;1767), daughter of Michael Combrune; she died in Russia, aged twenty-three, leaving King a seventeen-month-old baby, Anna Henrietta. King's second wife, whom he married on 1 August 1776, was Jane, daughter of John Hyde of Blackheath. She is said by Nichols to have died in August 1789 but she may still have been alive in June 1790.<br>
<br>King had few friends. He had hoped that George Macartney, whom he had known in Russia, would be his patron but their correspondence shows that Macartney was unwilling to continue the acquaintance. King's only known close friend was the musician and music historian Charles Burney, whose daughter Fanny regarded King as a ridiculous man and commented that he &#145;spouted Shakespeare, Pope and others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Diary</span>, 134), imitated Garrick, and that her father had observed that he could talk &#145;three hours upon any given subject, without saying any thing&#146;  (ibid., 154). His social popularity was probably also undermined by his financial advice to Elizabeth Allen, later the second wife of Charles Burney, whom King recommended to invest in the merchant banker William Gomm's timber concession in northern Russia; Gomm was declared bankrupt in 1767, after Mrs Allen had invested &pound;5000 in his enterprise. King's last years were devoted to archaeological and numismatic research. He died at his house on Edward Street, Berwick Street, Soho, after a few hours' illness, on 3 November 1787, and was buried on 7 November in Wormley churchyard.<br>
