<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clementi,  Muzio</span>  (1752&#150;1832), <span class="occ">composer, pianist, and teacher</span>, was born on 23 January 1752 in Damaso, Rome, the eldest of seven children of Nicolo Clementi (1720&#150;1789), a silversmith, and his wife, Magdalena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kaiser (<i>d</i>. 1785). He received the standard musical training of a church organist from various teachers in Rome, and became organist in his local church at thirteen. His playing attracted the attention of Peter Beckford (1740&#150;1811), cousin of the novelist William Beckford (1759&#150;1844), who in 1766 contracted with Clementi's father to &#145;buy&#146; his son's services for seven years, taking him back to his country estate in Dorset. Though isolated from the mainstream of musical life, Clementi laid important foundations for his future career as a musician and virtuoso, spending hours at the harpsichord and studying scores by older composers such as Handel, Domenico Scarlatti, J. S. Bach, and C. P. E. Bach. He dedicated his first set of six sonatas, op. 1, to Beckford.<br>
<br>Leaving Beckford's service in 1774, Clementi travelled to London. Although he published a set of bravura variations, <span class="italic">The Black Joke</span>, as &#145;M. C.&#146; in 1777, he made his reputation as a virtuoso with the publication of his op. 2 sonatas in 1779. Typically, this was a set of six sonatas, three to be accompanied by a violin or flute, and the remainder for piano solo. The second, which became well known as &#145;the celebrated octave lesson&#146;, epitomized the virtuosic style that became associated with Clementi. At this time the piano was still in its infancy and had not yet supplanted the harpsichord. As the piano developed, so did Clementi's style, and he gradually blended his bravura writing with a more expressive style, eminently suited to the piano.<br>
<br>Clementi went on the first of his continental travels in 1780, performing in Paris and in Vienna, where he took part in the famous &#145;competition&#146; against Mozart, who acknowledged but derided his virtuosity in a now famous letter to his father. Paradoxically, Clementi's sonatas opp. 7&#150;10, written at this time, mark a turning away from empty virtuosity and reveal more depth in his musical style. After returning to London he was noted by 1785 not just as a performer but also as a composer: his symphonies were performed in 1786 and 1787, but they could not stand comparison with those of his famous contemporary Haydn. He conducted his own symphonies until 1796, but made his last concert appearance as a pianist in 1790, after which he turned instead to teaching. This appeared to be a reasonably lucrative pursuit, and Clementi attracted good pupils, including J. B. Cramer, John Field, and Theresa Jansen. The 1790s were a period of prolific composition of solo and accompanied sonatas as well as sonatinas for younger players; the latter are still played and enjoyed. Clementi's pedagogical interests of this time are also reflected in his <span class="italic">Introduction to the Art of Piano Playing</span> (1801), which is as interesting for its selection of &#145;lessons&#146; by a variety of composers as it is as a guide to contemporary pianism.<br>
<br>Clementi was as much a businessman as a musician, being involved with music publishing and piano manufacture. In 1798 he took over the firm Longman and Broderip with a partner, James Longman, who left in 1801, when Clementi took over with several partners at 26 Cheapside; additional premises were acquired in 1806 at 195 Tottenham Court Road.<br>
<br>Clementi travelled extensively from 1802 to 1810, penetrating as far as eastern Europe and St Petersburg in order to sell his instruments and to court various composers for their compositions. Accompanying him was Field, whom he took first to Vienna in 1802, and then to St Petersburg, where Field remained. During this time Clementi attracted other pupils, notably Alexander Klengel and Ludwig Berger. Clementi's letters to his chief partner, Frederick William Collard, reveal an astute businessman who nevertheless seemed in constant need of money. Keenly conscious of competition from other London makers such as Broadwood and Tomkison, he bullied his way from dealer to dealer, venting his frustration at his partners' occasional mistakes by quoting Virgil&#151;&#145;let us not <i>renovare dolorem</i>&#146;  (Clementi to Collard, 17 Aug 1803)&#151;and generally adopting a hectoring tone. The letters reveal a keen, highly literate man, with a flair for languages and with a certain dry humour. It was probably due to Clementi's considerable acumen that the firm remained successful even after a disastrous fire in 1807.<br>
<br>Letters of this period reflect the frenetic pace of Clementi's life. While in Berlin on 18 September 1804 he married Caroline Lehmann, the eighteen-year-old daughter of a noted Berlin musician. The marriage ended tragically less than a year later when she died shortly after giving birth to a son, Carl. Clementi wrote of his &#145;fatal and irreparable loss &hellip; God alone can give me strength to bear it&#146;  (Clementi to Collard, 31 Aug 1805). Throwing himself into his business, he announced in a letter of April 1807 his conquest of &#145;that haughty Beauty, Beethoven&#146;, who agreed to let him publish several of his works, though the arrangement was bedevilled by communication problems between the composer and the firm. After returning to London in the summer of 1810, Clementi swiftly made amends for whatever mistakes had occurred, issuing first editions of ten works.<br>
<br>Clementi married Emma Gisborne (<i>bap</i>. 1785), a contemporary of his first wife, on 6 July 1811; they had four children. In 1813 he was invited to become a director of the newly formed Philharmonic Society, which offered a forum for the performance of his own symphonies. In December 1814 he was elected to the Swedish Royal Academy of Music. His public success in England prompted him to set off again for the continent, this time to promote his own symphonies in Paris and in Leipzig.<br>
<br>Clementi's most important work of this period, and indeed of his life, was the aptly named <span class="italic">Gradus ad Parnassum</span>. Far more than just a collection of exercises for the piano, the three-volume <span class="italic">Gradus</span> encompasses a variety of genres and styles of keyboard composition; it is a vast compendium of Clementi's works for the piano written over many years, and published between 1817 and 1826. It is a monument to a composer who was called &#145;the father of the pianoforte&#146;; though he was not the first composer to write for the piano, his contribution to its development was inestimable. Indefatigable to the end, he retired to Lichfield in 1830, and died in Evesham, possibly at Elm Lodge, on 10 March 1832. He was buried with full honours in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey on 29 March.<br>
