<span class="headword">Taylour,  Helen Frances <span class="st"> [Fay]</span></span>  (1904&#150;1983), <span class="occ">racing motorist and political activist</span>, was born at Oxmanton Hall, Birr, King's county (later co. Offaly), Ireland, on 5 April 1904, the daughter of Herbert Fetherstonhaugh Taylour (1868/9&#150;1952), a district inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary, and a former colonel in the British army, and his wife, Helen Allardice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Webb (1868/9&#150;1925), whose father was a surgeon general of the Royal Army Medical Corps. One of Helen Taylour's sisters became an active suffragette and was imprisoned in Holloway gaol, where Fay was taken to see her. Later Fay Taylour would also be imprisoned there.<br>
<br>Taylour was educated at Miss Fletcher's boarding school in Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, before moving, in 1919, to Alexandra College, Dublin. She left Alexandra College in 1922, having won the school's tennis trophy and a &pound;50 prize for housecraft. Her family had already moved to Burghfield Bridge Lodge, Berkshire, following the creation of the Irish Free State and the disbanding of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Although Fay Taylour had been able to drive since the age of twelve it was not until she moved to England that she learned to ride a motorcycle, using her school prize money to buy, in quick succession, a number of increasingly powerful motorcycles.<br>
<br>Taylour's first competitive motorcycle race was a women's event held by the North London Cycle Club in February 1927. She was unsuccessful, but this event marked the beginning of her motorcycle career. She rode in a number of events that spring, and her success in the Southern Scott scramble in March, when she won the Venus cup for ladies, and the Camberley meeting in May led her to be taken on by the AJS motorcycle firm as a works team rider. She soon won a succession of races in different classes&#151;grass track, cross country, hill climbs, and trials&#151;and demonstrated from the outset that she was &#145;a rider of consummate skill with a striking determination and a courageous spirit&#146;  (Belton, 27).<br>
<br>Within a few months of starting her racing career Taylour was making a living from prize money; she moved from AJS to the Rudge team, and turned to dirt track, or speedway, racing. Her first speedway competition was at the Crystal Palace track in June 1928. She quickly made a name for herself in the sport, riding a Douglas against men and, notably, against the other leading woman dirt racer, Eva Askquith, whom she beat at Cleveland Park Speedway in Middlesbrough on 4 September 1928. In 1929 Taylour went to Australia to race in what was seen as the home of speedway. She defeated many Australian stars, including the most famous of the day, &#145;Super&#146; Sig Schlam. She drew record crowds and took &pound;1500 in prize money in four months. She returned to Australia in the winter of 1929, racing there and in New Zealand until the following summer. But when she returned to Britain she found that women had been banned from speedway racing by the Auto-Cycle Union. Although Taylour continued to race in speedway in Europe the ban had effectively ended her speedway career, forcing a move to motor car racing.<br>
<br>In 1931 Taylour went to India, where she won her first major car race, beating the course record for the Calcutta to Ranchi event. She went on to race in a range of classes. In October 1931, driving a Talbot, she won the ladies' handicap at Brooklands at a speed of 98.37 m.p.h., and regularly competed there until 1938. In the 3600 mile round Italy race, in May 1934, she drove a 1500 cc Aston Martin along with J. W. Bezzant. The same year she won the first Leinster trophy cup, the only woman driver in a field of twenty-nine. In 1939 she raced in the South African grand prix, but mechanical failure forced her out of the race. From South Africa she went to Germany, where she hoped to get a chance to drive the latest German cars, but frustrated in this she returned to England.<br>
<br>Taylour returned to England on 26 August 1939, a week before Britain's entry into the Second World War. Exactly two months later <span class="italic">Action</span>, the newspaper of the British Union of Fascists, announced: &#145;Miss Fay Taylour, the famous woman racing car driver, has just joined the British Union, and has placed her services at the disposal of the Peace Campaign&#146;  (<span class="italic">Action</span>, 26 Oct 1939). She was active in the British Union's anti-war campaign, but she was also involved with other anti-war and pro-Nazi groups. She was one of a number of largely women members of the Right Club who remained active despite the formal disbanding of the group by its founder, Captain Maule Ramsay MP. This activism led to her internment on 1 June 1940, and she was held, without charge or trial, until October 1943, first at Holloway gaol, then on the Isle of Man.<br>
<br>Following the war Taylour moved between the United Kingdom and Ireland, and was involved in the re-emergence of Mosleyite politics in London. But in 1949 she emigrated to the United States, where she sold British sports cars in Hollywood. She also returned to motor sport, racing midget cars on dirt tracks, racing in the USA, Europe, and Britain. In 1952 she travelled from the USA to her father's funeral in England, having been assured that there would be no visa problems on her return to the USA. However, she was refused re-entry into the USA as a security risk. This was a major blow to Taylour as it cut short her new racing career in America, although she was finally permitted re-entry in 1955. She continued to race throughout the 1950s, but by the end of the decade had retired. She continued to move around in her retirement, living for a year in South Africa. In August 1975 she moved to Winterborne Tomson, Dorset, where she lived in straitened circumstances, suffering from arthritis in her spine and hips. It was not until March 1976 that the British security services closed the file on her. She died, unmarried, at the Dorset County Hospital, Dorchester, on 2 August 1983.<br>
