<span class="headword">Berry,  (James) Gomer</span>, first Viscount Kemsley  (1883&#150;1968), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, was born on 7 May 1883 at 11 Church Street, Merthyr Tudful, the youngest of the three sons (all of whom became newspaper proprietors) of John Mathias Berry (<i>d</i>. 1917), an estate agent and Liberal alderman, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1922), the daughter of Thomas Rowe, of Pembroke Dock. Berry followed in the footsteps of the second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30733/', "William Ewert Berry, first Viscount Camrose (1879&#150;1954)")</script>, and left school at fourteen to work on the <span class="italic">Merthyr Tydfil Times</span>. Eager to learn his trade, William worked for several south Wales newspapers, before moving on to London, where he launched a paper of his own, <span class="italic">Advertising World</span>. His only capital was &pound;100 lent by his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46626/', "(Henry) Seymour Berry, Baron Buckland (1877&#150;1928)")</script>, whose business partner he became in 1902.<br>
<br>Ambitious and able, William Berry identified sport and leisure as an untapped and potentially lucrative field of magazine publishing. From the outset he planned for take-over and expansion. Gomer, on the other hand, was expected to fulfil the very specific tasks of promoting sales and selling advertising space. Nevertheless, the Berry enterprise proved remarkably successful, with sibling rivalry subsumed in a potent mixture of energy, entrepreneurialism, and&#151;particularly in the case of the junior partner&#151;honest endeavour.<br>
<br>In 1905 William and Gomer Berry sold <span class="italic">Advertising World</span> at an excellent profit. They bought a publishing house and started sundry periodicals, notably (in 1909) <span class="italic">Boxing</span>, of which sport William was a devotee. Their interests widened rapidly but they were discerning in their acquisitions. In 1907 Gomer Berry married Mary Lilian (<i>d</i>. 1928), daughter of Horace George Holmers of Brondesbury Park, London. They had one daughter and six sons: one son died young, and another was killed in action in 1944.<br>
<br>For well over three decades the Berry brothers pursued a common strategy, moving from specialist magazines back into the familiar world of the provincial press. High profit margins facilitated diversification, particularly after the First World War when their company invested in the fledgeling film industry as well as in more reliable revenue earners such as Kelly's directories. Large reserves of surplus capital also funded an early excursion into Fleet Street, with the wartime purchase in 1915 of a struggling <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, whose fortunes were swiftly restored through shrewd editorial direction and long overdue investment. In 1919 their purchase of the St Clement's Press brought control of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, and with it a high City profile.<br>
<br>The year 1924 saw the foundation of Allied Newspapers (later Kemsley Newspapers), controlled by the Berry brothers and Sir E. M. Iliffe. The purpose of this group was to take over most of the Hulton papers from Lord Rothermere. These included the <span class="italic">Daily Dispatch</span>, the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening Chronicle</span>, and the <span class="italic">Sunday Chronicle</span>. During the years up to 1928 Allied Newspapers further acquired papers in Glasgow, Sheffield, Newcastle, Middlesbrough, and Aberdeen. They also bought the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> and <span class="italic">Illustrated Sunday Herald</span> from Rothermere's Daily Mail Trust. In Cardiff, where they already held the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> and the <span class="italic">Evening Express</span>, they acquired the <span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span> and the <span class="italic">South Wales Echo</span>, merging the two morning and the two evening papers.<br>
<br>Newspapers apart, the group's biggest purchase was made in 1926: the Amalgamated Press from the executors of Lord Northcliffe. This great concern comprised a large number of non-political periodicals, ranging from the <span class="italic">Woman's Journal</span> to children's comic sheets. It included a powerful encyclopaedia and book section, which had been built up under Northcliffe's aegis, chiefly by John Hammerton and Arthur Mee. There were also printing works at Blackfriars and Gravesend and the Imperial Paper Mills, also at Gravesend. In 1927 paper supplies were further augmented by the acquisition of Edward Lloyd Ltd, one of the largest mills in the world.<br>
<br>The key acquisition&#151;of a first-rate serious London daily newspaper&#151;came in 1927 when the Berry&#150;Iliffe group purchased the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. William Berry assumed editorial control with a clear agenda for modernization and major sales growth, and within a decade circulation had risen sevenfold. Other less prominent national titles were accumulated throughout the inter-war period, but predominance at regional and local level remained a central tenet of company policy, and the firm held an almost monopolistic position across large swathes of the provincial press, particularly in south Wales. Nationally, Allied Newspapers and its subsidiary companies owned the best-selling quality daily and Sunday newspapers, and dominated the magazine market.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly, the triumvirate at the heart of this huge media conglomerate were all ennobled, their loyalty dutifully acknowledged by a grateful Conservative premier. Stanley Baldwin recommended Gomer Berry for a baronetcy in 1928, and in 1936 facilitated his elevation to the peerage. Lord Kemsley, as he was now known, shared his brother William's unequivocal belief in Baldwin's ability, effortlessly transferring his affections to Neville Chamberlain when the latter entered Downing Street in May 1937. Indeed Kemsley kept faith with the new prime minister's policy of appeasing the axis powers long after his brother (since 1929 Lord Camrose) had steered the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> towards an editorial position little short of hostile. Kemsley in contrast encouraged close contact with the German press, and as late as 27 July 1939 paid a fruitless visit to Hitler at Bayreuth. Such a blinkered approach to great-power relations rarely generated any serious tension between the two brothers, if only because Allied Newspapers had been dissolved in 1937. The families of Camrose, Kemsley, and Iliffe each expected to inherit a recognized raft of financial holdings: hence the decision to divide up the company.<br>
<br>Although ownership of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> kept Camrose in the limelight, after 1937 Kemsley stepped out of his brother's shadow. He became chairman of Allied Newspapers, renamed Kemsley Newspapers six years later. Although much diminished, this was still the largest newspaper empire in Britain, boasting no fewer than six morning, seven evening, six weekly, and four Sunday titles nationwide. These included some of the provincial press's most popular&#151;and sometimes most notorious&#151;newspapers, notably the <span class="italic">Daily Record</span> in Glasgow and the <span class="italic">Daily Dispatch</span> in Manchester. In Fleet Street Kemsley owned the equally downmarket <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, and also the <span class="italic">Sunday Graphic</span>. However, the jewel in the crown, and the newspaper he remains most closely associated with, was the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. True to character, he would have left the paper in the hands of his brother had there not been a last-minute intervention by his second wife. Lady Kemsley recognized that, although the once moribund <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> was by 1937 outselling <span class="italic">The Observer</span> by nearly 70,000 copies a week, a burgeoning middle-class market still remained largely untapped. Such insight reaped a rich reward, both in sales and in advertising revenue: circulation was then already 263,000, but over the next two decades it quadrupled.<br>
<br>Though he was short on vision, and bereft of political nous, Kemsley had a real strength in his financial ability. His brother had for over twenty years been editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>: hence the new owner's insistence on adopting a similar hands-on approach. So acquiescent editors often found themselves awaiting lengthy and ponderous leaders, dispatched from the penthouse office in the renamed Kemsley House (a further insight into the nature of the man is his insistence in 1937 that henceforth every title block should include the words &#145;a Kemsley newspaper&#146;).<br>
<br>Although they were very different newspapers, both the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> embodied the complacent conservatism and Victorian certitudes of their proprietor. Kemsley was genuinely shocked by Chamberlain's fall from grace in May 1940, adjusting only slowly to a very different political climate and a very different party leader. After all, only ten months had passed since he had blithely reassured the F&uuml;hrer that Churchill could no longer be taken seriously; and yet, once Kemsley had made the appropriate psychological adjustment, all his newspapers became ardently pro-Winston, as could be seen in the excessive partisanship of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> throughout the 1945 election campaign. Three years earlier the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> not only upheld the prime minister's right to shut down the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> should he so wish (as was threatened, after its publication of the notorious cartoon by Philip Zec), but even went so far as to congratulate Churchill on his opposition to the Beveridge report. Every evening at dinner Kemsley scrutinized the <span class="italic">Sketch</span>'s galley proofs, his blue pencil poised to censor even the slightest hint of criticism or dissent. A defeated and despondent Churchill insisted in October 1945 that there was now only one press baron he could still depend upon. Kemsley's reward had been a viscountcy in the 1945 resignation honours list.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> was relaunched as the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span> in 1946, but its editorial policy remained staunchly anti-Labour. The paper's idiosyncratic view of the world reflected the prevailing preoccupations of its proprietor, a state of affairs that survived until the second Lord Rothermere purchased the title in 1952 and restored its former name. Throughout Labour's period in office Kemsley clashed repeatedly with both back-benchers and ministers. The early post-war years were marked by acrimony and litigation, with Kemsley Newspapers fighting a number of libel actions: in August 1946 the attorney-general, Sir Hartley Shawcross, was forced to apologize for using the phrase &#145;the gutter press&#146;. Kemsley's deep antipathy towards Labour was a key factor in the setting up of the 1947&#150;9 royal commission on the press; and when giving evidence he was perhaps less than frank about the level of proprietorial interference in editorial policy.<br>
<br>By the early 1950s the lifting of wartime restrictions had left the newspaper industry facing a harsher, more competitive climate. As the decade progressed, Kemsley's stifling formality and relentlessly autocratic style of management appeared increasingly outmoded. The stiff manner and equally stiff collars, the bespoke suits and silk ties, the private lift to the top floor, the chauffeured limousine, and the white-gloved flunkeys all signalled a creaking, old-fashioned newspaper operation. Kemsley's sons, three of whom worked on the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, enjoyed the same privileges as their father. Nevertheless, circulation remained buoyant in the mid-1950s, despite fierce competition from a revitalized <span class="italic">Observer</span>. The Suez crisis late in 1956 marked a dramatic clash between the two newspapers, with David Astor wholly opposed to intervention and Lord Kemsley stoutly defending Anthony Eden's conduct throughout the whole sorry affair.<br>
<br>With hindsight, it is clear that Kemsley made a crucial strategic error in 1955 by withdrawing from the consortium awarded the first ITA franchise for weekend television in the midlands and the north. The later 1950s also saw the gradual break-up of Kemsley Newspapers, culminating in the sale of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> in August 1959. Initially Kemsley envisaged selling off all his holdings other than his flagship paper, but he was advised that any serious bidder would insist on the inclusion of the principal revenue earner. The family's extravagant lifestyle and heavy tax bills, together with the prospect of crippling death duties, necessitated the sale of their remaining 40 per cent stake in the company. In the aftermath of a costly strike, and with his bloated enterprise clearly ripe for take-over, Kemsley was determined to get out while he could still demand a high price for his ordinary shares. A discreet approach to the Canadian newspaper and television proprietor Roy H. Thomson (later Lord Thomson of Fleet) culminated in the whole portfolio being offloaded for &pound;5 million. Thomson had to borrow &pound;3 million in the city in order to complete the deal. With piquant irony it was the substantial profits from his commercial television franchise in Scotland that guaranteed his creditworthiness.<br>
<br>Kemsley left 200 Gray's Inn Road with scarcely a backward glance. He sold his large London home, Chandos House, but retained Dropmore, an impressive country estate in Buckinghamshire. Here he lived with his second wife, Edith (<i>d</i>. 1976), the daughter of E. N. Merandon Du Plessis, of Constance, Flacq, Mauritius, whom he had married in 1931. Divorced from a Dutch diplomat, Cornelius Dresselhuys, and an impressive figure in her own right, the flamboyant and formidable Lady Kemsley was appointed OBE in 1953, later becoming a commander of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. She suffered from severe ill health for several years, but outlived her husband. Kemsley died in Monte Carlo on 6 February 1968. His eldest son, (Geoffrey) Lionel (1909&#150;1999), became the second viscount.<br>
<br>Kemsley's only daughter, <a name="cosubject_69392"></a><span class="headword">(Mary) Pamela Gordon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Berry]</span></span>, marchioness of Huntly  (1918&#150;1998), the twin of Oswald, Kemsley's fifth son, was born on 13 June 1918 at Granville, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. She grew up at Kemsley's Buckinghamshire house, Farnham Royal, and was educated at North Foreland Lodge School, North Foreland, Kent. On 15 March 1941 she married Douglas Charles Lindsey Gordon, twelfth marquess of Huntly (1908&#150;1987), premier marquess of Scotland: they had one son and one daughter. Huntly had inherited the title in 1937 from his great-uncle, the spendthrift eleventh marquess, who in 1922 sold the estate of Aboyne Castle, Aberdeenshire. Pamela's Kemsley wealth largely restored the Huntly family fortunes, enabling her husband to buy back the ruined castle and 900 acres. During the Second World War she drove ambulances in Aberdeen, and she was later active in charity work in the city. Encouraged by her father, from 1940 to 1959 she was a director of Aberdeen Journals, a Kemsley subsidiary. She also wrote a weekly column under the name of Mary Meldrum (a Huntly title). A motor-car enthusiast, she owned various unusual models; she also qualified as a pilot. She played bridge to international standard and represented Britain at canasta. Her marriage ended in divorce in 1965, and Huntly remarried in 1977. Their son, Granville Charles Gomer Gordon (<i>b</i>. 1944), became the thirteenth marquess. She died on 29 January 1998.<br>
