<span class="headword">Farmer,  Anthony</span>  (<em>b. </em>1657), <span class="occ">college head designate</span>, was born in autumn 1657, the son of John Farmer of Frolesworth, Leicestershire. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, on 14 August 1672, became pensioner there on 3 July 1673, and a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, on 21 April 1676. He proceeded BA in 1676/7, and was incorporated MA on 13 July 1680. For a few months he taught, unpaid, at Chippenham under his relation Benjamin Flower, an unlicensed ejected clergyman.<br>
<br>Farmer received a testimonial from Trinity on 20 December 1681 for the diaconate; on 1 September 1683 he entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and thence Magdalen College on 13 July 1685. He was admitted to the newly founded Philosophical Society on 28 October 1684 but his academic career was undistinguished and he published nothing. He received conventional testimonials of sobriety and Anglican conformity, signed by the same fellows who were later to accuse him of debauchery and perversion, on applying unsuccessfully for a living (on 9 November 1685) and for a fellowship of All Souls (on 23 October 1686).<br>
<br>The turning point of Farmer's career was Monmouth's rebellion in summer 1685, when he volunteered for the king, presumably serving under Francis Bagshaw in the Magdalen company. This eagerness for the king's cause must have drawn attention to Farmer at court, for when the presidency of Magdalen came vacant he was nominated by James II in his mandate of 5 April 1687. The fellows resented this infringement of their right of election, and petitioned immediately against the nomination, stating that Farmer was ineligible by statute, never having been a college fellow. This petition was given to Lord Sunderland by Thomas Smith and Bagshaw on 10 April; four days later they were told curtly &#145;The King expects to be obeyed&#146;  (Bloxam, 22). Sunderland had probably neglected to show the petition to the king, a neglect which brought down both dynasty and constitution. On 15 April the fellows elected John Hough as president; the king's surprise at this move was conveyed on 21 April and the college replied, still with nothing against Farmer except the statutory disqualification. Only on 7 May did they begin to frame the astonishing catalogue of moral delinquencies which have blackened Farmer ever since. By late June these accusations were formalized into a charge before the commissioners sent to inquire into the affair. Farmer apparently waived his claim to the presidency  (Magdalen College, MS 249, 89) but drew up a convincing defence of his reputation  (ibid., 78&#150;88). This failed, and the lord chancellor concluded on 29 July, telling Farmer &#145;The court looked upon him as a very bad man&#146;  (Bloxam, 79). Farmer, who was certainly not a Catholic, and if anything was more sympathetic to presbyterianism, disappeared without trace, his place in history due to the machinations of others, not his own. His last appearance is in a note of 9 August 1687 in the college inventory that he dutifully returned some silver he had borrowed  (Brockliss, Harris, and MacIntyre, 50).<br>
