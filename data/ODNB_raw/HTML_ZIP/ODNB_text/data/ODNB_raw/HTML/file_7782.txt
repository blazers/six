<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dollond family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1750&#150;1871), <span class="occ">makers of optical and scientific instruments</span>, were established in London by <a name="cosubject_7783"></a><span class="headword">John Dollond</span>  (1707&#150;1761)<span class="occ"></span>, originally a silk weaver. He was born in Spitalfields, London, the third child and eldest son of Jean Dollond, a Huguenot weaver, and his wife, Susanne Marie, who had both fled from France after the revocation of the edict of Nantes. His first biographer, the Revd Dr John Kelly, husband of his granddaughter Louisa, erred in giving his date of birth as 10 June 1706  (Kelly, 6), for his year of birth is entered in a family <span class="roman">Bible</span> as 1707. He was baptized at the French church in Threadneedle Street, in the City of London, on 24 June 1707.<br>
<br>Very little is known of John Dollond's early life and education, except that he was brought up as a silk weaver, like his father. He had to work to help support the family from an early age, but even as a teenager he pursued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, and he became a member of the Spitalfields Mathematical Society. On 25 February 1727 he married Elizabeth Sommelier (1708&#150;1782); of their nine children, only two sons and three daughters survived to adulthood. John continued to pursue his studies, developing a particular interest in astronomy and optics. This enthusiasm was passed on to his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_7784"></a><span class="headword">Peter Dollond</span>  (1731&#150;1820)<span class="occ"></span>, his second child, born on 13 February 1731. It was through his son that John Dollond gave up weaving and became an optician.<br>
<br>Peter Dollond was trained as a silk weaver and assisted in the family business, but he did not take to the work and in 1750 set up as an optician, under his father's guidance. His first shop was probably in Vine Court, Spitalfields, where the Dollond family lived. By 1752 the optician's business was sufficiently successful for John Dollond to abandon weaving and go into partnership with his son. During 1753 they moved house to Denmark Court, Westminster, and by 1759 had opened a shop &#145;at the Golden Spectacles and Sea quadrant, Near Exeter Exchange in the Strand&#146;. Here they traded as J. Dollond &amp; Son, witness the signatures on an early achromatic telescope at the Royal Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, and a compound microscope at the Whipple Museum, Cambridge.<h2>
<a name="JohnDollondsimprovementoftelescopes"></a>John Dollond's improvement of telescopes</h2>John Dollond immediately began to improve refracting telescopes, having the reports of his work communicated to the Royal Society by his friend the optician James Short, who was a fellow. There was little competition between the two because Short made only reflecting telescopes. John Dollond's first letter, read to the society on 1 March 1753, &#145;concerning an Improvement of refracting Telescopes&#146;, described a method of correcting eyeglasses. This was followed by his first public contribution to the theory of optics, &#145;A mistake in Euler's theorem for correcting aberration in object-glasses for refracting telescopes&#146; (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1753, 287). This was inspired by a paper by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, which had been published by the Berlin Academy in 1749 and summarized in a letter from Euler which Short communicated to the Royal Society in November 1752. A description of a further practical improvement devised by Dollond followed in May 1753, an adaptation of the micrometer invented by Servington Savery. Instead of Savery's two separate glasses, Dollond used a single glass cut in half, with the two parts sliding against each other. He developed three versions of this device, which became known as the divided object-glass micrometer, the first of which found some use for measuring the apparent diameter of heavenly bodies, although it halved the brightness of the image. The second and third versions were less successful.<br>
<br>John Dollond was at the same time working on the improvement of objective lenses for refracting telescopes. His criticism of Euler in 1753 had been based on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of optics. Euler addressed the problem of chromatic aberration which resulted in coloured fringes of light distorting the images seen through refracting telescopes. He suggested that it could be removed by having two lenses with water between them, taking the human eye as his inspiration. Dollond criticized this proposal because Newton's laws, which had been verified by experiment, showed that chromatic aberration in glass lenses could not be corrected.<br>
<br>However, Dollond was soon led to question his previous confidence in Newton's experiments by the work of Samuel Klingenstierna, professor of mathematics and later physics at Uppsala University in Sweden. After seeing Euler's article Klingenstierna began to investigate Newton's experiments mathematically, discovering inconsistencies which led him to conclude that the experiments could not all be correct and that the general laws deduced from them were not valid. When he heard of Dollond's criticism of Euler, Klingenstierna translated his own paper into Latin and asked a pupil who was in London to show it to Dollond. It led Dollond to doubt his previous confidence in Newton's theories and to begin repeating some of the latter's experiments with prisms. Eventually he was able to produce a compound lens for refracting telescopes which was free of both chromatic and spherical aberration. In April 1758, prompted by his son, Dollond obtained a patent for his new lenses and in June he communicated the results of his experiments to the Royal Society as &#145;An account of some experiments concerning the different refrangibility of light&#146; (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1757&#150;8, 733&#150;43), although he did not mention what had inspired him to undertake the work. The lenses were described as achromatic, a term said to have been coined by Dr John Bevis.<h2>
<a name="Theachromaticlens"></a>The achromatic lens</h2>Ever since Dollond's own time it has been debated whether he was entitled to claim the invention of the achromatic telescope lens, or whether he merely took up ideas previously developed by Chester Moor Hall (<i>bap</i>. 1703, <i>d</i>. 1771) and the European mathematicians. Chester Moor Hall was a barrister and landed gentleman with an interest in optics. It was claimed by another eminent optician, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23105/', "Jesse Ramsden")</script>, who was married to John Dollond's daughter Sarah (1743&#150;1796), in a paper read to the Royal Society (letters and papers, decade IX, no. 146), that as far back as the 1730s Hall had developed an achromatic object-glass made from a combination of two lenses of different types of glass with different refractive powers. The optician employed to grind these lenses later mentioned the fact to Dollond, information which, combined with the ideas of Klingenstierna and his own experiments, enabled Dollond to develop his achromatic compound lens. Like Hall's, it made use of the different refractive powers of crown and flint, or lead, glass. Although the idea of using two types of glass with different refracting properties came first from Hall, neither he nor the opticians who worked with him were able to develop a method of producing achromatic lenses in commercial quantities. Dollond's contribution was first to devise a much quicker and simpler method of correcting the spherical aberration of the lenses. Second, he realized that batches of glass varied in their refractive and dispersive powers, and developed a method of measuring these values so that batches could be matched and achromatic doublet lenses reliably produced. It was the difficulty of correcting spherical aberration and of producing good-quality achromatic lenses in quantity which had inhibited the other opticians who knew of Hall's experiments from effectively exploiting their knowledge. Dollond was able to solve these problems and bring the achromatic lens successfully to the market.<br>
<br>In 1758 John Dollond was awarded the Copley medal of the Royal Society for his work on achromatic lenses, and on 28 May 1761 he was elected a fellow. In addition to these honours, in December 1760 he was appointed as optician to the king, George III. However, there was some resentment among the European mathematicians, who felt that their contributions to the advances in the understanding of optics and the improvement of lenses had not been properly acknowledged by Dollond and the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Late in the evening of 29 November 1761 John Dollond suffered what contemporaries described as an attack of apoplexy, probably a stroke, and died soon afterwards; contemporary notices record the date of his death as 29 November; Kelly  (Kelly, 13) gives it as 30 November. It was said that he had been sitting by the fire at his house in the Strand studying Clairaut's treatise on the motions of the moon when he was taken ill. He was buried on 6 December at the parish church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, a short distance from his shop. Kelly provides the only character sketch of John Dollond:<blockquote>In his appearance he was grave, and the strong lines of his face were marked with deep thought and reflection; but in his intercourse with his family and friends he was cheerful and affectionate; and his language and sentiments are distinctly remembered as always making a strong impression on the minds of those with whom he conversed. His memory was extraordinarily retentive, and amidst the variety of his reading he could recollect and quote the most important passages of every book which he had at any time perused. (Kelly, 14)</blockquote>Dollond regularly attended services at the French protestant church in Threadneedle Street.<h2>
<a name="Patentdisputes"></a>Patent disputes</h2>John Dollond had financed the cost of applying for the achromatic lens patent by means of a partnership agreement with fellow optician, Francis Watkins (<i>bap</i>. 1723, <i>d</i>. 1792), dated 29 May 1758. Watkins paid the expenses of the application in return for an equal share in the profits arising from the exploitation of the patent. The cost of making the tube and glass were to be deducted, then a quarter of the profit was to be retained by the seller, the remaining three-quarters divided equally. Peter Dollond inherited his father's share of the profits from the patent, and acquired the whole rights in 1763 for &pound;200, terminating the previous arrangement on the grounds that Watkins had on occasion retained the entire profit, contrary to the articles of partnership.<br>
<br>On 16 August 1761, a few months before his father's death, Peter Dollond married Ann Phillips at St Martin-in-the-Fields. Between 1760 and 1767 they had two daughters, Louisa and Ann, followed by a son, John, who probably died young. After his first wife's death Peter married a Mrs Randall in 1795. Peter Dollond took an active part in London guild affairs, becoming a freeman of the Spectaclemakers' Company in March 1755 and master in 1774&#150;82, 1797&#150;9, and 1801&#150;3. However, he did not become a freeman of the City until 1765, shortly before taking his first apprentice, John Berge, in December of that year. He took three more apprentices between 1769 and 1778, including his nephew John Huggins, son of his sister Susan, who had married William Huggins. He also apparently received some assistance in the business from his sister Sarah, who became estranged from her husband, Jesse Ramsden, and with their son John occupied a house in Haymarket owned by the Dollonds.<br>
<br>Peter Dollond was a far more ruthless businessman than his father, and set about exploiting the achromatic lens patent to the full. Towards the end of 1763 he took proceedings in the court of king's bench against Watkins for infringing the patent. In June 1764 he extracted from Martha Ayscough, widow of the optician James Ayscough, a bond of &pound;500 that she would not make achromatic refracting telescopes. These actions brought Peter Dollond into conflict with many of the other London opticians. Thirty-five of them signed a petition to the privy council calling for John Dollond's patent of 1758 to be revoked, on the grounds that the achromatic lens had been invented by Chester Moor Hall and was already on sale in London before 1758. Their action was supported by the court of the Spectaclemakers' Company, whose master at that time was Watkins, the Dollonds' former partner. The company contributed &pound;20 towards the expenses of presenting the petition, but to no avail as the privy council refused to hear it. It was left to those who were prosecuted by Peter Dollond for infringing his father's patent to defend themselves in the courts. In a series of cases between 1764 and 1768 Peter Dollond established his right to enjoy the privileges of the patent, and in so doing created a precedent in the case law on patents which was referred to in later judgments. Hearing Dollond's case against the optician James Champneys in the court of common pleas, Lord Mansfield gave his decision in favour of the patentee on the grounds that it was &#145;not the person who locked up his invention in his scrutoire that ought to profit by such an invention, but he who brought it forth for the benefit of the public&#146;  (TNA: PRO, court of common pleas, judgments, H.6 Geo III, 626 Middx, Feb 1766).<h2>
<a name="Partnershipandcommercialsuccess"></a>Partnership and commercial success</h2>In 1766 Peter Dollond went into partnership with his younger brother, John (1746&#150;1804), and also moved to a new shop, acquiring for &pound;200 the lease on premises in St Paul's Churchyard, later no. 59, from Mary Sterrop, widow of the optician Thomas Sterrop. The firm traded as P. and J. Dollond, supplying a wide range of mathematical, philosophical, and optical instruments, including several items for Captain James Cook's second voyage of exploration to the Pacific. Peter continued to improve the achromatic telescope objective, perfecting the combination of three lenses with which his father had begun to experiment. This further development of his father's work was communicated to the Royal Society on 7 February 1765. The new arrangement reduced the spherical error of the lens, and was generally accepted as a significant improvement. The Dollonds were the first to use mahogany telescope tubes, which were much more robust than the traditional vellum, and in 1783 they began to supply instruments with plated brass draw tubes, made by a process patented in 1782 by Joshua L. Martin. Peter Dollond was also working to improve other instruments. In 1772 he sent the Royal Society a description of adjustments to the glasses of Hadley's quadrant, which helped to prevent distortion, and he also patented the arrangement. In 1779 his &#145;Account of an apparatus applied to the equatorial instrument for correcting the errors arising from refraction in altitude&#146; was presented to the Royal Society by the astronomer royal, Nevil Maskelyne. However, neither of the younger Dollonds was elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society. Indeed, the French astronomer, Jean Bernoulli, who visited the Dollonds during his stay in England, professed astonishment at Peter Dollond's lack of mathematical understanding, although he admitted later that he might have drawn too sweeping a conclusion from a limited conversation, and certainly Peter had sufficient knowledge to develop the use of devices for measuring the properties of lenses.<br>
<br>The telescopes supplied by Peter Dollond were much in demand. For the Royal Observatory at Greenwich he made an achromatic telescope of 10 ft focus with a double object-glass of 5 ins. diameter, the largest and only one of that size he made. In fact, in the closing years of the eighteenth century his workshop supplied all the new refracting lenses and eyepieces for the observatory. Dollond's refractors were also sought by customers overseas, who included J. J. Lalande, head of the Paris observatory, and Charles Messier, another Frenchman, who was responsible for the first major catalogue of nebulae. However, there were frequent complaints about the time taken to complete orders, and the high cost of Dollond telescopes. In part the delays were beyond the Dollonds' control, because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient good-quality optical glass, especially for the larger lenses. Peter justified the cost by the care and time needed to produce high-quality achromatic refractors. Certainly Dollond instruments enjoyed a high reputation in the British Isles, to the extent that &#145;a Dollond&#146; became a synonym for a telescope, but it was widely believed by contemporaries that refractors made in the latter part of Peter Dollond's lifetime by the Swiss optician Pierre Louis Guinand were superior, because Guinand developed his own process of producing improved optical glass with far fewer imperfections than the traditional methods.<h2>
<a name="Furtherfamilyinvolvement"></a>Further family involvement</h2>In November 1805, the year after his brother John's death, Peter Dollond took into partnership his nephew George Huggins, who changed his name by licence to Dollond, the alteration being recorded by the College of Arms. However, the trading name remained P. and J. Dollond. <a name="cosubject_7782"></a><span class="headword">George Dollond</span>  (1774&#150;1852)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 25 January 1774, the sixth son and seventh and youngest child of Susan 
    (or Susanne; 1728&#150;1798)
  , daughter of John Dollond, and William Huggins. He was educated at George Lloyd's seminary in Kennington, Surrey. His father died while he was still a child and his uncle, Peter Dollond, arranged his training. In March 1788 he was apprenticed in the London Grocers' Company to Charles Fairbone, mathematical instrument maker, but he did not take his freedom until June 1804. In 1807 he also took his freedom by purchase in his uncle's guild, the Spectaclemakers' Company; he served as its master between 1811 and 1813.<br>
<br>The family tradition of inventiveness continued with George Dollond, who patented a new lighting arrangement for compass binnacles in 1812. He developed an improved micrometer with a rock crystal eyepiece, which he explained to the Royal Society in 1821. He had extensive business with a variety of public institutions, supplying equipment for the observatories at Cambridge, Madras, and Trivandrum. He provided the board of longitude with some of the instruments used on the Arctic expedition of 1821, and a Dollond theodolite was used by Captain Lort Stokes in his surveys of Australia, New Zealand, and the Timor Sea. However, not everyone was satisfied with the goods supplied by Dollond. Lord Palmerston, for example, sent back a telescope, complaining of the indistinctness of the image.<br>
<br>Peter Dollond apparently retired from business in 1819 and George carried on the family firm alone, though in 1820 Peter and George were jointly made opticians to George IV. Peter Dollond moved his home to Richmond in 1817, but three years later moved back to Kennington, where after only a few days he died, on 2 July 1820; he was buried at the parish church of St Mary, Lambeth.<br>
<br>George Dollond was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1819. Like his grandfather and uncle, he had papers published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. He played an active role in seeking a charter for the creation of the Astronomical Society and became one of the founding fellows in 1820. He was also a founder member of the Royal Geographical Society in 1830. On the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 he was appointed optician to her majesty. He contributed a number of papers to the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society</span>, notably &#145;A short account of a new instrument for measuring vertical and horizontal angles&#146; (vol. 2, 1826, 125), describing improvements to enhance the accuracy of such devices. He wrote a number of short treatises on some of the instruments he sold, such as <span class="italic">Description of the Camera Lucida</span> (<i>c</i>.1830), a drawing aid patented in 1806 by William Hyde Wollaston and manufactured by the Dollonds. At the Great Exhibition of 1851 he was awarded the council medal for his invention, a type of weather station in which instruments which measured variations in air pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and force and direction of the wind were caused to record on a roll of paper.<br>
<br>George Dollond died unmarried at his home at Camberwell Terrace North on 13 May 1852, and was buried on 20 May at Norwood cemetery. His property was bequeathed to his nephews and their children. He was highly respected by his contemporaries, and acquired a reputation for absolute honesty which led the Spectaclemakers' Company to entrust their investments to his care.<br>
<br>George Dollond had trained at least five apprentices through the Spectaclemakers' and Grocers' companies, including his nephew George Huggins (1797&#150;1866), son of his brother John, who was bound through the Grocers in 1812 and took his freedom in 1827. The younger George succeeded to the family business on his uncle's death and, following the family tradition, adopted the surname Dollond. When the second George Dollond died in 1866 the firm was taken over by his son, William (1834&#150;1893). In 1871 William Dollond became too ill to continue working, and he sold the firm to J. R. Chant, a former employee, who, though no Dollond family interest remained, nevertheless kept the trading name of Dollond. In 1928 the firm was acquired by James Aitchison, to become Dollond and Aitchison, and it thereafter concentrated increasingly on prescription spectacles.<br>
