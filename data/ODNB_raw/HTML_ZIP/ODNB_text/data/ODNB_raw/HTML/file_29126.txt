<span class="headword">Weston,  Richard</span>, first earl of Portland  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized at Chicheley, Buckinghamshire, on 1 March 1577, the elder son of Jerome (later Sir Jerome) Weston (<i>d</i>. 1603) of Skreens in Roxwell, Essex, and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1593), daughter and coheir of Anthony Cave of Chicheley; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29125/', "Sir Richard Weston (d. 1572)")</script> was his grandfather. His father was a conscientious mid-Essex JP from 1586 and a devoted captain of a trained band company of 600 foot, &#145;one of the fairest in the shire&#146; in the view of his deputy lieutenants, and one so big that he was excused the shrievalty while he remained in command  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/254/58). There seems to be no record of Richard's education before he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA early in 1594, and he entered the Middle Temple on 18 June following. He spent &#145;some years&#146; studying law, according to the earl of Clarendon, before travelling abroad, probably quite briefly late in the 1590s and possibly for the only time prior to service as an ambassador in 1620  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.59). About 1597 he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Pinchon of Writtle, Essex, and Rose, daughter of Thomas Reding of Pinner, Middlesex. She died in 1603, and was buried on 15 February at Roxwell, leaving one surviving son and two daughters. About two years later Weston married Frances, daughter of Nicholas Waldegrave of Borley and Catherine, daughter of Weston Browne of Rookwood Hall, Abbess Roding, Essex.<h2>
<a name="Earlypubliclife"></a>Early public life</h2>In 1601 Weston sat for Maldon in Essex in the first of seven consecutive parliaments as a commoner, always for different seats. He was knighted on 23 July 1603, a few months after his father. On Sir Jerome's death late in December 1603 Richard inherited Roxwell and other Essex estates, as well as property at Nayland in Suffolk. He was among the signatories to the indenture for the Essex shire election of 1604, which had much exercised its peers and gentry, but owed his own return to parliament to an early by-election for the Catholic Montagu family's seat at Midhurst in Sussex. By March 1607 he had become an Essex JP, remaining so for the rest of his life. In June 1612 the earl of Sussex nominated him as one of his deputy lieutenants for Essex and kept him in commission until July 1620. He returned in June 1623 but was left out, with the duke of Buckingham's approval, in September 1626, before coming back in January 1628. From 5 February 1629 until his death he served as joint lord lieutenant of Essex, intended as a courtly restraint on his puritanical partner, Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick. While his other interests allowed he contributed what he could to local administration, blending occasional out of sessions work with frequent attendances at quarter sessions and assizes until 1619&#150;20. He became a privy councillor in September 1621, and thereafter matters of state began to claim his whole attention. In the difficult days ahead he was to prove deaf to the urgings of his fellow deputy lieutenants and JPs to &#145;bee pleased upon all just occations to bee the patron and father of our countie&#146; (4 April 1627; Quintrell, no. 444). Between 1626 and 1629 the Essex deputies, with some difficulty, gained concessions from the council on at least seven occasions, based either on their heavy expenditure during an invasion threat in 1625 or on Elizabethan precedent; but there is no indication that Weston ever provided the help that other councillors sometimes did for counties with which they had an association.<br>
<br>Weston sat for the only time as a knight of the shire for Essex in the parliament of 1614 and, possibly under the influence of Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, pressed for action against the suspected practice of undertaking. Unlike his father he was not content with county life, but was moving into circles in the City and Whitehall where men of business mingled with hopeful courtiers. In 1615 he was busy assisting Sir Arthur Ingram in raising a loan for the lord treasurer, the earl of Suffolk, while in July of the following year he and his unstable eldest son, Richard, were jointly appointed collectors of petty customs in the port of London, with a life grant in February 1618. He paid &pound;1000 for the collectorship of the pretermitted customs in London about 1620 and held it until 1624. Lionel Cranfield's influence secured him a place in the commission for reducing the royal household's expenditure in November 1617, as it did in a more effective commission for the reform of the navy in June 1618. This had similar membership and, under the new lord admiral, the marquess of Buckingham, went on to implement its own recommendations and build ten new warships in the next five years. Weston was one of the commissioners for the East India Company chosen to negotiate with their Dutch counterparts about trading practices in July 1619, and was among those often named in newsletters as hopeful of substantial offices falling vacant in and around the court. As early as 8 January 1620 Chamberlain noted a rumour that he was about to join Fulke Greville, the chancellor of the exchequer, as his assistant and under-treasurer, and in the autumn, after filling the office informally for a month, Weston finally replaced Greville as chancellor of the exchequer on 7 November 1621. Seven years later Archie Armstrong recalled that the earl of Carlisle even then would have preferred him as lord treasurer, but Weston himself was content to serve under his friend Lionel Cranfield, whose elevation to the Lords as Baron Cranfield had recently enabled Weston to be returned to parliament at a by-election for the Howard seat at Arundel.<h2>
<a name="Chancelloroftheexchequeranddiplomat16211628"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer and diplomat, 1621&#150;1628</h2>During a fruitless embassy to Brussels and Prague with Sir Edward Conway in 1620, after James's son-in-law Frederick, the elector palatine, had paid a humiliating penalty for accepting an invitation from rebel noblemen to take the throne of Bohemia, and another embassy to Brussels in 1622 to press for the recovery of the Palatinate from Habsburg forces, Weston provided a shrewd commentary for Cranfield as well as for Buckingham. Unlike John Digby, earl of Bristol, at Madrid, Weston in 1622 was quick to appreciate the limits of Spanish influence and the emptiness of imperial assurances, and was by 1624 treading a characteristically cautious line between the king's continuing preference for peace and the offended sensibilities of a prince denied a Spanish match, who, as men of ambition could not afford to forget, represented a reversionary interest to which James feared Buckingham increasingly subscribed. Whereas in the 1624 parliament Cranfield's aversion to war enabled Buckingham to bring him down, Weston pursued a more subtle line, appreciating that calling off the treaties with Spain would necessitate precautionary funding on a substantial scale.<br>
<br>Weston's position remained a moderate one, by a narrow margin sufficiently acceptable to the king to ensure that at least temporarily he succeeded Cranfield in the treasury. Writing to Buckingham on 24 May, with the sealed patent to hand, Lord Keeper John Williams reported that Prince Charles had hoped his father would not have gone ahead with the appointment, and remained opposed, even though he &#145;durst not speak to crosse it&#146;; yet Williams also assured Buckingham that he himself did not doubt Weston's loyalty to the duke's interests, and concluded that he knew &#145;no fitter man in England for the office if he come in as a creature of the Prince and your Grace's; nor unfitter, if he should offer to take it without your likings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cabala</span>, 94). But although the acting treasurer's busy &#145;tricking and trimming&#146; of Winchester House, newly leased in August 1624 on his removal from Holborn, prompted speculation about a more secure future, and Conway reported that under his influence the king &#145;beginnes to instruct his large heart to keep intelligence with his Exchequer&#146;, a limit was soon put on his immediate aspirations (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.577; TNA: PRO, SP 14/175/48). Weston expected to be at Cambridge for Ambassador Ville-aux-Clerc's first audience, due to take place on 12 December 1624 prior to negotiations over the French marriage treaty, but at a late stage James decided he need not come. On 11 December James Ley, the elderly but still ambitious judge married to one of Buckingham's young nieces, was sworn in there by the king as the new treasurer and promptly ennobled, as Prince Charles's reservations about Weston as Cranfield's man belatedly took effect. Weston nevertheless remained chancellor of the exchequer and sat in the parliaments of 1624, 1625, and 1626 for Cornish seats where duchy influence was overlaid with Buckingham's interest: at Bossiney in 1624, Callington in 1625, and Bodmin in 1626.<br>
<br>As acting treasurer Weston had proved insistent on maintaining the full authority of his office, punctilious in observing proper administrative process, and unhesitating in suspending pensions and other claims on the exchequer by courtiers lacking what he considered to be adequate warrant. With the inexperienced Ley as treasurer he found it harder to keep his grip on finances, and struggled to accumulate the funds needed for wars with Spain and then also with France. Neither the 1625 nor 1626 parliament provided war supply. At the Oxford meeting in 1625 Weston was among those ministers relatively conversant with foreign affairs whose contribution was overshadowed by the prominence the king allowed Sir John Coke, a leading naval commissioner yet to be made a privy councillor, who performed resolutely in the king's presence at short notice but whose lack of seniority attracted much adverse comment. Nevertheless, in both parliaments Weston stressed the king's financial exigencies without conceding the impracticality of what he was attempting, and from firsthand experience was able to defend the duke's contribution to naval reform. He also exercised a moderating influence where he could, most notably in the case of Sir Thomas Wentworth. Drawing on his association with Cranfield and Ingram he managed to persuade Wentworth that there were sound practical reasons for tempering his criticisms of Charles's war policy, honest and well considered though they might be. In the process Wentworth lost all confidence in Buckingham's assurances of amity, followed as they invariably were by blows to his influence and esteem. Most, however, seem to have been the work of the king; and despite the duke's preference for the Saviles, Wentworth's rivals in Yorkshire, Weston persevered. Just before Buckingham's death in August 1628 he brought Wentworth into the ambit of court favour, and in the 1629 session of parliament Wentworth joined Weston, ennobled on 13 April 1628 as Baron Weston of Nayland, in the upper house. Soon afterwards he also managed formally to reconcile Arundel with the king, at odds since 1626.<br>
<br>Weston's own relationship with Buckingham was still compromised by his association with the fallen Cranfield, whose intermediary he continued to be, leaving him uncertain of the duke's approval. He assured Buckingham that summer that his expeditions had priority over all else, but he had not entirely escaped the sharp criticism which Ley's inadequacies drew from the king, and remained a man who ventured little. Buckingham's own political future, in urgent need as it was of an emphatic military success, had come to depend unduly on a cautious man bent on retrenchment, more concerned with shoring up the royal economy by reducing its expenditure and securing peace than he was with generating new revenues. For all his familiarity with the fevered language of the court the duke must have wondered at Sir Humphrey May's description of Weston in October 1627 as &#145;not a sparke but a flame of fire in any thinge that concernes you&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/80/60). He may have recalled that earlier that year Weston, never neglecting his own interests, had acquired the manor of Mortlake from the crown for a modest outlay, and had thus begun on the lavish development of his Roehampton estate, with intermittent help from Tobie Matthew, a courtier who had turned to Rome in 1606 and who by the mid-1620s was very probably a Jesuit priest.<h2>
<a name="Lordtreasurer16281635"></a>Lord treasurer, 1628&#150;1635</h2>Ley resigned as treasurer following the appointment on 26 June 1628 of a nine-man committee of councillors to report to the king on his financial obligations. Weston succeeded him on 15 July 1628, and may well have drawn on the committee's deliberations in setting out on 13 August his assessment of the state of the king's finances and proposals for remedial action. He astutely sent the details first to Buckingham so that he could deliver them to Charles and make sure that the king appreciated them. The paper was then to be destroyed, and nothing more done until the duke had set out on his impending expedition. Buckingham thus found himself closely associated with the economical measures the king wanted. Clarendon's speculation, long afterwards, that Buckingham would have had Weston &#145;cashiered&#146; on his return may reflect what the duke would have liked; but it is more probable that, had Buckingham not been assassinated that August, he would have learned to adapt to what the new lord treasurer hoped would become &#145;a quiett and settled court&#146; where &#145;rest and vigilancy&#146; would, in their different ways, remedy current financial failings (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.61; TNA: PRO, SP 16/112/75; TNA: PRO, SP 16/113/14). In the 1629 session of parliament Sir John Eliot, bitter that Wentworth was now enjoying court favour while he was not, adopted a different perspective in calling for the treasurer's impeachment: in Weston's person, he feared, &#145;is contracted all the evill that we doe suffer: If we looke either into religion or policye, I finde him building on the grounds layd by the Duke of Buckingham, his great Master&#146; (Notestein and Relf, 259; 2 March 1629). Like William Laud, Weston had no wish for the early recall of parliament in the 1630s. He felt much more comfortable with retrenchment by prerogative means, an approach which had been favoured by Northampton and Cranfield.<br>
<br>Although the absence of parliament was not to keep him from political hostility within the court, in less than seven years in office Weston paid off the bulk of the war debt (&pound;2 million in 1629), and added &pound;50,000 a year to the king's ordinary income, by then in excess of &pound;600,000 a year. As treasurer he served on all five of the council's standing committees and, despite occasional bouts of taciturnity, combined effectively with Sir Francis Cottington, who, as he had hoped, had replaced Edward Barrett as chancellor of the exchequer in March 1629. He worked closely with the customs farmers, restoring three-year grants of farms in December 1632, and improving customs revenues so that they represented almost one half of that total, and, with Cottington, he encouraged alderman Abraham Dawes, an experienced customer and (according to John Harrison) Weston's &#145;great creature&#146;, to draw up a well-contrived book of rates which, launched in 1636, swelled crown revenues in the later 1630s, although too much remained appropriated  (BL, Stowe MS 326, fol. 60<i>r</i>). Unlike his father Charles resorted to the expedient of distraint of knighthood, a levy on those of sufficient substance throughout the country who had failed to take up a knighthood they had not actually been offered at the time of his coronation, and he succeeded in legitimately tapping the wealth of the elusive mercantile and professional classes of London so effectively that overall &pound;174,000 was raised during the early 1630s with little resistance. Weston was less successful in his leadership of one of the two English fishing associations, intended to compete with the Dutch in the North Sea, and, despite his lengthy concern with naval reform and his current role as the most senior of the admiralty commissioners, he played a relatively minor part in introducing a new version of ship money in 1634&#150;5. Despite Weston's participation in recent negotiations with their agent Necolalde, the Spanish had failed to deliver financial support promised for Charles's growing fleet, which was intended to demonstrate his sovereignty of the British seas, partly for their benefit. Weston may not have welcomed an alternative means of funding which held out a distant prospect of direct parliamentary support for the navy, and was certainly agitated at the speed with which Charles insisted on having John Coke present an outline of his &#145;great business&#146; to the council early in June 1634  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 1.94). To his relief, and perhaps after his intervention, Coke in the event provided little more than a catalogue of obstructions to British trade in continental Europe and beyond, which matching assertiveness in home waters might remedy; no foreign policy or financial implications were raised. The managers of the new levy's introduction were leading courtiers with firmly Calvinist convictions, principally Lord Keeper Thomas Coventry, Lord Privy Seal Henry Montagu, earl of Manchester, and Secretary John Coke, assisted by the attorney-general of the day, William Noy. However, Noy died on 9 August 1634 and his successor, Sir John Bankes, was closer to Weston. The treasurer's hand may also be seen in the number of Catholic-leaning officers in the fleet of 1635, prompting the application of the oaths of supremacy and allegiance to those in command in 1636.<br>
<br>Weston's influence within the court was widely apparent by 1634. Although never a favourite he was firmly established in the king's regard from the early days of personal rule, and enjoyed the goodwill of the earls of Dorset, Carlisle, and especially Arundel. In April 1630 he had been the king's nomination for the chancellorship of Oxford, left vacant by the death of William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke, only for it to transpire that Laud had somehow already been elected. Weston did however succeed Pembroke as steward of Bristol, after accepting a similar office at Exeter in 1629. He was appointed to the Order of the Garter in April 1630, filling the vacancy left by Buckingham, and during the year commissioned from Hubert Le Sueur an equestrian statue of the king for the garden of his house at Roehampton. He leased Wallingford House, London, after the duke's death, and began to hold meetings of the admiralty commissioners there, prompting a rumour in June 1631 that he was about to become lord admiral.<br>
<br>During 1632 Weston sought to strengthen his association with the inner court by ambitious dynastic alliances. In June his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29123/', "Jerome Weston (1605&#150;1663)")</script>, married Lady Frances Stuart, the youngest daughter of the late Esm&eacute; Stuart, third duke of Lennox, the king's cousin, in a ceremony in the chapel at Roehampton attended by Charles and Henrietta Maria, at which Laud officiated; Arundel's heir had married her sister in 1626. In December Weston's daughter Anne married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9249/', "Basil Feilding")</script>, heir to William Feilding, first earl of Denbigh, whose wife, Susan, was Buckingham's sister and first lady of the queen's bedchamber; James Hamilton, third marquess of Hamilton, another courtier close to Charles, had already married a Feilding daughter. On 17 February 1633 Weston was created earl of Portland, a title reflecting a recent association with the strategically important county of Hampshire, where in February 1631 he had become sole lord lieutenant and captain of the Isle of Wight in succession to Edward Conway, Lord Conway, the former secretary of state. His kinsmen, the Tichbornes, who had never found their Catholicism a serious handicap to county office, had long been established there.<br>
<br>Portland's health had been uncertain since at least 1631, when Sir Edward Stanhope, in advising Wentworth against accepting the deputyship of Ireland, assumed that the treasurer was &#145;not likely to injoy his place long, his corpulency and corporall infirmityes fitt enoughe to subtract from whatt nature might have allowed him&#146;, and became more erratic in 1634 as kidney disease took hold  (Zagorin, 304). At much the same time his critics at court made a sustained attempt to undermine his entrenched position. Most prominent were his &#145;great opposite&#146;, Coventry, Archbishop Laud in vexed association with Wentworth, growing testy and untrusting in Ireland, and the earl of Holland, a fading favourite of the queen, upset at his inability to become lord admiral, and smarting at the disappointing outcome of a clash with Jerome Weston over interference with innocent correspondence of Henrietta Maria and himself with France early in 1633  (BL, Add. MS 35332, fol. 29<i>r</i>). A series of threads ran through their complaints. Coventry resented Weston's part in working against an early recall of parliament, looking increasingly improbable by 1632, and, like Sir John Eliot, deeply distrusted his popish connections. Laud allowed himself to be aggravated by Weston's enduring friendship with his old enemy, Bishop John Williams, and, like Wentworth, deplored his handling of business in both state and church, which combined a sluggish but self-righteous approach with an eye to his advantage rather than theirs. Henrietta Maria's favour, on which her husband insisted, was seldom wholehearted: not only did Weston take it upon himself to urge on her the economies imposed on the household in 1629&#150;30, but he had welcomed Cardinal Richelieu's survival of the &#145;Day of Dupes&#146;, and consistently advised Charles against inviting her exiled but extravagant mother, Marie de Medici, to live in England. He managed, too, to get the king to appoint his friend Sir John Bankes as Noy's successor in preference to her servant Finch. There were many others about the court, like Henry Cary, Viscount Falkland, Walter Aston, Lord Aston, Sir Thomas Roe, and Sir Henry Wotton, who, as either creditors or pensionaries of the crown, found themselves brusquely denied payments due to them. Further pleading served only to aggravate matters. As James I had noted, Weston had a sharp tongue, and continual ill health was not improving his temper. The king's subjects, he believed, had a duty to make sacrifices while he attended to his master's financial well-being. In time, such high-handedness left him so heavily dependent on the support of the king that he became openly fearful of losing it.<br>
<br>Portland was the more vulnerable, as Coventry and Eliot appreciated, because of his inescapable associations with popery and with Spain. His wife, Frances, had been born into one of the leading Essex Catholic families, the Waldegraves of Borley. In 1624 she and her children were held to have attended the Church of England sufficiently often, even if not communicating, to gain exemption for her husband from the list of Catholic office-holders then being drawn up by parliament, but in 1628 Weston had been named, alone among the king's leading ministers, in a mainly provincial list, as one &#145;vehemently suspected to be ill-affected in religion&#146; because of his household's failings, an assessment supported by his son Jerome's disqualification from the Commons after a double return for Gatton, a seat notoriously susceptible to popish influence  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, vol. 1). Lady Weston was seen again at church, despite keeping her own priests and being busy during the 1630s among the proselytizing women around the queen. Yet whatever parliament thought, English Catholics did not accept that Weston was among their number. He not only attended church, but helped his household chaplain, Dr James Halsey, to a prebend of Winchester Cathedral in 1631 and, as Laud later claimed, was sufficiently concerned with the church to advance the career of the scholarly bishop, Augustine Lindsell. But godly Calvinists noted that both men were Arminians, thus reinforcing their political reservations about Weston. He had dealt with Spanish and French diplomats at intervals since 1620 and, although not uncritically, was party with Cottington to the treatings in 1629&#150;30 which had sealed the peace with Spain and to the maritime negotiations since then, none of them welcome in godly circles. In February 1632, moreover, he took advantage of the death of Dudley Carleton, Viscount Dorchester, &#145;for a tyme [to] supplye the service&#146; of secretary of state himself, in order to dash Calvinist hopes of an agreement with the Swedes over recovery of the Lower Palatinate by force  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/211/74).<br>
<br>The antagonism increased in 1633&#150;4. Coventry, who was obstructive over recusant forfeitures early in 1633, joined with Laud the following May in attacking the popish soap monopolists, in whom Portland had an interest, and, with Manchester, later refused to draw the proclamation authorizing them to go ahead. In April 1634 Coventry and Laud took up the rumour that Portland had subverted the king's intention of selling just enough royal forest to cover the costs of building two new warships, the <i>James</i> and the <i>Unicorn</i>, by setting aside more than was needed and, having sold the surplus cheaply by arrangement, subsequently bought it back for himself. Clarendon believed he thus acquired the whole of Chute Forest; but it would have been a clumsy and impractical way of doing so, and there seems no hard evidence that Portland, who was then quite ill, dealt improperly with any part of the royal forest. The duke of Lennox and the duchess of Buckingham interceded on his behalf, and Charles demonstrated his belief in his innocence by inviting him to kiss his hand in open court at Greenwich on 24 May 1634.<br>
<br>A more sweeping attack on Portland, and those thought to be associated with him, came in the summer of 1634 when Holland, as chief justice in eyre south of Trent, conducted a court of justice seat in Dean Forest. Noy was too sick to accompany him, and his place was taken by the queen's attorney-general, Sir John Finch. How much Henrietta Maria knew of what they intended has never become clear; but it seems likely that Holland and Finch believed that their efforts to embarrass Weston, by prosecuting his supposed associates for alleged exploitation of Dean's resources, would be well received, even though the treasurer's standing with the king had been emphasized in May when he had been appointed to the newly constituted queen's court charged with administering the consort's estates. Finch reminded the court of justice seat of the widely held belief that, had the Spanish been defeated in 1588, English Catholics would have destroyed Dean, traditionally the staple source of timber for the royal navy. Not all the prosecutions were well grounded, and some of the fines were eventually reduced, but Portland was fearful enough to shed his friends, including his long-serving secretary, John Gibbons, leaving them to further prosecution, on other grounds, in the law courts at Westminster.<br>
<br>While rumours of his possible successor circulated Portland returned subdued from the waters at Tunbridge Wells, but he recovered his spirits by recalling the king's instruction &#145;to believe nothing of those things which may seem of importance, and are brought to me, till I speake with him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/273/64, 22 Aug 1634). Within a month he was trying to rout his critics. At the end of a council meeting on 29 September 1634 he asked the king to stay while he laid a complaint. Laud made to defend himself, but Portland indicated that he was aiming at Coventry, who had evidently been reflecting on his fondness for gratuities. Charles refused to hear them out, but ordered Portland to provide him with a list of gifts and payments since July 1628. It amounted to &pound;44,000 and duly met with royal approval on 21 October. Charles himself was responsible for the biggest sum&#151;&pound;10,000 bestowed &#145;within a while &hellip; for his present support&#146;&#151;while Burlamachi, anxious to extricate himself from impending bankruptcy, had, as the king knew, given &pound;9000  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 1.158). The other fourteen contributions were smaller. The list suggests that Portland averaged at least &pound;7000 a year in perquisites, in itself not an unusual sum for a lord treasurer, and acceptable to the king, but it is not likely to have been exhaustive.<br>
<br>Portland again reacted sharply when Sir Anthony Pell's bill, &#145;of strange coinage&#146; as Laud put it, came before Star Chamber late in 1634  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 7.97). The defendants were Sir James Bagg, Sir Richard Tichborne, Gibbons, and another of Portland's secretaries, William Lake, and it cast an oblique shadow over his activities while concentrating on those of his subordinates. He intervened after the defendants, in his absence, had entered a demurrer on 26 November. On 1 December, according to James Howell, Portland &#145;out of the light of honour and innocencye knowne to himself and beleeved in the accused &hellip; wa[i]ved it in court and pressed a proceedinge to proofe&#146;. He readily acknowledged what some privy councillors had said earlier, that his &#145;Honour could not be vindicated in any Place more properly than in this [court] &hellip; Therefore&#146;, he added, &#145;I desire that this Business may be ordered to be heard with all Speed&#146;. Howell thought it risky, for &#145;if it fayle [it] will like a stone fall heavie on the thrower's head&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 16/278/3; <span class="italic">Earl of Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 1.377&#150;8); in the event it was Pell who had reason to feel sore. Such was Portland's determination to protect his interests towards the end of his life that in his last two active months, January and February 1635, he was attending routine meetings of the privy council more frequently than he had done for years. Customarily he had been present at one meeting in three; but on the evidence of the council register he managed to attend twelve of the eighteen meetings to 22 February, most of them when the king was present as well as his leading critics.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>Portland died on 13 March 1635 at Wallingford House, &#145;in great pain, entring his bed not above one hour&#146; before, according to the account given to George Garrard by his friend Lord Cottington  (<span class="italic">Earl of Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 1.389). Laud and Bishop Matthew Wren offered to attend him, but Tobie Matthew was at hand, and it was &#145;whispered and believed he died a Roman Catholick&#146;  (ibid.). Charles had briefly visited him shortly after giving him charge of Winchester Castle. Appropriately for the lord lieutenant of Hampshire he was buried, on 24 March, in Winchester Cathedral, where a bronze effigy, thought to be by Francesco Fanelli, was erected in the north-east chapel. Depressed by the state of his own finances Portland had proved reluctant to turn to testamentary matters. There was said to be less than &pound;100 in the house at the time of his death. On 9 March Cottington, &#145;with much difficulty &hellip; brought him &hellip; to make his will, asking him, from his wife to his youngest child, what he would bequeath to them&#146;, so that Attorney-General Bankes, at the bedside, could get down the details  (<span class="italic">Earl of Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 1.388). Yet, although formally drawn up, and signed and sealed by Portland at the time, the will does not seem ever to have been sent for probate. Cottington's questions had necessarily been direct and specific, concerned with essentials and not attempting to range over the whole of Portland's financial affairs and miscellaneous assets. No mention, for example, was made of his plate, some of which was sold for &pound;1200 to pay for his burial, or of the &pound;12,000 which Charles had given him at Christmas 1634 or, indeed, of the inheritance of Jerome, his eldest son from his second marriage, regarded as his heir even before the death of his first son Richard &#145;mad and kept at Coventry&#146; in April 1634  (<span class="italic">Earl of Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 1.243). Garrard reckoned that Portland left land and property worth at best &pound;6600 a year, but charged with debts of at least &pound;25,000. His widow had &pound;1500 p.a. for her jointure and was given the use of Roehampton for life; of their younger children, Thomas got the Roxwell estate (worth &pound;600 p.a., and promptly sold), Nicholas and Benjamin were left annuities of &pound;300, Mary received &pound;4000 and Catherine (who married Richard White of Hutton, Essex) &pound;1000. His daughters from his first marriage, Elizabeth, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19908/', "Sir John Netterville")</script>, and Mary, wife of Walter Aston, second Baron Aston, and two daughters from his second, Anne Feilding (who predeceased him by three days) and Frances, wife of a staunchly Catholic Staffordshire squire, Philip Draycott of Paynesbury, went unnoticed. The sole executor was Jerome, who, his father hoped, would find a suitable place at court and make his seat at Winchester. A report in 1634 that Jerome was about to replace secretary Coke had proved ill-founded, and his father's strenuous efforts in his last days to secure him the mastership of the court of wards came to nothing. Charles was prepared to protect his treasurer but not to promote a ministerial dynasty.<br>
<br>Portland was the first lord treasurer to die in office since Robert Cecil in 1612. That he did so owed much to Charles's determination to support a minister who set out to achieve financial stability without resort to novel ways, and on such terms Portland served his master well. But the king's experiences in the early 1630s, and the tensions within the treasury commission after Portland's death, persuaded him of the almost equally pressing need to establish a quiet and settled court. William Juxon, who was chosen to succeed Portland in 1636, carried little contentious baggage even though he was a senior bishop, and, in Sir Henry Wotton's words, seemed &#145;the very reverse of his proud predecessor who made a scorn of my poverty and a sport of my modesty&#146;  (Smith, 2.375). Without Buckingham as a focal point for court politics Portland had found himself subjected to continual criticism from rival interests on a variety of fronts, and his religious ambivalence and conspicuous expenditure made him an easy target. So did his erratic manner, at times overbearing, at others fearful. The nature and extent of his errors and excesses is by no means entirely clear, however, and it seems unlikely that he profited from office to the degree his enemies believed he did. Nevertheless he felt isolated, and grew notably anxious that those corresponding with the court should not pass him by. Although he was party to many of Charles's more confidential dealings he lacked the status of a favourite and his patronage, both political and cultural, was circumscribed, primarily directed to procuring from the king those he wanted around him like Cottington, Bankes, and Secretary Sir Francis Windebank. As a creature of the court he had limited time and little inclination to develop local connections, yet he proved unable to build an effective body of support at the centre; even Cottington found himself torn between Portland and Wentworth. Wentworth, whom Portland had once brought into favour but then helped to remove to Ireland, prudently let him know before he left for Dublin that he remained &#145;the very principall&#146; of his courtly friends, but on Portland's death confessed himself to be &#145;delivered from the heaviest adversary&#146; he ever had  (<span class="italic">Earl of Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 1.79, 411). Like Wotton, who deeply regretted his misjudgement in sending the treasurer a eulogy &#145;of the richest materials&#146; as a new year's gift in 1633, he could now lay such conceits aside  (Smith, 2.334, 375). Portland had come to depend almost entirely on the king, who knew his value and did not desert him. In a few years he had done much, by imposing economies on others, to stabilize royal finances; but at the last he found it hard to face up to the extravagant confusion in which he was leaving his own.<br>
