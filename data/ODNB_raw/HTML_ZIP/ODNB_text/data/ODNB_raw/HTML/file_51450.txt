</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anderson,  Mary</span>  (1859&#150;1940), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Sacramento, California, USA, on 28 July 1859, the daughter of Charles Henry Anderson (<i>d</i>. 1863) and his wife, Antonia Leugers, and named Mary Antoinette. Her mother, a Philadelphian of German, staunchly Catholic descent, had been disowned by her family after eloping to California with Anderson, a highly cultured but worldly New Yorker of English stock, fresh from a university education at Oxford. In 1860 the young couple moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where Mary's father later joined the Confederate army, only to be killed in action at Mobile while still in his twenties; Mary was then three and her brother, Charles Joseph, just a few months old. Mary was educated at the Ursuline convent and subsequently the Academy of the Presentation Nuns in Louisville, but proved an idle, somewhat rebellious pupil, her sole enthusiasm being to learn by heart long passages from Shakespeare and recite them aloud. This histrionic flair was encouraged by her stepfather, Dr Hamilton Griffin, a former surgeon in the Southern army and aficionado of the bard's work, whom her mother had married in 1867, and at the age of fourteen Mary was taken to see Edwin Booth play Hamlet, whereupon she announced her intention of becoming an actress. Some tuition in elocution was arranged locally, and she was sent to New York to study under the veteran performer George Vandenhoff, who gave her ten lessons, virtually her only professional training.<br>
<br>On her return the publicity-conscious manager of the Louisville theatre, Barney Macauley, asked Mary to play Juliet in a benefit performance on Saturday 27 November 1875, and was sufficiently impressed to engage her for a whole week early in the new year to appear with his stock company not only as Juliet but also as Julia in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span>, Bianca in H. H. Milman's tragedy <span class="italic">Fazio</span>, and in the title role of <span class="italic">Evadne</span> by R. L. Sheil. Further engagements quickly followed, at St Louis and New Orleans and at John McCullough's theatre in San Francisco, allowing her to add other major characters to her repertory, namely Pauline in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>, Parthenia, the heroine of Mrs Lovell's beauty-and-beast romance <span class="italic">Ingomar the Barbarian</span>, and, with considerable audacity for a girl of sixteen, the Gypsy Meg Merrilies in an adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>, a role still identified with the recently deceased <i>grande dame</i> of American theatre, Charlotte Cushman. Soon she was offered a contract by John T. Ford to star at his Washington theatre, where, in January 1877, she played Lady Macbeth and embarked on an extensive tour of the Middle West and South, leading at the year's end to a six-week engagement in New York at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, which was the scene of her metropolitan d&eacute;but on 12 November in <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>. Press reviews of this performance were mixed, though there was praise for a &#145;tall, willowy&#146; actress of &#145;much dramatic potentiality&#146;, if as yet unfinished. The public, however, here as elsewhere, instantly took her to their hearts and signalled their devotion by dubbing her Our Mary.<br>
<br>Thus began a twelve-year starring career of unbroken success and mounting acclaim, marked by repeated engagements in New York and lengthy tours at the head of her own company, which filled the coffers of theatre managers wherever Anderson went. She also broadened her range of parts to include Berthe in a translation of <span class="italic">La fille de Roland</span> by Henri de Bornier, the Countess in a revival of Sheridan Knowles's comedy <span class="italic">Love</span>, the Duchess de Torrenueva in James Robinson Planch&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Faint Heart Ne'er Won Fair Lady</span>, Ion in Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd's tragedy of that name, Galatea in W. S. Gilbert's <span class="italic">Pygmalion and Galatea</span>, and Desdemona in <span class="italic">Othello</span>. This triumphal progress was briefly interrupted in the summer of 1879 for a voyage to Europe, where she visited Stratford upon Avon, London, and Paris, and met the two reigning doyennes of the international stage, Sarah Bernhardt and Adelaide Ristori. Returning to London in September 1883 for a season at the Lyceum during Henry Irving's absence in New York, she found herself engulfed by an even greater tide of popularity than at home, and her engagement stretched into a two-year residence while Irving remained busy in America. She chose the virginal Parthenia for her London opening, and proceeded to regale audiences at measured intervals with most of the roles which had assured her transatlantic reputation, but in January 1884 was able to add a new one in Clarice, the actress wife in <span class="italic">Comedy and Tragedy</span>, which Gilbert wrote expressly for her. Towards the end of her stay she was invited to the Memorial Theatre at Stratford to play Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, a creation which, with Clarice, she took back to the United States and toured from coast to coast. Featuring most of her London company and Johnston Forbes-Robertson as her leading man, the tour met with universal acclaim, intensified no doubt by knowledge of her success abroad. In London again in September 1887, she appeared as Perdita as well as Hermione in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, becoming the first actress to play both parts and publishing an edited version of the text which accommodated the doubling. After an unprecedented run of over 160 performances this production, too, was taken back to the United States the following autumn, but was destined to bring her extraordinary career to an abrupt halt. During a performance at Albaugh's Theatre in Washington on 7 March 1889 she collapsed on stage and was unable to continue. Suffering from severe nervous exhaustion, compounded perhaps by a growing distaste for some aspects of her profession, she disbanded her company and announced her retirement.<br>
<br>Ordered to take a prolonged rest, Anderson sailed east. In London, on 17 June the following year, she married Antonio Fernando de Navarro (<i>d</i>. 1932), a fellow American practising as a barrister in England. They had two children, a son, Jos&eacute;, and a daughter, Elena, and settled at Court Farm in Broadway, Worcestershire. There Mary became a noted hostess, welcoming guests from a distinguished circle of musical and literary friends and ecclesiastical acquaintances of her husband, who was a papal chamberlain and knight commander of Saint Gregory. Subsequently she resisted every inducement to return to the stage, emerging from retirement only to take part in a number of benefit performances in aid of war charities during the First World War. She published two books of memoirs, <span class="italic">A Few Memories</span> (1896) and <span class="italic">A Few More Memories</span> (1936), and collaborated with Robert Hichens on a stage adaptation of his novel <span class="italic">The Garden of Allah</span>, produced at the Century Theatre, New York, in 1911. Predeceased by her husband by eight years, she died at home at Court Farm on 29 May 1940.<br>
<br>Mary Anderson possessed two distinct advantages as a performer, great physical beauty and a clear, expressive voice. George Odell, the annalist of the New York theatre, pronounced her &#145;the most beautiful woman I ever saw on the stage, or, for that matter, off the stage&#146;, and remembered her voice as &#145;a rich contralto&#146;  (Odell, 10.372&#150;3). Such was her allure that artists vied to paint her portrait or design her costumes, while photographs of her appeared in countless magazines and were used to advertise soap or a make of corset. Opinion was divided, however, among critics and fellow professionals alike, about the quality of her acting. For some there was an innate nobility in her every action, her modulation of delivery could bring tears to the eyes, and, in William Winter's words, &#145;she filled the scene with her presence, and she filled the hearts of her audience with a &hellip; conviction of the possible loveliness and majesty of the human soul&#146;  (Winter, <span class="italic">Other Days</span>, 276). Others considered her too statuesque by half, wanting in subtlety and restraint, her beauty and declamatory power serving only to draw attention to themselves to the detriment of the ensemble. Significantly, her stage experience was confined to eighteen leading roles: advised by Charlotte Cushman to &#145;start at the top&#146; if she wished to be a star, she later prided herself on never having played a secondary role, and this relative lack of apprenticeship may account for allegations by her detractors that her acting relied on a limited range of devices employed indiscriminately regardless of context, and never displayed a truly imaginative grasp of character. But her popular appeal was undeniable, and for most members of the audience outweighed all other considerations. Certainly, few performers have been able to inspire such affection.<br>
