<span class="headword">Witt,  Johannes  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1566&#150;1622), <span class="occ">humanist and visitor to London</span>, was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands, the son of Steven de Witt (<i>d</i>. 1572), knight, and his second wife, Machteld Bruininck Foeck. De Witt was descended from a respectable Utrecht family, several of whose members had distinguished themselves as legal specialists in public office. When Johannes was six years old his father died, and the child was committed to the care of an uncle, the prebendary Jacob Foeck. He read letters (and presumably also law) at Leiden University, where he heard Justus Lipsius, and he also studied at the Catholic University of Douai, together with Aernout van Buchell 
    (Arnoldus Buchelius; 1565&#150;1641)
  , his boyhood friend and lifelong correspondent. For reasons that remain obscure, de Witt was in Paris from July 1585 to May 1586.<br>
<br>Following his studies, de Witt settled on the family estate of Wiltenburg, near Utrecht. In 1596 he was in London, and reported on four public theatres, two of which he mentioned by name, the Rose and the Swan. Of special interest is the latter, whose &#145;intersignium est <i>cignus</i> (vulgo le theater off te cijn)&#146; and whose interior de Witt described and drew. The famous drawing that survives is a copy (perhaps of a later copy produced by de Witt himself of his own original sketch), made by van Buchell during the late 1590s or early 1600s. The drawing, discovered in 1880, is in van Buchell's writing book, which also contains excerpts that he kept of additional letters from Witt and others. It is now in Utrecht University Library (MS 842, fol. 132<i>r</i>), and is one of the most important documents in Elizabethan theatre history.<br>
<br>De Witt became a prebendary of St Mary's at Utrecht on 1 October 1608. The twelve years' truce between Spain and the protestant north (1609&#150;21), together with the waiver of his duty to reside in Utrecht, created an opportunity for this devout Roman Catholic to realize one of his greatest ambitions, a journey to Rome. He left Utrecht in 1610, and his first stop (via Antwerp, from where he sent van Buchell two small notebooks) was Paris, where he stayed for a rather surprising number of years (1611&#150;17), preparing, as he himself relates in a letter to Gilles van Ledenbergh (1615), editions of &#145;Historia Caroli VI. Francorum rex&#146;, &#145;Passchasii Rathberti abbatis opera&#146;, &#145;Fulgentis opuscula aliquot&#146;, and the poems of Nicolas Braja (&#145;Po&euml;mata de gestis Ludovici VIII&#146;). None of this work seems to have been published.<br>
<br>Following a detour via Angers and Tours, de Witt arrived in Lyons in the spring of 1618 and reached the holy city in December the following year. There he established friendships with Dutch painters resident there. Health problems did not prevent him from taking journeys to Monti Albani and Naples. Plans to return to the Low Countries via Venice and Germany were not to be realized. De Witt died in Rome on 30 September 1622, leaving his various collections of antiquities to a friend in the city, Johannes Honorius Axelius.<br>
