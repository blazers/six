<span class="headword">Graham,  Jocelyn Henry Clive <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1874&#150;1936), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 23 December 1874 in London, the second child of Sir Henry John Lowndes Graham (1842&#150;1930), clerk of the parliaments, and his first wife, Lady Edith Elizabeth Gathorne-Hardy (<i>d</i>. 1875), daughter of the first earl of Cranbrook. Graham's mother died when he was two weeks old, but he later felt himself fortunate in having in Sir Henry &#145;the most perfect of fathers&#146;  (family papers). In 1884 Sir Henry married Lady Margaret Georgina Compton, daughter of the fourth marquess of Northampton, and had three further children. Harry Graham was educated at Eton College and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and joined the Coldstream Guards in 1895. Between 1898 and 1904 he was aide-de-camp to the earl of Minto, governor-general of Canada, with a gap in 1901&#150;2, when he served in the South African War.<br>
<br>Under the pseudonym &#145;Col. D. Streamer&#146;, a pun on his regiment, in 1899 Graham published <span class="italic">Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes</span>, for which he is best known. Forerunners of the sick joke, unlike <span class="italic">Struwwelpeter</span> they contain no moral to mitigate the enjoyable beastliness. Whereas Hoffmann's Pauline goes up in flames because she disobeys her mother, in &#145;Tender-heartedness&#146; Graham visits the same fate on Billy without any attempt to edify:<blockquote>
<div>Billy, in one of his nice new sashes,<br>
</div>
<div>Fell in the fire and was burnt to ashes;<br>
</div>
<div>Now, although the room grows chilly,<br>
</div>
<div>I haven't the heart to poke poor Billy.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Ruthless Rhymes</span> reflected an upbringing in which almost nothing was off-limits as a subject for humour. &#145;My family would think me very ill if I ever said anything in a letter that wasn't absolutely flippant&#146;, the nineteen-year-old Graham wrote to a friend  (family papers). Sir Henry was a pianist, singer, and songwriter whose <span class="italic">Six Drawing-Room Ditties</span>&#151;&#145;Oh, what a shape hers! Cutting her capers.&#146;&#151;were an early influence. Graham impressed Lady Minto by writing, producing, and starring in musical shows. The governor-general was less happy when his aide-de-camp published a comic poem about Theodore Roosevelt that included the lines:<blockquote>
<div>Though jealous rivals dared to scoff,<br>
</div>
<div>He wore the smile-that-won't-come-off.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Lord Minto commented, &#145;I am furious &hellip; it's all wrong for one of my staff to be making fun of the President&#146;. But he later wrote: &#145;Harry quite awful and makes me hysterical he is so amusing&#146;  (Bowles, xi&#150;xiii).<br>
<br>Graham was private secretary to the former prime minister Lord Rosebery from 1904 to 1906, when he became a full-time writer. He was briefly engaged to the American actress Ethel Barrymore, who found him &#145;a gay, brilliant creature&#146; but decided not to marry him  (Barrymore, 144&#150;6). He tried biography&#151;<span class="italic">Splendid Failures</span> has sympathetic portraits of Wolfe Tone, Toussaint l'Ouverture, and Hartley Coleridge&#151;but his speciality was the comic poem, without the brutal succinctness of <span class="italic">Ruthless Rhymes</span> but dotted with biting observations, as in &#145;Forms of address&#146;, which appeared in <span class="italic">Deportmental Ditties</span> (1909):<blockquote>
<div>Then make it a rule, if you're bent on succeeding,<br>
</div>
<div>To show every sign of good birth and good breeding,<br>
</div>
<div>To do what is thought <i>comme-il-faut</i> and <i>de rigueur</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>To browbeat the poor and to bully the nigger.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>On 8 February 1910 Graham married Dorothy (1879&#150;1942), daughter of Sir Francis Hyde Villiers, British ambassador in Brussels, and widow of Captain Hugh Keith-Fraser. When war was declared in 1914 he was nearly forty, but he rejoined his regiment, dealing with disciplinary lapses such as &#145;the glorious crime&#146; of &#145;looking at the sergeant-major in an old-fashioned manner&#146;  (Graham papers). From 1917 he served in France, and saw many horrors. But he continued writing and following the progress of musical comedies to which he had contributed lyrics. <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span> (1917) ran for a record 1352 performances at Daly's, in London; its best-known song, &#145;Love will Find a Way&#146;, is characteristic of dozens of lyrics turned out by Graham over the next fifteen years. At one point, in 1924, there were seven productions in which he was involved  (Bowles, xvi). Many were set in &#145;that imaginary country in Central Europe, which has to be imaginary because no actual country ever could be governed on such pleasantly frivolous lines&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Feb 1931).<br>
<br>Graham's facility allowed him to ring innumerable changes on the theme of young love, although he used his comic gift when he could. In the Gilbertian &#145;I understood&#146; the narrator tells of his failed attempts at love, borrowing, and insurance selling with the refrain:<blockquote>
<div>He didn't say he wouldn't and he didn't say he would,<br>
</div>
<div>He didn't have to say a single word&#151;I understood.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Graham's most popular song, made famous by Richard Tauber, was &#145;You are my heart's delight&#146;, from <span class="italic">The Land of Smiles</span>, with music by Franz Leh&aacute;r. <span class="italic">White Horse Inn</span>, also translated by Graham from the German, had hits with the title-song and &#145;Goodbye&#146; (&#145;I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed&#146;). In his comic prose there is evidence that Graham influenced P. G. Wodehouse, who is on record as an admirer  (private information). In <span class="italic">The Bolster Book</span> (1910) he invented a club for rich young boneheads, the Celibates, with dialogue that pre-echoed Wodehouse's &#145;Drones&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1930, with <span class="italic">More Ruthless Rhymes</span>, Graham revisited what the poet Gavin Ewart called the &#145;epigrammatic squib&#146;  (Ewart, 91). &#145;Indifference&#146; finds him as casually mordant as ever:<blockquote>
<div>When Grandmamma fell off the boat,<br>
</div>
<div>And couldn't swim (and wouldn't float),<br>
</div>
<div>Matilda just stood by and smiled.<br>
</div>
<div>I almost could have slapped the child.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Ewart believed Graham &#145;was not much inferior&#146; to Gilbert as a versifier. When he died a fourth leader in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (31 October 1936) described <span class="italic">Ruthless Rhymes</span> as &#145;that enchanted world where there are no values nor standards of conduct or feeling, and where the plainest sense is the plainest nonsense&#146;.<br>
<br>Despite his sharpness with the pen Graham was widely liked. He lunched at his clubs&#151;the Beefsteak and the Garrick&#151;and did his best work in the small hours. &#145;Tall, lean and soldierly&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Nov 1936), he accentuated his military bearing with a Kitchener-style moustache. His only child, Virginia Graham (1910&#150;1993), followed him as a writer, contributing many articles to <span class="italic">Punch</span>. Graham died of cancer in London on 30 October 1936.<br>
