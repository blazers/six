<span class="headword">Copinger,  Walter Arthur</span>  (1847&#150;1910), <span class="occ">jurist and author</span>, was born on 14 April 1847 in Clapham, the second son of Charles Louis George Emanuel Copinger (1821&#150;1866), colonel in the American army, and his wife, Mary, widow of George James, and daughter of Thomas Pearson of Shepperton, Middlesex. Educated at the private school of John Andrews at Wellesley House, Brighton, he entered University College, Durham, but left without completing his course to join the office of a relative who was a solicitor in London. He did not remain there long. In 1866 he was admitted a student of the Middle Temple, and after spending a short time in the chambers of T. Bourdillon, a well-known conveyancing counsel, he was called to the bar on 26 January 1869.<br>
<br>After his call to the bar Copinger turned his attention to the law of copyright, and in 1870 he published his <span class="italic">Law of Copyright in Works of Literature and Art</span>. The work went through several editions and was revised in the 1920s; a tenth edition appeared in 1965. Also in 1870 Copinger settled in Manchester, and began practice as an equity draftsman and conveyancer, and in the chancery court of the county palatine of Lancaster. His work as a conveyancer increased so rapidly that he soon ceased to take court work and became the leading conveyancer out of London. At the same time he was widely consulted on questions of copyright. He had a strong grasp of the intricacies of the law, especially that relating to real property. He was sharp, and had a good memory, powerful concentration, and an easy style of draftsmanship. Pupils found his chambers an admirable school of training: he was said to have the power of making law live. On 3 September 1873 he married Caroline Agnes, eldest daughter of Thomas Inglis Stewart, vicar of Landscove, Devon; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Amid his heavy professional work Copinger continued to write on legal subjects, more particularly on conveyancing. Between 1872 and 1886 he published several large works on this and related topics. In 1876 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Abolition of Capital Punishment</span> which, to his amusement, was so enthusiastically received by the abolitionists that his intention to publish another pamphlet demolishing all the arguments in the first was abandoned.<br>
<br>In 1888 Copinger was appointed lecturer in law in the Owens College, Manchester, and in 1892, upon the resignation of Professor Munro, he became professor of law, and finally dean of the faculty of law in the Victoria University, Manchester. He received the Lambeth degree of doctor of laws from Archbishop Benson in 1889, and that of MA from the Victoria University in 1905. He was president of the Manchester Law Society's library.<br>
<br>Copinger pursued versatile interests with untiring industry. Besides being an expert in old property law, he was also a keen bibliographer and antiquary, and took a deep interest in theology. Unfortunately all his bibliographical and historical work lacks the essential quality of minute accuracy. Largely owing to his efforts, supported by Richard Copley Christie, the Bibliographical Society was founded in London in 1892; he was the society's first president, and held the office for four years, doing much to establish the society on a firm basis. Between 1895 and 1898 he published his most important bibliographical work, the <span class="italic">Supplement to Hain's Repertorium bibliographicum</span>, comprising 7000 corrections of and additions to the collations of fifteenth-century works described or mentioned by Hain, and a list of nearly 6000 works not referred to by Hain. This work extends to upwards of 1630 closely printed double-column pages. Copinger contributed several papers to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Bibliographical Society</span>, including an exhaustive monograph on the fifteenth-century printed editions of Virgil. In 1892 he published a bibliographical account of 124 editions of the Latin <span class="roman">Bible</span> printed between 1450 and 1500. At The Priory, Greenheys, Manchester, his home at the time, he set up a small press, at which he printed four bibliographical works for private circulation.<br>
<br>Copinger was equally keenly interested in genealogy, heraldry, and manorial history. In 1882 he published his <span class="italic">History of the Copingers or Coppingers</span>, in which he traced the descent of his family from the Danes in the tenth century, when they appear to have settled in Suffolk and in the south of Ireland. His last years were devoted almost exclusively to the history of Suffolk. Between 1902 and his death he produced a stream of work on this subject, including a five-volume general history of Suffolk and a work on the manors of Suffolk which ran to seven volumes. He also published work on heraldry.<br>
<br>In religion Copinger was an Irvingite, and for a number of years was the angel, or minister, of the Catholic Apostolic church in Manchester. His interest in theology was wide and deep. The work which he valued most among his writings was his huge treatise on <span class="italic">Predestination, Election, and Grace</span> (1889). He also wrote six other works on theological subjects.<br>
<br>Copinger mainly found all the relaxation which he allowed himself in a change of work; but music always attracted him. He played several instruments, including the piano and violin, and found time to compose a number of musical pieces, including a collection of seventy-five original hymn tunes.<br>
<br>Copinger was an ardent book collector, and accumulated a considerable library. It was rich in early printed books, <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, manuscripts, and printed editions of Thomas &agrave; Kempis's <span class="italic">Imitatio Christi</span>, hymnbooks, Elzevier editions, and general works of reference. Genial and affable, he was always ready to place his knowledge and his library at the disposal of any student.<br>
<br>Copinger died, a widower, at his home, Ormonville, Lower Broughton, Salford, on 13 March 1910 from pneumonia following an attack of influenza, and was buried at Birch, Rusholme, Manchester.<br>
