<span class="headword">McIntosh, Sir  Ian Stewart</span>  (1919&#150;2003), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 11 October 1919 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the only son of Alexander James McIntosh (1890&#150;1973) and his wife, Islay Stewart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McArthur (1893&#150;1985). He was educated at Geelong grammar school, but left early to pursue a career in the Royal Navy, which he entered as a special entry cadet, gaining the king's dirk for passing out in first place in that entry in 1940.<br>
<br>McIntosh volunteered for service in submarines and, as a newly promoted sub-lieutenant, took passage in the troopship <i>Britannia</i> to join the 1st submarine flotilla, then based in Alexandria, Egypt, via the Cape. On 25 March 1941 the <i>Britannia</i> was intercepted and sunk by the German merchant raider <i>Thor</i> in the central Atlantic. McIntosh took his appointed station in lifeboat 7, which eventually was manned by eighty-two people, far in excess of its safe capacity. The party included three other naval officers and one from the merchant navy, and all contributed to the conduct of the subsequent voyage, but from McIntosh's later modest account it is clear that he emerged as a leader, as well as showing personal courage in plugging shot-holes under water. The most important decision that had to be taken was which way to go: towards the nearer African coast, or that of Brazil. With a rudimentary sailing rig and some knowledge of winds and currents, they rightly chose the latter. The voyage took twenty-three days; there was very little food (the ration was an eggcup-full of water, one ship's biscuit, and a smear of condensed milk on the hand, twice a day), much exposure, and deaths were frequent. When the boat finally beached on the Brazilian coast only thirty-eight had survived. Aided by villagers, themselves extremely poor (&#145;Neither before nor since&#146;, McIntosh wrote, &#145;can I remember such generosity from people with so little to spare&#146;; &#145;Lifeboat no. 7&#146;), the party made their way to the provincial capital S&atilde;o Luiz, and eventually were repatriated to England. During this voyage, McIntosh said, he had been sustained by two things: the epic journey of Captain William Bligh after the <i>Bounty</i> mutiny, which he had studied in some detail and the boat's navigation had emulated, and the memory of a beautiful Norwegian girl, Elizabeth Rosemary Rasmussen (1923&#150;1995), whom he had met in Australia. They married in Wallington, Surrey, two years later, on 30 March 1943. She was the daughter of Albert Henry Rasmussen, a lieutenant in the Royal Norwegian Air Service. They had three sons, and a daughter who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Made MBE later in 1941 for the lifeboat exploit, McIntosh quickly forged ahead toward submarine command, commissioning the newly built <i>Sceptre</i> in 1943. It was an outstandingly successful command. In several war patrols <i>Sceptre</i> sank some 18,000 tons of axis shipping, one small surface combatant, and a supply submarine. However, the most unusual task was towing, on three separate occasions, midget submarines (X-craft) to attack targets in the Norwegian fjords. The first was the battleship <i>Tirpitz</i>, and of the six X-craft involved, two laid their charges successfully, putting the ship out of action for seven months. Some months later <i>Sceptre</i> supported <i>X-24</i> in an attack on a floating dock off Bergen; a large merchant ship was destroyed by mistake, so the operation was repeated six months later and the dock was duly sunk. These operations had required highly professional skills of navigation and submarine handling, as well as daring and initiative, and in 1944 McIntosh added a DSO to his MBE and the DSC awarded for service in the submarine <i>Thrasher</i> in 1942.<br>
<br>After the war McIntosh commanded several submarines with distinction, and in 1956 became executive officer of the aircraft carrier <i>Ark Royal</i>. In this exacting appointment, which demanded a sure touch in co-ordinating the ship's general activities with the operation of the air group, his success was recognized by early promotion to the rank of captain. He then returned to submarines in command of the 2nd submarine squadron before being appointed captain of the aircraft carrier <i>Victorious</i> in 1966. This successful commission, in an old, albeit extensively refitted ship, led to promotion to rear admiral in 1968, in which rank, and subsequently that of vice-admiral, to which he was promoted in 1971, he took up a new m&eacute;tier in the field of operational requirements, first on the naval staff (1968&#150;70) and then as a deputy chief of defence staff (1971&#150;3). In this post he carried through the project for the Sea Harrier aircraft, which was crucial in the south Atlantic campaign some years later.<br>
<br>Throughout his career, into the highest ranks, McIntosh was a byword for courtesy, intellectual breadth, and relaxed leadership that inspired confidence and affection. One national serviceman later recalled McIntosh's &#145;memorable advice &hellip; of always keeping in our pocket a softback book so as not to miss a moment of good reading&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Aug 2003). Placed on the retired list in 1973, he was made KBE the same year, and subsequently was chairman of the Sea Cadet Association (1973&#150;83) and of the trust created to preserve the destroyer HMS <i>Cavalier</i> (1974&#150;88). He died on 30 July 2003 at the Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, Hampshire, and was survived by his three sons. He was buried at St Anne's Hill cemetery, Gosport, Hampshire.<br>
