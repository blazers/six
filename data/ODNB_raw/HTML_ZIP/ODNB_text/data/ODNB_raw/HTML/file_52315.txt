<span class="headword">&AElig;thelred</span>  (<em>d.</em> after 704), <span class="occ">king of the Mercians</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21829/', "Penda (d. 655)")</script>. He succeeded his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30093/', "Wulfhere")</script> as king of the Mercians, just after the latter's disastrous defeat by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37384/', "Ecgfrith")</script> of Northumbria <i>c</i>.674. This seriously diminished Mercian hegemony over the kingdoms of southern England and &AElig;thelred's first task was to restore the situation. Control in the south-east was established in 676 by a punitive raid into Kent, in which Rochester was sacked. &AElig;thelred was married to Ecgfrith's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20909/', "Osthryth")</script>, but this did not prevent him from inflicting a decisive defeat on his brother-in-law, at the battle of the Trent, in 679. He thereby recovered control of Lindsey, signalled by his patronage of the monastery at Bardney, whither Osthryth translated the remains of her uncle St Oswald. &AElig;thelred also asserted his lordship over the kings of the Hwicce and may have been instrumental in founding the monastery of St Peter's, Gloucester, about 681. It was perhaps his sister-in-law &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d, Osthryth's sister, who had, a little earlier, founded the short-lived monastery at Fladbury, in modern Worcestershire; the house was later in the hands of Queen Osthryth. &AElig;thelred also kept up Mercian pressure on the West Saxon kingdom; his nephew Berhtwald administered a territory on the borders of the Hwicce and the West Saxons, and was able to dispose of land in what is now Wiltshire  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1169).<br>
<br>Mercian relations with Northumbria remained poor. In 681, &#145;to flatter King Ecgfrith&#146;  (Eddius Stephanus, chap. 40), &AElig;thelred prevented Berhtwald from assisting the exiled Northumbrian Bishop Wilfrid, but matters changed after Ecgfrith's death in 685; when Wilfrid quarrelled with his successor, King Aldfrith (<i>c</i>.692), &AElig;thelred received him in Mercia and gave him the bishopric of the Middle Angles. Deteriorating relations with Northumbria are suggested by the murder in 697 of Queen Osthryth, &#145;by her own Mercian nobles&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 5.24); it may be that her personal household was implicated but no further details are given. She was buried at Bardney. Soon afterwards &AElig;thelred gave Fladbury to the bishopric of Worcester &#145;for the forgiveness of my sins and those of my late wife Osthryth&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 76). He may have married again, for a late source alleges that his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5000/', "Ceolred")</script> was not a child of Osthryth  (Macray, 73). In 704, however, he abdicated and retired as abbot to Bardney, whence he continued to advise his successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5802/', "Coenred")</script>, son of Wulfhere, and uphold the cause of Bishop Wilfrid. The date of his death is unknown; he was buried at Bardney, where both he and his murdered wife were venerated as saints.<br>
