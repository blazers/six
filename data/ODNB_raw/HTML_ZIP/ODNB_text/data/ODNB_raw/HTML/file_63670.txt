<span class="headword">Upton,  Clotworthy</span>  (1665&#150;1725), <span class="occ">politician and religious activist</span>, was born on 6 January 1665, the fourth but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28008/', "Arthur Upton (1633&#150;1706)")</script>, landowner and politician, of Castle Upton, Templepatrick, co. Antrim, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1643, <i>d</i>. in or after 1717), daughter of Michael Beresford of Coleraine, co. Londonderry. The first Upton to arrive in Ireland had been Henry, a captain in Essex's army in 1598, who had married into the planter family of the Clotworthys, viscounts Massereene. Although of English descent, the Uptons had by the late seventeenth century become strict Presbyterians. In 1689 Arthur Upton was active in organizing local resistance to James II, while Clotworthy raised a troop and joined King William at the siege of Limerick, where he fell into the hands of the Jacobites and was for a time held prisoner. Prior to the rising of 1688 he had been entered at the Middle Temple, and he may have been the Mr Upton who was admitted in 1702 to the King's Inns in Dublin, although there is no record of his ever having practised law.<br>
<br>Elected to the Irish parliament in 1695 for the borough of Newtownards, Upton succeeded his father in 1703 as MP for co. Antrim. In the Irish House of Commons he was always ready to speak in defence of his fellow Presbyterians. He strongly opposed the imposition of the sacramental test in 1704 and subsequently fought a lone battle for its repeal, so that he came to be recognized as &#145;the chief lay Dissenter in Ireland&#146;  (Bishop John Evans to Archbishop William Wake, 30 April 1717, Christ Church, Oxford, Wake MS 12). In 1715 he was sent to England by the general synod to solicit the repeal of the test, but returned empty-handed. A second mission in 1717, with toleration the objective, was similarly unsuccessful. But Upton badgered his friends in England, and in 1719 secured a promise from Lord Sunderland to instruct the new viceroy, the duke of Bolton, to push for repeal of the test. However, Upton could only watch helplessly as first the proposed repeal was abandoned, then ministerial proposals for a toleration bill were undermined by the Irish parliamentary opposition. The outcome, a limited toleration and a partial retrospective indemnity over the test, was bitterly disappointing.<br>
<br>In his religion Upton was staunchly orthodox, and he may have been responsible for the appointment as minister for Templepatrick of the arch-conservative William Livingston. When conflict broke out within the general synod on the issue of subscription to the Westminster confession, Upton weighed in on the subscribing side. In 1722 he brought before the synod a &#145;charge&#146; against the non-subscribers, claiming that one of their pamphlets proved them guilty of &#145;holding a principle that opens a door for letting in error and heresy&#146;  (Wodrow Letters Quarto 20, fol. 305). This affair rumbled on for two years and came to an unsatisfactory conclusion in 1724 when Upton was unable to attend the synod to prosecute his accusations, detained in Dublin on what was perhaps a diplomatic pretext.<br>
<br>Upton was married three times, and each marriage was tragically brief: in 1692 to Lady Mary Boyle (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of Roger Boyle, second earl of Orrery, and Mary Sackville; in 1706 to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1707), daughter of William Stewart of Killymoon, co. Tyrone; and finally, about November 1712, to Jane (<i>d</i>. 1713), daughter of John Ormsby of Athlacca, co. Limerick, who, before she died, gave birth to his only child, a daughter, Jane. He died at his home, Castle Upton, on 3 September 1725, after a short illness, when an infection in his leg became gangrenous. According to Livingston, he was &#145;lamented by men of all distinctions. The Tories and Jacobites say he was a fair and generous adversary, and the papists express a great concern for him, for &hellip; he protected them from some severities in the House of Commons&#146;  (Witherow, 207&#150;8). He was succeeded at Castle Upton by his brother John, an army officer and a conformist, and father of the first Baron Templetown. By a settlement made shortly before his death Clotworthy Upton left a fortune of &pound;6000 p.a. to his daughter, who after her marriage was created <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Langford. Livingston, and his successors in the Presbyterian ministry of Templepatrick, received a legacy of &pound;8 per annum.<br>
