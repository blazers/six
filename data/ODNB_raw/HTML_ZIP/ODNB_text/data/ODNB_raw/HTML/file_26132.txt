<span class="headword">Spencer,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">college head and Hebraist</span>, was baptized in Boughton under Bleane, Kent, on 31 October 1630, possibly the son of Adam Spencer, fellmonger. He became a king's scholar at King's School, Canterbury. From the age of fourteen he lived mainly in or near Cambridge. Spencer was admitted as a Parker scholar of Corpus on 25 March 1645 and graduated BA in 1648/9, MA in 1652, BD in 1659, and DD in 1665. He was chosen fellow of the college (1655) and master (3 August 1667), and was vice-chancellor of the university in 1673&#150;4. As a young fellow he served the Cambridge parishes of St Giles and St Bene't where he was vicar from 1657 to 1662. Like other masters before him, he was also rector of the college living of Landbeach, near Cambridge (1667&#150;83), and dean of Ely (from 1677); he was also archdeacon of Sudbury, in the Norwich diocese, from 1667.<br>
<br>Spencer married Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1674), daughter of Isaac Puller of Hertford and sister of Timothy Puller, the author of <span class="italic">The Moderation of the Church of England</span>. Their children, Elizabeth and John, were baptized on 25 March 1672 and 19 December 1673 respectively. Hannah Spencer was buried in St Bene't's chancel on 21 April 1674. Elizabeth was buried next to her mother on 9 December 1688. Spencer's nephew William Spencer, his curate and successor at Landbeach, also died in 1688.<br>
<br>Wainscoting attributed to the beginning of Spencer's mastership can be seen in the old master's lodge. The years when he lived there as a widower with his daughter, before her untimely death, form the theme of a college ghost story current by the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Benefaction and writing characterized the last decade of Spencer's life. In 1683&#150;5 he issued at Cambridge the first edition of his great work <span class="italic">De legibus Hebraeorum ritualibus et earum rationibus</span>, comprising three books &#145;on the ritual laws of the Hebrews, and the reasons for them&#146;. In 1687 he settled the valuable Elmington estate on Corpus, and gave books to the college library. In 1691&#150;2 he made an entirely new fourth book of <span class="italic">De legibus</span> ready for printing, together with revisions of the earlier books. His will of 20 April 1693 details further benefactions to the college, the cathedral (including the singing men and vergers), the three parishes which he had served, the poor of Ely, relations, and servants. The marble font which this will directed to be made for the cathedral is now in Prickwillow parish church. Spencer died on 27 May 1693, and was buried in Corpus Christi College chapel, where a black marble floor stone bears his epitaph.<br>
<br>Spencer fully accepted the Restoration settlement, but was a friend and benefactor of dissenters. In outlook he resembled his close friend and executor Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury. Moreover, the Socinian writer Samuel Crell claimed, probably rightly, that Spencer received him when he visited Cambridge. Suspicion of Spencer's latitudinarianism as doctrinally lax will then have sharpened criticism of his writings.<br>
<br>W. Robertson Smith called Spencer &#145;one of the greatest English theologians &hellip; whose Latin work on the ritual laws of the Hebrews may justly be said to have laid the foundations of the science of Comparative Religion&#146;. Spencer urged that on investigation these laws and customs could be seen in every case to derive from the surrounding paganism, especially that of Egypt. This bold historical conclusion was invaluable theologically, Spencer argued, for even the greatest writers who had contended for the rationality of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> law&#151;Spencer instanced Maimonides among the Jews and Aquinas among the Christians&#151;had judged the reasons for many particular laws to be irrecoverable. Now, however, Spencer claimed, the ritual laws could be fully understood as a divine concession to human frailty, and a kind of inoculation against paganism. Spencer noted that such divine concession to ward off idolatry was envisaged by church fathers, including Eusebius, and in the Jewish tradition by Maimonides. He thus integrated his philological and historical work with an argument for the concord of scripture and reason.<br>
<br>Spencer's argument was not unparalleled in his time on either the historical side, by John Marsham, or the theological, by Edward Stillingfleet; but he united the two with unrivalled learning and insight, and with the cumulative force of a series of detailed inquiries into ancient religion. He had prepared the way by <span class="italic">Dissertatio de Urim et Thummim</span> (1669), which elicited the first of many continental and British criticisms of his argument. <span class="italic">De legibus</span> was twice reprinted (The Hague, 1686; Leipzig, 1705). The unpublished fourth book was eagerly awaited after Spencer's death  (letter of Newton to Otto Mencke, 22 Nov 1693, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, no. 416). Tenison's efforts to issue it were in vain, but he himself left money to provide for editorial work. The second edition, now including the fourth book (ed. L. Chappelow, Cambridge, 1727, with portrait), was also twice reprinted (T&uuml;bingen, 1732; Venice, in parts, 1757&#150;67).<br>
