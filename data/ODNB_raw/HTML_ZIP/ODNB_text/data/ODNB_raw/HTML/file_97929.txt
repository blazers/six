<span class="headword">Mawson,  Edward Prentice</span>  (1885&#150;1954), <span class="occ">landscape architect</span>, was born in Ambleside, Westmorland, in the Lake District on 16 July 1885, the eldest of the nine children (four boys and five girls) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37748/', "Thomas Hayton Mawson (1861&#150;1933)")</script>, landscape architect, and his wife, Anna (<i>b</i>. 1862/3), daughter of Edward Prentice, a surgeon from North Walsham. He attended the grammar school in Windermere, and it was accepted that he would eventually take charge of the family firm of landscape architects. His father ensured that he received qualifications in architecture, as there were no schools for landscape architects at the time, and a good working knowledge of plants and design from the Lakeland Nursery, Windermere, established by his uncles, Robert and Isaac Mawson. He went to the Architectural Association School in London, and then to the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he adopted the formal style of design favoured by many Edwardian architects and garden makers.<br>
<br>After articles served with a London firm of architects Mawson joined his father as a partner in 1910; by now the firm was established in Lancaster and had an office in London. He won the RIBA's Soane medallion in the same year. He was responsible for drawing up plans for two prestigious commissions awarded to his father in 1908, the Peace Palace garden at The Hague, and the garden and its tower for Queen Alexandra for her seaside house of Hvid&ouml;re in Copenhagen. On 9 April 1913 he married Hilda (<i>b</i>. 1885/6), daughter of Thomas Bowhill, boot manufacturer, of Norwich. They moved to Hest Bank, north of Lancaster, and had two sons and a daughter, born in 1917, 1920, and 1925.<br>
<br>In the early twentieth century Mawson and his brother John accompanied their father to North America to gain experience of town planning. <i>En route</i> to Canada in 1913 Thomas Mawson received an invitation to design the palace gardens in Athens for the king of Greece, and Edward was dispatched to Athens where he prepared these designs and others in Greece. Preliminary studies were submitted in July 1914, though the outbreak of the First World War meant that the plans were not carried out. Unfit for military service, Edward and John worked on commissions with their father that included the redesigning of the town of Salonika, which had been damaged by fire in 1917, and the reconstruction of villages to the war-damaged north. Political infighting and financial difficulties again prevented the completion of this commission, though Edward was awarded the order of King George for his work in Greece, and he was called back again in the 1930s.<br>
<br>In Silverdale, Lancashire, Mawson worked on Hazelwood Hall and its garden in 1916 and returned to Grey Walls in 1925. He designed the great hillside park and shelters at Rivington, north-west of Bolton, for Lord Leverhulme, and assisted his father in making The Hill garden, Hampstead, for the same client. Father and son worked together at Boveridge Park, near Cranborne in Dorset, for Charles W. Gordon in 1920, and for W. Gilchrist Macbeth at Dunira in Perthshire in the same year, creating singularly beautiful landscapes. After his father was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1923 Edward Mawson was effectively in control of the family firm, his brother John Mawson moving to New Zealand as director of town planning for New Zealand in 1928.<br>
<br>Between the wars more contracts were to be found in the public sector than for private clients, and Mawson designed many public parks, including Stanley Park in Blackpool from 1922 to 1926. This had a formal core of Italian gardens overlooked by an art deco social centre, a bandstand, and a boating pool, all surrounded by football and cricket pitches, bowling greens, and tennis courts. He designed a park with pavilion and a pergola in a formal water garden at Weston-super-Mare from 1923, and commissions for town centre improvements and seafront garden developments followed at Southend-on-Sea, Lytham St Annes, Hastings, and Bridlington. Plymouth Park, which opened in 1931, marked a current change in taste, concentrating on sports provision more than floral adornment. In the mid-1930s the firm designed popular outdoor facilities such as Droitwich Spa and Brine Baths in Worcestershire and Ruislip Lido in Middlesex with flower beds and shrubs; even Squires Gate holiday camp in Blackpool (later Pontins) had its formal gardens.<br>
<br>Mawson's partners were Gordon H. Farrow, an associate of the Institute of Landscape Architects and a superb draughtsman whose illustrations provided the equivalent of the glossy brochure, and Thomas Prentice Mawson, Edward's younger son. They worked on a wide range of landscape commissions such as Mayesbrook Park in Barking, campsites in co. Antrim and Normandy, private garden creation and reconstruction, and large-scale town planning schemes ranging from London county council's St Helier estate in 1934 to the Ulster garden villages from 1947.<br>
<br>A good public speaker and an honorary lecturer in landscape design at Reading University, Mawson assisted his father in the writing of the fifth edition of <span class="italic">The Art and Craft of Garden Making</span> of 1926, and wrote <span class="italic">Amounderness</span>, a planning report on the Fylde, in 1937. He was a member of the Town Planning Institute from 1919 and of the Institute of Structural Engineers from 1921, a fellow and founder member of the Institute of Landscape Architects, acting president after his father's death in 1933, and president from 1936 to 1937. He died suddenly of coronary thrombosis at 4 Lonsdale Road, Hest Bank, Lancaster, on 22 December 1954, and was cremated in Blackpool. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
