<span class="headword">Peek, Sir  Cuthbert Edgar</span>, second baronet  (1855&#150;1901), <span class="occ">astronomer and meteorologist</span>, born at Wimbledon, Surrey, on 30 January 1855, was the only child of Sir Henry William Peek (1825&#150;1898), first baronet (created 1874), of Wimbledon House, Wimbledon, a partner in the firm of Messrs Peek Brothers &amp; Co., colonial merchants, of East Cheap, and MP for East Surrey from 1868 to 1884. His mother was Margaret Maria (1828&#150;1884), the second daughter of the haberdasher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56365/', "William Edgar")</script> of Eagle House, Clapham Common. He was educated at Eton College and entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1876; he graduated BA in 1879 and proceeded MA in 1884. After leaving Cambridge he went through a course of astronomy and surveying, and put his knowledge to practical use in two journeys, made in 1881, into unfrequented parts of Iceland, where he took regular observations of latitude and longitude and dip of the magnetic needle. On his return he set up a small observatory in the grounds of his father's house at Wimbledon, where he observed with a 3 inch equatorial. In 1882 Peek spent six weeks at Jimbour, Queensland, to observe the transit of Venus across the sun's disc in December of that year. With his principal instrument, an equatorially mounted telescope of 6.4 inches by Merz, he observed, in the days preceding the transit, double stars and star clusters. He paid special attention to the nebula in the constellation of Argus, one of the wonders of the southern sky, which he described in a memoir. Observations of the transit, however, were prevented by cloud. Peek travelled extensively in Australia and New Zealand, and brought back to England many items to add to a museum created by his father at Rousdon, Devon.<br>
<br>On 3 January 1884 Peek married Augusta Louisa, the eldest daughter of William Brodrick, eighth Viscount Midleton.<br>
<br>In 1883 he had established, on his father's estate at Rousdon, a meteorological station of the second order, and in 1884 he set up there an astronomical observatory to contain the Merz telescope and a transit instrument with other accessories. Assisted by Charles Grover, he began a systematic observation of the variation of brightness of long-period variable stars, by Argelander's method, and following the same plan as the Harvard College observatory. Annual reports were sent to the Royal Astronomical Society, which Peek joined on 11 January 1884, and short sets of observations were occasionally published in pamphlet form. The complete series of the observations of twenty-two stars extending over sixteen years was collected at Peek's request by Professor Herbert Hall Turner of Oxford and published by him after Peek's death in the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society</span>. The introduction to the volume contains a section written by Peek in 1896 explaining his astronomical methods. The regular observations of his meteorological instruments were also collected and published in annual volumes.<br>
<br>Peek succeeded to the baronetcy and to the estates that his father had bought in Surrey and Devon on the latter's death on 26 August 1898. He was elected FSA on 6 March 1890, was honorary secretary of the Anthropological Society, and often served on the council or as a vice-president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1884 until his death. He endowed the Royal Geographical Society, of whose council he was a member, with a medal for the advancement of geographical knowledge. Interested in shooting, he presented a challenge cup and an annual prize to be shot for by members of the Cambridge University volunteer corps. He had been staying at Brighton for six months when he died, at 9 Eastern Terrace, Kemp Town, on 6 July 1901 of a brain tumour. He was buried at Rousdon. He was survived by his wife and their two sons and four daughters; his elder son, Wilfrid (1884&#150;1927), succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
