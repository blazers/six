</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (1582&#150;1650), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was born at Aberconwy, about 25 March 1582, and baptized in the parish church of St Mary's, Conwy, on 27 March, the younger son of Edmund Williams (<i>d</i>. 1601) of Conwy and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1585), daughter of Owen Wynn of Eglwys-bach. Both parents were members of well-established Caernarvonshire gentry families, his father descended from the houses of Cochwillan and Penrhyn, and his mother from the cousinage around the Wynns of Gwydir, in the Conwy valley.<h2>
<a name="Earlypromise15981612"></a>Early promise, 1598&#150;1612</h2>Williams was sent to school at Ruthin, where he caught the eye of Richard Vaughan, bishop of Chester, a distant relative, before entering the bishop's college, St John's, Cambridge, in 1598. He owed more, however, to his godfather Sir John Wynn of Gwydir, who persuaded Edmund Williams, a man of moderate substance but choleric disposition, to let John take his education further. Wynn subsequently interested himself in his material welfare, something he did only sparingly for his own sons. A cousin, Owen Gwynn, was already a fellow of St John's, but Wynn clearly appreciated Williams's unusual abilities, including a talent for languages which in time brought him familiarity with nine of them. After graduating BA in 1601, the year his father died, Williams became a fellow of St John's on 14 April 1603; he took his MA, and entered holy orders as a Calvinist with liberal inclinations in 1605.<br>
<br>On 17 October 1605 Williams was instituted to the modestly endowed crown living of Honington in Suffolk, which he assured his godfather &#145;will do well, being joyned to my place in Cambridge&#146;  (Ballinger, no. 369), suggesting that James I too had quickly become aware of his high ability and limited finances. He spent some time each year with Vaughan during the latter's period as bishop of London (1604&#150;7), and through him met John Lumley, Lord Lumley, a kinsman by marriage and Prince Henry's tutor and benefactor; he proved generous with both books and money until his death in April 1609 revived Williams's worries about his uncertain means. However, Richard Clayton, the elderly master of St John's, increasingly employed him about college business, in the course of which he impressed Archbishop Richard Bancroft sufficiently to be made archdeacon of Cardigan in 1610, and won the approval of Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, the chancellor of the university. As junior proctor Williams's contribution to the disputations which entertained the duke of W&uuml;rttemberg came to the king's ears, and lively preaching at St Mary's, Cambridge, led to an invitation to perform at Newmarket in November 1611 in the presence of James and Prince Henry; Williams afterwards remarked that his sermon brought them &#145;some extraordinary contentment&#146;  (Dew Roberts, 18). Thus prompted, lord chancellor Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere, invited him to become another of his carefully chosen band of household chaplains, while in 1612 James granted him the living of Grafton Underwood, Northamptonshire, on the surrender of Honington. Ellesmere's chief secretary, John Panton, was one of John Williams's numerous cousins and a few years later was to nominate him as guardian to his children, leaving him &#145;a great Wind-fall&#146; in his will  (Hacket, 1.35).<br>
<br>Before he joined Ellesmere, in 1611&#150;12 Williams insisted on serving his term as the university's senior proctor, allowing himself a further opportunity to emphasize his capabilities. On the death of Salisbury he played a leading role in pacifying James's anger at the premature nomination of Prince Henry as his successor in the chancellorship and smoothed the way for the earl of Northampton to take the position instead. On a smaller scale, in May 1612 he adroitly managed Owen Gwynn's election as master of St John's in succession to Clayton, thereby improving the chances of a fellowship there for Robin Wynn, one of Sir John's younger sons. In May 1613 he also gave himself the leading role in St John's contribution to the celebrations to mark the visit to Cambridge of Prince Charles and the elector palatine, and hurried to take his BD in order to participate in the theological disputations that took place simultaneously. He acquitted himself so well in his encounter with the formidable Dr Samuel Collins&#151;&#145;the one was the buckler, the other the sword of that learned exercise&#146;, according to John Hacket&#151;that James Montagu, dean of the Chapel Royal and bishop of Bath and Wells, was added to his patrons  (Hacket, 1.26).<h2>
<a name="Prefermentandpatrons16121620"></a>Preferment and patrons, 1612&#150;1620</h2>Williams was already beginning to climb the ladder of ecclesiastical preferment. In July 1612 he was elected to a prebend of Hereford Cathedral, and his association with Lincoln Cathedral began shortly afterwards. On 10 October 1613, during the interval before Richard Neile succeeded William Barlow as bishop of Lincoln, Williams was granted the prebend of Lufford, subsequently exchanging it for Asgarby; on 29 December he was appointed precentor, with the prebend of Kelsey attached to the office. Probably at Ellesmere's instigation, Neile granted him the rectory of Walgrave in 1614, to be held in conjunction with Grafton Underwood, and in June 1616 Bishop Thomas Dove instituted him as first prebendary of Peterborough Cathedral. In all, Ellesmere helped him to five livings but when he died, in 1617, Williams gracefully declined to continue as household chaplain under the new lord chancellor, and Francis Bacon amiably responded by appointing him a JP and member of the quorum for Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Williams made an awkward start to his new role of JP, however, making little attempt in 1618 to settle an ill-concealed difference of opinion with the senior JP in the neighbourhood, Sir Edward Montagu, Bishop Montagu's godly eldest brother, over the meaning and intent of certain passages in King James's recently issued <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> encouraging approved forms of recreation on Sundays after divine worship. Instead Williams, after some leaning on witnesses at Grafton Underwood, retired to the court where his superior connections succeeded in deflecting the protests of the Sabbatarian Montagu and another brother, Henry Montagu, chief justice of king's bench. At Grafton, where he was scarcely known, Williams had allegedly justified his brash behaviour by asking his parishioners, &#145;Am I not Justice of the peace and Justice of the Quorum, Doctor and parson of the town?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buccleuch MSS</span>, 3.208). He had yet to attend quarter sessions and, Edward Montagu believed, had still to take the oath of office. It was to be characteristic of Williams's interventions in local government that they tended to focus on himself at least as much as on the problems in front of him and, even when he had a sound point to make, might be compromised by at least a hint of irresponsibility.<br>
<br>In 1617, as in 1611, Williams showed an inclination to reserve his position in dealing with patrons other than the crown during the early years of his advance. Williams had his eyes on a loftier course. His place at court was in no jeopardy after Ellesmere's death, as James Montagu had him made a royal chaplain and at the same time convinced the king that, rather than accompanying him to Scotland, Williams might be more usefully employed entertaining the archbishop of Spalato at Cambridge by an able defence of his thesis for a doctorate of divinity. By 1618 Williams had had bestowed on him at least seven parochial livings, the prebends of three cathedrals, the archdeaconry of Cardigan, and a royal chaplaincy; yet, encouraged by the quality of his patronage, he remained acquisitive. In September 1619 James's favour secured for him the deanship of Salisbury despite the marquess of Buckingham's support for a rival candidate, and set in train Williams's advance to the centre of the political stage.<br>
<br>Williams had not been at Salisbury more than six months when on 11 March 1620 Martin Fotherby, the bishop, died. The next day Williams, already aware that the dean of Westminster, Robert Townson, was to be Fotherby's successor, applied to Buckingham for the Westminster deanery, the modesty of his phrasing not entirely concealing the precipitate manner of his approach or his determination to succeed. In the process Robert Cecil's old chaplain, Dr John Bowle, who had the kind of prior claim which he professed to be anxious not to prejudice, was brushed aside. Williams was fortunate that James had recently entrusted him with bringing into the Church of England Buckingham's future wife, Lady Katherine Manners (whose father, the earl of Rutland, he had visited on journeys to Lincoln), for he had not been in the habit of paying court to the favourite, and had only done so recently when bluntly advised by the king to remedy the omission. It was a timely warning, as Buckingham happened to be high steward of Westminster. Williams explained to the favourite that as he was &#145;unmarried, and inclining so to continue &hellip; [he considered] that Westminster is fitter by much [than Salisbury] for that disposition&#146;. He made no mention of the injury in his youth which had, according to his chaplain Hacket, rendered him &#145;chast perforce&#146;  (Hacket, 1.8). Lest his case seemed thin, he concluded his letter by declaring himself &#145;Your honours poor Beadsman already ever bound&#146;, and set about cultivating Buckingham's mother. He also summoned Hacket from Cambridge so that he could draw on his experience, while a scholar at Westminster, of the exemplary way in which Lancelot Andrewes had run the school and educated its pupils. His collation did not take place until 10 July, which may indicate that others were seriously considered, but John Chamberlain noted as early as 20 March that &#145;one Williams&#146; was to succeed Townson at Westminster  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.296). Like Sir Edward Montagu, Chamberlain was still coming to terms with his rapid rise. Williams himself did not forget his roots, finding time to preach in Gwydir chapel shortly after Easter, on 24 April 1621.<br>
<br>The deanery of Westminster was to become a cherished prize. It allowed Williams a close relationship with the court, entertaining ambassadors and others on James's behalf with banquets and the abbey's music, and it encouraged an attachment to parliament where later, as bishop of Lincoln, he was stoutly to maintain his right to sit in the Lords. As dean he presided over an influential school and had ready access to a celebrated pulpit. In the years ahead the deanery provided a fitting base for him while in high office, and in darker days allowed him a continuing presence at Westminster, sustaining the hope that he might recover his political fortunes. In the later 1620s and early 1630s he was still casting a shadow which could not be entirely ignored, even though, as George Garrard later remarked, he would have lived more easily had he agreed to resign on one of the several occasions he was asked to do so.<h2>
<a name="Anepiscopallordkeeper16211625"></a>An episcopal lord keeper, 1621&#150;1625</h2>In the summer of 1621 Williams became the first clerical lord keeper since Archbishop Nicholas Heath in 1558. The manner of his appointment was a further demonstration of his ability to react quickly to the needs of the moment. James I was known to be anxious to redefine the relationship between the courts of common law and of equity, in order to emphasize the paramount role of chancery as the court in which God's law and the king's conscience were most fittingly expressed, and had toyed with the idea of a clerical lord keeper before appointing Bacon. His determination grew in 1621 when, alongside their attacks on Bacon, the Commons embarked on a sweeping review of the jurisdiction and processes of chancery. What James needed was an authoritative statement of his own position, and Williams promptly supplied one. Implicit in his paper was the assumption that its author was the man to carry out its proposals. James was convinced; but although he formally announced Williams's appointment as lord keeper on 15 June 1621, and had him sworn privy councillor three days later, the seal was not delivered to him until 10 July. In the interim James had to dismiss an approach from Prince Charles on behalf of his chancellor, Sir Henry Hobart, chief justice of common pleas, and turn aside Buckingham's pleas for first Lionel Cranfield, and then Sir James Ley. He had also to counter privy councillors' objections to Williams's youth and inexperience. As a consequence the new lord keeper was unavoidably cast as James I's man.<br>
<br>Although to the Wynns he had achieved enough for them to &#145;daunt the arrogance of their enemies&#146;  (Ballinger, no. 966), Williams still had ambition unfulfilled. The death on 30 March of John King, bishop of London, had excited his interest. As early as 2 March young William Wynn, now in Williams's service, had heard that his cousin aimed to succeed King, and a letter from Williams to Buckingham of about that date leaves no doubt that it was so. By June he was pleading that, as a cleric intended for high office in the state, it was appropriate that he should enjoy similar status in the church. This time, however, he presumed too much on the king's indulgence. Instead of the diocese of London, which went to George Montaigne, he found himself chosen by James on 3 August as Montaigne's successor to the vast and unwieldy see of Lincoln, with a dilapidated palace at Buckden in Huntingdonshire; worse, he was now in danger of having no London base which he considered suitable. He had to scramble to recover the deanery of Westminster, intended for the dean of Gloucester, William Laud, who had been a prebendary since January 1621, and did not scruple to disappoint his own kinsman, Owen Gwynn, in the process. He was formally confirmed in the deanery by a patent of 14 August, having secured it by prevailing on John Bowle to &#145;most willingly give way to &hellip; [his] retayninge thereof&#146;, and by persuading the king and prince to approve Laud's belated elevation to the bench of bishops by nominating him to the diocese of St David's  (<span class="italic">Fortescue Papers</span>, 158). St David's had recently been offered to Gwynn, but he had been slow to accept it and it was technically still vacant.<br>
<br>Wrong-footed, Williams had rallied, but he had done so awkwardly, without always calculating the consequences of his dealings. One of them had long-term significance. Laud, now a Welsh bishop unlike the Welshman Williams, was in future to be numbered among the prince of Wales's higher clergy, in whom Charles took a close interest. He could thus look with new expectancy towards the future, particularly when the prince became king. On the other hand Williams, despite having got back the deanery of Westminster, was in due course obliged by the turn of events to &#145;shut himself fast [in it] with as strong Bars and Bolts as the Law could make; Else&#146;, as Hacket observed afterwards, &#145;&hellip; he had been sure to be thrust out of Doors in a storm, when he had most need of a Covering&#146;  (Hacket, 1.62). Gwynn, meanwhile, was consoled that November with &#145;the poore archdeaconry of Huntingdon&#146; worth no more than &pound;30 a year which, Williams confessed to Buckingham's secretary, John Packer, he really ought to improve  (<span class="italic">Fortescue Papers</span>, 168, 170). Some months earlier, he had dealt more subtly with another St John's man, Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton, an old friend in political disgrace in the parliament of 1621, skilfully making peace with James and, as one in holy orders, warning Buckingham on 2 August of the perils of obduracy in a good cause: &#145;Of all actions forget not those of mercy and Goodnesse, wherein men draw nighest to God himself&#146;  (Stopes, 413).<br>
<br>One of Williams's first duties as lord keeper was to preside over the House of Lords during its second sitting in 1621, where he confidently set out the reasons for their meeting and rehearsed the state of foreign affairs. He sought to exercise a moderating influence, sticking close to James's own policy where he could, at times modifying it with James's consent to the taste of parliament. Like Ellesmere, he looked to develop a network of contacts in both houses, according to Hacket customarily carrying a list of MPs with him, and having &#145;Spies &hellip; in many private conferences&#146;  (Hacket, 1.205, 2.80). More generally, though, Williams's keepership soon had an air of impermanence about it, arising from the various doubts in court and council about his appointment, and reflected in the conditions of his tenure. His term was to be a three-year one, with a review half-way through, and in difficult matters he was to be assisted in the court of chancery by senior common-law judges. Williams later maintained he had proposed these terms to James in acknowledgement of his inexperience but, however arrived at, they gave the impression that he was on trial. Williams insisted that after three years he would resign, and James would then offer him a better see than Lincoln, perhaps York as Archbishop Toby Matthew came to believe; but it was soon rumoured that a man of proven competence, such as Henry Montagu, Viscount Mandeville, might be put in over his head as lord chancellor.<br>
<br>Williams, however, never lacked confidence in his own ability and judgement. On taking office he appointed as his secretary Richard Oakley, James Whitelocke's promising but raw former clerk, still to be called to the bar, and within weeks, he was giving Southampton advice based on his close reading of Star Chamber precedents. The coaching in the law which Ellesmere and Sir Henry Finch had provided may have been limited, but he was clearly at ease with legal process, and quickly developed an appreciation of the political context within which he was working. Buckingham seems to have found him an uncomfortable correspondent, too knowing by half. Instructed by James on 1 September 1621, less than two months into office, to seal the earl of Arundel's patent as earl marshal and to confirm his pension of &pound;2000 a year, Williams raised with Buckingham a series of questions about the patent's sweeping definition of the earl's authority and, while confirming the pension, made it plain it would have been politic to have delayed it until parliament was over. His opening speech in chancery, however, faithfully reflected the king's intentions in appointing a churchman to the keepership, and he soon earned a reputation for dispatching cases with an expedition not seen in many years. In court he took the initiative. Although he had common-law judges with him, in later days regularly including his old friend Whitelocke, he was quick to assert himself, often speaking without consulting them. Sometimes justice was rougher than it might have been and during the 1621 parliament Sir John Bourchier complained about the indecent haste with which Williams had disposed of his business in chancery, but found the Lords protective of the new lord keeper. Lionel Cranfield took up the charge at court in September 1622, accusing Williams of racing through business in the interests of profit from process. James eventually dismissed the accusation, but Williams felt obliged to provide Buckingham with a detailed summary of his just and economical proceedings. He also offered an alternative explanation for his busyness: he had inherited a large backlog from Bacon but since he needed to sleep no more than three or four hours a night, and was accustomed to working from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. or later, he had managed to clear it without delay. A search of the chancery registry revealed that by November 1622 he had produced 1600 court orders, including more final orders than Ellesmere had managed during his entire service. Self-effacingly he informed the favourite: &#145;I am one of those that labour in his Majesties Cole-mines under the earth and out of sight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cabala</span>, 74), but William Wynn noticed that his eyes had become rheumy and his face swollen, and that he had taken to walking with a staff, as lack of exercise had stiffened his right thigh. However, in case his father, Sir John Wynn, grew alarmed at the collapse of his investment, he assured him that Williams was now out of danger.<br>
<br>Even so Williams's attendance at routine meetings of the privy council, the only ones for which early Stuart evidence survives, was noticeably less frequent than that of Ellesmere and Bacon before him and Thomas Coventry afterwards. Where they managed to attend three meetings in every four, Williams could do no better than one in two over a relatively limited period. He was never wholly comfortable at the council table in the company of several of those who doubted him, and seems to have preferred to go his own way rather than take heed of the collective will. He did not engender trust. On 12 October 1622, within days of the settlement of his dispute with Cranfield, he was in danger of overreacting when he found that in his absence the council had sensibly decided to advise James, away at Newmarket, not to consider any more Irish suits until Sir William Jones, Sir Nathaniel Rich, and the rest of the English commissioners made their imminently expected return from Ireland. As he later reported to Buckingham:<blockquote>Against this &hellip; I spake first to the Prince privately (who allowed of my reasons), then (when the President [of the council, Henry Montagu, Viscount Mandeville] would not mend it) at the Table openly, that I did utterly dislike we should tutour his Majesty how to grant suits, especially in Letters that are to remain upon record.</blockquote>Told by Archbishop George Abbot and Arundel that there were precedents aplenty, he retorted they had shallow roots and were all from James's reign. He wished &#145;them &hellip; all torn out of the book and cast into the fire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cabala</span>, 75). He reminded Buckingham this was the third time he had protested against the council limiting the king, other than by word of mouth, but he does not seem to have paused to wonder why James, who was not unversed in council practices, had for so long neglected to make any protest of his own.<br>
<br>Four months later, however, Williams himself had the temerity to delay the publication of the proclamation of February 1623 to the king's subjects for their relief against a wide range of public grievances of a kind raised in the recent parliament, which James was eagerly awaiting, and he came dangerously close to teaching the king his business. He recommended trebling the number of commissioners named from five to fifteen by adding six peers and four bishops (including Abbot &#145;unless your Majesty &hellip; have some reasons for the omission&#146;), all of whom were in touch with popular sentiments but who, in 1621 had &#145;kept themselves within the compass of Duty and due Respect to your Majesty&#146; and so might serve as &#145;witnesses of your Majesties justice and good government against the next ensuing Parliament&#146;  (Hacket, 1.109). His thinking was sound enough but he conveyed it to James only on 23 February after secretary of state Sir Edward Conway had written to Mandeville from Royston enquiring on the king's behalf about the delay. Although Hacket believed otherwise, James promptly had the proclamation published in its original form, bearing its intended date (14 February 1623), even though now almost a fortnight late. One of Williams's suggestions as an additional commissioner had been his friend John Holles, Lord Houghton, once comptroller of Prince Henry's household and a caustic observer of contemporary politics, now anxious both to get back into public service and to acquire an earldom. After Holles had been denied the first, Williams persuaded Buckingham that it would be prudent to accommodate his social ambitions and, for a price, secured for Holles the earldom of Clare, traditionally reserved for princes of the blood royal.<br>
<br>Williams's fellow councillors had not been slow to act on their mistrust of the newcomer, however. They too were busy on 12 October 1622, taking away from him the lord keeper's traditional function of appointing JPs and reserving it to themselves. They had in mind the need for tighter internal security, particularly after the recent ill-defined &#145;connivance&#146; for English Catholics prior to a possible Spanish match for the prince, which the assize judges had been attempting to carry out under Williams's direction. Afterwards he chose to make light to Buckingham of what he thought was a futile gesture, although one in which he may have suspected the favourite had had a hand: it was &#145;to no purpose in the world, nor service to his Majestie&#146;, even though that same day, in similar vein, James had agreed to take responsibility from the lord lieutenants for nominating deputies  (<span class="italic">Cabala</span>, 76). Williams's own early, rather whimsical, circular letters to the counties, moreover, had usually ended with a clear threat that he would remove idle JPs, and London newsletters in January 1622 had noted that a culling of JPs was supposed to be afoot, although it seems to have left no trace.<br>
<br>Perhaps crucially for his prospects, Williams was never enthusiastic about Charles and Buckingham's expedition to Madrid in 1623, although he found himself, in much the same way as other Hispanophiles, awkwardly placed politically after the collapse of the marriage negotiations. In the parliament of 1624 he resisted any equation between political preferences for Spain and the endorsement of popery at home. As lord keeper he was ready to see the penal laws strictly applied but like James he remained anxious not to break ties with Spain altogether. Williams came to believe that it was his foot-dragging in consultations during the 1624 parliament about ending the treaties with Spain, &#145;which the Duke made the Bishop's sin against the Holy Ghost&#146;, that finally undermined him  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/8/63). Even though the pull of the reversionary interest must have been apparent, the evident antipathy between him and Buckingham helped to confirm Williams in his faithfulness to James's preferences. His association with James was to be emphasized as the reign ended. On his deathbed James called for Bishop Lancelot Andrews to perform the last rites, but as he was ill Williams deputized. He also preached the king's funeral sermon, over two hours, late in a disordered day. Published as <span class="italic">Great Britain's Salomon</span> (1625), it was generally agreed to have done justice to his old master without entirely overlooking his successor.<br>
<br>During the few months he remained lord keeper under Charles, Williams rarely put a foot right. Buckingham's nervousness at Williams's capacity for intrigue increased as he realized how much the bishop knew of the follies of prince and favourite during their months at Madrid, and he wanted to be rid of him. The new king was prepared to seek advice from his lord keeper but rarely found it palatable. When Charles attempted to recall his father's last parliament, adjourned in 1624, in the hope that it would hasten his preparations for war, Williams very properly ruled against it on constitutional grounds and time-consuming elections had to be held in a spring heavy with the menace of plague. Justifying himself in print in 1626, Charles cited this ruling as an example of what he was up against. While the plague spread as MPs awaited the arrival of the new queen, and for the first time a bishop of St David's (Laud) prepared to preach at the opening of parliament, Williams kept Westminster School under tight control and repeatedly sought a firm decision on whether the session would hold or not. He regretted the brushing aside of his advice not to convene a parliament at all until such time as Charles was able to make his foreign intentions better known in the country.<br>
<br>Once the parliament of 1625 was in session, however, Williams was soon openly in contact with senior MPs critical of the new king's rush to war, in the form of a maritime expedition likely to be directed against the Spanish coast. Most of them had sat in the 1624 parliament, and were by no means convinced that it had then entered into a commitment to offensive action. The first meeting of the parliament, at Westminster, produced no funding on a scale appropriate to war. Williams advised against adjourning that parliament to Oxford where, as the plague spread westwards, the king failed to secure any further supply at all; yet while recommending an early end to a misjudged meeting, he unavailingly urged Charles not to dissolve the parliament for fear of increasing political unrest in the localities. At Oxford he had been denied the lord keeper's traditional responsibility for informing parliament why it had been convened, giving way to Lord Conway and Sir John Coke, whose assessments of the grounds for urgent military action were altogether more acceptable to Charles.<br>
<br>Williams's three-year term, now long exceeded, provided sufficient grounds for dismissal from the keepership but his fall was so widely expected that, politically, it seemed inevitable. Late in September, Conway somehow forgot to summon him to the privy council, and in early October, Williams thought it advisable to seek Charles's permission to retreat to the house of one of his Panton cousins, Lady Sandys, at Foxley near Windsor, until such time as there was sealing to be done. He last attended the council, at Salisbury, on 24 October and the great seal was removed from him the next day. Sir Thomas Wentworth was among those regretting the downfall of a fellow Hispanophile, ill at ease with the tenor of current foreign policy. Williams still refused to be cowed, and promptly urged George Goring to persuade Buckingham to produce letters he had sent him while lord keeper to establish whether he had ever been disloyal in them. But the duke was bound for The Hague, and had more pressing problems on his mind.<h2>
<a name="Reluctantdiocesanandpoliticalmanoeuvres16251631"></a>Reluctant diocesan and political manoeuvres, 1625&#150;1631</h2>The image Williams presents in his portraits is that of a gentleman rather than a senior cleric, and it was to be ten years before he presided over a visitation of the sprawling diocese of Lincoln, visiting the whole diocese in person in 1634, a year after the metropolitical visitation by Laud's officers, and jauntily remarking that none of his predecessors had done as much &#145;these hundred years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 5.333). Far more pressing in 1625&#150;6 was the delicate business of discovering what, if anything, was left to him in and around the court. What Charles immediately required was that he should keep away from meetings of the privy council and, as he was to have no part in the coronation service, arrange for Laud, then still bishop of St David's, to carry out the ceremonial duties of dean of Westminster. He was also to absent himself from the parliament of 1626, thereby provoking a protracted tussle over the years to assert, with the help of his fellow peers, his entitlement as bishop of Lincoln to sit in the Lords and in convocation. In 1626, he was in danger of having a proxy &#145;thrust upon &hellip; [him] against all precedents&#146;  (Hacket, 2.69), and wrote to Charles squarely blaming Buckingham for this excess before nominating the ailing Andrewes with the proviso that the proxy should not be sent until such time as there was a use for it. His absence coincided with that of seven prominent MPs from 1625, deliberately pricked as high sheriffs in order to keep them out of the Commons in 1626, an act Williams noisily dismissed as frivolous while speculating whether he might now be sheriff of Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>None of Williams's livings was taken from him, however, not even the much-coveted deanery of Westminster. Late in 1625 he was at Buckden, ready to make use of the &pound;5000 allotted in 1622 for urgent repairs to its decaying fabric. He approached Charles again early in March 1626, regretting that he had not been &#145;paid that part of my pension that should pay the creditours, who lent me money to buy the same&#146; even though Charles had directed he should have it, and asking for mitigation of the council's displeasure, especially that of Buckingham &#145;who is so little satisfied with any thing I can doe or suffer that I have no meanes left to appease his anger but my prayers to God and to your sacred Majesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Verulam MSS</span>, 28&#150;9). Charles, on confirming him in office in March 1625, had apparently promised him the archbishopric of York (as James had done in December 1623) or another diocese after he had given up the keepership, and as late as October 1626 Williams still entertained a faint hope of translation to Winchester, assuring Buckingham he &#145;would not receive it &hellip; but as from&#146; him  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/37/87). More immediately, he was faced with the problem of necessary residence in his diocese, and the possibility of leave from it. He was never sure how he stood with the king. Charles granted him permission in the autumn of 1626 to reside that winter at his &#145;poor house&#146; at Westminster  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/37/87) yet when he returned there in the following July to supervise the election of the king's scholars to the universities, he was within days commanded to return forthwith to his bishopric. That November he had to write to secretary Coke beseeching him to get the king's consent to a more flexible arrangement &#145;that I may upon these necessary occasions (the chapter of our college) repair thither, if my sick and crazy state of body will so permit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cowper MSS</span>, 1.329). In 1628, however, the new parliament provided unusual security. After Williams had refused to accept the king's proxy, the lord keeper admitted that he had already been sent a writ of attendance, and the House of Lords promptly invited him to resume his seat. He did so on 1 April 1628 and, as one of the five peers who kept the committee of the whole house in being against Buckingham's wishes, helped to secure the passage of the petition of right.<br>
<br>The duke's death on 23 August did not bring with it any access of royal favour. When, as dean of Westminster, Williams preached in Charles's presence on Good Friday, 3 April 1629, in the regular Lent series of court sermons (as he was to continue to do until 1632) he found that, in Sir Richard Wynn's words, he was &#145;nothinge greater with him than if he had not done it&#146; and so far was he &#145;from the hope of the great Seale&#146; that he returned to Buckden without even the prospect &#145;of being a Courtier&#146;  (Ballinger, no. 1540). Clare visited him there from time to time and at least once Wentworth came too. At court Francis Cottington, Lord Cottington, did his best for him before he went to Madrid for peace negotiations, but he could only report that Charles &#145;objected to the Lustre wherein he lived, the great Company that resorted to him, and his profuse Hospitality &hellip; that it was not the King's Meaning that one whom he had plucked down should live so high&#146;. Charles took it particularly badly that Williams was still &#145;so near a neighbour to Whitehall, but would be better contented if he would part with his Deanery&#146;; but although, as Hacket noted, Williams took some slight account of the first objection, &#145;for the other touch, to relinquish his Deanery, he was utterly deaf unto it&#146;  (Hacket, 2.89). He had good reason. Within days of the House of Lords securing his attendance in 1628 he had preached the Palm Sunday sermon from the abbey pulpit in the presence of his fellow peers, at one point arguing, rather as he had once advised Buckingham, that it was &#145;not the man of the world but the man of God that can judge the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached &hellip; the Sixth of April 1628</span>, 1628, 25). From the same pulpit on Ash Wednesday 1629 he affirmed his Calvinist beliefs in uncompromising terms by stressing the importance of &#145;persevering in patience, repentance and humiliation in time of affliction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perseverantia sanctorum</span>, 1629, 37). His ally the disgruntled earl of Essex, whom he was shortly to visit at Chartley to advise about remarriage, may well have been present. Both sermons were promptly printed by John Bill, the king's printer, and published by order of the Lords.<br>
<br>Yet at much the same time Williams was building at Lincoln College, Oxford where, as bishop of Lincoln he was visitor, what might be regarded as &#145;the beau ideal of a Laudian chapel&#146;  (Newman, quoted in <span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 165). Hacket described its form as &#145;costly, reverend and church-wise&#146;, and it was lavishly endowed with coloured windows, a fine ceiling, walls lined with cedar wood, and copes, plates, books, and &#145;all sort of furniture for the holy table, rich and suitable&#146;  (Hacket, 2.35). Its black and white paving set a new fashion. Richard Corbett, the bishop of Oxford, chose to treat its consecration in September 1631 as an Arminian celebration; but Williams surely intended to provide a timely reminder that the beauty of holiness, in a less ideologically charged form than the Laudian one, had been appreciated in godly communities and their churches long before the ascendancy of an anti-Calvinist episcopacy. Neither Laud, Oxford's chancellor since April 1630, nor the king can have been entirely comfortable with the chapel's associations. Its cost must have been considerable, and yet was borne principally by Williams at a time when he had lost his major office of state.<br>
<br>In less important matters Williams did not shrink from being merely perverse. The choice of a successor to Buckingham as high steward of Westminster was technically in the dean's gift. Almost certainly Williams had received the king's letter ordering him to appoint the lord chamberlain, the earl of Montgomery, before he wrote to secretary Conway from Buckden on 30 August 1628. He confessed to Conway that he dared not intrude on the king, and asked him to inform Charles that he had settled on Buckingham's dearest friend, the unappealing earl of Holland. He had already written to Holland on 29 August telling him of his nomination and, while warning that it would have to be ratified by the chapter, emphasized that it was a profitable office. When told that Charles could not believe that, before proposing Holland, he had not already seen his order about Montgomery, Williams affected innocence. Warned by the king not to contest his decision, he wrote promptly enough to Montgomery; but in contrast to his letter to Holland, he said nothing about the role of the chapter and failed to make it clear either to Montgomery or Charles that any appointment by the dean alone would have a very limited term to it. When ordered to make amends to Montgomery, always a man of uncertain temper, he assured Conway on 16 September 1628 that, as it happened, he would be in town shortly to pay his last respects to the duke of Buckingham, and would then procure a serviceable patent for Montgomery, always providing six of the prebendaries could be convened. In April 1630 he joined John Prideaux in strongly but unsuccessfully backing Montgomery against Laud in the election for Oxford's chancellor, apparently unaware that the king would have preferred Lord Weston. With Cottington away in Madrid, Weston was then serving as Williams's intermediary with Charles; but although he appears to have been the first to raise the possibility of some kind of financial composition with the king, he was never afraid to confront the bishop with the seriousness of his predicament. On Cottington's return, Williams in March 1631 could only report his continuing frustration: Buckingham's death, he now realized, had deprived him of all chance of the duke's forgiveness and left his displeasure &#145;like to proove everlastinge and aeternall&#146;; all in all, he concluded, &#145;by some straunge Witcherye of Fortune or State, the more I endevoured to recover porte, the more I still found myself by one wave or another, dryven from it&#146;  (S. Antiquaries, Lond., MS 203, fol. 7).<h2>
<a name="Episcopallitigant"></a>Episcopal litigant</h2>By then Williams was on the way to becoming a long-term litigant, committing himself to tortuous and continual entanglements in Star Chamber and other courts throughout the 1630s. For the future he still hoped that one or other of several intermediaries might secure for him a reasonable settlement with the king out of court; but his troubles had taken on a new dimension shortly after his arrival at Buckden late in 1625, making it likely that he might have to attempt, by whatever means, to prevail in the courts. As in other dioceses, but on a larger scale than most, Lincoln had numerous well-established vested interests among the officials who administered its various jurisdictions, each jealous of his offices and income. Not all of them welcomed the belated arrival of a bishop with his own reasons for a close interest in such matters, and few dioceses can have had more litigation between its officials, in more courts, than Lincoln in the later 1620s and 1630s. Williams quickly made enemies among the more influential, and more than ever needed discretion. Instead in July 1627 he tried to settle a dispute about how severely puritans should be treated in his courts by calling some of his officials for a meal at Buckden. They included Sir John Lambe, a multiple office-holder in the dioceses of Lincoln and Peterborough, the anti-Calvinist Dr Robert Sibthorpe, who was Lambe's brother-in-law, and Henry Allen, a leading proctor in the diocese, all of them in favour of a firm hand. Allen, who had recently been discomfited by the appointment of John Prigeon as registrar of the commissary court at Leicester, was to keep both the earl of Dorset and Sir John Coke informed about his difficulties with Williams. Prigeon, who was also present, followed Williams in favouring a lighter touch, and had already dismayed Allen by how little he had to show by way of fees and fines from inconformists. At table Williams spoke largely of James I's preference for taking a liberal line with puritans for political reasons, a probable breach of privy council confidentiality.<br>
<br>By November 1627 some account of Williams's remarks had been sent to the king by Allen and, no doubt aware that his critics were stirring but not knowing how, Williams had himself felt obliged to send Charles, by way of Buckingham, a vaguely worded petition dated 13 February 1628, apologizing for any rash words spoken in the king's presence without mention of Allen's accusation. Later in the year Allen sent a second petition with further information about the bishop's excesses, but it led only to Allen's examination before Weston and three others, at the end of which he was condemned as being &#145;as good as frentick&#146;, having drawn up one of his petitions in rhyme  (Hacket, 2.113). In the Lords debate on 13 June 1628 Williams spoke firmly against Robert Sibthorpe and his offensively Arminian preaching. Thus encouraged, Prigeon petitioned the Commons in February 1629 with counter-accusations against Allen, in the process revealing the nature of Allen's charges, which had been sealed and put in the keeping of William Trumbull, clerk of the council, but which had nevertheless become known to him. After the session ended Allen, who had submitted books and papers in anticipation of making his defence, complained that Trumbull, Sir Ralph Freeman, and John Wright, the clerk to parliament, were all in Williams's interest, and were reluctant to hand them back. The agitation hardly contributed to the peace and quiet of the church on which Charles was insistent and for this reason as much as others Williams should not have been surprised at the king's coldness after his Lenten sermon that year.<br>
<br>A composite bill, based partly on the examinations of Lambe, Sibthorpe, Allen, and another official, Reginald Burden, was lodged in Star Chamber shortly afterwards. It addressed Williams's attitude towards puritans, and his &#145;publishing divers false Tales and News to the scandal of his majesty's Government&#146; as well as &#145;revealing some things contrary to the duty of his place and oath as a Privy Councillor&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.771, 772). Some of the examinations had been leaked to Williams, apparently by Sir William Becher, like Trumbull a clerk of the council. In characteristic fashion the preliminaries moved with what Williams regarded as satisfactory slowness through interrogatories and examinations, their plenary process offering the unscrupulous ample opportunity for tampering with the record. At Christmas 1631 he had time to travel to Fawley Court in Buckinghamshire to consecrate Whitelocke's new chapel with &#145;maximum ostentation&#146; and with Bishop Robert Wright of Bristol and other senior clergy in attendance, heedless of the generally disapproving attitude of Laud and Neile to chapels and chaplains  (Heal and Holmes, 369).<br>
<br>It was only after a petition by Lambe, in February 1632, that the case got under way. The king's order on 12 February that it should do so also made it clear that Williams's long suspension from the council had now ended in dismissal, reportedly drawing from Williams words of such defiance that Peter Heylyn, recently the king's choice for a prebend at Westminster, took care to pass them on to secretary Coke that July. If the testimony of Richard Kilvert is to be believed, Williams again took every opportunity to defer and deflect the action. Kilvert's comments are contained in one of his newsletters to Lambe, and his interest in the bishop's affairs was to develop into heavy-handed investigations on behalf of the crown. But more reliable sources also suggest that Williams took a delight in pitting his wits against councillors and lawyers, no matter how flimsy his grounds. There can be no doubt that the privy council grew tired of his evasiveness when at the board and his elusiveness when absent. The case was still limping through 1633 when it was halted by a collateral action which was to take on major significance, and which was pursued to final sentence.<br>
<br>This second bill arose out of an attempt finally to discredit one of Williams's key witnesses, John Prigeon. A man of doubtful reputation, he was accused, with a fair show of evidence, of fathering a bastard by a local girl, but his guilt took several sessions to establish firmly. In the absence of most of his principal accusers he was acquitted of the charge at a quarter sessions in Lincolnshire in May 1633. A minor gentleman called Booth, a recusant, was held responsible; and there were signs that Williams had been busily influencing witnesses. At the October sessions, when more JPs were present, the earlier verdict was reversed, and the chairman of the bench, Sir John Monson, a kinsman of Booth who had his own associations with the court and king, ordered that Prigeon should accept responsibility, which he did. Williams had, however, again been at work behind the scenes. In the charged words of Sir John Bankes, attorney-general from August 1634, there had been &#145;such tampering, seducing, and labouring of the king's witnesses as never was in any cause &hellip; such instructions &hellip; to his own witnesses, to direct them how far they should swear, and to what to give answer and to what not&#146; that it was clear that a new action in Star Chamber might now lie against him, charging him with perverting the course of justice by suborning witnesses  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.772). Williams did not help himself by carelessly throwing scorn on the October quarter sessions' decision, dismissing it as a pocket order, made in an inn or alehouse, for his jibe stung Monson, who was to provide crucial impetus to the bill's progress in its later stages. It also served to deflect attention from the possibility that Lambe and his friends had ventured upon a similar game.<br>
<br>With the original bill set aside for the time being because of doubts about its supporting testimony, the second, collateral, bill provided the ground on which Williams's immediate fate was to be decided. As normal in Star Chamber, its preliminaries moved slowly; and although there was a growing view within the council that this time Williams would have to be nailed, Cottington came close in the autumn of 1635 to agreeing a settlement for Williams with the king. A fine of &pound;4000 and the surrender of two livings, then one of &pound;8000 and retention of his deanery, were both mooted; but, as unsatisfied as ever, Williams wanted better terms. He began to use other intermediaries as well, and the moment passed. It served, however, to alert Laud, who was already relishing his role of bearer of ill tidings after approaching the king on his behalf, as Williams from time to time asked him to do, and by his own account on each occasion getting brusquely rebuffed. He now intervened in his own interest, convincing Charles that he should put all thoughts of composition with Williams aside. Laud may not, however, have brought about the resumption of prosecution. That was almost certainly the result of a conversation between Monson and the king at Belvoir late in 1635, prompted by Monson's determination to get redress for Williams's slur but also covering the whole scope of the case. Laud had heard of it by 14 January but it was only on 9 August 1636 that Monson sent him a detailed account of the Belvoir meeting, as though for the record, showing that the king had freely admitted he was in negotiation over a settlement with Williams late in 1635, but that &#145;he had not then given anye assurance of the Tearmes, nor would, if mye Information weare truth&#146;  (LPL, MS 1030, fol. 78).<h2>
<a name="Sentencesuspensionandimprisonment"></a>Sentence, suspension, and imprisonment</h2>The coils were already tightening around the bishop when early in November 1636, as the preliminaries continued, Cottington &#145;did quite discharge himself from anye more dealinge with my Buisines, mislikinge me to make use of some other mediator (nameinge none)&#146; as Williams confided in Laud some weeks later  (LPL, MS 1030, fol. 82<i>v</i>). Before the final proceedings in Star Chamber began in the Trinity law vacation of 1637, Charles reminded the bench of the damage done to Sir John Monson's honour. The judges, guided by a preliminary discussion in inner Star Chamber which Bankes also attended, presented an unusual front of unity at the end of an exhausting nine-day hearing, scarcely varying from one another in their recommendations after Cottington had given the lead. The sentence on 11 July 1637 was a heavy one, intended, as Laud thought, to have &#145;that fierce mastiv tyed up &hellip; until he [the king] finds means to secure him from doing more hurt to himself, the state and the church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 7.370). Williams was to be suspended by high commission from his benefices and offices with loss of revenue, fined &pound;10,000, and imprisoned in the Tower of London at the king's pleasure; Monson was awarded 1000 marks in damages. Even then there were attempts to ease his lot within the inner circles of the court where the residual influence of the Villiers womenfolk survived. Before sentence young James Stuart, fourth duke of Lennox, proffered &pound;10,000 to buy him peace and quiet; and immediately afterwards James Hamilton, marquess of Hamilton, failed in an attempt to get the king to vary its terms. Within days Cottington &#145;with his usual retinue&#146; paid Laud a visit at Croydon, as if to confirm that all went well but, in Laud's view, also to see what prospect there might now be to try again for an overall settlement with Charles, giving Williams freedom from further prosecution  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 7.369&#150;70). But so quickly was an extent placed on the bishop's Caernarvonshire estates to cover his fine that it was taken as a sure sign that &#145;the king is much displeased with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 6.118), while Kilvert's respectable brother-in-law, the prince's tutor Dr Brian Duppa, hastened to register his interest in the profits of the deanery of Westminster. Kilvert himself was reported to have received &pound;1500 from the king, as from the bishop's fine.<br>
<br>After his solitary visit to Croydon, Cottington turned instead, by way of Holland, to the queen. At the king's bidding, she got Edward Sackville, fourth earl of Dorset, to negotiate, and once more Williams proved awkward. He now so mistrusted Wentworth, who had grown close to Laud, that he declined to go to Ireland on any terms; and he refused to concede that his recent book, <span class="italic">The Holy Table, Name and Thing</span> (1636), was doctrinally unsound, as Charles required him to do. Published anonymously in March 1636, as though from a minister of Lincolnshire but licensed by the bishop of Lincoln, <span class="italic">The Holy Table</span> soon exhausted its initial run of 1400 copies, the work of several printers. It provided a rebuttal to Peter Heylyn's anonymous and opportunist <span class="italic">A Coale from the Altar, or, An Answer to a Letter to the Vicar of Grantham</span> (late 1636), one of several works from a small group of new prebendaries of Westminster anxious to make the most of Williams's troubles. The letter Heylyn used had been written by Williams, as his diocesan, to Peter Titley of Grantham back in 1627 and it had somehow surfaced again. In it Williams had advised against usage which became official policy as a result of the order of king in council at the close of the St Gregory's case in November 1633. Ingenuously Heylyn purported to believe that the letter could not have been written by a bishop of the Church of England. Williams's rejoinder in <span class="italic">The Holy Table</span> did no more than reiterate traditional values contained in the Elizabethan settlement, and enunciated by Richard Hooker among others. He argued that the parish communion table ought to be aligned east and west and not altarwise at the end of the chancel, and that it was permissible to move the table for the celebration of holy communion. Unusually for a confirmed Calvinist, however, he also believed in railing-in tables, on all four sides if they remained in the old position; and at his own visitation in 1635 he seems to have hoped his insistence on railing might be enough to divert attention from his favoured position for the table. It was only subsequent to the visitation, and particularly after his removal to the Tower, that conversions of tables into altars took place in any number within his diocese. Laud, impressed that the book was &#145;almost an inch thick&#146; in quarto, thought there was &#145;wit, and reading and scorn enough&#151;more like the doings of a young Master of Arts than a Bishop&#146; and with &#145;as little judgement in it as there need be&#146;; while Garrard, who found it learned and sharp, predicted it was likely to &#145;breed some Trouble&#146; of a kind which Williams was almost daily bringing on himself (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 7.337; <span class="italic">Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 2.57). But Laud made nothing of his uniquely ambivalent attitude to the table, and he does not seem to have suffered for it while his trial proceeded or in its aftermath.<br>
<br>Still in the Tower, Williams was unable to attend further proceedings against him in Star Chamber in February 1639 to answer a charge of having at his palace at Buckden letters from the former Westminster schoolmaster Laurence Osbaldeston abusing Laud and other dignitaries in terms with which Laud, at least, was becoming familiar. The letters had come into Kilvert's hands during one of his forays into the bishop's papers, and he made the most of them. Williams was fined &pound;5000 to the king and &pound;3000 to Laud. The earl of Leicester's agent William Hawkins noted that his servants had fallen from him and &#145;his friends are not many that dare appeare for him&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 6.140). Yet even though Williams was not summoned to the Short Parliament in April 1640, small gestures hinting at future reconciliation were to be seen. A further Star Chamber bill against him for subornation of witnesses was held over in February 1640 and Hawkins, among others, hoped that he might make his peace &#145;if he come to his Majestie with as much submission as he ought&#146;  (ibid., 6.230). A Rossingham newsletter reported that he had for a few hours left the Tower for a meeting with Laud at Lambeth on 4 May, and as a result he had, apparently voluntarily, withdrawn <span class="italic">The Holy Table</span>. But Charles's mood changed when after parliament had been dissolved on 5 May a search was made into the effects of several leading peers and MPs. When John Hampden, a kinsman, turned out his pockets, they revealed a recent letter from Williams asking him to move in the Commons for his writ of summons to the Lords as an issue of general concern to parliament, on the precedent of Sir John Strangway's motion for the earl of Bristol in 1626. With the letter was Hampden's draft reply, counselling caution and further consultation with friends; but it did little to appease the king.<br>
<br>Probably anticipating a new parliament, Williams wrote to the earl of Arundel on 2 October 1640, ostensibly to seek relief from the Tower, now noisy with soldiery, by being allowed to move under supervision to the countryside. His real purpose was to explain that his proposition to Hampden had been of little account, &#145;made &hellip; and recalled in twenty-four hours&#146; at least ten days earlier, and that his need to establish his entitlement to sit in parliament remained: the first approach he had from the king about his writ of summons to the Short Parliament had been on 4 May, the eve of its dissolution. The earl marshal should know that he did not &#145;go about to excuse this accident [with Hampden] otherwise than in humbly craving pardon of his Majesty&#146; if he had offended him  (<span class="italic">Fairfax Correspondence</span>, 1.341). He had, however, certainly upset the constable of the Tower who, as Sir Francis Windebank had already written to Charles at York on 18 September, complained that Williams's presence was such &#145;a very great inconvenience and hindrance&#146; to the king's service that he wanted him sent to another prison. This drew from Charles a rare touch of humour: &#145;I know none, except it were Hanworthe [in Middlesex, Cottington's nearest country house]&#146;, adding over-confidently, &#145;in earnest I know none, nor see I reason why he should be a hindrance&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 2.118).<br>
<br>The king was soon disabused when he tried to strike a bargain with Williams for the new parliament: he might take his seat in the Lords, but must return to the Tower when the parliament was over, unless pardoned in the meantime. Given the sensitivity of both houses to irregular exclusions, the offer was ill judged. Incensed at this further restriction on a fellow peer, on 16 November 1640 the Lords ordered his unconditional release from the Tower. Charles then gave way so far as to relieve Williams of the consequences of his Star Chamber sentence, thus restoring his ecclesiastical authority and leaving him to be received &#145;as it were in triumph&#146; on his return to parliament. Not only was the constable of the Tower gratified but Laud, close to confinement himself, was even rumoured to have invited him to dinner, despite having thrown him &#145;soe many bones to knawe&#146; during the 1630s  (Gardiner, 187).<h2>
<a name="Releaseandrehabilitation16401642"></a>Release and rehabilitation, 1640&#150;1642</h2>Williams's first act as restored dean of Westminster was to move the holy table at St Margaret's to the middle of the church so that it was ready for the Commons' communion service on the coming Sunday, 22 November, an act intended to reveal any MPs with Catholic leanings. In the Lords he was soon appointed to the committees of privileges and petitions, possibly with the aid of the earl of Essex. More important, he increasingly assumed a leading role among those peers hoping to steer a responsible course between zealots on either wing of the church, especially those for root-and-branch reform. He was thus, in changing times, more in tune with the king's thinking than often in the past. While jeering crowds chanted &#145;Little Willy, art thou there?&#146; as Laud settled into the Tower, Williams was named, on Lord Saye and Sele's motion in the Lords on 1 March 1641, as chairman of the committee for innovations in matters of religion  (Ballinger, no. 1677). In time he also chaired its subcommittee of assistants, with a core of Calvinist prelates such as Archbishop James Ussher, Thomas Morton, and Joseph Hall, influential moderates like Ralph Brownrig, Daniel Featley, John Prideaux, Richard Holdsworth, and Hacket, as well as zealous ministers like Stephen Marshall, Edmund Calamy, and Matthew Newcomen. Robert Sanderson, a well-disposed Laudian, was also included. He was among the majority of the small group of bishops, consulted by the king on 9 May 1641 about his response to the earl of Strafford's bill of attainder, who advised him to &#145;submit in judgement to those who were learned in the law&#146;, as George Radcliffe put it, thereby satisfying his public conscience, as king, no matter what private misgivings he had  (<span class="italic">Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 2.432). The earl of Clarendon, but not <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>, reserved particular venom for Williams's contribution. He urged the king to reject the bill removing his right to dissolve parliament without the consent of the two houses and, after Charles had failed to do so, pointedly asked him whether it would in future be possible for his &#145;true lieges&#146; any longer to serve him  (Hacket, 2.162).<br>
<br>But Williams was solidly with the king in his determination to preserve episcopacy. In May 1641 he spoke in committee in the Lords against the bill for excluding bishops from parliament and on 1 July he introduced a detailed and considered bill intended to regulate church government, no doubt as part of Charles's recently advertised intention of getting back to Elizabethan purity. Bishops were to have twelve assistants to help with ordination and with exercising their jurisdiction, and when a see fell vacant other bishops were to ensure that three names were presented to the king so that he could choose a successor; like other cathedral clergy, they were all to preach regularly; and none was to be a JP except a bishop who was also dean of Westminster, a plurality Charles was unlikely to encourage. Church courts were also to be reformed. Reasonable men in both houses wished the bill well but after its second reading in the Lords, it was lost from view in committee.<br>
<br>Williams slipped up, however, after he and other bishops had struggled through hostile crowds to reach the House of Lords on 27 December 1641. Supported by eleven of his fellows, he presented Charles with a petition declaring that they could not attend the House of Lords while their lives were in danger, and that in their absence all proceedings since 27 December were to be null and void. Here was a chance Pym was not going to miss. After the Commons had listened to the lord keeper reading the bishops' protest on 30 December, they voted to impeach all twelve, thereby depriving the upper house of their votes. Williams thus found himself back in the Tower, this time not alone and mocked as the decoy duck. Less than a month earlier Charles, anxious to advance men of settled views within the church, had made him archbishop of York. When he was eventually released on 5 May 1642 the terms of his bail forbade him to venture into Yorkshire, but he still headed for York, where the king then was, and on 27 June 1642 was enthroned as archbishop of the northern province, too late to make up for lost time, but claiming a prize he had long coveted.<h2>
<a name="MilitantarchbishopWelshretirementandeducationalbenefactor"></a>Militant archbishop, Welsh retirement, and educational benefactor</h2>After doing what he could to fortify his run-down castle at Cawood, Archbishop Williams did not linger in Yorkshire. He fled at young John Hotham's approach and only assumed the role of militant archbishop, in which Wenceslas Hollar's fine print neatly cast him, after arriving safely at Conwy on 4 October 1642. He had no official standing in north Wales, but depended heavily on his status as a landowner and a descendant of ancient gentry families. He spent so freely from his own funds in making Conwy Castle serviceable that the king made it over to him until he could recover his expenses. He did what he could to organize the local militia in the royalist interest, and establish adequate sea defences, making regular contact with the marquess of Ormond in Ireland and co-operating fully with Prince Rupert while he was active in north Wales. More broadly, his aims were to support the garrison city of Chester and to retain access to the sea for royalist forces. But all the time, the archbishop was aware that some form of settlement might prove the most satisfactory outcome, and grew to mistrust the high-handed single-mindedness of the local royalist commander John Owen, whom he regretted having recommended, while at Oxford, to the king as a possible sheriff. Charles had promptly knighted him and made him governor of Conwy. As the king's cause faded Owen became more peremptory. Early in May 1645 he broke into the castle, seized Williams's goods and those his neighbours had deposited there for safe keeping, and exhibited nine articles accusing the archbishop of what he called &#145;high treason&#146;. Charles eventually disciplined him; but Williams was confirmed in his drift towards an accommodation, achieved in June 1646, with Thomas Mytton the parliamentarian commander, whom he found easier to deal with than Owen's superior, Sir Nicholas Byron. Some thought it treachery; but with the king in the hands of the Scots, it looked to most to be a realistic decision.<br>
<br>Williams spent much of his remaining life with the Wynns at Gwydir but he died, intestate, from quinsy on 25 March 1650 while staying with Sir John's daughter, Mary Mostyn, at Gloddaith. He was buried in the nearby parish church of St Tegai at Llandyg&aacute;i, close to Penrhyn Castle, where a small marble monument with a flowing tribute from Hacket was erected on the south wall of the chancel, with his helmet and spurs on a bracket nearby. It was a far cry from the high pomp of some of the Westminster funerals he had conducted. Afterwards there was talk of at least two wills, but none was found. His affairs had been disordered ever since his fall in 1625, and he and his servants had grown used to dispersing his papers and evidences &#145;to avoyd Kilvert's Par[r]ie&#146;, particularly during the 1630s  (Ballinger, no. 2870); some of his properties in Huntingdonshire were thought to have been bought in other men's names  (ibid., nos. 2005, 2014). He had always meant, but not quite managed, to provide for Sir John Wynn's dull son Owen, who had married his favourite niece, Grace, more than twenty years earlier; it took a series of actions in chancery by Owen and his cousins to establish a final settlement, the bulk of it to his next heir at common law, Griffith Williams, a nephew the archbishop had never thought much of.<br>
<br>By 1627 Williams's total estate within Caernarvonshire, including three manors and two ferries newly leased from the crown, may well have covered &#145;something like one-third&#146; of its overall area  (Dodd, 138). Yet despite his continual concern with north Welsh affairs, his major expenditure on buildings was elsewhere. In his home county he quickly recovered Cochwillan, an ageing part of his heritage, after his cousin Henry Williams, preferring the comfort of his Elizabethan mansion of Y Faenol, had sold it to the third earl of Pembroke in 1620; later it became known as the archbishop's barn. He also acquired a large and run-down part of the Penrhyn estate, including its medieval house, which had been the foundation of his family's fortunes. He had been reluctant to venture on Penrhyn but Sir John Wynn's brother, Ellis, the clerk of petty bag in chancery, who seemed to Hacket to know everyone that mattered, had lent him more than &pound;1000 to do so in 1622, and then carried the purchase through for him and paid off the mortgage as well. Ellis Wynn, who occupied the prebendal house at Westminster intended for Laud, died in September 1623 while buying his cousin a manor in Northamptonshire from one of the Cecils. Had he lived, Williams believed he would have made him &#145;a huge rich man&#146;  (Ballinger, no. 1941). As it was, some weekly household reckonings for Penrhyn in 1646 do not suggest poverty: if maintained over the year, expenditure on food alone must have amounted to almost &pound;900.<br>
<br>Williams had had resources enough to give &pound;2000, over half the overall cost, towards a new library at St John's, Cambridge, built by 1628 in what he intended to be an appropriately gothic style, to house books originally collected by William Crashawe, a former fellow, and donated by the third earl of Southampton. Wentworth, another member of the college, chose to believe the library compared favourably with anything Laud might have at St John's, Oxford. Williams had spent even more at Lincoln College, Oxford, one of the five colleges where as bishop of Lincoln he was visitor (Balliol, Brasenose, and Oriel at Oxford, King's at Cambridge, were the others). As dean of Westminster he shouldered many expenses which came his way in the course of his duties, as he told John Coke in March 1636 when defending himself against Heylyn and his allies. He sent eight, and sometimes ten, scholars to university each year where once there had been four. From the increased revenues of the church, he had bought plate and ornaments to the value of &pound;700. He had also improved the stipends of the prebends, including those who had complained. Out of his own means he estimated he had &#145;laid out upon the Library and the repairs of the Church between &pound;5000 and &pound;6000&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cowper MSS</span>, 2.112). A library was also bought for Buckden, from which Clare and Wentworth borrowed a book of parliamentary notes and precedents in 1627; and he spent freely on its gardens. He founded eight scholarships at Westminster School as well as four more, and two fellowships, at St John's, Cambridge. The St John's scholarships were worth only &pound;5 a year, less than Westminster ones; but they were open to pupils from Wales and the diocese of Lincoln as well as Westminster and were backed by well-funded livings which Williams had put at the disposal of his old college. He set up charities in parishes with which he was associated, as at Walgrave and belatedly at Honington in 1633. Sir John Wynn was asked in November 1621 to look out for a piece of land fit to produce an annuity of &pound;30 to &pound;40 for a free school in Conwy.<br>
<br>Inherited wealth, profits from office, income from at least some of Williams's estates, helpful friends, and freedom from family expenses may be enough to explain his ability to spend heavily, on lavish entertainment as much as on buildings and scholarships, and his release in January 1641 from what remained of his Star Chamber fine must also have helped in wartime; but, as Hacket found, it is difficult to be sure quite where much of his income came from. Even in reflective mood towards the end of his life, Williams remained unhelpfully vague, separated as he was from many of his papers and evidences. There was talk of disposing of property by deed rather than bequest; but in unsettled times little seems to have been done. If he had written a final will it is likely that his assets, whatever they were, would simply have been devoted to charitable uses. That would have gratified Thomas Fairfax, Lord Fairfax, the parliamentary general and once of St John's College, Cambridge, who while in London in July 1637 had noticed with approval how Williams was regarded on the City streets as one who &#145;bestowed most of his revenues in pious works and charitable deeds&#146;, which his imprisonment would surely curtail  (<span class="italic">Fairfax Correspondence</span>, 1.338).<h2>
<a name="Reputationandassessment"></a>Reputation and assessment</h2>William was nothing if not a man of high passion and restless ambition, delighting in his own cleverness. James often indulged him, relishing his learning as well as his wit, seemingly unflustered by his extravagant hospitality and flamboyant lifestyle. Williams's brand of Calvinism readily found a place in the Jacobean church and court. But after he lost the keepership late in 1625, within months of James's death, his friends doubted whether he would be able to &#145;keep within a circle&#146; and restrain his inclination to break ranks long enough to win Charles's favour  (Ballinger, no. 1406). He must have been one of very few courtiers that James had had to urge to pay his respects to Buckingham; and he was never close to Charles. Both mistrusted him and, unlike James, were unsettled by his knowingness on all too many fronts. Complexity attracted him, and he seldom behaved in a wholly straightforward way. He could be drawn, too, into indiscretion, every so often talking too freely and too loudly about subjects best left unmentioned. In giving hostages to fortune, he became vulnerable to men of little scruple, like Sir John Lambe and his associates, and found himself having to devote time and energy to fending off one of the more notorious of the king's enquiry agents.<br>
<br>Yet Williams had, and retained, an exceptionally varied circle of friends, too numerous to catalogue, who tried to minimize the damage caused by his excesses. His critics, too, conceded his wider popularity, while muttering that it was only because he was &#145;bold enough to adventure upon that which few else will&#146;, as Laud remarked to Wentworth in October 1638; but Williams very early saw the dangers in Charles's authoritarian tendencies in a way Laud did not  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 7.493). Indeed, for a man of volatile temperament, he proved in his own distinctive way notably steady in his Calvinist faith, his political leanings towards Spain, and his support for libraries, schools, and colleges. He also did much, in and out of the Tower, to clarify the constitutional position of a peer kept from parliament. Above all, Williams refused to be forgotten. If he often made life difficult for himself, he also knew how to survive, even as a primate without a province. Unlike several of his old enemies he died in his bed, at an advanced age, surrounded by members of his family, and with the settlement he had for the past twenty years been about to bestow on Owen Wynn and his wife still only days from signing and sealing.<br>
