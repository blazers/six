</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Adrian,  Richard Hume</span>, second Baron Adrian  (1927&#150;1995), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 16 October 1927 in Grange Road, Cambridge, the only son and youngest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30753/', "Edgar Douglas Adrian, first Baron Adrian (1889&#150;1977)")</script>, physiologist, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65865/', "Hester Agnes Adrian")</script>, daughter of Hume Chancellor Pinsent, a solicitor in Birmingham, and his wife <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35531/', "Ellen Frances Pinsent")</script>. On his father's side he was descended from an earlier Richard Adrian, a Huguenot refugee who had fled to England after the massacre of St Bartholomew in 1572; the line of descent also includes a surgeon who attended Sir Philip Sidney after the battle of Zutphen, clerics, a silk weaver, and three generations of civil servants. Hester Pinsent's family was related on her father's side to the philosopher David Hume; both she and her mother were created DBE for their work on mental health.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>At the age of eight Adrian went to King's College School, Cambridge, but early in the Second World War he and his twin sister, Jennet, were sent to the USA to live with the family of Detlev Bronk, who had worked with Adrian's father in Cambridge and who was at that time director of the Johnson Foundation in Philadelphia. There Adrian spent three years at Swarthmore high school. He was, though, anxious to return to England as soon as possible and, after graduating from high school and spending one semester at Swarthmore College, he went home in late 1943 to join Westminster School, still evacuated to Herefordshire. In January 1945 he entered Cambridge as an undergraduate at Trinity College, reading for the natural sciences tripos and choosing subjects appropriate for medicine.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Adrian was greatly influenced by Alan Hodgkin, who had just returned from his wartime work on radar and, with Andrew Huxley, was resuming work on the mechanism of message transmission along nerves&#151;work which had been halted at a most promising stage by Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. In his third year Adrian took the advanced course in physiology, completed his double first, and decided that he wanted to be a physiologist. At that time it was still conventional for physiologists to be medically qualified, and in 1948 he went to University College Hospital, London, to take the clinical course. He said later that he was glad to have done so, and that it taught him many things, especially about people, that he would not otherwise have learned. One of these things was that he did not enjoy clinical work; he completed his medical qualifications without the full year of house jobs that later became a prerequisite for registration. By this time the war had been over for six years, but having been exempt from military service during his medical training Adrian was now drafted into the Royal Army Medical Corps and sent to the chemical defence experimental establishment at Porton Down. There he worked on protective measures against mustard gas and nerve gases, and on more theoretically interesting questions about the actions of nerve gases particularly at synapses.<br>
<br>Released from the army early in 1954, Adrian spent four months &#145;in an extended journey in the Middle East (Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, the Lebanon) mostly with an archaeological interest&#151;inevitably with a growing interest in the unsettled politics of the region&#146;  (Adrian, 1993). This was the start of an important facet of his life. At archaeological digs he seems to have been a useful visitor. The archaeologist David Oates described the impression that Adrian made on a party of visiting German archaeologists by his skill with an esoteric piece of surveying equipment with which the visitors were unfamiliar&#151;a skill he had acquired the previous day.<h2>
<a name="Researchintomusclebehaviour"></a>Research into muscle behaviour</h2>In the autumn of 1954 Adrian returned to Cambridge to begin work as a research student in the physiological laboratory, under the supervision of Alan Hodgkin. Within two years he had discovered a major source of error in the standard method of using microelectrodes to determine the voltage difference across cell membranes, and had shown how such errors could be avoided. The fundamental problem that he was preparing to tackle, and to whose solution over the next thirty years he was to make a massive contribution, is called by physiologists the problem of excitation-contraction coupling. It is to understand how the spread of excitation along the surface of a muscle fibre activates the contractile machinery that forms the bulk of the fibre. By the mid-1950s Hodgkin and Huxley had shown that transmission along nerve fibres is fully explained by sequential changes in the selective permeability of the surface membrane to sodium ions and potassium ions&#151;changes caused by the peculiar responses of the relevant ion channels to changes in voltage. There was good evidence that spread of excitation along a muscle fibre was essentially similar.<br>
<br>The mid-1950s also led to major advances in understanding of the contractile machinery. In muscle the two main proteins form interdigitating sliding rods, whose overlap increases in the presence of adenosine triphosphate and calcium ions. Since adenosine triphosphate is always present but the concentration of calcium ions is very low in the resting fibre, it seemed likely that excitation-contraction coupling involved the release of calcium ions deep within the fibre. The crucial question was: how do the changes at the surface membrane trigger this release?<br>
<br>The work of microscopists had shown that the fibres of skeletal muscle possess two systems of tubules&#151;transverse tubules, running at right angles to the fibre surface and opening onto that surface, and longitudinal tubules forming a closed network within the fibre, and expanding into little &#145;cisterns&#146; where they abut on the transverse tubules. The fluid in the cisterns is rich in calcium ions, and one possibility was that passive spread of electrical current from the surface of the fibre down the transverse tubules somehow released calcium from the cisterns. By a long series of ingenious experiments and careful mathematical analysis, however, Adrian and his colleagues showed that passive spread of current could not explain the observed behaviour, and that a mechanism very similar to that responsible for the conduction of an impulse along the surface of the fibre must be responsible for conducting an impulse along the membranes of the transverse tubules into the depths of the fibre. They also found evidence for the movements of charged particles at the junction between the transverse and longitudinal tubules&#151;movements that they suspected were involved in triggering the release of calcium ions. Later work has confirmed their suspicions and suggests that molecules of two kinds interact. One acts as a sensor that changes shape in response to a change of voltage across the membrane of the transverse tubule; the other forms a channel in the membrane of the adjacent cistern&#151;a channel that is opened by the change in shape of the sensor.<br>
<br>Although most of Adrian's work was concerned with the behaviour of normal muscle, he and his colleagues were also interested in the rare inherited disease myotonia congenita, first described in humans more than a century ago but also found in goats. The characteristic feature of this disease is that contraction of a muscle tends to persist after the cessation of voluntary effort. A human patient cannot relax his grip; a startled goat tends to fall over. Four myotonic goats were dispatched from Cincinnati, and the work nearly foundered at an early stage when they arrived at London airport without any papers. It was, the customs man explained on the telephone, against the rule for animals to be disembarked without proper papers, and the goats would have to be shot. Eventually, however, Adrian persuaded him that though the goats could not properly be disembarked there could be no objection to their being &#145;disemplaned&#146;. A detailed analysis of the electrical properties of the muscles of these goats showed that the accumulation of potassium ions in the transverse tubules, coupled with the (known) abnormally low chloride permeability of the surface membrane of the muscle fibres, could account for the continued excitation of the muscle after excitation through the nerve had stopped. It became reasonable to assume that a similar explanation accounted for the symptoms in human patients.<h2>
<a name="Cambridgecareer"></a>Cambridge career</h2>Adrian was elected to a research fellowship at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1955, and to a teaching fellowship and university demonstratorship in the following year. A university lectureship followed in 1961, a readership (in experimental biophysics) in 1968, and (following Adrian's election to the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1977) an <i>ad hominem</i> professorship in cell physiology in 1978, the year he was also awarded the Cambridge MD degree on the basis of published work; he had been given an honorary doctorate by the University of Poitiers in the previous year.<br>
<br>Adrian enjoyed his time at Corpus Christi and made lasting friendships there. It was at a dinner given by the master, the physicist Sir George Thomson, that he met a striking young Newnham research student, Lucy Caroe (<i>b</i>. 1935), daughter of the architect Alban Douglas Rendall Caroe and granddaughter of Sir William Bragg, and on 1 April 1967 she became his wife. The college still reflected some of the conservatism of the twenty-five-year reign of the previous master, Sir William Spens. During a period as dean of college Adrian sometimes found it necessary to protect lively undergraduates from crusty dons, and it was probably this that later gave him the reputation of having been something of a &#145;young Turk&#146;. In 1961 he accepted an invitation to become tutor for natural sciences at the newly founded Churchill College, Cambridge, and he remained a fellow of Churchill for the next twenty years, becoming an honorary fellow in 1985.<br>
<br>In 1981 Adrian was elected master of Pembroke College&#151;an unusual appointment, for he was not a Pembroke man. A contentious problem needing urgent attention was the admission of women, and it is a measure of Adrian's skill as master that by June 1982 the college had agreed to their admission, and that this agreement had been reached with only seven votes cast against and with no ill feeling. During the eleven years of Adrian's mastership the academic standing of the college rose, the number of graduate students doubled, undergraduate accommodation was increased, stonework was cleaned, and for two years the boat club even went &#145;head of the river&#146;. The college continued to be a very friendly society; the master, though an agnostic, willingly and admirably performed his duties in chapel; and Lucy Adrian was an excellent hostess in the master's lodge while continuing her work as a fellow of Newnham.<br>
<br>At the time Adrian was master of Pembroke, the vice-chancellor of the university held office for only two years and was chosen from among the heads of the colleges. In 1985 Adrian was an obvious choice. He had succeeded his father in the House of Lords in 1977, like him choosing to sit on the cross-benches. In 1979 he became a founder member of the House of Lords select committee on science and technology, and by 1985 he was also a member of the Home Office committee on animal experiments, a trustee of the British Museum and of the Natural History Museum, a member of the British Library board, chairman of the governing body of the Agricultural and Food Research Council's Animal Virus Research Institute, and a member of the governing bodies of Imperial College and of Westminster School. He had also been an extremely influential member of the House of Lords select committee on the <span class="roman">Laboratory Animals Protection Bill</span>, had served on the council of the Royal Society and on the Medical Research Council's neurosciences board, and had represented Cambridge University on the General Medical Council.<br>
<br>As vice-chancellor Adrian was independent, conscientious, and well-informed. He was an excellent chairman, invariably courteous and fair, saying rather little but always effectively, and ready to oppose pressure groups if he felt they were not pursuing useful policies. His main anxieties were eloquently summarized in his annual addresses, which he wrote himself, being one of the last vice-chancellors to do so. His first concern was the financial stringency caused by the decrease in real terms of the government grant; and his second was the increasingly dirigiste attitude to individual universities of the government, the University Grants Committee (UGC), and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals: &#145;It used to be said that the UGC was a characteristic British device for insulating universities from Government. We delude ourselves if we continue in that belief&#146;  (Adrian, 1986). Adrian felt strongly that universities would remain independent only if they could raise a much greater fraction of their funds from non-government sources, and while he was vice-chancellor two major steps were taken towards this aim. A development office was set up, and a company was created through which the university could profit from commercial developments arising from research in its various departments. In addition, five new professorships were established, four of them with the help of new benefactions, and the first interdisciplinary research centre (in superconductivity) was started. The administrative machinery at the core of the university was also strengthened: the comatose long-term planning committee was reconstituted under the chairmanship of the vice-chancellor, and a small vice-chancellor's advisory group was formed. Adrian's main contribution to opposing the government's dirigiste tendency, though, came not during his vice-chancellorship but two years later, during the House of Lords' discussion of the <span class="roman">Education Reform Act</span> of 1988, when he played an important part in limiting the government's powers to interfere in the academic work of the universities.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandcharacter"></a>Final years and character</h2>During his period as vice-chancellor Adrian sometimes expressed hopes of getting back to work in the laboratory. Instead, however, his administrative roles multiplied: he was president of the Research Defence Society, trustee of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation, member of the council of management of the Baring Foundation, British representative on the Council of Scientists' Human Frontier Science Program Organization. In 1990 he took a year's sabbatical leave from the university to become prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company, and in 1992, approaching the age of sixty-five, he retired from both his professorship and the mastership of Pembroke. In 1993 he was appointed deputy lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. In that year he and Lucy were to visit Melbourne, where he had been invited to lecture, but he became ill with an abdominal cancer, from which he died at the Evelyn Hospital, Cambridge, on 4 April 1995. He was buried on 11 April in the churchyard of St Margaret's Church, Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk. A memorial service was held at the church of Great St Mary, Cambridge, on 24 June 1995. There were no children of his marriage, and the peerage became extinct on his death.<br>
<br>It is easier to say what Adrian achieved than what sort of person he was. The portrait by Daphne Todd in the hall at Pembroke is a good likeness but it portrays him as austere and patrician, and he was rarely either. Tall, handsome, and distinguished-looking, with an invariably courteous manner and wide general interests ranging from archaeology and Middle Eastern politics to joinery and English silver, he was genuinely diffident about his own remarkable achievements. And though he confessed to having enjoyed climbing, sailing, skiing, and &#145;driving fast cars fast&#146;, he insisted that &#145;in none of these was I any better than average&#146;  (Adrian, 1981). He was an entertaining companion, with an excellent dry sense of humour. Speaking as prime warden in the gilded magnificence of the newly refurbished Goldsmiths' Hall, he explained to the decorated diners how glad the company was to be back in its own premises: &#145;Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home&#146;. And going through old correspondence, he found copies of a letter written by his father to Lucy's parents at the time of her engagement to Richard. &#145;There were&#146;, he said, &#145;three drafts, each warmer and more spontaneous than the last&#146;. The strength of Adrian's character is perhaps most clearly shown in a long letter to a friend and former colleague, written as he lay dying of cancer. It is devoid of self-pity, concerned for Lucy, detachedly accurate in the clinical aspects, and gently amusing in discussing day-to-day events.<br>
