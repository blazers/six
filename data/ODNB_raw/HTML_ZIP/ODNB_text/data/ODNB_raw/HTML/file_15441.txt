<span class="headword">Keppel,  George</span>, third earl of Albemarle  (1724&#150;1772), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 5 April 1724, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15443/', "William Anne Keppel, second earl of Albemarle (1702&#150;1754)")</script>, and his wife, Anne (1703&#150;1789), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16449/', "Charles Lennox, first duke of Richmond")</script>. Viscount Bury, as he was styled until succeeding his father in 1754, was educated at Westminster School from 1732 to 1740.<br>
<br>Bury followed his father&#151;a notorious spendthrift who left little but debts&#151;into a military career. He made effective use of family connections and his friendship with William, duke of Cumberland, George II's favourite son, whom he had met at Westminster. Entering the Coldstream Guards in 1738 as an ensign, he was a lieutenant-colonel by the time he served as one of Cumberland's aides-de-camp at Fontenoy (1745). At Culloden (1746) he drew the first shots of the battle when Cumberland ordered him forward to reconnoitre the Jacobite artillery; later he was almost killed when the finery of his uniform led an errant highlander to mistake him for the duke and narrowly miss at close range. Bury had the honour of carrying the news of the victory to George II. Bury's career continued to prosper. His uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16450/', "Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond")</script>, returned him to parliament for Chichester in 1746, but he showed little interest in the Commons and continued to rise in the army. He became colonel of the 20th foot (1749), major-general (1756), lieutenant-general (1759), colonel of the King's Own dragoons (1755), and privy councillor and governor of Jersey (1761). A lord of the bedchamber to Cumberland from 1746, his loyalty to his patron was fierce.<br>
<br>In 1760 Albemarle (as he had become in 1754) accepted a challenge from General George Townshend that arose in part from the latter's caricatures of the duke (the duel was averted by the intervention of another officer). After Cumberland died in 1765, Albemarle was named his executor by George III who instructed him to &#145;destroy everything that his uncle &hellip; might have desired to keep concealed&#146;  (Whitworth, 238). To the regret of later historians Albemarle effectively culled the duke's papers of politically sensitive material.<br>
<br>Albemarle's success at advancing his military career through connections at court drew criticism from some contemporaries. Wolfe lumped him with his father as &#145;showy men who are seen in palaces and the courts of Kings &hellip; They have a way of trifling with us poor soldiers that gives many honest, poor men high disgust&#146;  (Wright, 185&#150;6). Horace Walpole characterized him as &#145;ambitious, greedy, and a dexterous courtier&#146;  (Walpole, 2.221).<br>
<br>During the Seven Years' War Albemarle declined offers to command the St Malo and Martinique expeditions. In 1762 he accepted command of the land forces sent to take Havana. The expedition also included his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15439/', "Augustus Keppel")</script>, second in command of the naval forces, and William, a major-general in the army. Albemarle organized a successful landing on 7 June 1762 and forced Havana's surrender on 12 August, though some historians have criticized the slowness that resulted from his reliance on conventional siege warfare. While losing relatively few men to Spanish arms, Albemarle suffered near crippling losses from disease: of 5366 men lost by the army (whose total strength was about 16,000) from 7 June to 9 October 1762, 4708 died from disease. Though Cuba was usefully exchanged for the Floridas in the peace settlement, the losses incurred greatly reduced the manpower available to meet the challenge of Pontiac's rising in North America in 1763&#150;4. This experience probably contributed to the decision to maintain a larger military establishment in the colonies and to seek new sources of revenue to support it. Albemarle's subsequent governorship of Cuba proved controversial. He deported the bishop of Havana for non-co-operation and provoked criticism from merchants who complained (with reason) that he imposed illegal taxes on them. Albemarle himself received more than &pound;122,000 in prize money. In recognition of his triumph George III awarded him the Garter in 1765.<br>
<br>After his return from Cuba, Albemarle became increasingly involved in politics. As Cumberland re-emerged as a figure of importance in the early part of George III's reign, Albemarle frequently acted as his point of contact with the political world and followed his patron into supporting the first Rockingham administration in 1765. After Cumberland's death Albemarle gave his allegiance to the Rockingham whigs and went into opposition with them in 1766. Albemarle was generally regarded as one of the party leaders, though his efforts to foster a union in 1766&#150;7 with the duke of Bedford's followers failed. He never fully recovered his health after his return from Cuba, and his political involvement in his later years was limited by periodic bouts of ill health. Perhaps his greatest contribution to his party was to bring his brother Admiral Augustus Keppel into its ranks. His brother's court martial and acquittal in 1779 made him one of the whig political heroes of the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>Albemarle married relatively late: on 20 April 1770, at Bagshot Park, Windlesham, Surrey, he married Ann (<i>bap</i>. 1743, <i>d</i>. 1824), youngest daughter of Sir John Miller, baronet, of Chichester and his wife, Susan Combe. They had one child, William Charles Keppel (1772&#150;1849), who succeeded to the earldom. Albemarle also had two children with his mistress, Sarah Stanley. He died (&#145;very rich&#146;, according to Lady Mary Coke) of &#145;the old complaint in his bowels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 4.131) on 13 October 1772, and was buried on 22 October at Quidenham, Norfolk, an estate bought with prize money from the capture of Havana. Rockingham mourned him to Burke as &#145;so honourable, so worthy and so kind a friend&#146;  (27 Oct 1772, Burke, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.348).<br>
