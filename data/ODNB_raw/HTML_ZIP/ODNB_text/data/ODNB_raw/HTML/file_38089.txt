<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vardon,  Henry William <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1870&#150;1937), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born at Marais, Grouville, Jersey, on 9 May 1870, one of eight children of Philippe George Vardon, a gardener, and his wife, Elizabeth Augustine Bouchard. Harry, as he was always known, did little at school, but was drawn to golf when the course for the Royal Jersey Golf Club was laid out near his home in 1878. With friends he took up the game in a rough, ready, yet committed way and worked occasionally as a caddy. He left school aged just twelve, working first on a farm, then in the service of a local doctor, before being employed in 1887 as a gardener by Major Spofforth, captain of the Royal Jersey Golf Club. Spofforth encouraged the young man's golf, and Vardon quickly became the leading local artisan player.<br>
<br>In 1890 Vardon was appointed professional to a new course established at Studley Royal, Yorkshire, prompted by his younger brother, Tom, himself an accomplished golfer who had already moved to the mainland. He quickly tired of the limited opportunities there and moved across the Pennines to Bury in Lancashire, where he was the professional until in 1896 he moved again to Ganton. He first entered the open championship in 1893 and gave warning of his ability by finishing sixth the following year. It was in 1896 that Vardon broke through to the highest level. He began by comfortably beating J. H. Taylor, open champion in 1894 and 1895, in an exhibition match before going on to win the open himself at Muirfield, beating Taylor in a play-off. He was to win the open five more times (at Prestwick in 1898, 1903, and 1914, and at Sandwich in 1899 and 1911), a feat still unmatched in 2000, and came second on four other occasions. In 1900 he won the US open championship, coming second on the two other occasions he entered&#151;most famously in a play-off to the young local amateur Francis Ouimet at Brookline in 1913 but also notably when aged fifty. Other significant successes came at the inaugural German open in 1911 and the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> match play championship the following year at Sunningdale.<br>
<br>The so-called &#145;triumvirate&#146; of Vardon, Taylor, and James Braid dominated golf in Britain in the twenty years before the First World War, though the absolute peak of Vardon's golf was played between 1898 and 1903. After his second open victory his &#145;long-sustained spell of first-class form [was] little short of phenomenal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Golf</span>, 17/427, 16 Sept 1898, 22), and in 1899 he was judged virtually unbeatable, going &#145;up and down the country winning tournaments and breaking records, trampling down all opponents in his juggernaut stride&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 March 1937, 14). He was styled by some the Napoleon of Golf, more commonly the Greyhound. Such supremacy bore witness to a natural athleticism allied to an iron will. He practised assiduously until he had mastered every shot and on the course was &#145;Gifted with a rare control of himself which nothing could ruffle&#146;  (Taylor, 89), his powerful concentration allowing him &#145;to sink into the game&#146;  (Kirkaldy, 137). He championed two major innovations of technique: first, the use of the overlapping grip which had been developed some years before, such that it is now universally called the &#145;Vardon grip&#146;, and second, a much more upright swing than that favoured by the hitherto dominant Scots players, probably allowing him to hit down the line longer than most. His ball striking was rhythmic, authoritative, and pure; from both tee and fairway the straightness of his hitting was legendary. Bernard Darwin, the great observer of the game, could not &#145;imagine anybody hitting the ball better than Harry Vardon&#146;  (Darwin, 159).<br>
<br>Vardon's supremacy could not last for ever, but its end was hastened by two factors. While winning at Prestwick in 1903 his health broke down seriously from tuberculosis. He spent many months recovering at Mundesley Sanatorium in Norfolk, and though he returned to competitive golf in 1904 ill health often dogged him thereafter. Second, his putting became highly erratic. If this had never been the strongest part of his game, after the turn of the century it became his undoing. In today's language he probably suffered from the &#145;yips&#146;, causing him to stab or jerk at short putts, though he himself believed it was caused by an old footballing injury to his right hand. After 1920 his game fell away markedly and he concentrated on teaching at the South Hertfordshire club at Totteridge, which he had joined as professional in 1902 and served happily until his death.<br>
<br>In his prime Vardon was a great sporting figure, akin in stature to the cricketer W. G. Grace. He was, indeed, both a beneficiary of and a stimulus to the first great era of the growth of golf in England and the United States. An expanding middle class, with increasing amounts of time and money to spare, was embracing the game as never before, and a large railway network enabled thousands of spectators to witness championships and exhibition matches. That he was counted as an Englishman (although born and brought up in Jersey) challenging the Scots at their own game only added to the sense of occasion&#151;most piquantly in his famous challenge match against Willie Park jun. in 1899. Vardon was well aware of golf's widening appeal. He criss-crossed Britain and parts of Ireland and France, and made three long trips to North America, taking the game to old and new audiences by playing against other champions, local professionals, and leading amateurs. The effort in this was immense (and may have contributed to his ill health), yet he lost very rarely indeed. As a counterpart to this evangelicalism he also designed fourteen golf courses, several of them associated with flourishing polite resorts, as at Llandrindod Wells, or prosperous suburbs, as at Sandy Lodge. He reached a wider audience still by publishing successfully on the game. <span class="italic">The Complete Golfer</span> went through thirteen editions from 1905 before a revised edition was issued in 1914. <span class="italic">How to Play Golf</span> was published in 1912 and was followed by a chapter on driving in <span class="italic">Success at Golf</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Progressive Golf</span> (1922), and <span class="italic">My Golfing Life</span> (1933). If these books are clear and effective, there is a hint of regret in each, perhaps for what might have been, but also at the introduction after 1900 of the modern rubber or Haskell ball, which he strongly believed had made the game less skilful.<br>
<br>Golf was Vardon's life. Like many champions he had a prodigious determination. Yet to his peers there was little that was selfish or distant about him. Taylor noticed that he was &#145;Kindly and considerate and without harshness, he looked upon the world with tolerance and understanding&#146;  (Taylor, 117). Whether his wife agreed is uncertain. He married Jessie Bryant (1869/70&#150;1946), an ironer of St Helier, Jersey, the daughter of John Bryant, ginger beer maker, on 15 November 1891 when she was already pregnant. Vardon was in England when his son, Clarence Henry, was born in June 1892, but saw the child die on 5 August. He was unable to persuade his wife to join him in England until 1896, but soon after their reunion she suffered a miscarriage. The marriage was to remain childless and appears to have been a detached one, his wife showing little interest in his achievements or in any social life. In the 1920s, after he had given up hope of further golfing triumphs, Vardon found some comfort with Gladys Matilda (Tilly) Howell (1892&#150;1963), a dancer, with whom he had a son, Peter, born on 23 January 1926  (Howell).<br>
<br>Vardon died at his home, 14 Totteridge Lane, Totteridge, near London, on 20 March 1937 and was buried in St Andrew's parish church, Totteridge, four days later. <span class="italic">The Times</span> quickly published an obituary that was unstinting in its praise. &#145;He did what only a very great player can do; he raised the general conception of what was possible in his game and forced his nearest rivals to attain a higher standard by attempting that which they would otherwise have deemed impossible&#146;. At his funeral, homage was paid by Taylor, Braid, Ted Ray, and Sandy Herd, between them winners of twelve open championships and two US open championships.<br>
