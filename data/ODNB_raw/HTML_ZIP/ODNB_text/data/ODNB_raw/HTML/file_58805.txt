<span class="headword">Hodgson,  Leonard</span>  (1889&#150;1969), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 24 October 1889, at Fulham, the son of Walter Hodgson (1853&#150;1934), official shorthand writer to the House of Commons, and Lillias Emma (<i>b</i>. 1859), daughter of William Shaw of Wolsingham, co. Durham. He was a scholar at St Paul's School, London, winning a scholarship to Hertford College, Oxford, where he gained firsts in both Greats and theology. He was ordained deacon in 1913 after a year at St Michael's College, Llandaff, which began a long association with Wales. He later served on the council of St David's College, Lampeter, and declined the offer of the bishopric of Monmouth. After a curacy at St Mark's, Portsmouth, he became vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1914 through the influence of his former tutor, H. H. Williams, who had become principal. He was awarded honorary fellowships there and at Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1957. He was examining chaplain to the bishop of Lichfield from 1917 to 1925, and to the bishop of Winchester from 1932 to 1939.<br>
<br>In 1919 Hodgson became dean of divinity and tutor in theology at Magdalen College, Oxford, and on 7 April 1920 married Ethel Margaret du Plat (1888&#150;1960), daughter of Charles Frederick Archer, rector of Moy, co. Tyrone. They had one son and one daughter. In 1917 he had proposed in vain to the novelist Dorothy L. Sayers, who, although calling him &#145;a perfectly delightful padre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.130), spurned what soon became an infatuation. In 1925 he published <span class="italic">The Place of Reason in Christian Apologetic</span>, which provided the basis for his future work. The creeds, he held, were &#145;a rational construction&#146; which tried to say &#145;something about the universe without ignoring the problem presented by the appearance of Jesus Christ upon the pages of this world's history&#146;  (p. 41). This book was based on lectures given at the General Theological Seminary, New York, where he was appointed professor of Christian apologetics in 1925, and which later made him an honorary STD in 1931. In 1928 he published <span class="italic">And Was Made Man</span> on the relationship between the gospels and Christology, and in 1929 his first collection, <span class="italic">Essays in Christian Philosophy</span>, where, against both Hegelianism and positivism, he elaborated his philosophical position which emphasized both the rational character of revelation and the importance of experience: it was &#145;God's will&#146; that man &#145;should think&#146;  (p. 168). He returned to New York in 1936 to give the Paddock lectures, published as <span class="italic">The Grace of God in Faith and Philosophy</span>, his most developed account of the relationship between the critical synthesis of philosophy and the rational insight of theology: Christian philosophy was &#145;the attempt to interpret the meaning of all things in the light of God's self-revelation in Christ&#146;  (p. 20). He was a canon of Winchester from 1931 until his election as regius professor of moral and pastoral theology and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1938. At Christ Church he gave lectures beyond the theology faculty (published in 1952 as <span class="italic">Christian Faith and Practice</span>) that attracted large numbers of undergraduates. During the 1930s he became a keen ecumenist, serving on the Anglican Council on Foreign Relations and as theological and general secretary of the Edinburgh world conference on faith and order in 1937, editing the proceedings (<span class="italic">The Second World Conference on Faith and Order</span>). The conference took an ambiguous stand on the situation in Germany, refusing to condemn the German government which had deprived delegates from the evangelical churches of their passports. Hodgson also wrote a number of pamphlets on ecclesiology and Anglicanism, criticizing what he regarded as the authoritarian theology of Karl Barth and Emil Brunner. His theology developed in more systematic directions with the publication of his Edinburgh Croall lectures, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1944): although mysterious, the Trinity was &#145;not an irrational mystery&#146;  (p. 95).<br>
<br>In 1944 Hodgson succeeded Oliver Chase Quick (who had been a significant influence on him) as regius professor of divinity; he retained this position until his retirement in 1958, declining the offer of the bishopric of Carlisle soon after the Second World War. Despite his severe appearance and staccato speech, he was an inspiring and popular lecturer on the international scene. He was made an Oxford BD and DD in 1938, an honorary DCL of Bishop's University, Lennoxville, Canada, in 1929, and an honorary DD of Edinburgh in 1938 and Glasgow in 1956. It was in Glasgow that he delivered his Gifford lectures, <span class="italic">For Faith and Freedom</span>, from 1955 to 1957, which again investigated the relationship between faith and philosophy. From 1954 until 1966 he was warden of William Temple College, Rugby; there representatives of industry, psychiatrists, sociologists, and theologians were brought together. His book <span class="italic">Sex and Christian Freedom</span> (1967) was the fruit of such conversations, in which he sought to &#145;talk twentieth-century common sense without being disloyal to our ordination vows&#146;  (p. 8). He died on 15 July 1969 at his home, 34 Newbold Terrace, Leamington Spa, and was buried in Epwell churchyard, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Although Hodgson was original neither as a philosopher nor as a theologian, he stressed the fundamental agreement of philosophy and theology, retaining a great sense of the intelligibility and purposiveness of the universe. He communicated a dynamic, rational and attractive theology to a wide audience both at home and abroad. His focus on the interaction between the material and the spiritual, between grace and freedom, as &#145;the obverse and reverse sides of a single process&#146;  (Hodgson, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, 48), helped shape English theology's continuing concern with the reconciliation of modern science and the claims of religion.<br>
