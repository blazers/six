<span class="headword">MacDonald family</span> <span class="st"> [MacDhomnaill, MacDonald de Ile]</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;<em>c.</em>1500), <span class="occ">magnates</span>, ruled a semi-independent lordship or kingdom in the west coast and islands of Scotland, with the title <i>r&iacute; Innse Gall</i> (&#145;king of the Hebrides&#146;) or <i>dominus insularum</i> (&#145;lord of the Isles&#146;). The titles appear to have been interchangeable, depending on which language was used. As late as 1549 a writer could refer to the &#145;lord of the Isles ore as the heighland men calls him king of the Isles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monro's Description</span>, 92).<h2>
<a name="TheMacDonaldsandthelordshipoftheIsles"></a>The MacDonalds and the lordship of the Isles</h2>Descended from Somerled, king of the Isles and lord of Argyll (<i>d</i>. 1164), the MacDonalds ruled over the varied and scattered series of communities stretching at the height of their power from the Butt of Lewis to the Mull of Kintyre, and linked by an intricate web of sea lanes through which their galleys could move widely in peace and in war. Their mainland territories were held from the king of Scots, and the islands (until they were ceded to Scotland under the treaty of Perth in 1266) from the king of Norway. The family separated into three great divisions&#151;the MacDonalds based in Islay, the MacDougalls of Lorn, and the MacRuairis, whose lands of Garmoran by the fourteenth century, at least, extended from Moidart to Barra and the Uists. Overlordship passed by turns among the three kindreds, but the MacDougalls, by taking the Balliol side in the wars of independence owing to a Comyn relationship, lost in both land and influence, while the others supported Robert I and prospered.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54281"></a><span class="headword">Angus MacDonald</span> <span class="st"> [Angus  &Oacute;g MacDonald]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1314<span class="mult">x</span>18), <span class="occ">king of the Hebrides</span>, was of Islay kindred. With his supporters he helped to win victory over the English at Bannockburn and was rewarded with lands in Lochaber, Ardnamurchan, Morvern, Duror, and Glencoe. He married an Irish chief's daughter, Aine Ni Cathan, and (as well as a daughter, Mary, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54311/', "William Ross, fifth earl of Ross")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54308/', "Ross family")</script>]) had a son, <a name="cosubject_17435"></a><span class="headword">John MacDonald</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1387)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded his father as king of the Hebrides, and was the first of four members of the family known to have adopted the designation <i>dominus insularum</i>, which he used in a letter to Edward III of England in 1336. His lands, with the custody of the royal castles of Cairnburgh Mor and Beg in the Treshnish Isles off Mull and Dunchonnuil in the Garvellochs, were confirmed to him by David II in 1343, and he consolidated the power of clan Donald over the other descendants of Somerled. This process was assisted by his two marriages, for which he obtained papal dispensations in 1337 and 1350 respectively. His first wife was Amie, sister of Ruairi of Garmoran, on whose death in 1346 she inherited all his lands, which were then joined with John's territories in Kintyre, Islay, and Mull, while the clan Ruairi was absorbed into clan Donald. In 1354 the possessions of John and his kinsman John (MacDougall) of Lorn were divided under an agreement that emphasized the latter's subordinate position. With Amie MacRuair, John had three sons, including Ranald (or Reginald) from whom the MacDonalds of Clanranald and Glengarry are descended.<br>
<br>John MacDonald's second wife was Margaret, daughter of Robert Stewart (who became king as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II")</script> in 1371), and, while the MacRuairi lands went to Amie's son, it was <a name="cosubject_17430"></a><span class="headword">Donald MacDonald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1420<span class="mult">x</span>25)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of his father's marriage to Margaret Stewart, who succeeded as second lord of the Isles &#145;with the consent of his brethren and the nobles of the Isles&#146; according to one family annalist, &#145;but contrary to the opinion of the men of the Isles&#146;  (Cameron, 161). As well as their own kindred, the lordship now comprised great clans like the Macleans and MacLeods, and lesser ones such as the MacKinnons and MacQuarries, and both groups had a share in the administration as well as in the territory of the Isles. Three of Donald's charters apparently composed in feudal form to his brother-in-law Lachlan Maclean of Duart (1390) and one to his nephew Hector Maclean (1409) are known through later crown confirmations; but the most singular survival in the original manuscript is the only specimen of a charter of the lord of the Isles (here signing McDomhnaill with no other designation) in the Gaelic language and traditional phrasing, granting lands in Islay to Brian Vicar Mackay in 1408. Donald's marriage to Mary, a daughter of Euphemia, countess of Ross in her own right, and her husband, Sir Walter Leslie, led to a claim to the Ross earldom in which Donald was opposed by the powerful Albany family, leading to the memorable but indecisive battle of Harlaw (1411) near Aberdeen.<h2>
<a name="EarlsofRoss"></a>Earls of Ross</h2>Although the earldom remained in the hands of the crown after the elimination of the Albany Stewarts in 1425, Donald's son and successor <a name="cosubject_17419"></a><span class="headword">Alexander MacDonald</span>, twelfth earl of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1449)<span class="occ"></span>, styled himself &#145;lord of the isles and master [heirs] of the earldom of Ross&#146;  (Munro and Munro, 34) in a charter dated at Finlaggan (where he had a &#145;mansion&#146; on an island in the loch) in 1427, while his mother was still living. The third lord of the Isles, Alexander, was one of the highland chiefs arrested when James I came to Inverness in 1428, but though taken to Perth he managed to escape, gathered his forces, and faced a royal army in Lochaber where he gave himself up without a battle, and after a humiliating submission at Edinburgh, &#145;clad only in short and drawers&#146;  (Bower, 8.488&#150;90), in August 1429, was imprisoned in Tantallon Castle. In Alexander's absence his cousins Donald Balloch and Alasdair Carrach carried on the rebellion, and after their defeat of the king's army at Inverlochy in 1431, terms were agreed and Alexander was released. He kept within the law thereafter and co-operated with the crown, and shortly before the death of James I was issuing charters as fully established twelfth earl of Ross. He administered the lordship and earldom as a single unit, with one council including leading men of his own kin and other clans from both areas; and for a time he was justiciar north of the Forth. But his loyalty was less than wholehearted, if it was he who entered into an offensive and defensive league with the earls of Douglas and Crawford in 1445&#150;6, with serious consequences that followed in the next generation. However, no evidence exists as to exactly which earls of Douglas, Ross, and Crawford were involved, nor of the contents of the bond, which may never have been written down. The only exact date assigned to the bond, 7 March 1445, comes from an unreliable seventeenth-century source, while 1450&#150;51 has also been suggested, when Douglas was already threatened by James II, and Alexander's son was out of favour because of his Livingston connections.<br>
<br>Alexander MacDonald had a wife, Elizabeth (apparently a Haliburton of Dirleton, and not a Seton as has been supposed), but his sons Celestine of Lochalsh and Hugh of Sleat, whose descendants were to claim succession to the lordship, were not the children of any recorded marriage. His daughter, Florence, was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73418/', "Farquhar Mackintosh")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70946/', "Mackintosh family (per. c.1491&#150;1606)")</script>]. A Ross chronicle says that Alexander died at Dingwall on 9 May 1449, and was buried at the chanonry of Ross (Fortrose). His successor, as fourth lord of the Isles and thirteenth earl of Ross, was his lawful son <a name="cosubject_17436"></a><span class="headword">John MacDonald</span>  (<em>c.</em>1434&#150;1503)<span class="occ"></span>, possibly still a minor. John's early marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of James Livingston of Callendar (<i>d</i>. 1467), chamberlain of Scotland, apparently took place with James II's encouragement shortly before her father's imprisonment in 1450, from which he escaped and took refuge with his son-in-law. The exact chronology of events is unclear, but it seems that John's revolt, during which he took the royal castles of Inverness, Urquhart, and Ruthven, strengthening the two former and demolishing the latter, took place on Livingston's behalf in the spring of 1451, when the king was already threatening the Douglases. This revolt was probably one of the causes, rather than the result, of the killing of the earl of Douglas on 22 February 1452, for which the bond between Douglas and MacDonald was the immediate excuse. There was no northern rising after the slaying, though raids in the Clyde region by John's cousin Donald Balloch may have taken place at this time at the request of the new earl of Douglas. James Livingston recovered his lands and office before the middle of 1454, as the king tried to build up support against the Douglases. The castles of Inverness and Urquhart were granted to Livingston for three years, and then to the lord of the Isles for life.<h2>
<a name="Theendofthelordship"></a>The end of the lordship</h2>The minority of James III saw unrest in Lorn and renewed pressure from the exiled earl of Douglas, who was used by the Yorkists in England when on the look-out for allies in the Wars of the Roses. Douglas promoted a treaty with John of the Isles (Donald Balloch and his son John being also associated) and Edward IV of England in 1461&#150;2, by which the two Scots as vassals of King Edward agreed to divide Scotland between them. Three years later, after John had ravaged Inverness, a fifteen-year truce between the Scots and English left him free to make his peace with James III's government. When the truce with England was converted to a peace in 1474, the terms of the treaty of Westminster&#150;Ardtornish (as it has been called) came to light, and John was forfeited, but on his renouncing the earldom of Ross, the lordships of Kintyre and Knapdale, and the sheriffships of Inverness and Nairn, he was pardoned, reinstated in 1476 in his other lands, and created a lord of parliament as lord of the Isles. Thereafter his hold on the lordship was uneasy. His only son, <a name="cosubject_54282"></a><span class="headword">Angus MacDonald</span> <span class="st"> [Angus  &Oacute;g MacDonald]</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1490)<span class="occ"></span>, rebelled against his father, and was supported by leaders of clan Donald, but after a sea battle at Bloody Bay off Mull they were reconciled. John still failed to control his people, and was finally forfeited in 1493, after a further rebellion led by his nephew Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh. The former lord of the Isles died as a pensioner of the royal court while the king was at Dundee in 1503, survived by his wife and a daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Angus MacDonald, who had been recognized as his heir in 1476 and was using the style &#145;master of the Isles&#146; in 1485, died before his father, allegedly murdered by an Irish harper at Inverness in 1490. Having married a daughter of the first earl of Argyll, Angus left a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69918/', "Donald Dubh MacDonald")</script>, who spent many years in prison, but during brief spells of freedom attempted to rally support for a revival of the island lordship until his death in Ireland in 1545. His efforts were doomed to failure, and with the ending of this hope there expired any prospect of a permanent and independent centre of Gaelic power and culture surviving on the &#145;Celtic fringe&#146; of the Scottish realm.<br>
<br>The lords of the Isles were unlike the other magnates of late medieval Scotland. The feudal elements introduced by the MacDonalds had some features that could combine easily with the Gaelic concept of a kin-based society, but embodied others that were hostile to it. A major difference lay in succession practices, with primogeniture replacing the former pattern by which the headship of the kindred alternated among the leaders of the three divisions of the descendants of Somerled. The lords of the Isles adopted the feudal practice, but after 1493 there was a revival of the old system, leading to much confusion and bloodshed. On the other hand, landholding was readily translatable into feudal terms, with galleys being required in place of knight service. The church and the law were supported, and the lords had a council to advise them, making it plausible to say in retrospect that &#145;in their time there was great peace and wealth in the Isles through the ministration of justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monro's Description</span>, 57). Compared with the period of anarchy that followed the forfeiture, this was a time when the arts could flourish; the sculptured stones and crosses scattered widely around the west highlands and islands, and the bardic verse composed in the same period, notably by a number of generations of the MacMhuirich family and others whose work appears in the <span class="roman">Book of the Dean of Lismore</span>, alike survive as a reminder of what was looked back upon as a golden age.<br>
