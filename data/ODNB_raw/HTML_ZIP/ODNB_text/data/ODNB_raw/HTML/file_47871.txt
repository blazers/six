<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Ian Wilson</span>  (1907&#150;1989), <span class="occ">accountant and banker</span>, was born on 28 May 1907 at Cumnock, Ayrshire, the son of Alexander Buchanan Macdonald, minister of religion, and Mary Bowman Wilson, doctor of medicine. His only brother died in infancy. His very early childhood was spent in Ayrshire, but the family soon moved to Perthshire, where his mother was medical officer for Perthshire schools during the First World War. Macdonald's school education was begun at Perth Academy and completed at Edinburgh Academy. To complete the triangle he went to Glasgow University. Thereafter he served his apprenticeship as a chartered accountant with the Glasgow firm of Kerr, Macleod, and Macfarlan, and qualified in 1930. Three years later his firm assumed him as a partner; and it was then that he married Helen, daughter of James Nicholson, a Glasgow rubber and paint manufacturer. They had three children.<br>
<br>Macdonald's busy career in professional practice brought him into contact with a wide range of businesses and business people. Yet he also kept his academic contacts, and in 1938 he was appointed to the part-time chair in accountancy at Glasgow University. He held this post until 1950. In 1945 he became joint auditor of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, and two years later he joined the bank's board as non-executive director. A failure in planned succession led him to be offered the general manager's job in 1953. The appointment of a chartered accountant to the top job in a bank was somewhat controversial.<br>
<br>Macdonald was &#145;an energetic man of progressive views&#146;, who &#145;thrived on change&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Jan 1989). He devised a three-point strategy for the future of the bank, which included growth by diversification of the business, amalgamation, and the development of a merchant bank. In 1954 Macdonald became the first British banker to acquire a hire-purchase company. He had not thought it necessary to consult the Bank of England, who were somewhat lukewarm to the idea of banks diversifying in this way. However, four years later, in under three months, all the English and Scottish clearing banks purchased stakes in finance houses dealing in hire purchase. Another progressive idea, which came to fruition in Edinburgh only in 1964, was for a ladies' branch.<br>
<br>It took a little longer for Macdonald to achieve his second objective, amalgamation, but in 1959 the Commercial Bank of Scotland acquired the National Bank of Scotland in a share exchange deal with its owner, Lloyds Bank, who retained 36 per cent in the new National Commercial Bank of Scotland. The sizeable hire-purchase interests of the National Commercial and Lloyds were combined and traded for many years as Lloyds and Scottish. Macdonald became chairman not only of the National Commercial Bank, but also of Lloyds and Scottish. The youngest bank chairman in Britain, his progression from general manager to chairman was &#145;unique in the field of British banking&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Jan 1989). Macdonald also became a director of Lloyds Bank. By the late 1960s the growth of industry and commerce dictated the logic of further mergers among the banks, and Macdonald worked hard to secure a merger with one of Scotland's oldest, but smaller banks, the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Royal Bank name was used for the operating arm of the merged bank, and Macdonald served as chairman from the date of the merger in 1969 until 1972. The holding company from 1969 to 1979 was the National Commercial Bank of Scotland Group Ltd, and Macdonald was deputy chairman from 1969 until 1978.<br>
<br>Macdonald was less successful in his third aim of building a merchant bank. In 1964 National Commercial and Schroeders Ltd was set up, with Macdonald as chairman, but its growth was modest and Macdonald himself considered this venture something of a black mark on his career. Despite an exceptionally busy life with the Commercial Bank, Macdonald was able to serve on other boards including that of United Biscuits. His public service included membership of a number of government committees, including the committees of investigation and courts of inquiry into port transport (1945), shipbuilding (1947), fishing (1957&#150;60), and ports and harbours (1961&#150;2). He was also on the General Claims Tribunal (1943&#150;58), the South of Scotland Electricity Board (1956&#150;61), and the Civil Aviation Authority (1972&#150;5). Macdonald retired from the boards of public companies at the age of seventy, and pursued his retirement interests as chairman of the Scottish Hospitals Endowment Research Trust, and as a member of the review body on doctors' and dentists' remuneration.<br>
<br>Described in the <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary as &#145;modest and unpretentious&#146;, Macdonald had &#145;a dour style, alleviated by dry humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Jan 1989). As a son of the manse he retained his membership of the Church of Scotland, and was for many years an elder in the kirk session of St Giles's Cathedral, Edinburgh, where he also served as church treasurer. His recreational interests included shooting, fishing, and golf; he was a member of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers at Muirfield, and the Caledonian Club (London).<br>
<br>Macdonald played a leading role in the transformation of Scottish banking. Although his wide-ranging policies often made him seem an <i>enfant terrible</i>, they had a lasting influence at a time when post-war financial controls were yielding to competitive and rationalized banking. Macdonald died at Edington Cottage Hospital, North Berwick, on 8 January 1989. He was survived by his wife.<br>
