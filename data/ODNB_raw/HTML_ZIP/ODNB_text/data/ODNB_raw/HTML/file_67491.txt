<span class="headword">McKenna <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cnockaert]</span>,  Marthe</span>  (1892&#150;<em>c.</em>1969), <span class="occ">spy</span>, was born in Westrosebeke, Belgium, one of five children of Felix Cnockaert, farmer, and his wife. Although many details of her family remain obscure, it appears that both parents were Belgian and that she had three brothers and one sister.<br>
<br>Prior to the outbreak of the First World War Marthe studied at the medical school of Ghent University. Her education was interrupted by the invasion of Belgium by German forces in 1914, which occurred while she was visiting her family. Marthe remained with her parents and was in Westrosebeke when it was overrun by enemy forces. She volunteered her services as a nurse at an emergency hospital set up in the village to treat German and allied soldiers, and was allowed to remain there even after all other villagers had been removed from the area. Marthe was especially valued by the German authorities for her ability to speak fluent English and German, as well as French and Flemish.<br>
<br>Early in 1915 Marthe was sent to Roeselare, north-east of Ypres, where she was reunited with her parents and where she continued to work as a nurse at a military hospital. At this time she was approached by an old family friend, Lucelle Deldonck, who revealed herself as an agent for British intelligence and who wanted to recruit Marthe into espionage work for the allies. For almost two years Marthe used her position in the hospital and her proximity to German soldiers in a caf&eacute; in Roeselare purchased by her parents to gather information on troop movements, artillery concentrations, locations of supply dumps, and other strategic concerns. This information was then passed on through a network of Belgian agents, a number of whom were women. In many cases these women, Marthe included, also aided in the escape of allied prisoners.<br>
<br>After being involved in the destruction of an ammunition dump Marthe was arrested on espionage charges in November 1916 and sentenced to death. This sentence was later commuted to life in prison when it was discovered she had been awarded the Iron Cross by the German government for her nursing services. She then spent the remainder of the war in very poor conditions in a prison in Ghent.<br>
<br>All of Marthe's immediate family survived the war, although two of her brothers were permanent invalids due to war injuries. While Marthe herself was recovering from her ordeal in prison she learned that she had been mentioned in dispatches on 8 November 1918 by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in recognition of her intelligence work; for this she was given a certificate by the British government noting her &#145;gallant and distinguished services in the Field&#146; and signed by the secretary of state for war, Winston Churchill  (McKenna, 4). The French and Belgian governments both made her a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. After receiving her demobilization papers and prison pay from British intelligence Marthe returned to Westrosebeke for the first time after the war, where she met a British army officer, John McKenna (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1962), whom she married shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>Marthe McKenna and her husband apparently moved to Manchester following the war, but later returned to Belgium, settling in the rebuilt family home in Westrosebeke. In 1931 an English writer travelling in Belgium happened upon the McKennas and, hearing about her war work, encouraged Marthe to record her story in English for publication. The result was the memoir <span class="italic">I was a Spy!</span>, ghost-written by her husband and published in 1932, with a glowingly complimentary forward written by Churchill. It was subsequently made into a popular film by Victor Saville, which starred Madeleine Carroll as Marthe.<br>
<br>Following this well-received volume and a collection of espionage anecdotes published in 1934, the McKennas switched to producing spy fiction under Marthe's name&#151;publishing over a dozen novels and numerous short stories between the mid-1930s and the early 1950s. Ironically (but perhaps not surprisingly) while the details of these stories often drew on Marthe's wartime experiences, the plots tended to stick to the more familiar format of the day in which the hero was typically male (and English) and women appeared as loyal sidekicks and love interests, damsels in distress, or seductive villains.<br>
<br>It is difficult to determine the extent to which Marthe McKenna was personally responsible for the numerous works of spy fiction published under her name. Given the nature of the prose and their stylistic similarity to other popular contemporary British thrillers, it is likely that John McKenna was largely responsible for the actual writing. The absence of any publications under Marthe's name after 1951 appears to coincide roughly with the point at which their marriage ended unhappily. Marthe McKenna then lived a secluded life in Westrosebeke until her death, which took place about 1969.<br>
<br>Although details about many aspects of her life are scarce and her status as an author is uncertain, Marthe McKenna should be recognized for her contributions as an intelligence agent during the First World War, when most modern intelligence services were still in their infancy. Completely inexperienced in such work, she pursued her activities under undeniably dangerous circumstances and paid a heavy price when caught. Her efforts put her in the company of a select group of women agents of the period whose achievements and experiences are only beginning to receive serious attention within the broader field of the history of intelligence operations.<br>
