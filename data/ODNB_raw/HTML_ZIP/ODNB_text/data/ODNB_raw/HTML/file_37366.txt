<span class="headword">Donald III</span> <span class="st"> [Domnall B&aacute;n, Donalbane]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1040, <em>d.</em> 1099?), <span class="occ">king of Scots</span>, was born before, probably not long before, August 1040, when his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8209/', "Duncan I, king of Scots")</script>, was killed in battle &#145;at an immature age&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.581). His mother was a Suthen, of unknown origin, and he had an elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17859/', "Malcolm III")</script>. Another reputed brother, Mael Muire, is attested only by <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, and the relationship should be viewed with scepticism. Some physical characteristic presumably gave rise to the Gaelic name Domnall B&aacute;n, meaning Donald the Fair, by which he was commonly known. On his father's death and the succession of Macbeth (<i>d</i>. 1057), Donald presumably fled, and nothing is known of him during the reigns of Macbeth and Malcolm III.<br>
<br>On Malcolm's death, and that of Edward, the eldest son of his marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18044/', "Margaret")</script>, daughter of Edward &AElig;theling (<i>d</i>. 1057), at Alnwick on 13 November 1093, the Scots chose Donald to be their king. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8210/', "Duncan II")</script>, Malcolm's eldest son of his first marriage, had lived in Normandy and England for twenty years, and was associated with Anglo-Norman culture; there was almost certainly a reaction also against Margaret (who died within a week), her sons (whom Donald exiled), and English immigrants.<br>
<br>Hence when Duncan II, with the help of William II, expelled Donald after six months in 1094, Duncan was unable to retain the throne, being forced to send his French knights packing, and then being killed when Donald returned, aided, it seems, by Edmund, second son of Malcolm III and Margaret. Edmund seems to have been given a share of the kingdom, and, if Donald had no son, may have been his intended successor.<br>
<br>Although Donald made no known attack on northern England (the usual means by which a new king of Scots rewarded his followers), William II set about destabilizing his rule, first recognizing <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8464/', "Edgar (d. 1107)")</script>, the oldest surviving son of Malcolm III, as king in exile, then sending north Edgar &AElig;theling to put Edgar on the throne (1097). According to William of Malmesbury, Donald was killed by David, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David I")</script> (<i>r</i>. 1124&#150;53). To be preferred is the Scottish king-list, which claims that Donald was captured and blinded by King Edgar, dying in Rescobie, in Angus; the annals of Tigernach confirm this by noting that he was blinded in 1099, probably the date of his death. The king-list also claims that he was first buried in Dunkeld but that &#145;Iona holds his bones&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 2.100); if so, he was the last Scottish king buried there. But the reported burial of Scottish kings on Iona may reflect only unfounded pretensions by the monastery on the island. The claim that he strangled a son of David I in revenge for being blinded is late and improbable. His part in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> derives from the fanciful tales in <span class="italic">Scotorum historiae</span> (1527) by Hector Boece or Boethius (<i>d</i>. 1536).<br>
<br>The name of Donald's wife (if he married) is unknown, but he had a daughter, Beth&oacute;c, from whom John Comyn of Badenoch (<i>d</i>. 1302) derived his claim to the throne in 1291.<br>
