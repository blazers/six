<span class="headword">Davies,  David</span>  (1742&#150;1819), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer on social issues</span>, was born on 9 February 1742 of Welsh parentage. His origins and early life are obscure, although his will suggests that his family originated in the border area of Merioneth and Denbighshire and came from a background of small farmers and country craftsmen. In 1755 he entered Codrington College, Barbados, as a foundation or charity scholar, and late in 1760 was appointed temporary usher, following the departure of the previous incumbent. He continued in that post until his resignation from the college on 14 June 1766. Between February 1762 and the autumn of 1763 he also acted as temporary headmaster, following the sudden death of the previous head. At that time he refused to take holy orders because of a reluctance to subscribe to certain of the Church of England's doctrines, and it was because of this that he left the college to become manager of a local sugar plantation. He remained there for three years, but clearly disliked the slavery associated with it. In early March 1791 he gave evidence before a select committee on the African slave trade in which he condemned the cruel treatment accorded the slaves.<br>
<br>About 1769 Davies returned to England and by March 1771 was engaged as tutor to Arthur Fowke, a nephew of Colonel John Walsh, a nabob and close friend of Robert Clive. He remained in Walsh's service as tutor and later secretary until at least the end of 1777. By March 1780 he had become tutor to the only surviving son of Lord Dartrey, an Anglo-Irish banker, who was raised later to Viscount Cremorne. In April 1782, while still in the Dartrey household, Davies was offered the rectory of Barkham, Berkshire, although as yet he had not taken holy orders.<br>
<br>On 28 April 1782 Davies was ordained deacon by the bishop of Chester on letters dimissory from the bishop of Salisbury, in whose diocese Barkham lay. On 26 May he was ordained priest and the following day was instituted into the benefice of St James, Barkham. He remained incumbent until his death. Despite this change of career, his links with both his previous employers in England remained strong and Viscountess Cremorne was a beneficiary under his will.<br>
<br>Davies's importance as a social commentator lies in his painstaking survey <span class="italic">The Case of Labourers in Husbandry Stated and Considered</span> (1795). It was based initially on researches into the living conditions of the labouring poor of Barkham but was extended to include labourers' budgets from many English counties, as well as a few from Wales and Scotland. The work was dedicated to the board of agriculture, since Davies considered that it possessed powers to investigate the economic plight of rural householders and to recommend pay increases where necessary. The book was well received, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of December 1795 expressing a hope that it would &#145;attract a degree of attention proportioned to the importance of the subject, and the merit of the execution&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 65, 1795, 1023). A second, abbreviated version was published in 1828, when the anonymous editor detailed some of the changes which had occurred in Barkham since the rector's death in 1819. Davies was also contacted by some of the leading poor-law reformers of his day, including the radical MP Samuel Whitbread.<br>
<br>Davies died on 6 February 1819 at the rectory, Barkham; his estate was valued at about &pound;4700, the bulk of it in stocks held at the Bank of England. Apart from legacies to his three servants and to Viscountess Cremorne and some of her servants, he bequeathed &pound;2127 to various Welsh relatives and acquaintances. The remainder of his estate went to charity (including the poor of Barkham, to whom he had given frequent help in his lifetime), and to English friends. In an obituary the <span class="italic">Reading Mercury</span> paid tribute to his &#145;humility of manner and attention to the wants of his poorer brethren&#146;  (15 Feb 1819), an indication that he had applied the theories advanced in his book to his daily duties as rector.<br>
