<span class="headword">Novikov <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kir&eacute;ev]</span>,  Olga</span>  (1840&#150;1925), <span class="occ">journalist and apologist for Russia</span>, was born in Moscow on 29 April 1840. She was one of the five children of Aleksey Kir&eacute;ev (<i>d</i>. 1849) and his wife, Aleksandra, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alabyev. Her father was educated by W. E. Baxter, later a Liberal MP, and, though strongly Slavophile, he spoke English as his second language, as did her mother. In 1860 she married Ivan Novikov (<i>d</i>. 1890), a colonel, and later general, in the <i>&eacute;tat major</i>; they had one child, Aleksandr. The Novikovs continued to move in pan-Slavist circles and were friends of Rector Keyserling of Dorpat University and K. P. Pobedonostsev, later the procurator of the Holy Synod. Initially by correspondence, Olga established connections with C. P. Villiers, Lord Clarendon, A. W. Kinglake, and John Tyndall. She was a keen supporter of links between the Old Catholics and the Orthodox churches. She first visited England in 1868 and returned in 1873, on which occasion she met the prince of Wales, Gladstone, and Disraeli. She argued that there was no necessary antagonism between Britain and Russia in central Asia and that good sense could lead to an entente.<br>
<br>In July 1876 Olga Novikov's brother Aleksandr was the first Russian volunteer to be killed in Serbia, and she embarked on an anti-Turkish crusade, which was bitterly hostile to Disraeli's government. She came to Britain in 1876, just after agitation against the Bulgarian atrocities had begun in earnest, setting up in Claridge's Hotel and becoming a prominent public figure through her letters and articles justifying the Russian position: it was for her activities at this time that Disraeli called her &#145;the MP for Russia in England&#146;. She was always a representative of Muscovite pan-Slavism, rather than official Russian policy. Although less influential than her notoriety at the time suggested, she was an unusual figure and, as a woman taking part in a political campaign on a foreign policy question together with the duke of Westminster and a former prime-minister, almost unique. Rumours that she was Gladstone's mistress&#151;&#145;an extremely accomplished whore&#146; was R. B. D. Morier's description  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 9.lxxxix, note)&#151;were wholly unfounded, as was the story that Gladstone escorted her to her hotel following the famous conference on the Eastern question on 7&#150;8 December 1876. However, she supplied the anti-atrocitarian campaign with much information and was a convenient link with Russian opinion. She became a regular writer of articles on Anglo-Russian affairs in W. T. Stead's <span class="italic">Northern Echo</span> and <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and other journals. She later crossed swords with Gladstone on Russia's record on liberty and on the pogroms of the 1880s. At the end of the century she defended the autocracy and later opposed the Duma. Olga Novikov had a considerable interest in spiritualism and played a part in introducing Helena Blatavsky to London life. She continued to visit Britain quite frequently and regarded the Anglo-Russian entente of 1907 as the fruit of her endeavours. During the First World War she wrote extensively for the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> and the <span class="italic">Asiatic Review</span>. Although she settled in London after 1917, living with one of her nieces, she was always something of a nomad, moving from personality to personality and collecting tokens of recognition. She died of pneumonia at 4 Brunswick Place, London, on 21 April 1925.<br>
