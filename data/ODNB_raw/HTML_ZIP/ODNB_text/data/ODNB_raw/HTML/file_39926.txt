<span class="headword">Clarke,  Thomas Ernest Bennett</span>  (1907&#150;1989), <span class="occ">author and screenwriter</span>, was born on 7 June 1907 in Watford, Hertfordshire, the younger son and third of four children of Sir Ernest Michael Clarke, a company director dealing in shipping and goldmines, and his wife, Madeline, daughter of Ernest Bennett Gardiner, an Irish bank manager. Clarke, always known as Tibby, attended Charterhouse and spent a year at Clare College, Cambridge, studying law, before visiting Australia, where he edited the <span class="italic">Red Heart</span>, a girls' magazine. He then travelled to New Zealand, San Francisco, and Canada. On his return to England he secured employment as junior editorial assistant on the <span class="italic">Hardware Trade Journal</span>, moving on to work for the weekly magazine <span class="italic">Answers</span> and other papers.<br>
<br>Clarke's work in the late 1920s as publicity officer for the W. S. Crawford Advertising Agency brought him into contact with the film industry for the first time, publicizing sound equipment systems for Western Electric. Clarke was made redundant in 1930 and decided to visit Argentina, securing his passage by becoming a purser on a tramp steamer. On his return he resumed work for <span class="italic">Answers</span> and wrote <span class="italic">Go South&#151;Go West</span> (1932), an account of his recent adventures abroad. Clarke secured another journalistic publicity job, editing the British Temperance and General Provident Institution's monthly magazine. He then decided to go freelance, continued work on his novels, and reported for the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>.<br>
<br>In the Second World War Clarke enlisted as a war reserve constable in the Metropolitan Police until asthma forced his discharge. He did not write screenplays until 1942, aged thirty-five, when Monja Danischewsky, director of publicity at <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93789', "Ealing Studios")</script>, asked Clarke to assist with unsatisfactory scripts before securing a contract as a screenwriter. His first screen credit was for &#145;doctoring&#146; the script of <span class="italic">For those in Peril</span> (1944), followed by <span class="italic">The Halfway House</span> (1944), a ghost story directed by Basil Dearden.<br>
<br>Clarke is best known for his Ealing comedies, and his first opportunity to work on comedy was to write a short sequence of the supernatural story film <span class="italic">Dead of Night</span> (1945). This was a prelude to his writing the first classic Ealing comedy, <span class="italic">Hue and Cry</span> (1946). One of his most famous comedies was <span class="italic">Passport to Pimlico</span> (1949), which celebrated its characters' discovery that an area of London belonged to Burgundy, thus freeing them from laws and petty restrictions, a theme that reflected its post-war audiences' desire to be rid of rationing. Clarke won an Oscar and an award at the Venice film festival for <span class="italic">The Lavender Hill Mob</span> (1951), about a Bank of England employee, played by Alec Guinness, who steals bullion and turns it into souvenir models of the Eiffel tower. The <span class="italic">Titfield Thunderbolt</span> (1952), about a village community trying to save a branch railway from closure, similarly celebrated individuals who battled against authority. Although these films had no clear political message, their themes tapped into the mood of post-war austerity, and reflected the concerns of many British people. Clarke also scripted <span class="italic">The Blue Lamp</span> (1949), a police drama from a play by Ted Willis, starring Jack Warner and Dirk Bogarde.<br>
<br>Clarke was associated with Ealing's most productive years, when it was a studio with a distinctive outlook and structure, which enabled its head, Sir Michael Balcon, to initiate some of the British cinema's most famous films. In 1955 Ealing was sold to the BBC and Clarke went freelance, working in Hollywood and Britain. He scripted John Ford's <span class="italic">Gideon's Day</span> (1958) and adapted literary classics during this period. But his days of writing original screenplays were over, and he was never again allowed the freedom or creative inspiration he enjoyed at Ealing. The last film with a Clarke screen credit was <span class="italic">A Man could Get Killed</span> (1966). In 1952 he was appointed OBE. He published a witty and penetrating autobiography in 1974, <span class="italic">This is Where I Came In</span>. He continued to write novels throughout his career as a screenwriter, from <span class="italic">Jeremy's England</span> (1934), to <span class="italic">Grim Discovery</span> (1983).<br>
<br>Clarke was a courteous, sensitive man with a great sense of humour, who fulfilled his ambition to become a racehorse owner in the 1960s. He was genial and portly, with a youthful appearance; his distinctive brown hair had a silver streak. On 23 July 1932 he married Joyce Caroline Jenny (1906/7&#150;1983), daughter of Roy Rockwell Steele, engineer. They had a son, Michael, a film producer who died in a drowning accident in 1966, and a daughter, Ann. Clarke died on 11 February 1989 in London.<br>
