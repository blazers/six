<span class="headword">Foulkes,  Charles Howard</span>  (1875&#150;1969), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Bangalore, India, on 1 February 1875, the fifth of seven sons and one daughter of the Revd Thomas Foulkes (1826&#150;1901), chaplain of St John's, Bangalore, and his second wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fischer (<i>d</i>. 1912). His father, a former missionary, was a senior chaplain in the Madras government service and a distinguished Tamil and Sanskrit scholar. At the age of seven Charles left India to spend two years' schooling with the Revd Samuel Pettigrew of Puddlestone, Herefordshire, then five years at Lord Weymouth's School, Warminster, before attending Bedford modern school for two years, which had an &#145;army class&#146;. He then passed into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, at the age of seventeen.<br>
<br>Gazetted and commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1894, Foulkes found outlets for his versatile skills in a wide range of imperial service. As a second lieutenant, aged only twenty-two years, he undertook a posting to Sierra Leone as the commanding royal engineer, West Africa. He built coastal defences and accommodation, drew up the first defence plan for the Gold Coast, inspected buildings in the Gambia, and served on the &#145;Hut Tax Expedition&#146; (1898&#150;9), for which he was awarded the West Africa medal with clasp. Invalided home with malaria, he sought service in the South African War (1899&#150;1902) by devising a bicycle-mounted photo-reconnaissance unit, and convincing Sir Evelyn Wood, the adjutant-general, of its potential value. Despite the success of this pioneering initiative, Foulkes was absorbed into the 1st field troop RE and later served as a staff captain, intelligence, with a cavalry brigade. Awarded the South African medal with six clasps, he was ordered back to Sierra Leone in 1900.<br>
<br>During his second tour in Sierra Leone, Foulkes undertook further service on the Gold Coast, and, when on leave in 1902, visited St Vincent and French Martinique, where volcanoes had erupted. He used his photographic skills to make a military reconnaissance of the French island, without causing embarrassment to the French authorities. Foulkes was invited subsequently to become a member of the Anglo-French commission appointed to delimit the 1000-mile boundary of northern Nigeria in hostile and largely unexplored country. While taking astronomical observations he received news that a tribal battle was about to occur, and so rode off across 175 miles of desert tracks, with five African soldiers and his personal servant, to apprehend the fugitive Emir Aliyu of Kano and bring him back to Sir Frederick Lugard, the high commissioner. Although Lugard congratulated Foulkes, the head of the boundary commission, Lieutenant-Colonel Gilbert Elliot, deplored his recklessness and, after another bout of malaria, Foulkes returned home but earned the Northern Nigeria medal in 1902.<br>
<br>Later posted to Edinburgh, Foulkes took charge of the Ordnance Survey of Scotland and spent five happy years (1904&#150;9) there. He married in London, on 14 September 1904, Dorothea Fanny Oakey (1880&#150;1967), daughter of Herbert Oakey, emery manufacturer. A superb sportsman, he played football for Heart of Midlothian and hockey for Scotland, representing the country in the 1908 Olympic games and captaining the Scottish hockey side throughout the 1908&#150;9 season. He spent three years commanding the 31st (Fortress) company, Ceylon, where he could indulge his passion and skill in big-game hunting.<br>
<br>After a brief posting at Chatham, Foulkes was promoted to major and given command of the 11th field company, RE, at the outset of the First World War. He served in the early engagements of the war, winning the DSO for &#145;conspicuous gallantry&#146; at Cuinchy in February 1915. He was mentioned in dispatches, made a chevalier of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and awarded the French Croix de Guerre with palm for gallantry. He became most identified, though, as the leader of Britain's gas retaliation after Germany's first major use of poison gas at Ypres on 22 April 1915. In May 1915 he was appointed to raise, train, and command four &#145;special companies&#146; of scientists, chemists, and undergraduates to deliver the first British use of chlorine gas, discharged from 5500 cylinders at the battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. Although Foulkes always claimed that the gas and smoke cloud had achieved surprise, and it may have helped the advance across part of the front, the wind proved capricious and some of it blew back over British trenches. Loos did not achieve the desired breakthrough, and henceforth gas, whether dispersed from cylinders (as Foulkes preferred) or from less-weather dependent systems&#151;shells, 4-inch mortars, and projectors&#151;had a largely supportive role, harassing the enemy and inflicting casualties upon any unprotected enemies. In 1916 he was placed in command of the Special Brigade, RE, into which the special companies for gas warfare were organized, comprising 6000 of all ranks. In June 1917 he succeeded Henry Thuillier as director of gas services, in charge of the defensive and offensive gas duties, and became president of the chemical warfare committee of the Ministry of Munitions (1918).<br>
<br>Foulkes emerged from the war with the 1914 and Victory medals, the order of the Crown and Croix de Guerre with palm from Belgium, the Italian order of the Crown, the American distinguished service medal, and the CMG. After serving on the Holland committee which made recommendations about the post-war organization of British chemical warfare, he was sent as a brigadier-general to GHQ India. He toured the north-west frontier, found plenty of scope for the potential use of chemical weapons, lectured the viceroy on chemical warfare, and served in the Third Afghan War, earning the India general service medal with clasp (Waziristan), 1919&#150;20.<br>
<br>Foulkes served briefly in Ireland during the Anglo-Irish War and was given charge of a propaganda department in Dublin but this never functioned for political reasons. He then held several command posts in England, including chief engineer, Aldershot (1926&#150;30). In 1927 he was created CB and, in the following year, became ADC to George V. Promoted to major-general in 1930, he was placed on half-pay and elected to retire. He received more honours: the coronation medal in 1937, appointment as colonel commandant RE from 1937 to 1945, and, in 1962, the rare award of a gold medal from the Institution of Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>In retirement Foulkes continued to lecture and write about chemical warfare, including his controversial <span class="italic">&#145;Gas!&#146; The Story of the Special Brigade</span> (1934), which lauded the achievements of his unit and claimed that &#145;gas on the battlefield &hellip; changed the whole character of warfare&#146;. He also wrote <span class="italic">Commonsense and ARP</span> (1934) and several articles for the <span class="italic">Royal Engineers Journal</span>. He remained in close touch with his old comrades and regularly spoke at the annual reunion dinners.<br>
<br>For most of his life Foulkes was astonishingly fit and had exemplary hand&#150;eye co-ordination, playing cricket, tennis, rugby, billiards, and first-class hockey until he was fifty-five. Although not very tall, he was remarkably strong and was regarded as the star pupil of the Victorian body-builder Eugen Sandow. A devoted family man, he cared for his wife, who was crippled with arthritis in later life, until her death in 1967. Their one daughter had died at the age of five in a carriage accident in Ceylon, but the three sons survived. Foulkes died on 6 May 1969 in a nursing home in Branksomewood Road, Fleet, Hampshire, and was cremated at the Park crematorium, Aldershot. A memorial service was held in the chapel of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, on 10 June. His eldest son, Major-General Thomas Herbert Fischer Foulkes (1908&#150;1986), was colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers from 1963 to 1973.<br>
