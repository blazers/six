<span class="headword">Blaikie,  Walter Biggar</span>  (1847&#150;1928), <span class="occ">civil engineer and publisher</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 23 November 1847, the second son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2562/', "Revd William Garden Blaikie (1820&#150;1899)")</script>, minister at Pilrig, a Disruption father of the Free Church of Scotland, later professor of apologetics and pastoral theology at New College, Edinburgh, and his wife, Margaret Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1915), daughter of Walter Biggar, a retired fish merchant resident in Edinburgh. Like his relative Robert Louis Stevenson, with whom he shared a childhood nurse, Blaikie was destined to be a civil engineer. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and privately in Brussels before attending classes at Edinburgh University and training in the office of B. and E. Blyth, noted railway engineers. He went to India in 1870 to work first for the raja of Kathiawar, and then for the public works department of the government of India, in which he became executive engineer, military works. In 1873 he married Janet Marshall (only daughter of John Macfie of Edinburgh); they had five daughters. The Indian climate suited neither Blaikie's wife nor their first child, so he returned to Scotland on leave and resigned in 1879.<br>
<br>Blaikie was about to emigrate to Australia when he happened to meet, at King's Cross Station, London, Thomas Constable, the queen's printer in Edinburgh, a fellow Edinburgh Academical, and an elder of Pilrig Free Church, who suggested that he try a spell in the printing trade. Six months later he became a partner in T. and A. Constable, Thistle Street, Edinburgh. He settled in Colinton and rose to be company chairman, an authority on the history of Scottish typography, and a printer of fine editions of, among others, the works of R. L. Stevenson.<br>
<br>Passionately interested in non-telescopic astronomy, Blaikie published annually from 1898 until 1920 an elaborate set of star maps designed to help amateurs. His ingenious spherical planisphere calculating device was appreciated by the Greenwich and Edinburgh observatories. He wrote articles for the magazine of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, of which he was a founder, and for long a member of council. A fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, he was prominent in the Scottish History Society, and a founder and president of the Old Edinburgh Club. He was also a member and office bearer of the Scottish Society of Arts. As generous-hearted as he was brusquely businesslike, he was chairman of the Edinburgh chamber of commerce in 1903&#150;6, and from 1900 to 1920 a manager of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.<br>
<br>Blaikie wrote and printed for the Scottish History Society his meticulous <span class="italic">Itinerary of Prince Charles Edward Stuart</span> (1897) and the substantial volume, <span class="italic">Origins of the Forty-Five</span> (1916). He put money into the <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span>, which in 1891 became the London-based <span class="italic">National Observer</span>. He also helped found the <span class="italic">Celtic Review</span> and was president of the Royal Celtic Society, 1921&#150;6.<br>
<br>Edinburgh University awarded Blaikie an honorary LLD in 1913. He was a JP and from 1918 a deputy lieutenant of Edinburgh. One daughter married Robert Kilpatrick, managing director of T. and A. Constable. Two others, Alice and Margaret Blaikie, presented his Jacobite pamphlets and manuscripts to the National Library of Scotland as a memorial after his death in an Edinburgh nursing home on 3 May 1928.<br>
