<span class="headword">Shillibeer,  George</span>  (1797&#150;1866), <span class="occ">omnibus promoter</span>, was born in Tottenham Court Road, London, but nothing else is known about his origins. He entered the navy, but did not remain long in the service, quitting it as midshipman. He then went to a firm in Long Acre to be taught coach building. In 1825 he sought cabriolet licences in London and a year later was in business with John Cavill, coach builder and livery stable keeper, Bury Street, Bloomsbury. He also possessed what he claimed as &#145;an establishment&#146; in Paris &#145;for the sale [<i>sic</i>] of carriages&#146;.<br>
<br>In July 1828 Shillibeer petitioned the Treasury to be allowed to run omnibuses of the sort which had started in Paris two months before&#151;which he had visited Paris to see&#151;under the more English name of &#145;Economist&#146;. His petition was turned down because of the hackney coach monopoly on London's central streets. This, however, did not prevent him from running under stage coach legislation north of the central area along the new road from Paddington Green to the Bank via Islington. He started a three-horse vehicle on the route carrying twenty passengers all inside on 4 July 1829, charging high middle&#150;class fares&#151;a shilling all the way (6<i>d</i>. half way)&#151;and wisely called his vehicle, the latest from Paris, an omnibus not an economist.<br>
<br>Shillibeer knew how to copy the carriage-building ideas of others but was unable to exploit his initial advantage. Although he soon put five more of his larger omnibuses on the route, competitors ran many more, wisely preferring more manoeuvrable two-horse vehicles licensed to carry fifteen (twelve inside and three on the roof by the coachman), which paid lower mileage duty, levied on the vehicle irrespective of the number of passengers carried. Shillibeer was unable to meet the higher mileage duty on his vehicles and a commission of bankruptcy was ordered against him on 4 March 1831, though he continued in business after assignees had been appointed. The others could not withstand the competition much longer and the racing to pick up passengers was proving dangerous. Operators met on 10 September 1831 and, paying Shillibeer the compliment of appointing him to the chair, decided to stop thirty-three vehicles and allocate scheduled times at three-minute intervals to the remaining fifty-seven. These times could be bought and sold, thus enabling larger business to be built up.<br>
<br>Omnibuses were admitted to the central area when the hackney coach monopoly was ended on 5 January 1832 but Shillibeer's larger vehicles were unsuitable for the narrow streets. He ran a three-horse &#145;New Patent Improved Diligence&#146; from London to Brighton during the 1830s and put omnibuses on the route from London to Greenwich and Woolwich from 1833; but steamboat competition and the opening of the first part of the London and Greenwich Railway diverted passengers. Again he was unable to pay his taxes but this time (1836) all his property was seized and he had to flee to Boulogne to escape his creditors. On his return he was sentenced in the insolvent debtors court to several months in the Fleet prison. When released, he took a job on the London and Southampton Railway but soon found himself inside again after 130 gallons of uncustomed brandy, smuggled from Boulogne, were discovered in premises he owned in Camden Town. From prison he sought Treasury recognition of his services in introducing the omnibus to London either by an appointment as inspector of omnibus duties or permission to operate twenty omnibuses tax-free for seven years. These entreaties came to nothing, however, partly, it would seem, because of the change of government in 1841.<br>
<br>Shillibeer's last years were relatively tranquil and more remunerative. He patented a new type of funeral carriage and, again copying Paris, took the Pompes Fun&egrave;bres as his model which cut funeral costs, and set up as an undertaker in the City Road. He gave evidence before the Board of Health on the question of extramural sepulture in 1850. He died from a carbuncle, on 22 August 1866, at 7 North Street, Quadrant, Brighton, and was buried in the churchyard at Chigwell, Essex, where in 1929, the busmen of London erected a tablet in the church in memory of the &#145;inventor of the London Omnibus&#146;.<br>
