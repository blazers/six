<span class="headword">Kellgren,  Jonas Henrik <span class="st"> [Jonky]</span></span>  (1911&#150;2002), <span class="occ">rheumatologist</span>, was born on 11 September 1911 in Hindhead, Frensham, Surrey, the fourth child and only son of Jonas Henrik (Harry) Kellgren (1874&#150;1918), medical practitioner, and his wife, Vera Feodrovna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dumelunksen (1872&#150;1964), whose father had been governor of Viatkov province in Russia. His father was of Swedish descent, but had been born in Gotha, Germany.<br>
<br>As a boy, Kellgren (always known as Jonky to distinguish him from his father and grandfather, all of the same names) grew up in a medical tradition. His grandfather ran a successful medical institute in Sweden patronized by the wealthy from Britain. It was to that institute that his mother Vera fled seeking sanctuary as a penniless refugee from Russia: she had secretly taught factory workers to read and write, a criminally subversive activity under the tsarist regime. In due course she married the eldest son, Kellgren's father, and the couple moved to Eaton Square, London, to set up a branch of the institute for the convenience of UK clients. The business collapsed after Kellgren's father died in the 1918&#150;19 influenza pandemic. The family was left impoverished, but a grateful patient paid for the young Kellgren's education at Bedales School and University College medical school, where his intellectual potential was soon apparent. He graduated MB BS in 1934, was admitted MRCP in 1935, FRCS in 1936, and FRCP in 1951, and graduated MSc (Manchester) in 1957. On 3 January 1934 he married a fellow medical student, Ruth Alice Rushton (<i>b</i>. 1905), daughter of William Rushton, dental surgeon. They had a daughter, Judith. The marriage was dissolved in 1940.<br>
<br>In 1938, after gaining postgraduate degrees in both medicine and surgery (he was later to regard the latter achievement as unfortunate), he won a scholarship to study physical medicine in Scandinavia, returning to University College to investigate the physiology of pain, under the direction of Sir Thomas Lewis. Lewis was interested in pain arising in the cardiovascular system, particularly angina pectoris and the pain in the legs associated with restricted blood flow. He did not accept that &#145;neuritis&#146; explained the pain of angina pectoris which, when severe, spread down the inner side of the left arm to the fingers. Lewis had used injections of a 6 per cent salt solution as a harmless but pain-evoking substance when injected under the skin. Kellgren expanded this work in a meticulous and comprehensive study of how pain arising in structures deep inside the body is felt at a distance from its cause. His research, published as three papers in <span class="italic">Clinical Science</span>, laid the foundation of understanding the mechanisms of deep pain. In 1937 he described the effects of the salt solution on ligaments, bones, tendons, and muscles. Injecting the muscle in the front of the thigh, for example, caused diffuse pain around the knee. Kellgren painstakingly (literally, since he was one of his experimental subjects) mapped the referral areas of pain from all the main muscles and fibrous structures of the body. The work explained how pain arising in the low back could be felt in the leg as sciatica or pain from the neck could radiate down the arm. In his third paper he described how such pains could mimic pain from one of the abdominal organs. He showed that there were no qualitative differences between somatic (bone and muscle) pain and visceral pain. Pain was, he found, &#145;all the same colour&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1939 Kellgren gained a Beit memorial fellowship to continue his studies but these were suspended when the Second World War was declared. He had planned his future as a physician but his dean, noting his surgical qualification, put him in charge of a surgical unit at the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, which had been evacuated to Hemel Hempstead. With little practical surgical experience he had to learn his skills on the job. Later, at Leavesden Hospital, he received proper training and undertook surgery for prolapsed intervertebral discs, interrupted by surgery for survivors of the Dunkirk evacuation. In 1941 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a major and took part in the landings in Algiers and the campaign in Tunisia. He followed the army through Sicily and Italy. On 6 June 1942 he married an American army nurse, Thelma Marian Reynolds (<i>b</i>. 1914). She was the daughter of Lester Leroy Reynolds, building contractor's foreman. They had four daughters, Joanna, Nina, Ingrid, and Lee.<br>
<br>Kellgren returned to Britain in 1946 after five years of surgery and worked at the Wingfield Morris Orthopaedic Hospital, Oxford, studying the consequences of peripheral nerve injuries and the effect of cooling on pain perception. In 1948 a grant of &pound;120,000 a year for ten years from the Nuffield Foundation funded the University of Manchester Centre for Research into Chronic Rheumatism, with Kellgren as director. In 1953 he became Britain's first professor of rheumatology. He established an epidemiological unit that uncovered the causes of rheumatic complaints in coalminers. The unit undertook a sample survey of the inhabitants of the town of Leigh in Lancashire, indicating the population frequency and national burden of different rheumatic complaints. Kellgren described nodal osteoarthritis occurring in elderly women and often running in families, characterized by knobs on the last joints of the fingers and involvement of the small joints in the back and neck. He established radiological criteria for the severity of osteoarthritis. With his colleague James Sharp he documented one of the few causes of sudden death in inflammatory arthritis: destruction of the top two joints in the neck. Studies were done on ankylosing spondylitis, the &#145;poker back&#146; disease mainly affecting young men, and he taught that, unlike patients with rheumatoid arthritis, they were better when exercised and worse if rested.<br>
<br>Kellgren was appointed expert adviser to the World Health Organization in 1961. He was pro-vice-chancellor of Manchester University (1967&#150;72) and dean of the medical school (1968&#150;73), coping with student riots and appointing new professors. He helped to develop postgraduate centres in every main hospital in the Manchester region, and to plan two additional teaching complexes at Salford and south Manchester. After retirement in 1976 he sat on the Flowers working party, which reviewed the twelve London teaching hospitals and fourteen postgraduate institutes in 1984. In 1996 new research facilities for the Manchester Institute of Musculo-Skeletal Medicine were named the J. H. Kellgren laboratories in his honour.<br>
<br>Kellgren's hobbies included landscape painting, mountain climbing, and gardening at his weekend cottage in the Lake District, to which he moved on retirement and which contained several important pieces made by his brother-in-law, the furniture maker Edward Barnsley. He died at his home, Beckside Cottage, Rusland, near Ulverston, Cumbria, on 22 February 2002, of heart failure; he had also been suffering from prostate cancer. He was buried at Rusland church on 28 February. He was survived by his second wife, Thelma, and his five daughters.<br>
