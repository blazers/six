<span class="headword">Pierson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1573&#150;1633), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of Weaverham, Cheshire; his parents are unknown. He was educated at the free school in Northwich and admitted in 1590 as a pensioner to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, a centre of puritanism. He graduated BA in 1594 and proceeded MA in 1597.<br>
<br>In 1599 Pierson took holy orders and, having returned to his native county, served as lecturer at Northwich for about two years and then as lecturer at Weaverham for a similar time. At Northwich he was involved in the case of Thomas Harrison, a young boy believed to be possessed or bewitched. Soon afterwards he married Helen Harvey, the widow of Christopher Harvey (<i>d</i>. 1601), the town preacher at Bunbury, and mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12511/', "Christopher Harvey (1597&#150;1663)")</script>. In 1603 Pierson returned to Cambridge to prepare some of the publications of the famed puritan divine William Perkins for the press. During this time Pierson was also employed as household chaplain to Oliver St John, Baron St John of Bletso (Bletsoe) in Bedfordshire, and he dedicated some of the resulting publications to Lord St John and his son Oliver, the future earl of Bolingbroke.<br>
<br>In 1612 Pierson was appointed rector of Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire, by the staunch puritan and future parliamentarian Sir Robert Harley. Here Pierson took the lead in evangelizing an area that had not yet been touched by puritan clerical zeal. He also acted as a local agent for the London-based feoffees for impropriations, to whom Harley had sold the advowson and tithes of Presteigne. Pierson's career at Brampton illustrates the tensions inherent in translating moderate puritanism from the academic setting of the university to the practical arena of the parish. Although he was a nonconformist, and undoubtedly had some misgivings about the nature of the Stuart episcopacy, Pierson was unwilling to separate formally from the established church. His nonconformity was initially opposed by his patron's father, Thomas Harley, and he was repeatedly reported to the diocesan authorities over the next decade for a variety of puritan practices including not wearing the surplice, not using the sign of the cross in baptism, administering communion to parishioners who were standing, and adapting the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> to his own use. Successive bishops of Hereford treated Pierson relatively leniently, partly because of the power of his patron.<br>
<br>The main source for Pierson's life is a manuscript biography, which was written about 1699&#150;1700 and describes among other things his religious observances. At Brampton, Pierson preached twice on the sabbath as well as lecturing there and elsewhere on weekdays. He habitually rose at four to study for an hour and then summoned his servants for religious instruction. After dinner and supper a chapter was read from the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and on one evening a week Pierson catechized his household. Under his aegis the Harleys observed the official ember-day fasts as well as regular private days of fasting and thanksgiving. Pierson was also concerned at the lack of able preachers in the region and set up a combination lecture as a form of clerical training at Leintwardine, where Harley was the patron. Lectures were also set up by Pierson at Knighton and at Bromfield.<br>
<br>Pierson died on 16 October 1633 and in his will he appointed his stepson, Christopher Harvey, as his literary executor. Two works by Pierson were subsequently published: a sermon, <span class="italic">The Cure of Hurtfull Cares and Feares</span> (1636), and an exposition of four psalms, <span class="italic">Excellent Encouragements Against Afflictions</span> (1647). Both books are anti-Catholic in tone and demonstrate Pierson's belief in predestination and his fears about Arminianism. Pierson also left an important library of 441 theological books to the care of Harley, Harvey, and two other Shropshire gentlemen: Richard More of More and Humphrey Walcot of Walcot. This was an unusually large collection for a parish minister, and the books were to be maintained as a circulating library for the use of thirteen named local clerics. In 1680 some of the books were amalgamated into the parish library at St Peter's Church in More, which survived into the twenty-first century. Pierson's ministry reveals some of the links that were forged between puritan groups in Cheshire and the Welsh marches with puritans in London and Cambridge. His religious influence in the border region around Brampton was recalled at Sir Robert Harley's funeral in 1656, when Pierson was described as a &#145;blessed servant of God &hellip; whose exemplary graces and ministery shed a rich influence abroad the country&#146;  (Froysell, 100).<br>
