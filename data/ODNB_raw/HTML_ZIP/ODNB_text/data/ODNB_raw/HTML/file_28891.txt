<span class="headword">Watts,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1529&#150;1579), <span class="occ">naval administrator and benefactor</span>, was born at West Peckham, Kent, and migrated to Rochester in or about 1552. In 1547 he was appointed joint purveyor of naval victualling with Edward Baeshe, an appointment which foreshadowed the latter's appointment in June 1550 as general surveyor of victuals for the navy. As surveyor of victuals for Ireland, Watts acted as Baeshe's deputy, and was paid to supply English forces sent to Ireland in 1550 and 1551. His work may explain his move to Rochester, whence supplies were sent to the fleet which was increasingly using the Medway as a safe winter and peacetime anchorage. By a patent dated 26 March 1560 he was appointed paymaster and surveyor of the works at Upnor Castle to erect a blockhouse &#145;for the savegarde of our Navye&#146;. Saunders attributes the plan and initial design to Sir Richard Lee and the practical supervision to Humfrey Locke, described as surveyor and chief carpenter, with Richard Watts acting as the accounting officer and administrator. His accounts cover the period 1559&#150;64, with a second set covering the period to 1567, when the final payment was made to the &#145;paynters for paynting the Lyon with the vane and handle of yeon, set upon the toppe of the steis with 16<i>d</i>. for one gallon of Oyle and with 9<i>s</i>. for haulfe a hundrethe of fyne gold&#146;  (Saunders, 271). Work on Upnor Castle then ceased until it was decided to improve the fortifications in the vicinity of Chatham in 1599.<br>
<br>Watts sat in Elizabeth's second parliament, 1563&#150;7, as MP for Rochester and received a visit from the queen during her progress through Surrey and Kent in 1573. The story goes that when at leave-taking the host apologized for the insufficiency of his house, the queen remarked &#145;satis&#146;. Watts took this as a compliment and named his house on Rochester's Bully Hill &#145;Satis&#146;. He died on 10 September 1579 and was buried in Rochester Cathedral. In his will, made on 21 or 22 August 1579 and proved at Rochester a month later, he left Satis House to his wife, Marian, for life; afterwards it was to be sold to build and maintain almshouses. However, he failed to make it clear whether the widow and sole executor was to keep Satis if she remarried. In 1586 the corporation claimed the property from her and her second husband, but agreed to a settlement by which they retained possession. According to his will, Watts's charity also provided for the provision of:<blockquote>six matrices or flock beds and other good and sufficient furniture &hellip; to harbour or lodge in poor travellers or wayfaring men, being no common rogues &hellip; the said wayfaring men to harbour therein no longer than one night unless sickness be the farther cause thereof; and those poor folks there dwelling should keep the same sweet and courteously intreat the said poor travellers; and every of the said poor travellers at their first coming in to have fourpence. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>The revenue of the charity, originally 20 marks, had risen to &pound;500 a year in 1771 and to &pound;7000 a year in 1859. At this date the charity was remodelled and twenty almsfolk lodged in a new building on the Maidstone road, with an allowance of &pound;30 a year each. The unusual character of the charity attracted the interest of nineteenth-century antiquarians, including Charles Dickens, who urged its reform in the Christmas number of <span class="italic">Household Words</span> for 1854. A bust of Watts, copied from one that is said to have been executed during his lifetime, surmounts a monument erected to his memory in 1736 by the corporation at the instance of the then mayor, also named Richard Watts.<br>
