<span class="headword">Landseer,  Charles</span>  (1799/1800&#150;1879), <span class="occ">painter of historical and genre subjects</span>, was born on 12 August 1799 or 1800 at 71 Queen Anne Street East, London, the second son to achieve adulthood among the fourteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15986/', "John George Landseer (1762/3&#150;1852)")</script>, engraver and antiquary, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Potts (1773/4&#150;1840). Having received early instruction in art from his father, in 1816 Charles Landseer entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he remained for approximately three years. Together with his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15987/', "Thomas Landseer")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15984/', "Edwin Landseer")</script>, he also became a pupil of Benjamin Robert Haydon. In the 1820s Landseer accompanied Lord Stuart de Rothesay to Portugal and Rio de Janeiro on his mission to negotiate a commercial treaty with Don Pedro I. He executed numerous sketches for the latter and on his return exhibited six paintings based on his travels at the British Institution (1827, 1828) and the Society of British Artists (1827).<br>
<br>Charles Landseer was represented by 126 works at the British Institution (1822&#150;46), the Society of British Artists (1824&#150;35), the Royal Academy (1828&#150;79), the Liverpool Academy (1830&#150;65), and the Royal Manchester Institution (1840, 1843). Until the mid-1830s he exhibited landscapes, portraits (among unexhibited subjects were the radical journalist Thomas Jonathan Wooler, Sir Thomas Lawrence, president of the Royal Academy, and Harriet Grote), genre and literary scenes from Jonathan Richardson, Cervantes, and Laurence Sterne: his <span class="italic">Clarissa Harlowe in the Prison Room of the Sheriff's Office</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1833&#150;4; Tate collection) was bought by Robert Vernon, and <span class="italic">Sterne's Maria</span> (exh. British Institution, 1836; V&amp;A) by John Sheepshanks. The success of two ambitious paintings, <span class="italic">The Plundering of Basing House, Hants; Taken and Destroyed by Cromwell, Oct. 14 1645</span> (exh. RA, and Liverpool Academy, 1836; Tate collection) and <span class="italic">The Death of Douglas at the Battle of Langside</span> (exh. RA, 1837; ex Town and Country Estates Ltd, Ireland, 19 September 1956) led to his election as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1837 and determined the historical nature of the majority of his future exhibits. Other major paintings of this type include <span class="italic">The Pillaging of a Jew's House in the Reign of Richard I</span> (exh. RA, and Liverpool Academy, 1839 and British Institution, 1840; Tate collection) measuring 6 feet 3 inches by 7 feet 9 inches; <span class="italic">The Temptation of Andrew Marvell</span> (exh. RA, 1841; V&amp;A); and <span class="italic">Charles I on the Eve of the Battle of Edgehill</span> (exh. RA, 1845; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). In the 1840s and early 1850s Charles Landseer achieved considerable success: his works were engraved for the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> and the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>; three paintings were chosen by Art Union prize-winners for &pound;300, &pound;400, and &pound;300 respectively (<span class="italic">The Departure of Charles II from Bentley in Staffordshire</span> (exh. RA, 1842), <span class="italic">The Monks of Melrose</span> (exh. RA, 1843, and lent for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester, 1887), and <span class="italic">The Return of the Dove to the Ark</span> (exh. RA, 1844; Forbes Magazine collection).<br>
<br>In 1845 Landseer was elected Royal Academician and in 1851 keeper of the Royal Academy, a post which involved instructing pupils in the antique school. From the 1860s, however, Landseer's work met with increasing criticism and towards the end of his life he was renowned mainly for his puns and witticisms (he was responsible for the description of photography as a &#145;foe-to-graphic&#146; art) and for his likeable nature. In May 1873 he retired from his post as keeper, with a pension equivalent to his former salary. Charles Landseer never married and always lived with members of his family. He died on 22 July 1879 at his home, 35 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex, having bequeathed &pound;10,000 of his considerable property (part of which he inherited from his brother Edwin) to the Royal Academy for the foundation of scholarships. A sale of the contents of his studio was held at Christies on 14 April 1880. An obituarist described his work as characterized by &#145;careful execution, appropriate accessories and costumes rather than by striking effects and grandeur of character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 18, 1879, 217). Examples of his work are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate collection, the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and the Ferens Art Gallery, Kingston upon Hull.<br>
