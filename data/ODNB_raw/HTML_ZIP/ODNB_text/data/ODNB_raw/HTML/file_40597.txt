<span class="headword">Macleane,  Lauchlin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Laughlin McLean]</span>  (1728/9&#150;1778), <span class="occ">political agent and speculator</span>, was born some time between 30 May 1728 and 29 May 1729, at either Ballymoney or Rasharkin, both in co. Antrim, Ireland. He was the eldest of four children of the Revd John McLean (1699&#150;1765), Church of Ireland vicar of Billy in co. Antrim, and of his wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1708&#150;77), daughter of the Revd Philip Matthews (<i>c</i>.1665&#150;1740). In his early years he was known as Laughlin (the Irish version of his first name) McLean, but he consistently styled himself Lauchlin Macleane from 1764. These and other recorded variations are indicative of the mixing of Scottish and Irish elements in his background. His forebears were the Macleans of Girishpool on the island of Coll in the Hebrides. His paternal grandfather had left Scotland after 1689 for northern Ireland, where he was ordained into the Church of Ireland. McLean's father followed into the church. Laughlin McLean spent the early years of his life in Ireland, going to John Dennison's school near Belfast, and then studying medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, from 1746 to 1752, from which he graduated MB. Later in life he described himself as an Irishman and it is assumed that he spoke with an Irish brogue  (Maclean, <span class="italic">Reward is Secondary</span>, 21, 46).<h2>
<a name="Frommedicinetocolonialspeculations"></a>From medicine to colonial speculations</h2>From 1752 to 1756 McLean lived for the only time in his life in Scotland, the land of his paternal ancestors. From 1752 to 1755 he studied at Edinburgh University, gaining his MD. During his time in Edinburgh he formed close friendships with a number of Scots, including members of the Maclean clan, who were to link their fortunes with his in later life. Some of them had Jacobite sympathies, to which McLean himself may have been attracted. In Edinburgh on 30 March 1755 McLean married Elizabeth Hewitt (<i>d</i>. 1791), daughter of Dr John Hewitt, physician in the service of the Russian tsar.<br>
<br>In 1756, like many young doctors with the highly esteemed Edinburgh degree, McLean sought his fortune in the British possessions overseas. For the rest of his life he was to play for very high stakes indeed in the world of new opportunities that was being opened up by British success in the Seven Years' War.<br>
<br>McLean began his career abroad by setting up a successful medical practice in Philadelphia. He was then appointed surgeon in 1757 to the force that was to capture Fort Duquesne (later Pittsburgh) from the French. In 1760 he served with an expedition into Canada to take Montreal. Through his military service McLean was able to ingratiate himself with his first important patron, Major-General Robert Monckton, a very gallant officer with a sharp and not notably discriminating eye for personal enrichment. Monckton appointed him in 1761 to the potentially lucrative post of commissary of provisions and supplies for the army being assembled in North America to attack the French West Indies. In February 1762 the British captured the rich island of Martinique and Monckton appointed McLean to be the receiver and collector-general of revenues in the new British administration. Britain relinquished Martinique at the peace in 1763, but by then McLean was well placed to speculate in and to acquire lands in two of the so-called Ceded Islands that Britain retained, Grenada and Dominica. He seems to have acted as agent for a syndicate of speculators, who, as one of the most of prominent of them later put it, hoped to &#145;take advantage of the madness of people to become purchasers&#146; in the new islands by buying up large tracts to be resold  (Colebrooke, 1.82). It was believed that he had been given credit of up to &pound;200,000  (Maclean, <span class="italic">Reward is Secondary</span>, 82). He also acquired land for himself in both Grenada and Dominica as part of a joint venture in which he and a partner were entitled to a share nominally worth &pound;20,000  (ibid., 83&#150;5). In 1763 McLean returned to Britain where he began to develop political connections. He was a close friend of Edmund Burke, another Irishman making his way in British public life, and he acted as an intermediary between British political figures and John Wilkes, who was living in exile in Paris. In 1766 he obtained the appointment of governor of St Vincent, another of the Ceded Islands, and presumably an advantageous post for managing his landed interests elsewhere.<h2>
<a name="ShelburneIndiaandthegreatscheme"></a>Shelburne, India, and the &#145;great scheme&#146;</h2>Macleane (as he now called himself) did not, however, take up his appointment or return to the Caribbean. Political interests kept him in London. He had been introduced to William Petty, second earl of Shelburne, who, when he became secretary of state for the southern department, &#145;in an evil moment for himself&#146;  (Sutherland, <span class="italic">East India Company</span>, 154) appointed Macleane as his under-secretary in October 1766. Macleane's relations with his principal were extremely close. In addition to his official duties in the secretary of state's office, he had &#145;a free hand&#146; in managing Shelburne's personal finances  (ibid., 208) and did political work for him, notably in establishing an interest in the politics of the East India Company.<br>
<br>The company had been transformed into a great territorial power by the grant of authority over the rich province of Bengal made to it in 1765. The huge potential wealth to be derived from its new acquisitions drove up the price of the company's stock and made it an object of great interest to speculators. Macleane was quickly to the fore among them. As with West Indian land, he acted as agent for rich and ambitious men hoping for quick killings. Money was borrowed with which to buy stock on the assumption that good news from India would boost its price still further, enabling the loans to be paid back with a healthy margin of profit. A killing was duly made in 1766; Macleane's share of the profits may have been in the order of &pound;24,000  (Maclean, <span class="italic">Reward is Secondary</span>, 168). Macleane's involvement with East India Company affairs led him to be elected to the Commons in March 1768 as a member for Arundel in the interest of Sir George Colebrooke, at that time a rising power in the company and the other MP for the two-member seat. Macleane continued his speculative operations, culminating in what was called the &#145;great scheme&#146; of 1769 that was to ruin him and lose large sums for those who had entrusted their money to him. &pound;100,000 of stock was borrowed at an already high price. Far from going still higher, the price collapsed on the receipt of bad news from India. Macleane &#145;admitted that he owed &pound;90,000 (certainly a gross under estimate)&#146; (Sutherland and Woods, 330; Maclean, <span class="italic">Reward is Secondary</span>, 503n.). Among the casualties were Monckton and Shelburne, who, in addition to other sums lent to him, had advanced Macleane &pound;30,000 in a futile attempt to stave off disaster.<br>
<br>For the next few years Macleane, out of office after Shelburne resigned in June 1768, cast around for new lucrative openings that might enable him to accumulate funds with which to pay his debts. The years 1769 to January 1773, in which Macleane was living in London, coincided with the years in which British politics were shaken and fascinated by a series of anonymous letters that attracted a huge amount of public attention. The letters, denouncing ministers and ultimately the king himself, were published anonymously in the newspaper the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> under the name of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45912/', "Junius")</script>. The identity of Junius has never been conclusively established. Some contemporaries quickly concluded that it might be Macleane. Horace Walpole thought in April 1769 that &#145;opinions are divided&#146; between &#145;Mclean&#146; and two other contenders  (H. Walpole to Sir E. Walpole, 28 April 1769, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 36. 52). The possibility of Macleane's being Junius was periodically canvassed by subsequent investigators, but the fullest case was made in his biography published in 1963. James Maclean there argued that &#145;By first discussing Junius's career, and then comparing it with the contemporary career of Macleane, the salient features of both have been found to match, just as the negative of a film matches its positive print&#146;  (Maclean, <span class="italic">Reward is Secondary</span>, 418). In fact, he believed that the Junius letters were a team effort in which Macleane was assisted by some of his Scottish associates, whose friendship dated back to his student days in Edinburgh, and by his younger brother Henry. Other scholars have either found the case unconvincing or have been convinced by the claims of other contenders, Philip Francis usually being regarded as the strongest.<h2>
<a name="OfficerinBengal"></a>Officer in Bengal</h2>With Shelburne's loss of office and estrangement following the collapse of the &#145;great scheme&#146;, Macleane shifted his loyalty to the administration which, from 1770, was being consolidated under Lord North, whom he supported in parliament. In return for his services, he was given sinecure offices with a sizeable income attached, as superintendent of lazarettos (quarantine hospitals) in 1771 (upon which appointment he resigned his seat in the Commons), and then as non-resident collector of the Philadelphia customs in 1772. He angled for the governorship of Grenada, but he was set on India as the most promising avenue to a quick fortune. He had valuable allies in his quest. Colebrooke and another very powerful East India Company director, Laurence Sulivan, were both in desperate financial straits and were both owed money by Macleane. They had an obvious incentive to get him well placed in India in a position to pay his debts. His first bid was an appointment in July 1772 as a member of a commission of supervisors. When the commission was annulled he was appointed commissary of the army in Bengal, with the rank of colonel and the salary of a member of council and the right to trade on his own behalf. &#145;The absolute necessity of retrenching the excessive military charges&#146; of Bengal was the official rationale for the appointment  (Datta, 7.16); Laurence Sulivan, however, described the manoeuvrings among the directors to ensure Macleane's welfare, his own scheme for payment by commission being rejected when it was alleged that it would give Macleane &pound;50,000 a year  (Sulivan to W. Hastings, BL, Add. MS 29194, fol. 97).<br>
<br>Domestic tragedy struck Macleane just before he left for India. He had separated from his wife, Elizabeth, in 1769 and taken up with a rich widow, Penelope Agnew (1736&#150;1773), known as Penelope Forrester or as Mrs Macleane, with whom he had had two children. Penelope died on 2 May 1773 giving birth to the second of them, a daughter. In June 1773 Macleane set out for Calcutta. He found that the governor of Bengal, Warren Hastings, readily co-operated in plans for enlarging the scope and rewards of his office. Hastings, for his part, was charmed and impressed by Macleane and, like politicians in Britain, was willing to use him for confidential business. Macleane's prospects for lucrative service in Bengal were, however, blasted by the arrival of members appointed in Britain to make up a new supreme council. They quickly quarrelled with Hastings and took it on themselves to investigate maladministration and corruption. They found Macleane's activities a prime example of the &#145;irregular manner in which the Company's money affairs have been conducted&#146;  (minute of J. Clavering, G. Monson, and P. Francis, 14 Jan 1775, BL OIOC, H/118, p. 154). Macleane beat a retreat from Bengal, taking ship to Britain in January 1775.<h2>
<a name="AgentforthenawabofArcot"></a>Agent for the nawab of Arcot</h2>Macleane hoped to be reinstated in his office in Bengal, but he also had other opportunities of employment and enrichment in his sights. In the first place, he was to act in Britain as agent for Warren Hastings and to sustain his cause against his new enemies. He was paid &pound;10,000 from Hastings's funds in Britain. He successfully organized resistance to an attempt by the directors of the company to recall Hastings, but in the face of the ministry's determination to force Hastings out, by parliamentary action if need be, he thought it prudent to negotiate terms on which he handed in Hastings's resignation in September 1776. Although he had authorized Macleane to resign on his behalf if certain conditions were not met, Hastings subsequently disavowed his resignation and continued in office. By then, however, Macleane was concentrating on what he hoped would be a far more lucrative London agency, that of the nawab of Arcot.<br>
<br>Muhammad Ali Khan Walahjah had been supported by the British as claimant to the throne of the southern province of the Carnatic during the Seven Years' War. After the war he became increasingly uneasy at the protectorate which the company exercised over him and cast around for ways in which he could win effective independence from it. Establishing direct relations with the king of Great Britain instead of the company was one of his favourite strategies. On a short visit to Madras in March 1774 Macleane began to envisage a role for himself in forwarding the nawab's ambitions. He would represent the nawab in Britain and would negotiate a settlement on his behalf with the British government. When Macleane pointed out that he was allowed to trade in Bengal, the nawab replied that &#145;the best trade you can follow is my trade&#146;  (Macleane, &#145;Reasons&#146;, 13 Feb 1776, BL OIOC, H/286, p. 46). In January 1775 Macleane was empowered to act as the nawab's British agent. He was promised a salary of 12,000 pagodas (about &pound;1800) a year and expected generous gratuities.<br>
<br>In Britain Macleane lobbied for the nawab with ministers and with the company's directors and publicized his cause in the press. A petition to parliament was drafted but never presented. The nawab had, however, very ambitious expectations which even an adept and pertinacious agent had no hope of achieving. Nor was Macleane able to reap the advantages that he hoped for from his appointment. To pay off some of his creditors he drew bills on the nawab, including one of &pound;14,000 for Lord Shelburne  (Shelburne MSS, film 2019). The nawab failed to honour all such bills.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>In desperation Macleane made a quick return visit to Madras in 1777, &#145;leaving behind two pregnant mistresses&#146; in London  (Maclean, <span class="italic">Reward is Secondary</span>, 434). He embarked again for Britain on a naval ship the <i>Swallow</i>, which foundered, probably in the Bay of Biscay, in February 1778. Such expectations as his creditors might still have entertained were drowned with him.<br>
<br>Macleane's career was ultimately a disaster: he died insolvent, having dragged down many others in failed projects. Nevertheless, for a person without wealth or connections from a small village in co. Antrim, he had flown very high indeed for a time. His successes were no doubt due to ruthless determination, a willingness to take every sort of risk, together with a total lack of scruple. In addition, he was highly intelligent, had a ready pen, and was an adept negotiator. He also, however, had personal qualities that impressed many. Laurence Sulivan, by no means na&iuml;ve in the ways of the world, considered that &#145;his abilities are of the first magnitude, his fortitude superior to the most trying of disappointments and he has a heart replete with gratitude, and ever ready to support his friends and attachments to the hazard of life and fortune&#146;  (Sulivan to W. Hastings, BL, Add. MS 29194, fol. 97). In spite of a serious stammer and &#145;uncommon ugliness&#146;  (Maclean, <span class="italic">Reward is Secondary</span>, 20), he had a beguiling manner. &#145;No man living was ever so much of my confidence in so short an acquaintance&#146;, Warren Hastings wrote of him  (ibid., 320).<br>
