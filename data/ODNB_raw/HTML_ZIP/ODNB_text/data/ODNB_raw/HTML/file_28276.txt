<span class="headword">Vieuxpont <span class="st"> [Veteri Ponte, Vipont]</span>,  Robert  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1228), <span class="occ">administrator and magnate</span>, came of a family that took its name from Vieuxpont-en-Auge (Calvados) in Normandy. He was the younger son of William de Vieuxpont (<i>d</i>. in or before 1203), who became an important Anglo-Scottish landowner, and his wife, Maud de Morville (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1210), whose father Hugh (in 1170 one of the assassins of Thomas Becket) forfeited the barony of Westmorland in 1173. Robert's elder brother, Ivo, inherited their father's estates in Northamptonshire and Northumberland, while Robert had entered royal service by 1195, and was custodian of the honours of Peverel, Higham Ferrers, and Tickhill in the latter years of Richard I's reign. But he achieved much greater eminence under John. At first he was principally employed in Normandy, especially as a paymaster of troops and director of military works, including those on Rouen Castle, and in 1203 he became <i>bailli</i> of the Roumois. His services were rewarded by the grant of Vieuxpont itself, formerly held by an uncle who had joined the French, and also by grants in England. In February 1203 he was given custody of the castles of Appleby and Brough, to which the lordship of Westmorland was added a month later; then in October 1203 custody during pleasure was changed to a grant in fee simple, for the service of four knights, and Vieuxpont had become one of the leading barons in northern England. He was also to be given a number of valuable wardships, while his wife, Idonea, the daughter of John de Builli, whom he married before June 1213, brought him lands in Bedfordshire and a claim to the Yorkshire honour of Tickhill.<br>
<br>After leaving Normandy with John in December 1203 Vieuxpont was in frequent attendance on the king until the end of 1205, when he became increasingly involved in northern administration. In October 1204 he became sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, and so had control of the strategically important castle of Nottingham, which was also a major repository for royal treasure&#151;11,000 marks were sent there from Winchester in July 1207&#151;and thus a base for the king's authority. Employed in 1206 as a justice and assessor of tallage in the northern counties, in 1207 he was given custody of the see of York, and in April 1208 custody of that of Durham. His manifold responsibilities may have been more than he could handle, since at the end of 1208 he had to proffer 4000 marks for royal &#145;grace and favour&#146;, and undertake to submit a number of delayed accounts. But he was pardoned 3000 marks of his fine, and though he ceased to be sheriff of Nottingham he continued to be prominent in John's service. He held Durham until 1210, and in the following year was employed in Wales, as the king's lieutenant in Powys. His loyalty to John brought him the accolade of a place in Roger of Wendover's list of that king's evil counsellors, and John himself acknowledged Vieuxpont's reliability by temporarily placing his second son, Richard, and his niece Eleanor in his custody. He also continued to handle substantial sums of royal money&#151;in May 1213 he and Henry of Braybrooke received 30,000 marks from the king's treasure. He accompanied John to France in 1214, and in the civil war that broke out in the autumn of 1215 was one of the principal defenders of royal castles and interests in Yorkshire. In January 1216, moreover, he was entrusted with the custody of Cumberland and Carlisle Castle. He also had important interests of his own to defend in the north-west. His acquisition of Westmorland had been followed by an accumulation of estates in the region, including one on which he built a castle at Brougham, in order to defend his lordship against attack from the north&#151;the constable of Scotland, Alan of Galloway, had a claim to Westmorland through his mother, Helen de Morville, and occupied the lordship for a year when the Scots overran English Cumbria in 1216.<br>
<br>Vieuxpont fought for the young Henry III at Lincoln in 1217, but gave much trouble in the years that followed. He was said by Wendover to have continued to plunder after peace had been made, but greater difficulties arose from his claim to Tickhill, which was disputed by Alice, countess of Eu. In order to appease him for the time being the regency government, which had reappointed him sheriff of Cumberland in September 1217, conceded in the following year that he should hold that office without accounting for the profits of office until justice had been done on his claim to Tickhill. In the event he held Cumberland until 1222, without accounting for any issues at all. Having dislodged Alan of Galloway from Westmorland, he was by far the greatest figure in the north-west, which he governed with a heavy hand&#151;there were complaints over his administration of the royal forest in 1220 and 1225, and he quarrelled with William of Lancaster, lord of Kendal, over suits to Westmorland county court. He was not always fractious, however, and served as a justice itinerant in Yorkshire and Northumberland in 1218&#150;19. In 1222 the dispute over Tickhill was settled; Vieuxpont abandoned his claim to the honour, settling instead for six and a half knights' fees and &pound;100 in cash. A further consequence was that he immediately lost his shrievalty of Cumberland, and with it yearly revenues of nearly &pound;300. He may have been discontented, since at the end of 1223 he was one of the adversaries of the justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, protesting against the resumption of royal castles and sheriffdoms. But he had been reconciled to the government by February 1225, when he attested the reissue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, and in 1226&#150;7 headed a judicial eyre in Yorkshire. Although Vieuxpont was a benefactor to the Cumbrian monasteries of St Bees and Shap, in 1227 he bequeathed his body, along with his estate at Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, to the knights templar. The bequest itself, and the fact that its witnesses included a doctor, point to failing health, and by 1 February 1228 he was dead, probably very recently. He left a son and a daughter. The latter, Christian, he married to his ward, Thomas, son of William of Greystoke, the heir to the barony of Greystoke in Cumberland. His son and heir, John, died in 1241, his grandson, another Robert, in 1264. Divided between this younger Robert's daughters, the Vieuxpont inheritance was finally reassembled by the Cliffords, to form the basis of one of the greatest, and longest-lasting, northern lordships.<br>
