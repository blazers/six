<span class="headword">Despenser,  Edward</span>, first Lord Despenser  (1336&#150;1375), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was born at Essendine, Rutland, on 24 March 1336, the son and heir of Sir Edward Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1342)&#151;the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7554/', "Hugh Despenser the younger (d. 1326)")</script>&#151;and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1367), the daughter of William, Lord Ferrers of Groby. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7551/', "Henry Despenser")</script> was his brother. From his father, who died in 1342, Edward Despenser inherited substantial estates, including nine manors, mostly in the midlands, and in 1349 he succeeded his childless uncle, Hugh, second Lord Despenser (of the first creation), in the principal estates of the family. A profitable marriage was arranged, probably in 1346, between Despenser and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1409), granddaughter of Bartholomew Burghersh, the elder (<i>d</i>. 1355), a wealthy magnate who was the king's chamberlain. Elizabeth was the sole heir of her father, the younger <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4006/', "Bartholomew Burghersh")</script>, and his first wife, Cecily Weyland. This marriage, which took place before 2 August 1354, ultimately enabled Despenser, after his father-in-law's death in 1369, to acquire his wife's valuable estates, which comprised ten manors in Suffolk and half of the Welsh marcher lordship of Ewias Lacy.<br>
<br>Throughout Edward Despenser's minority the greater part of his lands was administered by his kinsfolk and officials on his behalf. After dower had been assigned to Hugh's widow, Elizabeth, the residue of the Despenser estates was farmed, on 8 February 1350, to Bartholomew Burghersh, the elder, and the young heir, for the probably undervalued sum of &pound;1000 a year. This custody was subsequently transferred to the Despenser heir and his mother, Lady Anne, on the same terms. Although he came of age in 1357, Edward Despenser did not have full possession of his family inheritance until after the death of the dowager, Elizabeth, in 1359.<br>
<br>Despenser's military career began before his coming of age in March 1357. With his father-in-law, Lord Burghersh, he was in the retinue of the Black Prince on his first expedition to Gascony in 1355, and he fought at Poitiers on 19 September 1356, when the French king, John II, was captured. He was still in Gascony in March 1357, and he probably returned to London with the prince of Wales during the following month. He was summoned to parliament in December 1357. When Edward III invaded France for the last time in October 1359, Despenser was one of the English magnates who served with the king, and he was still in France two years later. In 1361 he was made a knight of the Garter and given the stall next to the king's in St George's Chapel, Windsor. Meanwhile the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny, made in May 1360, had ended the most profitable phase of the French war.<br>
<br>Although Despenser was one of the Irish landowners who were commanded in February 1362 to go to Ireland to assist the king's third son, Lionel, to restore order in that land, it seems unlikely that he left England again until 1368. He was present in London when Lionel was created duke of Clarence on 13 November 1362, and it was in his service that he later enlisted. Despenser was the most important of the followers who accompanied Duke Lionel on his journey to Milan to marry Violante Visconti in May 1368, and he remained in Italy for over four years. After Lionel died suddenly on 17 October 1368, Despenser believed that his patron's death had been brought about by poison, and in revenge he took service with the pope, Urban V, in his war against the Visconti of Milan. On 10 March 1370 the pope wrote to John of Gaunt commending Despenser, who had won a great reputation by his prowess in battles in Lombardy. Despenser's prolonged sojourn in Italy appears to be commemorated in the fresco of <span class="roman">the church militant and triumphant</span> painted by Andrea da Firenze (Andrea Bonaiuti) and others in the Spanish chapel of Santa Maria Novella in Florence. This fresco depicts the meeting at Viterbo of Urban V and the emperor, Charles IV, on 17 October 1368; conspicuous in the group standing near the emperor is a knight of the Garter, clad in white, gold-embroidered garments. This figure, which portrays in profile a good-looking man with a short, reddish, pointed beard, has been identified as Edward, Lord Despenser, who was the only knight of the Garter in Italy at that time. If this identification is correct, he was the first Englishman to be portrayed in Italian art since Thomas Becket.<br>
<br>Despenser's exploits in Italy made him a renowned hero of chivalry. Froissart, who knew him personally and benefited from his patronage, eulogizes him as the most handsome, most courteous, and most honourable knight of his time in England, and relates that it was at the request of John of Gaunt that Despenser returned home in the summer of 1372. He was constable of Gaunt's army in the great <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> of 1373, when Gaunt marched across France from Calais to Bordeaux, losing half his troops on the way. The Breton expedition in the spring of 1375 was the last successful English undertaking in France in the late fourteenth century; Despenser, in company with Edmund of Langley, earl of Cambridge (afterwards duke of York), and Edmund Mortimer, earl of March, was attacking Quimperl&eacute; when this campaign was cut short by the truce of Bruges. After his return home Despenser visited Cardiff in September 1375; he died a few weeks later at his manor of Llanblethian, near Cowbridge, on 11 November, aged thirty-nine. His effigy on his tomb in Tewkesbury Abbey shows him in full armour, kneeling in prayer. His death was followed by another prolonged minority, since his surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7555/', "Thomas Despenser")</script>, was only two years old when his father died. The Despensers were an unlucky family; if Edward Despenser's career had not been prematurely cut short, his knightly prowess might well have earned him promotion to an earldom, a rank merited by his great landed possessions and his prestige as a famous military hero.<br>
