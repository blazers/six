<span class="headword">Sch&ouml;n,  Jacob Friederich <span class="st"> [James Frederick]</span></span>  (1803&#150;1889), <span class="occ">missionary and philologist</span>, was born at Ober Weiler, Baden. He trained at the Basel missionary seminary and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) College, Islington. Ordained deacon in 1831 and priest in 1832, he went to Sierra Leone where he worked for the next fifteen years. In Sierra Leone he began linguistic research, encouraged by Gustav N&yuml;lander, whose daughter Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1837), a CMS missionary of African descent, he married on 27 May 1835. Sch&ouml;n also learned Igbo and Hausa from recaptives (freed slaves), knowledge put to good use when he surveyed the languages of the lower Niger as the senior CMS representative on the British Niger expedition in 1841&#150;2. An account of the expedition was written in 1843 by Sch&ouml;n and a young African catechist and future bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, marking the beginning of a lifetime co-operation between the two men. Sch&ouml;n strongly believed in the value of native agency in missionary work, and of recaptive settlements as a means for the &#145;civilization&#146; and &#145;christianizing&#146; of Africa. Returning to Freetown, he concentrated on the study of Hausa, the language that was to be his life's work; his first publication on Hausa was in 1843, his last in 1888.<br>
<br>Sch&ouml;n's first wife died in 1837. In 1839 he married Cordelia Irving (<i>d</i>. 1840). Widowed a second time, he married, on 5 February 1841, Elizabeth White, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drake (<i>d</i>. 1892), the widow of James R. White. In 1847 ill health forced him to retire to Chatham, where he was appointed chaplain to the Melville Hospital for sailors. For the rest of his life Sch&ouml;n lived in Kent, and he was naturalized in 1854. He formally left the CMS in 1853 but he continued to study west African languages and to act as an unpaid adviser and editor for many CMS language publications in Temne, Mende, Nupe, Igbo, and Kanuri. However, Hausa was his major interest. In this he was aided by a young native speaker of Hausa, Dorugu, who spent much of his time between 1856 and 1864 living with the Sch&ouml;ns, a relationship which led to acrimonious controversy with the German traveller and linguist Heinrich Barth, who had brought him to Britain. African and black visitors frequently stayed with Sch&ouml;n either to learn a language or to contribute to his studies.<br>
<br>Sch&ouml;n's contribution to Hausa was a grammar (1862), followed by a dictionary (1876), various texts (1885&#150;6), and <span class="roman">Bible</span> translations (1857&#150;81). Maurice Delafosse called Sch&ouml;n &#145;the great discoverer of the Hausa language, inasmuch as his writings revealed it to Europe&#146;  (M. Delafosse, <span class="italic">Manuel de la langue haoussa</span>, 1901, ix), and Charles Henry Robinson wrote of him as &#145;the pioneer of Hausa study&#146;  (C. H. Robinson, <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Hausa Language</span>, 2nd edn, 1906, x). He was elected a member of the German Oriental Society, given the Volney medal by the Institut de France (1877), made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (1879), and made an honorary DD by Oxford University (1884). He had no formal training in linguistics but his methods, criticized by a later generation of Hausa scholars, were slow and thorough. As an evangelical he regarded linguistic work as a means of promoting the spread of the Christian gospel. As he told the CMS in 1881, &#145;I am no linguist by profession&#146;  (Hair, 52), although his contribution to orthography influenced the future writing of west African languages, and his use of Roman script determined how modern Hausa would be written. Sch&ouml;n also demonstrated energy and thoroughness in the last decade of his life when, as P. E. H. Hair wrote, he &#145;published as much as in any previous decade, and cleared his shelves of almost all of his remaining manuscripts&#146;  (Hair, 53).<br>
<br>Sch&ouml;n was gentle, kindly, and, as demonstrated by his first marriage and friendships, without any sense of racial superiority. As Robert Cust wrote in an appreciation, his life was like his name, &#145;beautiful&#146;  (Cust, March 1889, 36). Sch&ouml;n died at his home, Palm Cottage, New Brompton, Kent, on 30 March 1889. Following a funeral service at St Mark's, Gillingham, the family church, he was buried in Gillingham cemetery. He was survived by his third wife, Elizabeth, and at least nine children. At a Lambeth dinner David Livingstone had said to Archbishop Sumner of Sch&ouml;n: &#145;This man's name, your Grace, will live generations after mine has been forgotten&#146;  (Cust, March 1889, 36). However, Sch&ouml;n was ignored in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> and more than a century later his name is known only to specialists.<br>
