<span class="headword">Lush, Sir  Robert</span>  (1807&#150;1881), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Shaftesbury, Dorset, on 25 October 1807, the eldest son of Robert Lush of Shaftesbury, and his wife, Lucy, daughter of Joseph Foote of Tollard, Wiltshire. He was educated at a school in Shaftesbury and afterwards spent several years in a solicitor's office. In 1836 he entered himself as a student at Gray's Inn. He published several law books before he was called to the bar. <span class="italic">The Act for the Abolition of Arrest on Mesne Process</span> appeared in 1838, together with a treatise on the <span class="roman">Wills Act</span>. In October 1840 <span class="italic">The practice of the superior courts of common law at Westminster in actions and proceedings over which they have a common jurisdiction</span> was published; it became a standard work on common-law practice and ran to several editions. The editor of the third edition (1855) was James Stephen, the eminent professor of jurisprudence at King's College, London.<br>
<br>In 1839 Lush married Elizabeth Ann (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of the Revd Christopher Woollacott of London. They had several children, including at least four sons. Two of these became prominent lawyers: Herbert W. Lush, KC and judge, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34635/', "Sir (Charles) Montague Lush QC")</script>. Another, suffering from delirium, committed suicide, and the fourth died suddenly and unexpectedly.<br>
<br>Having practised for a short time as a special pleader, Lush was called to the bar by Gray's Inn on 18 November 1840, and joined the home circuit. Until 1857, when he became a queen's counsel and a bencher of Gray's Inn, he was a busy junior. In 1842 he edited the common-law portion of <span class="italic">Chitty's General Practice of the Law</span>. Although he was small and unassuming, his learning and clarity of expression gave him instant success in commercial practice. He attached himself to the court of common pleas, and shared with Sir William Bovill the lead of the home circuit. He never sat in parliament. He was, as Lord Westbury wrote of him, &#145;a very learned and distinguished man&#146;, who, &#145;so far as I know, has no politics at all&#146;  (Nash, 69).<br>
<br>On 30 October 1865 Lush succeeded Mr Justice Crompton in the court of queen's bench. He was one of the three judges who tried the Tichborne claimant. When the <span class="roman">Judicature Acts</span> came into force in November 1875, he sat in chambers for many weeks drafting the rules of practice with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14803/', "Sir George Jessel")</script>. Lush was a member of the judicature commission and of the commission on the penal code in 1878. Afterwards, in May 1879, while still a puisne judge, he was appointed a member of the privy council by Lord Beaconsfield. In October 1880 he succeeded Lord Justice Thesiger in the Court of Appeal, but his health soon failed, and on 27 December 1881 he died at his home, 60 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, London.<br>
