<span class="headword">Wyggeston <span class="st"> [Wigston]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1467&#150;1536), <span class="occ">merchant and benefactor</span>, belonged to a family originating at Wigston, just outside Leicester, whose members were by the fifteenth century established as wealthy wool merchants in Coventry and in Leicester itself. The family name is variously spelt: in Leicester its standard form became Wyggeston, whereas at Coventry it was usually recorded as Wigston. Between 1448 and 1520 the family provided five mayors of Leicester, four of whom also represented the borough in parliament. There survives in Leicester, behind an eighteenth-century frontage, a late medieval timber-framed house believed to have been the home of Roger Wyggeston (<i>d</i>. 1507), three times mayor.<br>
<br>William Wyggeston, who was probably born in Leicester, was the eldest son of Roger's brother John (<i>d</i>. 1513), who also became mayor, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1519/20). Admitted a freeman of the borough in 1493&#150;4, William was elected mayor in 1499 and 1510, and MP in 1504. He controlled his family's business in his home town, sending wool to Calais, the principal town for the sale of English wool on the continent, and serving four times as mayor of the staple there, in that capacity overseeing the merchants who had the monopoly of dealing in wool for export. Bequests in his will suggest that he continued to trade to Calais until the end of his life. In Leicester he became by far the richest man of his time: the subsidy roll for 1524 shows that he owned 22 per cent of the taxable property in the town, while his assessment for taxation was &pound;600, six times higher than that of the next richest resident, who was Wyggeston's own cousin, also named William and also a former mayor. He married twice. His first wife, Isabel, sister of Richard Gillott (another mayor of Leicester), died at an unknown date, and about 1509 he married Agnes, widow of William Ford and daughter of William Pysford&#151;both men were Coventry merchants. There were no children of either of his marriages.<br>
<br>In 1511, with his brothers Thomas and Roger, William Wyggeston endowed a chantry in the collegiate church of St Mary in the Newarke, Leicester. Thomas had been a prebendary of the college since 1501 and resided there, although he was also rector of two Leicestershire parishes. A chantry chapel, with latten screens, was erected in the church nave; it was served by two priests, for whom Wyggeston built a house that survives as part of the Newarke Houses Museum, with his arms over the door. In due course William was buried in the church (which was destroyed in or soon after 1548), alongside his wives, his parents, and his brother Thomas.<br>
<br>The career of <a name="cosubject_94980"></a><span class="headword">Roger Wigston</span>  (1482/3&#150;1542), the youngest brother of William, took a rather different course. He, too, was a <span class="occ">wool merchant</span>, but in Coventry (hence the spelling of his name). And though he both grew and exported wool, he achieved prominence less through trade than as a <span class="occ">lawyer</span>. In 1514, aged about thirty, he was admitted to the Inner Temple, and by 1524 had been appointed recorder of Coventry. As well as acting as counsel to a number of monastic houses, he was often employed by the crown. He served on numerous commissions in the west midlands, became receiver-general of the duchy of Lancaster honour of Tutbury in 1528, was named to the council in the marches of Wales in 1534, and in 1536 was appointed a commissioner for the survey of religious houses in Warwickshire. He sat in parliament for Leicester in 1523, but thereafter represented Coventry, which returned him in 1529, probably in 1536, in 1539, and in 1542. He was sheriff of Leicestershire and Warwickshire in 1541&#150;2. As well as acquiring estates in both those counties Roger Wigston became steward of Pinley Priory, a small Cistercian nunnery a few miles west of Warwick (where the last prioress, Margaret Wigston, was probably a kinswoman), which later came into the possession of his son. He also leased Wolston Priory, a former alien cell which had come into the possession of the Coventry Carthusians, as a residence, and then bought it after the Charterhouse's dissolution. Before 1509 he married Christian, daughter of Edward Langley and widow of William Pye, with whom he had two sons and five daughters. Roger Wigston died on 27 November 1542 and was buried at Wolston.<br>
<br>Roger Wigston is not known to have resented the disappearance of the monasteries. His eldest brother, William Wyggeston, appears to have been a lifelong traditionalist in matters of religion. Soon after his chantry foundation William's thoughts turned towards charity, perhaps influenced by the fact that his second wife's first husband had founded an almshouse, Ford's Hospital, in Coventry; in 1529, with the authority of Ford's executors, William amended the statutes of that foundation. In 1513 he obtained statutes licensing him, along with Thomas and Roger and the priest William Fisher, to found an almshouse in Leicester for twelve poor men and twelve poor women. Wyggeston's Hospital, which had a chapel dedicated to Our Lady, St Katherine, and St Ursula, was built by the churchyard of St Martin's (Leicester Cathedral since 1926). William Fisher was its first master. Wyggeston endowed it with lands in Leicestershire and other counties, notably Lincolnshire and Staffordshire. The manor of Swannington, in a coal-mining area north-west of Leicester, was particularly important, since it came to be of considerable value.<br>
<br>William Wyggeston died at Leicester on 8 July 1536. His will shows that he had remained a wealthy man. Following numerous individual bequests, he divided the residue of his estate into three portions, one of which was to be &#145;disposed in works of Mercy and Piety&#146; at the discretion of his executors, who included his widow, Agnes, and his brother Thomas. But although he is commonly regarded as having founded not only Wyggeston's Hospital but also the Wyggeston Schools in Leicester, the credit for the latter may in fact belong to Agnes and Thomas, though they may well have been using money from William's residuary estate. A later deed indicates that they conveyed a sum to trustees to support a schoolmaster to teach grammar, and John Leland, who visited Leicester in 1539, only two or three years after Thomas's death, describes him as having &#145;made the fre Grammar Schole&#146;  (Leland, 1.16). A new school was built in 1573, a grant was made to it from the revenues of the duchy of Lancaster, and between 1572 and 1574 new statutes were issued for the hospital which linked it to the grammar school.<br>
<br>Wyggeston's hospital and schools are still to be found in Leicester, having undergone many changes. The hospital was rebuilt on Hinckley Road in 1866&#150;7, and the original building, with its chapel, was demolished in 1875. A boys' school, successor to the grammar school, was opened on the site of the hospital in 1877, funded from surplus endowments, Wyggeston's almshouse having become wealthy from the value of the lands he settled on it. A girls' school followed a year later. All these developments owed much to the efforts of Canon David James Vaughan, master of the hospital and a keen worker for education in Leicester. In the twentieth century both schools were moved to new premises, while the hospital was again entirely rebuilt, with a unit for the frail and elderly being added in 1992. It was named Agnes House, after Agnes Wyggeston, each of whose two husbands had founded a charitable institution still functioning after nearly 500 years.<br>
