<span class="headword">Young,  George Frederick</span>  (1791&#150;1870), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and politician</span>, was born at 4 Torrington Street, Ratcliffe Highway, London, the second son of thirteen children of Vice-Admiral William Young (1761&#150;1847) and Ann, daughter of Robert Curling, shipbuilder. Young's father, after service in the American and Napoleonic wars, acted as inspecting agent for transports in the Thames (1805&#150;30), but was also the partner of Robert Curling in the firm Curling, Young &amp; Co. Young was mainly educated at home, and in 1814 he married Mary (<i>c</i>.1790&#150;1876), youngest daughter of John Abbot, brewer, of Canterbury. The couple had eight children.<br>
<br>By the 1820s Young had become the leading partner in Curling, Young &amp; Co., by then one of the most prominent firms in the London shipping industry. Having specialized in building East Indiamen, it went on, in the 1830s, to produce some of Britain's most notable passenger steamships, including the <i>Victoria</i> (later <i>British Queen</i>), as well as gunships during the South African War. Young played an important part in the master shipbuilders' conflicts with John Gast's shipwrights' union in the mid-1820s, although his paternalist strain was seen in his support for a worker's pension scheme with over 1000 members by 1830. Besides shipbuilding, Young acquired extensive interests in colonial trade and shipping, especially in whaling. He was also an enthusiastic traveller in Britain and Europe.<br>
<br>A zealous administrator, Young was a member of the committee at Lloyd's (Shipping Register) 1824&#150;34, helped to amalgamate the two shipping registers in 1834, and served on Lloyd's new permanent committee, 1835&#150;67, its longest-serving founder member. He was also a driving force in the General London Ship Owners' Society, which in 1834 he chaired for the first of an unprecedented six occasions. This was a period when, following the relaxation of the navigation laws introduced by William Huskisson, shipping questions were of growing political importance, and it was largely as a spokesman of the shipping interest that Young was elected MP for the new constituency of Tynemouth in 1832.<br>
<br>Young proved a vigorous defender of the shipping interest in and outside the House of Commons, for example, sternly resisting (and seeking to reverse) the liberalization of the navigation laws, but supporting the ending of impressment, and advocating marine schools. According to Dickens, he earned the reputation of &#145;a prodigious bore in Parliament, by speaking immediately before every division, great or small, to the anguish and horror of all parties&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 5.6&#150;8). Associated at times with Joseph Hume, and in Tower Hamlets with the idiosyncratic naval reformer and novelist Captain Frederick Marryat, Young mostly took the whig whip, although he opposed the new poor law. He joined the &#145;Derby Dilly&#146; in 1834&#150;5, but subsequently supported the whigs on the appropriation of Irish church revenues. He continued to stand as a &#145;moderate&#146; and &#145;independent&#146; Liberal/whig at Tynemouth, drawing on cross-party support, but was not inaccurately described by one of his radical opponents as &#145;in heart a tory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tynemouth Leaflets</span>, 26 June 1832, British Library). Having been unopposed in 1835, his narrow re-election in 1837 was followed by his unseating on technical grounds in 1838.<br>
<br>By the 1840s Young's shipping connections and his growing interest in colonial reform led him to join tory shipowners and radical Wakefieldians in the colonization of New Zealand. Young himself purchased land there, looking to New Zealand as &#145;a colony, better calculated than any belonging to the British Crown, to prove a blessing to our poor countrymen, and a mine of wealth and a source of power to the nation&#146;  (G. F. Young to F. Yeldham, 22 May 1846, Young MSS, BL). He was a leading working director of the New Zealand Company, chairing its shipping committee. Under its auspices, Young's son William Curling travelled to New Zealand but died soon after arrival in 1842. Ironically, he was soon to have been joined there by the poet and future prime minister of New Zealand, Alfred Domett, a close friend, and member, with Robert Browning and Christopher Dowson (1807&#150;1848), of the &#145;Colloquials&#146; who met regularly at the Young home, conscientiously managed by his wife.<br>
<br>A critic of Conservative colonial policy under Sir Robert Peel and Stanley, Young's domestic politics now led him away from both main parties towards advocacy of &#145;Young England&#146; principles in the poorest districts of London, supporting for example, baths and washhouses as a means towards the reconciliation of classes. Unlike many of his fellow shipowners, Young lived near to his yards, and was intimately involved in the local community. He acted as chairman of the house committee of the London Hospital (1842&#150;4), helped to create Victoria Park, and, for many years, chaired the Stepney board of guardians. Under its aegis, he was instrumental in setting up the Limehouse children's establishment (1838&#150;73), much visited by educational reformers and philanthropists, and recommended by Dickens as a model to Angela Burdett Coutts. Young was also active as a JP (and deputy lieutenant) for Middlesex.<br>
<br>Young's concern for &#145;the producing classes&#146; as well as for shipping and the empire as the fulcrums of national power led him, in the late 1840s, to become one of the most active, as well as the most bitter, of the opponents of free trade, especially of the repeal of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>. To resisting the latter he devoted indefatigable energies, giving influential evidence to the select committees of 1847, writing extensively in pamphlets and the press, and seeking to construct an alliance of the disparate opponents of free trade among shipowners, agriculturists, colonial merchants, and working men. Setting up the National Association for the Protection of British Industry and Capital in May 1849, he was ready to woo earls, dukes, farmers, seamen, and the Chartist National Association of Organised Trades. He forced Benjamin Disraeli on to the defensive (over his apparently dwindling support for protection) and became for a time a vital force in the protectionist politics of the late 1840s and early 1850s. In 1851 he was elected protectionist MP for Scarborough and, had his health not broken under the strain of his political advocacy, he would have become vice-president of the Board of Trade in Derby's administration of 1852. For some contemporaries, Young's &#145;absurd protectionist views&#146; did the shipping interest &#145;much more harm than good&#146;  (W. S. Lindsay, journal IA, fol. 622, Lindsay MSS, NMM), but modern judgements have treated more sympathetically the protectionist ideology which Young so vigorously espoused.<br>
<br>Defeated in the general election of 1852, Young largely faded into obscurity, although in 1860 he characteristically opposed the Anglo-French commercial treaty as an imprudent and humiliating sacrifice of British power. With the erosion of protection in the early 1840s, he had already begun to abandon shipowning, especially since the whaling trade was now exposed to growing American competition, while his shipbuilding business found itself very much at the declining end of the industry, with the onset of iron-building and the consequent moving of this industry from the Thames to the north of England. But Young retained his links with the shipping interest through Lloyd's Register and the General London Ship Owners' Society, which he chaired for the last time in 1862.<br>
<br>Young had left Limehouse in the late 1840s, firstly for Walthamstow, but subsequently, in straitened circumstances, for Reigate, where he died on 23 February 1870 at Wray Park Road. He was buried in the churchyard of Reigate parish church. His wife survived him. Among his eight children, his eldest surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40988/', "Sir Frederick Young (1817&#150;1913)")</script>, inherited his colonial enthusiasm, becoming a leading member of the Royal Colonial Institute and an early publicist of imperial federation, while Sidney (1821&#150;1915), having taken over the family firm, later became merchant assessor for the Admiralty division of the royal courts, where his arbitrations included the <i>Alabama</i> claims.<br>
