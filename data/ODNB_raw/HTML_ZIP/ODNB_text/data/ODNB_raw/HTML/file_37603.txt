<span class="headword">Jessop,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1603, <em>d.</em> 1675), <span class="occ">government official and politician</span>, was baptized in Stafford on 22 September 1603, the son of Thomas Jessoppe, and his wife, Margery. He moved to London, becoming a law clerk and then confidential man of business to Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick. Jessop served as secretary or chief clerk to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95346', "Providence Island Company")</script> from 1631 to 1641, and to the Saybrook plantation trustees; his command of shorthand (then known as secret writing) must have been a valuable qualification. In 1640 he was on familiar terms with John Pym, his colleague as treasurer of the Providence Island Company. With the outbreak of civil war in 1642 he moved into both military and naval administration. When his patron ceased to be parliament's lord admiral, with the passage of the self-denying ordinance in 1645, Jessop stayed on as secretary to the admiralty commissioners, holding this post until the demise of the Rump Parliament in 1653. Through his service under the war treasurers in 1642, Jessop had also become man of business to Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, and served conscientiously as an executor of the former lord general's encumbered estate after his death in 1646.<br>
<br>Jessop had considerable scruples about taking the engagement, the oath of loyalty to the republic; the abolition of the House of Lords seems to have upset him more than the 1649 regicide and abolition of the monarchy. He may have found service under the protectorate more congenial than that of the Commonwealth; in 1653&#150;4 he moved from the navy to the central executive, becoming assistant secretary and then clerk of Oliver Cromwell's council and treasurer of the protector's contingencies. He also served on numerous other committees and commissions. In the 1659 parliament he sat for his old home town; in one of his two recorded speeches he had to justify having arrested a leading Fifth Monarchy man on the orders of the late lord protector. His Cromwellian sympathies were no doubt strengthened by the marriage of the protector's younger daughter to the earl of Warwick's grandson early in 1658, and not surprisingly he left public life altogether with the restoration of the Commonwealth in 1659. This and his aristocratic connections served him well at the Restoration. He was assistant clerk of the parliaments in the Convention of 1660, a witness against the regicides, and briefly employed under the navy commissioners. Due either to age or to lack of an appropriate patron, he held no central office again until 1668&#150;9, when he was secretary to the public accounts committee, the body charged with investigating whether financial malpractice had contributed to the naval disaster at the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Jessop held two offices in the duchy of Lancaster without a break, from the 1650s until his death.<br>
<br>Jessop married first Margaret Edwin, and second Mary Cox, widow and sister-in-law of a politically moderate parliamentarian colonel. His daughter by his first wife, and only child, married into the Hulton family of Lancashire, which accounts for the survival of his papers in the county record office at Preston and in the British Library. He died in London, at his house in Holborn, in March 1675. His efficiency and discretion are as evident from the record as is his dislike of political extremism.<br>
