<span class="headword">Rand,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1654), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the eldest surviving son of the Revd James Rand (<i>d</i>. 1621), vicar of Norton, co. Durham (1578&#150;1621) and prebend of Durham Cathedral (1606&#150;20), and his wife, Margery, daughter of the Revd Edward Banckes, rector of Long Newton, co. Durham, was baptized at Norton on 18 August 1588. His early schooling was probably in Stockton. He matriculated as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, his father's college, at Easter 1606, and became BA in 1610, and MA in 1613. He may also have studied at St Andrew's in 1612; his cousin, Ralph Rand, took an MA at St Andrew's in that same year. Samuel Rand was admitted on the medical line at Leiden on 2 September 1616, but he took his MD from Groningen in the following year, on 18 August 1617. He dedicated his thesis on vertigo to his uncle, the Revd Ralph Rand, rector and &#145;minister of the word of God&#146; at Oxted, Surrey. There is no record that Rand ever incorporated his foreign degree at either Oxford or Cambridge.<br>
<br>Rand did not begin to practise medicine in London until 1624. It is likely that prior to that date he practised near his family's home district in the north-east of England. On 3 February 1626 Rand was reprimanded for abusing his College of Physicians licence to practise outside London, by doing so within the City. By 6 July 1626 he had somehow satisfied the requirement of incorporation and was elected a candidate; he became a fellow on 22 December 1630.<br>
<br>While practising as a prominent London physician, Rand also became an investor in the colonization of the British West Indies and in particular in the plantation of the island of Tortuga, which was organized by a relative, Anthony Hilton, a shipmaster from Durham. On the death of Hilton in 1635, Rand purchased his estate for Hilton's widow, in order to keep it out of the hands of her late husband's creditors. On 8 August 1631 he consulted with John Clarke of the College of Physicians during the terminal illness of William Nethersole. Rand and Clarke were both products of the intensely puritan Christ's College, Cambridge, and their relationship may well have gone back to their Cambridge days. They were also both signatories to a college petition in 1632 to Charles I, which implored the king to curb the improper medical activities of London apothecaries who prescribed without the direction of a physician. In 1633 Rand purchased a pedigree from the College of Arms on its visitation of London. In September 1635, along with Dr Othowell Meverell and Dr William Clement of the College of Physicians, he attended the mother of John Evelyn in her final illness. <br>
<br>Rand is listed in the annals of the Royal College of Physicians as practising in Newcastle by 13 January 1637. The ostensible reason for his departure was to take up the position as town physician to Newcastle upon Tyne. He held this post until 21 April 1643, when he was removed by royalist sympathizers. However, in September 1644 parliament appointed him master of Greatham Hospital, Durham. A strong puritan as well as a parliamentarian, Rand was elected an elder in the Presbyterian classis at Stockton, co. Durham, in December 1645. In 1647 he was elected by town authorities at Newcastle as one of four elders to assist the Presbyterian minister, Richard Prideaux, at All Saints' parish, in the city. He was restored as town physician to Newcastle in 1652. Rand died in 1654 and was buried at Gateshead, co. Durham, on 8 March.<br>
