<span class="headword">Clegg,  John Atherton</span>  (1913&#150;1987), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 15 May 1913 at 6 Moor Close, Middleton, Manchester, the son of Albert Clegg, a compositor, and his wife, Mabel Webster. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Middleton, before completing an honours degree in physics at the University of Manchester in 1935. He qualified as a secondary school teacher the following year, and took up (after a succession of temporary posts) a job as physics master at Middlesbrough high school. In 1940 he was recruited to work at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), the major site of British radar development. The rapid expansion of the chain home coastal radar system relied on the training of staff, and after two years of radar research Clegg's teaching skills were mobilized as deputy head of TRE's teaching school. In 1943 Clegg married Marjorie Fuller (<i>d</i>. 1986). He finished the war at the Ministry of Aircraft Production headquarters in London.<br>
<br>As the Second World War was ending, many scientists returned to the universities armed with new techniques, equipment, and useful government and industrial contacts. Clegg, after preliminary arrangements to work on cosmic rays at Birkbeck College, was persuaded to join Professor Patrick M. S. Blackett's physics department in Manchester. On his return to his city of birth in 1946, Clegg, an expert on aerials, began work at Jodrell Bank, a Cheshire outpost of Blackett's department where Bernard Lovell was assembling ex-military equipment and staff to investigate radar echoes of unclear origin. The Jodrell Bank team soon identified the radar echoes with the trails of meteors. Since their technique of investigation was relatively undisturbed by the sun, the radar team soon found and published details about previously unsuspected daytime meteor showers. Clegg used his knowledge of radio wave propagation, learned during his wartime work, to assist the team's efforts to calculate orbital information from meteor trail reflections. Jodrell Bank's use of this information to claim that sporadic meteors were not of interstellar origin was one of the first interventions of radio techniques into astronomy.<br>
<br>Clegg was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1950. With Lovell he published <span class="italic">Radio Astronomy</span>, one of the first books on the subject, in 1952. He played a major part in designing and building the first elements of Jodrell Bank's pioneering radio telescope in 1946&#150;7, but he did not publish on any observations made with it.<br>
<br>Reminiscing in the 1970s Clegg recalled that his enjoyment of radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank diminished as the research station grew and the work became more routine and team orientated. Troubled also by his health, Clegg moved back to the physics laboratories in Manchester in 1951 to assist Blackett with his investigations of rock magnetism. Blackett was interested in the possibility that a massive rotating body could possess a magnetic moment independent of any electric currents within it. The extremely sensitive magnetometer he designed to measure the effect was also suited to measuring the magnetic field trapped in rock. A paper published by Clegg with Mary Almond (who had also worked at Jodrell Bank in the early years) and P. H. S. Stubbs in 1954 claimed that measurements from rocks collected from sites across the United Kingdom showed that the land mass had rotated clockwise by over 30&deg; since the Triassic period. Such claims bolstered the emerging theory of continental drift.<br>
<br>When Blackett left Manchester in 1953 to be appointed professor at Imperial College, Clegg went with him, continued the research on rock magnetism, and took up the post of lecturer in physics. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1956, and reader the following year. In 1961 he was given leave of absence and seconded to Ibadan, Nigeria, as professor of physics; however, he once again suffered ill health, this time a viral complaint. On return to London he began teaching again, and was senior tutor of Imperial College physics department from 1967 to 1974. Contemporaries remember him as an excellent pedagogue, and he passed on this experience in his later years as an education consultant for the Institute of Physics. He retired in 1977 and died at 42 Shelley Road, Worthing, of heart failure on 28 August 1987.<br>
