<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sprimont,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1715, <em>d.</em> 1771), <span class="occ">goldsmith and porcelain manufacturer</span>, was baptized in Li&egrave;ge on 23 January 1715, the son of Pierre Sprimont and Gertrude Goffin, and may have been apprenticed there to his uncle Nicholas Joseph Sprimont (<i>c</i>.1678&#150;1744). Given his knowledge of French silver and porcelain it is likely that he also trained in Paris. His presence in London is recorded in 1742, when he took on his first apprentice, James Lamistre, and in November married Ann Protin at Knightsbridge Chapel. Sprimont entered his mark at Goldsmiths' Hall on 25 January 1743, when he was working in Compton Street, Soho. In September 1744 he stood godfather to Sophie, daughter of the French sculptor Louis Fran&ccedil;ois Roubiliac, at the Huguenot church in Spring Gardens; this suggests that he himself was a Huguenot. It is known that one model used by him while he was proprietor of the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory was based on a Roubiliac original&#151;that of the painter William Hogarth's pug dog Trump, which dates from 1747&#150;50 (V&amp;A). In 1745 it was stipulated that a large panel of Chelsea porcelain should be incorporated into the base relief of Roubiliac's monument to Bishop Hough in Worcester Cathedral.<h2>
<a name="Thegoldsmith"></a>The goldsmith</h2>Sprimont's documented silver is rare and bears date marks for 1743 to 1747. Of the four salts in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle (1742&#150;3) one, supported on a crayfish, is similar to salts made in the early years of the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory. The crayfish are so lifelike that they may well have been cast from nature. The sauceboats and stands in the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace (1743&#150;5), in the form of shells on dolphins, support figures of Venus and Adonis. These salts and sauceboats form part of a larger service made for Frederick, prince of Wales, on which Sprimont worked in collaboration with the goldsmith <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67426/', "Paul Crespin (1693/4&#150;1770)")</script>. The centrepiece of 1741&#150;2 bears Crespin's mark but the shell support under the bowl has Turin marks and may be the work of Lorenzo Lavi, who later worked in Paris. Dominated by a central figure of Poseidon the bowl is supported by four dolphins and the raised arms of two mermaids. Four dishes that complete the service are unmarked but have been attributed to Sprimont. This royal service was evidently a complex combined effort incorporating the work of several foreign craftsmen. A payment of &pound;149 to Sprimont, recorded in the receipt book of Charles, fifth Lord Baltimore, in January 1745, was probably for this royal service (particularly as Baltimore made an earlier payment to Paul Crespin in April 1743 for &pound;89 3<i>s</i>.). Lord Baltimore served as gentleman of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales and may have served as his agent for this commission. Other important commissions include a tea kettle (1745), formerly in the Russian royal collection (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg); a set of six shell-shaped sauceboats (1746&#150;7) made for Thomas Watson, earl of Winchilsea and Nottingham (Boston Museum of Fine Arts); and the 1747 centrepiece made for the second earl of Ashburnham (V&amp;A). The latter is in the form of a tureen supported by young goats and may have been intended for use as a fruit basket. The Ashburnham centrepiece is close in design to a soup tureen made for the duke of Somerset, dated 1740 and marked by Paul Crespin (Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio). An epergne made by the royal goldsmiths John Parker and Edward Wakelin for the duke of Bolton in 1760 has a similarly complex design. The similarities of these elaborate centrepieces suggest that Sprimont may have designed all three but close examination reveals no connection in their casting, finishing, and facture.<h2>
<a name="TheChelseaPorcelainManufactory"></a>The Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory</h2>Sprimont's involvement with the foundation of the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory probably dates from September 1744, when his presence in Chelsea is first recorded; he leased a house in Church Lane East, for which he took out an insurance policy. He was encouraged to venture into porcelain making by a &#145;casual acquaintance with a chemist&#146; who has been named as d'Ostermann, a German  (Mallet, <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, 432). The Huguenot Charles Gouyn (<i>d</i>. 1785), a jeweller from Dieppe, was senior partner in the enterprise until about 1748, when he left to set up the &#145;girl in a swing&#146; factory in the West End. In 1751 Gouyn described himself in a newspaper advertisement as &#145;late Proprietor and Chief Manager of the Chelsea-House&#146;.<br>
<br>The earliest products of the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory are marked by an incised triangle and include salt cellars in the form of crayfish based on a silver prototype. By 1747 Sprimont was also occupying Monmouth House, Lawrence Street, Chelsea&#151;at that time the factory showroom&#151;which backed onto the Church Lane property. Although production was in Chelsea sales were later conducted from a warehouse in Pall Mall, and the Lawrence Street site became a manufactory from 1749. The business was closed for a year in 1749&#150;50 for reorganization and expansion.<br>
<br>Contemporary newspapers advertised the range of new stock, which was marked with a raised anchor. The earliest advertisement, of 1749, lists luxury products including tea, coffee, and chocolate services, plates, dishes, and all table utensils. Many of these pieces were based on Meissen prototypes. In 1754 porcelain toys, snuffboxes, smelling bottles, etwees, trinkets, enamel-painted watches, and porcelain hafts for table and dessert knives and forks were also listed. These pieces were marked with an anchor in underglaze red. A scent bottle and candle nozzle found on the site of the property in Church Lane East suggests that the &#145;red anchor&#146; toys were made there. Such toys had been made in silver for export by Sprimont's former business associate Paul Crespin. Traditionally supplied by jewellers, such stock may have been inspired also by Sprimont's brother Jean Piers, who was a working jeweller in Li&egrave;ge. The Chelsea toys were intended for wholesale to jewellers, goldsmiths, toyshops, and cutlers.<br>
<br>The Chelsea porcelain was designed to appeal to rich, fashionable, and aristocratic clients and to replace expensive foreign imports. Clients included Queen Charlotte, who in 1763 ordered a service for her brother Duke Adolphus Frederick IV of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. About 1752&#150;3 Sprimont addressed an anonymous plea to the government to curb the import of porcelain from the Meissen factory entitled &#145;The case of the undertaker of the Chelsea manufacture of porcelain ware&#146;. Meissen was brought into the country by patrons for their own use but inevitably sold on at auction and by the London chinamen. Sprimont wrote:<blockquote>considerable parcels are now allowed to pass at the Custom House, as for private use, by which means the shops abound with new stock, and public sales are advertised at the very beginning of the winter, and in large quantities. (Jewitt, 171&#150;2)</blockquote>About the same time Sprimont deliberately arranged to copy examples of Meissen porcelain. Sir Everard Fawkener wrote to Dresden on behalf of the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory, asking the British envoy, Sir Charles Hanbury-Williams, to send &#145;over fifty or threescore pounds' worth of models for copying&#146;  (Clarke, 111). Sprimont also arranged to borrow pieces in private ownership, from Henry Fox at Holland House, Kensington. From 1756, during the Seven Years' War, supplies of Meissen porcelain ceased and even French competition was virtually eliminated. Sprimont responded by developing a line in vases in the French manner. He continued to attract financial support for his venture; Sir Everard Fawkener, a rich Turkey merchant and secretary to the duke of Cumberland, paid Sprimont sums totalling &pound;1495 between 1746 and 1748. Fawkener held a large stock in the manufactory until 1757, when it closed for a year due to Sprimont's illness. When it reopened a gold anchor was used as the mark.<h2>
<a name="Designerandproprietor"></a>Designer and proprietor</h2>Sprimont was an accomplished draughtsman. A signed design for a tureen that bears the arms of Thomas Coke, earl of Leicester (Sprimont's landlord in Chelsea; V&amp;A), must date from 1744&#150;59 and could have been intended for silver or for porcelain. Another signed drawing shows two glasses on a silver dish decorated with vine leaves and grapes (Society of Antiquaries, London). Sprimont was also a skilled modeller but, except in the earliest years, it is unlikely that he had time to design and model for the Chelsea manufactory himself as well as manage the enterprise. He directed the design and modelling by recruiting the best foreign craftsmen, including the Brussels-born figure modeller Joseph Willems, who eventually left for Tournai in 1766 after working for Chelsea for over fifteen years. The decorating studio was managed by a member of the Flemish Duvivier family. In the 1760s the modeller responsible for the French-style vases may have been Flanchet, described by a contemporary as a pupil of the French court goldsmith Jean Claude Duplessis. There was a workforce of about a hundred at Chelsea during the early 1750s.<br>
<br>Sprimont used his own skills to promote those of the next generation. He provided training in designing and painting&#151;&#145;arts very much wanted here&#146;&#151;for thirty boys from parish and charity schools  (Tait, 26&#150;7). One of these, William Browne, described his experiences in a letter of 1772 to the earl of Charlemont:<blockquote>I served an apprenticeship to Mr Sprimont of Chelsea who &hellip; was the first person who brought English china to the perfection it now has arrived at. Under him, I was made master of the various branches of this art, and though painting was my particular department in his manufactory, yet with attention I have obtained a thorough practical knowledge of the whole process. (ibid.)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>A painting of a man seated with two ladies, flanked by Chelsea porcelain vases, has recently been identified as showing Nicholas Sprimont with his wife and his sister-in-law Susanna Protin. It dates from about 1759 and features elaborate porcelain vases associated with the Chelsea gold anchor period (1758&#150;69), when the addition of bone ash made the paste better able to retain its shape during the firing process. One of these vases is closely based on a French model produced at the Vincennes factory by Duplessis. The lady carrying the pot-pourri vase&#151;identified as Sprimont's sister-in-law Susanna&#151;played an active part in the management of the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory. In 1751 her signature is found on the apprenticeship indenture of Richard Dyer; in August 1769 she was signatory of the transferral of the lease on the Chelsea factory to the new owner, the jeweller James Cox. Susanna lived with the Sprimonts for the last few years of Nicholas's life, and he recognized her support by leaving her &pound;1500 in his will. The identification of the sitter as Sprimont is reinforced by his evident ill health. Sprimont is thought to have suffered from chronic gout; his lameness is mentioned in a press notice in January 1763, as it impeded development of the manufactory.<br>
<br>Besides his own portrait Sprimont had a considerable collection of Italian, French, Flemish, and Dutch paintings, including works by Poussin and Watteau. These furnished his house in Chelsea and, from 1762, his property in Richmond, Surrey, on the terrace overlooking the bridge. In December 1758 he announced his intention to sell &#145;all his Pictures &hellip; in order to enable him to carry on his great Undertaking in the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory till March next&#146;  (Tait, 27). This sale was cancelled and the paintings were eventually sold at Christies in March 1771, when they raised &pound;1239. The spate of newspaper advertisements for the Chelsea manufactory that mention Sprimont's name demonstrate his ability to promote his venture.<br>
<br>In April 1769 a notice of sale of the Chelsea porcelain factory, including the models, mills, kilns, and presses, appeared in the London press. The finished porcelain was sold to a Piccadilly dealer, Thomas Morgan, who made a considerable profit, and James Cox, jeweller, bought all the workshops and equipment later that year. The death of Sprimont's manager, Francis Thomas, in January 1770 led Cox to sell the factory to William Duesbury and John Heath, of Derby, in the following month. The manufactory continued in their ownership until 1784, when the Lawrence Street buildings were demolished.<br>
<br>After Sprimont's death, on 22 June 1771, Susanna Protin married his friend the upholsterer Francis Deschamps; Sprimont was buried in the Deschamps family vault at Petersham church, near Richmond. Sprimont's wife, Ann, remarried in 1773. She described her first husband as &#145;a man of the most unsuspecting and benevolent disposition&#146;  (Gardner, 140). The couple had had no children. Collections of Sprimont's silver are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.<br>
