<span class="headword">Arnould, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1813&#150;1886), <span class="occ">judge in India and writer</span>, was born at Camberwell, Surrey, on 12 November 1813, the eldest son of Joseph Arnould MD (1786/7&#150;1859) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Baily. Joseph Arnould senior owned White Cross, near Wallingford in Berkshire, and was a deputy lieutenant for that county. On his death in June 1859 the property passed to his eldest son.<br>
<br>Arnould was educated at Charterhouse School (1826&#150;1828/9) and was admitted to Wadham College, Oxford, on 4 October 1831, so beginning a glittering academic career. He was Goodridge exhibitioner from 1833 to 1835, Hody (Greek) exhibitioner from 1833 to 1836, and in 1834 his &#145;Hospice of St Bernard&#146; won the Newdigate prize for English verse. On 10 June 1834 he recited it at the Sheldonian Theatre when the duke of Wellington was installed as chancellor of the university and in doing so he refashioned two lines so as to read that he whom &#145;&hellip; a world could not subdue / Bent to thy prowess, chief of Waterloo&#146;  (J. Pycroft, <span class="italic">Oxford Memories</span>, 2 vols., 1886, 2.4). This caused a sensation: John Wilson Croker reported that, on hearing the word Waterloo, the whole assembly started up and &#145;some people appeared to me to go out of their senses&#151;literally to go mad&#146;  (Croker, 2.228).<br>
<br>Arnould graduated BA on 13 May 1836, with first-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and was elected a probationer fellow of Wadham in June 1838 and moderator of philosophy in 1840. He ceased to be a fellow in January 1841, on his marriage to Maria (1818/19&#150;1859), eldest daughter of H. G. Ridgeway.<br>
<br>On 10 November 1836 Arnould was admitted to the Middle Temple, and, having been called to the bar on 19 November 1841, he practised as a special pleader and joined the home circuit. For a time he shared chambers with Alfred Domett (1811&#150;1887), the intimate friend of Robert Browning; the poet composed &#145;Waring&#146; in lamentation at Domett's emigration to New Zealand in 1842. Arnould himself wrote verse; published work included <span class="italic">Memorial Lines on Sir Robert Peel</span> (1850). Some of his poems touching on social questions were published in Douglas Jerrold's <span class="italic">Weekly Newspaper</span>, and he also wrote leaders for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. In 1848 he published a two-volume <span class="italic">Treatise on the Law of Marine Insurance and Average</span>. Its wide-ranging reference to American cases saw it republished in Boston in 1850, and in England it remains the standard work on marine insurance law, having appeared in a sixteenth edition in 1997.<br>
<br>In 1859 Arnould was appointed by Lord Stanley, secretary of state for India, a puisne judge of the supreme court of Bombay and was knighted on 2 February 1859. He took office on 28 April 1859 and retained his position when, in 1862, the supreme court was converted into the high court. Soon after their arrival in Bombay, on 23 July 1859, Arnould's wife Maria died of fever and dysentery. On 28 May 1860 Arnould married his second wife, Ann (Annie) Pitcairn (<i>b</i>. 1839), daughter of the late Major John William Carnegie CB of the 15th Bengal native infantry, and they had at least two children: Marie (<i>b</i>. 1861) and Ethel (<i>b</i>. 1862). None of his new family appears to have died in India, nevertheless an air of loss hung about him, perhaps from the tragic death of his first wife. A contemporary recalled that Arnould had suffered a &#145;domestic misfortune&#146; in Bombay, after which he &#145;shunned all society&#146;  (Wacha, 253).<br>
<br>As a judge, Arnould was valued for the breadth of his scholarship, his literariness, and an openness to social reform. A Parsi lawyer who was frequently before him, recalled him looking &#145;every inch &hellip; a judge&#146;&#151;&#145;a stout-looking gentleman, with an aldermanic paunch, a beaming and beneficient countenance&#146;  (Wacha, 252). In spite of his undoubted legal and personal success in Bombay, however, Arnould turned down the opportunity to become chief justice when Sir Matthew Sausse retired in 1866. He himself retired in 1869, whereupon leading Indian inhabitants of the city founded the Arnould scholarship at Bombay University in commemoration of his efforts to promote the study of Islamic and Hindu law.<br>
<br>In retirement, Arnould settled in Italy, residing at Naples from 1872 until 1880. In 1873 he published, in two volumes, a <span class="italic">Memoir of Thomas, First Lord Denman</span>, and in 1876 two continuation volumes to the first four volumes of Baron Campbell's <span class="italic">Lives of the Chief Justices of England</span>. He died at the Hotel Montebello, via Courtatone, Florence, on 16 February 1886; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
