<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Douglas,  Archibald</span>, sixth earl of Angus  (<em>c.</em>1489&#150;1557), <span class="occ">magnate and lord chancellor of Scotland</span>, was the eldest son of George Douglas, master of Angus (<i>c</i>.1469&#150;1513), and his wife, Elizabeth, widow of Sir David Fleming of Monycabo and daughter of John Drummond, first Lord Drummond.<h2>
<a name="Inheritanceandfirstbidsforpower"></a>Inheritance and first bids for power</h2>Douglas's first involvement in dynastic politics may have been his marriage in 1509 (contract 26 June) to Margaret, daughter of Patrick Hepburn, first earl of Bothwell, a rival of his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7864/', "Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus, nicknamed &#145;Bell-the-Cat&#146;")</script>. She died childless in 1514. His father was killed at Flodden on 9 September 1513, and in November Douglas succeeded to the earldom of Angus on the death of his grandfather. His inheritance was scattered over a wide area: Crawford Douglas in Lanarkshire, Tantallon in Haddingtonshire, the regalities of Jedburgh Forest and Selkirk, and the advowson of Abernethy collegiate church in Perthshire, to mention only a few. He maintained a persistent claim to Coldingham Priory, Berwickshire, important both for its potential wealth and for its position near the border, though here he faced competition from the Humes. He was also well connected: the Cunningham earls of Glencairn, the Graham earls of Montrose, the Hays of Yester, and the Lyons of Glamis were all close relatives. His considerable power and worth to the monarchy lay in his extensive kin and in the large number of armed retainers he could call upon for support.<br>
<br>In 1514 Angus began to attend the council regularly. In August 1514 (probably, though not certainly, on the 6th) he made a secret marriage at Kinnoull in Perthshire to James IV's widow, Margaret Tudor [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18052/', "Margaret (1489&#150;1541)")</script>]. The priest who performed the ceremony was Angus's kinsman John Drummond, and it is likely that the groom's maternal grandfather helped to arrange the match. This was barely eleven months after the king had been killed at Flodden and only four months after the birth of James's last child, Alexander. At that time Margaret was not only queen dowager, the mother and protector of the royal children, but also regent of the kingdom of Scotland. She also was a major landowner, holding not only her dower of Stirling Castle, but estates as widely scattered as Dunbar, Methven, and Crawford. In one bound, the youthful Angus leapt close to real power.<br>
<br>Angus's ambition was so blatant that Margaret was removed from the regency in September. The lords of the council then invited John Stewart, second duke of Albany, eldest son of James III's brother and the heir to the throne should the infant sons of James IV both die, to come from France and assume the governorship. Albany arrived in May 1515, a development which displeased Margaret's brother Henry VIII, who had counted on her to create and maintain good Anglo-Scottish relations and to keep him informed of Scottish affairs. Albany, by contrast, was seen as essentially an agent of France. So unpopular was her new union that Margaret fled to England, where in October she gave birth at Harbottle, Northumberland, to a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7911/', "Margaret Douglas")</script>. Angus and his wife had no more children; Angus lost interest in Margaret during her absence and took a mistress, Lady Jane Stewart of Traquair (to whom he had earlier been briefly betrothed). The queen responded by beginning divorce proceedings shortly afterwards, a goal which she attained only early in 1527. Yet despite their acrimony she begged James V to be &#145;good and gracious&#146; to her former husband as she died at Methven, Perthshire, the home of her third husband, Henry Stewart, Lord Methven, in October 1541.<br>
<br>Angus's influence in Scotland was restricted while Albany was in Scotland, but soon after the duke returned to France in June 1517 his arrangements for the government of Scotland began to break down. There was fierce competition for power between Angus and James Hamilton, earl of Arran, with control of Edinburgh in particular a bone of contention. Their rivalry culminated in the skirmish known as Cleanse the Causeway at the end of April 1520, in which the Hamiltons were driven from the town. But Albany returned late in 1521 and used his authority to restore order; thereupon Angus retired to France, where he stayed until 1524. It was Albany's leaving Scotland for France at the end of May in that year which enabled Angus to make the same crossing but in the opposite direction. He did not go directly, however, but made the journey via England&#151;he arrived in London on 28 June. He had been maintained by an English pension of 1000 marks since 1521, and in 1525 this was raised to &pound;1000. This reflected his importance in Scottish government by that date. In July 1524 Queen Margaret and her supporters had declared James V of age in order to ensure against Albany's return; as James was still only twelve they intended to govern in his name. Margaret was very anxious to prevent her estranged husband's return, but by October Angus had secured English agreement to his going home. He was perceived as popular in Scotland, and as a valuable counterbalance to the influence there of France. About the beginning of November he crossed the border.<h2>
<a name="Theexerciseofpower"></a>The exercise of power</h2>For several months Angus and Margaret competed for power. Margaret's coup of the previous July had led to the dismissal of Chancellor James Beaton, who now made common cause with the earl. Hence the proclamation issued in the king's name in January 1525 against consorting with Beaton, who had &#145;kept up private councils and trysts&#146; with Angus &#145;and other broken men&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/1, no. 1030). But Angus soon held the initiative, and by mid-February had enough noble support to be able to force the queen to surrender control of the realm to a council, in which he rapidly became predominant. As the queen dowager's husband, Angus held a &#145;special position&#146; within the realm. He was never formally designated regent to James V, whose person was instead entrusted on 17 July 1525 to a rota of four groups of lords, each of which was to be attendant on the boy as administrators of his realm for three months at a time. Angus was a member of the first group to have custody of James, but when the time came for the king to be passed to the second, at the beginning of November, he refused to surrender his charge.<br>
<br>Between 1525 and 1528 Angus had almost complete control over the person of the king, reinforcing his own position when he took the post of chancellor in August 1527. He also advanced the interests of his relations. His uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7882/', "Gavin Douglas")</script> was nominated to the see of Dunkeld; another uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7865/', "Sir Archibald Douglas")</script> of Kilspindie, became treasurer; his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7885/', "George Douglas")</script> of Pittendreich was master of the royal household; yet another brother, William, was given the revenues of Holyrood Abbey and Coldingham. His kinsman James Douglas of Drumlanrig had watch over the royal wine cellar. Some historians have seen Angus's administration as marking the low point of sixteenth-century Scottish political morality, but such a condemnation is anachronistic as well as exaggerated; it was expected that a nobleman would use power to further the interest of his kin. Moreover, Angus performed his duties in government, both those attached to his various offices and the broader responsibilities involved in trying to punish wrongdoing and disorder. These often overlapped with his efforts to keep peace with England. Between 1525 and 1528 he made no fewer than six judicial raids into the borders, more than any of his predecessors had done, and though their effects were usually transient, some observers (for instance the English ambassador Thomas Magnus) still felt able to declare that the region had never been better ruled. Angus's work here provided a model for later policy: thus James V's hounding of the Armstrongs in the early 1530s was a direct continuation of Angus's attempts to tame them in 1527&#150;8, when he was warden of the east and middle marches. Both in September 1525 and in January 1526 Angus was also a commissioner in negotiations for a lasting peace with England, and his efforts here, too, enjoyed at least a temporary success, with a treaty being concluded at Berwick on 15 January 1526.<br>
<br>Despite his achievements Angus faced growing opposition. The queen was unreconciled to her loss of power, and Angus also had to face the continuing hostility of the Hamiltons and of the Humes (over whom Angus exercised a technical overlordship), who resented his activities in border areas they regarded as their own preserve. In January 1526 Margaret and Arran led an attempted coup, but this was quickly suppressed. Then in August 1527, while Angus was engaged in a judicial raid into the borders with the king, Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch attempted to ambush them at Melrose in order to take control of the monarch; this attempt also failed. Appreciating the developing threat to his position, Angus manoeuvred to maintain a coalition of supporters, but John Stewart, twelfth earl of Lennox, a key figure in any grouping, had become irremediably alienated, partly by Angus's refusal to share the custody of the king and partly by the extent to which government patronage was now monopolized by the Douglases, and on 4 September 1526 he made his own bid to secure the person of James V. The &#145;Lennox affair&#146; which took place at Manuel near Linlithgow perhaps deserves to be called only a skirmish, but it resulted in Lennox's being killed, leaving Angus still very much in control of Scottish government.<h2>
<a name="Defeatandexile"></a>Defeat and exile</h2>From 1526 the problem of Angus's relations with his fellow Scottish nobles was increasingly overshadowed by those with his young king. His hold on power depended entirely on his hold on James, who was therefore effectively kept a prisoner, with his every move being closely watched, and as far as possible distracted from thoughts of power by being encouraged into debauchery. These dubious pleasures notwithstanding, James came to loathe the Douglases in general, and Angus in particular, with a fine and near hysterical fervour. Finally, at the end of May 1528, he escaped from Edinburgh and fled to Stirling, where in the following month he raised the country against Angus, who was replaced as chancellor by Gavin Dunbar, archbishop of Glasgow, while Lord Hume became warden of the east march. On 23 June James announced that a convention would be held in Edinburgh on 10 July, with the purpose of investigating charges of maladministration against Angus. He wrote to Henry VIII giving details of his former chancellor's deficiencies, and on 13 July had Angus summoned on a charge of treason. The summons was served on the earl at Dalkeith five days later, and he was finally forfeited on 5 September. Angus and his brother George withdrew to the great Douglas castle of Tantallon, where they were able to resist the Royal Artillery, mocking the ineffectiveness of both the king and his guns. But efforts to secure English support came to nothing, and when Magnus tried to intercede for Angus with King James he was rebuffed. Fighting continued throughout the winter, but the pressure which the king was able to exert on the Douglases began to tell, and on 23 March 1529 Angus agreed to surrender Tantallon and his other castles and retreat to England. The only concession he was able to extract was that his earldom would retain its integrity. Thus began a thirteen-year exile, during which James conducted a relentless hounding of members of the Douglas family, justified by his conviction that Angus and his brother wanted to return to Scotland and see the king dead.<br>
<br>Although he travelled intermittently to the English court, Angus resided mostly at Berwick upon Tweed, which served as a base for numerous raids into Scotland and where he gathered information for forwarding to Henry VIII. He was now totally dependent upon the English king's goodwill and on 25 August 1532 signed a contract (deemed a treaty in English records) recognizing Henry as supreme lord of Scotland, to whom he rendered homage. His knowledge of the borders exceeded that of many English march wardens, and his attacks upon Scotland were often bloodily effective. When James went to France in 1536 it was suggested that the French king be asked to try to reconcile him to Angus, but nothing came of this, and James's campaign of violence against the Douglases continued, culminating in the burning at the stake of Angus's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7906/', "Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis")</script>, in 1537. She had been charged with treason, for having both conspired to poison the king and communicated with her exiled brothers. Even this failed to satisfy the king's hostility and vindictiveness, for in December 1540 the Scottish parliament declared all Angus's estates forfeited and he was again branded a traitor. The earl's lands were now comprehensively redistributed by James.<br>
<br>During his thirteen years of exile Angus became a skilled and experienced soldier, as he showed again when war between England and Scotland erupted once more in the summer of 1542, leading a number of highly destructive raids over the border; John Dudley, Lord Lisle, praised his diligence. He was a member of the English army which the Scots roundly defeated at Haddon Rig on 24 August and was almost captured. It was rumoured after the Scottish defeat at the battle of Solway Moss on 24 November 1542 that James V was considering calling Angus home so that he could bring order to the Scottish armies and lead them effectively. The earl was one of the first to hear of James's death on 14 December, so efficient was his information-gathering network (as Lord Lisle observed).<h2>
<a name="ReturntoScotland"></a>Return to Scotland</h2>After the death of James V, James Hamilton, second earl of Arran, emerged as governor and immediately set about reversing almost all James's policies. The central plank of his programme was to return the Scottish aristocracy to the centre of politics, and he invited Angus to return home, which he did with his brother early in 1543. Before leaving England he signed a set of articles in which he promised to secure the person of the infant Queen Mary for Henry VIII, not to mention a string of powerful castles. On 16 January 1543 Arran issued a proclamation restoring Angus's estates, and in the March parliament his forfeiture was voided.<br>
<br>Angus was so attached to Henry that he became the effective head of an English party in Scotland, advocating protestantism and the marriage of Queen Mary to Prince Edward. It was to Angus that the English ambassador, Sir Ralph Sadler, repeatedly turned for information and advice, and when Sadler was hounded out of Edinburgh in September 1543, it was to Coldingham and Tantallon that he retired. During Arran's short-lived protestant phase (January to August 1543) Angus wielded considerable influence. On 9 April 1543 he married his third wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1594), daughter of Robert Maxwell, fifth Lord Maxwell. It might have been a useful political alliance had not Maxwell spent the years between January 1544 and his death in 1546 almost entirely in gaol, in Blackness Tower in Scotland and in the Tower of London. None of the children of Angus's marriage to Margaret survived to maturity.<br>
<br>When Arran returned to the Catholic faith in September and rejected the English marriage, Angus opposed him, increasingly by armed force. At this time Angus remained loyal to Henry as did others of his party, men like William Cunningham, third earl of Glencairn. In January 1544 Angus and his allies formed a small army and issued defiance to the governor at Leith, but Arran was too quick and too strong for him, and at Greenside Chapel Angus was forced to submit and give pledges: Maxwell was gaoled, as was George Douglas. Angus escaped to his estates and lay low, but in April 1544 was warded in Blackness. He was freed in May when Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, sacked Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Gradually Angus transferred his allegiance from Henry VIII to Arran's regime, and late in 1544 showed himself a true Scotsman. Arran had mustered a small army, strengthened by artillery from Edinburgh Castle, proposing to retake Coldingham Priory, which the English had fortified. But when he heard that an English army intended to attack him, he fled and his army almost disintegrated. Angus, however, kept his nerve. Though an adroit practitioner of mounted warfare characteristic of the border regions, he also appreciated the potentially decisive role that artillery could now play on the battlefield. At this juncture he made sure that the Scottish guns were not abandoned, storing them at Dunbar. This was the act of a man who knew (as Arran then did not) how to fight wars and who had a firm grip on military imperatives. Others appreciated his qualities, to the extent that in December 1544 he was appointed lieutenant-general of the south, given money to hire soldiers, and encouraged to attack England's Scottish allies&#151;his own former associates&#151;in Teviotdale and the Merse.<h2>
<a name="AncrumMoor"></a>Ancrum Moor</h2>Angus's martial qualities were still more strikingly displayed at his famous triumph at Ancrum Moor, fought on 27 February 1545. A massive English raiding party, over 5000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Evers and Brian Layton, had invaded the borders, setting fire to numerous tower houses and desecrating Melrose Abbey, where many Douglas tombs lay. At the time it was widely reported that Angus turned on his erstwhile allies in revenge for this sacrilege, but he had already abandoned his English alliance. Using his own and Arran's troops, Angus lured the English into a trap. Just before the battle at Ancrum Moor commenced, a heron flew over him, prompting him to remark: &#145;Would that I had my goose hawk [goshawk] with me now: I could thus have two good meals in one day.&#146;<br>
<br>The massive defeat which Angus inflicted on the English was in no small measure due to the revolt of the contingent of &#145;assured Scots&#146; in English service, something Angus may have engineered in advance. Over 1000 English were made prisoners and both their commanders were killed. Moved to tears, Arran embraced Angus, and trumpeted how the earl was now &#145;ane true Scottisman&#146; again. In the words of a seventeenth-century poet, &#145;the honour of the victory was wholly given to him&#146;  (Hume, ed. Reid, 2.121). Fran&ccedil;ois I of France was overjoyed at the victory, and a printed report (<span class="italic">La deffaicte des anglois par les ecossois faicte le jour de jeudi sainct dernier</span>) was published in Rouen and widely circulated. Fran&ccedil;ois then sent an expeditionary army to help the Scots during the summer of 1545. Its commander brought with him Angus's admission to the order of St Michel, an honour Angus deeply cherished. This was rehabilitation indeed, and yet more rewards followed, in particular the revenues of Arbroath Abbey, one of Scotland's richest monasteries. When a massive English army attacked Scotland in 1547, Angus again showed his military skills. At the battle of Pinkie, fought on 10 September, he commanded the Scottish right wing, and when the main battle under Arran and the left wing under George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly, began to disintegrate under the impact of sophisticated English firepower, Angus kept his head and suffered the fewest casualties. He also extricated himself (by hiding in a ditch), as Huntly did not.<h2>
<a name="Drumlanrig"></a>Drumlanrig</h2>Angus's skills as a soldier did not lie only in steadfastness; he also had a grasp of strategy which he displayed tellingly in the aftermath of Pinkie, which seemed to lay Scotland at the feet of the invader. In February 1548 a force under Thomas Wharton, first Baron Wharton, and Matthew Stewart, thirteenth earl of Lennox, invaded the west marches. Their intention was to attack James Douglas of Drumlanrig, one of the few Scots in the west not to have assured. Again, Angus laid a trap. One of the key elements in Wharton's force was some 1000 assured Scots under the command of John Maxwell, master of Maxwell, who had submitted to the English with great reluctance at the end of 1547. Maxwell clearly kept Arran informed of this attack and promised that he would &#145;revolt&#146; if the governor would only allow him to marry the crown's richest ward, Agnes Herries, Lady Herries, of Terregles. Arran agreed, whereupon Angus assembled a small army and despite the wintry conditions took it over the Lammermuir Hills and fell upon Wharton's force, defeating it piecemeal. Angus's triumph on this occasion was even more timely than his victory at Ancrum Moor, for England's &#145;pale&#146; in the south-west utterly collapsed. Utterly routed, Wharton withdrew via Dumfries to Carlisle, while his report to the English commander at Haddington (carried by his son, in a state of near hysteria) so alarmed the latter that he abandoned the town and removed the English garrisons at Yester and Hailes to Berwick. Angus's reputation soared.<br>
<br>With these victories under his belt Angus became unabashedly hostile to Edward Seymour, formerly earl of Hertford (and as such Angus's rescuer in 1544) but now duke of Somerset and lord protector, and to all his works. This loathing was fully reciprocated: the English made at least two determined attempts to capture Angus. The earl, increasingly assiduous in attending council and parliament meetings, now worked vigorously with Arran to have Queen Mary sent to France, for marriage to the dauphin. He played a conspicuous part in the parliament held at Haddington Abbey in July 1548, when he presented the Scottish regalia to the French commander, and commanded half of the Scottish force besieging the town near by. In September he was rewarded with another order of St Michel and a pension to enable him to finance a company of cavalry, while in November he helped to raise a force to push the English out of Dundee; December found him attacking their garrison at Broughty. The English garrisons stood increasingly on the defensive, and were unable to attack the Scots as Somerset had intended. The cost to the English exchequer became insupportable, and in September 1549 Haddington had to be abandoned; by the end of March 1550 Scotland was utterly lost to England. All this had stemmed largely from Angus's victory at Drumlanrig.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>Once the wars were over Angus set about trying to restore his estates and regalities. He had been regranted most of his forfeited lands by the lords of council in July 1546 and July 1547. Then at the parliament of February 1552 both he and his brother George were declared exempt from any claims brought against them as a result of their devastations in the borders around Berwick between 1529 and 1542. The rest of his life was spent not on the battlefield but in the law courts, as he set about recovering his former properties which James V had given away. As a result he largely left the central stage of high politics, attending only a few meetings of the privy council in June and August 1553, signing a bond in favour of Arran in February 1554, and standing caution the next year for Huntly. By the end of his life he had virtually reconstituted the inheritance he received in 1514. A further factor in his withdrawal from politics was the mutual dislike between him and Mary of Guise, who became regent of Scotland in April 1554. Attempts were made to tame him, to make him behave in a respectful and obedient manner. They all failed. Mary of Guise once rebuked him for turning up to a meeting in armour. Angus rejoined: &#145;It is only my old dad Lord Drummond's coat, a very kindly coat to me. I cannot part with it.&#146;<br>
<br>To the end of his life Angus retained a strong sense of family loyalty. When walking across the courtyard at Douglas one day in 1550, he encountered a messenger sent from his daughter Margaret, countess of Lennox, then in England. He paused to ask after the family's health and general well-being. And he gossiped that the French were coming to take over the kingdom, &#145;and frenche lawes and thei be sharpe&#146;. How was it with his grandson, Lord Darnley (&#145;that young boy there&#146;), whose residence so far away in England &#145;brekes my hart?&#146; Patience was a virtue he had clearly cultivated in his many years of exile. &#145;The worlde ys very strange and I have sene mony changes&#146;  (BL, MS Cotton Calig., fol. 423). The tales many recorded about him may well be apocryphal in their details, but they often accord with firsthand accounts of his deeds and sayings, as well as with his contemporary reputation.<br>
<br>Angus died at Tantallon shortly before 22 January 1557. As he lay dying, a retainer commented that it was ironic that such a formidable warrior should expire in his bedclothes and not have been killed in battle, underneath his heart standard. &#145;Lo,&#146; Angus barked, grasping a crucifix, &#145;Here is the standard under which I shall die&#146;  (Merriman, 353). He was buried in the collegiate church of Abernethy, Perthshire, of which he was patron.<br>
<br>Despite many frustrations, especially in the years of his exile, Angus showed some accomplishment in the exercise of power, both in the mid-1520s and later. Moreover he was a soldier of notable skill in an age which knew many such. But he failed in a dynast's most important duty, leaving no male heir to succeed to his inheritance. His daughter Margaret, countess of Lennox, had put pressure on him to deed the honour and lands of Angus to her and her heirs, but instead he created an entail which laid down that all should go only to heirs male. The earldom thus passed to Angus's nephew, David Douglas, who lived only until June 1557, after which his great-nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7868/', "Archibald Douglas (c.1555&#150;1588)")</script> succeeded as eighth earl of Angus.<br>
