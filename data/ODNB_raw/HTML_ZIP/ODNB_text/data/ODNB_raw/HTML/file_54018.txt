<span class="headword">Roberts,  John</span>  (1880&#150;1959), <span class="occ">historian and minister of the Presbyterian Church of Wales</span>, was born in Porthmadog, Caernarvonshire, on 16 October 1880, the son of the Revd John John Roberts (1840&#150;1914), better known by his bardic name of Iolo Caernarfon, and his wife, Ann Williams (1846&#150;1910) of Castellgoed in Eifionydd. Roberts was educated at a local school and, from 1891, at the county school in Bala, which had a remarkable headmaster, John Cadwaladr Evans, a Latin scholar. He found himself among a group of talented schoolchildren, all studying the classics, including John Edward Hughes (1879&#150;1959), later of Brynsiencyn, and Robert Thomas Jenkins (1881&#150;1969), who became a lifelong friend. From Bala he entered Jesus College, Oxford, where he graduated in the classics and then read theology. In 1903 he married Annie Jones Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1959) of Porthmadog, and they had four sons and two daughters. Their son John became an international rugby player for Wales.<br>
<br>Ordained in 1905, John Roberts served as a minister in Aberdyfi before moving in 1906 to David Street Welsh Presbyterian Chapel in the Dingle area of Liverpool, where he remained for seven years. In 1913 he received a call to the Presbyterian chapel in Pembroke Terrace, Cardiff, as a successor to a versatile minister, Revd Dr John Morgan Jones. In the inter-war years John Roberts became a natural leader for Welsh Presbyterians in his presbytery, which included not only Cardiff but also the depressed areas of the Rhondda, Aberd&acirc;r, Merthyr and Rhymni. Most of the valley chapels in south Wales had a minister, but found it increasingly difficult to fulfil the financial commitments. The connectional debt in 1935 was over &pound;400,000, and of that sum the debt of the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire presbyteries was &pound;271,489, 60 per cent of the whole. Roberts persuaded the associations in north and south Wales, as well as east Glamorgan Welsh Presbytery, to raise at least &pound;15,000 each. He then travelled to other presbyteries to plead for more assistance; in 1938 he resigned from his pastorate to become the full-time secretary of the Sustentation Fund for South Wales, and in 1948 he became secretary of the newly amalgamated Sustentation Fund for the whole denomination. The end result was to place ministers and their families on a more secure financial footing, with each individual chapel paying according to its membership every quarter to the office in Cardiff, while ministers were paid a minimum monthly salary and a pension on retirement. Roberts thus has the distinction of being the architect of modern Welsh Presbyterianism.<br>
<br>Within the denomination Roberts became a highly respected leader, elected moderator of the general assembly in 1943 and in 1947 moderator of the south Wales association. He was constantly invited to appear at preaching festivals and was regarded as an authority on the history of Welsh preaching. His study of the history of the connection bore fruit in the prestigious Davies lecture of 1930, which was subsequently enlarged and published in Welsh in 1931 under the title <span class="italic">Methodistiaeth Calfinaidd Cymru</span> (&#145;Welsh Calvinistic Methodism&#146;), with an English-language edition appearing in 1934. These volumes were highly acclaimed by professional historians when they appeared and they have since become classics.<br>
<br>Roberts took an active part in the life of Wales, and led a deputation to London in 1932 on behalf of the depressed valleys, to plead their cause before the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin. A committed supporter of the Labour Party, Roberts succeeded David Lloyd George as chairman of the consultative council on religious broadcasting within the BBC. The University of Wales awarded him an honorary doctorate of divinity in 1954, and his denomination organized a testimonial for him, though he never actually retired. He died in St David's Hospital, Cardiff, on 29 July 1959, and his ashes were scattered in the garden of Thornhill crematorium on the outskirts of Cardiff. After his death the administrative offices in Richmond Road, Cardiff, where he had worked, were renamed T&#375; John Roberts.<br>
