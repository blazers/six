<span class="headword">Stanfield,  James Field</span>  (1749&#150;1824), <span class="occ">actor and author</span>, was born in 1749 in Dublin, according to family report. He was educated in France for the Roman Catholic priesthood but instead became a seaman, and claimed to have voyaged to most parts of Europe and North America. In September 1774, as a common mariner, he sailed from Liverpool in the snow <i>Eagle</i> under Captain David Wilson, on a slaving voyage to Benin. Arriving by early November the <i>Eagle</i> was turned into a coastal depot, and Stanfield was sent up the Formosa or Benin River to work at an inland factory at Gwato, near Benin City, possibly as a clerk given his education. He spent about eight months there before rejoining Wilson in a new ship, the <i>True Blue</i>, which sailed for the Caribbean in September 1775. Of the 213 slaves carried on a notably brutal &#145;middle passage&#146; 23 died; by contrast only 15 of the 25 European crew who left Africa survived to reach Jamaica early in January 1776. Stanfield returned to Liverpool in the <i>True Blue</i>, arriving in April and remaining there some time as one of only four who returned from the round voyage in both ships. It may have been his last voyage, but notes by the Newcastle antiquary John Bell assert that he was detained in the American war and, if true, this could only have been subsequently. Against it stands the fact that in February 1777 a Mr and Mrs Stanfield appeared on stage at Manchester, a venue at which (with Bristol) Stanfield claimed to have performed, though supporting evidence is lacking, including of such a marriage. Stanfield was in London, occupation unknown, for a period in mid-1781, and appeared on stage at Lichfield that December and at Bath from September 1782 to July 1783. On 25 October 1785 he was married at Cheltenham to Mary Hoad of that town, and from October 1786 to December 1812 was on the northern stage, including the York, Scarborough, and Harrogate circuits. He was joint manager of a band of strollers there and in the borders between 1799 and 1808. From April 1814 he taught elocution and composition in Edinburgh. He played his last-known stage parts early in 1817 at the Glasgow theatre and was still there in 1819&#150;20 as prompter, but some time thereafter he joined his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26234/', "Clarkson Stanfield")</script> in London.<br>
<br>From 1793 to 1796 Stanfield ceased acting and settled as a &#145;brandy merchant&#146; in Sunderland, where he was a principal founder of the subscription library in 1795. His slaving experience having allied him with the abolitionists, he wrote graphically against the trade in his <span class="italic">Observations on a Guinea Voyage, in a Series of Letters Addressed to the Revd Thomas Clarkson</span>, published in 1788. His dramatic poem <span class="italic">The Guinea Voyage</span>, in the style of Falconer's <span class="italic">Shipwreck</span>, appeared in 1789. Stanfield later had both reprinted in one volume at Edinburgh in 1807, the year of abolition. Overall his account's particular importance is as the first condemning the slave trade as a grave of European seamen, though also testifying to its other horrors and the potentials for more worthy commerce with the African society he had seen. He also wrote two shorter abolitionist poems: lines &#145;Written on the Coast of Africa in the year 1776 [<i>sic</i>]&#146; were only published in 1795, while an &#145;elegy&#146; of 1796 commemorated Captain Matthew Winterbotham of the Sierra Leone Company, who drowned at Dix Cove, Senegal, after a 300 mile inland investigation of alternative commerce to &#145;the detestable slave trade&#146;. Stanfield was himself called before one of the parliamentary inquiries on slavery, probably in 1790, but no firm evidence of his appearance has emerged. In 1790 W. Thompson of Newcastle published anonymously his <span class="italic">Life of the Late John Howard</span>, a biography of the prison reformer, and in 1795 he began an <span class="italic">Essay on the Study and Composition of Biography</span>, published by subscription at Sunderland in 1813. Moralistically erudite but also reviewed (by John Foster, <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>, February 1814) as confused and &#145;ineffective, in a very strange degree&#146;, it was founded on his zeal for the philosophy of Francis Bacon, which his command of Latin allowed him to read in the original. More recently it has been credited as &#145;the first full-length book on the theory of biography in English&#146;, lacking originality but at least providing &#145;a coherent synopsis of literary opinions&#146; on the topic at that time  (Nisbet and Rawson, 303). He wrote an unpublished two-act comic opera, <span class="italic">The Fishermen</span>, in 1786, and was an author of songs and other verse. Much of this was masonic, Stanfield being a prominent Sunderland freemason, and sixteen pieces, including the two short slavery poems, appeared in the <span class="italic">Freemasons' Magazine</span> between 1793 and 1798. He was also a noted performer of his own comic Irish songs. Of these, &#145;The Wedding of Ballyporeen&#146; and &#145;Patrick O'Neal&#146; (celebrating the naval battle of 1 June 1794) were the best known.<br>
<br>Stanfield's talents were admired by learned friends, including the biographer G. W. Meadley and the moral philosopher Dugald Stewart, and he remained lively and undaunted despite chronic financial hardship. As an actor he played character parts, and Tate Wilkinson, the York theatre patentee, testified to his rapid memory, spirited intelligence, and unhandsome appearance; an engraved portrait after Clarkson Stanfield is in the British Museum. Stanfield's wife, Mary Hoad, died on 11 January 1801 at Morpeth; Maria Field Kell, whom he married on 29 October of that year, died in Edinburgh on 17 September 1816; both were actresses and with both he had numerous family. Of these, Mary, an actress in Edinburgh, and Clarkson were children of the first. A daughter of the second, Maria (1802&#150;1858), was also an actress in Glasgow and elsewhere before marrying a lawyer, John Blackburn, at Liverpool in 1831. Stanfield died in his lodgings in Wootten Street, Lambeth, on 9 May 1824, aged seventy-four, and was buried at St Mary's, Lambeth, six days later.<br>
