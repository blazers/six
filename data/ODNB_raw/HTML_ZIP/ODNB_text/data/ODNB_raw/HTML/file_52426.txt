<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mendelssohn Bartholdy,  (Jacob Ludwig) Felix</span>  (1809&#150;1847), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 3 February 1809 at Hamburg, Germany, the second of four children of the Jewish banker Abraham Mendelssohn (1776&#150;1835) and his wife, Lea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Salomon (1777&#150;1842). In 1811 the family moved to Berlin, where the precocious musical gifts of Felix and his elder sister Fanny (1805&#150;1847) soon became evident. The children were baptized as protestants in 1816, and Bartholdy was added to the family name, although it was not used until 1822, when the parents also converted.<h2>
<a name="MendelssohnsearlycontactswithBritain"></a>Mendelssohn's early contacts with Britain</h2>Mendelssohn's association with Britain began in 1829, by which time his reputation as a composer was already securely established, with an output which included the masterpieces of the octet (1825) and the overture to <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1826), the latter inspired by recent acquaintance with Shakespeare's works through the German translation of A. W. Schlegel. Following his famous revival of Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span> with the Singakademie in Berlin in March 1829, he embarked upon the first stage of a three-year grand tour to complete his education, and arrived in England on 21 April. A rudimentary knowledge of the English language was soon transformed into complete fluency, both spoken and written. In London he renewed acquaintance with three German friends, Karl Klingemann, secretary at the Hanoverian chancery, the composer and pianist Ignaz Moscheles, and the orientalist Friedrich Rosen. Through Moscheles he gave his first concert with the Philharmonic Society, on 25 May, when he conducted his symphony no. 1 in C minor, replacing the original minuet movement with an orchestrated version of the scherzo of the octet. The symphony was subsequently published with a dedication to the society, to whom Mendelssohn also presented the autograph score; in return he was made an honorary member on 29 November 1829. The association with the Philharmonic Society, where he was always enthusiastically received, was to become the principal reason for many of his later visits to the country. Conducting with a white baton, still a novelty at the time, he was to produce a wholly beneficial impact on orchestral discipline in the capital.<br>
<br>Mendelssohn was f&ecirc;ted by London musicians and society; lasting friendships were formed with families such as the Alexanders, the Attwoods, and the Horsleys, and the congenial musical, political, and social atmosphere of England was to prove a lifelong attraction. Time was also found to study the Handel autograph scores in the Royal Music Library, and to play the organ at St Paul's Cathedral. Performances on the organ, often to large audiences, were to become a regular feature of his English visits, and his playing of Bach and improvisation in particular brought wide admiration from fellow musicians, and exerted an important influence in a country where the provision and use of a pedal division on the instrument was still in its infancy. In July 1829, following the end of the London season, he embarked upon a tour of Scotland with Klingemann, which took them via York and Durham to Edinburgh, and then, after a brief inconsequential meeting with Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford&#151;the Mendelssohn family were devotees of his novels&#151;on up to Stirling, Perth, and Blair Atholl before crossing to Crianlarich, Glencoe, and Fort William, from where they took a steamer to Oban. At Tobermory on Mull on 7 August came the first inspiration for <span class="italic">The Hebrides</span> or &#145;Fingal's Cave&#146; overture, while they visited Staffa and the cave itself the following day, when Mendelssohn suffered badly from seasickness. After returning south by way of Inveraray and Glasgow to Liverpool, Mendelssohn continued alone into Wales as far as the Menai Strait, and then stayed for a week with the family of John Taylor at Coed-du near Holywell. Back in London in early September, he suffered a severe knee injury on falling from a carriage, which delayed his departure for Berlin until the end of November.<h2>
<a name="FurthervisitstoBritain"></a>Further visits to Britain</h2>At the end of his two-year stay in Italy, Switzerland, and France, Mendelssohn was in England again from April to June 1832, and <span class="italic">The Hebrides</span> overture received its first performance at the Philharmonic Society on 14 May, as did the <span class="italic">Capriccio Brilliant</span> for piano and orchestra, played by the composer at a concert of Nicholas Mori's on 25 May. Back in Berlin, Mendelssohn received a commission worth 100 guineas from the society in November 1832 for three new works, &#145;a symphony, an overture and a vocal piece&#146;  (Foster, 111). The &#145;Italian&#146; symphony in A major (in progress since the winter of 1830&#150;31), and the &#145;Trumpet&#146; overture (a revision of an 1826 work) were ready for the following year, when Mendelssohn paid two visits to London (April&#150;May and June&#150;August), separated by a journey to D&uuml;sseldorf for the lower Rhine music festival, from which he returned accompanied by his ageing father. The third part of the commission, the first version of the scena <span class="italic">Infelice</span>, was completed only later in the year, and received its premi&egrave;re in Mendelssohn's absence in 1834. In addition, several of the composer's other works owed their origins to English performers or music publishers, of which Novello, Mori and Lavenu, Ewer, and Coventry and Hollier were the principal ones. The works included the Morning and Evening Service, the motet &#145;Hear my prayer&#146;, the Ossianic scena <span class="italic">On Lena's Gloomy Heath</span>, and the six organ sonatas.<br>
<br>The demands of his posts as music director in D&uuml;sseldorf (1833&#150;5) and conductor of the Gewandhaus orchestra in Leipzig (from 1835) delayed another English visit until 1837, the year in which he married (on 28 March) C&eacute;cile Sophie Charlotte Jeanrenaud (1817&#150;1853). He had accepted an invitation to conduct his oratorio <span class="italic">St Paul</span> at the Birmingham music festival, and, reluctantly leaving his new bride (expecting the first of their five children), he travelled to London at the end of August before proceeding to Birmingham in September, where besides <span class="italic">St Paul</span> he also gave the premi&egrave;re of his second piano concerto and played the large organ of the new town hall. In the same year the music publisher Chappell commissioned an opera to a specially written libretto by J. R. Planch&eacute; on the theme of the siege of Calais, but Mendelssohn's initial enthusiasm, as so often with his adult operatic ventures, waned and it came to nothing. The Birmingham festival was also the reason for his next brief visit in September 1840, when he conducted the first British performances of the <span class="italic">Lobgesang</span> (&#145;Hymn of Praise&#146;) and his setting of <span class="roman">Psalm 114</span>.<br>
<br>Mendelssohn returned to England in June and July 1842, accompanied for the first and only time by his wife. On this occasion the main event was the British premi&egrave;re on 13 June of the newly completed A minor symphony (&#145;Scottish&#146;), the initial inspiration for which had occurred in the chapel of Holyrood Palace back in 1829. This visit also saw his first audiences with Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Buckingham Palace, when he obtained permission to dedicate the symphony to the queen, one of his great admirers. An excursion was also made to see C&eacute;cile's relatives in Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1844, increasingly frustrated by the musical situation in Berlin, where he had been Kapellmeister to the king of Prussia since 1841, Mendelssohn readily accepted another invitation from the Philharmonic Society, and arrived in May to conduct the last five concerts of the season. London heard the incidental music to <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, and <span class="italic">Die erste Walpurgisnacht</span> for the first time, and on 27 May Mendelssohn conducted Beethoven's violin concerto with his prot&eacute;g&eacute; the twelve-year-old Joseph Joachim as soloist. In addition he was involved at this time with the Handel Society, for whom he edited <span class="italic">Israel in Egypt</span> (published in 1845). Mendelssohn's intense musical and social activities during this trip also included conducting two performances of <span class="italic">St Paul</span> for the Sacred Harmonic Society, a meeting with Dickens, and a further visit to Manchester before finally leaving London on 10 July.<h2>
<a name="ThefirstperformancesofElijah18461847"></a>The first performances of Elijah, 1846&#150;1847</h2>In June 1845 the Birmingham music festival committee issued an invitation for Mendelssohn to act as chief conductor of the 1846 festival, together with a request for &#145;a new oratorio, or other music for the occasion&#146;  (Edwards, 29). Mendelssohn, already at work on <span class="italic">Elijah</span>, offered them its premi&egrave;re, but declined to conduct the whole festival. In the event the oratorio was only just ready in time, thanks to the prompting of the translator William Bartholomew and his English publisher, Edward Buxton of Ewer &amp; Co. Mendelssohn arrived in England a week before the performance on 26 August, which was greeted with enormous acclaim. After returning to London he went to Ramsgate for four days with his Benecke cousins, and crossed the channel again on 6 September. Despite the favourable reception of <span class="italic">Elijah</span>, Mendelssohn, as so often with his works, decided it needed revision before publication, and this he undertook over the following winter. During this time he was also in negotiation with Benjamin Lumley of Her Majesty's Theatre over an opera based on <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> with a libretto by A. E. Scribe, but once again Mendelssohn found the text unsatisfactory. He returned to England for the tenth and last time in April 1847 and conducted four London performances of the revised <span class="italic">Elijah</span> for the Sacred Harmonic Society, the second of which (23 April) was attended by the queen and Prince Albert, as well as single performances in Manchester (20 April) and Birmingham (27 April). After further concerts and visits to Buckingham Palace he returned to Frankfurt in the middle of May in an exhausted condition. The news of the sudden death of his sister Fanny on 14 May further weakened his health, which even a period of recuperation in Switzerland over the summer did not fully restore. Further requests for new compositions continued to come from England that year&#151;the Philharmonic Society wanted a symphony, and Liverpool a piece for the opening of the Philharmonic Hall&#151;but back in Leipzig a series of strokes in October led to Mendelssohn's death on 4 November 1847 at K&ouml;nigstrasse 3. He was buried in Dreif&auml;ltigkeitskirche cemetery, Berlin, on 8 November.<h2>
<a name="MendelssohnsinfluenceinBritain"></a>Mendelssohn's influence in Britain</h2>To honour his memory, fund-raising for a Mendelssohn scholarship was instituted in London in 1848, and the first scholar, Arthur Sullivan, was elected in 1856. Enthusiasm for his music in Britain, always warm in his lifetime and furnished with the seal of royal approval, reached its apogee in the decade following his death. Of his pupils, William Sterndale Bennett was to prove the most outstanding, possessing enough individuality to avoid wholesale subservience to his master's style. Mendelssohn's influence on other English composers, although it inevitably produced second-rate imitators, particularly in the field of oratorio and piano music, was not as dominant as sometimes claimed, being only one of many influences (including Mozart and Spohr) discernible in the more conservative aspects of mid-Victorian musical style. Mendelssohn's own two oratorios breathed new life into the Handelian inheritance, and, together with the <span class="italic">Lobgesang</span>, became part of the staple fare of the burgeoning amateur choral movement in the second half of the nineteenth century. This, and the enduring appeal of the <span class="italic">Songs without Words</span> to the vast army of Victorian pianists, led, however, by the end of the century to a derogatory view of the composer in certain circles as a panderer to bourgeois tastes&#151;most famously articulated by Bernard Shaw when he mocked &#145;his kid-glove gentility, his conventional sentimentality, and his despicable oratorio mongering&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Star</span>, 23 Feb 1889). A considerably more appreciative assessment of Mendelssohn's many-sided genius has begun to prevail in recent times.<br>
