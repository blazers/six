<span class="headword">Stampe,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>1610/11, <em>d.</em> in or after 1654), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a younger son of Timothy Stampe (<i>d</i>. 1615) of Bruern Abbey, near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Mary. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 20 April 1627, aged sixteen, graduating BA on 19 January 1631 and proceeding MA on 24 October 1633. He was presented to the living of St Aldate's, London, in 1637. He was incorporated MA at Cambridge University in 1640. By 1641 he was a schoolmaster in the parish of St Dunstan's, Stepney, and shortly after marrying Clemence Berry of Limehouse there on 26 May 1641 he was presented to the parish living, on 31 August 1641.<br>
<br>As civil war approached Stampe emerged as an outspoken supporter of the royalist cause. He delivered a sermon in June 1642 describing those raising money for parliament as the &#145;malignant party&#146; of sectarians and Anabaptists who were the causes of the country's distractions  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 62, fol. 211<i>v</i>). On 25 July 1642 he was summoned by parliament as a delinquent, having enlisted the help of his elder brother Timothy, a local JP, to imprison some apprentices who had gathered in the parish to enlist as troops for the earl of Essex's army. William called the apprentices &#145;Round-headed Rascals&#146; and manhandled some of those present  (<span class="italic">Perfect Diurnall</span>, 2). A new charge followed a few days later, when the brothers were accused of having incited a mob of sailors to burst into church and disturb a fast-day sermon. He was committed to the Gatehouse prison for thirty-four weeks, and was twice refused bail despite support from Lord Grey of Ruthin, while the committee for scandalous ministers collected evidence. By 9 August it had been decided to impeach him as a &#145;principal actor&#146; among local royalists; the living was eventually sequestered in August 1645  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 62, fol. 211<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Stampe travelled to Oxford after his release and, having published a sermon preached before the king at Christ Church in April 1643, was created DD on 18 July. Popular for his &#145;edifying way of preaching&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.348), Stampe followed the court into exile, and by May 1649 was chaplain to both Charles II and his aunt Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia. He preached regularly at Charenton, near Paris, and later during the 1650s at The Hague, where he published <span class="italic">A Treatise of Spiritual Infatuation</span> (by which he meant the folly of spiritual pride which had led to the religious disorders of the 1640s and which he saw as the disease of the English nation). The work was dedicated to his patron, Thomas Wentworth, earl of Cleveland, and was prefaced with a letter to the members of Trinity House in Ratcliff in particular and to his other Stepney parishioners in general, exhorting them to return to their loyalty to king and church. Although reputed to have died of fever at The Hague in 1653, and to have been buried at Loosduinen, he was probably still alive in April 1654, when Clarendon noted that, although he was considered honest, he was known for his &#145;vain and peevish humours&#146;  (Ogle and others, 2.336).<br>
