<span class="headword">Norris,  Henry</span>, first Baron Norris  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1601), <span class="occ">courtier and diplomat</span>, was the only son and second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20271/', "Henry Norris (b. before 1500, d. 1536)")</script> and Mary (<i>d</i>. in or before 1530), daughter of Thomas Fiennes, eighth Baron Dacre. His father was a gentleman of the privy chamber, groom of the stool and keeper of the privy purse, who in May 1536 was accused of adultery with Anne Boleyn and executed for treason. Before Anne's fall, Norris had been tutored in her household by Nicholas Bourbon, a French evangelical reformer. Thereafter he apparently remained at court as a ward of the king. The act of parliament condemning his father had allowed him to supplicate Henry VIII for the restoration of the family estates. Accordingly, in 1539 all his lands were returned except those which had been forfeited to the crown or were part of his maternal grandmother's estate. In 1544 he was granted new holdings in Southampton, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire, including extensive lands of the former monastery in Reading.<br>
<br>Under Henry VIII, Norris held minor office at court. In 1544 he was described as the king's servant; he was an official of the royal stable, and may also have been an attendant of Prince Edward. In the next reign he was a gentleman of Edward VI's privy chamber and sat in the parliament of 1547 as MP for Berkshire. In 1553 he was one of the witnesses to Edward's letters patent assigning the throne to Lady Jane Grey.<br>
<br>By 1544 Norris had married Margery (Margaret) [<a name="cosubject_69748"></a><span class="headword">Margery Norris</span>, Lady Norris  (<em>d.</em> 1599)<span class="occ"></span>], the younger daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29514/', "Sir John Williams")</script> and Elizabeth Edmonds; Sir John was created Baron Williams of Thame in 1554. This family connection became very important to Norris during the reign of Mary I. A strong partisan of the new queen, Williams acted as the protector and patron of his son-in-law, who had been an adherent of Northumberland and was out of sympathy with Catholicism. In 1553 Norris withdrew from court and retired to Wytham in Berkshire, one of Williams's manors. In 1556 the queen jointly granted the two men monastic land around Little Marlow in Buckinghamshire. Also thanks to Williams, Norris and his wife came to know Princess Elizabeth. As one of the princess's two guardians during her period of house arrest at Woodstock, Williams entertained her more than once at his house at Rycote in Oxfordshire, almost certainly while the Norrises were present. In May 1554 she was royally entertained there when stopping overnight on her way from the Tower to Woodstock. There is some evidence that over the next year, occasional short visits to Williams's house provided some relief from her otherwise isolated existence at Woodstock. In July 1555, on her return to London, she again stopped at Rycote. The memory of these visits and Williams's kindness to her during her period of confinement possibly prompted Elizabeth's warm feelings towards the Norrises at the beginning of her reign.<br>
<br>Immediately on her accession, Elizabeth removed the restrictions on Norris's inheritance. He inherited further landholdings in Berkshire and Oxfordshire on the deaths of his father-in-law and of his uncle Sir John Norris; with Williams's decease in 1559 he and his wife took possession of the family's primary seat at Rycote, Oxfordshire; and in 1565 he secured Yattendon, his uncle's property in Berkshire. His influence in these two counties proceeded apace: from 1559 he was JP for Berkshire, and for Oxfordshire from at least 1562.<br>
<br>Between 1563 and 1565 the Norrises spent much time at court. Although Margery was not appointed to the privy chamber, she was an intimate of the queen with the nickname Crow because of her dark complexion. In 1560 she was the chief mourner at the funeral of Lady Amy Dudley, probably because of her rank in the county of Oxfordshire where the death occurred. In September 1562 Norris had his first diplomatic experience when he was sent as special envoy to Paris, apparently with instructions to protest at the persecution of the Huguenots. In November 1565 he participated in a tournament in the queen's presence on the occasion of the marriage of the earl of Warwick. In September 1566 he was knighted when the queen visited him at Rycote on her return to London from Oxford. It has been suggested that his elevation was a preliminary to his appointment soon afterwards as ambassador to France.<br>
<br>Norris arrived in France in January 1567, and lived with his family outside Paris in a house chosen for its suitability to receive visitors without observation. His messages home were full of rumours of international conspiracies as well as detailed description of the military manoeuvres of both sides in the second and third French civil wars. He took the lead in requesting the return of Calais in the spring of 1567 in accordance with the treaty of Cateau Cambr&eacute;sis&#151;a request that was quickly rebuffed by the French. Besides writing regularly to the queen, Cecil, and Leicester (through whose influence he had probably secured the position of ambassador), Norris's recipients included Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Pembroke, and Sir Walter Mildmay. One of his informants was Daniel Rogers, the son of the first Marian martyr. Norris was impressed with Rogers's lineage and learning, and appointed him tutor to his children as well as steward and secretary in his household. Another of his secretaries was Edmund Mather who came under suspicion of treason in 1571.<br>
<br>Norris found his stay in Paris difficult. Cecil criticized him for exceeding his allowances in the pursuit of low value intelligence. Elizabeth chided him for being &#145;somewhat too partial&#146; towards the prince of Cond&eacute;, especially in exaggerating his successes in the military conflicts  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1566&#150;8</i>, 401). The French royal family did not trust him because of his sympathy for the Huguenots and consequently his post was seized on several occasions, his servants were arrested, and attempts were made to search his house. Worn down by these indignities and wanting to return to England where he faced several legal suits, Norris requested a recall in the spring and summer of 1569, or at the very least the return of his wife and family, but he had to wait until December 1570 before Francis Walsingham arrived in France as his successor.<br>
<br>After his return home in March 1571, Norris sat as MP for Oxfordshire in the parliament which opened on 2 April 1571. There he spoke on the <span class="roman">Bill to Preserve the Queen's Safety</span> and served on various committees. In May 1572 he was called to the House of Lords as Baron Norris of Rycote. In February 1576 he petitioned parliament for his restoration in blood and honours, and an act was passed to this effect. In 1585 a statute went through parliament to settle a lengthy law suit with Lord and Lady Dacres.<br>
<br>After 1572 Norris carried out a few ceremonial duties for the queen and gave her advice on martial matters. In November 1581 he participated in the trial of Lord Vaux (for harbouring Edmund Campion), and in April 1589 was summoned to hear the trial of Philip, earl of Arundel. For the most part, however, Norris served Elizabeth at a local level. From 1578 he was the keeper of the armoury and porter of the outer gate of Windsor Castle. He probably became high steward of Abingdon on Leicester's death, though the evidence is not clear, and definitely succeeded the earl as high steward of Wallingford in 1588. In July 1588 he was appointed captain of the light horse in the queen's bodyguard. He acted as joint lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire and Berkshire between 1585 and 1599 (an office shared with first Sir Francis and then Sir William Knollys). In this post, he was responsible for home defence and for mustering men for service abroad during the Spanish war. Although Sir Robert Naunton suggested that Norris competed aggressively with the Knollys family for local influence, later historians believed the factional conflict had been exaggerated and point to evidence of co-operation between them over parliamentary patronage and the protection of puritans.<br>
<br>In 1586, while carrying out his duty as a leading magistrate, Norris was physically attacked by a group of students from Magdalen College, Oxford, after their peers had been imprisoned for poaching royal deer. In 1596 his house was targeted for attack by a group of Oxfordshire men planning a rising against enclosures. They had heard that the house was full of munitions and timed their action for St Hugh's day, when most of the local gentry would be in London to celebrate Elizabeth's accession day. The rising, however, proved abortive and Norris was made responsible for interrogating its leaders, one of whom was his own carpenter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66806/', "Bartholomew Steer")</script>.<br>
<br>From the 1570s onwards the Norrises' six sons fought as soldiers in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. Norris and his wife supported their exploits financially and politically. They sold some of their manors, mortgaged their lands to the queen, and ran into debt to help pay the costs of their sons' martial careers. Both petitioned Burghley on <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20276/', "John Norris's")</script> behalf, first when he was banished from court in 1587 over his quarrels with Leicester during the Netherlands campaign, and again in 1589 when he was in trouble for his part in the disastrous Portugal campaign. In the 1590s both wrote to Robert Cecil to request their sons' return from Ireland.<br>
<br>In September 1592 Norris took advantage of the queen's visit to Rycote to present his children in a favourable light. In a courtly pastime, Elizabeth was offered gifts, ostensibly from a messenger sent by four of Norris's five surviving sons who were then serving her abroad. Each gift was an expensive token designed to remind the queen of their individual military service. In addition, Elizabeth was presented with a jewelled daisy supposedly sent by Norris's daughter Catherine who was married to Sir Anthony Poulett, governor of Jersey. Norris's sons tried in their turn to promote their father but without success. In September 1585 John suggested him as governor of Flushing, and in October 1598 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20265/', "Edward Norris")</script> reminded Essex of his &#145;promise touching my aged father when any councillors shall be named&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 8.405). All but one of Norris's sons died in royal service abroad: the eldest, William, in Ireland in December 1579; Maximilian in Brittany, 1593; John in Ireland in September 1597; and two years later both Henry and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20285/', "Thomas Norris")</script> also died in Ireland. On the death of John, Elizabeth wrote Margery a personal letter of condolence addressed to &#145;Mine own Crow&#146;. When Henry and Thomas died within weeks of each other in the summer of 1599, she again tried to comfort Margery and immediately relieved Margery's only surviving son, Edward, of his post as governor of Ostend, sending him home to be with his parents. Grief-stricken, Margery died soon afterwards, in December 1599. On her death, a court of wards commission was set up to inquire into her property and Elizabeth wrote off &pound;2000 of debt to relieve Norris. He remained in good health until his death in June 1601. On 5 August he was buried in the chapel at Rycote, having been briefly interred at Englefield church, Berkshire. His heir was his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20269/', "Francis Norris")</script>, the son of William.<br>
