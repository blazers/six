<span class="headword">Clive <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wigley; <em>later </em>Meysey-Wigley]</span>,  Caroline</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Archer Clive; <em>pseud. </em>V.]</span>  (1801&#150;1873), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, born at Brompton, London, on 30 June 1801, was the second daughter of Edmund Wigley (1758&#150;1821)&#151;who later changed his surname to Meysey-Wigley&#151;barrister and, for a short time, MP, and his wife, Anna Maria Meysey (<i>d</i>. 1835), the daughter and heir of Charles Watkins Meysey. She was brought up at Shakenhurst in Worcestershire, the home which her mother had inherited. At the age of two she contracted a disease, possibly poliomyelitis, which left her permanently disabled. She was educated by governesses, and after the deaths of her brother Edmund and her mother she became a wealthy heir. On 10 November 1840 she married the Revd Archer Clive, rector of Solihull, near Birmingham, the second son of Edward Bolton Clive MP. She had been in love with him for nine years and had lived alone at Solihull for five years in order to be near him. They had two children: a son, Charles Meysey Bolton, and a daughter, Alice. In 1845, following the death of his father, Archer Clive inherited Whitfield, the family estate in Herefordshire, and in 1847 he took his family to live there.<br>
<br>Caroline Clive's first book, a slim volume of religious meditations entitled <span class="italic">Essays on the Human Intellect as Constructed by God &hellip;</span>, had been published in 1827 under the pseudonym Paul Ferrol. Earlier, signing herself George Ferrol and P. Ferrol, she had sent poems first to Isaac D'Israeli, then to the philosopher Dugald Stewart, who passed them on to the poet Thomas Campbell. Campbell's response was encouraging, but it was not until 1840, a few months before her marriage, that her first book of verse, <span class="italic">IX Poems by V.</span>, made its appearance. Appreciatively noticed by Henry Nelson Coleridge in &#145;Modern English poetesses&#146;, an article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (September 1840), as well as by other reviewers, the book established her reputation as one of the leading female poets of the day. A second edition, with nine additional poems, came out in 1841. Most of the poems are conventional late Romantic lyrics, gloomy and graceful, but George Saintsbury, in <span class="italic">A History of Nineteenth Century Literature</span> (1876), which remained in print until well into the twentieth century, remembered them as &#145;really good&#146;  (Saintsbury, 310). Over the next twelve years she had five long poems published, as well as <span class="italic">Saint Oldooman: a Myth of the Nineteenth Century</span> (1845), a prose satire on Newman's <span class="italic">Lives of the Saints</span>. The best and most admired of the poems was <span class="italic">The Queen's Ball: a Poem by V.</span> (1847), based on a report that 150 dead people had been invited to a ball given by Queen Victoria; the poem contains a few good lines and many poor ones. &#145;V.&#146;, the pseudonym which Clive adopted for nearly all her poetic works, was short for Vigolina, Archer Clive's dog-Latin translation of Wigley, her maiden name. In 1847 she met both Mary Russell Mitford and Elizabeth Barrett Browning but was not impressed with either; Browning spoke slightingly of Clive's poetry and personality.<br>
<br>Clive's minor celebrity as a poet was spectacularly eclipsed by the fame and notoriety resulting from her first novel, <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll: a Tale by the Author of &#145;IX Poems by V.&#146;</span>, published in 1855. A forerunner of the sensation novel, it shocked many readers by its apparent amorality. The eponymous hero not only murders his first wife without any perceptible qualms of conscience but also shoots down a rioting workman in cold blood; yet his doting daughter from his marriage to his second wife does not recoil from him when she hears of the murder of the first, and the author herself, in describing the two killings, shows no sign of repugnance towards the killer. Clive was perhaps trying to imitate the &#145;cynicism&#146; of Balzac, whose novels she read avidly; the fact that she had on several earlier occasions used Ferroll or Ferrol as her <i>nom de plume</i> suggests that she identified closely with the hero of her novel, just as Balzac identified with his character Vautrin. In both <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll</span> itself and its sequel, <span class="italic">Why Paul Ferroll Killed his Wife</span> (1860), the hero is even credited with the authorship of well-known poems by Clive herself. <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll</span> was translated into French twice, in 1858 and 1859, and into Russian in 1859. <span class="italic">Why Paul Ferroll Killed his Wife</span>, probably written partly in the hope of appeasing readers who had been scandalized by <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll</span> itself, explains that just before he murdered her Ferroll had found out that his first wife had tricked him into marrying her by telling him, falsely, that the woman he really loved&#151;who later became his second wife&#151;had gone off with another man. Clive's only other published works of fiction, <span class="italic">Year after Year: a Tale</span> (1858) and <span class="italic">John Greswold</span> (1864), aroused much less interest than <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll</span> and its sequel. Collections of her poems were issued in 1856 and 1872; after her death a further collection appeared in 1890, with an introduction by her daughter Alice Greathead.<br>
<br>Accidents in 1860 and 1863 left Clive permanently confined to a wheelchair, and in 1865 she suffered a stroke. She died on 14 July 1873 from injuries received two days before when her dress caught fire in her library at Whitfield. She was survived by her husband. New editions of <span class="italic">IX Poems by V.</span> and <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll</span> were published in 1928 and 1929, both with introductions by Eric Partridge. <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll</span> was reissued in the <span class="roman">Oxford Popular Fiction</span> series in 1997, with an introduction by Charlotte Mitchell.<br>
