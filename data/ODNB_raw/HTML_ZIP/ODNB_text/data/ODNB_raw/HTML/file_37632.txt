<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keppel <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Edmonstone]</span>,  Alice Frederica</span>  (1868&#150;1947), <span class="occ">mistress of King Edward VII</span>, was born at Woolwich Dockyard on 29 April 1868, the youngest of the nine children (eight daughters and one son) of William Edmonstone (1810&#150;1888), naval commodore (later admiral), superintendent of Woolwich Dockyard, and later fourth baronet, of Duntreath Castle, Stirlingshire, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parsons (<i>d</i>. 1902). Educated at home, Alice early on showed evidence of the beauty, tact, and vivacity for which she was to become renowned. On 1 June 1891 she married George Keppel (1865&#150;1947), third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15444/', "William Coutts Keppel, seventh earl of Albemarle")</script>. There were two children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76253/', "Violet Trefusis (1894&#150;1972)")</script>, who later won notoriety for her turbulent love affair with Victoria (&#145;Vita&#146;) Sackville-West, and Sonia Rosemary (1900&#150;1986).<br>
<br>Early in 1898 the twenty-nine-year-old Alice Keppel met&#151;and soon became the mistress of&#151;the fifty-six-year-old Albert Edward, prince of Wales [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32975/', "Edward VII")</script>]. His accession to the throne in 1901 as King Edward VII in no way diminished her role; not only did she maintain her position as <i>ma&icirc;tresse en titre</i> but she became one of the leading personalities of the Edwardian court, in which environment her daughters were effectively brought up. Throughout the ten years of Edward VII's reign, Mrs Keppel, as she was generally known, was an accepted, respected, and highly visible member of the royal entourage. She often travelled abroad with the court&#151;notably to the king's favourite resort of Biarritz&#151;and remained, in the widely used phrase, &#145;la favorita&#146;. Her ability to keep the notoriously impatient monarch amused was greatly appreciated in royal and government circles. Baron Hardinge of Penhurst, at that time the permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, later paid tribute to her &#145;excellent influence&#146;, notably on occasions when the king was in disagreement with his department:<blockquote>&hellip; I was able, through her, to advise the king with a view to the policy of Government being accepted &hellip; It would have been difficult to have found any other lady who would have filled the part of friend to King Edward with the same loyalty and discretion. (Souhami, 10)</blockquote>She herself disclaimed the role of royal confidante on constitutional matters; the duchess of Marlborough ascribed the durability of her relationship with the king to shared interests; &#145;she invariably knew the choicest scandal, the price of stock, the latest political move&#146;  (Aronson, 212). She was also an adept card player. Other contemporaries attested to her ability to amuse without malice and to the absence of snobbery from her character; she was, however, fascinated with the power of money and financially astute. She cultivated people like the financier Sir Ernest Cassel and is known to have enriched herself by the sale of shares presented to her by her royal lover.<br>
<br>The widely believed story that as King Edward VII lay dying, his wife, Queen Alexandra, magnanimously sent for Mrs Keppel to take leave of him, is inaccurate. It was much against the will of the queen&#151;who had tolerated the affair in public, but was less forgiving in private&#151;that Alice Keppel saw the dying king, at her own insistence. On being asked to leave the death chamber, she made an embarrassing scene and had to be escorted out; Viscount Esher coldly described it as &#145;a painful and rather theatrical exhibition &hellip; [which] ought never to have happened&#146;  (Souhami, 91). Afterwards, in an effort to safeguard her position, Alice claimed that the queen had summoned her, and promised to look after her in the future. During the First World War, in which her husband saw active service, Alice Keppel divided her time between entertaining in her London home, at 16 Grosvenor Street, and staying in various country houses. She also helped her friend Lady Sarah Wilson run a hospital for wounded soldiers in Boulogne. In the mid-1920s the Keppels sold their London house and bought the Villa dell'Ombrellino, Bellosguardo, Florence. Celebrated as the ex-mistress of Edward VII, as an international <i>grande dame</i>, and as a matchless hostess, Alice Keppel reigned like a queen over Florentine society. During the Second World War the Keppels established themselves at the Ritz Hotel in London. At the end of the war they returned to the Villa dell'Ombrellino where Alice died of liver disease on 11 September 1947. She was buried in a protestant cemetery, I Allori, Florence. Obituaries made discreet reference to her friendship with the king and queen; <span class="italic">The Times</span> recorded her passing as marking the end of an era, noting obliquely that &#145;discretion was perhaps her long suit&#146;. George Keppel survived her by little more than two months, while her devoted daughter Violet wrote that she had &#145;lost everything &hellip; any little success I may have is dedicated to her&#146;  (Souhami, 290).<br>
