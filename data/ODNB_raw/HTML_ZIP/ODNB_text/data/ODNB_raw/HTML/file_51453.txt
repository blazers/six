<span class="headword">Coghlan,  Rose</span>  (1851&#150;1932), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Peterborough, Lincolnshire, on 18 March 1851, the daughter of Francis Coghlan, the author and publisher of <span class="italic">Coghlan's Continental Guides</span>, and his wife, Anna Marie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kirby. Her elder brother <a name="cosubject_51454"></a><span class="headword">Charles Francis Coghlan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1842&#150;1899)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Paris, and to whom she was very close, studied law and later decided on a career in the theatre; Rose followed him on to the stage. Rose Coghlan made her first appearance at the Theatre Royal in Greenock, Renfrewshire, in 1865, playing one of the witches in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, and made her London d&eacute;but as Pippo in <span class="italic">Linda of Chamouni</span> (Old Gaiety, September 1869). In the early 1870s she met the actor&#150;manager Charles Calvert, who cast her as Nerissa in a production of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>.<br>
<br>Coghlan went to the United States in 1872 to work with Lydia Thompson's burlesque company, and it was there that she built a solid reputation as a leading actress, performing major roles until the early 1920s. She acquired American citizenship in 1902. In the 1880s she became a leading lady with Lester Wallack's stock company, and in such roles as Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (1880), Stephanie in <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span> (1880), and Lady Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1882) she was a considerable critical and popular success. J. Rankin Towse termed her Lady Teazle &#145;one of the best witnessed by this generation&#146;  (Towse, 409). Frederic Edward McKay wrote of her as Rosalind: &#145;Miss Coghlan has conceived the character as it existed in the mind of the master, and represents it with a fidelity to truth almost marvelous in its near approach to perfection&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Star</span>, 1 Oct 1880).<br>
<br>Many critics commented on the quality of Coghlan's voice. McKay praised her &#145;mellifluous vocalism&#146;: &#145;it seemed to me the Aeolian harp had been revivified&#146;  (McKay and Wingate, 250); another added, &#145;what a resonant, silvery, mellow voice it is&#146;. Rose, a buxom, golden-haired woman of medium height, with large blue eyes, was a natural for comic roles, and critics praised once and again her &#145;romping spirits&#146; and &#145;sportive gaiety&#146; in such parts as Rosalind and Lady Gay Spanker (in <span class="italic">London Assurance</span>). During her years with Wallack's company she married the lawyer Clinton J. Edgerly (in April 1885), but the marriage soon failed and Edgerly sued her for divorce on grounds of desertion in September 1890. In the 1880s she also adopted a daughter, Rosalind Agnes Coghlan (<i>b</i>. 1881).<br>
<br>Charles Coghlan, meanwhile, was building his reputation in England, where he became known as a perfect type of the modern gentleman. With his dark-haired good looks, he perfected an urbane and easy manner, what critics termed his &#145;reserve force&#146;, and established his theatrical reputation during the Bancrofts' management of the Prince of Wales's Theatre in the 1870&#150;76 seasons. He was a natural for the toned-down realism of Tom Robertson's plays. The critic Clement Scott was a naysayer, however, writing in Coghlan's obituary that his &#145;&#147;reserve force&#148; was merely loss of memory and the inability to make the brain act as quickly as it should&#146;. His style was described as &#145;so easy, so natural&#146;&#151;a quality that worked well in such plays as Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span> (1872) but proved disastrous in the production of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (1875), in which Coghlan played Shylock: &#145;In light comedy he had often held his forces in reserve with great effect. Here he did it to such bad purpose that his performance nearly ruined the Bancrofts.&#146; His subdued characterization, dubbed the &#145;Drawing-Room Shylock&#146;, went counter to the tradition of fierce and emotional acting of the part. Clement Scott termed his Shylock &#145;an absolute inanimate being, without force, without movement, without love, without hate, without expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Drama of Yesterday and Today</span>, 1899, 1.585).<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Coghlan went to the USA and played at Daly's and Palmer's Union Square Theatre in New York, where he assumed such roles as Lovelace in <span class="italic">Clarissa Harlowe</span> and Jean Renaud in <span class="italic">A Celebrated Case</span> (1878). He continued to work in England as well, playing Antony to Lillie Langtry's Cleopatra in 1890, at the Princess's Theatre. Some critics still could not bear his style in a Shakespearian context; G. B. Shaw summed up his Mercutio at the Lyceum in 1895, noting that &#145;he lounges&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dramatic Opinions and Essays</span>, 1901, 1.188); Shaw did approve, however, of his performance as the seducer in <span class="italic">A Woman's Reason</span> (Shaftsbury, 1895): &#145;Mr. Coghlan created the part, like a true actor, by the simple but very unusual method of playing it from his own point of view&#146;  (<span class="italic">Our Theatres in the Nineties</span>, 1932, 2.5). Coghlan also continued to try his hand as a playwright. His first play, <span class="italic">Good as Gold</span>, had been produced at the Lyceum in 1868; <span class="italic">Enemies</span> was produced at the Princess's in 1886.<br>
<br>In 1885 Rose Coghlan had set up her own company in New York, a short-lived venture; she continued to work with Wallack until his retirement in 1888. In 1893 she staged the first American production of Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">A Woman of No Importance</span>, and with Charles she revived <span class="italic">Diplomacy</span> in 1892&#150;3. Her reputation for high-spiritedness remained, and extended into her personal life. She had a second, rather tempestuous marriage to the actor John Taylor Sullivan, beginning on 7 June 1893 (the couple divorced on 11 June 1904); the newspapers followed the ups and downs of her private life, even reporting with horror in 1893 that she rode astride, &#145;like a dragoon&#146;, in Central Park. Her brother caused a scandal of his own in October 1893 when he married the heiress Kuhne Beveridge; it was generally assumed that he was already married to Blanche Wilson, whom he had presented as his wife for many years and with whom he had a daughter, Gertrude (<i>b</i>. 1878). The marriage to Beveridge incited much press coverage and led to a rift with his sister; it was annulled in September 1894, and Charles was reconciled with his first wife. In the late 1890s he toured the USA in a repertory that included his own play <span class="italic">Lady Barter</span>; it was during this tour that he became ill with acute gastritis, and he died in Galveston, Texas, on 27 November 1899. His coffin, along with many others, was washed away in the Galveston flood of 1900 (it was recovered four years later), an incident that led to persistent reports in later years that he had died during the flood itself.<br>
<br>After the turn of the century Rose Coghlan met increasing difficulty finding work. Since the mid-1890s she had been plagued by financial problems, and in 1898 she began to work on the vaudeville circuit, where she was employed over the next twenty years. Opportunities to appear in plays became less frequent, though, when she did find roles, she excelled. As Penelope in the ill-fated 1903 New York production of Stephen Phillips's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, she &#145;almost single-handedly&#146; saved the show &#145;from instant and ignominious collapse&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Evening Post</span>, 15 April 1922).<br>
<br>Other notable appearances from Rose's later years included a tour in Shaw's <span class="italic">Mrs Warren's Profession</span> in 1907 and roles in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> and <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> at Winthrop Ames's New Theatre in 1910. She acquired some work in films, notably in <span class="italic">The Sporting Duchess</span> (1915) and <span class="italic">Beyond the Rainbow</span> (1922). Her last stage success came at the age of seventy, when she played Madame Rabouin in Harley Granville Barker's adaptation of Sacha Guitry's <span class="italic">Deburau</span> (Belasco, 1920). The <span class="italic">New York Post</span>, in a largely dismissive review, called her small performance &#145;one of the chief artistic features of the evening&#146;; &#145;she vivified the whole picture&#151;even the dialogue, poor stuff that it was, assumed significance as uttered in her clear, crisp, and deeply suggestive delivery&#146;  (24 Dec 1920).<br>
<br>Two years later Coghlan was destitute. A benefit was held for her in New York at the Apollo Theatre (set up by the Producing Managers' Association), which raised $10,000. She then retired to St Vincent's Retreat, Harrison, New York, a sanatorium run by Catholic nuns. According to some reports she was under the care of the Actors' Fund of America and the National Vaudeville Artists' Association. In November 1924 she offered at auction her collection of autographed photographs. She died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 2 April 1932 at St Vincent's Retreat, and was cremated on the 4th at Fresh Pond crematorium, Middle Village, Queens, New York.<br>
