<span class="headword">Knox,  Thomas Francis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Francis]</span>  (1822&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and scholar</span>, was born in Brussels, Belgium, on 24 December 1822. He was the eldest son of the Hon. John Henry Knox (1788&#150;1872), the third son of the second Viscount Northland, first earl of Ranfurly, and of his wife, Lady Mabella Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Needham (1801&#150;1899), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19843/', "Francis Needham, first earl of Kilmorey")</script>. The Knoxes were Irish protestants long settled in co. Tyrone. Knox was educated at a private school in Hampshire. In 1840 he was admitted as a pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in Michaelmas 1841, became a scholar in 1843, and took a first-class BA degree in 1845, coming third in the classical tripos, and being among the senior optimes in mathematics and second chancellor's medallist. Because he had resigned his parish in 1843, J. H. Newman refused to become Knox's spiritual director in March 1845, but offered him a home at his retreat outside Oxford at Littlemore. Later in the same year Knox was staying with F. W. Faber when Faber and his followers decided to convert to Catholicism. He was received into the Catholic church with them by Bishop Wareing at Northampton on 17 November. He told the Oxford Movement's leader, Edward Bouverie Pusey, that the Church of England was &#145;a delusion of Satan&#146;  (Chapman, 119). His worried father suggested that he should travel for two years, and he left at Easter 1846 for North America and the West Indies.<br>
<br>Wanting to see &#145;the Church in all its splendour&#146; in Mexico  (Kerr, 2.61), he took a mail steamer, the <i>Tweed</i>, sailing from Havana to Vera Cruz, but on 12 February 1847 the ship foundered on the Alacranes Reef 95 miles off the north coast of Yucat&aacute;n. Nearly everyone who was travelling with him in the fore part of the ship perished, but he clambered over the bulwarks and clung overnight to the ship's side, saying the rosary and the <span class="italic">Memorare</span> and vowing to the Virgin Mary to enter the ecclesiastical state if saved. Though unable to swim, at daybreak he rode on a spar through boiling breakers to the reef, where the aft of the ship lay aground with the surviving passengers and crew. After two and a half days of standing on the reef, much of the time in tidal water, he and his companions were rescued on 15 February by the Spanish brig <i>Aemilio</i>.<br>
<br>Knox was detained from keeping his vow by revolution in Yucat&aacute;n but travelled to the United States. He was at first uncertain of his father's financial support and decided to prepare for ordination in France. On 28 June 1847 he enrolled in the S&eacute;minaire de St Sulpice at Issy near Paris, preparatory to entering the Parisian Grand S&eacute;minaire. On Newman's urging, he came at the beginning of November to Rome, where Newman and his friends were staying at Santa Croce while serving their novitiate to become Oratorians. He accompanied Newman and Ambrose St John on 3 December 1847 to the Vatican to present the brief for the English Oratory, and met Pope Pius IX: &#145;Knox was in raptures,&#146; Newman reported to John Dobr&eacute;e Dalgairns; &#145;the Pope called him Padre Francesco, and Knox declares he won't part with it&#146;  (Newman to Dalgairns, 21 Dec 1847, <span class="italic">Letters and Diaries</span>, 12.135). Knox chose Francis as his name in religion when he was admitted as an Oratorian novice at Maryvale, Old Oscott, near Birmingham, on the inception of the community on 1 February 1848. He accompanied Faber to London in 1849 to establish the London Oratory, which remained his home for the remaining thirty-three years of his life. On 2 June 1849 he was ordained priest by Bishop Nicholas Wiseman at St Edmund's College, Ware, and said his first Mass the following day, Trinity Sunday. In 1865, he succeeded Father J. D. Dalgairns as the London Oratory's third superior, a post which he held for one term (until 1868).<br>
<br>Knox has been accounted &#145;the most learned of all the fathers of that time&#146; by the principal historian of the London Oratory, Ralph Kerr  (Kerr, 2.62), though this title should probably go to Dalgairns. He became the Westminster diocesan archivist when, in 1876, Manning entrusted the archives to the Oratorians, and he wrote the introductions for <span class="italic">The First and Second Diaries of the English College, Douay</span> (1878), and <span class="italic">The Letters and Memorials of William Cardinal Allen, 1532&#150;1594</span> (1882), which he edited with Fathers Richard Stanton and Stephen Keogh and other Oratorians. These works appeared as the first and second volumes of the <span class="roman">Records of the English Catholics under the Penal Laws</span>, the only ones to be published. This task of publishing Catholic records was later taken up by the Catholic Record Society. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Last Survivor of the Ancient English Hierarchy: T. Goldwell, Bishop of St. Asaph</span> (republished from <span class="italic">The Month</span>, 1876), and translated the autobiography of the fourteenth-century mystic Blessed Henry Suso (1865).<br>
<br>Knox's learning was also put to practical effect. He became the <i>defensor matrimoniorum</i> of the archdiocese of Westminster and, in 1874, the notary in the diocesan process for the canonization of the English Catholic martyrs, preliminary to the beatification of John Fisher and Sir Thomas More. He was a member of the council of the Catholic Union, secretary to a commission of inquiry on Catholic education in England, and lecturer on canon law to ordinands at the diocesan seminary. A high ultramontane, his treatise <span class="italic">When does the church speak infallibly? or, The nature and scope of the church's teaching office</span> (1867) took a maximalist line on its subject, but its dry and moderate tone attracted Italian theologians who wanted a work on papal infallibility for international dissemination which was &#145;not controversial but doctrinal, learned yet popular, brief and yet pithy&#146;  (Kerr, 2.63&#150;4). Father Cardella accordingly translated Knox's work into Italian. Pius IX sent Knox a special commendation in 1870, and conferred a doctorate upon him in 1875. He died at his home in London, the Oratory, Brompton, of heart disease on 20 March 1882, and was buried in south London at the Oratorian private cemetery in Sydenham.<br>
