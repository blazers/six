<span class="headword">Holland,  Edmund</span>, seventh earl of Kent  (1383&#150;1408), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the third and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13544/', "Thomas Holland, fifth earl of Kent (1350&#150;1397)")</script>, and Alice (<i>d</i>. 1416), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9534/', "Richard (II) Fitzalan, third earl of Arundel")</script>. He had two brothers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13545/', "Thomas Holland, sixth earl of Kent and duke of Surrey (c.1374&#150;1400)")</script>, and Richard, who died young; and six sisters: Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1405), wife first of Roger (VII) Mortimer, earl of March, and then of Edward, Baron Charlton of Powys; Joan (<i>d</i>. 1434), wife of Edmund, duke of York, William, Lord Willoughby, Henry, Lord Scrope of Masham, and Henry Bromflete, Lord Vessy; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98133/', "Margaret Holland (b. in or before 1388, d. 1439)")</script>, wife of John Beaufort, earl of Somerset, and Thomas, duke of Clarence; Eleanor (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1420), wife of Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury; Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1423), wife of John, Lord Neville; and Bridget, a nun.<br>
<br>Holland's career as a court nobleman began in 1398 with his award, as &#145;king's nephew&#146;, of an exchequer annuity of 100 marks. He went to Ireland with Richard II in 1399 and was left there when the king with his close supporters, including Edmund's brother Thomas and his uncle John, returned to England to confront Henry Bolingbroke in August of that year. Edmund only finally returned from Ireland on 13 January 1400, and was seized on landing at Liverpool following the collapse of the rebellion of his brother and uncle against the new king, Henry IV. The death as a rebel of his brother Thomas left Holland as the heir to the Kent inheritance, but landless, since the inheritance was forfeited. However, Henry IV had a dearth of natural magnate support, and Holland, who was gradually making his mark at court, was restored to his estates and titles on 1 July 1403; he fought for the king against the Percys at the battle of Shrewsbury shortly afterwards. His brief career was dogged by impecuniosity: his inheritance was curtailed by the claims of three surviving dowager countesses of Kent, and in the aftermath of the 1400 rebellion some Kent estates were repossessed by the king, who claimed them to be rightfully part of his duchy of Lancaster inheritance. He did come to an advantageous agreement with one of the countesses, Joan, widow of his late brother Thomas, in January 1404, whereby she agreed to accept less than her full entitlement of dower estates, but his career continued to be dictated by the need to secure further royal patronage at court.<br>
<br>Holland first appeared in royal council in 1405 and he soon began to take up his father Thomas's reins on the south coast, acting as a JP in Dorset, Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, and Sussex, and investigating Beaulieu Abbey's problems in 1406 and 1407. Yet he impressed more militarily, serving at sea under Prince Thomas, Henry's second son, in 1405, and distinguishing himself at Sluys and along the Norman coast. He jousted against the earl of Mar at Smithfield in 1406 and was made a knight of the Order of the Garter. On 24 January 1407 he was married in St Mary Overie's, Southwark, to Lucia Visconti (1380&#150;1424), one of the ten daughters of Bernab&ograve; Visconti, sometime lord of Milan. She should have brought a dowry of 70,000 florins to help Holland's finances, but her executor's executor was still pursuing claims for it in the 1470s. Holland was appointed admiral of the west and north in 1407. The piracy problem in the English Channel was an ever prevalent menace, and he received his first major independent command in March 1408 to sweep the channel in a series of patrols. This he did, though the successful assault on the &Icirc;le de Br&eacute;hat, off Brittany, for Henry IV's queen, Joan, marked the end of his brief career: he discarded his helmet and was cut down by a crossbow quarrel through the head. He was buried at Bourne Abbey in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>Holland left no heir, although he did have an illegitimate daughter, Eleanor, with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57622/', "Constance Despenser (c.1375&#150;1416)")</script>, the daughter of Edmund, duke of York; Eleanor later married James Touchet, Lord Audley. Edmund Holland's widow, Lucia, remained in England and died in 1424. She was buried in the Austin Friars in London. The Kent inheritance was divided after 1408 between the four surviving dowager countesses of Kent and Holland's five sisters and their heirs.<br>
