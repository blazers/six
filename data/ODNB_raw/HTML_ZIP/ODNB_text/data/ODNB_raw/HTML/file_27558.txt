<span class="headword">Torkington,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1511&#150;1518), <span class="occ">Catholic priest and pilgrim</span>, is of unknown origins. In 1511 he was presented by Sir Thomas Boleyn, later earl of Wiltshire, to the Norfolk rectory of Mulberton, and he was still parson there when in 1517 he undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. According to his own account of his experiences he left Rye on 20 March, and passed through France to northern Italy. After some time in Turin, Milan, and Pavia (where he noted the tomb of Lionel of Antwerp, second son of Edward III), on 29 April he arrived in Venice. There he witnessed the ceremony of the city's &#145;marriage to the sea&#146; and also observed the building of new ships in the arsenal, recording that twenty-three new ships were then being constructed by over a thousand workmen; a hundred hands were busy at rope making alone.<br>
<br>On 14 June Torkington sailed from Venice with other pilgrims. They travelled by way of Corfu, Zante, Cerigo, and Crete, sighted the Holy Land on 11 July, and landed at Jaffa four days later. On 18 July they reached Jerusalem and stayed for just over a week, until the 27th. Torkington lodged in the hospital of St James on Mount Sion and visited all the holy places, both in Jerusalem and in Bethlehem. His response to the various shrines and relics seems to have been uncritical, recording without comment the legends attached to them; thus he accepts that the Dome of the Rock was the veritable Temple of Herod. He notes many times his fear of Muslim attack, and expresses strong views on Turkish misrule in Palestine. Nevertheless, it was in a spirit of rejoicing and gratitude that his company sailed for home on 31 July.<br>
<br>Torkington's return to England was considerably more troubled than his outward passage. The ship was detained for a month in Cyprus, and he was later left behind ill in Rhodes, where he stayed for about six weeks in September and October, in the care of the knights of St John. Further progress was hampered by storms, which drove his ship back down the Adriatic. On 20 February 1518 he witnessed a Jewish wedding on Corfu, but eventually returned north by way of Sicily and the west coast of Italy, where he visited Naples and Rome. He did not reach Dover until 17 April, when he reckoned that he had been out of England for one year, five weeks, and three days. He concluded his pilgrimage at the shrine of St Thomas in Canterbury Cathedral on 18 May following.<br>
<br>The rest of Torkington's life is as obscure as its earlier years, and it is only possible to say that he was no longer rector of Mulberton by 1526, when a successor was appointed. His account of his pilgrimage remained in manuscript until the late nineteenth century. Two transcripts survive in the British Library, London, as Add. MSS 28561 and 28562: the former is of the sixteenth century, the latter is the work of Robert Bell Wheler, who also published an account of the text in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for October 1812. The journal was finally edited for publication by W. J. Loftie in 1884, with the title <span class="italic">Ye Oldest Diarie of Englysshe Travell &hellip; the Pilgrimage of Sir Richard Torkyngton</span>. Subsequent comparisons have revealed a marked lack of originality on Torkington's part. His descriptions of Candia seem to have been copied from early editions of <span class="italic">Informacon for Pylgrymes unto the Holy Londe</span> (editions of 1498, 1515, 1524), including an erroneous reference to <span class="roman">Acts</span> instead of <span class="roman">Titus</span> for St Paul's condemnation of the Cretans. And his account of the wonders of Venice and the Holy Land, and of what he saw between the two, agrees almost verbatim with that written by the chaplain of Sir Richard Guildford, as it was published by Pynson in 1511. Torkington does, however, add the occasional observation of his own, especially on the subject of relics.<br>
