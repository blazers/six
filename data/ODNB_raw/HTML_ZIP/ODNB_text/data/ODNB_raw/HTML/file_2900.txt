<span class="headword">Boothroyd,  Benjamin</span>  (1768&#150;1836), <span class="occ">Independent minister and Hebrew scholar</span>, was born at Warley, in the parish of Halifax, Yorkshire, on 10 October 1768, the son of a poor shoemaker there. He was sent to the village school, and left it when six years old, able to read the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments. He helped his father to make shoes for a time, but when about fourteen years old he ran away with only a few pence in his pocket. Making for Lancashire, he found work with a Methodist, who treated him very kindly. Boothroyd stayed with him until, hearing things were not well with his parents, he returned to Warley to superintend his father's business. About 1785 he vowed to devote himself to religion: he attended and spoke at prayer meetings and read Doddridge's works. Eventually he was admitted as a student at the dissenting college at Northowram, where he immediately made a favourable impression. In 1790 he was chosen minister at Pontefract, and after being ordained there he attracted so large a congregation that a new chapel had to be built.<br>
<br>At this time Boothroyd found that all that was left of his income, after paying expenses, was &pound;20 a year, and he opened a shop as a bookseller and printer. In 1801 he was financially secure enough to marry a Miss Hurst (<i>d</i>. 1832) of Pontefract, with whom he had four daughters and four sons. In 1807, having received notes for a history of the town from a Richard Hepworth, he added to them and brought out, at his own press, his <span class="italic">History of the Ancient Borough of Pontefract</span>. His next project was the production of a new Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He mastered the language and printed the work himself, while his wife helped him in correcting the proofs. It was brought out in quarterly parts, the issue beginning in 1810 and finishing in 1813 under the title of <span class="italic">Biblia Hebraica</span>, and finally formed two volumes. Seven years were spent over this undertaking. At the same time Boothroyd preached diligently and published several excellent standard works, besides many sermons of his own.<br>
<br>In 1818 Boothroyd (who had accepted the degree of LLD) became co-pastor at Highfield Chapel, Huddersfield, with William Moorhouse. In the same year he completed his <span class="italic">New Family Bible and Improved Version</span>, in three volumes. He printed many copies of this book at his own press. The University of Glasgow conferred on Boothroyd the degree of DD in 1824. In 1835 Boothroyd completed an octavo edition of his <span class="italic">Family Bible</span>. On 10 January 1836 he became ill; he died on 8 September and was buried at Huddersfield.<br>
