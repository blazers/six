<span class="headword">Coote, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">soldier and political administrator</span>, was the elder of the two sons of Sir Nicholas Coote and his second wife, Eleanor Stanhope. Sir Nicholas had been a retainer of the duke of Norfolk, in whose cause he struck the attorney-general, for which he was fined &pound;20,000. He spent some time in prison and at last was obliged (with his son's permission) to sell off part of his estates to pay the fine.<br>
<br>Charles is said to have been at Cambridge in 1591, and then served as a captain under Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, in 1600&#150;03, the concluding three years of the Nine Years' War; in 1605 he was appointed provost-marshal of Connaught for life. His marriage about 1610 to Dorothea, daughter of Hugh Cuffe of Cuffeswood, co. Cork, brought them four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Coote was sworn onto the privy council and promoted vice-president of Connacht in 1620, and created a baronet of Ireland the following year. In 1621, too, Coote was appointed sovereign of the newly created corporation of Jamestown, strategically situated on a crossing of the River Shannon in co. Leitrim. The landmark 1622 commission on the government of Ireland queried why the royal revenue in Connacht was &#145;strangely lost and reduced to nothing&#146;  (Treadwell, 201) and criticized the cost of fortifying the tiny settlement with a large bastioned <i>enceinte</i>. Some commissioners suggested that Coote financed his recent meteoric rise through embezzlement of the composition rent in Connacht; he was, they said, &#145;a stirring man fuller of wit than judgement, very pragmatical but his own ends so much in his eye as he is become an eye sore to the country who have grievously complained against him for extortion&#146;  (Canny, 255).<br>
<br>Coote, however, was protected by his patron George Villiers, from 1623 duke of Buckingham. Firmly ensconced as James I's favourite, Buckingham was able to ward off Coote's many enemies and he even extended his Jamestown contract to include Charlestown in adjacent co. Roscommon. Coote picked up many properties scattered throughout the midlands as these were planted from 1620 onward. These included Castlecoote on another river crossing on the Roscommon&#150;Galway border and Dowbally in co. Cavan where he built a large ironworks. He set up another ironworks at Drumanlasse in co. Leitrim. Further south he acquired an estate of 500 acres at Castlecuffe and another of 400 acres at Mountrath, both in the north of Queen's county (Laois). In contrast to Jamestown, Mountrath developed into a model plantation nucleated settlement based on the Coote's works for the manufacture of linen, fustian and woollen cloth. Coote was returned for Queen's county in the 1639&#150;41 parliament.<br>
<br>The usually dominant office-holding faction to which Coote belonged was closely connected through marriage alliances and business interests and was headed by Richard Boyle, earl of Cork; &#145;all birds of a feather and the earl of Cork's party&#146;  (Perceval-Maxwell, 87&#150;8). In 1630 Coote went to London to lobby for a plantation of Ormond and the following year, in concert with Cork, he proposed a plantation of Sligo, Roscommon, and Mayo. Coote's advocacy of plantation was more sympathetically received following the appointment of Lord Deputy Wentworth in 1633. The following year Coote was appointed as one of the commissioners &#145;to secure defective titles&#146;, this being the legal mechanism whereby peacetime land confiscations could be set in train.<br>
<br>The origins of the October 1641 rising can be traced in part to the instability and resentment provoked by these plantations. Despite his advanced age&#151;he was described in 1627 as being &#145;old and infirm&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1625&#150;32</i>, 220)&#151;Coote was appointed as governor of Dublin in November 1641 and commissioned to raise a regiment. He led successful attacks on insurgent positions surrounding the city, south towards Wicklow in November 1641 and north towards Swords and Kilsallaghan in January and February 1642. However, his killing of innocent civilians on the Wicklow expedition came at a politically inopportune time when the Old English palesmen were debating whether to join the insurgents. If Bellings, a normally restrained Irish commentator, is to be believed, one such incident involved &#145;his calling a simple country fellow from the plow to have him blow his pistoll, which the simple man, in obedience to Sir Charles Coote's command, performs readily, he shootes him in the mouth and kills him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Confederation</span>, ed. Gilbert, 1.35). Reports of such alleged atrocities gave credence, in Irish Catholic eyes, to rumours that the government planned to massacre them.<br>
<br>Otherwise, Coote proved to be an active and successful military commander, most notably in leading a cavalry detachment to relieve the midland garrisons of Birr, Borris, and Knocknamease in April 1642, &#145;after surmounting incredible difficulties and a march of forty eight hours without the intermission of more than three hours rest&#146;  (Carte, 3.314), in the teeth of stiff insurgent resistance. On rejoining the main army he participated in a follow-up victory at Kilrush when an insurgent army tried to block the return of Ormond's army to Dublin. Ormond left Coote to garrison Naas. Subsequently Coote helped to capture Philipstown (Daingean) and Trim. On 7 May 1642 he was shot dead while repelling an insurgent counter-attack on Trim, &#145;whether by the enemy or by one of his own troopers, was variously reported&#146;  (Archdall, 2.67). His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6240/', "Charles Coote (c.1610&#150;1661)")</script>, succeeded him as second baronet and in 1660 was created first earl of Mountrath.<br>
