<span class="headword">Proud,  Joseph</span>  (1745&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Swedenborgian preacher and hymn writer</span>, was born at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, on 22 March 1745, the son of John Proud (<i>d</i>. 1784), a General Baptist minister, and his wife. He quickly entered the ministry, assisting his father at Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, in 1767, then at General Baptist churches at Knipton, Leicestershire (1772&#150;5), and Fleet, Lincolnshire (1775&#150;86). In 1786 he was called to a chapel in Ber Street, Norwich. By conviction a universalist, he was hostile to the growing evangelical New Connexion. Perhaps in search of a belief structure as appealing as the new Calvinism, he swung dramatically when he heard a Swedenborgian, J. W. Salmon, preach.<br>
<br>Proud was expelled from the General Baptist conference in 1791, but in June 1790 he had moved to Birmingham to commence a Swedenborgian congregation there, occupying himself in the meantime by writing the first Swedenborgian hymnbook. In May 1791 he was ordained into the ministry of the New Jerusalem church, and in June a grand temple was opened with a flourish and some puzzled attention from Priestley and the Unitarians, but it was saved from burning in the church and king riots a month later only when Proud insisted on the patriotism of the congregation. This indeed was Proud's view; he was far from the radical experimentation of other early Swedenborgians, lacking the interest in the intricacies of Swedenborgian thought of other devoted followers, and feeling uneasy enough to abandon extemporaneous preaching on joining the sect. He wore robes to officiate as minister, but the grand temple had to be abandoned a year later when the society's sponsor defaulted. He was on friendly terms with the Unitarians and preached at their chapel in Warwick in 1792. After a brief ministry in Manchester in 1793&#150;4 and a period of ministry in a humbler chapel in Paradise Street, Birmingham, he was invited by the &#145;high-church&#146; Swedenborgians to form a London congregation for them in a chapel erected in Cross Street, Hatton Gardens, and then, after a dispute with the proprietors, moved to York Street, St James, drawing large and fashionable crowds with his blend of evangelical rhetoric, high-church ritual, and simplified Swedenborgian ideas. After 1813 his success faded. A much humbler chapel was hired in Lisle Street, Leicester Square, but soon after this in 1814 Proud retired to Birmingham.<br>
<br>Proud was married twice; first on 3 February 1769, from which marriage he had eleven children, only two of whom survived, and second in 1785 to Susannah, a widow, who died on 21 November 1827; none of the three children from his second marriage lived beyond childhood. Proud died at Handsworth, Birmingham, on 3 August 1826, and was buried in St George's churchyard, Birmingham, on 20 August, when his funeral sermon was preached by Edward Madeley. Proud's success was typical of idiosyncratic preachers in the protestant world of London, the equivalent of the contemporary televangelists.<br>
