<span class="headword">Sant,  James</span>  (1820&#150;1916), <span class="occ">portrait and genre painter</span>, was born on 23 April 1820 in Croydon, Surrey, the son of William Sant (1787&#150;1850), and his wife, Sarah Maria Baker (1793&#150;1868). During the 1830s Sant studied with John Varley and Augustus Wall Callcott, and from 1842 to 1846 at the Royal Academy Schools. He exhibited his first painting at the academy in 1840. On 15 July 1851 he married Eliza (1833&#150;1907), daughter of Dr R. M. M. Thomson, staff surgeon in Bengal; they had two sons and five daughters. He gained popular acclaim for his idealized depictions of childhood (occasionally modelled on his own children), which were widely disseminated through engravings. His most successful paintings include <span class="italic">The Children in the Wood</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">Little Red Riding-Hood</span> (1860).<br>
<br>Later in his career Sant became a fashionable painter of social and political luminaries. The extensive series of portraits that he produced for Frances, Countess Waldegrave, was exhibited at the French Gallery in 1861. In that same year Sant was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, becoming a full academician in 1869. In 1877 he was elected a corresponding member of La Regia Accademia Raffaello in Urbino. On 19 January 1871 Queen Victoria appointed Sant her principal painter, but his inability to capture an acceptable likeness made her refuse to sit to him. State portraits for Japan and the embassies of Turkey and Madrid were among the few he completed. He had far greater success with sweetly sentimental paintings of the queen's children and grandchildren.<br>
<br>Although Sant's best-known works are executed in a carefully polished style, he experimented with the loose brushwork and outdoor lighting effects of impressionism in works such as <span class="italic">Miss Martineau's Garden</span> of 1873 (Tate collection). In a lecture of 1871 Sir Coutts Lindsay named Sant among the contemporary painters who were influencing the direction of English art. He later invited Sant to exhibit at the progressive Grosvenor Gallery. Although Sant described himself as shy, he was not without daring. When a new client arrived at his studio heavily made up with rouge and powder he reportedly remarked, &#145;I see we both paint&#146;  (Ward, 283). A prolific artist with an exceptionally long career, he exhibited over 300 paintings at the Royal Academy from 1840 to 1916. He was appointed CVO in 1914 and resigned from the academy that year, &#145;wishing to afford an opportunity of full membership to an Associate&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 July 1916, 11). Sant died at his home, 43 Lancaster Gate, Hyde Park, London, on 12 July 1916 and was buried three days later at Kensal Green cemetery, leaving a large estate valued at &pound;35,981. His surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98096/', "Mowbray Lees Sant")</script>, was chief constable of Surrey.<br>
