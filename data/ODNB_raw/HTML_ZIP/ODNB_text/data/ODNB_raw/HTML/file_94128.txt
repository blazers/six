<span class="headword">Walker,  Eric Anderson</span>  (1886&#150;1976), <span class="occ">historian of South Africa</span>, was born at Craigmore, Polworth Road, Streatham, London, on 6 September 1886, the eldest son of William Walker (1851&#150;1927) of Leith, Scotland, mercantile clerk, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goodman. From Mill Hill School he won a scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, where he missed a blue as an oarsman but was awarded a first in modern history in 1908. His first post was lecturer in history at the University College of Bristol, and while there he co-wrote a textbook for secondary schools on English history which went through many editions.<br>
<br>In 1911 Walker decided to take up a lectureship at the South African College in Cape Town, in the newly established Union of South Africa. Two of his uncles were in South Africa, and his father worked for the Union Castle Line, which sailed between Britain and the Cape. Before he left England, Walker heard that the first professor of history at the South African College had resigned. He was appointed to the chair three months after arriving, not yet twenty-five, and was to remain in Cape Town for the next twenty-five years. In 1913 he married Lucy Stapleton (1883&#150;1977), with whom he had two daughters. He would have served in France during the First World War had he not damaged his heart lifting heavy ammunition as a member of the Cape garrison artillery, which he joined in 1912. As a captain in that regiment he spent many months during the war watching for German ships off Cape Town.<br>
<br>In 1918 the South African College became the University of Cape Town, and Walker made his one of the leading departments in the university. He was an outstanding teacher who made a great impression on his students, and the first-year survey course he introduced in 1923 survived for sixty years. In the early 1930s he served on the university's council and was dean of the arts faculty. Smuts was to suggest that had Walker been available, he would have been appointed principal in 1937.<br>
<br>But it was above all as a pioneer in the writing and development of South African history that Walker made his name. Despite his heavy teaching load he was enormously prolific. He compiled the first historical atlas of South Africa (1922), wrote the first one-volume history of South Africa for the main examination taken in schools (1926), and produced the first scholarly synthesis of South African history (1928). He also published a biography of Lord Henry de Villiers, the former chief justice of the Cape (1925), and a centenary history of the University of Cape Town (1929). He penned many articles for the <span class="italic">Round Table</span>, and was the South African adviser of, and a contributor to, the eighth volume of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of the British Empire</span> (1936).<br>
<br>From the mid-1920s, as Afrikaner nationalism was in its ascendancy, Walker became increasingly alienated from South African affairs, and he was shocked that the franchise enjoyed by Cape Africans could be under threat. He nevertheless went as a member of the South African delegation to the British Commonwealth relations conference held in Toronto in 1933, and the following year published a history of the great trek (1934) that presented it as a great romantic adventure. In later life he regarded this as his best and most readable book. He then began a sympathetic biography of another Cape liberal, W. P. Schreiner, published in 1937.<br>
<br>In 1936, as he completed his Schreiner biography, Walker was offered the Vere Harmsworth chair of naval history at Cambridge. As he had never been on board a naval vessel, he hastened to Simonstown to rectify the omission; he was pleased that &#145;imperial&#146; was now added to the title of his chair. In Cambridge, where he became a fellow of St John's College, he continued his interest in South African history, but he now also wrote on the empire more broadly; his <span class="italic">The British Empire: its Structure and Spirit</span> (1943) was well regarded; his <span class="italic">Colonies</span> (1944) was wide-ranging and considered the motives for colonization, the policies of the colonial powers, including the Soviet Union, and the future of the colonial empires.<br>
<br>In the Second World War Walker acted as an air-raid warden in Cambridge, where by the end of 1942 he was the only history professor still teaching. In February 1944 Smuts asked him to return to South Africa to be editor-in-chief of the South African war histories. Uncertain whether to accept, he agreed to go, and then had a severe mental breakdown. After remaining in a mental hospital for over a year, he underwent a leucotomy in July 1946, in which part of his brain was removed. He then made a miraculous recovery, and was able to resume his university duties at Cambridge.<br>
<br>In retirement from 1951, Walker brought out a third edition of his <span class="italic">History of Southern Africa</span> (1957) and edited a second edition of the South African volume of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of the British Empire</span> (1963), which was much criticized for being out of date in its approach. His daughter, finding her parents living in poor circumstances in Cambridge, persuaded them to return to South Africa in 1968, the year in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cape Town. He died in Durban on 23 February 1976.<br>
<br>Along with W. M. Macmillan and C. W. de Kiewiet, Walker was one of the three most important historians of South Africa writing in the early twentieth century. If he had lesser analytical skills than they, he had greater flair for narrative and sweep, and he did more to establish history as a profession in South Africa. Though the argument he made about the importance of the frontier in an influential lecture, &#145;The frontier tradition in South Africa&#146; (1930), is now much criticized, and most of his historical work is seen as Eurocentric, his biographies of de Villiers and Schreiner retain their importance. The seminar room of the department of historical studies at the University of Cape Town is named after him.<br>
