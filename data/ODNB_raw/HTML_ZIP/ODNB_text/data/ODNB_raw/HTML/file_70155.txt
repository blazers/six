<span class="headword">Lazarus,  Harris Meyer</span>  (1878&#150;1962), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Riga, Latvia, on 11 June 1878, the eldest son of nine children of Julius Lazarus (Yudel Leiser or Leizera) (1852&#150;1940) and his wife, Esther Golda Itzikovitz (1858&#150;1928). Julius Lazarus emigrated to England about February 1895, and his eldest son, aged nineteen, followed in June 1897, Anglicizing his name Hirsch as Harris. He was naturalized on 18 January 1904. He had received a traditional Jewish education in Riga and had qualified as a <i>shochet</i> (Jewish ritual slaughterman). In January 1898 he entered Jews' College, the training ground for the &#145;native&#146; Anglo-Jewish ministry. He at first studied <i>hazanut</i> (Jewish cantoral music) and then turned to rabbinics, gaining <i>semicha</i> (rabbinical ordination) in 1910. He was also a student at University College, London, graduating BA in 1904 and MA in 1913. Between 1904 and 1906 he taught in the East End at the Toynbee Hall Hebrew training classes. In 1905 Lazarus was appointed minister of the newly built Brondesbury synagogue in north-west London, where he remained until 1938, the only congregational post which he ever held.<br>
<br>In the same year, on 15 June 1905, Lazarus married Ada (1884&#150;1950), the youngest daughter of Rabbi Susman Cohen of Manchester and his wife, Bertha, a daughter of Dayan Jacob Reinovitz (1818&#150;1893). The couple made their home in the Willesden and Brondesbury neighbourhood and had one son and two daughters. Lazarus's father-in-law had served as a <i>dayan</i> or judge on the <i>bet din</i> (ecclesiastical court) of Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler between 1893 and 1906. Lazarus followed in his footsteps. In 1914 he was appointed an assistant <i>dayan</i> and combined his work at the court with his synagogal duties until he retired from Brondesbury at the age of sixty. He then served as a full-time <i>dayan</i> until 1945.<br>
<br>From 1946 to 1948 Lazarus was recalled from retirement to the post of deputy chief rabbi, after the death of J. H. Hertz. He stood firm against recognition of the legitimacy of Liberal Judaism that was then seeking the right of its synagogues to appoint marriage secretaries and conduct weddings approved by the registrar-general. Under civil law such rights were conferred following certification by the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews in consultation with his (exclusively Orthodox) &#145;ecclesiastical authorities&#146;, namely the <i>haham</i> (chief rabbi) of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation and the chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations, on whose <i>bet din</i> Lazarus served. No compromise was possible, even after Lazarus's departure from office, and in 1949 the Liberals left the board. They eventually (in 1958) had recourse to parliament in order to redress their grievances.<br>
<br>Lazarus collaborated on the Soncino Press translation of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> and translated some previously unpublished poems by the medieval Spanish Hebrew poet Solomon Ibn Gabirol (1906). His most widely read work was a traditionalist handbook for Jewish women entitled <span class="italic">The Ways of her Household</span> (1923). He died at his home, 33 Cholmley Gardens, West Hampstead, on 25 February 1962 and was buried the following day at Willesden Jewish (United) cemetery, next to his wife, who had predeceased him by a dozen years.<br>
