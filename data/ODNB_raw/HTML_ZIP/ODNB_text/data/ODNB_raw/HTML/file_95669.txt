<span class="headword">Roman officers and their wives at Vindolanda</span>  (<em>act. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97&#150;105) were <span class="occ">occupants of a Roman fort that was built at what is now Chesterholm, Northumberland</span>, in the 80s of the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span> and was occupied by successive garrisons until the end of Roman rule in Britain. Details of their lives are recorded on a large number of wooden &#145;tablets&#146; that were discovered there from 1973 onwards by the Vindolanda Trust, led by Robin Birley. Almost all the tablets, which are now in the keeping of the British Museum, come from the earliest levels, between about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 85 and 125. A particularly large group comes from the <i>praetorium</i> (commanding officer's house) of the ninth cohort of Batavians, raised in what is now the Netherlands, and in garrison during the years <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 92&#150;105. Two of its successive prefects (commanders), <a name="cosubject_96887"></a><span class="headword">Flavius Genialis</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97&#150;105)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_96885"></a><span class="headword">Flavius Cerialis</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97&#150;105)<span class="occ"></span>, are well attested by documents and personal letters. Both were probably from the Batavian aristocracy, from which, Tacitus records, commanders were still chosen for the regiments they provided for Rome. Also recorded are many soldiers from the regiment as well as slaves and freedmen from the prefects' households. Several tablets also record Cerialis's wife, <a name="cosubject_96888"></a><span class="headword">Sulpicia Lepidina</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97&#150;105)<span class="occ"></span>, and the couple's close friends, <a name="cosubject_96886"></a><span class="headword">Aelius Brocchus</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97&#150;105)<span class="occ"></span>, a fellow officer stationed elsewhere in the frontier region, and his wife, <a name="cosubject_95669"></a><span class="headword">Claudia Severa</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97&#150;105)<span class="occ"></span>. Genialis and his freedman Gentilis may be attested by a tombstone at Rome, and Brocchus is otherwise known from an altar he dedicated to Diana when serving in Pannonia (modern Hungary). A few more correspondents or persons named in letters are known from other evidence. But Cerialis, Lepidina, and Severa, and most of the other persons in the tablets, are known only from this evidence, which gives snapshots of life at Vindolanda for a few years from about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97 to 105.<h2>
<a name="Twoprefectsandtheirresponsibilities"></a>Two prefects and their responsibilities</h2>The most interesting letter to Genialis is from Haterius Nepos, a fellow officer, who wrote that he was expecting to see him at Coria (Corbridge). Haterius, who twenty years later became prefect (governor) of Egypt, is known from an inscription in Italy to have conducted a census of the Britons of Annandale in southern Scotland about the time he wrote to Genialis. Other letters to Genialis are fragmentary. One unknown correspondent declined an invitation, &#145;for I am very painfully affected by a headache&#146;. Another wrote that &#145;if there is anything you believe might be useful to me, either send it or keep it on one side. As to what we need, I have sent word to you through our Paternus and Gavo.&#146; Gavo, perhaps a Briton, occurs in two tablets as a civilian supplier. Genialis's slave Candidus had a letter from a friend &#145;regarding the Saturnalia costs&#146;; his freedman Gentilis was also at Vindolanda. After handing over to Cerialis, Genialis wrote to him: &#145;I am indicting &hellip; seven men before you or Genitor, because it is in your power to release them.&#146; He was evidently nervous about one man: &#145;because I once did something mean to him, I have been until now &#147;lingering in the thickets&#148;, to be safer there if you send him back&#146;.<br>
<br>Two sets of tablets derive from Cerialis's routine duties. There are several dozen reports called <i>renuntia</i>, with a standard laconic formula: day and month (but not year), then: &#145;<i>Renuntium</i> of the ninth cohort of Batavians. All at their places who ought to be, and the equipment. The <i>optiones</i> [deputy centurions] and curators reported.&#146; Finally it registered who delivered the report; in the only complete example this was &#145;Arcuittius, <i>optio</i> of the century of Crescens&#146;. A single <i>renuntium</i> noted that someone was absent, a man &#145;from the century of Exomnius&#146;, clearly without leave&#151;for which application had to be made to the prefect. A batch of requests survives. After giving their name and century, each man writes: &#145;I ask you, Lord Cerialis, that you hold me worthy for you to grant me leave.&#146; Three men state where they want to go: two to Coria, one to the unidentified Ulucium. One Buccus adds why he wants leave, at Coria: &#145;so that I can buy&#146; something.<br>
<br>A more elaborate letter to the prefect came from Masclus, an outstationed <i>decurio</i> (cavalry troop commander). Addressing Cerialis as &#145;his king&#146;, a form of flattery applied by poets to patrons&#151;although perhaps Cerialis, like some earlier prefects of Batavians, was truly &#145;of royal stock&#146;&#151;he asked &#145;whether the whole detachment should return or just half of it&#146;; and wishes that Cerialis &#145;may be very happy and propitious to me&#146;. A postscript reveals his real motive for writing: &#145;the comrades have no beer, which I ask that you order to be sent.&#146;<br>
<br>Cerialis had to keep his soldiers provisioned. Several tablets refer to corn, both wheat and barley, being delivered; on one Masclus is named as bringing wheat both in June and September. The regiment had its own pigs, looked after by Candidus; and Atrectus &#145;the brewer&#146; probably made beer in the Batavians' own brewery. Cerialis also had to organize working parties. One tablet records thirty <i>structores</i>, sent to &#145;build the guest-house&#146; (<i>hospiti[u]m</i>), accompanied &#145;by the <i>medicus</i> Marcus&#146;, a precaution in case any sustained injury; it also refers to men &#145;burning stone&#146;, to produce lime for mortar, and to a third group preparing clay for &#145;the fort's wattle-fences&#146;. Another tablet registers &#145;343 men in the workshops&#146;, whose occupations and employment included: leather workers or shoemakers; &#145;builders at the bath-house&#146;; working lead; &#145;at the hospital&#146; (<i>valetudinarium</i>); &#145;at the kilns&#146;; digging clay; plastering; making tents; and preparing rubble.<h2>
<a name="Glimpsesofprivatelife"></a>Glimpses of private life</h2>Cerialis's private correspondence includes his own drafts. In one such, carefully composed, with words crossed out and others substituted, he sought to influence appointments. After some flattering remarks, he asks his correspondent Crispinus to greet the governor, &#145;Marcellus, my consular&#146;, then makes an elaborate request. This he then summed up: &#145;fulfil whatever I await from you and set me up with very many friends so that I can enjoy a pleasant military service. I write this to you from Vindolanda &hellip; [my] winter-quarters.&#146; Other letters and documents show how important friends were to him. Eight pages cover <i>expensa</i>, mainly for entertaining, over several years, starting about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 101 (the consuls for 103 and 104, perhaps for 102 as well, are registered). An early entry has: &#145;at dinner, Niger and Brocchus&#146;. These two had written jointly to Cerialis, probably just before their visit; a postscript says &#145;expect us&#146;. Brocchus is registered as a guest in three subsequent entries. On most occasions chicken or geese were eaten. One Sautenus, perhaps the regimental poultryman&#151;one entry refers to him <i>in stabul&oacute;</i>, &#145;in the poultry-yard&#146;&#151;is mentioned several times. After a meal &#145;at Sautenus's place&#146;, costs were summarized, then the numbers of geese (and probably chickens) still available entered. One of the latest entries registers &#145;the arrival of the governor&#146;, when various items &#145;were consumed at lunch&#146;.<br>
<br>A different tablet lists barley, beer, wine and vinegar, pork fat, and fish sauce, consumed between 19 and 25 June. On 24 June the &#145;lord&#146; (<i>dominus</i>), &#145;through Privatus&#146;, probably a slave, donated wine for &#145;the festival of the goddess&#146;, presumably Fortuna, whose feast day it was. Cerialis himself and his wife were away: &#145;the <i>domini</i> [the lord and his lady] have remained at Briga&#146;, surely staying with Brocchus and Severa, for Briga, perhaps Kirkbride near the Solway coast, seems to have been Brocchus's base. The place also occurs in a letter from Severa to Lepidina. First she expressed the hope that she can visit:<blockquote>I, sister, just as I promised that I would ask Brocchus, and that I would come to you&#151;I did ask him, and he replied that it is always permitted to me &hellip; to come to you in whatsoever way I can.</blockquote>But, after a gap in the text, in which she perhaps indicated that she might not manage it, she concluded: &#145;I shall remain at Briga. Farewell, dearest sister and most longed for soul.&#146; She herself invited Lepidina to visit her on a special occasion:<blockquote>I ask you warmly to come to us on 11 September, sister, to celebrate my birthday, you will make the day more enjoyable by your presence. Greet your Cerialis. My Aelius and our little son greet you. Farewell, sister, dearest soul, as I hope to prosper, and hail.</blockquote>The main part of Severa's letters were clearly dictated, written by a scribe; she added the tender greetings in her own inelegant hand.<br>
<br>On one occasion Brocchus invited Cerialis to &#145;come with your Lepidina, to stay with us beyond the new year&#146;. Cerialis was a passionate hunter, as Brocchus clearly was too: his altar in Pannonia to the goddess of hunting confirms this. A draft letter to him from Cerialis begins: &#145;If you love me, brother, I ask that you send me hunting-nets.&#146; In another draft letter Cerialis refers both to &#145;my huntsmen&#146; and to &#145;Brocchus having returned&#146;. A list names two breeds of hunting dog, <i>vertragi</i> and <i>segosi</i>, and another tablet mentions repair of dog-collars. It was presumably when the Batavians left Vindolanda that a list was compiled of &#145;the nets that we have left behind&#146;: one for thrushes, one for duck, together with three snares to catch swans, and a fishing net. Seven further snares were left &#145;with a veteran&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Womenandchildren"></a>Women and children</h2>Brocchus sent Cerialis other items too: a &#145;delivery note&#146; lists clothing &#145;from Brocchus&#146;, including &#145;dining-tunics&#146;. No clothes for Lepidina seem to be named, but her footwear has been found in the <i>praetorium</i>, notably a stylish sandal, size 33, decorated with rosettes and stamped with the maker's name. It was surely Lepidina who wore a round cap woven from hair moss stems, no doubt to repel insects. Like Brocchus and Severa, Cerialis and Lepidina had offspring with them: shoes found in the <i>praetorium</i> were suitable for children between two and ten&#151;of course, the varying sizes may belong to one or two growing boys from the four years or so that their parents were there. A line from Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> (9.473), written in clumsy capitals on the back of a draft letter, was probably a child's writing exercise; <i>segn</i>, in normal handwriting, which follows, is no doubt the comment, <i>segn[iter]</i>, &#145;slack&#146;, by a tutor, a slave, or freedman. Two further tablets with Virgilian quotations, one the first line of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, the other a famous quotation about the golden age from the <span class="italic">Georgics</span> (1.125), were written by adults.<br>
<br>Lepidina evidently had her own slave girls. A letter from a woman correspondent may concern new ones: &#145;So may I be in good health, lady, to bring you two slave-girls [?], one &hellip; the other free from fever [?].&#146; A fragment, probably written by one female slave to another, ends with greetings for &#145;our two girls&#146;. A letter from Cerialis himself to his household stresses that &#145;if any friends should have come&#146; in his absence, &#145;you should all make sure they are well received&#146;. He mentions &#145;two chickens&#146; and &#145;wine&#146;, and adds that, &#145;after the lunch-guests have been sent on their way, you should hurry to Coria in the four-wheeler&#146;.<br>
<br>An inventory gives insight into Lepidina's kitchen: &#145;two shallow dishes; five side-plates; three vinegar-bowls; three egg-containers; on the cross-beam, a platter; a shallow dish; a container; a bronze lamp; four bread-baskets; two cups; in a box, two ladles&#146;. A list of provisions has spices, roe-deer, salt, young pig, ham, wheat, and red deer, while, on another tablet, &#145;ordered through Adiutor from London&#146; were a set of cooking bowls, mustard, anise, caraway, and thyme. A lengthy invoice, with prices per item, lists &#145;two locks, six cloaks with buckles, five headbands, nine pounds of hair, ten loin-cloths, a saddle, fifteen cloaks made of bark [?], ten bags, three sets of skillets, two sets of reins&#146;, and, most expensive of all, &#145;five curtains, one scarlet, one green, two purple, and one yellow&#146;.<br>
<br>Soon after Cerialis entertained the governor to lunch, the ninth Batavians left Vindolanda: they were transferred to the continent as part of a set of troop movements to reinforce the expeditionary army of the emperor Trajan in the Second Dacian War, which opened in June <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 105. The Batavians were to end up in Raetia (modern Bavaria) at a fort that took their name, Batava Castra (Passau). Whether Cerialis continued to command them is at present unknown. He may have retired from the service after leaving Vindolanda.<br>
<br>The Vindolanda tablets have been described (in the magazine <span class="italic">Current Archaeology</span>) as &#145;probably the most important&#151;and certainly the most dramatic&#151;discoveries made in Roman Britain in the twentieth century&#146;; in 2003 experts at the British Museum voted the tablets the &#145;top treasure&#146; in the museum for a special edition of BBC Television's <span class="italic">Meet the Ancestors</span>. Of the initial finds of the 1970s the writing materials were particularly striking. As well as the well-known thicker tablets on which wax had been spread, to be incised with a metal stilus (of which the scratched traces can seldom be read), at Vindolanda hundreds of &#145;leaf tablets&#146; were also found. These thin, carefully prepared slivers of wood, written on with ink, are of a kind hitherto scarcely known. It had not previously been realized that this cheap substitute for papyrus had been in regular use for letters, accounts, and daily records, at least in the north-western part of the Roman empire. In the later 1980s, after more tablets had been excavated, their full significance became apparent. They supply detailed evidence for an otherwise very badly recorded period, between the recall of the governor Julius Agricola in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 84 and the building of Hadrian's Wall, begun in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 122. More important is that they illuminate many aspects of Roman military life, such as the supply of food and other goods and the associated record keeping, internal routine, social activity&#151;including the presence of officers' wives and other women&#151;hunting, relations with Britons, and literacy. Further, they offer valuable information about the Latin language and Roman handwriting. Several hundred individuals are recorded by name. A handful of these crop up repeatedly in both letters and documents, so that at least for a small group one has a biographical &#145;snapshot&#146; for which there is as yet no parallel from the Roman period in Britain. All books on Roman Britain published since the 1980s and many dealing with other aspects of Roman history now refer to the Vindolanda evidence.<br>
