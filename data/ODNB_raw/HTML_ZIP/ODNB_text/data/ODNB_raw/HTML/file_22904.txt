<span class="headword">Pursglove,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Silvester]</span>  (1503/4&#150;1580), <span class="occ">prior of Guisborough and bishop-suffragan of Hull</span>, was the son of Adam and Mudwina Pursglove of Tideswell in the Peak District of Derbyshire; he was said to be forty-four years old in 1548. His mother dispatched her son at a young age to her brother, William Bradshawe, a London merchant who lived in the parish of St Michael, Cornhill. Bradshawe placed his nephew at St Paul's School, founded by Dean Colet in 1509, where he was one of the earliest pupils of William Lily, the first headmaster. After studying at St Paul's for nine years Pursglove entered the neighbouring Augustinian priory of St Mary Overie, which after a short time sent him to continue his humanist education at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He remained at the university for fourteen years.<br>
<br>Until the mid-1530s Pursglove (who on entering religion had taken the name Silvester) had not been directly involved in religious politics but in 1536 everything changed. In February of that year Cromwell's officials visited Guisborough Priory, the richest Augustinian house in the north of England, where they discovered sufficient evidence of immorality to justify the enforced resignation of the prior, James Cockerill. As his replacement Cromwell imposed Pursglove upon the community, which had no choice but to elect him prior on 25 April 1536, when his disgruntled predecessor retired to a mansion in Guisborough called Bishop's Place. During the Pilgrimage of Grace Sir Francis Bigod attempted to restore Cockerill, who publicly commended Bigod's book condemning the royal supremacy. In December Pursglove was very concerned about discontent among his canons, but he succeeded in retaining control, and Cockerill's subsequent imprisonment in London on a charge of treason in the spring of 1537 removed his chief opponent from the scene.<br>
<br>Used by Cromwell in 1538 to oversee the election of a candidate acceptable to the government as abbot of Whitby, Pursglove accepted Archbishop Lee's nomination to become suffragan bishop of Hull in 1538 only after he had secured the vicegerent's approval. In 1539 and 1540 he was particularly active in conducting ordination ceremonies, mainly at York Minster, but on two occasions in September and December 1539 in Guisborough Priory church. On 1 October 1538 he was also collated to the prebend of Langtoft in York Minster, which he exchanged for the more valuable prebend of Wistow on 2 May 1541.<br>
<br>By the autumn of 1539 Pursglove must have realized that the dissolution of his priory could no longer be delayed. On 22 December 1539 he and his convent surrendered Guisborough Priory, one of the last of the Yorkshire monasteries to be suppressed, receiving the very large sum of &pound;166 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. as his pension. Pursglove also accumulated a considerable amount of church preferment at this period. On 26 June 1544 he became provost of Jesus College, Rotherham, and held this office until the suppression of the college at the beginning of Edward VI's reign. In 1548, besides his stipend of &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. and other perquisites as provost, he was reported to have his pension of 250 marks and a prebend in York Minster worth &pound;58 a year. In September 1549 he acquired the living of his home village of Tideswell, and on 29 January 1550 he was installed archdeacon of Nottingham in succession to Cuthbert Marshall.<br>
<br>Pursglove's tenure of the bishopric of Hull continued without interruption during the protestant regime of Archbishop Holgate and the Catholic restoration of Archbishop Heath, the successors of Archbishop Lee. As a former Augustinian canon he was reconciled to the Catholic church on 18 March 1555, and in September 1558 received the prebend of Oxton in Southwell Minster. In 1559, however, he felt called to make a stand, and lost all his offices for refusing to take the oath of supremacy. Commissioners in 1561 informed the privy council that he was &#145;very wealthy, stiff in papistry and of estimation in the country&#146;, and confined him to within a 20 mile radius of his manor house at Ugthorpe near Whitby  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 521).<br>
<br>In November 1559, the year of his deprivation, Pursglove obtained letters patent from Elizabeth to found a grammar school at Tideswell, dedicated to the child Jesus, with lands to the yearly value of &pound;20. Some of his statutes contain provisions resembling those devised by Colet for St Paul's. Then on 5 June 1563 he gained permission from the crown to found a similar school, bearing the same name, and also a hospital, or almshouse, for six poor men and six poor women at Guisborough. In his deed of foundation, probably in his own hand, dated 11 August 1563, he placed both institutions under the visitatorial power of the archbishop of York.<br>
<br>Pursglove lived in his last years partly at Tideswell and partly at Dunston in Derbyshire, from which he made a number of further donations to his school and hospital at Guisborough, including a gift of Greek grammars, the works of Plutarch, Sallust, Cicero, Horace, Ovid, Juvenal, and Erasmus, and other books for the school library. He made his will on 31 March 1580, setting aside the huge sum of &pound;40 to be distributed to the poor at his funeral. He left his plate, his half year's pension from Guisborough due at Lady day, and most of the rest of his possessions to various members of the Eyre family of Dunston, into which his sister Alice Pursglove had married. He died on 2 May 1580 and was buried in Tideswell church, where a fine brass of a bishop in eucharistic vestments (noteworthy as one of the last of its kind), together with a long verse inscription, marks his resting place.<br>
