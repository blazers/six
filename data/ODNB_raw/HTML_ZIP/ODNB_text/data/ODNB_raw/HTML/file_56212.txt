<span class="headword">Topham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hillier]</span>,  Mirabel Dorothy</span>  (1891&#150;1980), <span class="occ">racecourse owner</span>, daughter of Henry Hope Hillier, a licensed victualler, and his wife, Nellie, was born on 14 August 1891 at the Baron's Court Hotel, Connaught Road, Fulham, London, which her father ran. There Mirabel spent her childhood. Henry Hillier later became manager of the Haymarket Theatre, where Mirabel went on stage as Hope Hillier, a gaiety girl. She appeared in several West End productions.<br>
<br>This career wound up in 1922, when on 19 April Mirabel Hillier married Arthur Ronald Topham (<i>b</i>. 1885/6), a leading member of the family which had long run Aintree racecourse near Liverpool. In 1935 she was elected to the board of the family company, Topham Ltd, which ran Aintree. Three years later she became managing director of the company, and in her attempts over the next three decades to make Aintree financially viable, displayed immense enthusiasm and real business skill. Taking an immense pride in staging the Grand National, the world's greatest steeplechase, she purchased the freehold of the 270 acre racecourse from Lord Sefton in 1949 for &pound;275,000. Mirabel Topham then restored a derelict cottage on the course and lived there in what she subsequently described as her &#145;padlocked house&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 June 1980).<br>
<br>Unfortunately, a significant decline in attendances at the hurdle and flat races at Aintree, caused in large part by the emergence of television as a medium for popular entertainment, put the future of the racecourse in jeopardy. In a bid to generate new income Mirabel Topham devised new attractions, including the opening of a motor-racing circuit. This allowed the European grand prix to be staged there in 1954.<br>
<br>Mirabel Topham learned to negotiate quickly and effectively with a wide range of individuals and groups, including stable lads, trainers, accountants, and bookmakers. A redoubtable person, she gained a reputation as a no-nonsense woman. In her business dealings she did not suffer gladly those whom she perceived as fools or opportunists. A number of outside trainers were known to harbour resentment towards her, and she was occasionally in dispute with the Jockey Club. She could be tough where corporate interests were concerned. Mirabel Topham caused a number of newspaper headlines over her attacks on commentary rights and lack of television revenue from the BBC. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, moreover, as attendances at Aintree fell, she reduced its racing calendar, so that by the early 1970s Aintree was reduced to a single annual three-day meeting, the highlight of which was the Grand National. As a number of obituaries later put it, Mirabel Topham found the Aintree going heavy.<br>
<br>Mirabel Topham's combative spirit inevitably made her a public figure, and the battles in which she engaged &#145;gave the public a picture of a tough, unapproachable and obstinate impresario&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 June 1980). Yet that was far from being the whole picture, and friends and family remarked that she possessed &#145;an engaging charm and a sense of humour&#146;  (ibid.). In addition Mirabel Topham could never be called a philistine: she was a patron of the arts, and a generous benefactor of the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. She initiated an annual competition from 1949 for the design and manufacture of a trophy for the Topham Trophy steeplechase, a race held during the Grand National meeting.<br>
<br>From at least the early 1960s Mirabel Topham was involved in attempts to sell the racecourse. In 1964 Lord Sefton took legal action against her sale of the land for residential purposes (on the grounds of a restrictive covenant in the 1949 agreement). Mirabel Topham finally won the action, after the House of Lords ruled in her favour; but the sale fell through. Mirabel Topham's reign at Aintree finally ended in 1973, when the course was purchased by the Merseyside property dealer and prominent member of the turf, William Davies, for an estimated &pound;3 million. In retirement Mirabel Topham lived at her beloved Paddock Lodge home at Aintree. She also had a house at 18 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London.<br>
<br>Mirabel Topham died of cancer, aged eighty-eight, on 29 May 1980 in Paddock Lodge. She was buried in the family vault in north Wales. Although Mirabel Topham had no children of her own, she adopted a cousin's children, Patricia and James Bidwell; they inherited most of her estate. In a long and appreciative obituary, <span class="italic">The Times</span> described Mirabel Topham as one of the turf's most forceful and controversial personalities. &#145;Mrs Topham will be remembered&#146;, it added, &#145;as a large, formidable figure of eighteen stone, dressed in tweeds and prepared to stand firmly by decisions, however unpopular. She enjoyed the scent of battle and was always ready to champion David against Goliath&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 June 1980).<br>
