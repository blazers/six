<span class="headword">King,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jacob Rey]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1753&#150;1823), <span class="occ">moneylender and radical</span>, was born in London, the son of Moses Rey, a Jewish street trader of Gibraltarian or north African origin; he was named Jacob. He was educated at the charity school of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews and then, in 1771, apprenticed by the school to a Jewish merchant house in the City of London. After leaving school he Anglicized his name to John King; later, when famous, he was known as Jew King. After completing his apprenticeship he served in an attorney's office for a short period; soon thereafter he ventured forth as a moneylender, a trade at which he was an almost immediate success, as witnessed by the fact that in 1775 he donated &pound;100 to the charity school, in gratitude for his education, and by his marriage the following year to Sara, the daughter of Benjamin Nunes Lara, a City merchant. Their children included the writers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63521/', "Sophia Fortnum")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63519/', "Charlotte Byrne")</script>, as well as Charles King, who later took over his father's business interests.<br>
<br>Although usually described as a moneylender King was, more precisely, a money broker&#151;a middleman who negotiated loans with funds supplied by persons who desired a high return on their money but wished to avoid the notoriety associated with moneylending. His clients included noble gamblers and profligates (Lord Byron among them) as well as more humble persons unable to live within their means. In 1806 he raised money for the millenarian prophetess Joanna Southcott, who, it was revealed in court proceedings the following year, had no intention of repaying him since she expected the millennium to arrive first. In the pursuit of well-born clients King entertained lavishly and frequently. In cultivating these contacts his long-term liaison with Jane Isabella Butler, the widowed countess of Lanesborough (1737&#150;1828), was of great assistance. They met in 1783 and a year later King divorced his wife before a rabbinical court in Leghorn, Italy, where he had fled to escape imprisonment. The couple married on 4 January 1790 at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury. In addition to his loan activities, to which there was often a criminal dimension, King was linked to various other frauds and swindles and was frequently before the courts. From 1805 to 1811, for example, he headed a group of former Jacobins who extorted money from members of the royal family, the prime minister, government officials, and other notables.<br>
<br>While pursuing these unsavoury activities King also took part in the anti-ministerial reform agitation of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Indeed he was one of the first Jews anywhere in Europe to participate in politics in pursuit of goals unrelated to matters of Jewish status. As a youth he met and was influenced by Tom Paine, and from the early 1780s (except for a brief period in the 1790s) championed reform causes. In 1783 he published an indictment of ministerial policy, <span class="italic">Thoughts on the difficulties and distresses in which the peace of 1783 has involved the people of England</span>. In the 1790s he was close to leaders of the London Corresponding Society and contributed to their defence when they were tried for high treason in 1794. He edited or wrote for several radical newspapers, including <span class="italic">The Argus</span> and the <span class="italic">British Guardian</span>, and participated in most of the radical campaigns of 1802&#150;15, especially the 1808&#150;9 attack on the duke of York for allowing his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke, to sell military preferments.<br>
<br>For most of his adult life King was alienated from Judaism, even claiming in court in 1795 that he had been a member of the Church of England all his adult life. But there is no evidence that he converted to Christianity, even though he lived almost exclusively among Christians and not Jews. Then in the late 1790s he reversed course and began to re-embrace his Jewish identity, eventually becoming a spirited defender of his ancestral faith. He capped his return to Judaism with the publication, in 1817, of a new edition of David Levi's apologia <span class="italic">Dissertations on the Prophecies of the Old Testament</span>, which was first published between 1793 and 1800; in his introduction King offered a surprisingly traditional defence of rabbinic Judaism. In August 1823 he died and was buried in Florence, where he and Lady Lanesborough had lived since about 1817.<br>
