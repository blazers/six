<span class="headword">Buxton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jebb]</span>,  Dorothy Frances</span>  (1881&#150;1963), <span class="occ">humanitarian and social activist</span>, was born on 3 March 1881 at The Lyth, Ellesmere, Shropshire, the youngest daughter of Arthur Trevor Jebb (1839&#150;1894), barrister and philanthropic squire, and his wife, Eglantyne Louisa Jebb (1845&#150;1925), community worker and poet, the sister of Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb MP, regius professor of Greek at Cambridge. Louisa [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50178/', "Wilkins, Louisa")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34165/', "Eglantyne Jebb")</script> were her elder sisters. She was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge (1900&#150;04). On 11 August 1904 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74568/', "Charles Roden Buxton (1875&#150;1942)")</script>, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32225/', "Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, third baronet")</script>. The young couple deliberately set up house in the poor London district of Kennington to share those hardships they dedicated themselves as radicals to relieve, if not abolish. Charles Buxton was an educationist with political ambitions to reform the country via parliament; Dorothy was a high-minded social activist, a latter-day Dorothea Brooke, one, in Keats's words:<blockquote>
<div>to whom the miseries of the world<br>
</div>
<div>Are misery and will not let them rest.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In 1916 she joined both the Independent Labour Party and the Society of Friends.<br>
<br>When the First World War broke out with its concomitant propaganda war Dorothy Buxton could not bear the dehumanization of the German people in the British press which she knew would only worsen and prolong the war and make an eventual genuine peace settlement impossible. She determined to bring before English readers evidence of the fellow humanity of &#145;the enemy&#146; and, in particular, evidence of the opposition to German chauvinism and militaristic imperialism within Germany. Therefore she set herself to translate and publish in leaflet form extracts from the foreign press, including twenty-five enemy papers which the Board of Trade allowed her to import from Scandinavia&#151;the board was perhaps not unwilling to have such &#145;intelligence&#146; work done for it voluntarily. She was then invited by C. K. Ogden to publish her unpopular but influential &#145;Notes from the foreign press&#146; in his weekly <span class="italic">Cambridge Magazine</span>, which she did from October 1915 to early 1920. She published the news of German socialist anti-war demonstrations and the evidence that the British hardline position on the destruction of Germany only increased support for that country's intransigent military leadership. To translate from French, German, Italian, Russian, Hungarian, Romanian, and Finnish&#151;100 newspapers in all&#151;required a team of scores of expert linguists and translators and shorthand typists, not to mention specialists in foreign affairs; all of the work was supervised and edited by Dorothy Buxton in her own home, which was turned into the daily headquarters. Although she then had two young children, her &#145;austerity impelled her to make a sacrifice of home-life itself&#146;  (Bunsen, 49).<br>
<br>From 1917 Dorothy Buxton received and disseminated the news of appalling privation in Germany. So intolerable did she consider the starving of Germans and Austrians by the allied blockade, even after they had surrendered, that she and her sister Eglantyne, together with Lord Parmoor, Kate Courtney, and Marian Ellis, co-founded the Fight the Famine Committee in 1919 to change that retributive economic policy. Out of the committee came the founding of the international Save the Children Fund.<br>
<br>Dorothy Buxton continued to be a humanitarian activist all her life. During the 1930s she collected and circulated reports on Nazi concentration camps that she had received from the refugees she was aiding, only to have them pigeon-holed by the Foreign Office until after the Second World War had broken out and they were inefficacious. Her husband's peace witness made him an appeaser of Germany's claims to right the wrongs of the treaty of Versailles. But Dorothy insisted on publicizing Nazi atrocities; she even made a quixotic attempt to see Goering in 1935 to confront him with the abominations being perpetrated and so shame him out of his Nazism. He of course only started shouting at her in fury. Both before and during the Second World War she made contact with the Bekennende Kirche&#151;the underground protestant anti-Nazi Christians in Germany, including Bonhoeffer&#151;once again publicizing the existence of humane Germans for British readers. She died, twenty years after her husband, at her home, Whingate, Peaslake, near Guildford, Surrey, on 8 April 1963.<br>
