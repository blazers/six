<span class="headword">Steele, Sir  Thomas Montague</span>  (1820&#150;1890), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 11 May 1820 in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, the eldest son of Major-General Thomas Steele, of Guilsborough, and Elizabeth Montagu, second daughter of the fifth duke of Manchester. After Sandhurst he was commissioned ensign in the 64th foot on 10 January 1838. He exchanged into the Coldstream Guards on 20 July, became lieutenant and captain on 29 March 1844, and captain and lieutenant-colonel on 31 October 1851. From 25 July 1842 to 23 February 1848 he was aide-de-camp to the governor of Madras. He was appointed military secretary to Lord Raglan on 23 February 1854, and (with the exception of one month, 5 July to 6 August 1855, during which he was assistant adjutant-general) he held that appointment under Raglan and his successor until 16 November 1855. He was at the Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and at the fall of Sevastopol, and was mentioned in dispatches. Made brevet colonel on 28 November 1854 and CB on 5 July 1855, he received the Mejidiye (third class), the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (fifth class), and the order of St Maurice and St Lazarus (second class). He was also made aide-de-camp to the queen on 29 June 1855. In 1856 he married Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of E. M. Fitzgerald, and in 1865 married his second wife, Rosalie Malvina, daughter of T. M'Carthy of New York. Steele became major in his regiment on 13 December 1860, and lieutenant-colonel on 8 November 1862. He retired from it to half pay on 24 November 1863, and was promoted major-general on 17 August 1865. He commanded the troops in the Dublin district from 1 April 1872 to 31 March 1874. On 7 January 1874 he became lieutenant-general, and on 23 September he was given the colonelcy of the Gloucestershire regiment. He commanded the division at Aldershot from 14 April 1875 to 30 June 1880, becoming full general on 1 October 1877, and from 1 October 1880 he commanded the forces in Ireland for five years. On 11 May 1887 he was retired. He was made KCB on 20 May 1871 and GCB on 21 June 1887, and was made colonel of the Coldstream Guards on 7 August 1884. He died at his home, Frimley Park, Farnborough, on 25 February 1890; his second wife survived him.<br>
