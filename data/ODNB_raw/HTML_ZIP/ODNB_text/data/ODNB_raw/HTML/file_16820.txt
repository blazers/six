<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Charles</span>  (1748&#150;1828), <span class="occ">banker and philanthropist</span>, was born in Edgbaston Street, Birmingham, on 22 August 1748, the second son of Sampson Lloyd (1727&#150;1807) of Birmingham, iron manufacturer and banker and a member of the Society of Friends, and his second wife, Rachel (1712&#150;1756), daughter of Nehemiah Champion of Bristol. He was at a school in Worcester run by a member of the society, Ephraim Goodere, and then entered the family manufacturing and banking business. His chief, and eventually only, concern was banking, as a partner in Taylors and Lloyds Bank (a forerunner of Lloyds Bank). On 13 May 1774 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1821), daughter of James Farmer of Birmingham, with whom he had fifteen children. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16823/', "Charles Lloyd (1775&#150;1839)")</script>, was a poet associated with Samuel Taylor Coleridge and with Charles Lamb.<br>
<br>Though his principles as a member of the Society of Friends debarred him from holding public office Lloyd was active in public activities in Birmingham, was a member of the board of commissioners, then responsible for local government, and helped to found the Birmingham General Hospital, where he served as treasurer for fifty years. In a wider field he went to London in 1775 to meet Benjamin Franklin, in the vain hope of persuading him to avoid war, and was actively concerned with the campaign to abolish the slave trade, his brother John Lloyd being a founder member of the Abolition Committee.<br>
<br>Having studied the classics, in his spare time Lloyd composed verse translations of Homer and Horace, some of which were published. Inspired by Virgil's <span class="italic">Georgics</span> he bought a farm at Olton, just outside Birmingham, and for thirty years he devoted one day a week to farming, which &#145;contributed, in conjunction with temperance and cheerfulness, to keep a naturally delicate constitution in health and vigour to a late period of his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). He died on 16 January 1828 at his residence, Bingley House, Birmingham, and was buried at the Quaker burial-ground at Bull Lane in the city.<br>
