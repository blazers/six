<span class="headword">Maxwell,  William Hamilton</span>  (1791&#150;1850), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Newry, co. Down, on 30 June 1791, the son of James Maxwell, a merchant, and his wife, a daughter of William Hamilton, of a good, respected family. He went to school at Dr Henderson's academy in Hill Street, Newry. On 7 December 1807, when he was only fifteen years old, he entered Trinity College, Dublin. Although he wasted a good deal of time there, he graduated with some distinction as a BA in 1812.<br>
<br>It is difficult to establish the events of Maxwell's life in his early manhood. He was keen to follow a military career but this ambition was strongly opposed by his family, who wanted him to enter the church or the legal profession. As these arguments persisted, he spent his time in his favourite pursuits of hunting, shooting, and fishing, though he also read military history, poetry, and romances. All these activities provided him with material for his writing in subsequent years. It is sometimes said that he joined the army during this period of his life. The writer of his obituary in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (25 January 1851, 51) claimed that he attained the rank of captain in the 88th regiment, that he participated in the last stages of the Peninsular War, and that he was present at the battle of Waterloo.  But this claim is untrue, and it is possible that he gained his knowledge of recent military campaigns from talking and drinking with officers of regiments successively stationed in co. Mayo. As a young man he spent lavishly, anticipating his future income by confirming for ready money certain leases which his father had granted to tenants and by expecting to inherit money from an aunt. When the latter funds failed to materialize because of legal difficulties, he thought of taking a military commission in South America, but this plan came to nothing.<br>
<br>Finally, in accordance with his family's wishes, Maxwell took holy orders. He was ordained deacon at Carlow on 25 July 1813 and became a curate at Clonallan in the same year. In 1817 he married Mary Dobbin (<i>b</i>. 1796), the second daughter of Thomas Dobbin, JP for co. Armagh. In 1820 the archbishop of Armagh, who was friendly with his wife's family, appointed him to two benefices in the area of Ballagh, Connemara, a place destitute of a congregation but abounding in game, and therefore a situation congenial to Maxwell. While living in a shooting lodge at Ballycroy he wrote his first novel, <span class="italic">O'Hara, or, 1798</span>, which was published anonymously in 1825 but which was unsuccessful. He seems once again to have become unsettled, but the marquess of Sligo, with whom he was on friendly terms, gave him a house rent-free to retain him at Ballagh.<br>
<br>In 1829 Maxwell achieved recognition as a writer when Henry Colburn published his <span class="italic">Stories of Waterloo</span>, for which he paid him &pound;300. Three years later one of his most popular books appeared: <span class="italic">Wild Sports of the West</span> (1832). This contained lively tales and legends together with colourful descriptions of Irish people, sporting activities (such as salmon fishing and deer hunting), and the Connaught countryside. An edition of this book appeared in 1916 with an appreciative introduction by the earl of Dunraven. Maxwell had thus become a progenitor of two kinds of fiction which became popular in the 1830s and 1840s: the military novel and the rollicking story of Irish life.<br>
<br>Maxwell was over 6 feet tall, distinguished in appearance, and elegantly dressed. In the words of one of his friends, William Maginn, he was &#145;a fine, dashing-looking, long, well-knit fellow&#146;  (Maginn, vii&#150;xii). He was vivacious and an entertaining conversationalist. Sir William Wilde thought that as a raconteur he was second only to Sheridan. Maxwell became friendly with Charles Lever in 1835, encouraging him to write novels of adventure and exchanging with him experiences and stories of Irish life and characters. As a result, it was not always possible to say who was the original author of certain incidents in their books. His easy-going temperament and fluency are reflected in his fiction, which was enthusiastically described by Maginn: &#145;he flings off his tales as they were so many tumblers of punch, hot and strong, pleasant and heart-cheering, hastily mixed, and hastily disposed of&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Maxwell contributed to periodicals, including <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> and the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>. Although Dickens had a poor opinion of some of his contributions to <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, he put a story of Maxwell's (&#145;The Expedition&#146;) in <span class="italic">The Pic-Nic Papers</span> (1841), the compilation he edited to raise money for the widow of John Macrone, the publisher. Maxwell was a prolific writer, producing some twenty books in about twenty years. Most of them were popular, and a staple of the circulating libraries. Typical novels are <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Hector O'Hallaran and his Man, Mark Antony O'Toole</span> (1842&#150;3), illustrated by John Leech, and <span class="italic">Captain O'Sullivan, or, Adventures, Civil, Military and Matrimonial of a Gentleman on Half-Pay</span> (1846), which are picaresque narratives, as their titles indicate. In 1844 he wrote <span class="italic">Wanderings in the Highlands and Islands</span>, a sequel to <span class="italic">Wild Sports of the West</span>. He also wrote non-fiction, including the <span class="italic">Life of Field-Marshal His Grace the Duke of Wellington</span> (1839&#150;41), which reappeared in many later editions, and a <span class="italic">History of the Irish Rebellion in 1798</span> (1845), illustrated by George Cruikshank. <span class="italic">The Irish Movements</span> (1848) was an outspoken attack on Chartism and on Irish campaigns for independence: &#145;Away with agitation: conciliate your best friend, England, if you can.&#146;<br>
<br>According to the records of the Royal Literary Fund, Maxwell was declared bankrupt in 1840 but later paid off these debts. His situation worsened in 1844 when he was apparently deprived of his living for non-residence. By May 1847, when he applied to the fund, he was in the queen's bench prison. After spending several years in ill health and distress, he retired to Inveresk, Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, where he died aged fifty-nine on 28 December 1850. He was buried at the strangers' burial ground on either 29 or 30 December and was survived by his wife and eight dependent, unmarried children, two of whom had been born after June 1847.<br>
