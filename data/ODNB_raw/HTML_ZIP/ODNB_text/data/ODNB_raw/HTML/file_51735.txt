<span class="headword">Heaf,  Frederick Rowland George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Fritz Rudolf Georg Hief]</span>  (1894&#150;1973), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 21 June 1894 at Desborough, Northamptonshire, the son of Julius Rudolf Hief (1860&#150;1941), watchmaker and maker of scientific instruments, who had emigrated to England from Germany in 1881, and married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1896), a schoolteacher, daughter of Thomas Beavon, ironmaster. Heaf was baptized Fritz Rudolf Georg Hief, but changed his name by deed poll in 1916.<br>
<br>Hief was educated from 1907 at Laxton grammar school and from 1911 at Oundle School, and won a foundation scholarship in 1913 to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he gained second-class honours in chemistry, physics, and geology. As a conscientious objector he was exempted from military service in 1915, and joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit; however, he was allowed to return to Cambridge to continue a medical education, with clinical studies at St Thomas's Hospital, and qualified in 1918. A short period of service in the Royal Army Medical Corps took him to north Russia and China. Demobilized in April 1919 he obtained resident appointments at the Brompton Hospital and its sanatorium at Frimley. On 25 October 1920 he married Madeleine (<i>d</i>. 1966), daughter of John Denison of Ilkley, Yorkshire. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In October 1920 Heaf was appointed senior assistant medical officer to the London county council's Colindale Hospital for tuberculosis, and in September 1922 he moved as medical superintendent to the 200 bed King Edward VII Memorial Sanatorium at Warwick. He returned to the service of the London county council in 1930 as medical superintendent at Colindale. His appointment was part of the comprehensive anti-tuberculosis service, which local authorities were required to provide; and in 1937, he moved to central London as medical officer in charge of the service for London.<br>
<br>At this time the control of tuberculosis depended upon early diagnosis, isolation of infective patients, and public education on the avoidance of infection. Treatment involved long periods of rest in specialized institutions followed by rehabilitation and social support for those who responded well. Increasingly, however, active procedures calling for surgical facilities were being used in selected cases. The task of planning and co-ordinating the activities of tuberculosis dispensaries, hospitals, and sanatoria for the entire metropolitan area in this changing situation, with contributions from the voluntary sector, was challenging; in meeting this challenge, Heaf was greatly helped by his clinical knowledge and experience combined with his friendly, unassuming, and quietly authoritative manner; his administrative ability also became evident. This led to his becoming recognized as an expert in every aspect of tuberculosis. He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1946.<br>
<br>Heaf's concern with the problems of ex-servicemen with tuberculosis led to his becoming honorary medical director of the Preston Hall village settlement in 1944. He was active in the affairs of the Tuberculosis Association, of which he was president (1945&#150;9). He was appointed adviser in tuberculosis to the Ministry of Health in 1948 and to the Colonial Office in 1949. In respect of this he was involved in visits to colonies over the next twenty years, and was created CMG in 1956.<br>
<br>In 1949 Heaf was appointed David Davis professor of tuberculosis in the University of Wales at Cardiff. Here a postgraduate course attracted many graduates from overseas. Heaf devised and validated a skin test for tuberculin sensitivity which gave a quantitative result from a single procedure; this procedure was widely used and bore his name. He was active in the scientific and technical committees of the International Union against Tuberculosis. He retired in 1961, but continued until 1966 to work as chest physician in the Caerphilly area. Heaf was co-author with J. B. McDougal of <span class="italic">Rehabilitation of the Tuberculous</span> (1945) and with J. L. Rusby of <span class="italic">Recent Advances in Tuberculosis</span> (1949), and he edited <span class="italic">Symposium of Tuberculosis</span> (1958).<br>
<br>After the death of his wife in 1966, Heaf moved to Freeland, Oxfordshire, where he indulged his lifelong interest in geology and archaeology. He died in Oxford from a heart attack on 4 February 1973.<br>
