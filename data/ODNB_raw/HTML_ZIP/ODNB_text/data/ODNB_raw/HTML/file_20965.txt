<span class="headword">Overall,  William Henry</span>  (1829&#150;1888), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, son of William Henry Overall, a messenger who died before 1857, and Rosetta Davey, was born on 18 January 1829 at St John's Wood, St Marylebone, Middlesex. Educated at a private school, he entered the office of the town clerk at Guildhall in 1847 as a messenger, and attended the metropolitan evening classes for young men at Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate (later City of London College). On 20 April 1851 he married Mary Anne Elizabeth Bailey; they had fourteen children. Overall purchased his freedom of the City in January 1857 and in March was appointed to the new post of sub-librarian of the corporation library. The library then consisted of a few straggling apartments in the front of the Guildhall, and the corporation was heavily criticized for the poor facilities.<br>
<br>In 1865, on the death of William Turner Alchin, Overall received the appointment of librarian, and superintended the removal of the collections to a spacious new building in Basinghall Street, opened in 1872. The following year the public was admitted for reference and use increased dramatically. In 1874 a museum opened in the basement and Overall, as curator, rapidly expanded the collections with notable acquisitions, especially of Roman remains found in the City. His knowledge of the historical topography of the City of London and its suburbs was extensive and accurate, and the ready help which he afforded in his official position to all enquirers made his services widely appreciated. The library committee (2 July 1888) acknowledged &#145;his devotion to his duties, and urbanity of manner&#146;  (Library Committee Minutes, Corporation of London Records Office). He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in May 1868, and was for many years a member of the councils of the Library Association and the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society.<br>
<br>Overall's first publication was the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Sculpture &hellip; Belonging to the Corporation</span> (1867&#150;8), and he subsequently compiled several other catalogues of special collections. In 1877 he was presented with the honorary freedom and livery of the Clockmakers' Company, of whose library and museum of clocks and watches, deposited in the Guildhall Library, he prepared a printed catalogue in 1875, which was followed in 1881 by his <span class="italic">History</span> of the company. His particular scholarly interest was the City in the early modern period. Among other publications he edited, in 1874, a facsimile of the sixteenth-century map of London attributed to Agas, and with his cousin, H. C. Overall, he compiled an index to the <span class="roman">Remembrancia</span> series of records (1579&#150;1664) in the corporation archives. This work was the outcome of a joint examination of the corporation records and an elaborate report on their nature and condition.<br>
<br>Overall lived at 27 Queen Margaret's Grove, Mildmay Park, before 1872, and at 24 Grosvenor Road, Highbury <i>c</i>.1872&#150;1885. He died at his home, Shaxted, 1 Crouch Hall Road, Crouch End, Hornsey, London, on 28 June 1888 after a long illness and was buried in St Pancras cemetery, Finchley, on 3 July. He was survived by his wife and nine of their children.<br>
