<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walsh,  William Joseph</span>  (1841&#150;1921), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born at 11 Essex Quay, Dublin, on 30 January 1841, the only child of Ralph Walsh, a watchmaker and jeweller, of co. Kerry, and his wife, Mary Pierce, of a Galway family. He was educated at St Laurence O'Toole's Seminary School, Dublin, and entered the Catholic University of Ireland (then under the rectorship of John Henry Newman) in 1855. He entered St Patrick's College, Maynooth, in 1858, and after an outstanding academic career was ordained to the priesthood in 1866. In 1867 he was appointed professor of dogmatic and moral theology at Maynooth, in 1878 vice-president, and in 1880 president. He gave evidence in support of the claims of the tenantry before the Bessborough commission (1880) but he had already come to prominence when he performed brilliantly as an expert witness on canon law in the celebrated O'Keefe law case in 1875.<br>
<br>Following the death of Cardinal Edward McCabe in February 1885, Walsh was elected vicar-capitular of the Dublin archdiocese. On 23 June 1885 he was appointed archbishop of Dublin by Pope Leo XIII. That this was done despite government intrigue in Rome&#151;Walsh's nationalist sympathies being well known&#151;was hailed as a triumph by Irish nationalists. For the next quarter of a century Walsh was the dominating personality in the Irish Catholic church. He built or renovated churches and schools, conducted a busy schedule of pastoral visitations, and promoted initiatives in the areas of sacred music, catechetics, and temperance. A champion of Catholic educational interests, through his service on a number of public bodies he contributed significantly to the development of the modern Irish education system. He served on the senate of the Royal University of Ireland (1883&#150;4), the national education board (1895&#150;1901), the intermediate education board (1892&#150;1909), and the senate of the National University of Ireland of which, in 1908, he became the first chancellor.<br>
<br>Walsh's life spanned the flood-tide of modern Irish nationalism. At the tender age of nine months he was enrolled by his father, a prominent nationalist, as a member of the Repeal Association, and while still a young boy he was introduced to Daniel O'Connell; in 1921 Eamon de Valera expressed gratitude for his &#145;ripe counsel &hellip; in any hour of need&#146;. A constitutional nationalist like his father before him, Walsh was an advocate of home rule and agrarian reform. His support for the controversial Plan of Campaign earned him the displeasure of Rome and cost him the cardinal's hat. During the commission set up in 1888 to inquire into charges made by <span class="italic">The Times</span> against Charles Stewart Parnell he provided crucial assistance to Parnell in exposing Richard Pigott as a forger. When the Parnell divorce crisis broke in 1890, he resisted pressure from both nationalist politicians and ecclesiastics, such as Cardinal H. E. Manning and Archbishop T. W. Croke of Cashel, to come out against Parnell. It was only when secret negotiations between Parnell and himself, conducted through an intermediary, failed to produce a compromise that he led the clerical attack on Parnell's leadership. In later life Walsh became disenchanted with the Irish Parliamentary Party, and in 1917 signalled his shift of allegiance to Sinn F&eacute;in. Though afflicted with poor health in his last years he continued to make an important contribution to political developments and served as a mentor to some Sinn F&eacute;in leaders.<br>
<br>Walsh had a progressive mind, favoured women's rights to the vote and to university education, and advocated bimetallism. He was an early advocate of the use of arbitration to settle labour disputes, and for his successful mediation which brought to an end a protracted strike on the Great Southern and Western Railway in 1890 he was made an honorary freeman of the city of Cork. Aloof in temperament, in private life he was pious, charitable, and of a simple way of living. Aside from law and music he had many interests which reflected his modern outlook. He mastered the Pitman script, became an enthusiastic cyclist and amateur photographer, and was one of the earliest patrons of the motor car. He died on 9 April 1921 at 32 Eccles Street, Dublin, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery on 14 April.<br>
