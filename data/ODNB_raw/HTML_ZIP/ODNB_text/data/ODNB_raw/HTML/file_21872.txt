<span class="headword">Pennie,  John Fitzgerald</span>  (1782&#150;1848), <span class="occ">playwright and poet</span>, was born on 25 March 1782 at the vicarage, East Lulworth, Dorset, the son of Robert Pennie and his wife Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gould. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Pennie family had been socially important, but were ruined by their &#145;loyalty to the Stuart cause and the Roman Catholic religion&#146;  (Davies, 7). Pennie's parents were probably in service at the vicarage. He lacked a regular education, and, self-taught, at fifteen he wrote a tragedy, <span class="italic">The Unhappy Shepherdess</span>, based on a tale in Robert Greene's <span class="italic">History of Dorastus and Fawnia</span>. An appreciative neighbour, Captain Hay Forbes, directed him to London, but the manager of Covent Garden Theatre advised him to go home and write another tragedy.<br>
<br>After work as a solicitor's clerk in Bristol, and as an usher in a private school at Honiton, Pennie joined a travelling company of actors in the west of England. About 1810 he married Cordelia Elizabeth (1773/4&#150;1848), orphan daughter of Jerome Whitfield, a London attorney, and presented a comedy in the theatre at Shaftesbury, with the mother and sister of Edmund Kean. The venture ruined him, and he suffered extreme poverty. In 1814 a company at Chepstow gave a benefit performance of his <span class="italic">Gonzanga</span>, published in October that year. Other theatrical engagements followed, but he quarrelled with all his managers. His tragedy <span class="italic">Ethelwolf</span>, published in 1821, was performed at Weymouth in 1826, and <span class="italic">The Varangian, or, Masonic Honor</span> was played with success at Southampton, but neither <span class="italic">Ethelred the Usurper</span>, written in 1817, nor <span class="italic">The Eve of St Bruce</span>, written in 1832, was performed.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Pennie had opened a school at Lulworth, and published in 1817 <span class="italic">The Royal Minstrel</span>. In the advertisement to this epic poem on the story of David, an impressive Miltonic pastiche, he describes himself as &#145;labouring under every possible disadvantage&#146;. The school failed. In 1828 he moved to Kesworth Cottage, near Wareham, and began to write in the <span class="italic">Dorset County Chronicle</span> and in the <span class="italic">West of England Magazine</span>. Friends helped him to build a cottage at Stoborough, where he lived for the rest of his life. He named it Rogvald, after his second epic, published in 1823, an ambitious work with a west Mercian setting.<br>
<br>Pennie's autobiography, <span class="italic">The Tale of a Modern Genius</span>, published in 1827 under the pseudonym Sylvaticus, reveals a bitter sense of ill-usage and neglect. His other published works included <span class="italic">The Garland of Wild Roses</span>, poems for children (1822). To provide for his son and grandchildren he contracted debts, from which he had just cleared himself when he died at Rogvald on 13 July 1848. His wife had died two days previously. They were buried at East Lulworth.<br>
