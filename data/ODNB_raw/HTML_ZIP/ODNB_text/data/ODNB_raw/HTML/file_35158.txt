<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  (George) Evelyn Pemberton</span>  (1880&#150;1947), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at 7 Eaton Square, London, on 25 July 1880, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35160/', "Sir George Herbert Murray (1849&#150;1936)")</script>, civil servant, and his wife, Helen Mary (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48077/', "John Mulholland, later first Baron Dunleath")</script>. His father was successively chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, secretary of the Post Office, and sole permanent secretary of the Treasury until his retirement in 1911. His son&#151;who was always known as Evelyn&#151;followed in the steps of his father. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, from where he was awarded an <i>aegrotat</i> in the final examination in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1903. In that year he joined the civil service as a junior examiner in the Board of Education, which made appointments by patronage, and from 1905 to 1909 he was private secretary to three successive presidents of the Board of Education. On 10 January 1906 he married Muriel Mildred Elizabeth (1884/5&#150;1961), daughter of Philip Beresford Hope of Bedgebury Park, Kent.<br>
<br>Murray was promoted rapidly to commissioner of customs and excise in 1912 and to his father's old office as secretary of the Post Office in 1914. He was the youngest secretary of the Post Office, and also the longest serving. He remained at St Martin's-le-Grand until 1934, when he returned to his former position at customs and excise until his retirement in 1940.<br>
<br>In 1914 the Post Office was the single largest employer in the country, with a staff of 250,000 and a revenue of &pound;32.6 million. Its business extended beyond the mail services with the addition of financial services and the successive nationalization of telegraphs in 1870 and telephones in 1912. There were major problems concerning labour relations, negotiation with transport companies for the carriage of mail within Britain and across the seas, the adoption of new technology, and relations with foreign administrations. Murray arrived at the Post Office at the end of a period of rapid growth and development, and spent the next twenty years preserving the <i>status quo</i> to the best of his ability. The outbreak of the First World War meant that his task was not easy. Staff shortages, the dislocation of transport, mounting costs, and the need to cut services, dominated his first five years at the Post Office. After the war, he faced conflicting pressures. The public demanded the restoration of pre-war levels of service and charges. Unions were seeking higher wages, which had serious consequences in a labour-intensive service. The Treasury pressed for a speedy return to surplus. Murray thus faced severe problems of wartime dislocation and post-war reconstruction. The Post Office did well to avoid a breakdown of services during the war, and to recover from a deficit of &pound;6.7 million in 1920&#150;21 to a surplus of &pound;12.3 million in 1933&#150;4. His success in coping with the disruptions of the war was marked by his knighthood in 1919.<br>
<br>Murray was a conservative, aloof, and patrician figure, and consequently his administrative style had serious weaknesses. D. O. Lumley, who was Murray's personal secretary from 1922 to 1927, provided an insight into his working methods. He arrived at St Martin's-le-Grand a little before noon and remained until 8 p.m., which allowed him to minimize contact with his colleagues. Lumley remarked that Murray &#145;said very little as a rule, his instructions were laconic and he disliked going into explanations or answering any but the most essential questions&#146;  (Lumley, &#145;The last secretary to the Post Office&#146;). He was punctilious about acquiring facts and would summon officials to provide information. What he would not do was discuss the issue with his officials, or allow them to take part in meetings with the Treasury and the postmaster-general, which he kept in his own hands. The one area in which he did delegate responsibility was labour relations. His emphasis was on orderly transaction of administration, which gave him a horror of anything so vulgar as commercial business practices. He opposed delegation of executive power to the regions although his father had observed before the First World War that the highly centralized system was breaking down. Murray did nothing to produce a workable scheme of reform.<br>
<br>After the war, the select committee on telephones suggested the creation of two distinct organizations for post and telecommunications, which was implemented in a limited form in 1922 with the creation of two new offices of director of postal services and director of telegraphs and telephones, below the secretary. But centralization of power in the hands of the secretary's office remained a problem, and in 1932 a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Lord Bridgeman recommended a regional structure to execute policy, with the central office in London concentrating on policy. The committee also recommended the abolition of the autocratic position of the secretary, and the appointment of a functional board with a director-general as the <i>primus inter pares</i>. Murray was vehemently opposed to the changes, which were &#145;based on incomplete knowledge and a misconception of the position&#146;. In his view, the existing system had proved its worth and &#145;it would be safer to mend it rather than to scrap it&#146;, although he did have enough self-awareness to realize that &#145;my own inclination by temperament has been to the conservative side&#146;  (Post Office archives, Post 33/5529, M8566/1940). His departure from the Post Office coincided with the implementation of the reforms in 1934, and it is significant that his career did not progress. Lumley's assessment of his time at the Post Office is a fair one, that &#145;chinks in the palpably top heavy structure of the Post Office did not show themselves earlier, solely because of the immense administrative ability and experience which Murray brought to its management&#146;  (Lumley, &#145;The last secretary to the Post Office&#146;). He had the abilities to keep an existing structure in reasonable working order but he had little inclination to reform or change.<br>
<br>Both Murray and his father were at some time heirs presumptive to the dukedom of Atholl; his grandson George Iain became the tenth duke in 1957. Murray's only child, George Anthony (<i>b</i>. 1907) was killed in command of an artillery regiment in Italy in 1945. Murray died of cancer at his London home, 23 Fursecroft, George Street, Bryanston Square, on 30 March 1947.<br>
