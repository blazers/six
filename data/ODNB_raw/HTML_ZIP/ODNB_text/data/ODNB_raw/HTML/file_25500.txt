<span class="headword">Sibley,  George</span>  (1824&#150;1891), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, born on 12 August 1824, was a son of Robert Sibley (1789&#150;1849), then county surveyor of Middlesex and one of the early members of the Institution of Civil Engineers. An older brother, Robert Lacon Sibley (<i>c</i>.1818&#150;1882), continued his father's architectural practice. From 1831 to 1838 Sibley attended University College school, London. After serving an apprenticeship in his father's civil engineering and architectural practice in London, he obtained employment in 1845 as assistant engineer on the Bristol and Exeter Railway under Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and afterwards under Charles Hutton Gregory.<br>
<br>In 1851, through James Meadows Rendel, Sibley was appointed an assistant engineer on the East India Railway, in charge of the Chandernagore district. His promotion was rapid. In August 1853 he was placed in charge of the Birbhum district as resident engineer, and in this position designed the two largest brick arch bridges in India, those over the Adjai and More. In December of the same year he was made a district engineer. About 1857 he was appointed deputy chief engineer under George Turnbull, and in 1859 chief engineer of the North-Western Provinces division. On the death of Samuel Power he became, in April 1868, chief engineer of the East India Railway and a member of the board of agency. During his service in the north-west Sibley was responsible for the completion of the Allahabad Jumna Bridge, then the largest railway bridge in the world, designed by A. M. Rendel and G. W. Rendel. He also constructed the Delhi Jumna Bridge, personally designing the foundations, and designed all the works at Delhi connected with the railway.<br>
<br>In 1869 Sibley was involved in a controversy with the Indian government, which had issued a notification implying that the civil engineers received commissions from others than their employers. The accusation does not appear to have been justifiable and Sibley, with the other engineers, addressed a strong remonstrance to the government, supported by the Institution of Civil Engineers.<br>
<br>In January 1875 Sibley left India on furlough, and retired a year later. In consideration of his services he was made a companion in the Order of the Indian Empire. He lived in England in a house, The Mount, which he built of concrete on the summit of Whitehill, Caterham, devoting himself to literature and science. Sibley was always an individualist, marked by his becoming a vegetarian at the age of nineteen. He died of heart disease at his home on 25 October 1891, leaving funds for engineering scholarships and encouraging native students at Calcutta University.<br>
<br>A brother, <a name="cosubject_25501"></a><span class="headword">Septimus William Sibley</span>  (1831&#150;1893), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, distinguished himself as a student at the Middlesex and University College hospitals, where he defeated Lord Lister in competition for medals in both medicine and surgery. He was successively house surgeon, medical registrar, and lecturer in pathology at Middlesex Hospital. Becoming FRCS in 1857, he was the first general practitioner elected to the council. An active member of the British Medical Association, he published <span class="italic">A History and Description of the Cholera Epidemic in London in 1854</span>, besides papers in <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>.<br>
<br>Sibley married Clara F. Carden, daughter of Sir R. W. Carden, bt, MP; their son Walter Knowsley (1862&#150;1944) followed his father into the medical profession.<br>
