<span class="headword">Thomason, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1769, <em>d.</em> 1849), <span class="occ">manufacturer of buttons and jewellery and publisher of medals</span>, was baptized in Birmingham on 14 November 1769, the son of Edward Thomason, a buckle manufacturer, and his wife, Catherine. He served as an apprentice in Matthew Boulton's factory in Soho, Birmingham, from the age of sixteen to twenty-one. In the early 1790s he opened his own factory, in the premises in Church Street, Birmingham, where his father, then retired, had previously had his business. He began by manufacturing gilt and plated buttons, expanding subsequently into the production of jewellery; a medal and token department was added by 1807; three years later he began plating steel cutlery, and the silver- and gold-plating side of the business expanded to include larger objects thereafter. He also did large-scale castings. His experiments with various mechanical devices, recorded in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (1845), were not always successful, and the automatically folding carriage step, for which he took out patents in 1796 and 1798, was defeated by the fashion from 1799 for curved carriage doors. Nevertheless, in 1800 he was a founder member of the Birmingham Philosophical Society, and, as a result of his entrepreneurial skills and flair for self-promotion, grew to become an eminent citizen of &#145;the toy shop of Europe&#146;, as Birmingham came to be known.<br>
<br>In 1807 Thomason produced the first British electioneering medals, for the candidates in the Yorkshire elections. In 1809 he manufactured a medal of his former employer Matthew Boulton, engraved by Peter Wyon after Peter Rouw, which was one of the largest medals then to have been struck. About this time he also made his first medallic series, of six European sovereigns. In 1811&#150;12 he struck many tokens, produced in response to the scarcity of small change. Notable among these are those produced for his own establishment, for the Douglas Bank Company of the Isle of Man, and for the ironmaster Samuel Fereday, all of 1811. In 1812 he produced gold and silver tokens for Berkeley Monck, and in 1815 he struck penny tokens for Magdalen Island, Canada. In May 1814 Thomason travelled to Paris with his wife, Phillis Bown Glover (<i>d</i>. 1861), whom he had married on 26 August 1799, and his son Henry Botfield Thomason (1802&#150;1843).<br>
<br>The Napoleonic wars offered plentiful subjects for medals: one celebrating the treaty of Paris (1814) was especially popular. In 1817 Thomason entered into an agreement with James Mudie to strike a series of medals recording British victories over Napoleon; the dies were engraved by English and French artists, and the results were published by Mudie in <span class="italic">An Historical and Critical Account of a Grand Series of National Medals</span> (1820). Thomason subsequently purchased the dies. In 1819 he began a series of forty-eight medals of the Elgin marbles in the British Museum, which was completed by 1823. In 1828 his workmen finished a series of sixteen medals on scientific subjects, and two years later sixty medals on biblical subjects. Developing his usual practice of presenting medals to important figures, he sent examples of the biblical series to all European monarchs, as well as to the president of the United States and the emperor of China (who returned his). In return for these, and also for his work as vice-consul for Birmingham for several countries, he received several orders and decorations.<br>
<br>Thomason was knighted by William IV in 1832. A series of medallets of &#145;Bible truths&#146; and &#145;Testamental Truths&#146; was published in 1835. He also continued to strike a series of medals of British monarchs from eighteenth-century dies engraved by the Dassiers. Among the Birmingham engravers to work for Thomason were Thomas Halliday and Thomas Webb, and he was also associated with Charles Jones. Thomason sold his factory to George Richmond Collis, seemingly in 1835, and retired fully in 1844. He subsequently lived in Ludlow, Bath, and Warwick, and died at his home in Jury Street, Warwick, on 29 May 1849. He was buried at St Philip's Church, Birmingham.<br>
