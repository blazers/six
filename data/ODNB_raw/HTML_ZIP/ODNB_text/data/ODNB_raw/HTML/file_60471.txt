<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beaton,  Norman Lugard</span>  (1934&#150;1994), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 31 October 1934 in Georgetown, British Guiana, the son of William Solomon Beaton (<i>d</i>. 1983), civil servant, and his wife, Ada, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackintosh (<i>d</i>. 1962). He was educated at St Stephen's School and Queen's College, Georgetown, and the Government Teachers' Training College, where he later became a deputy headmaster. In 1958, at the height of the calypso craze, he became calypso champion of British Guiana. He released twenty-four singles with the Four Bees, a close vocal harmony group he formed in Georgetown, and had several hits. One of the singers with the group was Gloria Moshette, a former darkroom technician; they married in 1958 and had a son, Jayme (<i>b</i>. 1958), and a daughter, Kim (<i>b</i>. 1960), both born in British Guiana.<br>
<br>Beaton left British Guiana for Britain in 1960. He was soon joined by his wife, Gloria, and later by their two children; a third child, Jeremy (<i>b</i>. 1962), was born in England. After postgraduate studies at London University's Institute of Education, Beaton became a teacher in Liverpool. The success of <span class="italic">Jack of Spades</span>, his first stage production at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, for which he composed the music, encouraged him to give up teaching and become a full-time actor. His reputation grew steadily. He progressed from regional theatre to leading roles at the Old Vic, the National Theatre (where he played Angelo in a black cast version of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> in 1981), and the Royal Court Theatre. Apart from Shakespeare, his stage roles also encompassed Pinter, Beckett, Gilbert and Sullivan, Brecht, Moli&egrave;re, and pantomime. In 1974 he started the Black Theatre of Brixton, which was instrumental in developing contemporary black theatre in Britain. For years he acted in plays by a range of black dramatists, including Michael Abbensetts, C. L. R. James, Mustapha Matura, Derek Walcott, and Edgar White.<br>
<br>Beaton also became one of Britain's leading film and television actors. For his performance in <span class="italic">Black Joy</span> (1977) he was named best film actor by the Variety Club of Great Britain, the first black British actor to be honoured with a film award. Nine years later he starred in <span class="italic">Playing Away</span>, with a screenplay by the black writer Caryl Phillips. He gave an outstanding performance as the quiet but determined captain of an all-black cricket team invited to a challenge match against a rural Suffolk side. Among his most memorable television successes were <span class="italic">The Fosters</span> (1976&#150;7), <span class="italic">Black Christmas</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Empire Road</span> (1978&#150;9), <span class="italic">Nice</span> (1984), <span class="italic">Big George is Dead</span> (1987), and <span class="italic">Little Napoleons</span> (1993), but his most memorable role was as the manic barber's shop owner in the long-running situation comedy series <span class="italic">Desmond's</span>. With sharply observed scripts by a young black writer called Trix Worrell, <span class="italic">Desmond's</span> ran from 1989 to 1994 on Channel 4. This show was described as an African-Caribbean equivalent of America's <span class="italic">Cosby Show</span> and, as a result of its popularity in America, in 1991 African-American television star Bill Cosby invited Beaton to make a couple of guest appearances in the <span class="italic">Cosby Show</span>. Beaton readily accepted a role as a cricket-loving doctor, and Cosby was so taken by the actor that he wore Beaton's gift of a <span class="italic">Desmond's</span> baseball cap in the show.<br>
<br>Beaton's first marriage ended in divorce, and in 1969 he had a third son, William, with Jane Atto, with whom he briefly ran a restaurant in London. In 1976 he married Leah Garady, who adopted the children of his first marriage; but this marriage too broke up, and in 1978 he formed a more lasting relationship with Jane Cash. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Beaton but Unbowed</span> (1986), detailed several other, shorter-lived, relationships.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life, Beaton reflected on the roles available to black actors and actresses:<blockquote>My own view is that what you've seen me in are the only roles that are available for black men in this country, and they don't really reflect our views, our understanding of life, our intelligence, or where we are coming from. In that respect I would say that Caryl Phillips' scenario for <span class="italic">Playing Away</span> did get around that particular hurdle. It lived up to nearly all the expectations that black people ought to be living up to. &hellip; But what I find difficult to come to terms with is the absence of a heroic figure like Paul Robeson in all the work I've done. There is no writer on that scale, or in those grand, magnificent terms for film and television about a black figure who we all admire or aspire to be like. And I don't know when our people are going to actually start saying &#145;We are terrific!&#146; and start writing something wonderful about just being us. (Pines, 118&#150;19)</blockquote>Beaton died on 13 December 1994 in Georgetown, in the land of his birth, Guyana, when he collapsed in a friend's arms hours after going home to die. Carmen Munroe, who played Beaton's wife in <span class="italic">Desmond's</span>, told <span class="italic">The Voice</span>:<blockquote>He put his whole life and soul into any part he was asked to play and never spared himself. He worked at his craft and produced brilliance. His particular blend of comic energy and professional application will be missed most keenly in the future when excellence is sought. (<span class="italic">The Voice</span>, 20 Dec 1994)</blockquote>Shortly after his death Channel 4 screened <span class="italic">Shooting Stars</span> in its <span class="italic">Black Christmas</span> season, with a memorable appearance by Beaton, reading a sonnet by Shakespeare.<br>
