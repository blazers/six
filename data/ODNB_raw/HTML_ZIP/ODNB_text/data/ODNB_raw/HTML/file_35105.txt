<span class="headword">Morgan,  John Hartman</span>  (1876&#150;1955), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 20 March 1876, the son of the Revd David Morgan, Congregationalist minister of Ystradfellte, Glamorgan, and his wife, Julia, daughter of Felix Wethli, of Z&uuml;rich. From Caterham School he went with a scholarship to the University College of South Wales where he obtained his London MA in 1896, and with another scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where in 1900 he was placed in the second class of the honour school of modern history. He made his mark at the Oxford Union, and developed a strong interest in diplomatic history. When he left Oxford he joined the Inner Temple, and began to read for the bar (to which he was called in 1915), and joined in 1901 the literary staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> (where he stayed until 1903). But at the same time he continued his postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics under W. A. S. Hewins. He gained a research studentship with which he studied for a time at the University of Berlin. Shortly after his return to England he became a leader writer for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (1904&#150;5). In addition, he had political ambitions, standing unsuccessfully in 1910 as a Liberal candidate for the Edgbaston division of Birmingham in January and West Edinburgh in December. In 1905 he married Clara Maud (<i>d</i>. 1967), daughter of Henry Anthony Hertz; she was an actress known under the name Margaret Halstan. The marriage did not last.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914, Morgan volunteered for combatant service, but his special qualifications were responsible for his appointment to the adjutant-general's staff as Home Office representative with the British expeditionary force, to inquire into the conduct of the Germans in the field. His report was published by the parliamentary recruiting committee. In 1919 he attended the peace conference as assistant adjutant-general, and was later sent to Cologne to report on the British occupation of the Rhineland, becoming British military representative on the prisoners of war commission. Later still, he was for some years in Germany as a member of the subcommission on disarmament of the Inter-Allied Control Commission for Germany, finally retiring from the army in 1923 with the rank of brigadier-general. Morgan was convinced from the outset of his work with the control commission that Germany had no intention of disarming, and after his return he attempted by letters and articles to show that Germany was preparing for another war. But his efforts evoked little response, until, at the conclusion of the Second World War, his book, <span class="italic">Assize of Arms</span> (1945), gathered together the record of his experiences into a formidable indictment.<br>
<br>In 1916 Morgan appeared as counsel for the defence in the trial of Sir Roger Casement and it was at Morgan's suggestion that, on appeal, it was strenuously argued on Casement's behalf that seeking to seduce troops from their allegiance while prisoners of war in Germany was not within the <span class="roman">Statute of Treason</span> of 1351. Morgan had given some lectures on constitutional law as early as 1908, and in 1915 had been appointed professor of constitutional law at University College, London. During his absence, Dr Thomas Baty deputized for him, but in 1923 Morgan returned to active teaching and until his retirement in 1941 his lectures, with their forceful expression of clear-cut opinions upon constitutional developments, never failed to attract large audiences. In addition, from 1926 to 1936 he was reader in constitutional law to the inns of court. He took silk in 1926 and his authority in the field of constitutional law was recognized by his appointment, first to advise the Indian chamber of princes on constitutional changes in India from 1934 to 1937, then to advise Western Australia at the hearing before parliament of the secession petition of that state in 1935.<br>
<br>To the end of his life Morgan remained actively opposed to German rearmament, and he appeared in person at Nuremberg at the trial of the major war criminals, most of whom he had himself interrogated, and his last official duty was to act as legal adviser to the American war crimes commission from 1947 to 1949.<br>
<br>Morgan wrote freely, and with the same force which he displayed in court and in lecturing, and he enjoyed controversy. Among his principal publications were <span class="italic">The House of Lords and the Constitution</span> (1910); a translation entitled <span class="italic">The German War Book</span> (1915); <span class="italic">War, its Conduct and Legal Results</span> (with T. Baty, 1915); <span class="italic">Leaves from a Field Note-Book</span> (1916); <span class="italic">Gentlemen at Arms</span> (1918); <span class="italic">The Present State of Germany</span> (1924); <span class="italic">Viscount Morley, an Appreciation</span> (1924); <span class="italic">Remedies Against the Crown</span> (1925); <span class="italic">The Great Assize</span> (1948); and many contributions to legal and other periodicals. Morgan died at 46 Wood Street, Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, on 8 April 1955.<br>
