<span class="headword">Hill,  Mary Eglantyne <span class="st"> [Polly]</span></span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">economic anthropologist</span>, was born on 10 June 1914 at 35 Park Side, Cambridge, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31230/', "Archibald Vivian Hill (1886&#150;1977)")</script>, physiologist, and his wife, Margaret Neville, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keynes (<i>d</i>. 1970), social reformer. She was the progeny of a formidable Cambridge academic dynasty. Her father won a Nobel prize in 1922. Her maternal grandparents were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39170/', "(John) Neville Keynes")</script>, logician and economist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39171/', "Florence Ada Keynes")</script>, social reformer and local politician, while her uncles were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34310/', "John Maynard Keynes")</script>, the founder of macroeconomics, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31310/', "Sir Geoffrey Keynes")</script>, surgeon and literary scholar.<br>
<br>Polly Hill read economics at Newnham College, Cambridge, but her scholarly ambitions were thwarted by the rule that only those with a first were eligible to do doctoral research. Her first employment was as an editorial assistant for the Royal Economic Society, and then as a researcher for the Fabian Society between 1938 and 1939. During the Second World War she worked successively for the Treasury, the Board of Trade, and the statistics department of the Colonial Office. Given her artistic and literary aspirations&#151;she knew Henry Moore, and had a book of poetry published in 1945&#151;she felt she &#145;languished&#146; during these eleven years. In 1951 she was employed as commercial editor of the weekly publication <span class="italic">West Africa</span>, and her life was &#145;forever changed&#146; by her posting to the Gold Coast in 1952  (Macfarlane). Back in England, at Hampstead register office on 20 July 1953, she married Kenneth Albert Curwood Humphreys (<i>d</i>. 1985), registrar of the West African Examinations Council, based in the Gold Coast, and son of Arthur Curwood Humphreys, schoolmaster. He was two years younger than Polly, and a widower.<br>
<br>The year following her marriage Polly Hill (who always published under her maiden name) finally entered academia, taking up a research fellowship in economics at the University College of the Gold Coast, and beginning research into the lives and economic strategies of migrant cocoa farmers. While her marriage lasted only eight years, she had the &#145;extraordinary good fortune&#146; to give birth, aged forty-two, to her only daughter, Susannah, an event that she felt &#145;profoundly&#146; improved the quality of her work  (Macfarlane). She gradually abandoned the traditional social survey techniques that informed <span class="italic">The Gold Coast Cocoa Farmer: a Preliminary Survey</span> (1956), and crafted a pioneering new role as an engaged, empirical &#145;field economist&#146;. She began to conduct village-level studies, painstakingly collecting life-histories, reconstructing inheritance patterns, and relating them to documentary and archival sources (especially nineteenth-century land maps). She remained in the Gold Coast following its independence (as Ghana) in 1957 and the re-naming of the University College of the Gold Coast as the University of Ghana in 1961.<br>
<br>In 1961&#150;2, at the invitation of Meyer Fortes, Hill spent a year as a Smuts fellow at the department of social anthropology at Cambridge, analysing her data and writing her seminal work <span class="italic">The Migrant Cocoa-Farmers of Southern Ghana</span> (1963). She was awarded a PhD in 1967 for this work, and it was republished in 1997. Eschewing economic abstractions or Marxist generalizations, the book carefully documented how some migrant farmers formed collectives (called &#145;companies&#146;) to purchase parcels of farmland for subsequent investment and redistribution, while others relied on the wealth of their matrilineal group to purchase &#145;family&#146; land as individuals, over which descendants had use-rights. The particular accumulation strategies of these dynamic rural entrepreneurs demonstrated the different economic rationalities they deployed. Her empiricism, and her sensitivity to geography, history, and social structure, led her to challenge homogenous depictions of an African subsistence &#145;peasantry&#146;, and the notion that the west African cocoa industry had been created by the colonial authorities, rather than the farmers themselves. The quality of her field research was visible in the rich narrative case-studies appended to each chapter. The approach defined all her subsequent work.<br>
<br>On returning to Ghana, Hill moved to the Institute of African Studies and began work on cattle rearing in northern Ghana, publishing <span class="italic">Rural Capitalism in West Africa</span> (1970). Concerned about her daughter's health, she left Ghana in 1965 for a non-stipendiary fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge. Ever independent and just as resourceful, she eked out a series of research grants to continue field research in Hausaland, northern Nigeria, and later in Kano, publishing the acclaimed <span class="italic">Rural Hausa: a Village and a Setting</span> (1972) and <span class="italic">Population, Prosperity and Poverty: Rural Kano 1900 to 1970</span> (1977).<br>
<br>Recognition for Hill's contribution to an emergent field of economic anthropology came eventually, with her election in 1973 as Smuts reader in Commonwealth studies at Cambridge. A sabbatical in 1977 took her to Karnataka in India, which led to <span class="italic">Dry Grain Farming Families: Hausaland (Nigeria) and Karnataka (India) Compared</span> (1982). In all she completed thirteen years of field research, more than most anthropologists. Her reputation grew with the expansion of development studies and the waning hold of structural Marxism on anthropology. Mounting frustration at the economists' &#145;ignorance&#146; of the realities of rural poverty led her to write what she called a &#145;constructive&#146; polemic  (Macfarlane). <span class="italic">Development Economics on Trial: the Anthropological Case for the Prosecution</span> (1986) went into six editions.<br>
<br>After what she called her &#145;slow start&#146; Polly Hill's commitment to scholarship (which resulted in nine books and some fifty articles) continued into her eighties, along with her passion for poetry, sculpture, and modern art. Yet her last project on the history of female students at Cambridge was rejected by publishers. This reinforced her sense that, as a woman living for much of her career in the academic &#145;hinterland&#146;, her contributions had been overlooked. Undaunted, she wrote <span class="italic">The History of the Isleham Fens</span> (1990), and co-edited <span class="italic">Lydia and Maynard: Letters between Lydia Lopokova and John Maynard Keynes</span> (1989). Cared for by her daughter and her family in her last years, she died at 4 Coates Drove, Isleham, Ely, Cambridgeshire, on 21 August 2005, of bronchopneumonia. A memorial celebration was held at Clare Hall on 28 May 2006.<br>
