<span class="headword">Robertson,  David</span>  (1806&#150;1896), <span class="occ">businessman and naturalist</span>, was born on 10 December 1806 in Great Hamilton Street, Glasgow, the youngest of the three children of James Robertson (<i>d</i>. 1806/7). His father's death left the family poor and, at the age of eight, he was sent out to work as a cowherd. He spent the rest of his childhood labouring on Lanarkshire farms. About 1824 he was apprenticed for a year to his brother who was a weaver, an arrangement which enabled him to attend evening classes. When the classes failed for lack of support he returned to labouring and farm work, and taught himself to write. He subsequently went to evening classes once more, to learn maths and bookkeeping. He said that his determination to study was due to his severe stammer.<br>
<br>In 1830, encouraged by the anatomist Robert Hunter, Robertson enrolled to study medicine at Anderson's University, Glasgow. He completed the necessary courses in spite of illness but decided against a career in medicine. To keep himself as a student he had set up as a schoolmaster, and later worked for a Glasgow dyer, David Douglas. He became a friend of the family and on 15 May 1836 married Douglas's daughter Hannah, who worked in a china shop owned by her father. The couple soon entered business with his wife's sister, Grace, and her husband, Daniel McDougall, founding the firm of Robertson and McDougall in Jail Square. The business prospered but Hannah Robertson died young (about 1841), as did their two children. On 11 September 1843 Robertson married Hannah Alston (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1826) from the Isle of Man. They had two sons, David (<i>b</i>. 1847) and Thomas (1850&#150;1947).<br>
<br>By the 1850s Robertson had developed an interest in geology and natural history. In 1852 he joined the newly founded Glasgow Natural History Society, of which he was later council member, vice-president, and president (1887&#150;90). He was a member of Glasgow's Philosophical and Geological societies, and was elected a fellow of the Geological Society (1869) and of the Linnean Society (1876).<br>
<br>Robertson often holidayed at Millport on the Isle of Cumbrae, and there one of his friends, Roger Hennedy, introduced him to dredging. Robertson initially began a seaweed collection, but soon became more interested in the shells and marine animals that came up in the dredge. Before long, he was absorbed in the identification both of living species and of the allied forms found in recent geological deposits. Hannah Robertson shared her husband's scientific interests and made the foraminifera her own field of study.<br>
<br>As Robertson's expertise grew he became involved in a wide scientific correspondence. In the mid-1850s he began a study of the post-Tertiary deposits of Scotland in conjunction with George Stewardson Brady and the Revd Henry William Crosskey. They jointly published <span class="italic">A Monograph of the Post-Tertiary Entomostraca</span> as the Palaeontological Society volume for 1874. Robertson also published numerous articles, either on his own or with others, on the identification of marine invertebrates, especially from the Clyde, and of fossils from recent geological deposits. In the late 1850s both Robertson and his wife suffered severe illnesses, as a result of which they retired from business and in 1860 moved to Fernbank at Millport. From then onwards Robertson undertook frequent local dredging trips and almost annual geological tours. He began to attract a coterie of younger scientists, among them the naturalist Thomas Stebbing (1835&#150;1926) and the German zoologist Anton Dohrn (1840&#150;1909).<br>
<br>In 1885 John Murray (1841&#150;1914), director of the <span class="italic">Challenger</span> office in Edinburgh, moved the floating laboratory (the <i>Ark</i>) of the Scottish Marine Station at Granton to Millport. It became the nucleus of the Scottish Marine Biological Association's Millport station. In the mid-1890s Robertson was one of the local dignitaries who sought to put the station on a more permanent footing; he laid the foundation stone shortly before his death. His widow donated his scientific collections to the new institution.<br>
<br>Robertson remained physically and mentally active to the very end of his life. In 1892 he was made a member of a British Association committee to investigate shell-bearing clay deposits in Scotland, a position involving annual excursions on fieldwork. In April 1895 the University of Glasgow conferred on him an honorary LLD. He died at his home, Fernbank, Kames Bay, Millport, on 20 November 1896. His attractive personality and, latterly, considerable age, combined with continued intellectual activity and humble origins, made him something of a wonder to his contemporaries.<br>
