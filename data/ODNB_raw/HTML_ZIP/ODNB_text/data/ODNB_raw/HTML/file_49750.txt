<span class="headword">Eyles, Sir  Francis</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1716), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was the son of John Eyles (<i>d</i>. 1662), wool-stapler and mercer of Devizes, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1666). He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49751/', "Sir John Eyles")</script>. On 26 May 1669 he was apprenticed to Thomas Cooper, haberdasher of London, and he took his freedom in that company on 28 February 1677. The date of his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Ayley of London, merchant, is unknown, but his son and heir, John, was born in 1683.<br>
<br>Eyles was a commission agent in the Atlantic sugar trade in partnership with his brother John, dealing principally with Barbados, where dissenters had built up an effective business network. Although John probably founded the firm of Eyles &amp; Co. and was the senior partner, both brothers are named in documents pertaining to the firm among the records of the Royal Africa Company. On 13 September 1689 they jointly lent &pound;4000 to the new government. The privy council registers mention in passing a Francis Eyles trading to Barbados on 15 November 1690, and the Treasury papers of 1690 describe him as one of the most considerable traders to Barbados in the same year.<br>
<br>Eyles, however, had multiple economic interests. In July 1691 he petitioned the Treasury to pay him out of the funds allocated to reduce Ireland for providing shipping for army stores needed in Ireland. The commissioners of transportation had issued certificates for half the money due, but he had received nothing in eight months. In September 1692 he was engaged in the trade to Madeira and from 1697 onwards he was a director of the Bank of England. From 1695 to 1698 he also served as a director of the East India Company. On 1 July 1697, as deputy governor, he was called in to explain what arrangements the company had made for the provisioning of naval escorts supplied by the Admiralty, and he appealed unsuccessfully for the need for secrecy.<br>
<br>From 1697 Eyles also acted as agent for Barbados, presenting accounts and petitions and supplying information. On 2 November 1697 he petitioned the Board of Trade to maintain the ratio of white to black people in Barbados. On 9 May 1698 he tried to secure payment to Francis Bond, president of the council of Barbados, of an allowance of &pound;600 out of the 4&frac12; per cent duty. On 5 November 1700 he was reappointed agent for two years by the assembly in Barbados.<br>
<br>Eyles's major fortune was probably made as a financier during the French wars, supplying bills of exchange to maintain the army in Flanders. In 1696 he proposed to provide &pound;100,000 in bills of exchange payable in Amsterdam at a rate of 10 guilders 8 stivers. He also volunteered to speak to possible subscribers at Mercers' Hall to see what rate on bills would attract lenders. On 24 April 1697 he was made a trustee for managing subscriptions for circulating exchequer bills of credit, which had been authorized by parliament to remedy a shortfall in several funds.<br>
<br>On 11 May 1697 Eyles supplied 330,000 guilders in return for &pound;30,000 in tallies and orders charged on the 3<i>s</i>. aid plus &pound;4500 in satisfaction for loss or discount. On 1 April 1698 he was one of those questioned when the Lords investigated false endorsements of exchequer bills by Marriott and Knight. But he was still listed, on 4 April, among those providing bills of exchange (repaid in exchequer bills) for the earl of Ranelagh to send to Flanders. Eyles claimed on 8 April 1698 that he had supplied &pound;21,000 to Mr Schuylenberg.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1698 Eyles and his brother were among several merchants who received payment for jointly providing 480,000 florins. On 22 February 1699 he was a member of a syndicate which advanced &pound;300,000 at 8 per cent. On 11 June 1701, together with his brother, he proposed to give letters of credit for the continental army payable in Amsterdam or Rotterdam at sight at a rate of 11 guilders current money for every pound. The Treasury accepted the offer, but for a minimum period of twelve months. On 18 March 1704 he was named one of the three commissioners of account and on 21 March 1706 he was named one of the seven managers appointed to remit &pound;250,000 to Prince Eugene in Italy.<br>
<br>Eyles was elected an assistant of the Levant Company (1703&#150;4) and was a director of both the Old East India Company (1709&#150;10) and of the New East India Company (1702&#150;5, 1706&#150;9). He continued to serve as a director of the Bank of England until 1715 and was deputy governor (1705&#150;7) and governor (5 April 1707 to 1709). He took no position on the question of whether a rapprochement between the bank and the new tory ministry in 1710&#150;13 required a change of leadership at the bank.<br>
<br>Eyles was elected alderman for the London ward of Bridge Without on 23 January 1711 and he stayed on the court until 1716, serving as sheriff in 1710&#150;11. The court of aldermen chose to co-opt a whig merchant prince to balance John Cass. On 1 December 1714 Eyles was created one of the first Hanoverian baronets. His wife predeceased him and was buried on 14 February 1716. Eyles himself died on 24 May 1716 and was buried on 5 June in the family vault at St Helen, Bishopsgate, London. Three sons and one daughter predeceased him: Samuel was baptized on 21 October 1688 and buried on 4 September 1689, another son named Samuel, baptized on 7 June 1691, died before reaching adulthood; Edward was buried on 24 July 1697; and Mary, who was born on 21 November 1695, was buried on 5 November 1698.<br>
<br>None the less, Eyles founded a London business dynasty. His first surviving son, John, second baronet, of Gidea Hall, Essex, became a director of the Bank of England and of the East India and South Sea companies; he was also an MP. He cleared up the mess of the South Sea Bubble and became lord mayor of London in 1726&#150;7. Eyles's second surviving son, Joseph (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1690), also became an alderman, was knighted by George I, and served as sheriff of London in 1734&#150;5.<br>
