<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (1679/80&#150;1730), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and historian</span>, was born at Wrexham, Denbighshire, the son of John Evans (1628/9&#150;1700), dissenting minister and schoolmaster, and his wife, Katherine (<i>bap</i>. 1638), widow of Vavasor Powell (1617&#150;1670), Independent minister, and the fifth daughter of Gilbert Gerard of Crewood, parliamentarian colonel. His great-grandfather and grandfather were successively rectors of Penegoes, Montgomeryshire. After a brief spell at Magdalen College, Oxford, from where he was expelled in 1648, John Evans senior was ordained priest on 28 November 1648, yet soon had doubts about the established church. Briefly master of Bala School, Merioneth, he was appointed master of Oswestry grammar school in July 1657, on Cromwell's recommendation. Ejected in 1662, when he refused to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, he went to live in Wrexham, where in February 1668 he was chosen pastor of the Independent chapel. Licensed as a Congregational minister on 22 May 1672, he came to share his wife's Baptist views; by 1689 his congregation included Baptists as well as Independents and Presbyterians, although the Presbyterians withdrew in 1691.<br>
<br>The younger John Evans was educated first in London, under Thomas Rowe, and from 26 May 1697 at Richard Frankland's academy at Rathmell, Yorkshire, which was continued by Timothy Jollie. Following his father's death, on 16 July 1700, Evans was taken into the household in Boreatton, Shropshire, of Mrs Hunt, widow of Rowland Hunt and sister of Lord Paget, ambassador to the Porte. While living there he studied under James Owen and, according to Harris, read the whole of Matthew Poole's five-volume biblical commentary in Latin and the works of all the Christian writers of the first three centuries after Christ. On 18 August 1702 he was ordained minister at Wrexham, after which he took charge of the new Independent congregation there. In 1704 he was invited to join the ministry at Dublin but was dissuaded from accepting it by Daniel Williams, who offered to take him as his assistant in London. Evans served as assistant at the meeting-house in Hand Alley, Westminster, until Williams's death, in 1716, when he was chosen as his successor. Under Williams's influence he was persuaded to join the Presbyterians in London, rather than the Independents, as was his original intention.<br>
<br>Evans was an eloquent and popular preacher. A man of tolerant views, he played a prominent role on the side of the non-subscribers in the Salters' Hall controversy in 1719. His appreciative congregation built him a new chapel in New Broad Street, Petty France, that opened on 14 December 1729. He also acted as Sunday evening preacher for several years until 1716, and in October 1723 he was elected preacher of the Merchants' Lecture at the same place. Over twenty of his sermons were published separately, yet his most successful publication was a collection, <span class="italic">Practical Discourses Concerning the Christian Temper: Thirty-Eight Sermons</span> (2 vols., 1723); a fourth edition appeared in 1737 and it was still being reprinted as late as 1812. In the preface to the sermons Isaac Watts declared that &#145;they contain, perhaps the most complete summary of those duties which make up the Christian life, that hath been published in our age&#146;  (Wilson, 2.216). The collection was also highly praised by Philip Doddridge, who regarded it as among the best practical treatises in English. Evans's <span class="italic">Sermons on various subjects, preach'd to young people; designed for the promoting of early piety</span> (1725) was reissued in 1802, together with Dr John Erskine's memoir of the author. Evans also published his side of a correspondence with Dr John Cumming, minister of the Scottish church at London Wall, &#145;concerning the regard which ought to be had to Scripture consequences&#146;, and commented on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span> for the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> commentary left unfinished by Matthew Henry. In November 1728 he was awarded the degree of DD from Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>Early in his career Evans had shown an interest in the history of dissent when he edited Charles Owen's account of his brother James Owen, who kept a dissenting academy first at Oswestry and then at Shrewsbury; this was published in 1709. He formed a plan to write a comprehensive history of nonconformity from the Reformation to the civil war and collected a large quantity of materials, some of which were donated, such as Thomas Dixon's information about Cumberland and Westmorland congregations, but most of which he acquired at great expense. He read exhaustively and accumulated a fine library that amounted to 10,000 volumes at his death. Ill health prevented him from writing more than a sixth of the intended three-volume history, but he compiled an invaluable list of the members of Baptist, Independent, and Presbyterian congregations in England and Wales from 1715 to 1729, which is preserved at Dr Williams's Library, London.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1708 at St Katharine by the Tower, London, Evans married Elizabeth, the wealthy daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22952/', "John Quick (bap. 1636, d. 1706)")</script>, ejected minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Cook (<i>d</i>. 1708). With his wife's fortune and his own savings Evans unwisely speculated in the South Sea Company, and lost all his investment. His last years were troubled by financial difficulties, which he kept secret, and his health rapidly worsened. Described as being of &#145;uncommonly tall stature, yet not a lusty man&#146;  (Wilson, 2.219), Evans died, aged fifty, on 16 May 1730, of dropsy and other complications, and was buried in Dr Williams's vault in Bunhill Fields, London; William Harris preached the funeral sermon at New Broad Street, Petty France. Evans was survived by his wife and by one of his daughters, Elizabeth; his library was sold at auction to provide a much needed income for them.<br>
