<span class="headword">Rebecca,  Biagio</span>  (1734/5&#150;1808), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Osimo in the marches of Ancona, Italy. Of his parents, nothing is known. He studied at the Accademia di San Luca, Rome, and while there he met the painter Benjamin West, who remained his lifelong friend. Rebecca went to England in 1761 with the portraitist James George, with whom he was in partnership for a short time. On 31 January 1769 he was one of the first students to enter Royal Academy Schools and was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1771; he exhibited history paintings there for only two years, his historical subjects being of little merit. He painted portraits, for example six whole lengths of Sir John Griffin Griffin's ancestors (1774; Audley End, Essex). He was commissioned to produce watercolour cartoons for painted glass in the chapels at Audley End and New College, Oxford (the latter are now in the City of York Art Gallery), and he was one of the artists who worked on the decoration of the new rooms at Somerset House. Edward Croft-Murray noted that Rebecca subscribed to George Richardson's <span class="italic">A Book of Ceilings, Composed in the Style of the Antique Grotesque</span> (1776), and designed the admission ticket for the first performance of the Handel Commemoration in Westminster Abbey on 26 May 1784  (Croft-Murray, 258). He also contributed illustrations for John Bell's <span class="italic">The Poets of Great Britain Complete from Chaucer to Churchill</span> (1779&#150;88).<br>
<br>Rebecca was especially skilled in decorative painting and became one of the most prolific and talented of the Adam school, working not only for the Adam brothers but also for James and Samuel Wyatt and Henry Holland. He gained a considerable reputation for his grotesque painting (at Heaton Hall, Lancashire, and Lansdowne House, now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art), and feigned bas-reliefs (at Harewood House, Yorkshire, and Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire). With West he was employed at Windsor Castle, where the royal family were much amused by his eccentricities, such as painting a silver coin, placing it in one of the rooms, and laughing &#145;to exhaustion&#146; at a courtier running to pick it up  (Thornbury, 2.2). Reports on Rebecca's character vary from &#145;infinite belief in himself and infinite contempt for everyone else&#146;  (ibid., 2.2&#150;3) to &#145;simplicity of manners and a humane disposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, 28 Feb 1808, 141&#150;2).<br>
<br>Reduced to poverty during his last years, Rebecca obtained a pension from the Royal Academy and died at his lodgings in Oxford Street, London, on 22 February 1808. Joseph Farington noted in his diary that West's account of him would appear in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, where it was reported that &#145;he was handsomely buried at the direction of Mr West, and at the expense of the Royal Academy in St. Pancras churchyard&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 9.3230, 27 Feb 1808). His son, John Biagio Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1847) was an architect.<br>
