<span class="headword">Turner,  Joseph Egbert</span>  (1853&#150;1897), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and composer</span>, was born on 10 January 1853 at 4 Fishergate, Preston, Lancashire, the seventh of the ten children of James Turner, a master tailor and draper, and his wife, Martha, the daughter of Robert Railton of Blackburn. After receiving an education from the Benedictine monks at Ampleforth, Yorkshire, he joined that community and was sent to Belmont Priory, Hereford, which was then the common novitiate for all English Benedictines, but he returned to Ampleforth for solemn profession on 8 December 1876. At that time a new foundation was being established at Fort Augustus on Loch Ness. Turner joined it and was ordained priest there on 22 May 1880. In 1883 he was recalled to Ampleforth as organist and choirmaster.<br>
<br>Little or nothing is known about Turner's musical education. Dom Cuthbert Hedley, his superior at Belmont, was an accomplished organist, and there is some tradition that R. W. Oberhoffer, of York, gave him some tuition. Much of the appeal in Turner's music lies in its quaintly honest structure. Almost self-taught, he attained a standard of craftsmanship always scrupulously correct; he had a special gift of melody, and he was careful never to violate the academic rules of harmonic progression. His work may be described as highly polished if not brilliant. Only in the latter years of his life, years spent in Benedictine parishes, did he achieve fame as a composer and the reputation of one whose church music was without rival in popularity among Roman Catholic choirs, large or small. He was curate at St David's, Swansea (1885&#150;9), St Michael's, Workington (1889&#150;91), St Mary's, Warrington (1891&#150;3), and St Anne's, Edge Hill, Liverpool (1893&#150;7). In Liverpool, Turner was the musical correspondent of the <span class="italic">Catholic Times</span> and a close friend of Sir Charles Santley and the first Eugene Goossens.<br>
<br>Turner's publications consist of seven motets, six litanies, four masses, three benediction services, a <span class="italic">Festival Litany of Loreto</span>, and a few arrangements of other pieces. It was said at his funeral that he also had plans for a grand oratorio. But it was as a composer of settings of the Latin mass that his name became renowned. His first mass (&#145;St John the Baptist&#146;) has a ring of joyous solemnity and a pleasing, often noble, melodic line. Its <span class="roman">Sanctus</span> might owe something to Mozart's <span class="roman">Requiem</span> but its <span class="roman">Gloria</span> is pure Turner. His second mass (&#145;St Cecilia&#146;) was the most popular of its type ever written. Though it is capricious in places, the celestial-sounding opening of its <span class="roman">Gloria</span> and its copious solo passages led to the publication of eleven editions between 1892 and 1973. His third mass (&#145;St Mary Magdalen&#146;) is a work of splendid fervour, having a magnificent <span class="roman">Kyrie</span> and <span class="roman">Gloria</span> and a <span class="roman">Benedictus</span> of angelic simplicity. His fourth mass (&#145;The Good Shepherd&#146;) was, in the opinion of his publisher, Alphonse Cary, his best work. There is a <span class="roman">Kyrie</span> of elegiac beauty and a <span class="roman">Gloria</span> and <span class="roman">Credo</span> containing true polyphony, while the &#145;Dona nobis pacem&#146; of the <span class="roman">Agnus Dei</span> culminates in a mighty fugue. The seven motets&#151;<span class="italic">Adoro te devote</span> (two settings), <span class="italic">Ascendit Deus</span>, <span class="italic">Ave Pater sanctissimae</span>, <span class="italic">Ave verum</span>, <span class="italic">O sacrum convivium</span>, and <span class="italic">O quam suavis</span>&#151;all exhibit similar characteristics.<br>
<br>In September 1897 the 1300th anniversary of the arrival of St Augustine and his companions was celebrated on the shores of Kent, with magnificent ceremonial. A choir of forty Benedictine monks was to take part, but, when summoned to take his place in procession, Turner was found to be stricken with pleurisy and unable to move. Pneumonia developed, and on Sunday 19 September 1897 he died, at 45 Grange Road, Ramsgate, Kent. His grave, with the epitaph &#145;Now I will sing of Thy great mercy&#146;, is in the cemetery attached to St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate.<br>
