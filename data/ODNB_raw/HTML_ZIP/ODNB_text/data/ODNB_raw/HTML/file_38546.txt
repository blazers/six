<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cliff,  Clarice</span>  (1899&#150;1972), <span class="occ">ceramic designer and art director</span>, was born on 20 January 1899 at 19 Meir Street, Tunstall, Staffordshire, one of eight children of Harry Thomas Cliff, iron-moulder, and his wife, Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Machin). Her parents were working-class and of Staffordshire descent. Though not a family of pottery workers, her aunt ran the decorating shop at Alfred Meakin Ltd which the young Clarice visited regularly.<br>
<br>Cliff was educated at the High Street elementary school, and later at Summerbank Road School, Tunstall. At thirteen, she was apprenticed as a painter to Lingard Webster &amp; Co. Ltd, and moved to Hollinshead and Kirkham Ltd as an apprentice lithographer in 1915. She also began attending evening classes at the Tunstall School of Art. In 1916 she joined the Burslem earthenware manufacturers Arthur J. Wilkinson Ltd, a larger firm offering better prospects. Cliff continued her lithographic training at Wilkinsons, completing this in 1920. At this time, her artistic abilities were noticed by the decorating manager Jack Walker, brother-in-law of Arthur Colley Austin Shorter (1882&#150;1963), the firm's managing director. As a result, Cliff was placed in the design studio. Between 1924 and 1925 she attended evening classes at the Burslem School of Art.<br>
<br>Until 1925 Cliff had lived in the family home. In that year, though still unmarried, she moved into her own flat at 40 Snow Hill, Hanley. Cliff was a round-faced young woman who, though perhaps not a natural beauty, was fashionable in the style of the period. At about this time, Cliff's relationship with Colley Shorter, who was married with two daughters, developed beyond the purely professional. This distanced her from the other employees and those members of Shorter's family who ran the firm. Cliff's social life at the time appears to have been limited, and she devoted herself both to her work and to her relationship with Shorter. This relationship provided her with opportunities of which she was fully able to take advantage. In 1925 she was given her own studio in the adjacent Newport pottery, which Wilkinsons had acquired in 1920. In 1927 she attended a training course at the Royal College of Art. The same year she travelled to Paris to study art.<br>
<br>On her return, Cliff developed a range of brightly coloured geometrical patterns, with the assistance of apprentice Gladys Scarlett. These were initially used to decorate surplus stock from the Newport pottery. In July 1928 Cliff coined the name &#145;Bizarre&#146; for the range. Like much of Cliff's work of the late 1920s and 1930s, these designs were art deco in character, and were produced at a time when the style was only beginning to appear in England. Despite the low expectations of Wilkinsons salesmen, &#145;Bizarre&#146; was an immediate success. Later in 1928 Cliff produced the &#145;Crocus&#146; pattern, a simple design made up of a few brushstrokes. Developed from an earlier lithographic design, &#145;Crocus&#146; became an enduring favourite, was adapted to a variety of different pottery shapes, and remained in production until 1963.<br>
<br>In 1929 Cliff began designing new pottery shapes for &#145;Bizarre&#146;. These were severely geometrical and modernistic. Of the principal shapes, &#145;Conical&#146; appeared in 1929, &#145;Stamford&#146; in 1930, and &#145;Le bon jour&#146; and &#145;Biarritz&#146; in 1933. Often inspired by designs illustrated in the French journal <span class="italic">Mobilier et D&eacute;coration</span>, certain shapes derived from Jean T&eacute;tard silver, the designs having initially been used without his knowledge or consent.<br>
<br>Between 1929 and 1936 Cliff designed numerous patterns, including abstract designs, stylized flowers or fruit, and landscapes. Bold and lively, these were normally composed of solid areas of bright enamel colour. They were issued in ranges under titles including &#145;Bizarre&#146;, &#145;Fantasque&#146;, and &#145;Appliqu&eacute;&#146;. Other more limited ranges, such as &#145;Inspiration&#146; and &#145;Latona&#146;, relied on particular glaze-effects. On occasion, Cliff is known to have borrowed patterns from outside sources, as well as from employees in her workshop. Besides tableware and other functional wares, she produced ornamental masks and figures, most notably <span class="italic">Age of Jazz</span> (1930).<br>
<br>Throughout the early 1930s, Cliff's pottery achieved enormous success, and the entire Newport factory was devoted to its production. The wares were sold through department stores and other retail outlets throughout the country, as well as being exported widely. In 1931 she was appointed art director. Cliff was adept at creating publicity, and the &#145;Clarice Cliff&#146; name became an important marketing device. Its use as a backstamp was sometimes indiscriminate&#151;a fact which angered the influential designer and educator Gordon Forsyth when it was placed on a range of pottery designed by contemporary artists during 1933&#150;4.<br>
<br>From 1935 the popularity of &#145;Bizarre&#146; (by then used to describe all Clarice Cliff pottery) waned considerably. In the later 1930s her designs became increasingly conservative, using muted colours or relief-moulded decoration. Wartime restrictions on the production of decorated pottery left her without a major role at the factory. On 21 December 1940 Cliff married Shorter, following the death of his first wife. The marriage was kept secret for almost a year. Following the Second World War, Cliff produced fewer designs, spending most of her time at Chetwynd, their Staffordshire home. She did not have children. By 1960 Shorter's health was failing, and he died in 1963. Cliff sold Wilkinsons the following year to W. R. Midwinter Ltd, and went into retirement. A retrospective exhibition of her work was held at the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery in 1972, to which she contributed catalogue notes. On 23 October that year, Cliff died in Staffordshire of heart failure. Her work has since enjoyed a considerable revival among collectors and students of art deco pottery. Small collections of her work can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and in the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
<br>Cliff has often been derided by modernist design critics who consider her work to fail their criteria for good design. She has also been accused of achieving success only through Shorter. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding her occasional plagiarism, Cliff produced and publicized many striking and adventurous designs. She challenged accepted women's roles through her design of pottery shapes, and achieved success without the benefit of a privileged background. Her major talent was perhaps not as a design originator, but lay in her ability to assemble a range of pottery which captured the mood of the period and the imagination of the public.<br>
