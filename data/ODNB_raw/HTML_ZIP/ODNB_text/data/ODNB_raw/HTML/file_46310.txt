<span class="headword">Birch, Sir  Joseph</span>, first baronet  (1755&#150;1833), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 18 June 1755, the first son of Thomas Birch (<i>d</i>. 1782), a merchant at Liverpool. Like his father Birch was a merchant and had diverse commercial interests, ranging from shipowning and brewing to landholding in Jamaica and stock in the East India Company. It was this personal wealth that allowed him to pursue his political interests, especially in such notoriously expensive boroughs as Liverpool and Nottingham. On 6 March 1786 he married Elizabeth Mary, the daughter of Benjamin Heywood, a prominent Liverpool merchant banker, with whom he had one surviving son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Birch's first foray into politics came in 1802, when he unsuccessfully contested his home town of Liverpool; he was returned as a whig, however, for the borough of Nottingham, not only because of his political sentiments but also because he was willing to use his own money to finance the campaign and possibly because of his nonconformity (he was a Unitarian). His success was short-lived: the defeated tory candidate Daniel Parker Coke successfully petitioned against Birch's return on the grounds that the returning officer, magistrates, and corporation of Nottingham had been biased against Coke in favour of Birch. Birch's election was declared void and at the subsequent by-election in 1803 Coke defeated him. In 1803 Birch made an explicit appeal to the &#145;working class&#146; of Nottingham and portrayed the election of that year as a struggle between rich and poor, but such early radicalism was not much manifested in his later political career, which was one of &#145;an orthodox, well behaved, reforming Whig&#146;  (Thomis, 156&#150;7).<br>
<br>Birch stood at Nottingham again in 1806 but was defeated, and in 1812 he was nominated against his wishes only to be withdrawn when it became clear that he was contesting St Ives, as it turned out, unsuccessfully. He eventually succeeded in becoming an MP again when shortly after the 1812 election he was returned on the influence of Joseph Hague Everett for the constituency of Ludgershall, Wiltshire. He served throughout the remainder of the parliament of 1812 for Ludgershall, his whig credentials being confirmed by his joining Brooks's Club in April 1815. At the election of 1818 his attention returned to Nottingham. By 1818 the corporation of Nottingham had &#145;abandoned any last remaining pretence to neutrality in Parliamentary contests&#146;  (Thomis, 146) but Birch's successful return at the head of the poll for Nottingham in 1818 was also seen at the time as stemming in part from his support among moderate tories who put aside politics and recorded a personal vote in his favour. Birch served as MP for Nottingham until he retired in 1830. He was created a baronet in September 1831 and died on 22 August 1833.<br>
