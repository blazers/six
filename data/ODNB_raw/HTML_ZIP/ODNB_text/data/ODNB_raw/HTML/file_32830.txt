<span class="headword">Dillon,  Harold Arthur  Lee-</span>, seventeenth Viscount Dillon  (1844&#150;1932), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born on 24 January 1844 at 1 Albert Street, Victoria Square, London, was the elder son of Arthur Edmund Dillon-Lee or Lee-Dillon, sixteenth Viscount Dillon (1812&#150;1892), and his wife, Ellen (1809&#150;1896), daughter of James Adderley of King's county, Leinster. The eleventh viscount had married, in 1744, the heiress of the Lees of Ditchley, Oxfordshire, collateral heirs of Sir Henry Lee, champion to Elizabeth I: through them Dillon was descended from Charles II and Barbara Villiers. He was educated at a private school at Eltham, Kent (1855&#150;60), and at Bonn University. He passed out fourth in the army examination of 1862, was gazetted ensign in the rifle brigade on 8 November of that year, and promoted lieutenant in 1866. He saw service in India and Canada, and, on leaving the regular army in 1874, was promoted captain in the Oxfordshire light infantry (militia battalion), retiring with the rank of major in 1891.<br>
<br>After leaving the rifle brigade Lee-Dillon developed the antiquarian interests which eventually led to his becoming one of Britain's leading authorities on the history of arms and armour, medieval costume, and kindred subjects. His first major publication was a new and completely revised edition in 1885 of <span class="italic">Costume in England</span>, by F. W. Fairholt. This was followed by over fifty others, mostly articles in learned journals, notably <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>, and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Army Historical Research</span>, a few under his pen-name Armadillo. The majority are on some aspect of the history of arms and armour, but others include an important study of Calais and the Pale  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 53, 1893), and a catalogue of the paintings, and accounts of various historical manuscripts, at Ditchley.<br>
<br>In 1888 Lee-Dillon had published a seminal paper on the sections of the great 1547 inventory of Henry VIII's possessions covering arms and armour at Westminster, the Tower of London, and Greenwich  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 51, 1888), and in 1892, the year in which he succeeded his father as Viscount Dillon, he was appointed as the first curator of the Tower of London armouries, where the residue of these collections had ended up. At this date the armouries still included arms for current use and were administered by the War Office. Their historic contents were under the charge of army storekeepers, who mistreated them and whose lack of historical knowledge led to the eventual nullification of attempts to arrange and label them correctly by, successively, S. R. Meyrick, J. Hewitt, and J. R. Planch&eacute;. This scandalous state of affairs led to the creation of the official, but semi-honorary, post of curator of the armouries, with responsibility for the study and care of the historic pieces. Dillon was not only the first curator, but he was also the first person to be involved with the armouries to have made a serious study of arms and armour &#145;in the metal&#146; and not only from early documents and illustrations. He carried out a complete reorganization of the collection, during which he made a detailed examination of all the major pieces, identifying for the first time a number of those with important historical associations and correcting many inaccurate attributions. In 1910 he published an <span class="italic">Illustrated Guide to the Armouries</span>, which was, in fact, a summary catalogue of pieces exhibited. He retired from the armouries in 1913, having laid the foundation for their eventual conversion into a modern museum.<br>
<br>Dillon was assisted in identifying the original owners of some of the Tower armours by the reappearance of a folio album of captioned designs of armours produced in the English Royal Almain Armoury at Greenwich for Marian and Elizabethan courtiers. The album had resurfaced in the catalogue of the collection of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Spitzer in 1892; the South Kensington (now Victoria and Albert) Museum failed to purchase it at the Spitzer sale in 1893, but, thanks to Dillon's intervention and support, managed to acquire it privately in 1894. In 1895 Dillon published an article on it  (<span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>, 52, 1895) followed in 1905 by a volume of facsimile reproductions of a selection of the plates under the title <span class="italic">An Almain Armourer's Album</span>. Both, although now out of date, were milestones in the study of English armour.<br>
<br>Dillon was chairman of the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery (1894&#150;1928), to which he presented and bequeathed various portraits from Ditchley, among them likenesses of Elizabeth I, Archbishop William Wareham, Sir Philip Sidney, and Sir Henry Lee (by Antonio Moro). He was also president of the Royal Archaeological Institute (1892&#150;8) and of the Society of Antiquaries (1897&#150;1904), a trustee of the British Museum (1905&#150;12) and of the Wallace Collection (1918&#150;31), and antiquary to the Royal Academy. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy on its foundation in 1902, appointed CH in 1921, and was also an honorary freeman of the Armourers' and Brasiers' Company of London.<br>
<br>Dillon married twice: first, on 3 November 1870, in Ottawa, Julia (<i>d</i>. 1925), eldest daughter of Isaac Brock Stanton of Ottawa and his wife, Maria, daughter of James Wilson of Scarr, co. Wexford, with whom he had one son who predeceased him; second, on 15 June 1926, Margaret Louisa Everard (<i>d</i>. 1954), daughter of the Revd Henry Edward Browne ffolkes, and widow of the Revd John Erasmus Philipps.<br>
<br>A true aristocrat, with a fine head and figure, Lord Dillon was equally at home in a royal palace and in the third-class carriage of the Great Western Railway, by which for many years he travelled from Charlbury to London and back several times a week. He had two maxims, one that &#145;Duty is doing more than you are paid for&#146;, and the other, in connection with enquiries relating to his expertise, &#145;Never say you do not know, but find out and then reply&#146;. He died at Ditchley on 18 December 1932, and was buried in Enstone church, Oxfordshire. He was succeeded as eighteenth viscount by his nephew Arthur Henry (1875&#150;1934), who sold Ditchley in 1933, when nearly all the remaining pictures in the collection were dispersed.<br>
