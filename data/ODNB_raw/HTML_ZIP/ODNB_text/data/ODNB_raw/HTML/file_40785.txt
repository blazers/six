<span class="headword">Easdall,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was born of unknown parents in Westminster. He was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and started his working career acting as an attorney collecting rents for Westminster Abbey, although there is no record of his appointment. Leases reveal that Easdall acted as an attorney for Richard Neile in Rochester diocese in 1610, in which year he also performed the duties of a personal secretary and carried out a survey of the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield for Neile, prior to the latter's becoming bishop of that see. It was after Neile's move to Lincoln in 1614, the year that Easdall graduated LLB from Cambridge, that Easdall's career really blossomed. In June 1616 he was appointed commissary to the bishop for the archdeaconries of Lincoln and Stow and official of the archdeacon of Buckingham (who happened to be Neile's half-brother, Robert Newell). Easdall remained on close terms with Neile, but 1617 witnessed a parting of their ways as Neile moved to Durham. In 1620 Easdall proceeded LLD, and in 1623 submitted a request to join Doctors' Commons, although he does not appear to have started paying dues until 1624.<br>
<br>From that date Easdall occupied various prominent positions in the northern province. It may have been in recognition of a shift of interests that he surrendered the office of porter of Westminster Abbey close. From 1624 to 1632 he occupied, through the patronage of Archbishop Toby Matthew, the important post of commissary of the exchequer and prerogative court of York. He also shared the chancellorship of York&#151;with Matthew Dodsworth (1624&#150;7), Edward Mainwaring (1627&#150;37), and George Riddell (1637&#150;40). It is perhaps ironic that Easdall was appointed, additionally, chancellor of the diocese of Durham in 1627 just as Neile was leaving for Winchester, but they were reunited when he retired from that post to devote all his efforts to York in 1632 on Neile's appointment as archbishop. By this date Easdall had also become a commissioner for causes ecclesiastical in the province of York.<br>
<br>Easdall served as a justice of the peace for Yorkshire between 1629 and 1632. Once described as a &#145;typical Caroline bureaucrat of the school of Wentworth and of &#147;Thorough&#148;&#146;  (Marchant, <span class="italic">Church under the Law</span>, 48), Easdall was much more than that. As a loyal friend of Richard Neile&#151;acting as godfather to the latter's grandchildren&#151;Easdall deserves great credit for the success of the campaigns which were initiated throughout the province of York in the 1630s. It was he who masterminded the metropolitical visitation of 1632&#150;3; he personally ensured that it was one of the most successful in living memory, both in its effect on the lives of clergy and laity and in its production of revenue for the archbishop, and that the campaign to restore churches initiated at that visitation was sustained throughout the province through the work of the chancery court to which his roving inspectors reported. Easdall's reports to Neile serve as key evidence of diocesan administration in the 1630s and indicate that Easdall was as committed as his episcopal master to the programme to promote the &#145;beauty of holiness&#146;. Easdall died in York in December 1643 and was buried on 16 December in York Minster. An administration of his goods was entered on 22 February 1644 and finalized on 2 May. He left everything, apart from an earlier gift of &pound;20 for Peterhouse Chapel, to his daughter Barbara, his wife, whose name is unknown, having apparently died.<br>
