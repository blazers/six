<span class="headword">Webster,  David James</span>  (1931&#150;2003), <span class="occ">television producer and broadcasting executive</span>, was born at 22 Belvedere Road, Taunton, Somerset, on 11 January 1931, the younger child and only son of Alexander James (Alec) Webster, a master draper and outfitter, and his wife, Clara (or Clare), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bond. His mother was an early feminist and a founder of one of the first birth control clinics. His sister became, as Sheila Kitzinger (<i>b</i>. 1929), a leading birth educator and a social anthropologist. He was educated at Taunton School (1938&#150;49). When he was called up for national service he registered as a conscientious objector and worked first as a farm labourer and later as a hospital porter. In 1951, as an administrator of the World Movement for World Federal Government, he got his first taste of international politics, which was to occupy him for much of his working life. He then spent a year at Ruskin College, Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1953 Webster joined the BBC's external services news department at Bush House, London, as a trainee. Two years later he married Lucy Law, of Princeton, New Jersey; they had two sons. After a variety of assignments he joined BBC television talks in 1959 at a time when that department was at its strongest, and he rubbed shoulders in the Lime Grove studios in London with the likes of Huw Wheldon, David Attenborough, Alasdair Milne, and Anthony Jay. Alongside such talented people he learned his television skills and prospered. His colleagues learned to admire his ever growing address book. As a producer on <span class="italic">Panorama</span> from 1959 onwards he did several tours of duty in Vietnam at the height of the war there and he did some distinguished work with Richard Dimbleby after the earthquake in Skopje. By 1967 he was the editor of <span class="italic">Panorama</span>, and he ensured that the programme continued to matter in the week's viewing. There were two nicknames for him at Lime Grove: King-size because of his physique, and Slosh because of his genuine enjoyment of the good life. He became executive editor of the BBC's current affairs group in 1969, and assistant head in 1970.<br>
<br>But it was the United States that attracted Webster and it was in New York and in Washington, DC, that he was seen at his best. The BBC shrewdly made him its representative in the United States in 1971 and for the next four years he ensured that Americans at all levels knew what the BBC stood for. He was encouraged to come back to London in 1976 to take charge of the BBC's information services, a post renamed the following year as director, public affairs, in charge of the BBC's public relations. He was promoted to the board of management in 1977 but in 1981 he was back in New York, this time with the newly coined title of director, United States. Also in 1981, his first marriage having ended in divorce, he married another American, Elizabeth Drew (<i>b</i>. 1935), of Washington, an influential political writer and <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> columnist. Always a lover of long lunches and decent dinners, Webster was known in New York as the 42 Man&#151;twice a day at 21, the restaurant he preferred. The then chairman of the BBC, George Howard, allowed him to fly to London by Concorde for monthly board meetings, an indulgence too far for the next chairman, Stuart Young, who reportedly found Webster irritating. Webster's BBC career ended in 1985, although he remained a consultant and continued to live in the United States.<br>
<br>After leaving the BBC Webster worked as an adviser to several media organizations. But without the crutch of the BBC he became a relatively peripheral figure. Although beset by illness, he continued to travel and set up the Trans-Atlantic Dialogue on Broadcasting and Information Society in 1988. Dismissed by some as another talking shop, it did provide generous support after the fall of the Berlin Wall to the newly liberated countries of eastern Europe, especially Czechoslovakia, in the form of advice on broadcasting legislation and regulatory bodies. Webster fought to ensure that the countries formerly under Soviet influence learned to liberate their media. He was also a resident associate of the Carnegie Endowment (1985&#150;7), a senior fellow at the Annenberg Institute, Washington (1987&#150;92), chairman of the International Disaster Communications Project (1987&#150;91), and a member of the advisory council of the Ditchley Foundation of the USA (from 1981). These activities underlined the fact that Webster was more than a TV executive: he genuinely believed that dialogue could make things better. He died from heart failure, on 6 August 2003, in Washington, DC. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and the two sons of his first marriage.<br>
