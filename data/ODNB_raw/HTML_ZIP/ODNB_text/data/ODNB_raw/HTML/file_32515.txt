<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colville, Sir  Stanley Cecil James</span>  (1861&#150;1939), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at 42 Eaton Place, London, on 21 February 1861. He was the second son of Charles John Colville, tenth Lord Colville of Culross, later first Viscount Colville of Culross (1818&#150;1903), chamberlain to Queen Alexandra as princess of Wales and queen. His mother was Cecile Katherine Mary (<i>d</i>. 1907), daughter of Robert John Carrington, second Baron Carrington. After attending Marlborough College, Colville entered the training ship <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet in July 1874. In October 1876 he was appointed as midshipman to the battleship <i>Sultan</i> in the Mediterranean under its captain, Prince Alfred, duke of Edinburgh. He remained with the duke when he transferred to the ironclad <i>Black Prince</i>, Channel Fleet, in May 1878. In January 1879 he was appointed as midshipman to the corvette <i>Boedicea</i> commanded by Commodore F. W. Richards at the Cape station. Colville landed with the naval brigade during the Anglo-Zulu War, and took part in subsequent land operations. He was promoted sub-lieutenant in October 1880, and continued training and examinations at Portsmouth.<br>
<br>In July 1882 Colville joined the battleship <i>Alexandra</i>, Mediterranean Fleet, flagship of Admiral Sir F. B. P. Seymour, and was present at the bombardment of Alexandria (11 July) and subsequent land operations. He was promoted lieutenant in November 1882. In May 1883 he joined the corvette <i>Canada</i>, North America station, in which Prince George of Wales (the future George V) was midshipman. In September 1884 Colville rejoined the <i>Alexandra</i> in the Mediterranean, and served with the naval brigade attempting to relieve General Gordon at Khartoum. Colville served for three years again under the duke of Edinburgh, now commander-in-chief, Mediterranean Fleet, being appointed to his flagship <i>Alexandra</i> in February 1886. In October 1889 Colville joined the sloop <i>Buzzard</i> under Commander J. A. Baker on the North America and West Indies station.<br>
<br>In August 1890 Colville was appointed as first lieutenant to the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>. He served for two years and was promoted commander in August 1892. In May 1893 Colville joined the battleship <i>Trafalgar</i>, flagship of Admiral Sir Compton E. Domvile, second in command, Mediterranean Fleet, where he served for three years. In 1896 Colville was seconded to the Egyptian government at the request of the sirdar, General Sir Herbert Kitchener, to command gunboats of the Nile flotilla and support the British army's campaign against the khalifa. Colville was badly wounded but was mentioned in dispatches, promoted captain in October 1896, and appointed CB.<br>
<br>During 1897&#150;8 Colville held a shore appointment as naval adviser to the inspector-general of fortifications at the War Office, London. In September 1898 he joined the battleship <i>Barfleur</i>, China station, as flag captain to Admiral Penrose Fitzgerald for eighteen months. In March 1900 Colville was appointed flag captain to Vice-Admiral Sir Frederick Bedford in the cruiser <i>Crescent</i> on the North America and West Indies station for two years. On 19 December 1902 Colville married Lady Adelaide Jane (<i>b</i>. 1876/7), youngest daughter of admiral of the fleet Richard J. Meade, fourth earl of Clanwilliam; they subsequently had four sons.<br>
<br>In May 1902 Colville was appointed as chief of staff to Admiral Sir Compton E. Domvile, commander-in-chief, Mediterranean Fleet, flying his flag in the battleship <i>Bulwark</i>, and served for three years. In December 1905 Colville was appointed captain of the battleship <i>Hindustan</i>, Atlantic Fleet, his only independent captain's command. He reached flag rank in November 1906 at the early age of forty-five. In January 1908 Colville hoisted his rear-admiral's flag in the battleship <i>Bulwark</i>, Home Fleet, under Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman. In February 1909 he was appointed rear-admiral, 1st cruiser squadron, Channel Fleet, flying his flag in <i>Drake</i>. In July 1909 he transferred his flag to <i>Indomitable</i>, one of the three new battle cruisers of the dreadnought era which now comprised the prestigious 1st cruiser squadron, Home Fleet. Colville was promoted vice-admiral in April 1911. He attended a senior officers' course at Portsmouth and in June 1912 hoisted his flag in the battleship <i>Collingwood</i>, 1st squadron, Home Fleet, spending two years in this command. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 Colville was ashore on half-pay. In early September 1914 he accepted the shore command of vice-admiral, Orkneys and Shetlands, under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander-in-chief, Grand Fleet. Colville was promoted admiral in September 1914.<br>
<br>Although Colville missed the sea war, this was a vital appointment. He was responsible for the naval establishments and defence of the islands, particularly Scapa Flow, the Grand Fleet's main anchorage. Jellicoe so approved of Colville's competence that in early 1916 the Admiralty officially expressed its appreciation. Colville was also Jellicoe's choice to succeed him and Vice-Admiral Sir Cecil Burney, second in command, Grand Fleet, in the event of any disaster. In February 1916 Colville was appointed as commander-in-chief, Portsmouth, the most important royal dockyard and another vital shore appointment. Colville hauled down his flag in March 1919, and in July was appointed principal aide-de-camp to George V. He was placed on the retired list in April 1922.<br>
<br>Colville was appointed rear-admiral of the United Kingdom in 1927 and vice-admiral of the United Kingdom and lieutenant of the Admiralty in 1929, ancient offices revived by Edward VII in 1901. Colville was appointed CVO in 1902, KCB in 1912, GCVO in 1915, GCMG in 1919, and GCB in 1921. His foreign decorations included appointment to the Japanese order of the Rising Sun and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He died at his home, Larchwood, Crawley Down, Sussex, on 9 April 1939. Lady Colville survived him. Colville owed much to his royal connections in his fortunate sea and shore appointments. Yet he was a fine seaman and able administrator, who met the challenge of rapid technological change while embodying the virtues of his patrician class: courage, loyalty, honour, a deep responsibility for the men under his command, and complete devotion to the Royal Navy.<br>
