<span class="headword">Polack,  Joel Samuel</span>  (1807&#150;1882), <span class="occ">trader and author</span>, was born in London on 28 March 1807, the son of Solomon Polack, painter and engraver, and his wife, Sarah. He had at least one brother and two sisters. The family were Jews who had migrated from the Netherlands to England. In early life he appears to have travelled both in Europe and America and to have done some work as an artist. He then served in the War Office in South Africa and Mauritius, in the commissariat and ordnance departments. In 1831 he emigrated via Australia to New Zealand. He lived for a year at Hokianga as a trader and traveller, living with a Maori woman. In 1832 or 1833 he moved to the Bay of Islands where he opened a ship-chandler's store in connection with a broker's business at Sydney. He paid long visits to Sydney, for four or five months at a time, and travelled much about New Zealand. He prospered with his flax trading, timber, and general produce businesses. He learned the Maori language and purchased from the Maori about 1100 acres of land. He built a house which he called Parramatta, and developed his land by, among other things, building on it the country's first brewery in 1835. In May 1837 he returned to London. Next year he was a prominent witness before the select committee of the House of Lords on New Zealand, urging the British government to assume full colonial responsibility over it. His evidence was questioned in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and Polack brought an action against the paper; on 2 July 1839 he secured a verdict, with &pound;100 damages.<br>
<br>In 1838 Polack published <span class="italic">New Zealand: a Narrative of Travels and Adventures</span>, on the strength of which he was elected to the newly formed Colonial Society of London. A more ambitious work, <span class="italic">Manners and Customs of the New Zealanders</span>, was published in London in 1840 (2 vols.). The book was intended for European emigrants, but is an early and thoughtful account of Maori society. In it he advocated colonization which he claimed would benefit the Maori, unlike the destructive unorganized settlement. The book was well illustrated by Polack himself.<br>
<br>In 1842 Polack returned to New Zealand, having auctioned off some of his land in a public sale. After the treaty of Waitangi, however, Polack found himself under scrutiny by the new land claims commissioners and then lost all his household goods and his home in the war of 1845. He moved to Auckland where he continued to trade and speculate in land.<br>
<br>Polack went in 1850 to the United States and settled in San Francisco, where he married Mary, the widow of William Hart, both of whom had been settlers in New Zealand. He died in San Francisco on 17 April 1882. He was buried in Laurel Hill cemetery and was later, in 1946, moved to lie beside his wife in Cypress Lawn cemetery, Colma, San Francisco. Polack's books, together with his unpublished letters, give an usually good and early account of life in New Zealand.<br>
