<span class="headword">Garratt,  Geoffrey Theodore</span>  (1888&#150;1942), <span class="occ">administrator in India and author</span>, was born on 7 November 1888 at The Grange, Little Tew, Oxfordshire, the sixth and youngest son of Charles Foster Garratt, who was vicar of Little Tew from 1858 to 1880, and his wife, Agnes Mary Percival, who came from a banking family. He was educated at Rugby School, and won a scholarship worth &pound;100 and tenable for five years at Hertford College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in mathematical moderations (1908) and a second in modern history (1911). He succeeded in the Indian Civil Service examination in 1912, and arrived in India in 1913, serving in Bombay as assistant collector and magistrate. His work involved close contact with rural society, and he was impressed by the abject poverty of Indian cultivators. During the First World War he joined the Indian army reserve of officers, and fought in the Mesopotamia campaign from 1916 to 1919. On 3 April 1920 he married Annie Beryl (1895/6&#150;1949), daughter of Charles Francis Benthall, an Anglican clergyman, of Benthall Hall, Shropshire.<br>
<br>Garratt tendered his resignation from the Indian Civil Service in 1921, protesting against the squandering of money on building unnecessary amenities, including a costly fountain at Government House, while the Indian people lacked basic necessities. The resignation took formal effect in August 1922. During 1921&#150;2 he was Berlin correspondent of the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>. He joined the Labour Party and in 1924 stood unsuccessfully as Labour parliamentary candidate for Cambridgeshire. He bought a farm at Barrington, Cambridgeshire, and was a member of the county council from 1925 to 1931. In November 1927 he sailed for India, and he stayed there until February 1928. After returning home, he published <span class="italic">An Indian Commentary</span> (1928), on which Edward John Thompson, another writer and Indian specialist, wrote a review. Garratt and Thompson became close friends and collaborators. Philip Rattray, the protagonist in <span class="italic">So a Poor Ghost</span> (1933), a novel written by Thompson, was modelled on Garratt. He supported the cause of Indian nationalism, but was not wholeheartedly sympathetic to the leadership of the Indian National Congress. At the general election of 1929 he again failed to win the Cambridgeshire seat.<br>
<br>In 1930, as reporter for <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, Garratt covered the first round-table conference in London, where representatives of the government and various strands of Indian political opinion discussed possible constitutional advance for India. He then planned to go to India to organize welfare work for jute mills of Bird &amp; Co., Calcutta, of which his brother-in-law Edward Charles Benthall was partner. On hearing this, Edward Taylor Scott, the editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, approached Garratt and arranged that he should contribute articles to the paper from India. Garratt arrived in India in March 1931, met Gandhi, by now chief spokesman of Indian nationalism, and Irwin, the viceroy, in Delhi, and attended the Congress session in Karachi. He observed that an early resolution of political conflict between the Congress and the British raj, giving elected Indian ministers real responsibility in a new constitutional arrangement, was urgently needed. By October he had returned to Britain (being defeated for a third time as candidate for Cambridgeshire) and attended the second round-table conference as adviser to the Labour Party group. In December he returned to India, as he was invited by the diwan of Baroda, a princely state, to become <i>naib diwan</i>&#151;secretary to the prime minister&#151;of that state. However, the appointment was not realized, owing to the objection of the government of India. After working out the welfare scheme for Bird &amp; Co., he went back to Britain in April 1932.<br>
<br>Garratt settled in Bishopsteignton House, near Teignmouth in south Devon, and contributed a number of reviews and articles to journals. In 1932 he published <span class="italic">The Mugwumps and the Labour Party</span>, in which he discussed the uneasy relationship within the Labour Party between socialist intellectuals and trade union leaders. In 1934 Garratt and Thompson published <span class="italic">The Rise and Fulfilment of British Rule in India</span>, which came to be regarded as the first British attempt to understand the Indian nationalist movement on its own terms. In the general election of 1935 he unsuccessfully stood for Wrekin, Shropshire. Meanwhile, preparing a biography of Lord Brougham, published in 1935 and followed in 1936 by another historical study, <span class="italic">The Two Mr Gladstones</span>, he contemplated an academic career, but developments in international relations drew him back into journalism and politics. In 1936 he went to Ethiopia as correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> to cover the war. He saw the raising of sanctions against Italy by Britain as &#145;a lunacy&#146;, as Italy's real aims in Ethiopia were &#145;only too blatant&#146;  (Garratt to Thompson, 22 June 1936, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. C 5289/125).<br>
<br>Garratt's keen sense of public duty and radical sympathies were displayed during the Spanish Civil War. He became a leading member of the National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief. He spent most of 1937 in Spain and organized transport to and from the besieged Madrid, bringing food in and evacuating children. In May he was temporarily back in Britain, as he was persuaded to fight a by-election as a Labour candidate at the Plymouth Drake constituency, but was defeated by his Conservative opponent. During the campaign he attacked &#145;Eden and his foul and fascist foreign office&#146;  (Garratt to Thompson, 9 May 1937, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. C 5289/133), and afterwards was &#145;ticked off&#146; by the Labour Party for having said too much about Spain  (Garratt to Thompson, 10 Sept 1937, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. C 5289/137). His despair with the party was deep. In 1938 he joined the co-ordinating committee for refugees and became temporary secretary for the organization. On the basis of his first-hand experiences in Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War, he wrote <span class="italic">Mussolini's Roman Empire</span> (1938), in which he tried to convince readers that Mussolini was more dangerous than most Englishmen believed, and alleged that British foreign policy was dictated by pro-fascists in high places.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out Garratt was keen to enlist, but was not called up immediately. In January 1940 he went to Finland as correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> to cover the Russo-Finnish War. After a long wait, in July 1940 he joined the Pioneer Corps. By February 1941 he was appointed captain and second in command of a company of German volunteers removing the debris of buildings hit by German bombs in London. By September they moved to Pembroke Dock, where they built defences as well as doing anti-invasion exercises. Garratt felt irritated by the reluctance of the British government to use people like himself or Thompson in the critical situation in India. In April 1942 he sought to make contact with Sir Stafford Cripps, who was leading a cabinet mission to India in an attempt (vain as it turned out) to enlist Congress co-operation in the war in return for radical political change in peacetime.<br>
<br>Garratt died at the Defensible Barracks at Pembroke Dock on 28 April 1942 &#145;from multiple injuries accidentally sustained through the explosion of a beach mine during a military lecture&#146;  (d. cert.). A fortnight before his death he was appointed MBE. He was an individual of ability, energy, and public spirit. A tall man (about 6 foot), he was known for his modesty and the charm of his character; according to his wife, he had a peculiarly peaceful expression even in times of stress. Garratt and his wife adopted two sons in 1938.<br>
