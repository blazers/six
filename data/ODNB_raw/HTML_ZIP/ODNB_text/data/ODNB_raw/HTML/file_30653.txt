<span class="headword">Bayly, Sir  Lewis</span>  (1857&#150;1938), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Woolwich on 28 September 1857, the third son of Captain Neville Bayly, Royal Horse Artillery, and his wife, Henrietta Charlotte, daughter of General Charles George Gordon, Royal Artillery, and great-great-nephew of Admiral Sir Richard Keats. He was educated in the <i>Britannia</i>, passing out in 1872 as a navigating cadet, but he was promoted sub-lieutenant for navigating duties in 1876, when the navigating branch was abolished, and changed over to the executive branch; he became lieutenant in 1881. He served in the Second Anglo-Asante War (1873&#150;4) and in the Congo expedition (1875) in the <i>Encounter</i>, and in the 1882 Egyptian campaign. In 1883 he specialized in the use of torpedoes. He married in 1892 Yves Henrietta Stella, daughter of Henry Annesley Voysey; they had no children. Bayly was promoted commander in June 1894, and captain in December 1899. His first important appointment was as naval attach&eacute; to the USA in June 1900; in the two years there he gained experience that was to stand him in good stead in his last appointment.<br>
<br>In 1907, after commanding the cruiser <i>Talbot</i> on the China station and the battleship <i>Queen</i> in the Mediterranean, Bayly was selected to command the destroyer flotillas in the Home Fleet, with the rank of commodore, in the <i>Attentive</i>. In Bayly's own words, &#145;destroyers were then a comparatively new arm, and their capabilities when working in flotillas were not very well understood&#146;  (Bayly, 120). A fine seaman and a hard taskmaster, he completed an immense programme of exercises during the next two years and laid solid foundations for the future handling and administration of flotillas. In 1908 he was appointed president of the War College, Portsmouth, and promoted to flag rank; he held the presidency until 1911 when he was given command of the 1st battle-cruiser squadron (flag in the <i>Indomitable</i> and later in the <i>Lion</i>), followed by the command of the 3rd battle squadron (1913&#150;14, flag in the <i>King Edward VII</i>), and, in 1914, by that of the 1st battle squadron (flag in the <i>Marlborough</i>). This squadron was part of the Grand Fleet assembled at Scapa Flow on the outbreak of war in August 1914. In September Bayly was promoted vice-admiral. In December he was appointed to command the recently strengthened Channel Fleet (flag in the <i>Lord Nelson</i>), in preparation for offensive operations on the Belgian coast, but a few days later was relieved of his command because, during exercises, one of his battleships, the <i>Formidable</i>, was sunk by torpedo submarine with the loss of 547 lives. Bayly had ignored the threat of submarines and failed to take even the elementary precautions then in force, especially that of steaming a zigzag course. He was informed that he had lost their lordships' confidence. He asked for a court martial, but this was refused, and he was appointed president of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. With that appointment his active career appeared to have ended, but his greatest work still lay ahead of him. In July 1915 he was appointed to command the western approaches with base at Queenstown and in the beginning of 1916 was raised to the position of commander-in-chief. The German U-boat campaign was at its height and the frequent sinkings in the western approaches could only be checked by extremely vigorous defence measures and by exploiting new methods of attacking the submarines. Bayly had all the qualities for conducting the anti-submarine campaign, but for the first two years he never had sufficient ships for the large area for which he was responsible, until, in 1917, welcome reinforcements from the USA began to arrive.<br>
<br>Bayly, who had been promoted admiral in 1917, proved the ideal commander of a mixed Anglo-American force. He made the senior American officer (Captain Joel Roberts Poinsett Pringle, afterwards vice-admiral) his chief of staff, the first foreign naval officer to hold such an appointment, and he mixed the ships of the two navies in his flotillas and squadrons so that after a few months they were all one navy. Although in his own service his reputation was that of a hard taskmaster with a brusque, intolerant manner, the American navy discovered a human side which led him to be known to most American sailors as Uncle Lewis. By the end of the war, he was as well known in the USA as in Britain. It was the joint practice of naval warfare that broadened and deepened into a sympathetic understanding between Bayly and Pringle and those who served under them, and this understanding spread further and helped increase friendship between the two English-speaking countries.<br>
<br>In 1921 Bayly, who had retired in July 1919, visited the USA as the guest of the Queenstown Association, a club formed by officers who had served under him from 1915 to 1918, and of which he was vice-president. In 1934 he was again the guest of the American navy when, at the naval academy at Annapolis, he unveiled a memorial, which the secretary of the navy had granted him permission to erect, to his American chief of staff, Vice-Admiral Pringle.<br>
<br>Bayly was appointed CVO in 1907, CB in 1912, KCB in 1914, and KCMG in 1918. He received the grand cross of the Dannebrog in 1912 and the American DSO. He died at his home, 68 Arlington House, St James's, London, on 16 May 1938. His volume of memoirs, <span class="italic">Pull Together!</span>, was published in 1939. A hard taskmaster, Bayly drove himself even harder than he drove his subordinates. His work with the Americans at Queenstown was an outstanding example of allied command in war, revealing the human side of a man the Americans referred to as &#145;Old Frozen Face&#146;  (Marder, 5.121&#150;2).<br>
