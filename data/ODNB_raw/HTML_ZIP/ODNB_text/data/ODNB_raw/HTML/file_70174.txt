<span class="headword">Croft,  (Noel) Andrew Cotton</span>  (1906&#150;1998), <span class="occ">army officer and Arctic explorer</span>, was born on 30 November 1906 at Abbey Cottage, Essex Road, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the only son and fourth child of the Revd Robert William Croft, curate of Stevenage, and his wife, Lottie Alice Bland Clayton. His father, a gentle, saintly man and a classical scholar, took a living in a remote hamlet on the Essex coast before becoming vicar of Kelvedon, and a canon of Chelmsford Cathedral. Croft attended two preparatory schools before going to Lancing College, where he was in the house of J. F. Roxburgh, who recognized his potential and took him with him as one of his senior pupils when he became first headmaster of Stowe School in 1923. He went to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1925, and took a pass degree in 1928. New interests, developed at Oxford, led to his working in Geneva with the American committee at the League of Nations in 1927. There he met the polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, and also Gustav Stresemann who had brought Germany into the league. Stresemann's right-hand man, Werner Kissling, became a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>Croft intended to go into the cotton trade, and studied at the Manchester School of Technology. But he spent a brief unhappy time in the textile industry in Carlisle until he was invited by the headmaster of Eton College to join his staff, provided that he first became fluent in German. He spent a year in Europe, learning German and French. Happening to be in Berlin on 28 February 1933, he was a witness to the Reichstag fire, and to the fact that the watching Brownshirts made no attempt to put it out. He taught briefly in a preparatory school, but in autumn 1933 he was invited to join Martin Lindsay's three-man expedition across Greenland. Croft put in much of the preparatory work in west Greenland, essential to the expedition's success, and he was principal dog-driver on what remains the longest self-supporting dog-sledge journey on record, at 1080 miles. The expedition crossed the ice cap in 1934, and mapped Greenland's highest mountains.<br>
<br>Croft spent 1934&#150;5 as aide-de-camp to the young maharaja of Cooch Bihar, before joining the Oxford University Arctic expedition to Nordaustland, the most northerly of the Spitsbergen group, as deputy leader under Alexander (Sandy) Glen. The team were all awarded the polar medal for the expedition, for their contributions to radar development by research on the ionosphere, and glaciological discoveries and survey. From 1937 to 1939 Croft was secretary to Louis Clarke, the director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and he accompanied an ethnographical expedition to Swedish Lapland in 1938. He published <span class="italic">Polar Exploration</span> in 1939.<br>
<br>His time in Germany had left Croft in no doubt that war was likely and from summer 1939 he was involved in the secret and intelligence organizations then being improvised. He was initially engaged in the War Office mission to the Finno-Soviet war, and then in attempts to frustrate the German invasion of Norway. He was in Bergen as the Germans invaded, and, in ordinary clothes, evaded them and walked over the mountains to Voss, eventually joining the evacuating British forces. With the rank of major, he was sent to Stockholm in 1941, ostensibly as an assistant military attach&eacute;, actually with the Special Operations Executive (SOE). From the Shetland Islands he undertook long-range reconnaissance flights to map the sea ice edge with Sandy Glen, in support of the north Russian convoys. In 1943 Croft was posted to the Mediterranean, to launch commando raids on Italy and the south of France, first from north Africa and then, after the fall of Italy, from Corsica, and to infiltrate SOE agents into occupied France. He personally led twenty-four sorties into enemy territory, and in 1944 parachuted into France to work with the resistance. He ended the war in Denmark, and was awarded the DSO.<br>
<br>After the war Croft was internationally recognized as an expert on cold-weather warfare, and on special operations more generally. He stayed with the army, and was attached to the Canadian Operation Musk Ox in 1945&#150;6, testing equipment in Canada's frozen northern territories, and to the north-west frontier trials in India in 1946&#150;7, where he witnessed the communal massacres after partition later that year. By now a lieutenant-colonel in the regular army, he served as liaison officer headquarters continental army in the United States (1952&#150;4). On 24 July 1952 he married Rosalind Madden, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Kantzow (1917/18&#150;1996); they had three daughters. A skilled soldier, and a perfectionist, Croft found other talents, during these years, in training and human development, especially with the young. In 1954 he took over and reorganized the boys' infantry battalion at Plymouth, transforming a hitherto dispirited unit with such success that in 1957 he was promoted colonel and commandant of the army apprentices school at Harrogate. He retired from the army in 1960, and was asked to create and run a training college for the Metropolitan Police at Hendon. He organized the college along public-school lines, and encouraged the cadets to take GCE examinations. It was, he said, the most exciting job he had taken on: &#145;parachuting had nothing on it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Independent</span>, 1 July 1998). He was appointed OBE in 1970, and retired in 1971 to his home, River House, 52 Strand-on-the-Green, Chiswick, where he and his wife entertained generously. He published his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Talent for Adventure</span>, in 1991. Andrew Croft died in Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham, on 26 June 1998.<br>
