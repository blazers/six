<span class="headword">Wycombe <span class="st"> [Wycumbe]</span>,  William  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1127&#150;<em>c.</em>1148), <span class="occ">prior of Llanthony and hagiographer</span>, was probably, as his name suggests, a native of Buckinghamshire. From an early age he was acquainted with Robert de B&eacute;thune (<i>d</i>. 1148), whose chaplain he had become by about 1127, while Robert was still prior of the Augustinian house of Llanthony in the lordship of Monmouth, Gwent. Probably William was also a canon at Llanthony, and he certainly had become one by 1132. Even after Robert became bishop of Hereford in 1131, William remained closely associated with him, and seems to have spent periods of time in his household, since he witnesses several of his charters. William became prior of Llanthony in 1137 on the death of the previous prior, Robert de Braci, Robert de B&eacute;thune's successor; by this time the canons had been driven from Wales by the Welsh uprising of 1135, and had been provided with a new home, at Llanthony Secunda just outside Gloucester, through the assistance of Robert de B&eacute;thune and Miles of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1143). William's last dated occurrence as prior is 16 July 1147; soon after this he was deposed by his fellow canons, angered by his strict discipline, with the encouragement of Llanthony's patron, Roger, earl of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1155), who had been displeased by a piece of writing by William, now lost, criticizing his father, Miles. William had been deposed before Robert de B&eacute;thune's departure for Rheims in March 1148, since he occurs without title in a charter of Robert issued between 1143 and 1148, while his successor Clement became prior in or before 1148. He moved to a cell of Llanthony at Frome where he spent the rest of his life. It was evidently here that he wrote his <span class="italic">Life of Robert de B&eacute;thune</span>, a hagiography presenting Robert as an ideal regular canon and pastor, which none the less failed to achieve Robert's canonization. One version was dedicated to Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1171), and another, only very slightly different, to Reginald, prior of Wenlock, who died in the mid-1150s. The date of William's own death is unknown.<br>
