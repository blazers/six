<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith,  Walter Parry  Haskett</span>  (1859&#150;1946), <span class="occ">rock climber</span>, was born at Bognor, Sussex, on 28 August 1859, the second son of Haskett Smith (1813&#150;1895), of Trowswell, Goudhurst, Kent, landowner and farmer, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies, formerly Britten (1819&#150;1893). He was educated at Eton College, where he enjoyed a reputation as both an athlete and a scholar of some promise, and read classics at Trinity College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship, graduating in 1882 with a third-class degree, an athletics blue, and the unofficial long-jump record (25.5 feet). He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1885, but appears never to have practised. Instead he relied on his private income to facilitate a life of travel and scholarly inquiry.<br>
<br>While still at Oxford, Haskett Smith visited first Snowdonia (in 1880) and then the Lake District (in 1881) as a member of reading parties. &#145;For eight hours in every day we absorbed Aristotle and Plato; for six or seven we scoured the surrounding fells&#146;  (&#145;Climbing in Cumberland&#146;, <span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>, 16, 1892, 143). At Wasdale Head in 1881 he encountered the barrister and fellow of Trinity F. H. Bowring (1823&#150;1917), who introduced him to some exciting scrambles, and in 1882 Haskett Smith returned with his younger brother Edmund to put up first ascents of routes on Pillar Rock above Ennerdale and Deep Ghyll on Scafell, among others.<br>
<br>At the time most British mountains were climbed by the route of least resistance: few sought out difficulty for its own sake. Some budding alpinists sought to hone their skills on snow and ice at home before putting them into practice in Switzerland, but the possibilities of climbing on rock were barely comprehended. Haskett Smith, in making solo ascents, and shunning the use of a rope (which he, in his early years, decried as &#145;illegitimate&#146;), was setting out on a different trajectory altogether. He devoted himself to domestic opportunities, and only after having revolutionized the profile of British rock climbing did he invest time and energy in more conventional alpinism (joining the Alpine Club in 1890). Initially there was some friction between more established alpinists such as William Cecil Slingsby and this remarkable &#145;outsider&#146;, but cordial relationships were swiftly established and the pair went on frequently to climb together.<br>
<br>In 1883 Haskett Smith walked with the great pioneer Charles Packe (1826&#150;1896) in the Pyrenees, but in 1884 he was back in the Lakes, making the acquaintance of another local mountaineer, J. W. Robinson (1853&#150;1907). He and Robinson reconnoitred Napes Needle, a remarkably iconic 70 foot rock spire (&#145;the Dent du G&eacute;ant of the Lake district;&#146; <span class="italic">Pall Mall Budget</span>, 5 June 1890) at the foot of Needle Ridge on Great Gable.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1886, snatching a few days in Cumberland between visits to Skye, Haskett Smith made a solo ascent of Napes Needle. By the end of the decade the Needle was being regularly climbed, and sketches and photographs of men and women atop this seemingly perilous pinnacle began to appear in the popular press. Napes Needle was not a summit, but it was a distinct challenge, and others followed Haskett Smith in seeking out similar tests of their athleticism and nerve. The sport of rock climbing, as distinct from mountaineering, had been launched.<br>
<br>Haskett Smith went on to make further first ascents, his 1891 north climb on Pillar (a route of 320 feet in length), his last great achievement, involving crawling over apparently unstable blocks of stone &#145;like a fly on sugar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Black and White</span>, 4 June 1892). In the main his accomplishments as a climber were swiftly surpassed by younger men, who prized balance above sheer physical strength. He largely climbed gully routes and ridges, rather than the faces that would attract later cohorts of climbers. &#145;He climbed for fun and his passion stopped well this side of obsession&#146;  (Hankinson, 98).<br>
<br>Haskett Smith's second major contribution to the development of British rock climbing was the publication of his <span class="italic">Climbing in the British Isles</span> (two vols., 1894, 1895). These were the first guidebooks to the climbing landscapes of Britain, and although a third volume proposing to deal with Scotland was never written they paved the way for other authors' more substantial volumes dealing with the Lake District and Snowdonia. Previously information had to be sought in books kept at the hotels favoured by climbers, or passed on by word of mouth. Haskett Smith enlisted the assistance of Albert Frederick Mummery for information on chalk cliffs, and the inclusion of such, alongside passages detailing the opportunities to be found on the Cornish coast, or down pot-holes, indicated that climbing was not to be restricted to Britain's mountain districts. The Irish section of the second volume was written by the Dublin botanist H. C. Hart (1847&#150;1908) while some of the research for material on Wales was carried out in the company of Owen Glynne Jones.<br>
<br>The volumes were both inspirational and idiosyncratic. Geoffrey Winthrop Young wrote that &#145;they were to many of us the first notice that such a domestic fairyland existed&#146;  (Young, 113). Taking the form of an alphabetical list they jumbled geographical information on crags and climbing technique alongside etymological, folkloristic, and historical discursions and grisly depictions of fatalities suffered by unwary visitors to the high fells. Haskett Smith's voracious appetite for knowledge and his somewhat unruly personality shone through, his descriptions leavened by wry humour. Bear Rock on Great Gable, he wrote, &#145;was gravely attacked [in 1889] by a large party comprising some five or six of the strongest climbers in England. It is a little difficult to find, especially in seasons when the grass is at all long&#146;  (<span class="italic">Climbing in the British Isles</span>, 1.6). Although they occupy an honoured place in climbing history the volumes' sales were modest.<br>
<br>Haskett Smith served as president of the Climbers' Club (1901&#150;3) and of the Fell and Rock Climbing Club (1913&#150;17), and twice served terms on the committee of the Alpine Club. He travelled widely, climbing and walking in Scotland, Wales, the Pyrenees, the Alps, Norway, Canada, north Africa, Greece, the Balkans, the West Indies, and the Andes. He published a number of articles (mainly of reminiscence) in the <span class="italic">Fell and Rock Climbing Club Journal</span>, and warm obituaries of his friends in the <span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Haskett Smith's range of interests were far wider than rock climbing alone. He was a keen philologist, genealogist, amateur archaeologist, and antiquarian. As a liveryman of the Fishmongers' Company he rose to become prime warden (1915&#150;16) and produced (in 1916) <span class="italic">Lists of Apprentices and Freemen</span> [of the company] <span class="italic">in 1537 and 1600&#150;50</span>. Although he rarely returned to the Lakes after the First World War he remained a keen, often eccentrically dressed, rambler of the home counties.<br>
<br>Haskett Smith's fitness was proven for a final time when, in 1936, at the age of seventy-six, and in front of 300 members of the Fell and Rock Climbing Club, he made a &#145;jubilee&#146; ascent of Napes Needle to mark the fiftieth anniversary of his original solo climb, having the previous day climbed Pillar Rock.<br>
<br>Shortly after this episode Haskett Smith's strength began to fail and his health deteriorated. Never having married, he shared a flat in Kensington for many years with his sister, but bomb damage during the Second World War forced him to move to Parkstone in Dorset, where he lived with one of his brothers. He died at the Duncliffe nursing home, Parkstone, Poole, on 11 March 1946.<br>
<br>Haskett Smith was strongly individualistic. To Young his appearance (balding, with long moustaches) was &#145;not unlike that of some Chinese philosopher&#151;of exceptional physique&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>, 1946, 417). A widely read man who rarely stopped talking when in the hills or even on the rocks, he is primary claimant to the title of &#145;the Father of British rock-climbing&#146;  (Kelly and Doughty, 28).<br>
