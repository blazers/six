<span class="headword">O'Shea,  John Augustus</span>  (1839&#150;1905), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 24 June 1839 at Nenagh, co. Tipperary. His father was John O'Shea, a well-known journalist, who worked for the <span class="italic">Clonmel Guardian</span>. After receiving his elementary education in Nenagh, O'Shea was sent on 31 October 1856 to the Catholic University in Dublin. In 1859 he went to London to work as a journalist. He became a special correspondent to various newspapers. In 1860 he represented an American journal at the siege of Ancona, defended by the papal troops, and he described part of the Austro-Prussian War. Settling in Paris he acted for some time as a correspondent of Richard Pigott's <span class="italic">Irishman</span> newspaper. For this paper, and for <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span>, a magazine also owned by Pigott, O'Shea wrote many of his best stories and sketches, especially the <span class="italic">Memoirs of a White Cravat</span> (1868). His usual signature was the Irish Bohemian. In 1869 he joined the London <span class="italic">Standard</span>, and for twenty-five years was one of its most active special correspondents. He reported the Franco-Prussian War, when he was captured by the French and nearly executed as a spy. He was in the siege of Paris, and in Spain during the Carlist War of 1872, and reported the famine in Bengal in 1877. After leaving <span class="italic">The Standard</span> he continued to write occasional articles in various English and Irish papers, including the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> and the Dublin <span class="italic">Evening Telegraph</span>. He was a long-standing member of the staff of <span class="italic">The Universe</span>, a Roman Catholic paper published in London.<br>
<br>In 1885 he became president of the Southwark Irish Literary Club, an important centre for the Gaelic revival in London. He was injured in a traffic accident, which left him paralysed in his last years. He died in poverty at his home in Jeffreys Road, Clapham, on 13 March 1905, and was buried in Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery, on 18 March. He was twice married, his second wife and a daughter surviving him.<br>
<br>O'Shea's admirable sense of style, and his dash and wit, distinguish his writing. His contemporaries described him as the last of the bohemian journalists. His books are, in the main, made up of articles written during his working life. He was a witty conversationalist and raconteur, and an admirable public speaker.<br>
