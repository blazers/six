<span class="headword">Audley,  Hugh</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">moneylender</span>, was baptized on 13 January 1577 at St Michael, Wood Street, London, the tenth of the eleven children of John Audley (<i>d</i>. 1577?), mercer, and his wife, Maudlin or Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1594), daughter of John Hare of London, mercer, and a kinswoman of the first Baron Coleraine. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1603, and in the following year obtained the reversion of a clerkship of the court of wards and liveries, in which his maternal uncle was a protonotary. He is alleged to have paid &pound;3000 for his position  (<span class="italic">Way to be Rich</span>, 12), which he exploited systematically for his personal gain. A close colleague, whose career in the court was exactly contemporaneous with Audley's, and who dedicated himself scrupulously to his duty, died in poverty; Audley became &#145;infinitely rich&#146;, rich enough to afford the loss of more than &pound;100,000, which he is said to have suffered by the suppression of the court in 1646  (ibid., 17). Years after this took place, moneys due to the court, and its records, were still in his keeping.<br>
<br>Audley's practice as a moneylender was extensive: at his death he was owed at least &pound;30,000. He also invested in land, notably the manor of Ebury, in Westminster. He bought this cheaply from Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex (1575&#150;1645), who was in debt and desperate for money, after prolonged negotiations in 1625&#150;6, in which he was described as &#145;barbarous&#146;, a man whose &#145;looks show his disposition&#146;, and one who bore himself &#145;loftily, respectless and peremptory&#146;  (Prestwich, 479f.). After Audley's death, the estate passed by inheritance to his great-grandniece Mary Davies, wife of Sir Thomas Grosvenor, whose descendants it was to enrich: Audley Street, which runs through it, is named after Hugh Audley. When Audley took advantage of the financial distress of another landowner to buy land at Buckenham in Norfolk, he appears to have withheld payments which he had promised, and to have harassed one of his creditors with vexatious suits.<br>
<br>The anonymous author of <span class="italic">The Way to be Rich, According to the Practice of the Great Audley</span> wrote that Audley lived:<blockquote>a life of intricacies and misteries, wherein he walked as in a maze; and went on as in a labyrinth with the clue of a resolved mind, which made plaine to him all the rough passages he met with; he with a round and solid mind fashioned his own fate, fixed and unmoveable in the great tumults and stir of business, the hard <i>Rocke</i> in the middest of Waves.</blockquote>This pamphlet is not altogether reliable, and was attacked in apologetic discussions of Audley's career by Gatty and Reade, but the &#145;intricacies&#146; of his dealings, and the trouble and sorrow they brought to the men and women from whom he profited, are well attested. He died on 15 November 1662 at the house of the rector of St Clement Danes, in Milford Lane, London, and was buried on 21 November at the Temple Church.<br>
