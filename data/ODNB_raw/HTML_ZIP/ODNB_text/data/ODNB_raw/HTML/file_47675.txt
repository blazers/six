<span class="headword">Ranade,  Mahadev Govind</span>  (1842&#150;1901), <span class="occ">judge and Indian nationalist</span>, was born in Niphad in the Bombay presidency on 18 January 1842, the first of two surviving children of Govindrao Amrita Ranade (<i>d</i>. 1877), head clerk in a district office in the Nasik district of the Bombay presidency, and later administrative officer in Kolhapur state, and his first wife, Gopikabai (<i>d</i>. 1853). He had two surviving half-brothers from his father's second marriage.<br>
<br>Although an apparently indifferent scholar at the Kolhapur English school (1851&#150;6) he performed brilliantly at the Elphinstone Institution in Bombay (1857) and the Elphinstone College (1858&#150;62) of the new University of Bombay. He graduated BA in 1862 and won a gold medal in history and economics, and became the university's first MA in 1864. He passed his LLB with first-class honours in 1866 and his advocates' examination in 1871. From 1860 to 1863 he had been junior fellow in the college, and senior fellow and assistant professor of history and English from 1868 to 1871. He entered the Bombay government's education department as acting Marathi translator in 1866 while obtaining his advocate's qualifications, and began his judicial career in 1871 as third presidency judge in Bombay. After a variety of positions he became first-class judge in Poona in 1873 until he was transferred under a political cloud to Nasik (1878) and Dhulia (1879). He became additional presidential magistrate in Bombay in 1881, judge of the small cases court in Poona (1884), special judge under the <span class="roman">Deccan Ryots' Relief Act</span> (1887), and was judge of the Bombay high court from 1893 until his death in 1901. He served on the Bombay legislative council (1885&#150;6, 1890&#150;01, and 1893&#150;4) and was a member of the finance commission from 1886 to 1887, for which he was created CIE.<br>
<br>Ranade profoundly shaped the intellectual and political discourses of the day. He edited the English columns of a Bombay Anglo-Marathi daily, the <span class="italic">Indu Prakash</span> (1864&#150;71), and from 1878 guided and wrote much of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha</span>, a Poona-based association which he was instrumental in founding in 1870. Through a reinterpretation of Maratha history, <span class="italic">Rise of the Maratha Power</span> (1900), and numerous essays, many initially presented as public addresses, he argued for a social, political, economic, and moral regeneration of the Indian people, achievable through a rethinking of Indian values, much as he saw the protestant Reformation as having transformed Europe. In the contours of his thought he prefigured a Weberian view of the interrelationship between value systems and societal development.<br>
<br>Ranade also fought for change. He participated in a reform movement to permit Hindu widows to remarry, which culminated in a debate in 1870 between reformers and religious conservatives, resulting in the reformers' defeat. His reinterpretation of Hinduism on theist lines was expressed through the Prarthana Samaj (&#145;prayer society&#146;), founded in 1867. Ranade and the Samaj tried to influence Hindu society from within, rather than moving outside it as a marginalized reform sect. He promoted the development of Indian industries and the use of Indian-made goods through his writings and the convening of industrial conferences in the 1890s. He was most influential politically during the 1870s in the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha's campaigns to educate Indian opinion and organize opposition against government measures, such as its land revenue policies and its inept handling of the disastrous Deccan famine crisis of the late 1870s. Suspected by the government of complicity in the rural and political unrest in the late 1870s, he was transferred from Poona to lessen his influence. Of necessity as a judge he worked from behind the scenes. He played a critical role in the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885 and in guiding its subsequent deliberations, though he did not participate in its public sessions. In 1887 he established the Indian National Social Conference to promote social reform but, since the meetings were held immediately after the Congress and in its tent, the conference also enabled his attendance at Congress sessions. In 1895 conservative Hindus, led by B. G. Tilak, opposed the reformers and broke the link between Congress and conference. The following year Ranade lost control of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and formed the Deccan Sabha to maintain his political approach.<br>
<br>Ranade's indirect tactics derived partly from judicial exigencies but may have been equally the product of his physical persona: he was large and ungainly, socially inept and diffident. His stand on social reform had been compromised after the death of his first wife, Sakubai Dandekar, whom he had married in 1854. Within a month of her death in 1873 he bowed to pressure from his father and remarried. His new wife, Ramabai Kurlekar (<i>d</i>. 1924), was then eleven years old. His allies on the issue of the remarriage of widows were annoyed that he had not married a widow, and his ability to influence social reform debates was thereby reduced. He taught Ramabai to read and write English, and after his death, from a heart attack, on 16 January 1901 in Bombay, she became an important social reformer and public figure in her own right. There were no children from either marriage. Ranade was cremated and his ashes were spread at the Triveni at Allahabad.<br>
