</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Combe,  Thomas</span>  (1796&#150;1872), <span class="occ">printer and patron of the arts</span>, was born on 21 July 1796 in Leicester, the second of six children of Thomas Combe, the town's leading bookseller, and his wife, Theodosia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dalby). He had an older sister, three younger sisters, and a younger brother. He was educated at Repton School, Derby, which he entered in August 1808.<br>
<br>After Repton, Combe worked in his father's bookshop, and then moved to Oxford about 1824 to assist Joseph Parker in his new bookshop in the Turl. He lived in St Mary Hall Lane with one of his sisters, who kept lodgings. Here Combe met John Henry Newman and Edward Pusey, who lodged, briefly, in the house. Two years later Combe went into partnership with Michael Angelo Nattali, in a bookselling business at 24 Tavistock Street, London, but within a year or so he left for Leicester to take a share in his father's bookselling and printing business at Gallowtree Gate.<br>
<br>In 1838 Combe joined the university press at Oxford, which was then made up of two quite separate businesses: the learned side, which printed classical texts; and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> side, which was a commercial enterprise exploiting the university's monopoly (shared with Cambridge and the queen's printer) in the printing of <span class="roman">Bibles</span> and prayer books. Combe began as superintendent of the learned side, a salaried post bringing a comfortable income of &pound;450 a year. He lived in North House, one of two conjoined managers' houses in the quadrangle of the press buildings, in Walton Street, Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>After returning to Oxford, Combe renewed his acquaintanceship with Newman and through him met Martha Edwards [<a name="cosubject_59012"></a><span class="headword">Martha Howell Bennett Combe</span>  (1806&#150;1893)<span class="occ"></span>], one of five daughters of John Edwards, an ironmonger with premises in the High Street. Combe married her on 3 September 1840, Newman officiating at the ceremony. They had no children. Throughout their married life they were strong supporters of the Tractarian movement.<br>
<br>In 1841 Combe bought shares in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> business at the university press and gradually increased his holding until, in 1851, he became senior partner. He relinquished his post on the learned side to take full control of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> business. Output and profits rose under his management; by 1853 he was receiving nearly &pound;4000 a year in dividends, almost ten times what he had been paid for his services on the learned side. He was now a rich man. The university benefited immensely from the dividends and in 1859 conferred on Combe the honorary degree of MA in recognition of his business achievements and for furthering the interests of employees. &#145;Before his coming to Oxford the University chest had been &hellip; in a sick and dying condition&#146;, the public orator announced at the ceremony; &#145;by his honourable exertions and ceaseless labours [Combe] has revived, upheld, supported, and enlarged that chest&#146;  (OUP archives). This was not strictly true, as the press had been profitable before his arrival. Moreover, although Combe was a shrewd and energetic manager, the prosperity of the press in the 1850s was as much a product of a booming economy, and an unprecedented demand for <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, as it was of his own efforts. Combe relished the award: one observer recorded seeing him around the press in later life &#145;with his white beard and hair set off by a Magdalen blazer, under his MA gown&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendonian</span>, 23, 1969, 39).<br>
<br>In 1850 Combe met the young Pre-Raphaelite painters John Everett Millais and Charles Allston Collins, who were painting near Oxford. Impressed by the boyish charm of Millais, the Combes invited them to stay at their house, where Millais painted a portrait of Thomas Combe, and Collins one of Mrs Combe's uncle, William Bennett. Thanks mainly to the persuasive powers of Millais, Combe began to acquire Pre-Raphaelite paintings: William Holman Hunt's <span class="italic">A Converted British Family</span> in 1850, and Millais's <span class="italic">The Return of the Dove to the Ark</span> and Collins's <span class="italic">Convent Thoughts</span> in 1851. These were acquired at a time when Pre-Raphaelite paintings were being savaged by the critics, and the survival of the movement owed much to Combe's patronage.<br>
<br>The Combes met Hunt in 1851 and invited him to Oxford. It was the first of many visits: &#145;Hunt saw little of his family now,&#146; his granddaughter wrote later, &#145;the Combes had taken their place&#146;  (D. H. Hunt, <span class="italic">My Grandfather, his Wives and Loves</span>, 1987, 92). In 1853 Combe bought Hunt's <span class="italic">The Light of the World</span>, perhaps the most famous of all Victorian paintings, for 400 guineas. Other paintings bought from Hunt include <span class="italic">The School-Girl's Hymn</span> (1860) and a small version of <span class="italic">The Afterglow in Egypt</span> (1861). Combe bought just one painting by Rossetti: <span class="italic">Dante Drawing an Angel</span>, purchased in 1855.<br>
<br>Combe provided &pound;3000 for a new chapel at the Radcliffe Infirmary. It was designed by Arthur Blomfield and completed in 1865. To meet the need of the growing population of Jericho, where the press was situated, Combe was also responsible for providing the church of St Barnabas. Again designed by Blomfield, this was completed in 1869 at a cost of &pound;6500, and the church's Tractarian furnishings and rituals soon attracted huge congregations.<br>
<br>Working at the press until the last, Thomas Combe died suddenly of angina on 29 October 1872. A request, supported by the prime minister, Gladstone, that Combe should, exceptionally, be interred within the walls of St Barnabas, was turned down by the home secretary, and he was buried in St Sepulchre's cemetery in Walton Street on 6 November 1872.<br>
<br>Combe's wife, Martha, lived on at the press building until her death in 1893. With one or two exceptions, she bequeathed all the Pre-Raphaelite paintings&#151;which had been augmented by acquisitions of her own (notably Hunt's <span class="italic">London Bridge by Night</span>)&#151;to the university, which placed them in the Ashmolean Museum. The major exception was Hunt's <span class="italic">The Light of the World</span>, which she had already given to Keble College. The collection was one of the most comprehensive private collections of early Pre-Raphaelite art. Martha Combe died on 27 December 1893. She was buried at St Sepulchre's, beside her husband, on 2 January 1894.<br>
