<span class="headword">Payne,  Humfry Gilbert Garth</span>  (1902&#150;1936), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born at Wendover, Buckinghamshire, on 19 February 1902, the only son of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35421/', "Edward John Payne (1844&#150;1904)")</script> and his wife, Emma Leonora Helena Pertz, granddaughter of Georg Heinrich Pertz (editor of the <span class="roman">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</span>) and of James John Garth Wilkinson, the Swedenborgian. He was educated at Westminster School and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he held an open classical scholarship and gained firsts in classical moderations (1922) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1924). In his last year at Oxford, partly under the influence of J. D. Beazley and Alan Blakeway, he became seriously interested in Greek art and found his vocation as an archaeologist.<br>
<br>After taking his degree Payne continued his studies as university research scholar in Mediterranean archaeology (1924&#150;6). In 1926 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58012/', "(Elizabeth) Dilys Powell (1901&#150;1995)")</script>, daughter of Thomas Powell, a bank manager of Bridgnorth and Bournemouth; there were no children. She had read modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford (1920&#150;24), and retained the name Dilys Powell in her career as journalist and film and television critic. In the same year Payne was appointed as assistant in the coin room (then part of the department of antiquities) of the Ashmolean Museum, a position he held until 1928. This gave him the opportunity to work with his former teacher, Beazley, and together they published a selection of Attic black-figured pottery from earlier excavations at Naucratis in the <span class="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</span> (1929). Payne was a senior scholar of Christ Church (1926&#150;31). He was awarded the Conington prize for classical learning in 1927 based on his submission of his work on the painted pottery and other arts at Corinth. In 1931 this was to be published as <span class="italic">Necrocorinthia</span>, which placed Payne at once, as was widely acknowledged, in the front rank of classical archaeologists. It was supplemented in 1933 by <span class="italic">Protokorinthische Vasenmalerei</span>.<br>
<br>Payne was at this stage linked with excavations on Crete. He excavated in the vicinity of Knossos in 1927 and 1929, concentrating on the post-Bronze Age remains rather than the &#145;Minoan&#146; period which had been the focus of the work by Sir Arthur Evans. Payne was to resume excavations in the Fortetsa cemetery in 1933, supported by funds raised in Oxford by Alan Blakeway. Excavations in the cemetery continued in 1935; the archaeological report, <span class="italic">Fortetsa: Early Greek Tombs Near Knossos</span>, was published by James Brock, one of the excavators, in 1957. Payne had been hoping to develop a major excavation of an archaic site on Crete. In June 1929 he started work at Eleutherna in central Crete, a site earlier surveyed by P. J. Dixon, but the finds were disappointing and the work abandoned.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1929 Payne took up residence as the newly appointed director of the British School of Athens. He then initiated the excavation of Perachora, a small but rich archaic site opposite Corinth, over four seasons from 1930 to 1933. The first volume of <span class="italic">Perachora</span>, edited by Thomas James Dunbabin, was published in 1940; most of it is by Payne. The second volume was to follow in 1962. One of his chief works as director was the publication of <span class="italic">Archaic Marble Sculpture from the Acropolis</span> (1936: a volume of photographs by Gerard Mackworth Young with text by Payne). This continued the British School's involvement with the publication of material from the Athenian acropolis initiated during R. M. Dawkins's directorship. Payne's volume set many statues and fragments in fresh light: two notable identifications were the matching of the upper part of a female statue in Lyons with its base on the acropolis, and the association of a head in the Louvre with an equestrian statue also in Athens. His former teacher, Beazley, described the particular qualities of his work: &#145;A fine eye, deep respect for the individual object, great structural power, wealth of detail combined with breadth of vision, perfect clearness of thought and expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He died at the Evangelismos Hospital in Athens from a staphylococcic infection, which had suddenly become acute, on 9 May 1936. He was buried in the cemetery of Ayios Yeoryios at Mycenae, and his gravestone is inscribed, &#145;Weep not for Adonis&#146;.<br>
<br>Payne was described as &#145;6 feet 5 inches in height, straight, slender, square-shouldered, with a small head, and small features (except the mouth), fair hair, a fresh complexion, eyes of a strong blue, and something boyish, yet resolute, in the face&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His widow wrote a good account of him, especially of his life in Greece, in <span class="italic">The Traveller's Journey is done</span> (1943).<br>
