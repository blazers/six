<span class="headword">Weld,  Charles Richard</span>  (1813&#150;1869), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born at Windsor in August 1813, eldest son and only surviving child of Isaac Weld (<i>d</i>. 1824) and his second wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1834), daughter of Eyre Powell of Great Connell, Kildare. The Welds claimed descent from an ancient Catholic family of Dorset, through the protestant convert and American pioneer Thomas Weld (1595&#150;1661). This branch of the family possessed considerable estates in Ireland, where Charles's father held a lucrative government appointment, agreeably surrounded by educated and influential men. Charles was named for his father's friendship with Charles James Fox. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28984/', "Isaac Weld (1774&#150;1856)")</script>, son of Isaac's first marriage, to Elizabeth Kerr, was already well known in literary and scientific circles and had written of his travels in North America before Charles was born.<br>
<br>From 1820 Charles Weld and his parents resided in a ch&acirc;teau near Dijon for several years and on their return they settled in north Wales. After his father died, Charles lodged with Isaac at Ravenswell, near Dublin, sharing his circle of associates and attending classes at Trinity College, without taking a degree. He also stayed on the Isle of Wight with a married half-sister; on one such occasion, running on the pier at Ryde, he fell and damaged his spine, to which accident he attributed his later stoop. In 1836 he went on the grand tour of the continent with John Potter, and thereafter he generally spent two months each year touring in Britain or abroad. His positions in later life admitted him to all manner of libraries and institutions on the continent.<br>
<br>Weld moved to London and in 1839 took employment as secretary to the Statistical Society. He contributed several papers to the society's journal and compiled the <span class="italic">Statistical Companion to the Pocket Book</span> (1843), which went through many editions; the companions for 1848 and 1850 were compiled jointly with Thomas Collins Banfield, who was sole compiler of those for 1852 and 1854. In 1842 he married Anne, daughter of Henry Selwood, of an old Berkshire family; they had one daughter, Agnes Grace (<i>b</i>. 1849). This marriage bonded him into other influential circles. His wife was a niece of Sir John Franklin, the Arctic explorer; her elder sister Emily was married to Alfred Tennyson and her younger sister Louisa to Charles Tennyson. Weld studied law at the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1844, but he had succumbed to the attractions of science and, with the help of Sir John Barrow, in December 1843 he was appointed assistant secretary and librarian to the Royal Society, where he drew a salary of &pound;200, with accommodation on the society's premises. Despite his lowly status, he was invited to dine with the Royal Society Club in the 1844/5 session as the guest of Sir John Franklin.<br>
<br>The Royal Society at this time was in a fever for reform and Weld was frequently asked for details concerning its past organization. Encouraged by Dr Peter Mark Roget, its then secretary, Weld decided to compile an administrative history, a task which, as he pursued his researches well beyond the society's archives, absorbed four years of his spare time. The two volumes, published in 1848, with illustrations by his wife, combined accuracy with style and were well received. Weld had demolished the myth surrounding the society's mace, erroneously said to be that which Cromwell had ordered to be removed from the House of Commons, although <span class="italic">The Athenaeum's</span> reviewer took exception to Weld's version of the gossip surrounding Newton's patrons.<br>
<br>Weld proved a diligent servant, bringing order to the society's library and compiling a list of its portraits. His annual tours, unaccompanied by his wife and daughter, generated a series of travel books, beginning in 1850 with Auvergne, Piedmont, and Savoy, extending to North America in 1854, and eventually including Scotland, Ireland, and other parts of western Europe. His relationship with Sir John and Jane Franklin led him to lecture and write on Arctic travel and, after Franklin's disappearance, on the search for Franklin's expedition.<br>
<br>In March 1861 Weld left the Royal Society, as a consequence of having introduced a lady to his rooms at Burlington House. His explanation, that &#145;she was of independent fortune&#146;, cut no ice. The affair was disguised by Sir Edward Sabine and Sir George Stokes, who compelled Weld to tender his resignation to the Society's council &#145;for family reasons&#146;. Wishing him to depart immediately, Sabine and Stokes reluctantly decided to pay his salary to the end of the year.<br>
<br>In his later years Weld became a partner in a publishing business with Lovell Reeve (<i>d</i>. 1865). He enjoyed poetry, especially that of his brother-in-law Alfred Tennyson, and himself wrote verse. He liked dogs, and almost always had one by him, even in town. He was happiest when fishing in some rural stream. In 1862 he was appointed a district superintendent of the international exhibition held in London, responsible for the organization of the philosophical instruments section, which he reported on for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. He represented Great Britain at the Paris Exhibition of 1867 and, while there, made the acquaintance of a friend who invited him to Burgundy the following year. This provided material for his last book, which his wife edited after his death. From 1865 he had lived near Bath, Somerset, and had been active in the Bath Literary and Philosophical Association. Weld died suddenly at his home, Belle Vue House, Newbridge Hill, Bath, on 15 January 1869.<br>
