<span class="headword">Wortley,  Edward James  Montagu-Stuart-</span>  (1857&#150;1934), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 31 July 1857, the second son of Francis Dudley Montagu-Stuart-Wortley (1829&#150;1893) and his wife, Maria Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin (<i>d</i>. 26 Sept 1891), the eldest daughter of William Bennet Martin of Worsborough Hall, Yorkshire. As the grandson of John, second baron Wharncliffe (1801&#150;1855), he was heir presumptive to the earldom. The family was known for its wealth, and sporting and social rather than political influence.<br>
<br>After Eton (1866&#150;70), Stuart-Wortley joined the army via the militia, and was gazetted to the King's Royal Rifle Corps (ensign, October 1877; lieutenant, March 1880). He first experienced action with the Kurram field force in the Second Anglo-Afghan war in 1879, and was mentioned in dispatches. He also served in the ill-fated Transvaal campaign of 1881. In 1882 he was military secretary to General Valentine Baker in Egypt, then aide-de-camp to Sir Evelyn Wood, and fought at Tell al-Kebir (13 September 1882). He served on Wolseley's Gordon relief expedition (1884&#150;5) and was involved in the final dash for Khartoum in the vain attempt to save General Gordon.<br>
<br>In 1886 Stuart-Wortley entered staff college by nomination and after graduation was posted to Malta, where he served three years as an infantry brigade major (captain, March 1886). On 5 February 1891, while serving in Malta, he married Violet Hunter, daughter of James Alexander Guthrie of Craigie, Dundee. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Created CMG in 1896, Stuart-Wortley returned to Egypt to serve on the staff of the sirdar, Francis, Lord Grenfell. He served in Kitchener's reconquest of the Sudan, and at the battle of Omdurman (2 September 1898) for his spirited and successful command of &#145;friendly&#146; irregulars, Stuart-Wortley was awarded the DSO. Almost immediately he was appointed assistant adjutant-general to Sir Redvers Buller and served on his staff during the South African campaign until the relief of Ladysmith (28 February 1900) when he was given command of the 2nd battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps.<br>
<br>Unusually for an officer of comparatively junior rank (major, brevet lieutenant-colonel) Stuart-Wortley was in 1901 appointed military attach&eacute; in Paris. This reflected not only his successful army career but also his wealth and social and diplomatic acumen. The new king, Edward VII, who, like his mother, took a particular interest in military matters, wrote encouraging the new attach&eacute; &#145;to devote all his good will to maintaining the most cordial relations with the French Army&#146;  (Rennell Rodd, p. 298). Edward's personal gratification with Stuart-Wortley's conduct in the successful negotiations for the Anglo-French entente was expressed by his creation as MVO in 1903. In 1906 Stuart-Wortley was made an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and appointed CB. He was given the substantive rank of colonel and in April 1908 command of the 10th infantry brigade.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1908, at the height of an anti-German campaign in the British navalist press, Stuart-Wortley published in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> an &#145;interview&#146; with the Kaiser. This, his only incursion into popular journalism, unwittingly earned Stuart-Wortley notoriety. (The choice of the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> was significant because, unlike the rest of the Unionist press, it treated stories on Germany and its Kaiser with restraint, even sympathy.) In December 1907, after completing an official visit to Britain, the Kaiser was for a fortnight Stuart-Wortley's private guest at his New Forest mansion, Highcliffe Castle, Christchurch, Hampshire. Stuart-Wortley had been impressed by Wilhelm's frequent and apparently heartfelt expressions of amity and respect for all things British. Stuart-Wortley supposed that if the public could be made aware of the Kaiser's true opinions, this would improve Anglo-German relations. He had proposed that the Kaiser give an interview to the journalist W. T. Stead, but Wilhelm refused. Stuart-Wortley believed he might overcome the Kaiser's aversion if he rather than a professional journalist conducted the interview, and his friend Harry Lawson, son of the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span>'s owner, encouraged this idea. Stuart-Wortley wrote down, as best he could recall, Wilhelm's conversations with him at Highcliffe, to which he added observations the Kaiser had made to him in September at the German army manoeuvres at Saarbr&uuml;cken. All was dictated to J. B. Firth, a <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> journalist, and his transcript was submitted to the Kaiser for approval.<br>
<br>The text was not carefully examined by German officials before it was approved, with only minor alterations. When it was published in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> on 28 October 1908, the interview did not create the hoped-for impression. The Kaiser's frequent interventions in diplomatic affairs, by speech or letter, not uncommonly created unintended crises. On this occasion the Kaiser's mixture of na&iuml;ve, boastful, and sometimes false assertions so carefully collected by Stuart-Wortley, in Germany and Britain alike, prompted embarrassment, amusement, and outrage. The anti-German scare in parliament and the press was exacerbated, while Stuart-Wortley's chagrin was only partly assuaged by the Kaiser's award of the Prussian Red Eagle and Star, second class.<br>
<br>A year after being promoted major-general in March 1913, Stuart-Wortley was given command of the north midland territorial division. In March 1915 this was the first complete territorial division to cross to France, and in May it was retitled the 46th (north midland) division. It served on the western front, held a dangerous part of the Ypres salient with heavy casualties, and in October, during the battle of Loos, attacked the Hohenzollern redoubt, again with heavy losses.<br>
<br>In 1916, as part of 7 corps in General Sir Edmund Allenby's Third Army, the 46th division was ordered to attack the village of Gommecourt on the extreme left (north) of the front as a diversion to the main Somme offensive, to capture the salient, and then to meet counter-attacks and inflict heavy casualties. On 1 July, after an inadequate artillery bombardment, 46th division met uncut wire and heavy fire, and their attack failed, with heavy casualties. Immediately after the battle Allenby ordered a court of inquiry into the handling of 46th division, which first sat on 4 July. Before it had completed its investigations, on the morning of 5 July, Stuart-Wortley was relieved of his command and ordered back to England, the first general to lose his command in the battle of the Somme. Most agreed that he was a poor commander. Brigadier-General Frank Lyon (chief staff officer, 7 corps) wrote that he was &#145;a worn-out man, who never visited his front line and was incapable of inspiring any enthusiasm&#146;  (Middlebrook, 284). According to Sir James Edmonds, he was sacked not so much for his Gommecourt failure, but because Haig was jealous of his correspondence with the king. His dismissal seems to have been the result of a combination of his poor reputation, the desire for a scapegoat, and Haig's dislike.<br>
<br>Later in 1916 Stuart-Wortley was sent to Ireland to command the 65th division. This command grew heavier, more thankless, and harassing. He left Ireland in March 1918, received no further wartime employment, and retired in July 1919. Indulging his love of sport and travel, he enjoyed an energetic retirement. He died in Tangier, Morocco, on 19 March 1934.<br>
<br>Stuart-Wortley, known by his friends as Eddie, reportedly enjoyed widespread popularity, both at court and in the mess and servants' hall. His army career, begun with such bright promise, faded disappointingly. Like other gallant, late-Victorian army officers brought up in quite other traditions, he apparently found life after the South African War less congenial in the reformed, more professional British army.<br>
