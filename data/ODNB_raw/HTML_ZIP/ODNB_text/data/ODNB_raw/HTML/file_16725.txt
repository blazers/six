<span class="headword">Lines,  Samuel</span>  (1778&#150;1863), <span class="occ">designer and art teacher</span>, was born at Allesley, near Coventry, on 7 February 1778, the son of John Lines (1746/7&#150;1831) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rostill (1739/40&#150;1787). His mother was mistress of a boarding-school in the town. On his mother's death in his boyhood he was placed in the charge of an uncle, a farmer, who employed him in agricultural work. Lines, however, managed to teach himself the rudiments of drawing and painting, and in 1794 he was apprenticed to Mr Keeling, a clock-dial enameller and decorator of Birmingham, for whom he worked as designer. He was employed in a similar capacity by Mr Clay, a papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; maker, and also by the die-engravers Wyon and Halliday. Among other objects he was frequently employed to design presentation shovels and swords of state, manufactured by Mr Gunby of Birmingham, a great amateur of art, with a fine private collection, and Gunby's gallery was freely open to Lines, as well as to his contemporary David Cox the elder. In 1807 Lines began to teach drawing in Birmingham, using casts to draw from; he set up a school in Newhall Street, met with success, and was able to build himself a house in Temple Row West, where he resided for the remainder of his life. In 1809 Lines, with Moses Haughton the elder, Charles Barber, John Vincent Barber, and other artists established a life academy in Peck Lane, New Street, which moved in 1814 to larger premises in Union Passage. It was in this room that the first exhibition of the works of Birmingham artists was held in 1814. Lines took a large share in the foundation of the Birmingham School of Art in 1821, and on the subsequent foundation of the Birmingham Society of Artists he was elected treasurer and curator, holding those offices until he reached the age of eighty, when he resigned, and was elected an honorary member. Nearly all the artists of the neighbourhood and many from other parts of the country received instruction in drawing at Lines's academy. A good landscape painter himself, he possessed a gift for teaching others, and many of his pupils attained much excellence. A privately printed autobiography, <span class="italic">A Few Incidents in the Life of Samuel Lines</span>, appeared in 1862. He died at his home in Temple Row West, Birmingham, on 22 November 1863, and was buried at St Philip's churchyard, Birmingham. An oil portrait of him by W. T. Roden and his drawing <span class="italic">Llyn Idwal</span>, are in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. He very rarely exhibited out of Birmingham.<br>
<br>Lines had five sons, all of whom made careers in art: Henry Harris Lines (1800/1801&#150;1889), a landscape artist who settled at Worcester, where he also pursued antiquarian interests; William Rostill Lines (1802&#150;1846), a modeller; <a href="#cosubject_16725">Samuel Rostill Lines [<i>see below</i>]</a>; Edward Ashcroft Lines (1806&#150;1875), who emigrated to Auckland, New Zealand; and Frederick Thomas Lines (1807&#150;1898), a portraitist.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16725"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Rostill Lines</span>  (1804&#150;1833), <span class="occ">painter</span>, third son of Samuel Lines, was born at Birmingham on 15 January 1804, and was taught drawing and painting by his father. He showed some skill in sketching trees, and was employed to make lithographed drawings for drawing books. He also specialized in views of picturesque buildings such as Haddon Hall. He was an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy and with the New Society of Painters in Water Colours and showed much promise. He died at his father's house in Birmingham on 9 November 1833, aged twenty-nine. Examples of his work are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and Maidstone Museum, Kent. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery holds a small collection of his pencil drawings of regional landscapes.<br>
