<span class="headword">Hood,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1721&#150;1784), <span class="occ">land surveyor</span>, was born at Moyle, co. Donegal. He was the first known in a family of land surveyors active in the north-west of Ireland in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In 1772 he published in Dublin his <span class="italic">Table of Difference of Latitude and Departure for Navigators, Land Surveyors, &amp;c.</span>, which he had &#145;compiled at the insistence of the Dublin Society&#146;  (title-page). In it he also gives an account of the diurnal variation of the compass needle and its correction following the work of a &#145;Mr Anderson&#146; and a description of his new combined theodolite and compass, known as Hood's compass theodolite, which was sold by Edward Spicer and James Lynch, both instrument makers of Dublin. This is the earliest known description of such an instrument. Hood is also said to have anticipated the invention of Hadley's quadrant, but he took out no patents. In the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Dublin Society</span> (1777) he advocated the use of a chain of 1/100th of an Irish mile. He died in 1784.<br>
<br>John Hood had at least one son, <a name="cosubject_77009"></a><span class="headword">John Hood</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1768&#150;1803), <span class="occ">land surveyor</span>, to whom Bendall attributes the publication and instrument which others have ascribed to the father. Two other land surveyors, the brothers <a name="cosubject_77011"></a><span class="headword">Henry Hood</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1777&#150;1811)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_77010"></a><span class="headword">Matthew Hood</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1800&#150;1804)<span class="occ"></span> were contemporaries of John the younger and may also have been his brothers, and therefore John the elder's sons. All produced estate maps, of which several are extant in collections in Ireland and Britain. Henry was in the 1790s employed by the first marquess of Abercorn, whose agent considered that he spent too much time studying and was too diffident and abstemious. Henry and John the younger developed a complex system of land classification for recording the type and quality of land they surveyed. The family was noted for the high quality of its work but did not achieve prosperity thereby: Matthew noted that even so successful a surveyor as his brother Henry had only one instrument. Matthew was a farm manager at Baronscourt on the Abercorn estate from October 1796 to May 1806 and his 200 letters to Lord Abercorn, account book, and map of Baronscourt (all at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland) give a detailed picture of his management of the land.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13679"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Hood</span>  (<em>c.</em>1800&#150;1875), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, the son of Matthew Hood and Margery Risk, was born in Moyle, co. Donegal, about 1800, emigrated to the USA in 1826, and was called to the bar in Philadelphia. He published a treatise, <span class="italic">On the Law of Decedents</span> (1847), and wrote, among other works, <span class="italic">A Brief Account of the Society of the Friendly Son of St Patrick</span> (1844) for the Hibernian Society of Philadelphia. He died at Philadelphia in 1875, survived by three sons and his wife, Ellen Gowen.<br>
