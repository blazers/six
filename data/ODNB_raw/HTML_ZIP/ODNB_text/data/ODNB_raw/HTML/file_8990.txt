<span class="headword">Evans,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>William Evans of Eton]</span>  (1798&#150;1877), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born probably at Eton College on 4 December 1798, the elder son of <a name="cosubject_8979"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Evans</span>  (1762&#150;1835), a <span class="occ">topographical draughtsman</span> from Flintshire, who taught drawing to the youngest daughters of George III before 1795. Samuel succeeded Richard Cooper as drawing-master at Eton College in 1808, and retired in 1822 to Droxford, Hampshire, near the birthplace of his wife, Ann Knight (1775&#150;1852). His views of Wales were engraved, and he produced coloured chalk and watercolour pictures for his pupils to copy.<br>
<br>After attending Eton College, William Evans abandoned a medical training to assist his father in 1819, and was appointed drawing-master of Eton by the headmaster, John Keate, whose children he was teaching, in 1823. William Collins and Peter DeWint gave him lessons, and he was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours on 11 February 1828, becoming a full member on 7 June 1830. His early work <span class="italic">The Brunswick and Winchester Towers from the Locks, Windsor</span> (1829) was acquired by Margaret Carpenter. The influence of his bohemian friends George Cattermole, Edwin Landseer, and above all John Frederick Lewis becomes increasingly evident on his technique during the 1830s. In 1836 he toured Connemara, returning to this remote area with his former pupil Thomas Gambier Parry in 1838.<br>
<br>Evans married Jane Grace Jackson (<i>b</i>. 1801) from Droxford in 1822; she died in 1837, leaving him with eight children. Encouraged by his colleagues George Selwyn and Edward Coleridge, he acquired Mrs Vallency's boys' house in 1839, and became an Eton &#145;dame&#146;. Enlightened discipline prevailed at Evans's and it attracted a talented mixture of pupils. In the mid-1830s he depicted cricket and the wall game on the playing fields, and the pageantry of the fourth of June regatta. His two Eton <span class="italic">Montem</span> pictures were exhibited in 1844, lithographed in 1852, and acquired by Lord Braybrooke in 1863; these remain his best-known works. In 1844 he recorded the visit of Tsar Nicholas I for Queen Victoria, and in 1846 began a lifelong friendship with the sixth duke and duchess of Atholl, which involved tutoring their son, Lord Tullibardine. Blair Atholl inspired several highland pictures, including <span class="italic">Sheep Shearing</span> (1848). To compete with the brilliance of oil paint, his large exhibition watercolours consist of increasing layers of pigment and highlight.<br>
<br>A broken jaw in 1844 left Evans with chronic pain which affected his painting arm, and opium was prescribed. His daughters began to help in the running of his house, Jane (1826&#150;1906) becoming a school legend. Evans reacted with hostility to Henry Cole's plans to reform the teaching of art in schools and resigned as drawing-master in 1853 to concentrate on his exhibition work, sending three pictures to the 1855 Paris Universal Exhibition. After 1845 he generally added &#145;of Eton&#146; to his signature in distinction from William Evans of Bristol (1809&#150;1858), who shared his Welsh repertoire. He canvassed for the election of John Frederick Lewis as president of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, acted as his right-hand man, and never forgave him for his sudden resignation in 1858. He proposed the introduction of winter exhibitions at the society, after it failed to leave the Pall Mall premises in 1859. Cannes reinvigorated him in 1868&#150;9, and he sent his last subject from Burnham Beeches to the 1874 exhibition. He died on 31 December 1877 at Evans's and was buried in Keate Lane cemetery, Eton.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_71665"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Thomas George Evans</span>  (1829&#150;1904), son of William Evans, was born in Wales on 26 May 1829. He attended Eton (1842&#150;8) and a Paris art school before assisting his father at Eton from 1849 to 1853; he succeeded him as <span class="occ">drawing-master</span> in 1854. When in 1888 art became part of the school curriculum, he ran the first drawing schools. In 1899 he published a manual on elementary drawing. He had sketched alongside his father, and even completed exhibition work for him. Similar compositions were chosen by both artists, especially popular Eton and Windsor views. Having trained at the Royal Academy Schools in 1849 he showed his first works there. On 8 February 1858 he was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, but although a regular exhibitor, he had to wait until 1894 for full membership. Anne, duchess of Atholl, befriended him bringing him royal patronage: he taught Princess Beatrice and Prince Leopold in 1867&#150;8, and Queen Victoria commissioned <span class="italic">In the Woods Near Balmoral</span> from him in 1874. On 1 August 1863 he married Susan Bros and they had four children. After his honeymoon Evans built a chalet and boathouse by Lake Hallstadt, and the Austrian Tyrol inspired many of his watercolours. In his last decade he painted seascapes from the south coast. He died on 1 November 1904 at the Old Watercolour Society's galleries in Pall Mall, London, and was buried at Eton. His son, William Sidney Vernon Evans (1869&#150;1943), assisted him after 1893, and became the last Evans to be drawing-master at Eton (1904&#150;22).<br>
