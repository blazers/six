<span class="headword">Austin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Taylor]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1793&#150;1867), <span class="occ">translator and writer</span>, was born in Colegate, Norwich, on 1 April 1793, the youngest of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "John Taylor (1750&#150;1826)")</script>, a wool and yarn manufacturer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27082/', "Susanna Taylor, n&#233;e Cook (1755&#150;1823)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "Taylor, John")</script>]. Among her siblings were: Susan, the mother of Henry Reeve (1813&#150;1895), editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27025/', "Edward Taylor (1784&#150;1863)")</script>, a vocalist and Gresham professor of music in London; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27059/', "John Taylor (1779&#150;1863)")</script>, a mining engineer; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27074/', "Richard Taylor (1781&#150;1858)")</script>, a printer and publisher, especially of scientific works, and editor of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>The Taylors were a prominent and prosperous part of the Unitarian community in Norwich. Sarah's great-grandfather Dr John Taylor (1694&#150;1761), an eminent scholar and author of <span class="italic">The Hebrew Concordance, Adapted to the English Bible</span> (1754&#150;7), was the first minister of the architecturally distinguished Octagon Chapel in Norwich. Her father, a composer of hymns and political songs, was active in Norwich politics, promoting civil liberties for dissenters and sympathizing with the French Revolution. Sarah Taylor was intensely proud of her family's achievements, including its part in the struggle against legal barriers to civil equality for dissenters. Family life was demanding but convivial and affectionate. Most of her thorough education was provided at home, where she was encouraged to read widely and to become familiar with Latin, French, Italian, and German.<br>
<br>The comfort, security, and warmth of this household was given up when Sarah Taylor married the brilliant but deeply flawed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/911/', "John Austin (1790&#150;1859)")</script> on 24 August 1819. What appeared during their engagement as melancholy and diffidence were in fact symptoms of pathological depression which became an obstacle to his fulfilling her expectations. He was reclusive, moody, hypercritical of himself and of her, and sometimes suicidal. His career, whatever he tried, foundered, as success eluded him, first at the bar, then as a professor of law, and finally as author. Although ambitious to establish a novel philosophy of law, he found writing difficult, which led Sarah to complain about his &#145;inert pen&#146;. They were strangely mismatched, and marital harmony was not enhanced by the contrasts between them, for she was self-confident and gregarious, and wrote with great facility.<br>
<br>John Austin's difficulties became evident gradually. During the early years of their marriage, though they lived impecuniously, Sarah was hopeful that he would make a name for himself, as they were drawn into the circle of radical, utilitarian intellectuals surrounding Jeremy Bentham and James Mill. Sarah Austin's warm-heartedness made her a favourite of the elderly Bentham, and to the youthful John Stuart Mill she was a substitute mother, whom he addressed affectionately as <i>M&uuml;tterlein</i>. Her expectations were sustained in 1827, when John Austin was made professor of jurisprudence and the law of nations at the new University of London, and they went to Bonn for more than a year while he prepared his lectures. Fragile hope soon turned to despair, however, for he was ill during much of the four years of teaching and resigned the professorship in 1833. Whereas she had nourished the idea of serving as helpmate to him in a career of scholarship and public service, most of her energies were devoted to making up for his deficiencies. Meanwhile, he became increasingly dependent on her as she tried to lift him out of his gloom, nursed him during his various bouts of illness, and managed every aspect of their life, becoming, she explained, &#145;the man of business in <i>our firm</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Troubled Lives</span>, 66).<br>
<br>Sarah Austin also supplemented their small income by writing for the monthlies and quarterlies and by translating. From the mid-1820s until 1836 she did this incessantly, and the drudgery added further strain to the marriage. Her translations from the French included fragments by Stendhal, Proven&ccedil;al poetry, Voltaire's <span class="italic">History of Charles XII</span> (1827), most of Victor Cousin's <span class="italic">Report on the State of Public Instruction in Prussia</span> (1834), and <span class="italic">The History of the Italian Republics</span> (1832) and <span class="italic">A History of the Fall of the Roman Empire</span> (1834) by Sismondi. She also translated German works, her proficiency having increased greatly during her residence at Bonn. At the suggestion of John Sterling, Carlyle's friend, she undertook translations which were later included in her <span class="italic">Fragments from German Prose Writers</span> (1841), an anthology that included passages from Grimm, Goethe, Kant, Schiller, Richter, Schlegel, Novalis, and Lessing. Her most important translation during these years was <span class="italic">Characteristics of Goethe</span> (1834), which was based on recollections by Falk and others and included some of Goethe's poetry. It prompted Carlyle to exclaim, &#145;you can <i>actually translate</i> <i>Goethe</i>&#146;, something, he added, only a few in England could do  (<span class="italic">Troubled Lives</span>, 70). She was already known, according to the publisher Dionysius Lardner, as &#145;our best living translator&#146;  (ibid., 71), and the three volumes on Goethe gave her some celebrity and much more work. She soon did two of the volumes of Frederick von Raumer's <span class="italic">England in 1835</span> (1836) and Heinrich Hase's <span class="italic">The Public and Private Life of the Ancient Greeks</span> (1836). She could well claim to be &#145;the busiest woman in the world&#146;  (ibid., 70), and she was justified in believing she had &#145;fought poverty single handed&#146; and that, as she told Brougham, &#145;my own fingers and my own head such as it is have sufficed to secure us against the want we must otherwise have felt&#146;  (ibid., 72).<br>
<br>During the early 1830s, with middle age approaching, her husband's symptoms at their worst, and his career stalled, Sarah Austin began translating <span class="italic">Letters from a Dead Man</span> by Hermann von P&uuml;ckler-Muskau, a German nobleman who became known for his landscaping and as a travel writer: it was the beginning of an episode that for a few years transformed her life. In this book&#151;an account of travels and adventures in which the author revealed his many-sided character&#151;she encountered a man the very opposite of John Austin, for P&uuml;ckler was light-hearted, bold, unscrupulous, hedonistic, and boastfully erotic. Their correspondence initially concerned her translation, which was published as <span class="italic">Tour in England, Ireland, and France</span> (1832), but it soon became personal, as he elicited complaints about her marriage. &#145;I turn my heart inside out to you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Contemplating Adultery</span>, 79), she told him, as she expressed the love and desire that had been unsatisfied during the previous thirteen years of marriage. She wrote more than eighty imprudent letters which conveyed her obsessive love for him but also her fear of being discovered and blackmailed. Plans for a meeting were made when she contemplated a summer journey to Bonn in 1832 and again to Berlin a year later, when her husband resigned his professorship and she expected to be free to travel with him. These plans came to nothing, partly because P&uuml;ckler showed himself less audacious than he first appeared, and Sarah Austin was left desolate, having experienced nothing but fantasies which were symptoms of her disappointment. Eight years later she and P&uuml;ckler met in Berlin, but by this time her love for him was only a memory.<br>
<br>In 1836, as her correspondence with P&uuml;ckler came to an end, Sarah Austin was in Malta, for John Austin had been appointed head of a commission to recommend changes in the constitutional arrangements for Malta, including its legal system. In contrast to her earlier penury, she suddenly enjoyed the comforts and privileges that accompanied her husband's new position, but in other respects little changed. The reforms recommended by him aroused opposition and engendered controversy, both in Malta and in London, and the turmoil led to a renewal of his illness, which worsened when he was criticized in parliament. Once again, while he foundered, Sarah Austin thrived. She befriended the Maltese, opened new schools, and during a cholera epidemic she heroically ignored risks as she nursed the sick, leading one Maltese to call her &#145;a mother to us all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Troubled Lives</span>, 118).<br>
<br>After the termination of the Malta appointment in 1838, John Austin never sought employment again, making it possible to live in exile on the continent, away from the expenses and humiliation in London. Before departing, since they still needed money, Sarah Austin resumed translating and quickly completed Leopold von Ranke's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical and political history of the popes of Rome during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries</span> (1840). The couple moved to Dresden in 1841, where they lived comfortably until 1843. While there she wrote for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, including several articles on German history, some later included in her <span class="italic">Germany from 1760 to 1814, or, Sketches of German Life</span> (1854), and these contributed to her reputation as an important interpreter of German life and culture for English audiences. In 1843 they moved to Paris, where she continued to translate, this time Ranke's <span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, which appeared in three large volumes in 1845&#150;7. Here she also became hostess of a cosmopolitan salon that attracted literary and political figures, including Mignet, Tocqueville, Saint-Hilaire, Thierry, Bastiat, Faucher, Circourt, Lamartine, Laube, and Normanby. She also was befriended by Guizot, who was head of Louis Philippe's government, and later translated his <span class="italic">Democracy in France</span> (1849) and his <span class="italic">On the Causes of the Success of the English Revolution of 1640&#150;1688</span> (1850). The Austins left Paris early in 1848, soon after the revolution began.<br>
<br>On their return to England, the Austins settled at Weybridge, and during the remaining years of her husband's life Sarah Austin encouraged him to complete the work on jurisprudence he had long planned. After he died in 1859 without having done this, Sarah made up for his failure by republishing his <span class="italic">Province of Jurisprudence Determined</span> (1832), a book first published through her initiative. She then combined this work, which consisted of the introductory part of his University of London lectures, with the previously unpublished lectures from the same course, producing <span class="italic">Lectures on Jurisprudence, or, The Philosophy of Positive Law</span> (1863). She did some editing, added other material, and wrote a long preface, more apologetic than biographical. She thought her work made certain that his &#145;great thoughts might not perish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Troubled Lives</span>, 196). Her enterprise was rewarded, for there were two editions in her lifetime and three more by 1885. The work was reviewed favourably by John Stuart Mill and was used as an examination book at Cambridge and Oxford. Before this Austin was known only in a small circle, but Mrs Austin established his reputation as a legal philosopher and founder of the Austinian theory of law.<br>
<br>Sarah Austin's last years were saddened by the illness of her only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8175/', "Lucie Duff Gordon (1821&#150;1869)")</script>, who suffered from tuberculosis and lived abroad to escape the harsh British winters, in 1860 at the Cape of Good Hope and a year later in Egypt. Mrs Austin, always able to recognize ideas for books, published her daughter's <span class="italic">Letters from Egypt</span> (1865); three editions appeared that year and many more subsequently. During these years her own health deteriorated. She suffered chest pains, the aftermath of a heart attack in Paris in 1844, and she became heavy and was hampered by gout.<br>
<br>Sarah Austin's translations overshadowed her own writing in the quarterlies on Goethe, Shakespeare, Germany, and French politics, but she chose this course, not only because translations earned more, but to limit the authorship that would have been an affront to her husband, whose own publication record was meagre. Here too she subordinated herself to him, and friends, such as Mill, Carlyle, and Francis Jeffrey, who appreciated her literary talent, recognized her sacrifice, as she did when she referred to &#145;voluntary abnegations of what [she] might perhaps have attained&#146;  (<span class="italic">Troubled Lives</span>, 147). Indications of what that might have been can be found in her lively, poignant, graceful letters, which reveal her complex character, including her unending struggles with vanity, ambition, and desire, as well as her sense of duty, compassion, and self-sacrifice.<br>
<br>Sarah Austin had strong opinions on many matters. Although her family's Unitarianism and her early association with the Benthamites made her somewhat radical, she became apprehensive about the disintegrating effects of rapid social change on traditional institutions and established authority, and like her husband she became increasingly conservative. She feared revolution, which she witnessed in 1848, and criticized the growing demands for democratic reform: in an analysis that had affinities with Tocqueville's, she forecast that equality would lead to selfishness, anti-authoritarianism, and finally despotism of the kind practised by Louis Napoleon. She advocated compulsory primary education on the Prussian model as a way of instilling a sense of responsibility to the social order. While asserting the intellectual equality of women and condemning their subordination such as she had observed in Germany, she refused to support the feminist movement in Britain and upheld traditional, family-centred roles for women.<br>
<br>Sarah Austin had great physical beauty, which was enhanced by an outgoing, warm-hearted, engaging personality. As a young woman she was described as &#145;dazzling, attractive, imposing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Troubled Lives</span>, 3), and portraits by Linnell done when she was more than forty still conveyed these features. She was self-confident, energetic, and quick to take initiatives and organize others, which made her somewhat dominating but also quite courageous and resourceful, as shown by her organizing a rescue from a shipwreck at Boulogne and her mobilizing a bucket brigade to put out a hotel fire.<br>
<br>Mrs Austin also was able to establish rapport with others, which translated into a remarkable gift for friendship. Her sympathy, vitality, and insight were appreciated by Bentham, Anna Barbauld, Harriet Grote, Guizot, Anna Jameson, Sydney Smith (whose letters she edited for publication in 1855), the third marquess of Lansdowne, George Cornewall Lewis, Hermann Heine, Jane Welsh Carlyle, Auguste Comte, John Sterling, Santa Rosa, Saint-Hilaire, Victor Cousin, and Francis Jeffrey, who commissioned one of the Linnell portraits.<br>
<br>Sarah Austin died at home at Nutfield Cottage, Weybridge, on 8 August 1867, aged seventy-four, from heart and kidney disease. She was buried next to her husband in the Weybridge churchyard.<br>
