<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cook,  Eliza</span>  (1812&#150;1889), <span class="occ">poet and journalist</span>, was born on 24 December 1812 in London Road, Southwark, the youngest of eleven children of Joseph Cook, a tinman and brazier. Her poem &#145;The Streets&#146; recalls her London childhood. Her father retired from business when she was about nine years old, and the family moved to a farm in St Leonard's Forest, near Horsham, Sussex. Cook was probably largely self-educated, but with her mother's encouragement she began to write poetry before the age of fifteen. In a preface to her collected <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1845), she described this as a period in which &#145;rhyme was probably faster than reason&#146;. Her mother died when she was fifteen, and poems such as &#145;The Old Arm-Chair&#146; and &#145;I miss thee, my mother&#146; testify to her loss.<br>
<br>Cook's first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Lays of a Wild Harp</span>, was published in 1835. Shortly thereafter she began submitting poems under her initials to the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>, <span class="italic">Metropolitan Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>. Her work was praised by William Jerdan in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, and the popular response to her poems prompted her to reveal her name to the public. She was then living in St George's Road, Walworth. Her second volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Melaia and other Poems</span>, was published in 1838 and reissued in 1840 and 1845; it met with popular success in both England and America. Her last volume, <span class="italic">New Echoes and other Poems</span>, was published in 1864.<br>
<br>The appeal of Cook's poems lay in their simple forms and subjects and in the sentiment which infused them, which has aptly been described as &#145;consistently humane&#146;  (Taylor, 190). Her work was compared to that of Robert Burns, whom she admired. Cook wrote with great sympathy of marginal figures, including labourers, poor children, homesick seafarers, and American Indians. In A. H. Miles's <span class="italic">Poets and Poetry of the Nineteenth Century</span>, J. H. Ingram wrote that Cook &#145;sang for the people, and was comprehended of the people&#146;. Cook's treatment of the disfranchised was informed by strong democratic beliefs, forcefully expressed in her poem &#145;Nature's Gentleman&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Nature with a matchless hand, sends forth <i>her</i> nobly born,<br>
</div>
<div>And laughs the paltry attributes of wealth and rank to scorn.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Some of her poems, such as &#145;A Song, to &#147;The People&#148; of England&#146;, were overtly revolutionary. As a testament to their widespread popularity, a number of her poems (including &#145;The Old Arm-Chair&#146;, &#145;The Old Water Mill&#146;, &#145;The Indian Hunter&#146;, and &#145;O come to the ingle side&#146;) were set to music by various composers in the 1840s and 1850s. In addition, her poem on Thomas Hood (&#145;Poor Hood&#146;) led to the erection of a memorial to him in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>In 1849 Cook began publishing a weekly miscellany, <span class="italic">Eliza Cook's Journal</span>. In her first issue Cook punned on her surname, describing her editorial role as that of preparing &#145;a plain feast, where the viands will be all of my own choosing, and some of my own dressing&#146;. The goal of her <span class="italic">Journal</span> was to assist in the &#145;stirring development of progressive mind in &#147;the mass&#148;&#146; by providing materials that would provide a &#145;steady and free communion with Truth&#146;. While her <span class="italic">Journal</span> was certainly directed towards women readers and contained many of the staples of women's magazines&#151;including poetry, tips on housekeeping and childcare, and juvenile fiction&#151;it was also directed to members of the working classes. The <span class="italic">Journal</span> thus supported and extended the democratic ideals expressed in Cook's poetry. During its five-year run the <span class="italic">Journal</span> regularly featured strongly worded essays (many of them written by Cook) advocating increased educational and employment opportunities for women and for working-class people. Its pages supported public libraries, mechanics' institutions, extended Sunday hours for museums and exhibitions, and expanded career opportunities for women (such as interior and fashion design, engraving, typesetting, and watchmaking). <span class="italic">Eliza Cook's Journal</span> also supported emigration and looked to America for models of social reform. In addition to her own work, Cook published essays, poetry, and fiction by Samuel Smiles, Eliza Meteyard (Silverpen), Frances Deane, and Charles Hardwick. Cook's journalistic endeavours met with success: the <span class="italic">Journal</span> achieved a first-year circulation of between 50,000 and 60,000 copies  (Altick, 394). Forced by ill health to cease publication in 1854, Cook used her final &#145;Word to my readers&#146; to thank readers for supporting her &#145;efforts in the cause of simple Poetry and popular Progression&#146;, and to reiterate that she had undertaken the <span class="italic">Journal</span> &#145;less with the desire of gaining my daily bread than with the wish to be of use to my fellow creatures&#146;. Many of her essays were reissued in 1860 as <span class="italic">Jottings from my Journal</span>, and in 1865 sayings and aphorisms from the <span class="italic">Journal</span> were collected, supplemented by new material, and published as <span class="italic">Diamond Dust</span>.<br>
<br>The sentiments expressed in Cook's poetry and prose reflect her efforts to break free from the societal limitations imposed on her class and gender. A woman who prided herself on her tiny hands and feet, Cook dressed in unconventionally masculine attire and wore her hair short. J. Leach notes that Cook's dress &#145;proclaimed a determination to be herself&#146; and relates how an 1851 story in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> describes her as &#145;Tilting back in her chair, planting both feet on the fender&#146;, and &#145;bluffly order[ing] a glass of beer&#146;  (Leach, 157). Cook was also most probably a lesbian. She never married, and from 1845 to 1849 she was closely linked with the American actress Charlotte Cushman (1816&#150;1876), to whom she wrote passionate poetic tributes (&#145;To Charlotte Cushman&#146;).<br>
<br>Although collected editions of her works appeared in the 1870s and 1880s, Cook's public life ended in the 1860s. In 1863 she was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100 per annum. She appears to have lived in relative seclusion and semi-invalidism until her death at her home, Beech House, 23 Thornton Hill, Wimbledon, on 23 September 1889.<br>
