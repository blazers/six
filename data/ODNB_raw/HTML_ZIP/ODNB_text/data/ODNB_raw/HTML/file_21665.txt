<span class="headword">Peach,  Charles William</span>  (1800&#150;1886), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 30 September 1800 at Wansford, Northamptonshire, the son of Charles William Peach, saddler, farmer, and innkeeper, and Elizabeth Vellum. He was educated to the age of fifteen, his last three years of schooling being at Folkingham, Lincolnshire. In his youth, he participated enthusiastically in field sports. He first worked for his father, but in 1824 entered the mounted coastguard, initially at several places in Norfolk, then in Dorset and Devon, and subsequently at Gorran Haven, Cornwall, in 1834. On occasion, he had to engage in hand-to-hand encounters with smugglers. With anonymous support from the geologist William Buckland he transferred to the customs at Fowey in 1845. In 1849 he was posted to Peterhead, Scotland. From 1853 he was comptroller at Wick. He married Jemima Mabson on 26 April 1829. They had seven sons and two daughters. One son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37839/', "Benjamin Neeve Peach")</script>, became a renowned member of the Scottish branch of the geological survey.<br>
<br>Without formal scientific training, but with ample opportunity for studying coastal marine life and coastal rocks, Peach rapidly established a reputation as an observer and a collector. He corresponded with leading British naturalists, attended meetings of the British Association, and became a member or associate of numerous natural history societies, notably the Polytechnic Society of Cornwall and the Physical Society of Edinburgh. Eighty-six publications by Peach are listed in the <span class="italic">Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers</span>. Peach was visited in Cornwall by such notables as Alfred Tennyson. In north Scotland he became a friend and fellow worker of the naturalist Robert Dick, the &#145;baker of Thurso&#146;.<br>
<br>In marine zoology, Peach discovered new mollusca, encrinites, sea urchins, starfish, polyzoa, fish, sponges, and so on, and a spectacular holothurian with twenty tentacles. In 1838 he discovered obscure fossil fish remains near Polruan, and in the years following he rapidly extended his knowledge of fossil forms in areas of Cornwall previously regarded as unfossiliferous &#145;primitive&#146; terrain. In 1843 he identified remains from near Polperro as Pteraspidian fish-shields. Frederick McCoy thought these were sponges but Peach was subsequently vindicated by E. Ray Lankester.<br>
<br>Peach's fossil localities were reported for the benefit of other investigators, and he was always keen to share his knowledge with metropolitan scientists. His Cornish and Devon fossils were referred either to the Silurian (now Ordovician) or to the Devonian systems. He donated his large collection of Cornish fossils to the Geological Society of Cornwall and arranged the materials for them. In Caithness he investigated fossil fish of the Old Red Sandstone together with Dick. In 1853 he made an important fossil discovery in limestone on the coast near Durness, with forms that were construed as Silurian by Sir Roderick Murchison, who used the formation as a stratigraphic marker to claim the rocks of much of northern Scotland as Silurian, though today the schists there are placed in the Precambrian and the limestone is regarded as Cambro-Ordovician. Murchison and Peach undertook joint fieldwork in north-west Scotland in 1858. On retirement to Edinburgh in 1861, Peach did work on glacial geology and palaeobotany. He died at his home, 30 Haddington Place, Edinburgh, on 28 February 1886.<br>
<br>Peach's work met with much approbation. He was awarded several grants, notably the Wollaston Fund of the Geological Society of London, together with medals from the Cornwall Polytechnic Society and the Neill medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His work was described and praised by Samuel Smiles in his biography of Dick, and both men could be said to exemplify Smilesian ideals of self-help.<br>
