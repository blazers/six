<span class="headword">Burrow,  Thomas</span>  (1909&#150;1986), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born on 29 June 1909 in Leck, north Lancashire, the eldest in the family of five sons and one daughter of Joshua Burrow, farmer, and his wife, Frances Eleanor Carter. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth's School, Kirkby Lonsdale, and won a scholarship to Christ's College, Cambridge. He first read classics, specializing in comparative philology, and obtained first classes in parts one and two of the tripos (1929 and 1930). He then went on to study oriental languages, in which he also got firsts in both parts of the tripos (1931 and 1932). He began research for a year at the School of Oriental Studies, London University, and continued in Cambridge, where after two more years he was awarded a PhD. He became a research fellow of Christ's College (1935&#150;7).<br>
<br>Burrow's first book, <span class="italic">The Language of the Kharosth&#299;, Documents from Chinese Turkestan</span> (1937), was based on his doctoral thesis. The language in question, sometimes known as Niya Prakrit, was an official language in central Asia after the Kushan dynasty; the documents had been discovered and brought to Europe by Sir Aurel Stein. Burrow published his translation of them in 1940.<br>
<br>Burrow was assistant keeper in the department of oriental printed books and manuscripts at the British Museum from 1937 to 1944. During this period he mainly devoted himself to studying Dravidian languages. In 1944 he was appointed Boden professor of Sanskrit at Oxford University and professorial fellow of Balliol College, positions which he held until his retirement in 1976. Until 1965 he was the university's sole teacher in classical Indology. Besides Sanskrit he had to teach Pali and Prakrit. His practice was to read a set Sanskrit text with a BA student (or students, on the rare occasions when there was more than one in a year) for three hours a week; those texts not covered in class the students read unaided in the vacations. He gave some extra classes in Pali or Prakrit and in Sanskrit composition, but he may never have set an essay.<br>
<br>Of Burrow's many publications on Sanskrit, the best known are <span class="italic">The Sanskrit Language</span> (1955, revised edn 1973) and <span class="italic">The Problem of Shwa in Sanskrit</span> (1979). His views on the development of the Sanskrit vowel system were at odds with those of most Indo-Europeanists, but otherwise his exposition of Sanskrit was orthodox in the mainstream of comparative philology. His early interest in Prakrit did not develop further.<br>
<br>Burrow was happiest as a Dravidologist and did his most important work in Dravidian linguistics. In 1949 he began to collaborate with Professor Murray B. Emeneau of Berkeley. Together they published <span class="italic">A Dravidian Etymological Dictionary</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">Dravidian Borrowings from Indo-Aryan</span> (1962). After retirement Burrow gave most of his energy to producing the second edition of the dictionary (1984); it was, as he intended, his last book. This work on comparative Dravidian linguistics was complemented by Burrow's research on hitherto unrecorded Dravidian languages which survive in small linguistic communities in central India. To record them, he undertook field trips with S. Bhattacharya of the anthropological survey of India; together they published <span class="italic">The Parji Language</span> (1953), <span class="italic">A Comparative Vocabulary of the Gondi Dialects</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">The Pengo Language</span> (1970). Further fruits of Burrow's research in this field are gathered in his <span class="italic">Collected Papers in Dravidian Linguistics</span> (1968).<br>
<br>Burrow was widely respected as a single-minded scholar of great learning. A Sanskrit panegyric was presented to him by the Sanskrit College, Calcutta. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1970. In 1974 he became a fellow of the School of Oriental and African Studies of London University and in 1979 a number of the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies</span> (vol. 42, no. 2) was devoted to articles in honour of his seventieth birthday.<br>
<br>In build Burrow was rather over middle size and his appearance, at least in later life, was somewhat lumbering, but he moved quietly. His habitual expression was mild, even vague. He had very short sight and blinked frequently. To his colleagues and students he was amiable but socially passive and taciturn. There were reports that of an evening he would visit his local pub in Kidlington, near Oxford, and entertain companions with lively conversation; but in Oxford he was reticent about his private life to the point of secrecy. In 1941 he married Inez Mary, daughter of Herbert John Haley; but when she died at their home in 1976 it came as a surprise to his Oxford acquaintances, who believed him to be living alone. He never brought his wife into college, and explained after her death that her health was poor. It may be that she suffered from depression after their only child died in early infancy. Burrow died of a heart attack in Oxford on 8 June 1986 and was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Kidlington.<br>
