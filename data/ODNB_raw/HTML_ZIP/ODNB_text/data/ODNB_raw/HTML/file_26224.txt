<span class="headword">Staley <span class="st"> [Stayley]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">victim of the Popish Plot</span>, was the son of William Staley, a goldsmith and banker. He was raised abroad as a Roman Catholic, where it was polemically assumed that with &#145;too much familiarity with the Jesuits, [he] had imbid'd some of there desperate Principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tryal and Condemnation</span>, 3). He later took over his father's business in Covent Garden, where his clients were predominantly Roman Catholic. The panic caused by the revelations of Titus Oates and William Bedloe in 1678 of a popish plot had a severe effect on his trade, and Staley was said to be enraged that his creditors called in their money so fast as a result. On 14 November 1678 he was discussing this situation in the Black Lion tavern, King Street, with an old friend, Barthlemy Fromante, a native of Marseilles. Although speaking in French they were overheard by William Carstares and Alexander Sutherland, the latter of whom wrote down in French what was said. The following day Carstares approached Staley and accused him of high treason. Gilbert Burnet, believing that Carstares was &#145;a loose and vicious gentlemen&#146;, wrote to both the attorney-general, Sir William Jones, and the lord chancellor, Heneage Finch, &#145;to let them know what profligate wretches these witnesses were&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.171, 113). Such was the political climate that this intervention meant that Burnet was &#145;most bitterly railed at&#146; and that for a time he lived in &#145;fear of public affronts&#146;  (ibid., 2.172). Carstares, apparently motivated by the belief that &#145;it might be profitable to turn informer&#146;, offered to drop the charge if Staley paid him &pound;200. Staley refused, was arrested for treason, and was brought to trial before the king's bench on Thursday, 21 November 1678.<br>
<br>Staley's religion, the decline of his business, and the general belief in a papist design to kill the king and convert England to Catholicism were all used as part of the evidence against him. Carstares testified that he had heard Staley call the king &#145;a great Heretic and the greatest Rogue in the World&#146; and that with hand on heart he had declared &#145;I would with this hand kill him myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tryal of William Staley</span>, 4). He also claimed that Staley called parliament &#145;rogues&#146; for believing that the plot was over, in all of which he was backed up by Sutherland. Both men testified that when they heard these words they were only 7 or 8 feet from Staley in the room opposite and that the door to the room he was occupying was open.<br>
<br>Staley did not deny his presence in the tavern on that day but claimed that the witnesses had misunderstood the conversation. He testified that the discussion was regarding the king of France and that he had said &#145;here's the Hand and here's the Heart which would kill myself&#146;, not that he had threatened to kill the king  (<span class="italic">Tryal of William Staley</span>, 8). This play on words was dismissed by the lord chief justice as a &#145;Jesuit's trick&#146;. Staley also argued that as &#145;a person of some intelligence&#146; he would not be foolish enough to speak such words in a public place, where many who understood French would be able to overhear him  (<span class="italic">Tryal of William Staley</span>, 8). Summing up, Lord Chief Justice Scroggs made his belief in Staley's guilt quite clear when directing the jury, making references to the plot and the character of Jesuits. The jury found him guilty without withdrawing and he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.<br>
<br>Dr William Lloyd visited Staley in Newgate and offered him his life if he would discover any further plots. Staley maintained his innocence, claiming that he neither knew of any plots nor had spoken the words he was accused of. On Tuesday 26 November 1678 he was dragged on a sledge to Tyburn where he was executed. Instead of his quarters being set upon the city gates the king allowed them to be delivered to his relatives. Mass was said over his remains and a &#145;grand&#146; funeral was arranged from his father's house on 29 November, before his burial in St Paul's, Covent Garden  (Willis-Bund, 473). This incensed the government so much that the coroner ordered the body to be dug up and delivered to the sheriff to be set upon the city gates. The day following Staley's death saw the beginning of the high profile trial of Edward Coleman, which largely overshadowed the fact that Staley was the first victim of the Popish Plot trials.<br>
