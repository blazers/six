<span class="headword">White <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Johnson]</span>,  Richard</span>  (1604&#150;1687), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in the diocese of Winchester of poor Roman Catholic parents; his father's name was Mark White. He entered the English College at Douai on 13 August 1621 and adopted the alias of Johnson, which he retained for the rest of his life. He graduated in philosophy in 1625 and taught grammar in the college in the following academic year, while commencing his study of theology. On 13 September 1629 he was the main speaker in a public disputation held in honour of Viscount Montagu's visit. He was ordained priest on 23 February 1630 and exactly one month later he was sent from Douai to assist Stephen Barnes as confessor of the English Augustinian canonesses of St Monica's at Louvain, where he arrived on 26 May. He acted in that capacity for twenty years, and for thirty-six years after Barnes's death he was principal confessor to the community. In 1633 he was absent in England on business for a short time, and in 1635, when the town was besieged by the French and Dutch armies, he led most of the community into refuge, first at Ghent and then at Bruges, returning after the siege was lifted. For the last decade of his life he was assisted by George Lynde. In his final few years he was disabled by palsy, and he died in the convent on 12 January 1687. He was buried there.<br>
<br>Johnson left in manuscript over 100 catechetical discourses, 300 sermons, and numerous treatises, most of which were lost at the time of the French Revolution. One of them, a treatise on the sequence of Pentecost (&#145;Veni sancte spiritus&#146;) which survives in several manuscript copies, was printed in 1878 and in a different edition in 1913.<br>
