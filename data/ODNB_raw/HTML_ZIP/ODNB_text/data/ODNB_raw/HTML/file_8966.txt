<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (1767&#150;1827), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister</span>, was born at Usk, Monmouthshire, on 2 October 1767. He traced his descent through an almost unbroken line of Baptist preachers from the time of the Commonwealth. After some schooling at Bristol, in November 1783 he became a student at the Bristol Baptist college, over which his relative, Dr Caleb Evans, presided as theological tutor. In 1787 he matriculated at King's College, Aberdeen, where he remained for three years. He then spent a year at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA. He returned to England in 1791.<br>
<br>Having some doubts about Calvinist doctrine, Evans accepted an invitation from the morning congregation of General Baptists in Worship Street, London, where, after officiating for a few months, he was chosen pastor and ordained on 31 May 1792. He remained at Worship Street for the rest of his life. Immediately on assuming this office, Evans published <span class="italic">An address humbly designed to promote the revival of religion, more especially among the General Baptists</span> (1793). Two years later he opened a seminary, located first at Hoxton Square and subsequently at 7 Pullin's Row, Islington, where he taught for about thirty years.<br>
<br>In August 1795 Evans married Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29347/', "John Wiche")</script>, General Baptist minister at Maidstone. They had four sons. In 1815 Evans was attacked by a degenerative disease which within two years deprived him of the use of his legs. In 1825 he withdrew from the Society of Antiquaries, to which he had been elected a fellow in 1803, and resigned his school, having in December 1821 lost his third son, the Revd Caleb Evans, who had been his intended successor. Although obliged to be carried from his couch to the pulpit, he continued to preach until a few weeks before his death at his home in Pullin's Row, Islington, on 25 January 1827. He was a liberal-minded man, knowledgeable on a wide range of subjects.<br>
<br>Evans's writings, some forty in number, comprise sermons, tracts, prefaces, biographical and topographical notices, and school books. He is best-known for his <span class="italic">Sketch of the Denominations of the Christian World</span>, which first appeared in early 1795 in the form of a shilling pamphlet. Its rapid sale called for a second edition in July of the same year, and during the next thirty years fourteen successive editions were circulated; a fifteenth edition had been completed by the author immediately before his last illness. The book was translated into Welsh and various other languages, and several editions were issued in America, initially at Boston (1807). A sequel to the <span class="italic">Sketch</span>, entitled <span class="italic">A Preservative Against the Infidelity and Uncharitableness of the Eighteenth Century</span> (1796), was later issued as <span class="italic">The Golden Centenary</span> (1806). Other significant works included <span class="italic">General Redemption the Only Proper Basis of General Benevolence: a Letter to Robert Hawker</span> (1809). <span class="italic">Complete Religious Liberty Vindicated</span> (1813) considered the petition for the abolition of all penal statutes by the dissenting ministers of London and Westminster.<br>
