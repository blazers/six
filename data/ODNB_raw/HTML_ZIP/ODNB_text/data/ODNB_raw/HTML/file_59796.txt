<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Buckton,  Raymond William <span class="st"> [Ray]</span></span>  (1922&#150;1995), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 20 October 1922 in Rillington, near Malton, Yorkshire, the eldest of seven children of William Ernest Buckton, farm labourer, and his wife, Hannah Young. Although his father was a farm worker, Buckton was born into a railway family, and after attending Appleton Roebuck elementary school he followed his uncles onto the footplate and became an engine cleaner at York depot at the age of sixteen. While still employed as a &#145;third man&#146; he helped to fire the <span class="italic">Flying Scotsman</span>. At nineteen he became the youngest branch secretary in the Amalgamated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF). He also became active in local politics, becoming chairman of the constituency Labour Party and the youngest alderman on the city council. On 20 March 1954 he married Barbara Gerry (<i>b</i>. 1928/9), a chef, daughter of Robert Langfield, a locomotive driver. They enjoyed what appeared to be a perfect marriage, and had two sons.<br>
<br>Buckton became a full-time employee of ASLEF as the society's Irish officer, based in Dublin, in 1962. Nevertheless, the following year he became assistant general secretary, and in 1970 general secretary, serving until his retirement in 1987. As general secretary during a prolonged period of industrial strife on the railways, he was one of Britain's most widely hated trade union leaders, whose notoriety derived from his perceived position as the militant head of a small but &#145;irresponsible&#146; craft union. He arrived at his union's splendid offices in Arkwright Road, Hampstead (the birthplace of Sir Thomas Beecham), just in time for three crucial battles with the British Railways board, one and a half of which he won.<br>
<br>The first reached its climax in 1974 and concerned the fourteen-year erosion of the so-called Guillebaud formula. This sought to link railway pay to rates for similar work in the private sector. After sporadic industrial action all three railway unions agreed to submit their claims to the railway's own arbitration machinery&#151;a commendable, if rare, example of inter-union solidarity. The result was a substantial rise in real pay for all railway grades, in exchange for promises of improved performance.<br>
<br>The second battle peaked in the early 1980s and centred on the board's determination to introduce single manning of footplates and a differential payment for driving high-speed trains. ASLEF fought this struggle alone, with its traditional mixture of obduracy and perseverance. Eventually Buckton was forced to accept the first objective, but persuaded the board to postpone the second, at least for the foreseeable future.<br>
<br>The third struggle was by far the most bitter and protracted. It concerned the terms demanded for what was called &#145;flexible rostering&#146;, that is, the freedom of management to rearrange shifts so that drivers spent more time at the controls. In 1983 Buckton demonstrated, before another hearing of the industry's own tribunal, that the board had little idea of the actual savings involved. They had also worked out few answers to his many practical objections. His difficulty was that once again he had no support among the other unions. In the end he was forced to sign an agreement of sorts, though it was by no means clear that management extracted many worthwhile concessions.<br>
<br>Buckton served on the general council of the TUC from 1973 to 1986, and was its president in 1984&#150;5. He was a conscientious committee man, representing the TUC on a number of public bodies. He tirelessly supported the policies of the left on council, and it was a much noted irony on the right that he found himself president during the disastrous year of the miners' strike. He did his best to mobilize support for the miners' cause, on the impossible terms demanded by their leaders. This time he failed completely, and regarded the result as the biggest disappointment of his life.<br>
<br>At the rostrum Buckton was voluble, sonorous, and sometimes over the top. In negotiation he was perspicacious, astute, and capable of sudden concessions. Off duty he was gregarious, genial, and relaxed. He sang to his own accordion and played the mouth organ well. He always claimed that he never bothered about the things irate commuters stuck through his letter box; he said he did not mind about the death threats and abusive phone calls. He laughed off the tin of paint thrown at his windscreen while he was waiting at a red light. What the public did not know, or care about, was that his was a union run by its full-time lay executive. Buckton had no vote and few levers of influence. His job was to convince the executive to go out and persuade the members to accept the inevitable, for the best price he could squeeze out of the board. It was a strategy that defied public explanation or excuse.<br>
<br>On his retirement Buckton and his wife opened a Mexican bistro in Bushey, Hertfordshire, but they sold it after a year to buy a villa in Albufeira, Portugal. There he kept busy organizing the expatriate vote for Labour, with the help of his friend Clive Dunn (Corporal Jones from the television comedy <span class="italic">Dad's Army</span>). Ray Buckton died of stomach cancer in Albufeira on 7 May 1995; he was survived by his wife and two sons.<br>
