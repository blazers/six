<span class="headword">Pereira,  George Edward</span>  (1865&#150;1923), <span class="occ">army officer and explorer</span>, was born on 26 January 1865, at 4 Upper Portland Place, Marylebone, London. He was the second of four children and eldest son of Edward Pereira (1817&#150;1872), gentleman, of 23 Grosvenor Square, and his wife, the Hon. Margaret Anne Stonor (1839&#150;1894), eighth daughter of Thomas Stonor, third Baron Camoys, and his wife, Frances.<br>
<br>Educated at the Oratory School, Edgbaston (1876&#150;83) under Cardinal Newman, and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1883&#150;4) where he was a contemporary of Leslie Napier Younghusband, brother of Sir Francis Younghusband, Pereira was commissioned in the 3rd battalion of the Grenadier Guards on 23 August 1884. A hunting accident in January 1885 left him with a permanent limp which threatened his two great ambitions&#151;to see active service and to explore unknown lands. Hoping to be selected for the expeditionary force to the Sudan, he went to Cairo to learn Arabic, but his lameness was against him and he remained on home service until 1899.<br>
<br>In April 1899 Captain Pereira was seconded for service with the Chinese regiment of infantry recently formed at Weihaiwei. In 1900 he took part in the fighting at Tientsin (Tianjin) where he was slightly wounded and in the relief of the legations at Peking (Beijing). He was awarded the DSO &#145;in recognition of services during the recent operations in China&#146;. After spending much of 1901 touring the provinces of north-east China, Major Pereira in May 1902 rejoined his battalion in South Africa for the campaigns in the Transvaal and Cape Colony. Late in 1903 he went to Korea, and in January 1904 he was appointed temporary military attach&eacute; to the British minister at Seoul in Korea. In 1905, as military attach&eacute; with the Japanese army, he witnessed the Manchurian campaign, and at its close became military attach&eacute; at Peking, a post he held until 1910. He was made a CMG in March 1906.<br>
<br>As military attach&eacute; Pereira made a series of long journeys in every part of China during 1906&#150;8, visiting various units of the Chinese army. His tact and understanding and his conversational ability enabled him to make many personal friends among high officials. The knowledge he gained of Chinese people from the soldiers of his Weihaiwei regiment to the highest levels of officialdom was of great value for his later travels. He came back to Europe in 1909, but peacetime soldiering held no attractions and he resigned his commission in July of that year.<br>
<br>In the following year Pereira returned to China and journeyed from Peking through Chihli (Zhili) and Shansi, across the Ordos to Ninghsia. In 1911 he spent nine months exploring and shooting in the Altai and T'ien Shan. In 1912 he visited the Kumbun and Labrang monasteries in south-western Kansu before moving south along the upper reaches of the Salween and Mekong rivers and crossing briefly into the Shan states in Burma. He then moved across country to Foochow (Fuzhou) and by steamer to Shanghai. During these years he travelled 11,000 miles on foot.<br>
<br>In September 1913 Pereira became a lieutenant-colonel in the reserve officers list, and being at home on the outbreak of war in 1914 he rejoined the service. He was posted to the staff of the 47th London division and went to France with them. In June 1915 he took command of the 4th Royal Welch Fusiliers and led them in the battle of Loos, where he was slightly wounded. From January 1916 until November 1917 he commanded the 47th brigade of the 16th division. In 1918 he commanded the 43rd brigade during the final advance of the allies. He was made CB in January 1917. He always won the absolute confidence of his troops by his complete disregard for danger. He retired at the end of the war with the rank of brigadier-general and in 1919 joined General Knox's mission to Admiral Kolchak in Siberia.<br>
<br>Pereira returned to China in 1920, over fifty-four years old, lame, in indifferent health, and with the goal of Lhasa in mind. As a schoolboy he had read the account by two French Lazarist missionaries, Evariste Huc and Joseph Gabet, of their journey to Lhasa in 1846, an achievement which had never been repeated by Europeans. He left Peking in January 1921 crossing the famine-stricken provinces of Chihli, Shensi (Shanxi), and Honan (Henan). He went to Honan Fu (Loyang) at the invitation of General Wu P'ei-fu in order to visit his model army. From July to October Pereira undertook three most arduous shooting trips in the wild mountainous district of Muping in Szechwan (Sichuan), hoping to shoot a giant panda, a rare animal that few Europeans had seen. He failed to get one but did shoot a pandar cat or red panda, equally rare, which was sent to the Natural History Museum at South Kensington. Because of the constant need to ford streams and climb slippery surfaces he discarded his boots and tried native sandals, but these gave his feet little protection and he was laid up in one town for seven weeks with a poisoned foot. In his last camp at 10,000 feet the cold and wet forced him to return to town, walking 48 miles in sandals through deep snow. He was again laid up, suffering from frost-bitten feet.<br>
<br>Pereira left Tangar in Kansu in May 1922, and reached Jyekundo on 23 June, after crossing an area with little food or grazing, and waterless in places. During this journey he lost most of his transport animals, but was fortunate in obtaining assistance from passing caravans. Chamdo was reached on 28 July after eighteen days of difficult travelling. On 3 September he received permission to proceed to Lhasa. The next six weeks were spent in a succession of journeys following valleys and crossing numerous passes, varying in height from 14,500 to 16,800 feet, scrambling over tracks covered with large boulders where the height above sea level made every step an exertion. Pereira arrived at Lhasa on 17 October, completely exhausted and suffering from thrombosis in his left leg. There he was comfortably housed by the Tibetan commander-in-chief, and had an interview with Tubten Gyatso, the great thirteenth Dalai Lama. He returned through Gyantse and Darjeeling, reaching Calcutta early in December, where he was treated in hospital for thrombosis.<br>
<br>In January 1923 Pereira left Calcutta for Bhamo in Burma, crossing into Yunnan, visiting Lolo and Miao areas, and then travelling down the Yangtze (Yangzi) to Shanghai which he reached on 13 May. He returned through Indo-China to Yunnan where he was joined by Dr H. G. Thompson and together they made their way to Batang in Szechwan. On the next stage of their journey to Kantze, Pereira became seriously ill and died from gastric ulcers on 20 October 1923. He was buried in the Chinese cemetery in the shadow of the Great Kantze Lamasery about 30 miles from the Tibetan border. His remains were later transferred to consecrated ground in the Roman Catholic mission at Tatsienlu (Dajianlu).<br>
<br>Pereira kept detailed diaries recording his travels and the people whom he met. Some of this material appeared in his articles written for the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>. These diaries are now in the Royal Geographical Society together with his photographs. An account of his journey from Peking to Lhasa was printed as an official report in 1923, but it was his friend Francis Younghusband who compiled <span class="italic">Peking to Lhasa: narrative of journeys in the Chinese empire made by the late Brigadier-General George Pereira</span> (1925).<br>
<br>Pereira was 5 feet 9 inches tall, lame, and not physically strong. He had, however, great energy, a genius for leadership, and an absolute determination to carry out his plans combined with an indifference to danger, discomfort, and fatigue. He was ready to talk about his journeys but in a purely impersonal manner. Although he had a very proper sense of self-respect, and was not a man to be trifled with, he had great charm and was modest with an innate courtesy and a dry sense of humour. &#145;It is lucky therefore that the brigands are so utterly ignorant of brigandage as a fine art&#146;. His experiences of brigands he described as &#145;a regular Gilbert and Sullivan opera&#146;. He spoke Mandarin Chinese and had some knowledge of dialects which made him independent of interpreters for all but Tibetan conversations. He was deeply religious and a devout Catholic, but with a broad sympathy for people of all kinds. Army life coupled with a restless spirit made him disinclined to a settled life and he never married though he remained devoted to his family.<br>
<br>Pereira's journeys, mostly on foot, through areas of eastern Tibet and western China rarely if ever crossed by Europeans covered almost 45,000 miles. They were made in unsettled times, frequently verging on civil war, and produced much new topographical and ethnographical information, including the first accounts of Mount Amne Machin. His reports confirmed the belief that the Himalayas end in Assam and Burma rather than extending into China. Had he lived he would have been recommended for the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
