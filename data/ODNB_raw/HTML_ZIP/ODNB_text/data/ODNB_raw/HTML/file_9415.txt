<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fiennes,  William</span>, first Viscount Saye and Sele  (1582&#150;1662), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Broughton Castle, Oxfordshire, on 28 May 1582, the only son and heir of Richard Fiennes, seventh Baron Saye and Sele (<i>c</i>.1557&#150;1613) and his first wife, Constance Kingsmill. He was educated at Winchester College and then at New College, Oxford, which he entered as a fellow-commoner in 1596, &#145;spending some time in logicals and philosophicals&#146; before being called home  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 1813&#150;20, 3.546). At both institutions he claimed to be founder's kin by virtue of his descent from one of William of Wykeham's sisters. About 1602 he married Elizabeth Temple (<i>d</i>. 1648), daughter of John Temple of Burton Dassett, Warwickshire, and Stowe, Buckinghamshire. Their third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9412/', "John Fiennes")</script>, became a parliamentarian officer and politician.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Fiennes succeeded his father as eighth Baron Saye and Sele in February 1613 and sat in the Lords from the 1614 parliament onwards. He first emerged to national prominence in the parliament of 1621, when he strongly urged that Lord Chancellor Bacon be summoned to the bar of the house to answer the charges against him, and later proposed (unsuccessfully) that Bacon should suffer degradation from the peerage in addition to his other punishments.<br>
<br>From his youth Saye was strongly drawn towards godly protestantism and during the later years of James I's reign he emerged as a prominent opponent of the king's pro-Spanish foreign policy. He donated money privately for the relief of James's daughter Elizabeth of Bohemia and her husband the elector Frederick. However Saye's constitutional principles were such that when in March 1622 the king and council requested the raising of a benevolence to aid the elector in regaining the Palatinate, Saye challenged the legality of such extra-parliamentary levies and refused to collect the benevolence in his capacity as a justice of the peace in Oxfordshire. As a result he was summoned before the privy council on four separate occasions between 23 May and 6 June, where he argued that he knew no justification for &#145;raising or levying mony of the subjects of England&#146; other than &#145;by their owne full and free consent in parliament&#146;  (Lincoln's Inn, Hale MS 12 [Selden Collection], no. 86, fol. 481). After his fourth hearing the council ordered Saye to be imprisoned in the Fleet prison for six months. Although following a direct appeal to Buckingham he was allowed to return to his estate at Norton in Gloucestershire in early February 1623, and then to Broughton in July, he was confined to the area within 20 miles of either estate until at least September of that year.<br>
<br>Saye's political fortunes improved temporarily when Prince Charles and the duke of Buckingham returned in October 1623 from their disastrous expedition to Madrid: their new-found determination to prosecute a war against Spain was now in tune with Saye's own long-standing anti-Spanish attitudes. In the 1624 parliament Saye followed Buckingham in vigorously attacking Lord Treasurer Middlesex, and through Buckingham's influence he was created Viscount Saye and Sele on 7 July 1624. However, in 1625 Buckingham began to fear that Saye was deserting him, and by the following year Saye was again distancing himself from the court. A staunch &#145;puritan&#146;, he was dismayed when King Charles and Buckingham associated themselves with the anti-Calvinists at the York House conference in February 1626. In the parliament of that year he strongly defended the privileges of the peerage against the king's attempts to exclude the earls of Bristol and Arundel from the Lords. He was also a leading figure in pressing for a standing order that reduced the number of proxies that any one peer could hold to two, a move clearly directed against Buckingham who at that time held no fewer than thirteen. In the autumn of 1626 Saye, together with about fifteen other peers, refused to pay the forced loan. In 1628 he was among the most energetic supporters of the petition of right in the Lords, and consistently opposed the various amendments and qualifications advocated by Buckingham and his allies. Saye's most decisive speech came on 24 May when, according to one diarist's account, he declared:<blockquote>It is the due right of the subject not to be committed without cause expressed. Not to recede from this &hellip; The refusing to join with [the Commons] in petition to enjoy this right will seem strange to posterity and make us hateful to posterity if we thus degenerate from our ancestors. I desire my name may be recorded amongst those Lords who shall agree to join with the Commons herein for preservation of our just rights. (Johnson and others, 5.524)</blockquote>According to another eyewitness Saye summed up the petition as &#145;no more than the just rights of the subjects of England&#146;  (ibid., 5.528). Having played an important role in securing the passage of the petition in the Lords, Saye was then less prominent during the short second session of the parliament in 1629, although he was appointed to a committee to draw up bills to prevent the decay of churches and chapels, and another to ensure sufficient stipends for curates.<h2>
<a name="CharlesIspersonalrule"></a>Charles I's personal rule</h2>The work of this short-lived committee coincided strongly with Saye's abiding interest in the promotion of a godly clergy. He was closely connected with distinguished puritan divines such as Richard Sibbes, John Preston, and John Davenport, and throughout his adult life was an active patron to an extensive circle of godly clergy. During the 1630s his growing friendship with Robert Greville, second Lord Brooke, brought him into contact with further networks of puritan ministers and laity who felt increasingly beleaguered by the onslaught of Laudian policies. As was evident in his sympathy for Elizabeth of Bohemia and the elector palatine, and his hostility towards Spain, these religious attitudes extended also into the international sphere and Saye felt a loyalty to the cause of Calvinists outside England. In July 1633, for example, he and Lord Brooke had a private conversation with the Dutch ambassador at Brooke House, a gesture that alarmed the king and some of his closest advisers.<br>
<br>During Charles I's personal rule Saye's godly religious attitudes and his alienation from the court led him to devote his energies principally to colonization schemes. In December 1630&#151;together with Brooke, John Pym, and other prominent puritan figures&#151;Saye established a company to settle Providence Island in the Caribbean. On 19 March 1632, in association with Brooke and ten others, he purchased from the earl of Warwick and the New England Company a large area of land on the Connecticut River. They appointed John Winthrop the younger as governor and set up a fort at the mouth of the river which they named Sayebrook (now spelt Saybrook). In 1633 Saye and Brooke also purchased a plantation in what is now New Hampshire from some Bristol merchants, and they both seriously considered settling in New England. However, in 1636 their proposal for the creation of a hereditary upper house was rebuffed by the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and Saye thereafter concentrated his efforts on encouraging emigrants to settle Providence Island. In March 1638 Saye and Brooke indicated their intention to travel to Providence Island as soon as possible, but in fact they never did so. Unfortunately the puritan settlers in Providence Island soon became hopelessly factionalized and engaged extensively in privateering and the use of slaves. The company failed to replicate the representative assemblies and private ownership of land that were so crucial to the success of the New England colonies, and the settlement was destroyed by the Spanish in 1641 without ever having become really successful. By that time the company was deeply in debt and Saye himself owed bonds worth a total of &pound;1190. In due course Saye surrendered his rights in New England: the New Hampshire settlements were transferred to Massachusetts in 1641, and Sayebrook was sold to Connecticut in 1644.<br>
<br>Closer to home, Saye once again proved an inveterate opponent of extra-parliamentary taxation, and he led the resistance to ship money in Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. In Lincolnshire his goods were distrained, and he sued the constable and the sheriff for acting illegally. In retaliation, on 28 June 1637 the privy council ordered the attorney-general to proceed against him in Star Chamber for allegedly depopulating three farms in Lincolnshire and enclosing an ox pasture, although apparently no action was taken. Saye, acting on Oliver St John's legal advice, wanted to bring his case to court, insisting that the writ for levying ship money was illegal. However, the king and council were reluctant to take on such an eminent figure, and when Saye's nephew Sir Peter Temple, sheriff of Buckinghamshire, returned a list of ship money defaulters headed by the comparatively obscure John Hampden, Charles permitted that case to come to court instead. It is possible that Saye agreed to withdraw his own case on the understanding that Hampden's case would be allowed to test the legality of ship money.<h2>
<a name="ThebishopswarsandtheShortParliament"></a>The bishops' wars and the Short Parliament</h2>Saye's deep hostility towards Laudian policies was associated at the end of the 1630s with a corresponding sympathy towards the Scottish covenanters. In the spring of 1639 he accepted only with great reluctance the king's summons to York for the first campaign against the Scots. When Charles demanded that all English peers take a military oath committing their lives and fortunes to the maintenance of the struggle, Saye and Brooke queried the legality and wording of the oath. On 21 April both peers publicly refused to take the oath at a meeting of nobles at York. When his turn came, Saye:<blockquote>rose upp and secondly kneeled downe and told his Majesty that he would take the Oath of Allegeance and Supreamacy, to adventur his lyfe and fortunes for the defence of this kingdome of England against any that should invade it. But to goe and kill a man in Scotland he was not satisfyed of the lawfullness therof. (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 507)</blockquote>The king interviewed both Saye and Brooke but when they refused to relent he ordered them to be imprisoned and interrogated. However, the crown's lawyers could find no reason to punish them and after four days' confinement both peers were sent home and restricted to their estates during the king's pleasure.<br>
<br>Following his decision in February 1640 to recall parliament for the following April, Charles attempted to deny Saye, Brooke, and Edward Montagu, Lord Mandeville, their writs of summons, but was persuaded to relent, possibly by Algernon Percy, earl of Northumberland. On 24 April Saye was among the minority of twenty-five peers who sided with the Commons in refusing to grant supply before redress of grievances, and entered their dissents when the majority in the Lords rallied to the king. Alone among the peers Saye spoke out directly against Charles's appeal to the Lords not to join with the Commons. Following the parliament's dissolution on 5 May, Saye, Brooke, Pym, and John Hampden were imprisoned and their studies were searched for documents that might reveal treasonable dealings with the Scots. But Saye was too wary to have left such evidence and, although probably complicit in encouraging the Scots to invade England in the summer of 1640, he refused to sign the proposed letter of invitation. However, many at court remained deeply suspicious of him and towards the end of that year Strafford was advising Charles to begin treason proceedings against Saye and his allies when he was himself arrested and put on trial. In August 1640 Saye was one of the twelve peers who petitioned Charles to recall parliament, complaining of various &#145;evils and dangers&#146;, including the king's &#145;present expedition against the Scottish army&#146;; &#145;the sundry innovations in matters of religion&#146;; &#145;the urging of Ship Money&#146;; and &#145;the great grief of your subjects by the long intermission of Parliaments&#146;  (S. R. Gardiner, ed., <span class="italic">Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution, 1625&#150;1660</span>, 3rd edn, 1906, 134&#150;6).<h2>
<a name="TheLongParliament"></a>The Long Parliament</h2>In the early months of the Long Parliament Saye was among the peers whom Charles attempted to win over with appointments to high offices. On 19 February 1641&#151;along with such other prominent &#145;opposition&#146; peers as the earls of Bristol, Bedford, Essex, and Hertford and lords Mandeville and Savile&#151;Saye was appointed a privy councillor. He also became master of the court of wards on 17 May, and one of the commissioners for the treasury four days later. But such preferment failed to secure his compliance. In the Lords he supported the earl of Strafford's attainder, and on 24 May he urged that bishops and clergy be restrained from interfering in secular matters, arguing that in the upper house the bishops &#145;have such an absolute dependency upon the King, that they sit not here as freemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Speeches in Parliament</span>, 5). In another speech the same year he criticized the rigidity of the Church of England and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and denounced attempts to impose &#145;certaine prayers and formes of divine service &hellip; upon all persons, in all times, and upon all occasions to be used and none other&#146;. This &#145;injunction of such formes upon all men&#146; was, he argued, &#145;as if because some men had need to make use of crutches, all men should bee prohibited the use of legges, and injoyned to take up such crutches as have been prepared for those who had no legges&#146;  (ibid., 10). However, Saye vehemently rebutted the charge that he was &#145;the greatest separatist in England&#146;, and asserted that the &#145;separatists' failing is in this, they hold that there is no true Church in England, no true ministry, no true worship&#146;  (ibid., 13). Late in June he was among the majority in the Lords who supported the bill for the abolition of the court of Star Chamber. Towards the end of the following month it was rumoured in London that Saye might be appointed lord treasurer (with Pym as chancellor of the exchequer and Hampden as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster), and during the king's visit to Scotland between August and November 1641 Saye served as one of the commissioners of regency.<br>
<br>As the civil war approached Saye was one of the peers who consistently supported the Commons' demands. Early in December he supported the Commons' impressment bill authorizing conscription of an army to suppress the Irish rising against those peers who argued that this measure encroached upon the royal prerogative to raise armed forces. On 24 December 1641 Saye entered his protest against the peers' vote to postpone consideration of the Commons' declaration for the &#145;good and safety of the King and kingdom&#146; demanding the removal of Sir Thomas Lunsford as lieutenant of the Tower of London  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4, 1628&#150;42, 489&#150;90). When the Lords voted on 17 January 1642 not to join the Commons in demanding that Sir John Conyers be appointed lieutenant of the Tower, Saye entered his dissent. Similarly on 24 January, when the Lords refused to support the Commons' request that fortresses and the militia be placed in the hands of persons in whom parliament could confide, Saye was among those who protested. When the militia ordinance was passed on 5 March 1642 Saye was nominated as lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire, Cheshire, and Gloucestershire. The following month he ignored a summons from the king, issued to several privy councillors, to join him at York.<br>
<br>Equally there are tantalizing glimpses that Saye had tried not to sever his links with the court completely until this point. A record survives of a warrant on 28 December 1641 to issue &pound;1200 to Saye, &#145;which he is forthwith to disburse in His Mats. speciall and private service according to his Mats. direccons already given him therein&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SO 3/12, Signet office docket book, fol. 179<i>r</i>). &pound;40 was paid on this warrant on 5 May 1642. It is intriguing that in January 1642, when the duke of Richmond (who was of the blood royal) created a furore by proposing that the Long Parliament be adjourned for six months and was required to &#145;make an humble submission and acknowledgement&#146;, Saye did not join Essex, Pembroke, Warwick, Wharton, Brooke and seventeen other peers in protesting that this was &#145;not a sufficient punishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4, 1628&#150;42, 543). On 12 April Saye reported to the Lords a message from the earl of Dorset, the queen's lord chamberlain, stating that he was absent from the Lords because of ill health and would not join the king at York without the Lords' permission. In the event, Dorset arrived at York in May, and the fact that Saye had conveyed this message from a prominent royalist suggests that he may have retained some contacts with the court. However, events were moving rapidly towards armed conflict: on 10 June Saye pledged to donate &pound;1000 for the raising of troops for the houses' cause, and on 4 July he was one of five peers appointed to a committee of safety comprised jointly of members of the Lords and Commons.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwars"></a>The civil wars</h2>Saye's political influence continued to grow after the outbreak of the civil war. In August 1642 he raised a regiment of troops and in the following month occupied Oxford, where he had been high steward of the university since July 1641. He then joined the parliamentarian forces at Edgehill, and shortly after the battle Broughton Castle surrendered to the royalists. Charles exempted Saye from pardon on 3 November 1642, and in the following March the king refused to grant him safe conduct to act as one of the parliamentarian peace commissioners at the treaty of Oxford. On 12 June 1643 Saye was appointed to the Westminster assembly of divines. He attended the assembly frequently and soon emerged as a prominent Erastian Independent who wished to extend religious toleration and whose hostility towards presbyterianism (as towards episcopacy) rested on a deep vein of anticlericalism.<br>
<br>Saye's Independent attitudes aligned him with a number of close political allies in both houses of parliament, the most important of whom were Oliver St John, Sir Henry Vane the younger, Sir John Evelyn of Wiltshire, Oliver Cromwell, and Saye's own second son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9413/', "Nathaniel Fiennes")</script> in the Commons, and lords Wharton and Howard of Escrick, and the earls of Kent, Northumberland, Salisbury, and Denbigh in the Lords. These figures formed the core of a political &#145;interest&#146; committed to a decisive victory over the king. To this end Saye was prepared to support the solemn league and covenant of September 1643 which established a military alliance between the parliamentarians and the Scots. It is likely that in February 1644 Saye, along with his allies in the Commons such as St John and the younger Vane, supported the creation of the first committee of both kingdoms. Sir John Berkenhead, author of the royalist newsbook <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, alleged that Saye was one of the &#145;first authors of this new committee&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 7th week, 11&#150;17 Feb 1644, 828 [mispaginated as 825], BL, E 35/27). The Scottish minister Robert Baillie likewise reported that the proposal &#145;was gotten through the House of Lords with little difficultie, where most was expected; my Lord Say &hellip; being somewhat of the generall&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, ed. D. Laing, 3 vols., 1841&#150;2, 2.141, 18 Feb 1644). These reports are suggestive, although there appears to be no evidence in the surviving parliamentary record to prove conclusively that Saye actually introduced the bill that established the new committee, a move that followed immediately upon a Scottish request, reported to the Lords by Essex, for the appointment of commissioners to consider &#145;the managing of the affairs of both kingdoms&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 6, 1643&#150;4, 405). Saye was among the peers appointed to the committee and he was also named to the second committee of both kingdoms, created in May 1644. Thereafter he assiduously attended the committee's meetings (and from 1648 those of its successor, the Derby House committee), and he regularly acted as a messenger between these committees and the Lords.<br>
<br>The committee of both kingdoms henceforth assumed wide-ranging executive powers, and this had the effect of eroding the authority of the earl of Essex, the parliamentarian lord-general. Essex's authority was finally brought to an end by the military reforms of the winter of 1644&#150;5, notably the self-denying ordinance and the creation of the New Model Army, and Saye was among the supporters of these measures. The self-denying ordinance was brought up to the Lords from the Commons on 21 December 1644 and when it was rejected on 13 January 1645 Saye was one of only four peers (along with Kent, Nottingham, and Northumberland) who registered their dissent.<br>
<br>The Commons was meanwhile considering a scheme for &#145;new modelling&#146; the army, with Sir Thomas Fairfax as its commander-in-chief: this ordinance was sent to the Lords on 28 January and accepted by them on 15 February. On 17&#150;18 March the Lords divided 11:11 over whether to accept Fairfax's proposed list of officers, which contained a number of prominent Independents. Saye produced the proxy of the aged and absent earl of Mulgrave (who was Fairfax's grandfather), and thereby swung the vote in favour of accepting the list  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 7, 1644&#150;5, 276&#150;7). Saye was also among the peers (along with the earls of Northumberland, Kent, Pembroke, Nottingham, and Salisbury, and lords Wharton, North, and Howard of Escrick) who sided with the Commons in urging that Fairfax's commission should not include a clause for &#145;preserving the safety of His Majesty's person&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 7, 1644&#150;5, 293), like the one contained in the original commission to Essex as lord-general. Twice, on 29 and 31 March, Saye again used Mulgrave's proxy to produce an even division in the Lords. Finally, on 1 April the earl of Bolingbroke transferred his vote, enabling Saye and his allies to win the day and ensuring that the Lords agreed to the Commons' request that the clause be dropped. On 3 April the Lords also accepted the new self-denying ordinance which the Commons had sent up on 31 March.<br>
<br>Saye's important contribution to the new modelling of the parliamentarian army continued with his appointment, on 31 March 1645, to the new bicameral army committee. Here he again found himself co-operating closely with like-minded peers (especially Northumberland, Pembroke, Salisbury, Kent, Wharton, and Howard of Escrick) as well as allies in the Commons (notably St John, Vane the younger, John Glynne, Robert Scawen, and Sir John Evelyn of Wiltshire). As the committee responsible for overseeing the collection of the assessment and providing the army with pay and provisions, the army committee had considerable opportunities to dispense patronage. Between 1645 and 1648 Saye and his allies also became prominent members of some of parliament's other bicameral committees, including the committee of revenue which in effect controlled the exchequer. It was unsurprising that when the court of wards was abolished in February 1646, Saye was granted &pound;10,000 as compensation for the mastership. As satisfaction for &pound;4000 of that sum he received Lord Cottington's estate at Hanworth in Middlesex that was in reality worth &pound;14,000. Following the royalist surrender in June 1646, Saye was appointed one of the commissioners for parliament to treat with the Scots.<h2>
<a name="Thesearchforsettlement"></a>The search for settlement</h2>During the months that followed Saye and his allies in both houses became steadily more disillusioned with the dominant presbyterian grouping within parliament led by Denzil Holles. Saye's hostility towards Holles was of long standing, and he was suspected of having put Lord Savile up to accusing Holles and Bulstrode Whitelocke of backstairs intrigues with the royalists during the treaty of Uxbridge in 1645. Saye and his allies particularly resented presbyterian attempts, in the spring and summer of 1647, to disband the majority of the army without guaranteed payment of arrears and to send the remnant to Ireland. When rioters sympathetic to the presbyterian leadership besieged the Palace of Westminster on 26 July 1647 Saye was among the eight Independent peers who, along with fifty-seven Independent members of the Commons and the speakers of both houses, fled to the protection of the army at Hounslow Heath. These members of both houses subsequently signed an engagement on 4 August defending their conduct and the justness of Fairfax's march into London to restore &#145;the honour and freedom of the Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 9, 1646&#150;7, 385). The army entered London two days later, and the members who had fled resumed their seats. From then until early 1648 Saye, Northumberland, and their allies generally formed a majority in the Lords and were able to seize the initiative to a greater extent than had been possible hitherto.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, leading Independents in each house, together with their allies within the army such as Cromwell and Henry Ireton, had also been collaborating for several weeks on drafting and promoting their own terms for a settlement, known as <span class="italic">The Heads of Proposals</span>. These terms offered Charles an alternative to the Newcastle propositions backed by the dominant presbyterian group, and enshrined the political and religious aims of the Independents. From Charles's point of view they were significantly more generous than the Newcastle propositions. They required that the houses nominate the officers of state and control the militia for ten years (rather than twenty), that only seven royalists be exempted from pardon (rather than fifty-eight), and that episcopacy be preserved provided that it was shorn of coercive powers and did not infringe religious liberty of conscience. Such terms coincided with Saye's attitudes as an Erastian Independent, and with his commitment to a balanced polity in which crown, Lords, and Commons wielded co-ordinate powers. The latter conviction made him wary of simply transferring responsibilities from the monarch to the houses. The heads were unusual among the peace terms of the 1640s in departing from that principle by requiring biennial parliaments, revoking the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span>, and reducing the period of parliamentary control over the militia and the appointment of officers of state.<br>
<br>Saye's role in drafting and promoting these proposals remains highly controversial. In particular, the surviving evidence does not prove that he oversaw the drafting of the first recension of the heads, or that he co-ordinated a sequence of meetings between army officers and the civilian Independents shortly before the army council adopted a revised recension at the beginning of August 1647, or that he masterminded the presentation of the terms to the king. The likelihood is that Saye was one of the peers, like Northumberland and Wharton, who were consulted over the terms and who were sympathetic to them, but that the actual drafting of the various recensions of the heads was performed primarily by Henry Ireton. A number of contemporaries, including Charles and some of his leading advisers, perceived the heads as &#145;the proposals of the army&#146;  (for example <span class="italic">JHL</span>, 10, 1647&#150;8, 434&#150;5), but Saye was a prominent member of the Independent coalition which backed the terms, and they were probably an accurate reflection of the basis on which he hoped that a post-war settlement with Charles might be constructed.<br>
<br>Following the members' return to Westminster early in August and the king's rejection of the Newcastle propositions in mid-September, Saye was among the leading Independents in both houses who promoted a series of resolutions and propositions intended to embody the central elements of the heads. This process involved intensive collaboration by a familiar bicameral grouping of Independents, prompting Sir Lewis Dyve to inform the king early in September that &#145;Cromwell and his Cabbinett Counsell, which are the Lord Say, Saint Jon and Vaine the younger, now steer the affaires of the wholl kingdome&#146;  (Sir Lewis Dyve to Charles I, 5 Sept 1647, &#145;The Tower of London letter-book of Sir Lewis Dyve, 1646&#150;47&#146;, ed. H. G. Tibbutt, Bedfordshire Historical RS, 38, 1958, 84). Saye, Wharton, and their allies now commanded a majority in the Lords, and they worked in close collaboration with their allies in the Commons led by Fiennes, Cromwell, St John, Evelyn, and the younger Vane. These Independents also maintained close links with the army and Saye was present at Putney, conferring with senior officers, during the opening days of the Putney debates at the end of October.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards, on 11 November, the political landscape changed once again when Charles escaped from Hampton Court. In an effort to keep negotiations alive, and to counter the sense of indignation felt within the army, Saye was among the peers who supported the presentation of a set of minimum terms to the king. On 25 November the Lords identified four propositions which were accepted by the Commons two days later and converted into bills. These four bills, presented to Charles on 24 December, required him to accept parliamentary control over the armed forces for twenty years, the voiding of all royalist declarations against the houses, the cancellation of peerages granted since May 1642 without parliament's consent, and the confirmation of parliament's right to adjourn to any place of its own choice. However, two days later Charles signed an engagement with commissioners representing his new-found allies among the Scots, with whom he had been secretly negotiating for several weeks. On 28 December he rejected the four bills, thereby wrecking the conciliatory strategy of Saye and his allies. Deeply disappointed, the houses passed the vote of no addresses, breaking off negotiations with Charles. Saye was apparently sympathetic to this vote, although he was not present in the Lords on the day that the house passed it (17 January 1648).<br>
<br>In the spring of 1648 Saye was involved in a further attempt to reach a settlement with Charles and to dissuade him from his alliance with the Scots. This was a highly risky strategy as it involved a direct breach of the vote of no addresses. In mid-March Saye was rumoured to be in the Isle of Wight, and in the last week of that month he met St John, Evelyn, and Fiennes at Wallingford. They attempted to persuade the earl of Southampton &#145;to goe to the King to make way for a Treaty&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 31, fol. 51<i>r</i>, letter of intelligence, 13 April 1648), but the earl declined to violate the vote of no addresses. Saye was absent from the Lords between 6 March and 20 April and on his return to London he tried to mobilize as much support as possible for continued negotiations. But these attempts were rapidly overtaken by the outbreak of the second civil war. As the army faced a series of provincial uprisings and an invasion from Scotland, many officers became more and more convinced that Charles should be brought to account as a &#145;man of blood&#146;.<br>
<br>Yet Saye, like the majority of members of both houses, could not envisage any lasting settlement without the king. The vote of no addresses was therefore repealed on 24 August, and Saye was among the fifteen parliamentarian commissioners appointed to treat with the king at Newport in September (alongside Northumberland, Pembroke, Middlesex, and Salisbury). During the treaty Saye was reported to be &#145;the most inward man with the King&#146;: he was &#145;very intimate&#146; with Richmond, and &#145;by him &hellip; [Saye] conveyed his intelligence still to the King. Hee was so confident of the succes of the Treatie, that hee had bespoke himselfe to bee Lord Treasurer&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Dep. c. 169, MS Nalson, fol. 181<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). When the treaty was adjourned for a few days early in November, Saye returned to London and lobbied actively for the talks. But his efforts were in vain: on 6 December, Colonel Pride purged the Commons, and Nathaniel Fiennes was among the forty-five imprisoned members. Saye's influence with Fairfax secured his son's early release but with the path now cleared for the king's trial and execution Saye's hopes for a settlement had been abruptly dashed. He did not attend the Lords after 7 December; on 23 December he and twenty-seven other peers were summoned to attend the house on 28 December, but when the appointed day arrived he neither appeared nor requested leave for absence. His political influence was at an end, and to add to his woes his wife had also died in 1648 and was buried in the church at Broughton. Deeply dispirited, Saye withdrew from public affairs and apparently retired to his retreat on the Isle of Lundy in the Bristol Channel.<h2>
<a name="Theinterregnumretirementandreflection"></a>The interregnum: retirement and reflection</h2>Saye was certainly on Lundy in 1651 when a royalist privateer who had captured one of his ships wrote a letter to him; he was apparently still there two years later, when Dorothy Osborne wrote that &#145;My Lord Saye as I am tolde has writ a Romance since his retirement in the Isle of Lundee&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of Dorothy Osborne to William Temple</span>, ed. G. C. Moore Smith, 1928, 91, letter 40, undated [2 Oct 1653]). The following year saw the publication of an anonymous work, the <span class="italic">Vindiciae veritatis</span>, and it is possible that Osborne's comment referred to this. If so, it was either incorrect or ironic, for the <span class="italic">Vindiciae</span> was no romance but a lengthy polemical text that offered both a sustained defence of the political and religious views associated with Saye and his allies and an account of the civil wars from their viewpoint. It also presents a detailed apology for the conduct of Saye's son, Nathaniel Fiennes. The <span class="italic">Vindiciae</span> has often traditionally been attributed to Fiennes; it has also been plausibly ascribed to Saye himself; and it is even possible that it was, at least in part, co-authored. Internal evidence suggests that large sections of it were written in 1646 and reworked in 1648. The <span class="italic">Vindiciae</span> advocated the co-ordinate powers of crown, Lords, and Commons, a view that Saye had held since at least 1640. The treatise also revealed a marked strain of anticlericalism against both bishops and presbyterians which, together with the crucial role accorded to the Lords as a balance between crown and Commons, affords further clear resemblances to Saye's own attitudes.<br>
<br>Saye's view of the constitution was clearly set out in a letter that he wrote to his friend Lord Wharton on 29 December 1657 explaining why he felt unable to accept Cromwell's invitation to join the &#145;other house&#146; created by &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146;. He argued that English government was &#145;the best in the worlde&#146; because it was:<blockquote>a mixture of the three lawfull governments in that manner that it hath the quintessence of them all, and thearby also the one is a boundary unto the other, whearby they are keapt from fallinge into the extreames which eather are apt to slippe into, monarchy into tyranny, and aristocracy into oligarchy, democracy into anarchy.</blockquote>In maintaining this balance, the House of Lords played a vital role as &#145;the beame keepinge both scales, Kinge and people, in an even posture, without incroachments one uppon another to the hurt and dammage of both&#146;. Saye deplored the idea of a nominated &#145;other house&#146; on the grounds that it was &#145;a stalkinge horse and vizard to carry on the designe of overthrowinge the House of Peeres&#146; and replace it with a chamber hand-picked by Cromwell. Such an invitation, he felt, could only be to the &#145;perpetual shame&#146; of those who accepted it  (&#145;A letter from Lord Saye and Sele&#146;, 106&#150;7).<br>
<br>Saye appears to have spent the later years of the protectorate back at Broughton. In March 1658 a royalist agent reported that Saye, although sympathetic to the king, felt that any restoration of the Stuarts should be conditional upon &#145;a confirmation of the articles of the Isle of Wight, or something equivalent&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers Collected by Edward, Earl of Clarendon</span>, 3 vols., 1767, 3.392). In the following year Saye published a bitter denunciation of the Quakers, <span class="italic">Folly and Madnesse Made Manifest</span> (1659). It is possible that fear of a Quaker uprising helped to make Saye, like many others, more amenable to the idea of the king's return. By 1660 Saye had accepted the restoration of Charles II without conditions, and when the Convention met on 25 April he was one of ten former parliamentarian peers who entered the Lords for the first time in eleven years.<h2>
<a name="TheRestoration"></a>The Restoration</h2>Keen to woo his old political opponents, Charles II appointed Saye a privy councillor in June 1660, although the story that he was also made keeper of the privy seal appears to be unfounded. Saye retained his interest in the New England colonies, and was appointed a member of the committee for plantations (4 July 1660) and of the committee to settle the government of New England (17 May 1661). Near the end of his life he wrote from London to the governor of Massachusetts on 10 July 1661:<blockquote>I was loth to omit writing, because it may be my last, my glass being almost run out, and I retiring home &hellip; I have not been wanting, both to the King and Council, to advance your interest; more I cannot do, but earnestly to pray the Lord to stand with you and for you. (T. Hutchinson, <span class="italic">The History of the Colony of Massachuset's Bay</span>, Boston, 1765, 220&#150;21)</blockquote>Saye died at Broughton Castle on 14 April 1662, a few weeks before his eightieth birthday, and was buried in the church at Broughton. He was succeeded by his eldest son, James (<i>c</i>.1603&#150;1684). His will, dated 3 March 1659, was proved on 19 November 1662. He left an extensive library, valued for probate at &pound;500.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Saye's contemporaries recognized his considerable influence, especially during the 1640s, and even his avowed ideological opponents acknowledged his political agility. The author of the royalist newsbook <span class="italic">Mercurius Elencticus</span> observed: &#145;He's as smooth as a butter-box. Oh how the Presbyterians sneare in their sleeves to see with what dexterity this spider weaves his nets to catch the silly flies of the Army&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Elencticus</span>, no. 2, 5&#150;12 Nov 1647, 11, BL, E 414/4). In January 1648 Marchamont Nedham wrote that Saye:<blockquote>with a twine thread leads about our wise nobility &hellip; He hath a footing in every Juncto, maintaines a correspond with every conventicle, and preserves an interest in every faction; hath oportunity to kisse and betray all in a breath, and is the only modern copie of the ancient Janus, that can looke forward and backward to watch all advantages. (<span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, no. 19, 18&#150;25 Jan 1648, sig. T2<i>v</i>, BL, E 423/21)</blockquote>Clarendon summed up Saye's importance thus:<blockquote>[he] gave over any pursuit in Court, and lived narrowly and sordidly in the country, having conversation with very few but such who had great malignity against the Church and State, and fomented their inclinations, and gave them instructions how to behave themselves with caution and to do their business with most security, and was in truth the pilot that steered all those vessels which were freighted with sedition to destroy the government. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.548)</blockquote>In another passage Clarendon wrote that Saye &#145;had for many years been the oracle of those who were called Puritans in the worst sense, and steered all their counsels and designs. He was a notorious enemy of the Church and to most of the eminent churchmen&#146;  (ibid., 1.241).<br>
<br>Overall, Saye's contemporary nickname, Old Subtlety, was highly appropriate, for he was an adroit and skilful politician with a real talent for intrigue and manoeuvre. His political behaviour is often difficult to reconstruct fully, partly because the surviving evidence is incomplete but also because his deftness sometimes left little more than intriguing glimpses in the historical record. His personality and life were in many ways full of paradoxes. Saye was a man of emphatic views and high principles, whose political influence often remains elusive and enigmatic. He had a lengthy political career, yet his real period of prominence on the national stage lasted for only a decade during the 1640s. He was someone who constantly sought peace, yet who achieved his greatest eminence in a time of war and who regarded a decisive victory over Charles as necessary for a lasting settlement. In the end he epitomized many of the agonies and dilemmas of the turbulent age in which he lived: his life offers an illuminating case study of sincere and principled opposition to Charles I, an unsuccessful search for a settlement, an inability to come to terms with the republic, and eventually an acceptance of the restoration of the monarchy.<br>
