<span class="headword">Keys,  William Herbert</span>  (1923&#150;1990), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 1 January 1923 at Elliotts Row, Elephant and Castle, London, the third child and second son in the family of four sons and one daughter of George William Keys, printer, and his wife, Jessie Powell. His elder brother and sister died before he was born. He spent his childhood in the Elephant and Castle and was educated at Archbishop Temple Grammar School there. He joined the army in 1939 and served in the rifle brigade throughout the Second World War, until 1946. He had a distinguished war record, becoming one of the youngest sergeant-majors. At one period in the war, cut off near the Nijmegen Bridge, he was behind enemy lines for several days with a handful of his men. He was among the first allied troops to enter Belsen concentration camp. This and his other wartime experiences confirmed his profound dedication to world peace, his total rejection of fascism, and his passionate support for nuclear disarmament.<br>
<br>Bill Keys started his career in the printing works of the Amalgamated Press, Summer Street, London, but in 1953 he became a full-time official of the National Union of Printing, Bookbinding, and Paperworkers when he was appointed national organizer. From 1961 to 1970 he was the secretary of the union's London central branch, while from 1970 to 1974 he was the general president of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT). On 1 January 1975 he became general secretary of SOGAT, a post he held until he retired in 1985. He served on the general council of the Trades Union Congress for eleven years from 1974.<br>
<br>Keys was a highly successful general secretary of SOGAT and its constituent unions and became one of the foremost leaders in the wider trade union movement. On becoming general secretary, he changed SOGAT from being an inward-looking organization to one which became involved in mainstream issues. He believed strongly that it had a role and responsibility to be active within the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and society at large. He was always an internationalist and forged links with unions throughout the world, not only in the printing sphere but on a much broader basis. His stamina and tenacity made him a formidable negotiator, with the ability to take apart the most complex wage structure and put forward a solution to disputes. He was especially renowned for his habit of kicking off his shoes during the hard negotiating sessions with employers.<br>
<br>Of Keys's many achievements, two stand out. He won a great victory for the continuation of his union's political fund, threatened by the <span class="roman">Trade Union Act</span> of 1984, which enforced periodic ballots on the issue. He spearheaded and co-ordinated the political fund ballots in trade unions&#151;one of the few successes of the trade union movement in the years of the government of Margaret Thatcher. SOGAT was the first union to go to ballot and other unions followed. The other was his commitment to the creation of one union for the printing industry. He achieved a number of steps along this way with the merger in 1975 of the Scottish Graphical Association and SOGAT and then in 1982 of NATSOPA and SOGAT. Although his ultimate goal of one union evaded him before his retirement and death, he had put in place the basis of the SOGAT/NGA amalgamation, which took place in October 1991.<br>
<br>For all his successes, Keys's biggest disappointment was his failure to persuade his old London central branch members in Fleet Street to accept modernization and new technology. If the &#145;programme of action&#146; which he devised in 1977 had been accepted, the move of newspapers to Wapping and the demise of Fleet Street would not have happened in the brutal way it did. He foresaw what would ensue and wanted to avoid it.<br>
<br>On the wider trade union scene Keys made a significant contribution to TUC policy making at a national level, particularly in the role of chairman of the employment policy committee (1976&#150;85) and of the printing industries committee (1974&#150;85). He also presided over the TUC media committee (1977&#150;85) and the equal rights committee (1974&#150;85), and served on the race relations committee (1974&#150;85) and the finance and general purposes committee (1982&#150;5), which is regarded as the TUC's &#145;inner cabinet&#146;. As one of the elder statesmen of the TUC, he was the trade union nominee for the committee of inquiry which resolved the national steel strike (1980) and the national water strike (1983). He was one of the seven senior TUC leaders who tried to resolve the miners' strike of 1984&#150;5. He was also the TUC nominee on the Commission for Racial Equality (1977&#150;81), the Manpower Services Commission (1979&#150;85), and the Central Arbitration Committee (from 1972). From 1981 to 1985 he was on the TUC&#150;Labour Party liaison committee, and he was a leading light in the trades unions for a Labour victory organization.<br>
<br>Keys was warm, generous, and compassionate. He was well built, 6 feet in height, and some 13 stone in weight. In 1941 he married Enid, daughter of William Gleadhill, who travelled all over the world doing many jobs, including work in the oilfields of the Persian Gulf. They had two sons, Ian and Keith. He died of heart trouble on 19 May 1990 at his home, 242 Maplin Way, North Thorpe Bay, Essex.<br>
