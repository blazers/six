<span class="headword">Chase,  Marian Emma</span>  (1844&#150;1905), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born on 18 April 1844 at 62 Upper Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, London, the second of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5180/', "John C. Chase (1810&#150;1879)")</script>, watercolour painter, and his second wife, Georgiana Ann Harris (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1818). Her sister Jessie (<i>fl</i>. 1885&#150;6) was also an artist. Marian Chase was educated at a private school in Ham, near Richmond. Her father, who was a member of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, taught her perspective and watercolour painting; Margaret Gillies gave her instruction in figure drawing; and she enjoyed the friendship and advice of Henry Warren, president of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, E. H. Wehnert, G. W. Mote, Henry Tidey, and other artists.<br>
<br>In early life Chase devoted much time to illuminating, but it is as a painter in watercolour of flowers, fruit, and still life that she became best known; she was praised for careful detail, delicacy of touch, and effective use of colour. She also painted a few landscapes, and towards the end of her life exhibited picturesque flower gardens and detailed interiors with figures. She worked occasionally in oil. Marian Chase exhibited at the Liverpool Academy (1865), Royal Academy (1866&#150;77), Dudley Gallery (1866&#150;71), Society of Female Artists (1866&#150;92), Society of British Artists (1868&#150;71), Royal Hibernian Academy (1870&#150;98), and Institute of Painters in Oil Colours (1884). She was also represented at the Universal Exhibition of 1871, the Paris Exhibition of 1889, and at exhibitions in Melbourne, Australia, and Philadelphia, USA. The vast majority of her paintings however&#151;a total of 275&#151;appeared at the Institute of Painters in Water Colours (1875&#150;1905); she was elected an associate of the institute on 22 March 1875, and became a full member in 1879. In 1888 the Royal Botanical Society awarded her a silver medal. Among her most celebrated paintings were <span class="italic">Neglecting her Work</span> (exh. International Exhibition, 1871), <span class="italic">Nature and Art</span> (exh. RA, 1873), <span class="italic">Springtime</span> (exh. RA, 1874), and <span class="italic">Summertime</span> (exh. Institute of Painters in Water Colours, 1875). <span class="italic">Music, Literature and Art</span> (exh. RHA, 1886), priced at &pound;100, was an ambitious work. Apart from a tour abroad with her father about 1876, Marian Chase worked entirely in England. Having occupied various addresses in Charlotte Street, London, in 1880 the family moved to Haddon Lodge, Quex Road, and in 1886 to 18 Christchurch Road, Brondesbury, where Marian Chase worked in a large studio. After a &#145;quiet and uneventful life&#146;  (<span class="italic">St John's Wood, Kilburn and Hampstead Advertiser</span>, 29 Aug 1901, 5) she died, unmarried, at 285 Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale, from heart failure, following an operation, on 15 March 1905; she was buried on 20 March in St Pancras cemetery, Finchley. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museum hold examples of Chase's work.<br>
