<span class="headword">Howard,  Bernard Marmaduke  Fitzalan-</span>, sixteenth duke of Norfolk  (1908&#150;1975), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born at Arundel Castle on 30 May 1908, the only son (there were also three daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34020/', "Henry Fitzalan-Howard, fifteenth duke of Norfolk (1847&#150;1917)")</script>, and his second wife, Gwendolen Mary Constable-Maxwell (1877&#150;1945), daughter of Marmaduke Francis, eleventh Lord Herries of Terregles, and heir of that Scottish title. He succeeded to the dukedom in 1917, his half-brother from a previous marriage having died in 1902. He was educated privately and at the Oratory School, Birmingham.<br>
<br>The young duke, whose hereditary duties as earl marshal were performed until 1929 by his uncle, Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, was commissioned into the 4th (territorial) battalion of the Royal Sussex regiment early in 1928, but at the end of that year transferred to the Royal Horse Guards, with whom he was not happy. He returned gladly to the Sussex regiment in 1934, rising to the rank of major and serving in France and at Dunkirk in 1940. He succeeded his mother as thirteenth Lord Herries of Terregles in 1945. His interests were emphatically those of a countryman; he loved hunting, shooting, racing, and cricket, and in 1936 became master of the Holderness hunt. He was sworn of the privy council in 1936. He married on 27 January 1937 <a href="#cosubject_60378">the Hon. Lavinia Mary Strutt [<i>see below</i>]</a>; they had four daughters, the eldest of whom succeeded to the Scottish barony of Herries. In 1938 he sold Norfolk House on the corner of St James's Square, London.<br>
<br>The duke's apprenticeship in official duties came with the funeral of George V (1936), followed by the coronation of George VI, initially planned for Edward VIII. He rapidly demonstrated that he would stand no nonsense from anybody in ensuring the precise and punctual performance of majestic ceremonial. Later in 1937 he was appointed a knight of the Garter, at an unusually early age. His experience was put to good use in 1953 at the coronation of Elizabeth II, which the duke managed with magisterial authority and expertise. On this occasion he coped skilfully with the introduction into Westminster Abbey of television, to which he was initially opposed. His hereditary position also made him responsible for the College of Arms and its officers, in whom he took a consistent interest and with whose aid he regulated two other great state occasions, the (long prepared) funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965 and the investiture of the prince of Wales at Caernarfon in 1969, where the size of the budget and the weather both gave grounds for apprehension.<br>
<br>Norfolk was a lifelong devotee of the turf and made his mark both as an administrator and as an owner and breeder of horses. He became a member of the Jockey Club in 1933 and served as steward from 1966 to 1968; in addition he was vice-chairman of the Turf Board (1965&#150;8), where he took a traditionalist attitude to the problems of modern racing. Nothing gave him greater pleasure than his position as the queen's representative at Ascot (1945&#150;72); the victory of Ragstone, trained and bred at Arundel, in the Ascot gold cup of 1974 was a fine climax to his career. Another sporting enthusiasm was cricket. Not only did he welcome visiting teams with an opening game in the park at Arundel but he took a team to tour the West Indies in 1956&#150;7, playing occasionally himself; then in 1962&#150;3 he acted as manager of the English team to Australia, bringing his bluff common sense to bear on the problems of the tour. It was an unusual role for the senior duke of England.<br>
<br>In Sussex, Norfolk played his proper part. He was mayor of Arundel in 1935&#150;6 and lord lieutenant of the county from 1949 to 1974, as well as sitting on the county council. From 1941 to 1945 he served as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture in the coalition government, putting his robust knowledge of farming to the public good, but his heart was not in politics. In parallel with these official duties went his position as a spokesman for the Roman Catholic laity of England. As a chairman he was terse and efficient; in general his attitude was conservative and he did not welcome the alterations in language and ritual of the Second Vatican Council. In 1970 he participated in the canonization of the forty martyrs, who included his ancestor St Philip Howard (1557&#150;1595), and was received by Pope Paul VI. His local experience also led him to be a powerful and ardent advocate of the Territorial Army; in 1956&#150;9 he was chairman of the Territorial Army council.<br>
<br>The duke of Norfolk was happier in the countryside than in the metropolis; but his potent sense of duty drove him to undertake a broad variety of tasks, some hereditary, some of obligation, but also many of inclination. His often unmoving face concealed a considerable sense of humour and power of anecdote. In his old-fashioned way he was a grandee by birth, a countryman by inclination, and a good man who did his duty. He was appointed GCVO (1946), GBE (1968), and received the Royal Victorian Chain (1953). He died at Arundel Park House, which he had himself built in the grounds of Arundel Castle, on 31 January 1975. He was succeeded in the dukedom by his cousin, Miles Francis Stapleton Fitzalan-Howard, Baron Beaumont and Howard of Glossop (1915&#150;2002).<br>
<br>Norfolk's wife, <a name="cosubject_60378"></a><span class="headword">Lavinia Mary  Fitzalan-Howard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Strutt]</span></span>, duchess of Norfolk  (1916&#150;1995), <span class="occ">racehorse owner and breeder</span>, was born on 22 March 1916 at Kingston Hall, Nottingham, the only daughter of Algernon Henry Strutt, third Baron Belper (1883&#150;1956), and his first wife, Eva Isabel Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bruce (1892&#150;1987), the third daughter of Henry Campbell Bruce, second Baron Aberdare. In 1922 her parents divorced, and in 1924 her mother married (Albert Edward) Harry (Meyer Archibald) Primrose, Lord Dalmeny (1882&#150;1974), who in 1929 became sixth earl of Rosebery. He was a keen cricketer, racehorse owner, sometime steward of the Jockey Club, and master of the fashionable Whaddon Chase hunt. His stepdaughter (who was educated at Abbot's Hill, near Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire) rode his horses with the Whaddon Chase and in point-to-point races with her distinctive colours and, until the Disney Corporation intervened claiming copyright, a large Mickey Mouse on her jersey. Following her marriage to the duke of Norfolk she did not convert to Roman Catholicism, but their daughters were brought up as Catholics. She entered fully into the duke's public life and sporting interests, especially horse breeding and racing. At the coronation of 1937 she was one of the four duchesses who held the canopy over the queen at her annointing, and in 1953 she took the part of the queen in rehearsals at Westminster Abbey for the coronation. After her husband's death she continued to live at Arundel Park, and to breed and race horses with notable success: Moon Madness won the St Leger in 1986, and Sheriff's Star won the coronation cup at Epsom in 1989. The duchess was the first woman steward at Goodwood (1975&#150;95). From 1975 to 1990 she was lord lieutenant of West Sussex, the first woman lord lieutenant, and she had numerous local and charitable engagements: she estimated that she was involved with some 150 charities. In 1971 she was made a CBE and in 1990 the first non-royal lady companion of the Garter. According to one obituarist she was &#145;a formidable character: a true county lady of few words and all of them very much to the point&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 12 Dec 1995). She died at Arundel Park, Arundel, Sussex, on 10 December 1995, and was survived by her four daughters.<br>
