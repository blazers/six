<span class="headword">Malby, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1584), <span class="occ">soldier and president of Connacht</span>, was probably born in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His father died when Nicholas was four years old, and the boy was evidently reared, along with his brother John, in the family of a London merchant named John Malby, probably their father's brother, who had been admitted to fellowship at the Middle Temple in 1516&#150;17. It is not known whether Nicholas or his brother were themselves educated at Middle Temple. Nicholas Malby married Thomasine Lamb, whose father, Robert, was from Leeds and whose mother was a Castell from East Hatley in Cambridgeshire. Thomasine's maternal uncle, Thomas Castell, had studied law at the Middle Temple with the elder John Malby. They had a son, Henry, who matriculated at New College, Oxford, in June 1585, aged thirteen, and a daughter, Ursula. Henry married Elizabeth Jobson, granddaughter of Sir Francis Jobson, lieutenant of the Tower. Ursula married Anthony Brabazon, lieutenant-governor of Connacht. Thomasine Malby survived her first husband and subsequently married George Rawe.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerinIreland"></a>Early career in Ireland</h2>It is likely that Nicholas Malby's involvement in Ireland originated in the activities of his relative and guardian, John Malby, who was employed in supplying provisions for the army at Berwick, a point of departure for soldiers bound for Ireland. Nicholas Malby's presence in Ireland is first recorded in 1556, when he was among those Englishmen who were willing to take part in the proposed plantation of Queen's county. Six years later he was back in England when, on 6 August 1562, he and six others were found guilty of coining. The goldsmith involved was executed, but Malby was among those whose death sentence was commuted, probably through the intervention of Sir William Cecil. He was reprieved in September 1562 on condition that he serve under Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, in France. Both Warwick and Cecil were involved in procuring his pardon. By April 1563 he was acting as Warwick's secretary. He served in the army abroad for some years, being sent to Spain in 1565 where his conduct was commended by the English minister at Madrid.<br>
<br>On his return to England Malby was sent to Ireland to serve as a captain under the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney. Having gained extensive military experience abroad he was appointed a sergeant-major of the army in Ireland in 1567. After the death of Shane O'Neill at the hands of the MacDonalds in June 1567, Malby was stationed at Carrickfergus, co. Antrim, sharing the power of martial law with Captain William Piers and charged with keeping in check the Scots who threatened east Ulster. His successful handling of the threat posed by Sorley Boy MacDonald earned him praise from Sir Henry Sidney. In July 1569 he was sent to the assistance of Sir Peter Carew against the Butlers in Leinster. During a skirmish near Carlow he was severely injured in a fall from his horse.<br>
<br>Conscious of his responsibility to provide for his wife and young family, Malby went to London in spring 1571 to pursue his personal suits. He had equipped himself with letters of recommendation from Adam Loftus who considered him &#145;a right worthy and valiant captain&#146; who could not easily be spared from service in Ireland  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/31, no. 42), and Sir Edward Fitton who praised his long service and discreet diligence, but judged that Malby would make a &#145;coarse courtier and a worse suitor&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/31, no. 13). On 22 March 1571 he obtained a grant of the office of collector of the customs of the three east Ulster ports of Strangford, Ardglass, and Dundrum. On 5 October 1571 he received a further grant of MacCartan's country, the modern barony of Kinelarty in co. Down, on condition that he planted it with civil and loyal subjects before 22 March 1579. On his way back to Ireland in February 1572 the ship he commanded captured a Spanish ship in the channel.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1572 Malby received a commission to execute martial law in MacCartan's country but his involvement with the proposed plantation of the Ards, led first by Thomas Smith and subsequently by Walter Devereux, earl of Essex, was ultimately unsuccessful. Nevertheless his work in the Ards earned him the respect of the earl of Essex and of Edward Waterhouse, the latter describing him as a man of few words and an ill courtier, but of great reputation among soldiers. A plot by Brian mac Phelim O'Neill to kill Malby while at supper was foiled in November 1574. Malby was sent to London in December of that year to report to the privy council on the state of Ulster. He returned to Ireland on 5 May 1575 with special instructions for the earl of Essex, and with an order for his own admission to the Irish privy council. In the summer of 1575 he took part in Essex's expedition against Sorley Boy MacDonald.<h2>
<a name="Connachtanditspresidency"></a>Connacht and its presidency</h2>Recognizing that the Ards plantation was not going to succeed, Malby was again in London early in 1576 pursuing his claim to have land to the value of &pound;100 in fee farm in Ireland in exchange for surrendering his patent to MacCartan's country. From this point onward his attention shifted to Connacht and his subsequent land acquisitions were located in counties Roscommon and Longford. He pursued his interest in establishing an English colony in Roscommon in tandem with his role as provincial governor. In July 1576 Malby was chosen to replace Sir Edward Fitton as chief commissioner and military commander of Connacht. The office was perhaps higher than what someone of Malby's background could reasonably aspire to, but the privy council judged that &#145;his honesty and discretion will breed better government than would title or dignity&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/56, no. 15). His appointment was welcomed by Sir Henry Sidney as &#145;an apt instrument to frame the rude barbarous people of the province&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1574&#150;85</i>, 99). He accompanied the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, to Connacht in September 1576, and was knighted by him on 7 October. During his first winter in the province he succeeded in suppressing the rebellion of John and Ulick Burke, sons of the second earl of Clanricarde.<br>
<br>By the end of 1577, Malby considered that he had concluded his military tasks and was ready to attend to the civil government of Connacht. In particular he sought to implement a plan for taxation that would fund the provincial presidency. The first scheme for a composition of Connacht, devised by Sir Henry Sidney and implemented by Malby in 1577, laid the basis for the success of the English provincial administration in Connacht by making it self-financing. Malby's competence as an administrator and negotiator was clearly demonstrated by his successful implementation of this taxation scheme which did much to ensure the survival of the provincial presidency as an institution and Malby's own continuance in office.<br>
<br>Malby's military endeavours in Connacht were limited in scale. He intervened on behalf of O'Connor Sligo in a dispute with O'Donnell over Bundrowes Castle in October 1577, but was not successful. When his negotiations with Brian O'Rourke proved ineffective Malby used force against him in April 1578. In autumn 1578 he went to England, returning to Ireland in May 1579 with the title of president rather than chief commissioner of Connacht. The province of Connacht being largely peaceful, Malby was free to travel south with 600 troops to assist the lord justice, Sir William Drury, in suppressing James Fitzmaurice's uprising in Munster in the summer and autumn of 1579. After brief military expeditions to Burrishoole in co. Mayo and to O'Rourke's territory in Leitrim early in 1580, Malby was again free to play an active military role outside the province. He travelled to Dublin in summer 1580 to assist Lord Grey in suppressing the Baltinglass rising, and witnessed the defeat of the English forces at Glenmalure. O'Rourke took advantage of his absence from Connacht, and Malby, despite ill health, returned west to deal with the situation. Dissension among the Mayo Burkes threatened to escalate in February 1581 with the arrival of Scots mercenaries, but Malby had advance notice of their coming and prevented them reaching Mayo. He then negotiated a settlement between the rival contenders for the MacWilliam lordship in Mayo. Further unrest was caused in Connacht by the ongoing rivalry over succession to the Clanricarde lordship which was not resolved until after the deaths of the second earl and one of the rival contenders, John Burke, baron of Leitrim, in 1582.<h2>
<a name="ThecolonizationofRoscommon"></a>The colonization of Roscommon</h2>Malby was rewarded for his early successes in Connacht, receiving a twenty-one-year lease of the castle and lands of Roscommon along with extensive monastic lands in the same county, on 1 November 1577, at an annual rent of &pound;31 5<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. Following Malby's offer to build a walled town at Roscommon and at Athlone, he received a more generous grant from the queen. Athlone was reserved for the official use of the Connacht presidency, but in June 1579 Malby's lease of the lordship of Roscommon and its monastic land was changed to an outright grant of the lands to him and his male heirs. Parts of the castle at Roscommon were remodelled soon afterwards. Malby's son, Henry, was still a minor, and the grant stipulated that where the holder was a minor the chief governor of Connacht would place a guard in the castle of Roscommon at the owner's expense. In July 1579 Malby also received a grant of the annual composition rent of &pound;200 sterling payable by the O'Ferralls in the adjoining county of Longford, and was given power of distraint. He also obtained title to some monastic land in co. Longford. These arrangements allowed him a degree of control over the O'Ferralls, as well as providing an income, but Malby concentrated on his landed interests in co. Roscommon. The lands involved were extensive. He had effectively acquired title to the second largest estate in Connacht after the earl of Clanricarde. The monastic lands in particular were ripe for colonization, and Malby's strong presence in Roscommon attracted English settlers to the area. Some of the soldiers who had previously served with him in Ulster were among those who became his tenants there. His own brother John was also involved. Having learned valuable lessons from the failed Ards colony, Malby calculated that by using monastic lands as a base, and by treating the Irish courteously, an English colony could prosper under the protection of the presidency. Many of Malby's more significant tenants also served as officials of the Connacht presidency. The colony prospered in the 1580s and even after Malby's sudden death at Athlone on 4 March 1584, the English presence in Roscommon continued to expand. His successor as president, Sir Richard Bingham, was forced to pay rent for Roscommon Castle to his son, Henry Malby, when he wished to live there in the mid-1580s. The Malby colony suffered considerable setbacks during the nine years' war, and the death of Sir Nicholas's only son, Henry, in 1602 marked the end of the direct involvement of the Malby family in Roscommon. The descendants of other Elizabethan families who had established themselves in the area under the auspices of Sir Nicholas Malby lived on in the area for many generations.<h2>
<a name="Characterandassessment"></a>Character and assessment</h2>Malby was a self-made man who rose to prominence in Ireland by virtue of his considerable personal talent as a soldier and administrator. His success aroused jealousies, however, with the influential Thomas Butler, earl of Ormond, numbered among his antagonists. His strength lay in his ability to look after the interests of his soldiers while simultaneously dealing diplomatically with the Irish. He was a shrewd politician and diplomat whose strategic decisions were intelligent and well-informed. In his dealings with O'Rourke and O'Neill he &#145;had intelligence of all their doings, but dissembled his knowledge&#146;, as he explained to the earl of Leicester in 1583  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Carew Manuscripts, 1575&#150;88</span>, 362&#150;3). Malby understood the political concerns of the Irish and probably understood their language also. His obituary in the annals of the four masters recorded that:<blockquote>He was a man learned in the languages and tongues of the islands of the west of Europe, a brave and victorious man in battles fought through Ireland, Scotland, and France, in the service of his sovereign; and this was a lucrative service to him, for he received a suitable remuneration from the Queen, namely the constableship of the town of Athlone, and the governorship of the province of Connacht for seven years before his death, and a grant in perpetuity of the towns of Roscommon and Ballinasloe for himself and his heirs. (AFM, vol. 5, s.a. 1584)</blockquote>There was more ambivalence in the comment of the Irish obituarists in the annals of Loch C&eacute; who noted of him that:<blockquote>there came not to Ireland in his own time, nor often before, a better gentleman of the foreigners than he, and he placed all Connacht under bondage. And it is not possible to count or reckon all that this man destroyed throughout Ireland, and he executed many works, especially on the courts of the towns of Athlone and Roscommon. (<span class="italic">Annals of Loch C&eacute;</span>, vol. 2, s.a. 1584)</blockquote>
