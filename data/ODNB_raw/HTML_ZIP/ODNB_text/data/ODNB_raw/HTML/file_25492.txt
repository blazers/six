<span class="headword">Shuttleworth,  Philip Nicholas</span>  (1782&#150;1842), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born at Kirkham, Lancashire, on 9 February 1782, the second son of Humphrey Shuttleworth (1734/5&#150;1812), vicar of Kirkham from 1771 to 1812, and of Preston, Lancashire, from 1784 to 1809, who wrote some tracts against the papal pretensions. His mother was Anne, only child of Philip Hoghton. Philip was educated at Preston grammar school, and in 1796 entered Winchester College, where Dr Goddard nominated him to a scholarship. He was elected a scholar of New College, Oxford, in 1800, and graduated BA in 1806, MA in 1811, and BD and DD in 1822. In 1803 he won the chancellor's Latin verse prize, the subject being Byzantium. Soon after graduating he became tutor to the Hon. Algernon Herbert, and at a subsequent date to Lord Holland's son, Charles Richard Fox, later a general and distinguished numismatist. He was admitted to the Holland circle, and visited the continent with Lord and Lady Holland in 1814 and 1815. Shuttleworth was tutor and fellow of New College until 1822, and proctor of the university in 1820.<br>
<br>In October 1822 Shuttleworth was unanimously chosen warden of New College, an academic position which enabled him to marry on 29 July 1823 Emma Martha, daughter of George Welch of High Leck, Tunstall, Lancashire. The eldest of their children was the translator and poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47622/', "(Emma) Frances Bevan")</script>. On 19 November 1824 Lord Holland presented him to the rectory of Foxley, Wiltshire. As a strong whig, Shuttleworth's election was welcomed by Samuel Parr as &#145;a triumph of learning over pedantry and of constitutional principles over sacerdotal intolerance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Samuel Parr</span>, 8.223). He supported Catholic emancipation and, as a member of the university's hebdomadal board, proposed in 1834 a relaxation of the religious tests which excluded dissenters. In 1836 he defended R. D. Hampden, the heterodox divinity professor. An effective preacher from the university pulpit, he published two volumes entitled <span class="italic">Sermons on some of the Leading Principles of Christianity</span> (1827&#150;34). A textbook, <span class="italic">A Paraphrastic Translation of the Apostolic Epistles</span> (1829), reached a fifth edition in 1854. His <span class="italic">The Consistency of the Whole Scheme of Revelation with itself, and with Human Reason</span> (1832) was recommended to students as a supplement to their reading of Bishop Butler. His churchmanship was orthodox, though his attack on the Tractarians, who regarded him with particular aversion, in a sermon <span class="italic">Not Tradition but Scripture</span> (1838), was admired by evangelicals. In his own college he attempted reforms, notably presiding over the surrender of the ancient privilege by which New College men were exempt from university examinations. The deviser of a railway to speed the circulation of port in the senior common room, he was a noted wit, whose ambitions for ecclesiastical promotion were predicted in his schoolboy verse &#145;Make me, O Sphere-descended Queen, A Bishop, or, at least, a Dean&#146;  (Tuckwell, 169).<br>
<br>Shuttleworth's trimming tendencies delayed his advancement. &#145;His conscientiousness, tho' sincere, has the gait of indecision and his conciliation and ingenuity assume the appearance, and perhaps in some degree the reality, of timidity and compromise&#146;, Lord Holland noted  (<span class="italic">The Holland House Diaries</span>, 1977, 344). He gave offence to his whig patrons by signing an address early in 1835 urging Peel to remain in office, Melbourne subsequently passing him over for vacant mitres (notably Salisbury in 1837) and only with reluctance promoting him to the see of Chichester in September 1840. His most significant act as bishop was ironically to appoint, in disregard of his wife's opposition, the &#145;Puseyite&#146; Henry Manning to an archdeaconry.<br>
<br>Shuttleworth died at the episcopal palace, Chichester, on 7 January 1842. Pusey saw in the sudden removal of this inveterate opponent of Tractarianism a token of God's presence within the Church of England  (H. P. Liddon, <span class="italic">Life of Edward Bouverie Pusey</span>, 2, 1893, 294). Shuttleworth was survived by his widow, a son (who died in 1848), and three daughters. His occasional verse was published after his death in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (3rd ser., 11, 1861, 245, 542) and in the <span class="italic">Life of William Buckland</span> (1894). His &#145;Specimen of a geological lecture&#146; was included in C. G. B. Daubeny's collection of <span class="italic">Fugitive Poems Connected with Natural History and Physical Science</span> (1869).<br>
