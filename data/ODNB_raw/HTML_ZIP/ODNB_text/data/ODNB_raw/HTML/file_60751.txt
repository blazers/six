<span class="headword">Cuneo,  Terence Tenison</span>  (1907&#150;1996), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 1 November 1907 at 215 Uxbridge Road, Hammersmith, London, the only child of Cyrus Cincinato Cuneo (<i>d</i>. 1916/17), artist, and his wife, Nellie Marion (Nell), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tenison, also an artist and a relative of the poet Tennyson. His father was born in the United States, of Italian descent, and was related to Garibaldi; he studied under Whistler and was a successful magazine illustrator in London until his death, from blood poisoning, when Terence Cuneo was nine.<br>
<br>Cuneo was educated at St Michael's College, Dawlish, and at Sutton Valence School, Kent. He then studied at Chelsea Polytechnic and the Slade School of Fine Art before following in his father's footsteps as a commercial illustrator, working for magazines such as the <span class="italic">Boy's Own Paper</span>, <span class="italic">The Magnet</span>, and the <span class="italic">Christian Herald</span>. In 1931 he joined the London Sketch Club, at one of whose meetings he met his future wife, Catherine Mayfield Monro (1908/9&#150;1979), younger daughter of Edwin George Monro, army major and company director. They married on 28 September 1934 and had two daughters, Linda (<i>b</i>. 1937) and Carole (<i>b</i>. 1941).<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Cuneo was war artist for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> in France in 1940, served briefly with the Royal Engineers, portraying underground activities in occupied Europe (the subject of a one-man exhibition) in 1941, and then served as an official war artist, producing propaganda paintings for the Ministry of Information, the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office, and the War Artists' Advisory Committee. He also illustrated the book <span class="italic">How to Draw Tanks</span>.<br>
<br>After the war the publicity manager of the London and North Eastern Railway commissioned Cuneo's first poster design, <span class="italic">Giants Refreshed</span>, showing locomotives in Doncaster railway works. This was the beginning of a railway poster career that lasted for the next half century. Cuneo designed the set of stamps commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Great Western Railway in 1985, and had a train named after him in 1990. His largest painting (20 ft &times; 10 ft), commissioned by the Science Museum in 1967, was of the concourse of Waterloo Station.<br>
<br>Cuneo was official artist at Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, and his painting, <span class="italic">The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey</span>, was presented to the queen by her lords lieutenant in 1955. His paintings covering numerous other state and royal functions range from <span class="italic">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at the Middle Temple Banquet</span> (1950) to <span class="italic">The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Banquet, Guildhall</span> (1969). Cuneo was a renowned portrait painter also. Among his subjects were Edward Heath (1971), Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein (1972), King Hussein of Jordan (1980), and Colonel H. Jones VC (1984). He painted the queen on numerous occasions; his portraits <span class="italic">H. M. the Queen as Colonel-in-Chief, Grenadier Guards</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">H. M. the Queen as Patron of the Kennel Club</span> (1975) were particularly admired. He held one-man exhibitions at RWS Galleries, London, in 1954 and 1958, at the Sladmore Gallery, London, in 1971, 1972, and 1974, and at the Mall Galleries, London, in 1988. He was appointed OBE in 1987 and CVO in 1994, and was president of the Industrial Painters Group and the Society of Equestrian Artists.<br>
<br>Cuneo &#145;was immensely conservative as an artist, to a point that would make Sir Alfred Munnings look like some mad revolutionary tearaway&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>); nevertheless his works were enduringly popular. He was renowned for putting a mouse in his paintings; this first appeared in 1953 and subsequently in most of his paintings. His autobiography was entitled <span class="italic">The Mouse and his Master</span> (1977). He was an insatiable traveller and had a mischievous sense of humour. He painted almost until his death; his last, unfinished, painting was of the channel tunnel. He died, a millionaire, at Arbrook House, Copsem Lane, Esher, Surrey, on 3 January 1996, of bronchopneumonia and heart failure, and was cremated in Leatherhead on 17 January. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 17 April. He was survived by his daughter Carole, his wife, Catherine, and daughter Linda having predeceased him. A retrospective exhibition of his railway art was held at the National Railway Museum in York in January 1997.<br>
