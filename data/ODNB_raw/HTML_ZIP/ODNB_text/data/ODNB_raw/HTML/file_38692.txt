<span class="headword">Garvice,  Charles Andrew</span>  (1850&#150;1920), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Limehouse, London, on 24 August 1850, the son of Andrew John Garvice (1816&#150;1851), bricklayer, and his wife, Mira, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Winter (1819&#150;1870). He was baptized on 18 September 1850 at St Dunstan and All Saints' Church in Stepney, London. Fatherless from infancy, at the age of twenty he was living with his maternal uncle following his mother's death, and was working as a bookseller. Obscurity otherwise envelops the formative phase in the career of an author who became a publishing phenomenon&#151;&#145;the most successful novelist in England&#146;, according to Arnold Bennett in 1910. There is no record of his marriage, although he had married by 1873, when he dedicated his d&eacute;but publication, <span class="italic">Eve: and other Verses</span>, to his wife; they had two sons and five daughters. Possibly, Garvice had married abroad, as in the preface to <span class="italic">Eve</span> he says that he &#145;scribbled on foreign steam-boats and in railway carriages&#146;. He also alludes to a struggling existence, including, perhaps, a bereavement: &#145;Most of them [the verses] were written at midnight when the hand was too weary to write and the brain to forge stronger work; some few were born under the cloud of a heavy sorrow.&#146;.<br>
<br>From <span class="italic">Eve</span> and his first published novel, <span class="italic">Maurice Durant</span> (1875), it may be surmised that Garvice had lived in Italy, perhaps also in the American West, although the circumstantial detail is not such as to make this supposition completely convincing; and among later Garvice stories were also Australian bushranger tales. <span class="italic">Maurice Durant</span> was dedicated to the actor Henry Irving, &#145;with the warmest admiration and esteem&#146;; and it contained a preface addressed from The Retreat, Cookham, in Berkshire. The text and chapter epigraphs indicate something of Garvice's education: an acquaintance at least with Greek, Roman, and English classical literature. A hero of the story is Chudleigh Chichester, a baronet's son; and this unusual forename was given by the author to a son of his own who was born on 12 January 1875 and who joined the Royal Dublin Fusiliers in 1896. Chudleigh Garvice was made DSO in the South African War; afterwards, in Egypt, he rose to major and was commandant of police at Alexandria when he died on 23 March 1921. <span class="italic">Maurice Durant</span> is revealing too about Charles Garvice's politics, which may be captioned as tory democrat. A centrepiece of the story involves a parliamentary election in which Chudleigh Chichester is victorious on account of his &#145;outspoken determination to uphold the British throne and constitution&#146; and to act as &#145;the working man's friend by voting for the reduction of taxes and the labour time&#146;. His opponents are a self-made Manchester millionaire who cheerfully advocates &#145;rampant liberalism&#146;, and an alternative &#145;labourers' friend&#146; who has large red hands and &#145;greasy shock head&#146;, spouts revolutionary balderdash, and organizes roughs to break up Chudleigh's meetings. This was an immature story, but the politics stuck. Later Garvice would serve as Conservative county councillor for the Northam district of north Devon; he joined the Primrose League and Freemasons; and a socially conservative philosophy formed the bedrock of all his tales&#151;that there was nothing really wrong with the world that could not be fixed by good hearts beating in honest men and virtuous women.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Maurice Durant</span> was published first in periodical serialization, where it had a fair amount of success. The book version did not, and Garvice explained its failure in marketing, not literary, terms: it was overlong and overpriced for popular sales. Astuteness as a businessman of letters would become Garvice's trademark, and for the next twenty years he published no more books, only stories for fiction magazines on both sides of the Atlantic. He was editor as well as chief contributor for one of the periodicals of the American publisher George Monro, which sold for 7<i>d</i>. in England. Garvice was sufficiently well paid to buy Moorlands, a dairy farm at Little Silworthy in north Devon, about which he wrote in <span class="italic">A Farm in Creamland</span> (1911). He began to farm directly in 1903, though he had owned the property earlier; more extraordinarily, he became president of the Farmers' and Landowners' Association, though he described himself still as an amateur farmer. It was at a debating society at neighbouring Bideford that Garvice discovered his talent for public speaking. In those pre-broadcasting days, lecturing was a remunerative sideline for an author. A favourite on the circuit, Garvice became president of the Institute of Lecturers.<br>
<br>Garvice's literary career had been relaunched at the end of the 1890s, when the stranglehold over publishing practices exerted by Mudie's and Smith's circulating libraries had been broken, and the format for new novels was the single volume, price 6<i>s</i>., rather than the three-decker selling for a guinea and a half. There was not one but several reading publics, however; Garvice's embraced those possessed of pennies rather than shillings: the mass reading public, comprising people educated to elementary level following the 1870 act. It was the sixpenny paper-covered Garvice, not the 6<i>s</i>. hard-backed Garvice, which emerged &#145;as numerous in the shops and on the railway bookstalls as the leaves of Vallombrosa&#146;. This description was by Eveleigh Nash, whose literary agency included Garvice among its first clients and negotiated the simultaneous publication of four of his novels, <span class="italic">Nance</span>, <span class="italic">A Coronet of Shame</span>, <span class="italic">Her Heart's Desire</span>, and <span class="italic">The Outcast of the Family</span>, in 1900. Nash and, after him, the literary agency of A. P. Watt, deserve some credit for accelerating the Garvice vogue, but the original discovery was made in America, where <span class="italic">Just a Girl</span> (1898) had sold 100,000 copies. The publicity it received there attracted reviewers in England, who assured readers that here was a born story writer of thrilling romances and pulsating adventures which were healthy in tone. This last was important for a church- and chapel-going audience who still retained suspicions that novel reading was sinful; and it was notable that Garvice's novels were strongly commended by Robertson Nicoll in the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span> and by other religious periodicals&#151;the <span class="italic">Methodist Times</span>, <span class="italic">The Baptist</span>, the <span class="italic">Christian World</span>, and <span class="italic">Church Family Magazine</span>&#151;as well as by the national and provincial dailies and the decidedly secular <span class="italic">Sportsman</span> and <span class="italic">Referee</span>. &#145;Round a large kiosk at a popular seaside place&#146;, observed <span class="italic">T. P.'s Weekly</span> in 1911, &#145;Garvice's love stories fairly dominated its shelves. A dozen of them at least were displayed in the best places, and in provident quantity&#146;.<br>
<br>Between 1900 and 1920 over fifty novels flowed from Garvice's pen&#151;more correctly, from his secretary's typewriter because, thorough professional that he was, he took to dictating his work, pipe smoking all the while. These tales were not all the product of a fifty- and sixty-year-old imagination, but recycled from his long apprenticeship of writing <i>feuilleton</i>. Garvice originally sold his stories outright but, as his wealth increased, &#145;I got them back by the simple expedient of buying the periodical, lock, stock and barrel in which they appeared; and I am glad to be able to state that I hold now the copyright of everything I have written&#146;, he told Douglas Sladen in 1913. Sladen, the first editor (1897&#150;9) of <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, was a friend and neighbour of Garvice who, in his prime, resided at 4 Maids of Honour Row, by the palace at Richmond, as well as keeping the Thatch Cottage, Hambledon, near Henley-on-Thames. Garvice had, Sladen recorded in 1914, &#145;the largest sales of any one in the world. I have seen the figures. Last year's sales alone amounted to 1,750,000 copies&#151;books of all prices&#146;  (Sladen). The <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>'s estimate in 1911 was that his readership was 6 million; nor did the First World War slow his popularity, and the final computation must result in a staggering sum.<br>
<br>Riding, fishing, and cycling were among the recreations Garvice listed in 1905; and the first two persisted, the cycling being overtaken by motoring with advancing age and riches. Garvice was clubbable, a member of the Garrick, Whitefriars, and Authors', indeed chairman of the last, whose fortunes he restored after 1908 when it had appeared doomed to closure. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, although intellectual types joked that he &#145;did not strain himself to write Literature; he just lured away Ford Madox Ford's secretary, for he felt sure that, working so much with Ford, she must have caught it from him&#146;  (Jepson). Garvice was not dim or humourless&#151;<span class="italic">The Scribblers' Club</span> (1909) is a clever set of droll short stories about the literary world&#151;but he was unpretentious. He saw nothing wrong in brightening the lives of millions of readers with a string of unsophisticated romances, which careered along pell-mell and tumbled over all sorts of obstacles before reaching that always satisfying terminus where villainy is defeated and virtue rewarded. Garvice joined sympathy to vitality. He was the &#145;kindest, most self-effacing&#146; man, thought Baroness Orczy, who served with him in 1914&#150;15 on a committee of the Society of Authors which dispensed relief to impoverished colleagues. Garvice's own fortune was vast: his will, made in 1917 and proved at &pound;71,049 6<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., mentioned his wife, Elizabeth (1852/3&#150;1937), and indicated that he had already made extensive provision for his surviving children. Garvice died on 1 March 1920 at his home in Richmond, from cerebral haemorrhage, after lying in a coma for eight days.<br>
