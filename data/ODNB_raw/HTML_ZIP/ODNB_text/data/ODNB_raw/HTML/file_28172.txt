<span class="headword">Veitch,  James</span>, Lord Elliock  (1712&#150;1793), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 25 September 1712, the eldest son of William Veitch (<i>d</i>. 1747) of Boigend and Elliock in Dumfriesshire, and his wife, Christian Thomson, daughter of a provost of Peebles. Educated at Edinburgh University and at Leiden University (which he entered in 1733), and perhaps also at Halle, Veitch began his legal career as an apprentice to his father, an eminent writer to the signet. He was called to the bar on 15 February 1738. Shortly afterwards he went abroad to continue his studies in Holland and Germany, where his &#145;abilities and conversation&#146; attracted the attention of Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia (from 1740 Frederick II, &#145;the Great&#146;), who persuaded him to cut short his grand tour and remain at his court for some years.<br>
<br>Veitch was a sociable character with an attractive personality, sharp mind, and wide range of interests. On his return to Scotland he became a popular member of Edinburgh legal and literati circles. He also kept up a correspondence with Frederick. On 13 July 1747 he was appointed sheriff-depute of the county of Peebles, one of the first wave of legally qualified and salaried sheriffs-depute appointed following the <span class="roman">Heritable Jurisdictions Act</span> of 1747.<br>
<br>Politically Veitch had connections with Charles Douglas, third duke of Queensberry, who in 1755 brought him in as member for Dumfriesshire, a constituency dominated by the Queensberry family. At Westminster, Veitch appears to have taken a fairly independent line. Despite the approaches of Newcastle, he voted against Newcastle and Fox over the Minorca enquiry in 1757. A member of the committee to prepare the <span class="roman">Scottish Militia Bill</span> of 1760, he objected to Pitt's proposal to &#145;draw the Highland line&#146; and seems to have abstained in the vote on the bill on 15 April.<br>
<br>Later that year Newcastle, anxious to secure a parliamentary seat for Thomas Miller, the new lord advocate, advised Miller to propose to Queensberry that if Veitch were promoted to the bench on the first vacancy, Queensberry might bring in Miller in his place. Queensberry agreed to the proposal. On 22 October 1760 Andrew Macdowall, Lord Bankton, died. A month later, on 22 November, Miller, &#145;from long and intimate acquaintance&#146;, recommended Veitch to Hardwicke for the vacancy:<blockquote>He is a man of great worth and as much in the favour and esteem of his country as any man I know, and though he has not had much practice at the bar yet he is a man of learning and solid knowledge of the law and I observe that the prospect of his promotion gives very general satisfaction both to the judges and to the bar. (BL, Add. MS 35449, fol. 284)</blockquote>Veitch duly resigned in February 1761 and took his seat on the bench on 6 March with the title of Lord Elliock. He was a well-respected judge, with a scholarly bent. He was appointed a commissioner for the forfeited estates in 1767, a deputy governor of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1776, and a commissioner for fisheries and manufactures the following year. He died at his home in St Andrew's Square, Edinburgh, on 1 July 1793. He was unmarried and his estates were inherited by his nephew.<br>
