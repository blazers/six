<span class="headword">Hobbes,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1538), <span class="occ">abbot of Woburn</span>, is of unknown origins, and nothing can be said of his life before he became abbot of the Cistercian abbey of Woburn in 1524. On 27 January 1530 he obtained a royal licence for the abbey to hold two annual fairs in the town, and on 5 April 1532 he was one of the &#145;general reformers&#146; commissioned by the king to hold a visitation of the whole Cistercian order; in that capacity he was present at the investigation into the misconduct of John Chascombe, abbot of Bruern, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>In 1534 Hobbes acknowledged the royal supremacy and persuaded the more reluctant members of his abbey to do likewise. Soon, however, influenced by the martyrdom of the London Carthusians and by the suppression of the lesser monasteries in 1536, Hobbes significantly altered his position, declaring in January 1538 that &#145;The Bysshop of Rome's Auctorite is good and lawful within this Realme accordyng to the old trade, and that is the true waye. And the contrary of the kynges parte but usurpacion disceyved by flattery and adulacion&#146;  (Scott Thompson, 137). He may also have been encouraged by the appointment of James Prestwich, a staunch conservative in religion, to be schoolmaster to the small group of royal wards then boarding in the abbey. Although several monks sympathized with Hobbes's stance, notably the sub-prior, Ralph Barnes, and the sexton, Laurence Blunham, others were opposed to his views, and in the spring of 1538 he was reported to Cromwell by William Sherburne, curate of the parish chapel and a former friar with whom Hobbes had had various disagreements. Cromwell acted quickly, dispatching William Petre and John Williams in May to take depositions, and on 14 June Hobbes, the sub-prior, and the sexton were tried at Woburn. Barnes and Blunham recanted but it appears that Hobbes held firm, although in some places it is difficult to establish an exact meaning from the long and rambling depositions of a man physically ill from strangury, and to disentangle apologies for bluntness of speech from repentance on points of principle. It is certain, however, that to the very end he remained opposed to the suppression of the monasteries, the distribution of &#145;wretched heretic books&#146; by Cromwell, and the royal divorce, all sufficient to make his conviction a formality. Indeed, he confessed his offences and offered no defence. Along with his two colleagues Hobbes was shortly afterwards hanged, drawn, and quartered and the abbey confiscated by attainder. According to local tradition an oak tree in the abbey grounds served as the gallows.<br>
<br>Despite the account by John Stow and the much later versions by James Froude and Francis Gasquet of the events leading to his execution, it is clear that Hobbes was no political radical and took no part in the northern rising of 1536, as Stow mistakenly believed. On the contrary he was simply a conservative in religion and an able administrator of his abbey (it is significant that no charge of mismanagement or misconduct was brought against him) who opposed the destruction of the monasteries.<br>
