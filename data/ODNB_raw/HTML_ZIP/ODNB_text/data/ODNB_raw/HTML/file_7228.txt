<span class="headword">Davies <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cavenaugh]</span>,  Christian <span class="st"> [Catherine; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>alias </em>Christopher or Richard Welsh; <em>called </em>Mother Ross]</span>  (1667&#150;1739), <span class="occ">female soldier</span>, was, according to <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Mrs. Christian Davies</span> (1740), born Christian Cavenaugh in Dublin. She was raised by her parents on a farm at Leixlip, co. Kildare until, seduced by a cousin at the age of seventeen, she moved to Dublin to live with an aunt. Her father, a brewer and maltster, died in the service of the Jacobite cause in 1691, whereupon the family property was seized. Inheriting a Dublin public house upon the death of her aunt, she managed the business for several years, marrying Richard Welsh, an employee, about 1688 and giving birth to two sons. Her husband disappeared in 1692 and, in a letter she received a year later, revealed that he was in the army in Flanders.<br>
<br>After arranging settlement of her business and children, Welsh began the search for her husband, enlisting as a foot soldier under the name of Christopher Welsh. Wounded before the battle of Landen in 1693, she recovered and was taken prisoner and then exchanged in 1694. Passing the winter of 1694&#150;5 with her regiment in Gorkhum, she courted a burgher's daughter for whom she fought a duel. Bidding farewell to the girl under pretence of seeking a commission, she enlisted as a dragoon under Lord John Hay, fighting until the treaty of Ryswick ended hostilities in 1697, when she returned to Dublin, maintaining her disguise as Richard Welsh.<br>
<br>With the renewal of war in 1701 Welsh re-enlisted and, according to the <span class="italic">Life</span>, fought in most of the battles of Marlborough's campaign, evading discovery of her masquerade even when she was wounded. Following the battle of Blenheim in 1704, she recognized her husband faithlessly courting a Dutch woman, chastised and then forgave him, and arranged with him to serve together (in celibacy), passing as brothers. Wounded at the battle of Ramillies, Welsh was discovered to be a woman by the surgeons and was reported to her officers, who responded with surprise and commendation. Christian and Richard Welsh then wed a second time in the camp, and she continued in the campaign as his acknowledged wife, serving as a sutler foraging for the troops. With the death of Richard Welsh at the battle of Malplaquet (1709), Christian's lamentations earned her the sobriquet Mother Ross from one Captain Ross, a sympathetic bystander. Several months later she married a grenadier named Hugh Jones who was soon killed at the siege of St Venant (1710). In 1712 Christian returned to England where, commended by the duke of Argyll, she was presented to the queen who awarded her, as pension, a shilling a day for life. Having returned to Dublin and been unable to claim the property she had settled in the 1690s, Jones set up a pub and pie house, married another soldier, named Davies, followed him to England, and eventually used her influence to have her husband admitted as a pensioner in the Royal Hospital at Chelsea, where she lived with him until she died of a fever on 7 July 1739. According to the <span class="italic">Life and Adventures</span> she was buried in Chelsea College burial-ground.<br>
<br>Brief accounts of her life, such as that in <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> (July 1739), appeared at the time of Christian's death. In 1740 a first-person account, <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Mrs. Christian Davies</span>, was published in London, purportedly &#145;taken from her own Mouth&#146;. This narrative appeared in several editions, including a third-person abridgement of 1742 ascribed to &#145;J. Wilson, formerly a Surgeon in the Army&#146;. A biographical &#145;history&#146; in the picaresque mode, the <span class="italic">Life and Adventures</span> clearly mixes, in an ultimately undeterminable ratio, elements of fact with legends and motifs conventional in early modern popular ballads and prose narratives about masquerading heroines. Often cited, paraphrased, and reprinted, the <span class="italic">Life and Adventures</span> was mistakenly included among the works of Daniel Defoe until the twentieth century. A separate strand of traditions about Davies surfaces in histories of Chelsea and the military facilities there. From a &#145;list of old admissions into Chelsea Hospital&#146;, G. R. Gleig quotes in 1838: &#145;19th Nov.1717. Stair's Dragoons: Catherine Welch, a fatt jolly-breast woman, received several wounds in the service, in the habit of a man;&#151;from the 19th July 1717&#146;  (Gleig, 2.227). In some fifty pages of &#145;A tradition of King William's wars&#146; Gleig then recounts the &#145;life&#146; of &#145;Catherine Cavenaugh, otherwise Catherine Welch, otherwise Catherine Davies, otherwise Mother Ross&#146;  (ibid., 228) in a narrative which parallels the popular 1740 account but includes as well a number of episodes not found in it.<br>
<br>The legendary Christian (or Catherine) Davies poses a challenge to the biographer. A remarkable person who did exist, Davies supplies a glimpse of the lower social ranks which remain largely invisible to history. But events of her picaresque &#145;life&#146; as variously recounted are controvertible and contradictory. Documentation in a patronymic culture is difficult to trace for any multiply married woman, especially a woman of the underclasses. In addition, the masquerading Davies specialized in fabrication in her actions and undoubtedly in her reporting of those actions. Furthermore, her &#145;life and adventures&#146; took on larger cultural significance as a legend which contributed to established narratives of early modern cross-gender masquerade. Stories of Davies's soldiering thus predictably conform more to the preoccupation with cross-dressing women in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European popular songs and prose accounts than to heretofore identified records of military history. Her masquerading experiences were wrought into widely known stories which, however apocryphal, accrued imaginative force and cultural meaning for several generations of readers.<br>
