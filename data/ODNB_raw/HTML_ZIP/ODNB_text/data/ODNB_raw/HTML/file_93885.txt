<span class="headword">Dalton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kuipers]</span>,  Katharina Dorothea <span class="st"> [Kittie]</span></span>  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">chiropodist and physician</span>, was born at Delaporte Gardens, Muswell Hill, London, on 12 November 1916, the second of five children of Johannes Kuipers, provision merchant, and his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knoester. Her parents were Dutch &eacute;migr&eacute;s. She was still young when her father died but, as he had been a freemason, she was educated at the Royal Masonic School in London. Her childhood ambition was to become a doctor but she won a scholarship to the London Foot Hospital in the early 1930s and trained as a chiropodist. She practised chiropody for over a decade, during which time she published her first book, <span class="italic">Essentials of Chiropody for Students</span>, in 1938 (the last and sixth edition of this book was published in 1968). She married Wilfred Thompson in 1939 but three years later he was killed in action while serving in the RAF during the Second World War. Despite being a war widow with a young son she was determined to fulfil her childhood ambition and was accepted to study medicine at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1943. A year later she married Thomas Ernest (Tom) Dalton, with whom she subsequently had three more children&#151;one son and two daughters. After five years of medical study she qualified on 7 July 1948, the day the National Health Service started. She then became a trainee general practitioner in north London.<br>
<br>In her first month of practising Dalton was called out to a patient with a severe asthmatic attack. The patient's husband informed her that the same thing happened each month. Linking this with her own experience of monthly migraines that disappeared when she was pregnant, she became interested in the menstrual cycle and started to chart the patients who visited her surgery at regular times each month. Thus began her research interests that paralleled her career as a GP. Following discussions and advice from a former teacher and endocrinologist, Raymond Greene (Graham Greene's brother), she began to treat some of her patients who complained of cyclical physical and psychological symptoms with natural progesterone. This work led to the first publication by Dalton and Greene on the premenstrual syndrome, which appeared in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> in 1953. Although premenstrual tension had first been described by Robert Frank in 1931, Dalton realized that there were both physical and psychological symptoms associated with the approach of menstruation and thus coined the term &#145;premenstrual syndrome&#146; (PMS). In 1957 she opened the first PMS clinic at University College Hospital in London, which she ran and directed for over thirty years. Her first book on women's health, <span class="italic">Premenstrual Syndrome</span>, was published in 1964, the same year that she took rooms in Wimpole Street seeing private patients. During her career she spent more and more time there, eventually giving up her NHS position as a GP.<br>
<br>Dalton's research on PMS also took her to Holloway prison, a women's prison in London, where she interviewed newly committed prisoners and found that 49 per cent had been sentenced for crimes committed in the four days prior to or during menstruation. As a consequence of her research she was often approached by lawyers defending women accused of crimes such as murder, arson, and theft. Often her evidence was part of a successful defence taking into consideration that crimes were committed during the premenstrual period and thus at a time of diminished responsibility. An expert witness in about fifty trials, she refused to act on behalf of defendants unless they showed cyclical repetitive symptoms that responded to treatment.<br>
<br>Dalton's innovative work in defining PMS and her view on its treatment with natural progesterone and a diet to maintain blood-sugar levels were not universally accepted by the medical profession. Her studies were criticized for not being properly controlled, and her research remained controversial for decades despite the fact that she convinced many doctors that PMS was a real disorder. She later turned her attention to depression after childbirth and again she advocated that natural progesterone (not the synthestic progestagen used in oral contraceptives) could alleviate symptoms. With her son Michael she also studied the toxicity of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, which was then being used by some doctors to treat PMS. Their study was used as part of the basis on which in 1997 the UK Committee on Toxicity restricted the sale of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> to doses of 1 mg or less per day.<br>
<br>During her career Dalton produced more than a hundred articles and research papers on PMS, post-natal depression, the importance of maintaining blood sugar levels, migraine, and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> toxicity. She also wrote eight popular books on women's health including <span class="italic">The Menstrual Cycle</span> (1969), <span class="italic">The Premenstrual Syndrome and Progesterone Therapy</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Once a Month</span> (1978), <span class="italic">Depression after Childbirth</span> (1980), <span class="italic">PMS</span> (1994), and <span class="italic">The PMS Bible</span> (2000). Her books were translated into seventeen different languages and some stayed in print for over twenty years.<br>
<br>In 1970 Dalton served as the first female president of the general practioners' section of the Royal College of Medicine, and in 1982 she was made a fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners, of which she had been a founder member. In 1983 she helped to establish the National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome (NAPS). In her later years she suffered from severe arthritis but still worked and drove her buggy round Harley Street until she retired at the age of eighty-four in 2000, eight years after the death of her second husband, Tom Dalton. She moved to Hereford and then Poole, Dorset.<br>
<br>Described as outspoken, warm, and motherly, with an infectious sense of fun, Dalton worked very much on her own. She retained her belief in the therapeutic effects of natural progesterone despite medical doubts and lack of vigorous clinical evidence regarding its efficacy. Her contributions to women's health, however, were significant, and many felt that her achievements were never really recognized or acknowledged during her lifetime. Whether or not her dogged belief in natural progesterone stood up to clinical scrutiny, she did define PMS and brought many aspects of women's health into the public domain. She died at Canford Chase Nursing Home, 40 Western Road, Branksome Park, Poole, Dorset, on 17 September 2004, of atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism. She was survived by her four children, two of whom were doctors.<br>
