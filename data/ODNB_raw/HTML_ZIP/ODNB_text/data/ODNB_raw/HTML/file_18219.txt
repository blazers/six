<span class="headword">Martin,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Peter Parley]</span>  (1801&#150;1867), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born at Woodbridge, Suffolk, the son of Jane Martin, an unmarried laundress who worked for officers of the garrison stationed at Woodbridge during the Napoleonic wars. Reputedly, his father was Sir Benjamin Blomfield. After attending a dame-school at Woodbridge, in 1815 he became an assistant to Thomas Howe, a woollen draper at Battersea, Surrey. Howe's wife was a close friend of Elizabeth Fry, the Quaker social reformer, and under the guidance of these two women Martin improved his education sufficiently to obtain the post of master in a school at Uxbridge. He remained there until 1836, when he returned to Woodbridge and earned his living by delivering lectures and writing.<br>
<br>After beginning by producing articles for magazines, Martin began to undertake more substantial books for purchase by schools and parents. He wrote <span class="italic">The Christian Philosopher</span> (1832), <span class="italic">Every Boy's Arithmetic</span> (1833), with J. T. Crossley, edited the <span class="italic">Educational Magazine</span> (1835), which was &#145;short-lived and uninteresting&#146;  (Darton, 223), <span class="italic">The Parlour Book, or, Familiar Conversations, on Science and the Arts</span> (1835?), <span class="italic">The Book of Sports, Athletic Exercises, and Amusements</span> (1837?), and <span class="italic">The Moral and Intellectual School Book</span> (1838). He more famously took on the pseudonym used by Samuel Griswold Goodrich of New England, whose first Peter Parley book, <span class="italic">Tales of Peter Parley about America</span>, appeared in 1827, and which was followed by a series of similar, highly successful tales at the rate of five or six volumes a year. Darton notes that &#145;in thirty years over 7,000,000 copies of some 116 <i>genuine</i> Parleys were sold&#146; and that Goodrich was therefore eminently &#145;worth pirating&#146; by English authors and publishers  (ibid., 227). Martin was one of several English &#145;Peter Parleys&#146; to take up the idea of short, explanatory, and entertaining narratives for the school and home tutoring market. Others were the writer George Mogridge (<span class="italic">Sergeant Bell and his Raree-Show</span>, 1839) and the publishers Thomas Tegg, Charles Tilt, Edward Lacey, and Samuel Clark. Martin, however, was regarded by Goodrich in his memoirs as the most successful&#151;or troublesome. Martin wrote <span class="italic">Peter Parley's Tales for Boys and Girls at Home and Abroad</span> (<i>c</i>.1835) and produced many numbers of <span class="italic">Peter Parley's Magazine</span> for the publishers Darton and Clark, who began this as a monthly publication in 1839, and then bound it up in a gift book at Christmas as <span class="italic">Peter Parley's Annual: a Christmas and New Year's Present for Young People</span> (1840). The magazine ceased publication in 1863, while the annual continued until 1892 under different editors and various imprints. Other Parley titles attributed to Martin include <span class="italic">Peter Parley's Tales for Youth</span> (<i>c</i>.1844) and <span class="italic">Peter Parley's Tales about Kings &amp; Queens</span> (1848).<br>
<br>Martin also continued with educational publishing, editing the <span class="italic">British Annals of Education</span> (1844) and producing several successful schoolbooks, among which were <span class="italic">The Intellectual Expositor and Vocabulary</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Intellectual Reading Book</span> (1851), and <span class="italic">The Intellectual Grammar</span> (1852). He used another pseudonym, Old Chatty Cheerful, for <span class="italic">The Boy's Own Annual</span> (1861) and a series of <span class="roman">Household Tracts for the People</span> with titles that included <span class="italic">Household Management, or, How to Make Home Comfortable</span> (1861); <span class="italic">How to Rise in the World to Respectability, Independence and Usefulness</span> (1861), and <span class="italic">Men who have fallen from wealth, fame and respectability, to poverty, shame and degradation, from a want of principle</span> (1861). His range and versatility in writing and editing popular works for adults and young people gave him the reputation of &#145;a very capable, all-round hack&#146;  (Darton, 224). He was also considered to have been a man of dissipated habits and loose morals in his later years, giving his friends some anxiety. He died at his home, Holly Lodge, Woodbridge, Suffolk, on 22 October 1867, and was buried in the cemetery there. He married three times, and was survived by his third wife, Harriet Agnes, and two sons.<br>
