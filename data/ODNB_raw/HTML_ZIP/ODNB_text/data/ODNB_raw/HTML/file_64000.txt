<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill, Dame  Elizabeth Mary</span>  (1900&#150;1996), <span class="occ">Russian and Slavonic scholar</span>, was born on 24 October 1900 in St Petersburg, Russia, the fifth of the six children (and second of the three daughters) of Frederick William Hill (1860&#150;1924), merchant, and his wife, Louisa Maria Wilhelmina Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller (1862&#150;1929). She was baptized Bessie May and, many years later, changed her name by deed poll to Elizabeth Mary. Her father was British and her mother Russian (although of Austro-Prussian descent), and Elizabeth grew up fluent in four languages (English, French, German, and Russian). In 1917 the family left Russia and their privileged place in the British community, settled in London, and faced a life of increasing penury.<br>
<br>Three and a half happy years as the &#145;French mamzelle&#146; at Penrhos College, north Wales, preceded Hill's studies in Russian from 1921 at University and King's colleges, London, which resulted in a first-class degree in 1924. In 1931 she completed her PhD on the early nineteenth-century Russian psychological novel, under the supervision of Prince D. S. Mirsky. During these years and subsequently, she supported herself by constant lecturing, coaching, and above all translating. With her great friend Doris Mudie (of the Mudie's Library family) she translated from French and particularly from Russian, including letters written by Dostoyevsky to his wife (1930) and by Lenin (1937), and, under the pseudonym J. Penn, produced <span class="italic">For Readers Only</span> (1936), a lively book of anecdotes (including one about an attack on Mirsky by an unsought admirer of Hill) and reminiscences of countless hours spent happily in the British Museum reading room.<br>
<br>It was 1936 that brought Hill's appointment at the University of Cambridge as lecturer in Slavonic, which in those years had its refuge in the department of other languages. Only in 1948, when women were awarded degrees at Cambridge for the first time, was the department of Slavonic studies established and Elizabeth Hill elected to the professorship. On her fiftieth birthday (24 October 1950) she delivered her inaugural lecture, published as <span class="italic">Why Need we Study the Slavs?</span> (1951), by which time she headed a department of ten lecturers, teaching Czech, Polish, Serbo-Croat, and Russian to growing numbers of undergraduates. Her competence in several of these languages&#151;notably Serbo-Croat&#151;notwithstanding, it was with the teaching of, and propaganda for, the Russian language that she was inevitably and justly linked. During the Second World War she was attached to the Ministry of Information as a Slavonic specialist, and it was largely as a result of her persuasion that the War Office agreed to set up intensive Russian-language courses at Cambridge. These were to continue during the period of national service and, in parallel with similar courses at the University of London, provided Britain with well-trained Russian linguists, many of whom pursued their studies at universities and achieved prominent positions in academe, the diplomatic service, and business.<br>
<br>Lisa, which is how generations of <i>kursanty</i> (participants in the services' courses) and undergraduates remembered her, was a legendary figure, black-suited, piercingly blue-eyed, and with hair swept back; and, as many Cambridge gateposts and policemen would have testified, an idiosyncratic interpreter in her black Fiat, nicknamed the Flea, of the highway code. She inspired people with a love of Russian and things Slavonic, encouraged and cajoled them, but she herself was not a publishing scholar. As one of her obituarists noted: &#145;she wrote almost nothing original, yet she was the direct inspirational force behind dozens of serious articles and books by other people&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 6 Jan 1997). In her posthumously published memoirs, <span class="italic">In the Mind's Eye</span> (1999), she wrote of her &#145;creative dreams&#146;, of her work on Slavonic curses and spells in the 1920s, and of the devoted search for the &#145;truth&#146; about the death of Tsar Alexander I that dominated her last years, &#145;but life forced me into other activities and another mould &hellip; in Cambridge it was my mission and my way to develop Slavonic Studies that obsessed me&#146;  (<span class="italic">In the Mind's Eye</span>, 218&#150;19). Her memoirs, written with great humour, <i>&eacute;lan</i>, and prejudice, but sadly unfinished, are her literary legacy, with their parade of wonderful characters, British and Slav, and endless tales, honed over the years by an accomplished raconteur. Her &#145;mission&#146; she nevertheless fulfilled, with enormous dedication and energy, and not the least of her great contributions was the building up of the substantial Slavonic holdings in the Cambridge university and departmental libraries.<br>
<br>On her retirement from Cambridge, Hill became Andrew Mellon professor of Slavic languages and literatures at the University of Pittsburgh (1968&#150;70). In 1976 she was made a DBE and in 1978 she received an honorary doctorate from the University of East Anglia. She was a professorial fellow of Girton College, Cambridge, a fellow of University College, London, from 1946, and on the occasion of her ninetieth birthday she was made an honorary fellow of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London.<br>
<br>In 1984, at the age of eighty-four, Hill married the Serbian aristocrat Stojan Veljkovi&#263; (1906&#150;1998), whom she divorced three months before her death. Her account of that marriage and its end forms a sad and bitter coda to her memoirs. She had hoped to return to her home at 10 Croft Gardens, Cambridge, where she had lived since 1936, but she died of a heart attack at 77 Park Road, Chiswick, London, on 17 December 1996. After a funeral service in the Russian Orthodox cathedral in Ennismore Gardens, London, on 31 December, she was buried in Grantchester churchyard, reunited with her companion Doris Mudie (<i>d</i>. 1970).<br>
