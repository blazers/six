<span class="headword">Hogan,  John</span>  (1800&#150;1858), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 14 October 1800 in Tallow, co. Waterford, the son of John Hogan, a building contractor, and his wife, Frances Cox (<i>d</i>. 1823), who came from a landowning gentry family in Cork. When he was a child his family moved to Cork. He was apprenticed to Michael Foote, a Cork solicitor, and in 1818 joined the architectural firm of Thomas Deane where his father was foreman. At the Academy of Casts in Cork, which he attended from 1820 to 1822, he drew from casts of the Vatican marbles, made under the supervision of Canova and presented by Pope Pius VII to the prince regent who sent them in 1818 to the Cork Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts. He began to exhibit in Cork in 1821 and was commissioned by the Roman Catholic bishop of Cork, John Murphy, to carve twenty-seven small wooden figures of saints for St Mary's Cathedral. His work was seen by William Paulet Carey, an engraver and publicist, who successfully induced Sir John Fleming-Leicester, Lord De Tabley, and others, to subscribe to send Hogan to Rome. He thus left Cork in January 1824, stopping in London where he met Francis Chantrey and Sir Thomas Lawrence, and arrived in Rome at Easter. There he studied at the English Academy and at the Vatican and Capitoline museums. In 1825 he set up his studio at vicolo degli Incurabili 8, near the Corso, and in 1827 he visited Naples. During the late 1820s he established himself in the wake of Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen with a series of ideal subjects: <span class="italic">The Italian Shepherd Boy</span> (1825, formerly Powerscourt, co. Wicklow), <span class="italic">The Dancing Faun</span> (1826, Crawford Municipal Art Gallery, Cork), <span class="italic">Eve Startled at the Sight of Death</span> (1827, formerly Lord De Tabley collection), and <span class="italic">The Dead Christ</span> (1829, St Teresa, Dublin), which was shown at the Royal Academy in London in 1832. He married Cornelia Bevignani on 11 November 1837. They had seven daughters and four sons, of whom one, John Valentine Hogan, became a sculptor in Rome.<br>
<br>Hogan revisited Ireland in 1829, 1833, 1840, 1842, 1843, and 1846 to deal with clients and receive commissions. Most of his work was commissioned by Irish middle-class patrons who had need for commemorative and religious sculpture following Catholic emancipation in 1829. He produced a series of religious works, one of which was a <i>piet&agrave;</i> (1843) for Loreto Abbey at Rathfarnham, south of Dublin. In 1837 he won the competition for a memorial to Bishop James Doyle (1840) for Carlow Cathedral, which led to commissions for statues of Irish national heroes&#151;notably Daniel O'Connell (1846, City Hall, Dublin; 1856, Limerick) and Thomas Davis (1852, City Hall, Dublin). The finest of these was the marble group <span class="italic">Hibernia with a Bust of Lord Cloncurry</span> (1844, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). He made a large number of funerary reliefs, notably those for Jeanette Farrell (1843, St Andrew's, Dublin), Bishop John Brinkley (1845, Trinity College, Dublin), and Bishop Fleming (1853, St John's, Newfoundland), and received commissions for busts of numerous Roman Catholic clergy such as Bishop Murphy (1834, Cork), Father Theobald Matthew (1844, Capuchin friary, Church Street, Dublin), and Archbishop Daniel Murray (1844, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin).<br>
<br>Hogan was recognized in Rome, where a reproduction of his <i>piet&agrave;</i> was published in <span class="italic">L'Ape italiana</span> (1837) and praised by Thorvaldsen. He was honoured by being made a member of the Virtuosi of the Pantheon in 1839 and from 1840 he began to receive critical notices in Ireland. After the Roman revolution of 1848&#150;9 he returned to Ireland and settled at 14 Wentworth Place, Dublin. His final work, completed by Giovanni Benzoni after his death, was the gigantic bronze relief of <span class="roman">Civil and Religious Liberty</span> (Wellington Testimonial, Dublin).<br>
<br>Hogan's style was based on Roman neo-classicism, which he used for Irish national and religious imagery, reflecting the political and social changes of the period. He died at his home in Wentworth Place on 27 March 1858; his funeral took place on 30 March, followed by burial at Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin. A civil-list pension was granted to his widow.<br>
