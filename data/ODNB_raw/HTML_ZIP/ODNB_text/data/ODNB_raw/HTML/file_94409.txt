<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vane, Sir  John Robert</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">pharmacologist</span>, was born on 29 March 1927 at Ivydene, Hollywood Lane, Wythall, Worcestershire, the third child of Maurice Vane, builder, and his wife, Frances Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher. His father was the son of Russian immigrants while his mother was from a Worcestershire farming family. He attended elementary school locally, and subsequently King Edward VI School, Birmingham. Inspired by the chemistry teacher, Perky Lambert, and aided by a Christmas gift of a chemistry set at the age of twelve, he had developed an interest in experimental science, although his early essays in this art, which were conducted in the family kitchen, came to an abrupt end when a minor explosion showered the wall with chemicals, ruining the d&eacute;cor. His father, whose business was the construction of portable buildings, eventually erected a small laboratory for him in the garden, in which he was able to nurture what became a lifelong passion for experimenting. At King Edward VI School he pursued his interest in science, after which &#145;it seemed natural to move to the University of Birmingham (which was just across the road from the school) to study chemistry&#146;  (Vane, 177). This he did, and graduated BSc in 1946.<br>
<br>There was no hint at this time of the dramatic directions Vane's career would eventually take. He had no biological expertise at all, and in later life he maintained that he became a pharmacologist entirely by accident. Being a confirmed experimentalist by nature he found the actual practice of chemistry, with its emphasis on reaction yield and product purity, rather tedious, but while discussing this issue with his head of department, Maurice Stacey, he learned that Harold Burn in Oxford was seeking graduates to be trained in pharmacology. He later wrote: &#145;without hesitation I grasped the opportunity and immediately went to the library to find out what pharmacology was all about!&#146;  (Vane, 178). It was a sentiment familiar to the practitioners of a discipline which was not, at that time, widely known outside specialist laboratories. Despite this unexpected start he found the study of experimental pharmacology, as practised by Burn, to be fulfilling in a way that chemistry was not. After graduating BSc in pharmacology at Oxford in 1949 he spent a year as a researcher in the pharmacology department at Sheffield University. Evidently he didn't enjoy this experience very much, because while at a British Pharmacological Society meeting he met up with an old Oxford friend, Geoffrey Dawes, and inquired about the possibility of joining him in the Nuffield Institute for Medical Research. Dawes joked about needing someone to clean the glassware and offered him a postgraduate place. In 1953 the bottle washer was duly awarded a DPhil. These years were formative for Vane in more ways than one. While in Oxford he had met (Elizabeth) Daphne Page, a domestic science teacher three years older than him. She was the daughter of Jackson Page, schoolmaster. They married at Lyndhurst Road Congregationalist Chapel, Hampstead, on 5 April 1949, and had two daughters, Nicola and Miranda.<br>
<br>At that time it was common for newly qualified postdoctoral scientists to gain experience in the USA, and Vane was invited by Arnold Welch to join the department of pharmacology at Yale as an assistant professor. Two years later, in 1955, he returned to the UK and joined W. D. M. (Bill) Paton's department of pharmacology at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, originally sited in Queen's Square in London, but subsequently relocated to the Royal College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Fields. In 1960 Paton was succeeded by Gustav (Gus) Born, a friend of Vane's from his Oxford days. Vane rose quickly through the academic hierarchy, becoming a reader in 1961 and gaining a personal chair in 1966. The department, guided by Born and Vane, developed a collegial intellectual environment which nurtured an astonishingly productive team of researchers. It trained many students from the UK and abroad, a large proportion of whom went on to achieve prominence in their own fields. It was within this friendly and intellectually stimulating environment that Vane perfected his signature bio-assay system which enabled him to measure, with astonishing rapidity and specificity, the levels of many blood hormones simultaneously. It was a technique that suited him greatly, for his insights and ideas came quickly and he was impatient to test them.<br>
<br>During his time at the Royal College of Surgeons Vane made two major breakthroughs. Working with Sergio Ferreira, Y. S. Bakhle, K. K. F. Ng, and others, he performed the crucial experimental work demonstrating that inhibition of the generation of the hormone angiotensin II would be a useful therapy for hypertension. At the time he was a consultant for Squibb in the USA where Welch was research director. Welch backed Vane's idea and the result was the development of the ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors, a class of drugs which revolutionized the treatment of hypertension. A few years later, in 1971, Vane executed what is generally regarded as his finest piece of experimental work. Aspirin was a useful analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic drug (and indeed prototype of an entire class of similar medicines) of unknown mechanism of action, that dated back to the 1890s. While writing a review on the release of mediators from the lung one weekend Vane conceived the notion that it worked by inhibiting the generation of prostaglandins, a family of hormones known to be important in initiating inflammation, fever, and pain. He turned again to his bio-assay system for the wherewithal to test this idea, and within a few days was confident that this indeed was the mechanism that had so long eluded the pharmacological community. This concept, which he further developed with Ferreira, Salvador Moncada, and R. J. (Rod) Flower, had a profound influence on the development of future anti-inflammatory drugs as well as resolving a long-standing pharmacological enigma.<br>
<br>The year 1973 saw a change in Vane's circumstances, with the break-up of the Royal College of Surgeons group. Born had accepted the offer of the chair of pharmacology in Cambridge and Vane was offered the position of group research and development director of the Wellcome Foundation, an unusual pharmaceutical company whose profits were gifted to the charitable Wellcome Trust. This presented him with a new and very different set of managerial and scientific challenges. Although he now had little time for laboratory work as such, he continued to influence research directly through his personal &#145;prostaglandin research group&#146;, which he started, bringing several of his old colleagues from the Royal College of Surgeons and encouraging them to &#145;follow their instincts&#146; in the quest for new drugs. Moncada, Richard Gryglewski, and Stuart Bunting from this group soon discovered prostacyclin, a short-lived hormone of the prostaglandin family that dilates blood vessels and prevents platelet aggregation. A chemical derivative was later commercialized for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. During Vane's term as research and development director Wellcome produced several other important drugs, including anti-viral agents, anti-gout drugs, and muscle relaxants.<br>
<br>Vane's own work was by then widely acclaimed. He had been made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1974, shortly after his move to the Wellcome Foundation, and a series of high-profile international awards followed, among them the Albert Lasker basic medical research award in 1977. In 1982 he won the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine, together with Bengt Samuelsson and Sune Bergstr&ouml;m, for his work on the prostaglandin field. He was knighted in the new year's honours list of 1984, for services to pharmaceutical science. Over fifty honorary degrees and fellowships followed over the years.<br>
<br>Vane left the Wellcome Foundation in 1986. A less energetic man might have taken a well-earned retirement, but he had other plans. An invitation to set up a laboratory on the Charterhouse Square campus of St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school, coupled with some start-up funding from Glaxo Group Research, provided him with a new opportunity. His technique, under such circumstances, was to build around him a group of trusted and respected colleagues that he felt able to work with. He invited teams headed by Born, Flower, Erik &Auml;ngg&aring;rd, Iain MacIntyre, Brendan Whittle, Derek Willoughby, and David Tomlinson to join him and to establish a &#145;federation&#146; of (mainly self-funded) scientists devoted to research into inflammation and cardiovascular disease. His vision culminated in the formation in 1991 of the William Harvey Research Institute as a separate, free-standing medical charity within the medical college. Expansion was facilitated by major funding from Ono Pharmaceuticals in Japan and in time the institute employed some 120 people, and &#145;spun off&#146; a small commercial company and conference organization. Although rarely doing laboratory work himself during this period, Vane, working with a new generation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, focused his interests on hormones influencing the heart and blood vessels as well as the pharmacology of the COX-2 inhibitors. He retired as full-time director in 1995 but still maintained his office in the institute and continued to influence the course of research and to direct young people. Following the merger of the institute with the medical college in 2000 he took over the role of honorary chairman of the charitable William Harvey Research Foundation.<br>
<br>Like many scientists Vane was a committed internationalist. His boast was that UK scientists usually constituted a minority in his laboratories, and at the William Harvey Research Institute he once counted scientists from seventeen nationalities on the roster. He had developed a particularly close relationship with the Polish scientific community. Beginning in the late 1960s, during the cold war era, invariably accompanied by his wife, Daphne, he travelled to Poland virtually every year, often bringing scarce scientific equipment and reagents with him. He invited many of the Polish scientists he met to visit the West or to work in his laboratory, and during these visits he made many close friends. In 2003, on the occasion of his last visit, he was awarded the Polish order of merit in recognition of his contributions to Anglo-Polish scientific collaboration, a rare honour for a foreign scientist.<br>
<br>Although rather shy by nature, Vane was a very sociable person, loyal to his friends and generous to his colleagues. He and his family were lavish in their entertainment, whether at their home or at numerous restaurants and venues around the world. Their summer garden parties were much anticipated events in the social calendar. Daphne Vane, ever the graceful hostess, seemed unperturbed by the constant influx of scientists into her home despite the fact that her own background was in the liberal arts. Close colleagues were adopted as part of an &#145;extended family&#146; that burgeoned as the Vanes made many lifelong friends.<br>
<br>Vane's legacy consisted of the drugs that he was directly or indirectly responsible for producing, some of which became among the most utilized of any in the pharmacological arsenal. He championed the scientific evaluation of medicines and their mechanisms of action, and in doing so perpetuated a tradition that had driven the pharmacological agenda since the discipline began. He strongly disapproved of the claimed health benefits, unsupported by good evidence, of the many unregulated substances on display in pharmacies and health food shops. In 1992 he underwent heart surgery and made an excellent recovery, but a further procedure in 2002 took its toll. An unlucky fall resulting in a fractured hip together with subsequent complications confined him to his bed. He died peacefully at the Princess Royal University Hospital, Farnborough, on 19 November 2004, of pneumonia. He was survived by his wife and daughters.<br>
