<span class="headword">Radisson,  Pierre-Esprit</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Oninga]</span>  (1639/40?&#150;1710), <span class="occ">explorer and trader</span>, was probably born in Paris&#151;as documents in New France testify that his sisters were&#151;to Avignonese parents, Pierre-Esprit Radisson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1590) and Madeleine H&eacute;naut. In affidavits of 1697 and 1698 Radisson swore he was sixty-one and sixty-two (so born in 1636), but the census of New France in 1681 reports him as forty-one (thus born in 1639 or 1640); he describes himself as almost beardless in 1659, so the latter is possible. Some Hudson's Bay Company records, perhaps confused by his Avignonese connection, call him an Italian; Radisson states he had visited Italy, but not when. Nothing is known of his childhood, but his handwriting, a confident, casual italic, hints that his parents may have intended him for a career in professional life or lesser court service. His narratives exhibit few literary or historical allusions. He arrived in New France (modern Quebec) in 1651 to join his half-sister Marguerite Hayet Veron. In 1653 she married, as his second wife, <a name="cosubject_74473"></a><span class="headword">M&eacute;dard Chouart</span>  (1618&#150;<em>c.</em>1695)<span class="occ"></span>, sieur des Groseilliers (usually known as Groseilliers), who had been born in Charly-sur-Marne, the son of M&eacute;dard Chouart and Marie Poirier and baptized on 31 July 1618; he had emigrated to New France about 1641. Radisson and Groseilliers were partners in exploration from at least 1659 until 1684.<h2>
<a name="Earlyjourneys"></a>Early journeys</h2>Radisson arrived in New France amid Iroquois attempts to eradicate Huron middlemen and dominate Native trade with Europeans; Iroquois raids had left the sparse settlers between Quebec and Montreal in daily fear for their lives. The youth was shortly captured by Mohawks while duck-hunting with foolhardy friends. As he recounts in his <span class="italic">Voyages</span> (begun about 1668), after an attempt to escape, he survived the ordeal of ritual torture (<span class="italic">Voyage I</span>), and was adopted by a Mohawk family, living for eighteen months as a Native before reluctantly escaping to the Dutch at Fort Orange (Albany). (His name as a Mohawk was Oninga.) Groseilliers, after serving in the mid-1640s with the Jesuits to the west in Huronia (southern Ontario), settled at Trois Rivi&egrave;res and began laying plans, possibly on the basis of information from his first wife's relatives, to explore the resources of the interior. In 1654&#150;6, with an unknown French companion, Groseilliers travelled beyond Huronia and possibly as far as the headwaters of the Mississippi. Radisson's controversial <span class="italic">Voyage III</span> is a suspiciously sketchy account of this journey, in which he claims to have taken part, but a document attests he was in Quebec in 1655. In 1657&#150;8 Radisson accompanied Father Paul Rageneau and other Jesuits to a new mission among the Onondaga, who played an important role in the complex diplomatic life of the then Five Nations. <span class="italic">Voyage II</span> describes the violence-plagued journey and the ruses the Jesuits eventually used to evacuate their mission.<br>
<br>In August 1659 Radisson and Groseilliers left on the great journey chronicled in Radisson's superb <span class="italic">Voyage IV</span>, which led directly to the founding of the Hudson's Bay Company. A French edict forbade independent trading for furs, so they left Trois Rivi&egrave;res stealthily with their Saulteaux companions, escaping marauding Iroquois whom they fought and, Radisson relates, whose flesh they consumed. Their journey took them past Sault St Marie, along Lake Superior's south shore, the beauty of which delighted Radisson, and beyond Chequamegon in Wisconsin. They met with Hurons dispersed by the war, spent a winter of famine, and participated in a great Feast of the Dead. This important Huron-Ojibwa ritual was also an opportunity for diplomacy; the explorers treated for peace, essential for a profitable fur trade, with &#145;eighten severall nations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Voyages</span>, 209), including the Lakota (Sioux). Later they visited the Sioux on the edge of the prairie in Minnesota. They travelled to the north shore of Lake Superior and even, according to Radisson, reached James Bay; however, his report is vague and Groseilliers may have travelled alone. Earlier scholars doubted such a journey, but expert canoeists now testify that it would have been possible using established Native river routes and portages. The two explorers returned to New France in August 1660 with a rich bounty of furs, only to be treated as outlaws by Governor D'Argenson.<h2>
<a name="TheHudsonsBayCompany"></a>The Hudson's Bay Company</h2>Groseilliers approached a French merchant at La Rochelle to exploit northern beaver, but the resulting expedition failed. Between 1662 and 1665 he and Radisson made other attempts to reach the Bay, seeking support in New England and New Holland. Two contemporaries claimed that the wily Groseilliers aided the English in their capture of Manhattan in 1664. In 1665 the British envoy in New England, Colonel George Cartwright, believing they had discovered a north-west passage, sent them to Charles II in London. News of the arrival of the explorers &#145;and of a great trade in beaver in that passage&#146;  (Rich, 1.24) circulated rapidly, as a letter to Robert Boyle shows. They arrived during the plague of 1665, and may have witnessed the great fire of London, though Radisson does not mention it. The king, then at Oxford, was deeply interested in their news of riches in beaver (in great demand), their obvious experience, and their concept of a trade operating out of Hudson Bay independent of the heavily taxed overland route employed by the French at Quebec. He gave them an allowance, put them in contact with possible investors, and encouraged them to remain at court.<br>
<br>War with the Dutch frustrated quick action, but two ships attempted an experimental expedition to the Bay in 1668. Beaten by storm, Radisson's had to turn back, and he spent the winter alone in London, where internal evidence suggests he composed his four <span class="italic">Voyages</span>, possibly at the king's command, or in the circle of Prince Rupert, an early supporter of the Hudson's Bay Company. The manuscript dedication is &#145;A la plus grande gloire de Dieu&#146;, but it is Radisson who is the centre of events. A lively narrator, at once self-aggrandizing and unashamed of his own fears, he concentrates on the shrewd observation of human action rather than the description of landscape. Writing in a vivacious Francophone English (the four <span class="italic">Voyages</span> are not translations as once was thought), he planned the narratives with care, as textual cross-references show. Preserved in a scribal copy of about 1686&#150;7 once owned by Samuel Pepys, they were discovered in the Bodleian Library in 1885.<br>
<br>On 2 May 1670 the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's Bay received their royal charter, making the eighteen investors &#145;the True and absolute Lordes and Proprietors&#146;  (Rich, 1.53) of nearly 40 per cent of today's Canada. Radisson and Groseilliers spent 1670&#150;74 advising the company and travelling to the Bay. During this time, in 1672 or 1674, Radisson married a daughter of Sir John Kirke, probably named Mary, from a family influential in the early history of Newfoundland; they had two children: a son, Matthew and a daughter, Hannah.<h2>
<a name="Laterjourneys"></a>Later journeys</h2>However, in 1675 the partners, finding their advice rejected and persuaded by a captive Jesuit in London, returned to France with the assurance that Colbert would support their trading plans. Colbert, however, wanted Radisson to bring his wife to France as a testimony of good faith. Kirke and his brothers had many claims against France and he refused to let his daughter leave, possibly because the brothers, born in Dieppe, were regarded as French themselves. Further frustrated by inaction in New France, Radisson became a soldier of fortune, participating in Admiral Jean d'Estr&eacute;e's 1677&#150;8 naval expedition against the Dutch in Africa and the Caribbean and sending a vivid, closely written four-page report to his then patron, the geographically inclined Abb&eacute; Claude Bernou. Recently discovered documents indicate that the so-called &#145;Petitions&#146;, in which Radisson described North America, were chiefly records of his debriefing by Bernou.<br>
<br>In 1682, supported by entrepreneurs in New France, Radisson and Groseilliers returned to the Bay, establishing a post on the Nelson River at Hudson Bay where the company had been trading. A three-way stalemate ensued when the Quebec party, a company ship, and traders from New England arrived almost simultaneously. &#145;I thought it better to surprise them than that they should me&#146;, Radisson wrote, and in a series of cunning manoeuvres swiftly gained control of the situation. But when he and Groseilliers, returning to Quebec, attempted to avoid tax on their booty they were packed off to France. There they found Colbert dead and the regime opposed to trading by colonists and increasingly sensitive to the claims of England in the north being urged by the English ambassador-extraordinary, Richard Graham, Viscount Preston. Possibly with the connivance of the French and certainly encouraged by Sir James Hayes, secretary of the Hudson's Bay Company, Radisson was persuaded to defect to English allegiance. Groseilliers sailed for New France, where he died about 1695; the two may never have met again. Radisson reached London in May 1684. Within weeks he took ship for the Bay, where the party from Quebec he had left behind under the leadership of Groseilliers's son was astounded by his return as an agent of the English. They submitted to his persuasions, and departed for England with a considerable cargo of furs.<h2>
<a name="London"></a>London</h2>Returning to London Radisson&#151;presumably now a widower&#151;married, on 3 March 1685 in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Charlotte, the daughter of G&eacute;d&eacute;on Godet, Preston's go-between in his earlier negotiations; they had three sons, Peter-Espritt, John, and William. He defended his stratagems of 1682&#150;4 in the two Port Nelson <span class="italic">Relations</span>, written in French; these, along with later depositions, became important testimony in the lengthy negotiations between France and England over territorial rights in Hudson Bay, eventually confirmed as England's by the treaty of Utrecht (1713). As a symbol of his fealty to England and the new regime, Radisson dedicated to James II two fine manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Relations</span>, now at Windsor Castle. For a time there was a price on his head in New France, but Radisson served the Hudson's Bay Company as superintendent of trade at Port Nelson in 1685&#150;7 and then retired to London. When James II fled, the ageing explorer was left to the protection of Marlborough, but had to struggle for his company pension and stock dividends throughout the 1690s; between 1692 and 1697 he was pursuing a suit in chancery against the London committee of the company, whose deputy governor Sir Edward Dering seems to have opposed his just claims. Probably in or before 1692 he married for a third time; his new wife's name was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1732) but her surname and parentage are unknown. They had at least one daughter, Elizabeth Sophia. Despite earlier prosperity Radisson left his family in poverty when he died. He made his will on 17 June 1710, still insisting on his right to profits on the furs he had brought to the company in 1684. He was buried at St Clement Danes on 21 June 1710, described by parish records as a decayed gentleman.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Radisson, a man of &#145;versatility and exuberance&#146;  (Nute, <span class="italic">DCB</span>, 2.539), lived precariously at the intersection of courtly, mercantile, and Native worlds. Regarded by English contemporaries as a rascal and by the French as a traitor, he was nevertheless a distinguished explorer and a significant figure in England's vexed relationship with France. Radisson acquired Native languages quickly, and few documents give such an authentic ethnographical account of Iroquois domestic and military life as his first two narratives. Whether he was present or not, his third <span class="italic">Voyage</span> reports on possibly the first European sighting of the Mississippi headwaters; and his fourth <span class="italic">Voyage</span> provides the first written account of the area around Lake Superior and west to the beginning of the prairie in Minnesota. The Port Nelson <span class="italic">Relations</span> document a critical episode in the seventeenth-century struggle over Hudson Bay. In maintaining England's ability to sustain its claim in the area, Radisson's actions of 1684 were decisive, confirming the Hudson's Bay Company&#151;one of the smaller London trading companies&#151;as an imperial actor in North America and in the formation of what was to become present-day Canada.<br>
<br>Radisson's modern reputation is fraught with ironies; little known after his death, he was much studied in the decades after the 1885 rediscovery of his first four <span class="italic">Voyages</span>, but chiefly by Americans who, because of his 1660 sojourn on the south shore of Lake Superior, honour him as a founder of the state of Wisconsin. Quebec historiography until recently has treated him with deep suspicion because of his defection to the English. To English-Canadian schoolchildren he and his companion traditionally were known as &#145;Radishes and Gooseberries&#146;, and Radisson was the hero of a popular young people's television series in the 1960s. Early in the twentieth century a contest for the name of a new hotel in St Paul, Minnesota was won by a schoolgirl who proposed the name Radisson; from this the worldwide hotel chain evolved. His name has also been attached to La Radissonie, a remote area of northern Quebec which he never visited. Perhaps more fittingly, the London street where this gifted exploiter of international trading politics expired lies today beneath the Clare Court building of the London School of Economics.<br>
