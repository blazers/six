<span class="headword">Townshend,  Charles</span>, first Baron Bayning  (1728&#150;1810), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 27 August 1728 in Twickenham, Middlesex, was the only son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27637/', "Hon. William Townshend (1702&#150;1738)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Townshend, Charles, second Viscount Townshend")</script>], politician, and his wife, Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1755), the daughter of Lord William Paulet and his second wife, Anne Egerton. Both his parents came from powerful whig families, for his father was the third surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Charles Townshend, second Viscount Townshend (1674&#150;1738)")</script>, and his mother was the granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21613/', "Charles Paulet, first duke of Bolton (1630/31&#150;1699)")</script>. He was educated at Eton College (1742&#150;5) and Clare College, Cambridge, and graduated MA in 1749. He was appointed secretary to the British embassy at Madrid on 17 September 1751, and remained in Spain for four years. Henceforth he became known as &#145;Spanish Charles&#146;, in contradistinction to his brilliant namesake and cousin, the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27619/', "Charles Townshend (1725&#150;1767)")</script>.<br>
<br>Townshend left Madrid in January 1755 following his mother's death and returned to England. At the general election of 1756 he succeeded his cousin Charles as member for Great Yarmouth, which his father had previously represented from 1723 to 1738. He remained the city's MP until 1784. He acted generally with the Rockingham whigs, but was not prominent as a speaker, and is reported to have spoken on only three occasions in the 1768&#150;74 parliament. He was present at the great gathering of whigs held at Claremont, Newcastle's house at Esher, on 30 June 1765, and was one of the minority there who advised against taking office without Pitt. When, however, Rockingham became premier, Townshend was made a lord of the Admiralty, on 16 July 1765. In February 1770 he exchanged this office for a commissionership of the Treasury under North, with whom he became closely associated. He was sworn of the privy council on 20 June 1777 and on 17 September was appointed joint vice-treasurer of Ireland. On 21 August 1777 he married his cousin Annabella Smith (<i>d</i>. 1825), the daughter of the Revd Richard Smith and his wife, Annabella, who was a granddaughter of Lord William Paulet. They had three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In the Fox&#150;North coalition ministry of 1783 Townshend held the office of treasurer of the navy. Faced with an opposition of independents and dissenters who were united against the coalition, he declined to stand for re-election at Great Yarmouth at the 1784 general election. He was returned on the family interest in 1790 and finally retired from parliament in 1796. As one of the Portland whigs, he gave his support to Pitt in 1794, and was created a peer on 20 October 1797, with the title of Baron Bayning of Foxley. In 1807 he was elected high steward of Yarmouth in succession to his uncle George Townshend, first Marquess Townshend.<br>
<br>Townshend died after a few hours' illness on 19 May 1810, aged eighty-one. His widow, who became heir of her brother Powlett Smith-Powlett of Sombourne, Hampshire, died at Chislehurst on 3 January 1825. Of their eight children, the two surviving sons, Charles Frederick Powlett Townshend (1785&#150;1823) and Henry Powlett (1797&#150;1866), who assumed by royal licence the name of his maternal great-grandfather, William Powlett, both died without heirs, and on the death of the younger in 1866 the peerage became extinct.<br>
