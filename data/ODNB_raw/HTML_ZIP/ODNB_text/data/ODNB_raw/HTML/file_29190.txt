<span class="headword">Wheeler,  Thomas</span>  (1754&#150;1847), <span class="occ">apothecary and botanist</span>, second son of Thomas Wheeler (<i>bap</i>. 1710, <i>d</i>. 1769/70), and his wife, Susan Rivington, was born on 24 June 1754 in Basinghall Street, London, where his father practised as an apothecary. Mrs Cibber, the actress, was his father's first cousin. His grandfather, John Wheeler, surgeon to the Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals, died in 1740 during his year of office as master of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company. Thomas Wheeler received his elementary education under the Revd David Garrow, the father of Sir William Garrow, at Hadley, Middlesex, and was admitted a pupil at St Paul's School on 25 January 1765, where he became an excellent classical scholar. After leaving St Paul's he was apprenticed to his father on 5 July 1768 for eight years. He gained his freedom of the Society of Apothecaries on 4 July 1775 by patrimony, as his father had died a few years before. On 24 July that year he entered St Thomas's Hospital as a pupil of Mr Whitfield, one of the apothecaries. Wheeler spent a year at St Thomas's, and it is probable that he then worked at the firm of Truesdale and Partridge, royal apothecaries.<br>
<br>From an early age Wheeler showed a great interest in botany, a taste which was fostered by William Hudson, the botanical demonstrator at the Society of Apothecaries. On 18 March 1778 Wheeler was appointed &#145;Botanic Demonstrator &hellip; at the usual salary and an additional 40<i>s</i>. for the summer excursion&#146;, so making a total of &pound;32 a year  (Society of Apothecaries, MS 8200/9), at the physic garden at Chelsea, London, in succession to William Curtis. In 1784 Wheeler began a series of lectures on botany in the library of the Apothecaries' Hall, but the poor attendance deterred him from continuing it after 1786. In 1783 he was living in George Street, Foster Lane, when he was appointed assistant apothecary to Joseph Roberts at Christ's Hospital; &#145;being [a] very sober, diligent and knowing man in his business, and living near the hospital [he] will be ready on any call to attend&#146;  (Christ's Hospital, MS 12,806/12, fol. 368). Wheeler held the position until September 1801, when he was made apothecary. He resigned in December 1806 as he had been, &#145;favor'd with the appointment of Apothecary to St Bartholomews' Hospital&#146;  (ibid., MS 12,806/13, fol. 490). His salary as a result had now been increased from &pound;250 a year to &pound;350 with &#145;a house rent and taxes free&#146;  (Church, 26). He resigned in June 1821, when he was succeeded by his second son, Charles West Wheeler; in 1822 his third son, James Lowe Wheeler, succeeded him as botanical demonstrator at the Society of Apothecaries. Wheeler had married Ann Blatch (<i>d</i>. 1800) of Amesbury, at Pancras Old Church, on 24 June 1789, and they had six sons, all of whom were freemen of the Society of Apothecaries and practised medicine.<br>
<br>Wheeler was admitted an assistant of the Society of Apothecaries on 29 June 1815; he served as junior and then senior warden between 1821 and 1823, and he was master in 1823&#150;4. He was also appointed a member on 19 July 1815 of the first court of examiners under the act of that year. On his resignation Wheeler continued to live in London; first with his son Charles in St Bartholomew's, until the latter's resignation in 1835, after which he went to live with his eldest son, Thomas Lowe Wheeler, at 61 Gracechurch Street and then at Newcastle Court, College Hill, Cloak Lane, Queen Street.<br>
<br>Wheeler, a devotee of the doctrines of Linnaeus, was an able botanist, and as a teacher he was eminently successful, the &#145;herborisings&#146; of the Society of Apothecaries under his guidance becoming famous throughout England. He took part in these excursions until 1834, when he was eighty, clad in an old hat, worn suit, and a pair of leather gaiters, but full of good spirits and agility. A man of simple faith and habits Wheeler was a non-smoker and abstained from alcohol, but he would break the ice in order to bathe in winter. He taught himself Hebrew at the age of seventy-five. Wheeler died at his home in Newcastle Court, Queen Street, London, on 10 August 1847 and was buried at Norwood cemetery.<br>
