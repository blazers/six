<span class="headword">Petrie,  Alexander</span>  (<em>c.</em>1594&#150;1662), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister in the Netherlands</span>, was born in Montrose, the third son of Alexander Petrie, merchant burgess of that town. He graduated MA from St Andrews University in 1615 and from 1620 to 1630 was master of the grammar school of Montrose. He was presented to the parish of Rhynd, Perthshire, by Charles I and was ordained in July 1632. According to Robert Baillie, he wrote against corrupt episcopal practices and was appointed to a committee to consider such practices by the 1638 Glasgow general assembly.<br>
<br>In 1642 a Scottish church was founded in Rotterdam for the many expatriates who lived there, and Petrie was selected as the first minister by the presbytery of Edinburgh. He arrived in Rotterdam in July 1643 and was inducted by the local Dutch <i>classis</i> in the presence of William Spang, minister of Veere, on 30 August. The Dutch states and city authorities provided the salary and building (initially a former warehouse belonging to a wine merchant), and the church formed part of the Dutch Reformed church, though it was exempt from some aspects of normal Dutch practice.<br>
<br>Petrie's incumbency came during a period when the fledgeling kirk faced disruption from independency and millenarianism in the Netherlands. Soon after his arrival Petrie published <span class="italic">Chiliasto-mastix</span> (1644) to refute the millenarianism of Robert Maton's <span class="italic">Israel's Redemption</span> (1642); there were also heated disputes within the congregation on the exposition of scripture, which were only resolved when Petrie appealed directly to the Church of Scotland authorities. In April 1645 Robert Baillie and George Gillespie, who had been driven to the Dutch coast by a storm, advised Petrie on how to deal with Robert Nasmyth, a troublesome member of the church, and on the same visit they asked the Scots conservator to support the minister and elders in their efforts to maintain discipline. Nevertheless, as late as 1650 Petrie was appealing to the local Dutch church authorities for help in restoring peace to his disordered congregation. He was a strong disciplinarian, not known for his patience, and complained to the authorities of the work involved in caring for such a &#145;Rouwe Gemeente&#146; (&#145;raw congregation&#146;); his portrait, still displayed in the Rotterdam kirk at the beginning of the twenty-first century, depicts a man of stern and determined temperament. Keen to have responsibility for the spiritual care of all Scots in Rotterdam, he sought to ensure that all Scottish marriages and baptisms took place in his kirk (between 1643 and 1660 there are records of 734 baptisms and more than 1100 new members) and a poor fund was established to assist the less fortunate. The ultimate success of the new kirk was largely his, and he gained respect from his congregation and from fellow theologians.<br>
<br>Petrie kept the church as close as possible to developments in Scotland: in January 1644 the solemn league and covenant was subscribed publicly in the church, and throughout the 1640s there were several fast days in support of the Scottish armies. Petrie was also in touch with developments taking place in the Westminster assembly and in 1649 was involved in negotiations with Charles II, who was then in exile in the United Provinces.<br>
<br>Petrie's <i>magnum opus</i> was <span class="italic">A compendious history of the Catholick church, from the year 600 untill the year 1600, showing her deformation and reformation</span>, published in 1662. It was a well-researched history of the Christian church, dedicated to the prince of Orange and containing extracts from the records of the early general assemblies of the Church of Scotland. Petrie did not long survive the publication: his meticulous reports in the church register had been deteriorating since 1654, and he died after a protracted illness on 6 September 1662. He was married (his wife's name is unknown) and was survived by two sons and three daughters, including Alexander (<i>c</i>.1622&#150;1683), minister of the Scottish church at Delft from 1645 to 1668 and 1669 to 1683, and Christian, who married Andrew Snype, minister of the Scots church at Veere.<br>
