<span class="headword">Aylett,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1582&#150;1655), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of Leonard Aylett and Anne Pater of Rivenhall, Essex. He attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1605 and MA in 1608; he was incorporated MA at Oxford. Cambridge awarded him the degree of LLD in 1614, and in 1617 he was admitted as an advocate and began his professional career as an ecclesiastical lawyer.<br>
<br>In 1621 Aylett published his first known volume of poetry, <span class="italic">The Song of Songs which was Salomons, Metaphrased in English Heroiks by Way of Dialogue</span>. The volume also contained books 1 and 2 of <span class="italic">The Brides Ornaments</span>, and an elegy upon the death of John King, bishop of London, who seems to have been his patron. Book 1 of <span class="italic">The Brides Ornaments</span> is dedicated to John Argall: this, combined with the initials R.A. under which the work originally appeared, seems to account for Wood's mistaken attribution of the work to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/639/', "Richard Argall")</script>. Each of the books of <span class="italic">The Brides Ornaments</span> takes five virtues, and offers an extended meditation&#151;in effect, a doctrinal sermon in Spenserian stanzas&#151;upon their qualities.<br>
<br>Further poetry quickly followed. In the next two years Aylett published numerous volumes of religious verse including the meditative <span class="italic">Peace with her Four Garders</span> (1622), and the narrative poems <span class="italic">Susanna</span> (1622) and <span class="italic">Joseph, or, Pharoahs Favourite</span> (1623).<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Aylett's first wife except what he wrote in his autobiographical eclogue on marriage <span class="italic">A Wife, not Ready Made, but Bespoke</span>, that she died soon after their marriage of a &#145;hectic fever&#146;. He married his second wife, Judith Gaell (<i>bap</i>. 1594, <i>d</i>. 1623), on 23 January 1610. He eulogized her in <span class="italic">A Wife not Ready Made</span>, which was written ten years after her death (the poem was entered in the Stationers' register in 1633, although no edition is known until 1653). She was buried on 2 December 1623. On 1 June 1624 Aylett married Penelope, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wiseman, the widow of John Stephens, a barrister.<br>
<br>The year 1625 saw the publication of books 3 and 4 of <span class="italic">The Brides Ornaments</span>, dedicated to King's successor George Montaigne, and to Richard Crakanthorpe, who died before its publication. They were published together with other poems, and dedicated to John Maynard. The volume included a long poetic reworking of Sylvester's translation of Du Bartas's <span class="italic">Urania</span>.<br>
<br>In 1628 Aylett was one of nine appointed by Laud to the court of high commission to push through Laud's reforms and to combat puritanism; he had special responsibility for his home county of Essex. He remained a loyal lieutenant of Laud throughout the years that followed, rising to the post of master in chancery in 1638, in which role he was responsible for legal advice to the House of Lords. Other of his poetical works belong to these years, including <span class="italic">David's Troubles Remembred</span>, a six-book sacred epic written in 3410 lines of rhymed couplets and published anonymously in 1638.<br>
<br>The fall of Laud had potentially serious implications for Aylett, who was named among Laud's followers in the articles of impeachment in February 1641. None the less, he retained his post as master in chancery, and in 1642 was appointed master of the faculties, continuing to work for the House of Lords until 1649.<br>
<br>In 1654 Aylett published <span class="italic">Divine and Moral Speculations in Metrical Numbers</span>, which represented, in effect, his collected works. The volume is dedicated to Henry, marquess of Dorchester, and bears an engraved portrait of Aylett himself. The volume reprints the four books of <span class="italic">The Brides Ornaments</span>, although the first two books were pruned from a combined total of 669 stanzas down to a more manageable 440. It also includes Aylett's autobiographical poem on marriage. His <span class="italic">Devotions</span> were published posthumously in 1655. Aylett's &#145;interminable output of uninspired verse&#146;  (Padelford, &#145;Supplement&#146;, 478) focuses almost exclusively on religious topics, and is heavily influenced by Spenser. Conservative in tone, it is often competent but rarely exciting.<br>
<br>Aylett died on 15 March 1655, at Feering, Essex, where he had lived for more than twenty years. He was buried five days later at Great Braxted church, Essex. His memorial in the church gave his age at death as seventy-three, and on a portrait of 1635 he is said to be fifty-two. His will includes benefactions to Penelope, his wife, and to many local Essex gentry.<br>
