<span class="headword">Davis,  Charles Edward</span>  (1827&#150;1902), <span class="occ">architect and antiquary</span>, was born on 29 August 1827 near Bath, the son of Edward Davis, architect, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker), the widow of Captain Johnston. His father practised in Bath, and had been a pupil of Sir John Soane. In 1833 he restored Prior Birde's Chapel in Bath Abbey church, and in 1834 he published a series of engravings entitled <span class="italic">Gothic Ornaments, etc. of Prior Birde's Oratory</span>, from drawings by Stephen Burchell. He also designed several houses, including Twerton House, near Bath (1838), and laid out the Victoria Park at Bath, which was opened in 1830.<br>
<br>Charles Edward Davis began the study of architecture as his father's pupil. In 1858 he married Selina Anne, the eldest daughter of Captain Howarth. They had no children. In 1863, having won a competition for the cemetery buildings on the Lower Bristol Road, Davis was appointed city architect and surveyor to the corporation of Bath. He held these offices for nearly forty years. In 1863 he designed an escritoire, Bath's wedding gift to the princess of Wales, which was presented in 1869.<br>
<br>Davis is particularly noted for his work on the mineral baths. In 1869 he started an exploration of the site of the hot springs of the old King's bath; he found extensive remains of Roman thermal work and later published <span class="italic">The Excavations of the Roman Baths at Bath</span> (9th edn, 1887; first published in <span class="italic">Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society</span>, 8, 1883&#150;4, 89&#150;113). In 1877&#150;8 he was successful in exposing the Roman well beneath the King's bath. In 1880&#150;81 he discovered the Great bath and in 1884&#150;6 the Circular bath, both Roman.<br>
<br>With a view to collecting information on the nature and management of spas, in 1885 Davis made a tour of the chief continental springs. He applied the knowledge he gained to various improvements which were made at Bath, and he was also consulted by other English corporations who owned natural baths, such as those at Harrogate and Droitwich. He remodelled the spa baths at Woodhall, Lincolnshire, in 1887.<br>
<br>The old Queen's bath, which had been constructed in 1597 and named after Anne, wife of James I, was removed in the course of the Roman discoveries of 1885. Davis's principal new design was for the new Queen's bath (1886&#150;9). This work, and the incidental restoration, met with criticism on structural as well as archaeological grounds. Reports were made on behalf of the Society of Antiquaries by J. H. Middleton and W. H. St John Hope. An independent opinion was sought from Alfred Waterhouse, whose report, dated 14 January 1887, decided that the new works, though somewhat slender in construction, were not likely to be unstable and that on the whole Davis had struck the right balance between utility and antiquarian values.<br>
<br>Besides his work for the corporation, Davis had an extensive private practice. He designed the church dedicated to St Peter and the schools at Twerton, restored several churches, including Northstoke, Somerset (1888), and St Thomas &agrave; Becket at Widcombe, Somerset, and was architect of the Imperial Hotel, Bath, which was opened in 1901. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1854, and published <span class="italic">Mineral Baths of Bath: the Bath of Bathes Ayde in the Reign of Charles II</span> (1883) as well as several pamphlets on the same subject.<br>
<br>The rank of major by which Davis was generally designated was due to his commission in the Worcestershire militia; he had also been a member of the Bath volunteer rifles. He died at his home, Dinmore, 18 Bathwick Hill, Bath, on 10 May 1902. His wife survived him.<br>
