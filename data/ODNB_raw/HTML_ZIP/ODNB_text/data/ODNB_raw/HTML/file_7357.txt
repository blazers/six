<span class="headword">Dawson,  William</span>  (1773&#150;1841), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist preacher</span>, was born on 30 March 1773 at Garforth, near Leeds, the eldest child of Luke Dawson and his wife, Ann Pease. His father was colliery steward to Sir Thomas Gascoigne, bt, of Gawthorpe for twenty-one years. On his father's death in 1791 William succeeded to this post, which included the management of a farm of 150 acres. William, whose parents moved to Barnbow, near Barwick, in his infancy, was educated locally and at the school of a Mr Sanderson at Aberford. His literary ability was noticed by John Graham, curate of Barwick, and others; they hoped to send him to Cambridge with a view to his taking orders in the Church of England. Family and financial reasons put a stop to this plan.<br>
<br>During the Leeds conference of 1793 and subsequently, Dawson heard several eminent Wesleyan ministers, and after long reflection he joined the Wesleyans, becoming an accredited local preacher among them. His popularity steadily increased until he became famous as the eloquent Yorkshire Farmer. He was invited to become an itinerant minister, but his mother and seven young children were dependent upon his income as steward and farmer, and he declined the offer. While working hard as a colliery superintendent and a practical farmer he developed remarkable dramatic powers. On the platform and in the pulpit his natural oratory exercised an unusual charm, moving his audiences to laughter or to tears. He advocated the shortening of the hours of labour in factories and addressed other public issues.<br>
<br>In September 1837 Dawson retired from his employment, and his time became mostly occupied in the opening of chapels, the preaching of anniversary sermons, the advocacy of Christian missions among the heathen, and other charitable objects. From Burmantofts, Leeds, where he now lived, he made preaching tours through the three kingdoms. While at Colne, Lancashire, where he had gone to open a new chapel, he died suddenly on Sunday morning, 4 July 1841.<br>
