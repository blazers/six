<span class="headword">Ray,  Benjamin</span>  (1703/4&#150;1760), <span class="occ">antiquary and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Spalding, Lincolnshire, the son of Joseph Ray, merchant, and his wife, who died early in 1736. He was educated at Spalding grammar school under Timothy Neve, and proceeded to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted a pensioner on 10 October 1721, aged seventeen; he graduated BA in 1725 and MA in 1730. Having left the university he took holy orders and was made perpetual curate of Cowbit and Surfleet, Lincolnshire. From 1723 to 1736 he was master of the grammar school at Sleaford, where he also held a curacy.<br>
<br>In September 1723 Ray was elected a member of the well-known Spalding Gentlemen's Society, in whose foundation his former teacher Neve and his kinsman Maurice Johnson played a prominent part. Ray was secretary in 1735, and afterwards vice-president, and William Stukeley recorded that he exhibited many objects of antiquarian interest at the society's meetings. He composed several unpublished essays, including papers, which he sent to his friend and fellow antiquary Samuel Pegge, on Virgil's fourth eclogue and the ancient numismatic and epigraphic evidence for the coming of the Messiah. Out of these grew a paper delivered to the Spalding Gentlemen's Society entitled &#145;The truth of the Christian religion demonstrated from the report propagated throughout the gentile world about the birth of Christ, that a Messiah was expected, and from the authority of heathen writers, and from the coins of the Roman emperors&#146;. Some of Ray's notes on specific ancient coins appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. To the Royal Society he sent an &#145;Account of a waterspout raised upon land in Lincolnshire&#146;, of which an abstract was published in 1751. He also composed an unpublished account of the Lincolnshire fens, though his native loyalty to that region was not undiluted by resentment, as he held its climate in part responsible for his poor health and the lack of visitors.<br>
<br>Apart from dabbling in poetry (a sample entitled &#145;Manners: a Satyr&#146; survives among his letters to Pegge in the Bodleian Library) Ray also had a penchant for cataloguing and listing. In 1735&#150;6 he composed &#145;A catalogue of the Italian princes and their palaces, &amp; of the Italian painters and their celebrated performances&#146;, which survives in manuscript in the library of Spalding Gentlemen's Society, and also produced &#145;Catalogue of household goods removed out of the Presence Chamber, 26 Chas. II, Dec. 14, 1668&#146;. In 1743, after a visit to Houghton Hall, the earl of Orford's house, he felt moved to send Mrs Pegge a lengthy description of the house and the more prominent works of art in it.<br>
<br>Ray never married, although he had been deeply attached to an unknown party in the 1730s, describing her as &#145;adeo modesta, adeo venusta, ut nihil supra&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. d. 46, fol. 183). She, however, had at length rejected him, partly it seems on the grounds that his living of &pound;80 a year was no better than a porter's wages. This rankled for some years. Repeated approaches to superiors in the hope of gaining richer preferment outside the fens elicited warm compliments on his abilities but no success. His letters to Pegge, many of them entirely antiquarian in content, support the assessment of him in Chalmers's <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span> as a &#145;most ingenious and worthy man, possessed of good learning, but ignorant of the world, indolent and thoughtless, and often very absent&#146;  (Chalmers, 26.73). As an example of the last characteristic Pegge cited the occasion when Ray had jotted down a recipe for punch on one of the pages of the sermon that he was composing for the following Sunday; in delivering the sermon he got halfway through the recipe before realizing what he was saying. He died at Spalding on 26 August 1760.<br>
