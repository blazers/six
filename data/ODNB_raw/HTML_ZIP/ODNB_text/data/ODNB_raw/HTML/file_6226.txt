<span class="headword">Cooper,  Samuel</span>  (1607/8&#150;1672), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born probably in Blackfriars, London, the elder child of Richard Cooper (<i>b</i>. 1577) and Barbara Hoskins (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1590), who were married on 1 September 1607 at the church of St Nicholas Cole Abbey, near Blackfriars. Barbara, the daughter of John Hoskins, at that time an inmate of the Fleet prison although the family was of substance, was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13839/', "John Hoskins (c.1590&#150;1665)")</script>, the miniaturist. Richard Cooper was originally from York, where the family retained its geographical base. About 1610 Richard and Barbara seem to have died or otherwise relinquished the charge of their children, so Samuel and his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6206/', "Alexander Cooper (bap. 1609, d. c.1660)")</script>, were brought up by their uncle John Hoskins, evidently in the neighbourhood of Blackfriars, a district much favoured by artists and craftsmen because of its traditional freedom from the trade restrictions imposed in the rest of the City by the livery companies. There Richard Graham, who knew Cooper and was his earliest biographer, records that Samuel &#145;derived the most considerable Advantages, from the <i>Observations</i> which he made on the Works of <i>Van Dyck</i>&#146;  (Graham, 375&#150;6). His earliest signed miniature, <i>c</i>.1635, is a portrait of Van Dyck's mistress Margaret Lemon, now in the Institut N&eacute;erlandais, Paris.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandmarriage"></a>Early years and marriage</h2>By 1634 the Hoskins household had moved to Bedford Street, in the fashionable new development of Covent Garden, where Cooper wrote out for the king's physician, Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne, who attended Hoskins as his doctor and commissioned his portrait from him, &#145;tout le secret de lenluminure&#146;  (Edmond, &#145;Limners and picturemakers&#146;, 100&#150;01). About 1635 Cooper's hand is evident in miniatures presented as the work of his uncle (see portraits of the earl of Dorset and the earl of Holland in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London) but his own signed <i>&#339;uvre</i> does not begin until 1642; early biographers state that he &#145;spent several years of his life abroad&#146;  (Graham, 375&#150;6). He was widely accomplished. Samuel Pepys recorded (on 10 July 1668) that he spoke French, and Richard Graham that &#145;he was reckon'd one of the best <i>Lutenists</i> &hellip; in his Time&#146;  (ibid.). By 1642 he was certainly in England, living in King Street, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>In 1642 Cooper married Christiana (1623&#150;1693), daughter of William Turner of Towthorpe, near York, and of his wife, Thomasina. Christiana had a sister, Edith (<i>b</i>. 1643), who became the mother of the poet Alexander Pope. In 1650 Cooper moved with his wife to one of the most substantial houses in Henrietta Street, also in Covent Garden, and lived there until his death. There were no children of the marriage.<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>Through his uncle Samuel Cooper was introduced from the start to the royal and courtly clientele of miniature painting, but never worked under his own name for Charles I, since Charles and his court left London for Oxford about the time that Cooper arrived. By the mid-1640s he was adapting himself and his style successfully to suit the prevailing conditions of patronage in London during the civil wars and interregnum, building a reputation for good likenesses, brilliant execution, and great personal charm. His &#145;parliamentary&#146; output&#151;portraits of men in armour usually against a dark background, and women whose <i>tenue</i> remained relatively unaffected by the circumstances of war&#151;culminated in the paintings of Oliver Cromwell in the early 1650s: &#145;Mr Cooper. the painter &hellip; desires you to excuse him one month longer, as he has some work to finish for Lord General Cromwell and his family&#146;, wrote Miles Woodshaw to Lord Conway on 7 November 1650  (Long, 85). Cooper seems to have taken various likenesses of Cromwell for various purposes, including formal portraiture, for which he made the <i>ad vivum</i> sketch now in the collection of the duke of Buccleuch and on which Lely may have relied for the surviving oil painting (Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery). There are also images made apparently for use on medals or coins, a good example of which is an <i>ad vivum</i> profile in the National Portrait Gallery. Claimed likenesses of other members of the Cromwell family, including the sons Richard and Henry, are very doubtful but there is a miniature by Cooper, descended from the Claypoles, traditionally identified as Elizabeth Claypole, Cromwell's younger and favourite daughter, dated 1653, in the collection of the duke of Buccleuch, which has been considered by the National Portrait Gallery to provide authority for other possible images of Elizabeth. These might include the small, bright, and highly finished miniatures by Cooper&#151;also of the mid-1650s&#151;one of which was given by Lord Lee of Fareham to the Chequers Trust, and the other, finer version of which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum  (Murdoch, cat. no. 74). It is particularly interesting that these miniatures, if they are correctly identified, suggest the extent to which the protector's family (but not he) adopted after 1653 a personal style similar to that of the French royal family and court, where enamel portraits, set in expensive boxes or personal jewels, provided a fashionable means of courtly self-presentation. Arguably, however, for the historian of English visual culture in the revolutionary years it is portraits such as the <span class="italic">Sir William Palmer</span> of 1657 (V&amp;A), apparently alluding to Rembrandt in their colouring, that show most vividly Cooper's probing and intelligent engagement with the individuality of his sitters as distinct from their class or official status. A similar ability to characterize as well as portray is occasionally evident in the work of other contemporary English artists such as William Dobson (<i>bap</i>. 1611, <i>d</i>. 1646). It shows a tendency in the development of English painting and in the understanding of human nature that is surely related to the interest in inductive study of appearances and symptoms characteristic of English seventeenth-century thinking about ways of truly knowing a subject.<br>
<br>Soon after the Restoration, however, Charles II sat to Cooper for a new likeness used for the production of numerous finished miniatures, most of which were not finished to Cooper's normal high standard, which suggests that Cooper was again so pressed with business that the replication of the new king's image required studio assistance. Of these official portraits the best and largest is probably that of the king in Garter robes at Goodwood House, Sussex. The king also sat to Cooper for a profile for the new coinage. John Evelyn, the diarist and art connoisseur, records for 10 January 1662:<blockquote>Being call'd to his Majesty's closet when Mr. Cooper, the rare limner, was crayoning of the King's face and head, to make the stamps by, for the new mill'd money now contriving, I had the honour to hold the candle whilst it was doing, he choosing the night and candle-light for the better finding out the shadows. During this his Majesty discours'd with me on several things relating to painting and graving. (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.309&#150;10)</blockquote>Drawings in red and black chalk, now in the Royal Collection, are probably results of this sitting. Such an emphatic chiaroscuro was necessary in designs intended for the low-relief die-maker but normally Cooper painted in the full light of his studio. His portrait of James, duke of York, of 1661 (V&amp;A) is an excellent example of the development in his orthodox miniature portraiture at this period. It is bright and direct in its lighting, and subtly enriched in its representation of the sitter's complexion; it shows also the enlargement of the oval to nearly 3&frac12; inches, which became increasingly the norm for miniatures until the mid-eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Cooper's professional pre-eminence was confirmed by his appointment as king's limner in 1663. Such was his charm and perceived eminence that his clients tended to become his friends and willing advocates. His circle of acquaintance seems to have included most of the intellectual and artistic &eacute;lite of the period; Richard Graham recorded that he was known to &#145;the greatest Men of <i>France</i>, <i>Holland</i>, and his <i>own country</i>, and by his <i>Works</i> more universally known in all the parts of <i>Christendom</i>&#146;  (Graham, 376). When Grand Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany sat to him in 1669 Cooper was described in the official journal of the visit as &#145;un piccinetto tutto spirito e cortesia. E ancor egli assai ricco, e in casa non sta meno honorabilmente di Lelley, lavora sopra un tavolino coperto di velluto&#146; (&#145;a tiny man, all spirit and courtesy, very well-off and not less honourably set up in his house than Lely, and working on a table covered in velvet&#146;; Crino, 148). The style in which Lely lived was famous. Pepys, as well as Evelyn, watched Cooper at work, the experience of seeing the genius in action being highly valued. Charles Beale, another diarist, recorded his death: &#145;Sunday, May 5 1672, Mr Samuel Cooper, the most famous limner in the world for a face, died&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note Books</span>, 4.169).<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Cooper died thus at the height of his powers, busy with commissions from the king and the duke of York, in his fine house on Henrietta Street. Interestingly he may have converted to Roman Catholicism, for he chose not to be buried in his own parish but in the church of St Pancras, in which many converts were buried at this time. His tomb bears the initials of the pre-Reformation monumental inscription &#145;Cuius animae propricietur deus&#146;  (Edmond, &#145;Samuel Cooper&#146;, 83&#150;5). It also states his age at death as sixty-four.<br>
<br>As a miniaturist Cooper was the pioneer of a method of painting the human face using a firm hatching stroke applied with the tip of the brush in red and brown, which he developed evidently while still working within the orbit of his uncle John Hoskins. The method requires considerable assurance of hand and is particularly well fitted for a draughtsman capable of seizing a sitter's likeness rapidly. In contrast to the delicate stipples of the earlier tradition of Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver the hatching style is demonstrative and painterly; its stylistic relationship to the &#145;new&#146; portraiture of Mytens and Van Dyck has often been observed. Other elements of the composition, such as architectural or landscape backgrounds, are often painted with an almost aggressive or careless breadth. Examples of early exercises in this style are the portrait of the earl of Holland against a stormy sky (Ham House, Richmond, Surrey) and that of the fourth earl of Dorset, after Van Dyck (V&amp;A), which bears the Hoskins monogram but is surely by the young Cooper. The somewhat harsh painterly style of the late 1630s becomes very disciplined in the 1640s, the hatching in the face firm and clear, and subordinated to the need to produce a good characteristic likeness. The backgrounds are neatly painted, often plain dark brown with perhaps a flush of light reflected from the studio window behind the sitter's left shoulder. Sometimes the background is divided, as though the sitter is posed against a window or door to the outside world. This phase, during which the standard Cooper signature is the separate initials SC divided by a colon, gives way progressively to an interest in fine finish, with the brush strokes disappearing into a smooth, illusionistic surface, and, in 1653, a new signature: a loose monogram of the conjoined initials, usually with a date, appears for the first time.<br>
<br>By the early 1650s Cooper was responding to the French developments in fine enamel portraiture, sometimes reducing the size of his ovals and increasingly aiming at a fine, &#145;invisible&#146; <i>facture</i>, as in the portraits said to be of Elizabeth Claypole. Alongside these, however, there seem to be signs of a division in his <i>&#339;uvre</i> between the miniatures, which are made according to the rigorous professional discipline of the sittings, and his sketches or graphic work, in which, in common with other draughtsmen of the time, he allowed an interest in brilliant execution to be predominant. They are probably opportunistic or alternative views of sitters, quickly executed as the artist tried his subject in different positions. Many such &#145;unfinished&#146; works were extant in his studio at his death, variously interpreted as either awaiting the finishing touches or as pattern likenesses, preparatory to the multiplication of finished works. More probably, however, they were always intended to be autonomous, a different kind of art recording the direct experience of the studio, and contrasting with the necessary formality of the finished miniatures.<br>
<br>In the finished miniatures of the 1660s, as the standard size of the oval was increased to some 3&frac12; inches and large, rectangular, &#145;cabinet&#146; miniatures were demanded by the most important sitters, other ways of maintaining the illusionistic surface had to be developed. The brush strokes accordingly begin to be blended together, with considerable amounts of gouache and with a final glaze of red in the cheeks, to create an effect of vividness that sometimes startled contemporaries: &#145;I must confess I do think the colouring of the flesh to be a little forced&#146;, wrote Samuel Pepys, whose eye would have been conditioned by twenty years of looking at the sober, &#145;sad-coloured&#146; portraiture of the interregnum  (Pepys, 136). Unfortunately, however, except in the private collection at Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire, few unfaded Cooper miniatures of any period now survive.<br>
<br>For all aspects of his <i>&#339;uvre</i> a full representation of Cooper's stylistic range, including an interesting group of the &#145;unfinished&#146; works deriving ultimately from the estate of his widow, may be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The most brilliant of the surviving &#145;sketches&#146;&#151;of sitters who had been of importance to the king&#151;were, however, acquired from Christiana Cooper by Charles II in June 1673, when Christiana was granted a pension of &pound;200 a year. They remain in the Royal Collection and include portraits of two royal mistresses&#151;Barbara Villiers, duchess of Cleveland, and Frances Stuart, duchess of Richmond&#151;of extraordinary delicacy in representing the different formal properties of the beauty exemplified by these famous women. Cooper's ability thus to analyse, even when the imperatives of flattery might seem to be at their sharpest, extends to the contrasting images of James Scott, duke of Monmouth (equally famous for his personal beauty), and George Monck, duke of Albemarle, the subtle soldier&#150;politician, his gaze resting on something just to the artist's right. Unlike the sober portraiture of the 1640s and 1650s these are not character studies but are more neutral, more a matter of vision and record. Already in the seventeenth century they were understood as the raw material of history, compiled first-hand by an observer of rare sensitivity. Thomas Carlyle considered that <i>ad vivum</i> portraits were among the most valuable of historical documents, and in all these images the fortunes of those caught up in the great events of the seventeenth century become indeed more accessible to the imagination.<br>
<br>The whole group of unfinished miniatures, presumably including those acquired for the king, was seen soon after Cooper's death by the London agent of Grand Duke Cosimo III, who had been so impressed by the artist's genius and style in 1669 and who persisted in trying to acquire examples of his work until 1683. Cooper's widow, however, did not really need to sell, and the remaining miniatures &#145;which I shall have by me att the tyme of my decease&#146; were bequeathed by her to John Hoskins, the son of the miniaturist and evidently a miniaturist himself  (Edmond, &#145;Limners and picturemakers&#146;, 111&#150;12). Some of them, possibly left in the Henrietta Street house at Christiana's death (24 August 1693), passed to the house's next inhabitant, the goldsmith Michael Rosse, husband of the miniaturist Susannah-Penelope Rosse (daughter of the miniaturist Richard Gibson), where they continued to exercise influence over both the practice and the connoisseurship of art in England. (An incomplete list of those included in the sale of Michael Rosse's collection, 2 April 1723, is printed in D. Foskett, <span class="italic">Samuel Cooper</span>, 1974, 100&#150;06.)<br>
<br>Like his predecessors Peter Oliver and John Hoskins and many contemporaries Cooper worked also in &#145;crayon&#146;, as Evelyn called it&#151;&#145;dry colour&#146; in Edward Norgate's vocabulary, or &#145;pastel&#146;, as it is now normally known. A drawing in this fragile medium, once believed to be a self-portrait, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Its quality, perhaps due to retouching, is unimpressive and it is probably not by Cooper but may be a portrait of him in the late 1650s by his cousin &#145;Jack's son&#146;, the younger Hoskins. The black chalk drawing of Thomas Alcock in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, to which could perhaps be added that of Charles II in the Royal Collection and a famous study of a dead baby from a group of Hoskins family portraits that survive in the Harford Collection (exhibited at the Cooper exhibition, National Portrait Gallery, 1974, nos. 136&#150;9), are on the other hand very beautiful and suggest that, had any genuine Cooper pastels survived in comparable condition, they also would be of beautiful quality.<br>
<br>Apart from the pastel in the Victoria and Albert Museum the only plausible image of Cooper is the miniature in the Royal Collection, recently rehabilitated as a self-portrait by Graham Reynolds on the grounds of its inscriptions, its long traditional identification, and its iconography  (Reynolds, <span class="italic">Miniatures</span>, no. 106, pp. 129&#150;30). If Reynolds is right it would show Cooper in February 1645, aged about thirty-seven, an exceptionally attractive man with curly dark brown hair and vivid brown eyes, wearing a crisply laundered lace collar over an embroidered silk coat of discreet but luxurious quality. It helps to substantiate his reputation for charm and suggests an astonishing degree of economic self-confidence in a young man who was just beginning to establish himself in a luxury trade against a background of civil war and the puritan critique of conspicuous urban consumption.<br>
