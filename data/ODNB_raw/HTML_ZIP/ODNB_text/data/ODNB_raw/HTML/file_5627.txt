<span class="headword">Clerke,  Francis</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1564&#150;1594), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and jurist</span>, whose origins are unknown, spent most of his professional career as a proctor in the courts of the archbishop of Canterbury in London and also in the admiralty courts. In a preface to a work written in the 1590s, he made known that he had been active in the court of arches during the previous thirty-six years. As was customary, he would first have spent some years in the equivalent of pupillage, since the contemporary records of the courts show his formal admission as a proctor in 1564. In 1583 a Francis Clerke was admitted to Gray's Inn; it was not unusual for a civil lawyer to be so welcomed by the common lawyers. If this is the same person, he came from Stevenage. It has also been suggested that he was related to Bartholomew Clerke (<i>d</i>. 1590), dean of the court of arches, but again the possibility rests only on the coincidence in profession and name. Unlike advocates, proctors commonly entered practice after leaving university without having taken a degree or even without having attended a university at all, and one of these was evidently the path Clerke took. However, he supplicated for, and received, the BCL from Oxford in 1594, professedly so that he could lay claim to that distinction on the title-page of his soon to be published book, the earliest copies of which, though all in manuscript, date from the mid-1590s.<br>
<br>Most of what can be known about Clerke must be derived from his two works, which were used by practitioners as long as the courts about which he wrote flourished. Lord Hardwicke later described him as &#145;an author of undoubted credit&#146;  (<i>Sir Henry Blount's case</i>). Clerke's close familiarity with the courts and his stated goal of helping practising civil lawyers overcome the limitations of academic training lend credence to the description. The longer of his works, <span class="italic">Praxis in curiis ecclesiasticis</span>, was published after Clerke's death, in Dublin in 1666, and in London in 1684. However, it circulated widely in manuscript beforehand, and many manuscript copies have survived in local and diocesan archives&#151;testimony to its utility in understanding the procedure employed in all English ecclesiastical courts. The Latin is unvarnished, and substantive law is related to its discussion of procedure. Unfortunately, the long gestation period of a printed edition led to the introduction of errors, and no satisfactory edition has ever been produced. It was largely overtaken by Henry Conset's <span class="italic">Practice of the Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Courts</span> (1684), which itself relied heavily on Clerke's work.<br>
<br>Many similar works were written during this period by continental jurists. They combined descriptions of the special features of particular courts with more general treatments of procedural law in the <i>ius commune</i>. Typically, they moved through the steps in litigation, from citation to sentence and appeal. Clerke followed that model but, unlike most continental writers, he provided no citations to the works of learned jurists. Many manuscript copies carry marginalia, made later by the proctors and advocates who did provide them.<br>
<br>Clerke's second and shorter work, <span class="italic">Praxis curie admiralitatis Angliae</span>, is similar in approach to the first. The admiralty courts used the same basic procedure as the church's courts, but they varied it, as for example in allowing <i>in rem</i> attachments of vessels appropriate to general maritime law. This work enjoyed a longer currency, perhaps because of a lack of effective competition. The first edition, published in London in 1667, was reprinted in 1679. Other editions, some produced with facing translations, appeared in 1722, 1743, 1798, and 1829, the second of these edited by Francis Hargrave. John Elihu Hall translated the text and added American notes in a version published in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1809. No trace of Clerke's will has survived, and even the date of his death is unknown.<br>
