<span class="headword">Waugh <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Lotherington]</span>,  Dorothy</span>  (<em>c.</em>1636&#150;1666?), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was probably born in Hutton, Westmorland; though further details of her parentage are unknown, her sister, Jane Waugh (later Whitehead), was also a Friend.<br>
<br>Dorothy Waugh converted to Quakerism in the early 1650s, and she was one of the &#145;valiant sixty&#146; whose efforts ensured that the movement quickly achieved a national and international profile. For Waugh, whose exposure to the Quaker message probably came when she was a maid at the house of another Friend, John Camm, the call to service involved ministering campaigns both at home and abroad, and not infrequently resulted in spells of imprisonment. A term in Kendal prison in 1653 was followed later by another four months' detention in Norwich in 1654&#151;but neither sentence deterred Waugh. She subsequently published the Quaker message in Buckinghamshire (1655), Cornwall (1655), Carlisle (1655), Reading (1656), and, on two separate occasions, on ministering journeys to New England (1656, 1657). In Carlisle during Michaelmas 1655 Waugh preached against the citizenry's &#145;deceit &amp; ungodly practices&#146; to the consternation of the town's mayor who, believing that Waugh's incendiary presence might &#145;spoile a whole Cittie&#146;, imprisoned Waugh and, furthermore, placed her head in a scold's bridle  (Waugh, 29&#150;30).<br>
<br>The penalties for preaching in New England were equally harsh: Waugh first suffered imprisonment and expulsion from the colony, sharing the common fate of seven other Quakers who had ventured into Boston in July 1656. Several of the party, among them Waugh, defied the rules of transportation, returning once more to the colony in the summer of 1657; this time, the courageous Quaker travelled from Boston to Salem with another woman, Sarah Gibbons, defying the harsh New England weather as much as the authorities. She and her female companion were commended in contemporary accounts for enduring &#145;storms and tempests &hellip; frost and snow&#146; in order to &#145;accomplish the will and work of God&#146;  (Norton, 69). On returning once more to Boston in February 1659, however, the two women were imprisoned and later whipped for preaching. According to accounts, the women praised God even while the lashes were laid on.<br>
<br>Waugh's marriage to the Quaker William Lotherington (<i>d</i>. 1674?) of Whitby probably occurred around the time of her return from New England, where she had become a vocal advocate of marital celibacy. She probably rescinded her public testimony in favour of the domestic life from this point onwards; at least, she appears no longer to figure in the compendium of Quaker sufferings compiled by the eighteenth-century martyrologist William Besse. If she and William settled in Whitby, Yorkshire, to become members of the Pickering meeting, as seems likely, then it was two of their children, Hannah and Benjamin, who died there in 1664. Dorothy herself probably died on 9 December 1666, in Whitby, though both the cause of death and her place of burial are unknown. Her husband probably died in their home town on 1 March 1674.<br>
<br>Dorothy Waugh's place in Quaker history is as a preacher and a writer, whose courage spreading the Quaker message secured her significance as one of the first &#145;publishers of truth&#146;. Though she was a literate woman, Waugh's only published account of her travels relates to her treatment in Carlisle, while her testimony is one of the few records surviving from the seventeenth century describing firsthand the constraints of a scold's bridle.<br>
