<span class="headword">Gaskell,  Holbrook</span>  (1813&#150;1909), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 5 March 1813 in Wavertree, near Liverpool, the eldest son (there was also at least one daughter) of Roger Gaskell, manager of the commercial branch of a Warrington sailcloth firm, and his wife and cousin, Anne Hunter. Educated at a private school in Norton near Sheffield, Gaskell was apprenticed as a clerk to Yates and Cox, Liverpool iron merchants and nail makers, in 1827. In 1836 he joined James Nasmyth as a partner with responsibility for commercial and financial operations at the Bridgewater foundry at Patricroft near Manchester. On 28 December 1841 Gaskell married Frances Ann, daughter of Henry Bellhouse, of Victoria Park, Greenhayes, Manchester. They had three sons and three daughters. All three sons became partners in the family firm. A grandson, also Holbrook Gaskell (1878&#150;1951), a director of ICI, was knighted in 1942. The physiologist Walter Holbrook Gaskell was his nephew.<br>
<br>Gaskell's business acumen placed Nasmyth, Gaskell &amp; Co. among the leading engineering firms in Britain, but in June 1850 ill health forced him to retire. In June 1855, his health restored, he entered into a second partnership, this time with Henry Deacon, industrial chemist and former apprentice of Nasmyth. At first Gaskell supported Deacon's plans to manufacture alkali by the new Solvay process, but later persuaded him for financial reasons to employ the older Leblanc method. In the 1860s Gaskell, Deacon &amp; Co. was among the largest and most successful chemical works in Widnes, owing to Gaskell's commercial management and Deacon's method of recovering chlorine for bleaching powder manufacture. Gaskell was actively involved with the firm until the 1870s, after which he remained a director until November 1890, when it was absorbed into the United Alkali Company. He was then appointed to a vice-presidency in recognition of his services to the chemical industry.<br>
<br>Gaskell had wide interests in the north-west. Inspired by a sense of private and public duty, he served as a magistrate in Widnes for many years. In politics he was an active liberal, and after 1886, Liberal Unionist, a member of the Liverpool Reform Club, and a supporter of radical causes, including the extension of the franchise. Interested in education, he donated nearly &pound;6000 towards the endowment of a chair of botany and the provision of chemistry laboratories at University College, Liverpool. He presented Widnes with public baths in 1889 and supported convalescent homes in Heswall and Southport. He was a proprietor of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily and Weekly Post and Echo</span> and became chairman when the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> and <span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span> amalgamated in 1904. An art connoisseur, Gaskell owned one of the finest collections of paintings in the north of England, including works by J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. The collection was loaned to the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, in 1885. He died at his home, Woolton Wood, Much Woolton, Lancashire, on 8 March 1909.<br>
