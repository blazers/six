<span class="headword">Finlay,  (William) Ian Robertson</span>  (1906&#150;1995), <span class="occ">museum director and art historian</span>, was born at Auckland, New Zealand, on 2 December 1906, the son of William Walker Robertson Finlay (1875&#150;1961), stationer and artist, and his wife, Annie Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Somerville (1875&#150;1951). Within six weeks of his birth, his parents, who were Scottish, returned to Edinburgh, which became Finlay's home for the rest of his life. From 1915 to 1924 he attended the Edinburgh Academy but he did not take the university entrance examination until 1926. He entered the University of Edinburgh in that year and graduated with honours in history in 1930. In 1928 he was joint winner of the Cousin prize in fine art, his major subject. In 1932 he became an assistant keeper in the department of art and ethnography of the Royal Scottish Museum, then administered by the Scottish education department. He was appointed keeper of the department in 1955 and director of the museum in 1961, retiring in 1971. During the Second World War he was seconded to the Ministry of Information, and from 1942 to 1944 he was the ministry's deputy regional officer for Scotland. He contributed a number of the BBC's wartime <span class="italic">Sunday Postscripts</span>, and became a frequent broadcaster.<br>
<br>Gold and silverware were Finlay's chief interest, and he enhanced the museum's collections significantly. A purchase which gave him particular pleasure was the French seventeenth-century Lennoxlove toilet-service, which he regarded as perhaps the finest thing of its kind in existence. His book <span class="italic">Scottish Gold and Silver Work</span> (1956), revised by H. Steuart Fotheringham (1991), remains the standard text in this field. He became a freeman of the City of London in 1949 and liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1951.<br>
<br>In 1960 Finlay visited American museums as a guest of the American state department. On becoming director in the following year, he was able to act on the insights he had gained there, as well as on his own ideas for the future of the museum. He was anxious to provide services to the public and so make the museum a more welcoming place. The refurbishment of the Victorian building by the Property Services Agency gave him the opportunity to plan for public services as well as new presentations by the museum's four curatorial departments. Having inherited a new lecture theatre, he started a programme of public lectures by eminent scholars which made a valuable addition to Edinburgh's cultural life. A tea-room was created. Posts in education, public relations, and design were established, which inaugurated work that later expanded greatly. The Friends of the Royal Scottish Museum, then a new idea in Scotland, was started under his guidance. Throughout his museum career he was responsible for temporary exhibitions of quality and influence which were enhanced by the provision of a new temporary exhibition hall during his directorship. Many were associated with the Edinburgh international festival, and some went on to other venues. Of particular significance was &#145;Byzantine Art&#146; (1958), arranged by David and Tamara Talbot Rice, which showed objects from behind the Iron Curtain for the first time in the West since the Second World War.<br>
<br>Finlay's concern for the arts was not confined to the museum. For eight years (1953&#150;61) he was secretary of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland. He maintained active links with the Arts Council and was vice-chairman of the Scottish Arts Council in 1967. From 1968 to 1971 he served on the Edinburgh festival council, and he was a member of the <i>conseil de direction</i> of the <span class="italic">Gazette des Beaux Arts</span>. He was made a CBE in 1965, and in 1971 was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy on his appointment as its tenth professor of antiquities.<br>
<br>Writing was important to Finlay and, on leaving school, his freelance articles began to appear in the Scottish press. He contributed to journals in this country and abroad, but preferred to communicate through books. His love of Scotland's history, arts, and landscape inspired eighteen lucid and informative books for adults and children. After retiring from the museum he travelled in Europe pursuing his interest in Celtic art, which led to his <span class="italic">Celtic Art: an Introduction</span> (1973) and his last work, <span class="italic">Columba</span> (1979; new edn 1990).<br>
<br>Finlay was a well-known figure in the Scottish arts world. Tall, thin, bespectacled, and somewhat reserved, he was a man of charm and distinction. He remained young at heart, his youthful appearance belying his years. He was attractive to younger people because he was a good listener and encouraged the enthusiasms of others. Occasional bursts of anger betrayed his strength of purpose, particularly when his objectives were frustrated by small-mindedness. He had two sons and one daughter with his wife, Mary Scott (1908&#150;1999), daughter of William Henderson Pringle, barrister, of Lincoln's Inn, whom he married on 2 September 1933. The garden of their home at Currie Riggs, Balerno, Midlothian, was a challenge and a joy to him. Not mechanically minded, he enjoyed telling of his motoring adventures. Benighted in an undertaker's store near Glasgow, he was less concerned by his car than intrigued by the macabre transactions going on around him. The power-saw which he requested on his retirement was therefore given with misgivings. He died at Belgrave Lodge, Edinburgh, of heart failure, on 10 December 1995, and was cremated on 16 December at Mortonhall crematorium. He was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
