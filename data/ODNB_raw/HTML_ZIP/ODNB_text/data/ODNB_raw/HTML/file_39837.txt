<span class="headword">Laski,  Marghanita <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Esther Pearl]</span></span>  (1915&#150;1988), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born in Maida Vale, London on 24 October 1915, the eldest child (she had one sister, two brothers, and an adopted brother and sister) of Neville Jonas Laski, barrister (later a crown court judge), and his wife, Seraphina Gaster. Her father called her Marghanita (an affectionate adaptation of the Aramaic word for &#145;pearl&#146;) when she was small and she later adopted it herself. She was educated at Ladybarn House School in Manchester, at St Paul's Girls' School, London, and at Somerville College, Oxford, where she read English language and literature, giving as much time as the syllabus allowed to Old English and Middle English. She obtained a third-class degree in 1936. She also found time at Oxford for socializing and playing croquet and bridge. It was at Oxford that she met John Eldred Howard, whom she married in 1937; he became a publisher and was the founder of the Cresset Press. He was the son of John Howard, stockbroker and farmer. They lived in Oxford during the Second World War, and about 1948 moved to Capo di Monte, a picturesque house on the edge of Hampstead Heath, where they remained for the rest of their lives. About 1965 they acquired a holiday house in the south of France, and it was there that a great deal of her book reviewing and her reading for the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> was done.<br>
<br>A primary influence on Laski's early life in Manchester was her maternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33351/', "Moses Gaster (1856&#150;1939)")</script>, scholar and chief rabbi of Sephardi Jews in England, 1887&#150;1918, and she found his younger children, her near contemporaries, an intellectually stimulating group. She rarely spoke about her uncle Harold Laski, the political theorist, and it can be assumed that he played little part in shaping her beliefs. In view of the enduring influence of Moses Gaster it is a mark of Marghanita Laski's true independence of mind that, while remaining proud of her Jewishness, she renounced her faith even before she went up to Oxford and declared herself to be an atheist.<br>
<br>Marghanita Laski's first novel, <span class="italic">Love on the Supertax</span>, was published in 1944, and this was followed by numerous other works (novels unless otherwise stated), including <span class="italic">The Patchwork Book</span> (an anthology, 1946); <span class="italic">To Bed with Grand Music</span> (written under the pseudonym Sarah Russell, 1946); <span class="italic">Stories of Adventure</span> (which she edited, 1946); <span class="italic">Victorian Tales</span> (also as editor, 1947); <span class="italic">Tory Heaven</span> (1948); <span class="italic">Little Boy Lost</span> (1949); <span class="italic">The Village</span> (1952); <span class="italic">The Victorian Chaise-Longue</span> (1953); and <span class="italic">The Offshore Island</span> (a play, 1959). The film rights of <span class="italic">Little Boy Lost</span> were sold to John Mills, and she was furious and hurt when he turned it into a musical starring Bing Crosby (1953).<br>
<br>In the 1960s Laski turned away from the writing of fiction, and a string of thoughtful and literary works followed, including <span class="italic">Ecstasy</span> (1961), an ambitious book subtitled: <span class="italic">A Study of some Secular and Religious Experiences</span>; a set of essays on the Victorian novelist Charlotte M. Yonge (with E. G. Battiscombe, 1965); and a series of studies of the work of Jane Austen (1969), George Eliot (1973), and Rudyard Kipling (1974). She also broadcast widely acclaimed radio programmes on the life and work of Kipling (1973, 1983).<br>
<br>To the general public Laski was best-known as a broadcaster. &#145;Her clear, immediately recognisable voice with a slight touch of petulance or arrogance always there, was heard in programmes such as <span class="italic">Any Questions?</span>, <span class="italic">The Brains Trust</span>, and <span class="italic">The Critics</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Feb 1988) [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>]. She also enjoyed speaking from pulpits, and her sermons were a demonstration of her profound and continuing interest in religion.<br>
<br>Laski gave much time and energy from 1974 onwards to the committee of inquiry into the future of broadcasting (1974&#150;7, chaired by Lord Annan); and to the Arts Council (from 1979), serving as its vice-chairman (1982&#150;6) and also as chairman of its literature advisory panel (1980&#150;84).<br>
<br>Laski's extraordinary contribution as a voluntary reader for the supplement to the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> was among her noblest deeds. From 1958 until the publication of the final volume in 1986 she supplied some 250,000 illustrative examples to the project, all copied out in her own hand. For this purpose she dredged numerous bulky Edwardian sales catalogues for the names of domestic articles, she read much of the crime fiction published in the twentieth century, and she scoured the whole rich literary world of twentieth-century (and some older) books and magazines for their unregistered vocabulary.<br>
<br>At Oxford and throughout her life Laski was renowned for her beauty, her forceful personality, and her obsession with religious and secular beliefs. She died in the Royal Brompton Hospital from a smoking-related lung problem on 6 February 1988; her husband died in 1992. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
