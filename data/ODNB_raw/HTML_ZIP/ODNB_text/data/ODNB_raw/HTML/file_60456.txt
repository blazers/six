<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Eddington,  Paul Clark</span>  (1927&#150;1995), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 18 June 1927 at 174 Sutherland Avenue, Paddington, London, the son of Albert Clark Eddington, a decorative artist, and his wife, Frances Clark Eddington, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frances Mary Roberts. He was brought up in St John's Wood, London. His father, a Quaker related to the Quaker Clark family of Somerset shoemakers, was an addictive gambler who had emotional problems after serving in the trenches in the First World War. His mother, a Roman Catholic, was a radical thinker and hostess to artists and intellectuals. Eddington was brought up as a Catholic and was educated at the Holy Child Convent, Cavendish Square, London, but when his parents' marriage ended his mother sent him to board at the Friends' school at Sibford Ferris, Oxfordshire. He remained a Quaker for the rest of his life. Leaving school at seventeen with no ambition but to do something artistic, he became a window dresser at a Birmingham store and an amateur actor. In 1944 he joined the Entertainments National Service Association at the garrison theatre, Colchester, but he acted only briefly for the troops before it was discovered that he was a registered conscientious objector and he was dismissed. After the war he spent over ten years at the repertory theatres in Birmingham, Sheffield, and Ipswich, with a year at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1951. On 28 April 1952 he married (Vida) Patricia Scott (<i>b</i>. 1929/30), an actress whom he had met in the wings at Sheffield repertory theatre. She was the daughter of Jonathan Joseph Scott, a police officer. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>After several years in television Eddington made his West End d&eacute;but as the Rabbi in <span class="italic">The Tenth Man</span> (1961). He joined the Bristol Old Vic as leading man in 1962. In transfers to London he was seen as Prince Andrei in <span class="italic">War and Peace</span> (Old Vic and Phoenix, 1962&#150;3), a sexually obliging psychiatrist in Iris Murdoch's <span class="italic">A Severed Head</span> (Criterion, 1963; New York, 1964), and Benjamin Disraeli in <span class="italic">A Portrait of the Queen</span> (Vaudeville, 1965). Other roles at Bristol included Ibsen's Brand, Brutus in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Henry II in Anouilh's <span class="italic">Becket</span>, Parolles in <span class="italic">All's Well that Ends Well</span>, and Biedermann in Frisch's <span class="italic">The Fire Raisers</span>.<br>
<br>Still unambitious by nature but with a growing family to support, Eddington&#151;who had long been familiar with the labour exchange&#151;once considered giving up the theatre for a job as salesman with an oil company, but in 1966, as Captain Doleful in the musical comedy <span class="italic">Jorrocks</span> (New), he won the Clarence Derwent award as the season's best supporting actor. This led to another West End musical comedy, but it was Alan Bennett's musical satire <span class="italic">Forty Years On</span> (Apollo, 1968) that brought better luck. As a nervous young housemaster trying to impress John Gielgud's haughty headmaster, Eddington learned not only the technical value of keeping still on stage but he also learned how much he had in common with Gielgud: once, in their mutual desire not to upstage the other, the two actors nearly fell into the orchestra pit. It was a feature of Eddington's later career that he thrived in some of Gielgud's finest roles. After the headmaster in a revival of <span class="italic">Forty Years On</span> (Chichester and Haymarket, 1984), Eddington shone as Spooner in Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">No Man's Land</span> (Almeida and Comedy, 1993), though he did not smoke, as Gielgud had in imitation of W. H. Auden, on whom the part was based. Eddington also proved an affecting Harry in David Storey's <span class="italic">Home</span> (Wyndham's, 1995). Although he wanted to cover his baldness, caused by medical treatment for a skin disease, with a straw hat, the author persuaded him not to. It was his last stage performance.<br>
<br>It was, however, on television that Eddington achieved renown for his light touch and expert sense of understated comedy. He was the henpecked husband of Penelope Keith's snobbish Margo in <span class="italic">The Good Life</span> (1975&#150;9), and a wily but na&iuml;ve Jim Hacker MP in <span class="italic">Yes, Minister</span> and its sequel, <span class="italic">Yes, Prime Minister</span>, which ran through the 1980s. It was while watching Alan Ayckbourn's suburban comedy <span class="italic">Absurd Person Singular</span> (Criterion and Vaudeville, 1974), that a television producer took a shine to Eddington's diffident style, with his slight stoop, wary eyes, and drawn cheeks. Eddington was at heart a more serious-minded actor than his light touch on television might indicate; at this time he had just played James Tyrone in <span class="italic">Long Day's Journey into Night</span> and Osborne in <span class="italic">Journey's End</span> for the Bristol Old Vic, and whenever he could he evaded typecasting with surprising success. As the cruel and drooling husband George in Edward Albee's <span class="italic">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</span> (National, 1981) and as the pathetic old classics master in Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">The Browning Version</span> (Theatre Royal, Bristol, and Royalty, London, 1984), Eddington's command of the stage was emotionally complex and deep. His moral philosopher in Tom Stoppard's <span class="italic">Jumpers</span> (Aldwych, 1985), his exuberant Sir Hartley Courtly in Boucicault's <span class="italic">London Assurance</span> (Chichester, 1989), and his Orgon in Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span> (Playhouse, 1991) were further evidence of his power, range, and technique.<br>
<br>Eddington's role as the embattled Jim Hacker MP (and later as prime minister) brought him fame, and sometimes also embarrassment. He was happy to have been one of the few non-politicians to address Westminster's lobby correspondents&#151;he was appointed CBE in 1987&#151;but he could only smile wrily at the frequency with which the red carpet was rolled out for him on his travels, as if he had political influence: breakfast with the prime minister of Norway and an invitation to address a general election rally in Australia were only two examples. While the party allegiance of the character Hacker was never proclaimed, he was assumed to be right-wing, whereas Eddington himself belonged to the left. When he was asked by 10 Downing Street to pose for publicity pictures with the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, he replied: &#145;To put it bluntly, she needs us more than we need her&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Nov 1995). As a governor of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre trust, Eddington declared that he would never act there again until the company declined a tobacco company's grants. A former campaigner against nuclear arms and the chairman of the International Committee for Artists' Freedom&#151;which raised funds for dissident theatre groups&#151;Eddington also strove in vain for the admission of women as members of the Garrick Club.<br>
<br>During his illness, which was not identified until the mid-1980s as a form of skin cancer, mycosis fungoides, Eddington resolved that his health should not interfere with his acting. His Justice Shallow in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> for BBC television was shown shortly before he died in London on 4 November 1995. His memoirs, <span class="italic">So Far, so Good</span>, were published the previous month. His wife and four children survived him.<br>
