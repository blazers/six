<span class="headword">Gray,  (Thomas) Cecil</span>  (1913&#150;2008), <span class="occ">anaesthetist</span>, was born on 11 March 1913 at the Clock public house, 31 London Road, Liverpool, of which his father Thomas Gray was the landlord. His mother, Ethel Gray, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Unwin, had been married before, to the Macclesfield silk manufacturer Ernest Abraham, and widowed with three children. Cecil Gray was the only child of her second marriage. A devout Roman Catholic, she arranged his school education accordingly. This began in 1920 at a residential convent primary school at Bath, and continued from 1923 until 1931 at Ampleforth College, the Benedictine public school in north Yorkshire, where he developed interests in science, acting, and music, and a calling to be a monk. Owing to &#145;petty transgressions&#146;, however, he lasted only two months as a novice at Ampleforth Abbey and then turned to medical studies at Liverpool University where he trained from 1931 to 1937. On 18 September 1937 he married Marjorie Kathleen Hely (1909&#150;1978), daughter of Herbert William Byrne Hely, dental surgeon. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After graduating Gray went into general practice. As an assistant GP in central Liverpool he began giving dental anaesthetics, as GPs did, which is where his interest in anaesthesia began. His medical training in giving anaesthetics had been &#145;abysmal&#146;, consistent with the low status of a speciality still largely the province of part-time GP-anaesthetists giving ether for major surgery. After buying his own general practice at Wallasey in 1939 he volunteered to assist the most distinguished Liverpool GP-anaesthetist, Robert J. Minnitt, the inventor of the &#145;gas and air&#146; analgesia apparatus that was transforming British midwifery. By employing a practice assistant Gray was eventually assisting Minnitt two days a week at Liverpool's Northern Hospital and in 1942 gained the recently introduced diploma in anaesthetics. By then he had sold his bomb-blasted practice to take a half-time post as anaesthetist at Liverpool's Sefton Hospital and assist several local surgeons in private practice, among them Charles Wells, whom he later described as the finest surgeon he ever encountered, and who was to become a major ally.<br>
<br>Soon Gray was working sixty-hour weeks and feeling fit for military service, for which he had been turned down in 1940 owing to the asthma he suffered. On re-applying, he was called up to the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) in September 1942 and trained at Oxford for service with one of the mobile neurosurgery units designed by Oxford's leading neurosurgeon, Hugh Cairns. As a captain in the RAMC Gray was shipped with his unit to north Africa in December 1942 and served in the Tunisia campaign from February to May 1943, but not long afterwards severe bronchopneumonia ended his military service.<br>
<br>Soon after returning to hospital practice in Liverpool early in 1944 Gray began the research collaboration with his local colleague John Halton that laid the foundations of subsequent anaesthetic practice. Through Halton's connections with the nearby Burtonwood US Air Force base they had early knowledge of the pioneering use of curare in North America, before wartime medical journals had spread the story of how this muscle relaxant was being used as a supplement to general anaesthesia. Formerly, deep general anaesthesia had been the sole means of producing adequate relaxation of musculature during major surgery. Intrigued, Gray and Halton acquired through Halton's Burtonwood connections trial supplies of intocostrin, the purified curare being produced in the USA. Used as recommended, it produced the supplementary muscle relaxation of which they had heard, but by the time supplies ran out they were committed to further exploration of its potential. Fortune favoured them when Gray remembered d-tubocurarine chloride being used in physiology experiments at Liverpool University, from where hundreds of ampoules of this curare-related compound were acquired. Using the contents of the first of these, Gray had the breakthrough moment that led to revolutionary improvements in the use of general anaesthetics. Unsure of how much d-tubocurarine chloride to use, he dissolved the contents of an ampoule (possibly 100mg) in a pint bottle of sterile saline solution ready for dripping into a patient undergoing a cholecystectomy at Liverpool's Northern Hospital. With the patient anaesthetized with pentathol and the surgeon James Rawlinson opening the abdomen, this dripping-in began and was followed by a sudden dramatic loss of muscle tension which left surgeon and anaesthetist shocked. Once Gray had begun assisting the patient's breathing, which had dropped, the operation progressed with remarkable ease and far lighter anaesthetic, which had considerable advantages.<br>
<br>Gray had stumbled on the benefits of using muscle relaxant less sparingly than ever risked before and soon he and Halton, in their different hospitals, were using concentrations that produced major skeletal muscle paralysis. This meant taking over the patient's breathing by manual, air-bag ventilation, but the rewards were unprecedented muscle relaxation and the need for only light anaesthesia throughout major surgery. Gray concentrated on abdominal surgery cases in Liverpool and Halton on thoracic cases at Clatterbridge Hospital on the Wirral. They met almost weekly to discuss outcomes and refinements of their technique over a pint or two at Liverpool's historic Ye Cracke public house. Within months they had progressed to using the reversal agent prostigmine to terminate the paralysis they induced, Gray meanwhile testing for risks to the heart of their new procedure, which his laboratory animal experiments at Liverpool University showed as negligible. In just over a thousand surgical operations in 1945&#150;6 Gray and Halton refined their procedure and validated its revolutionary effectiveness, the details of which they presented in a paper to the anaesthetics section of the Royal Society of Medicine in London in May 1946, which was justly titled &#145;D-tubocurarine chloride&#151;a milestone in anaesthesia?&#146; Its publication in the society's <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> sent reverberations through the world of anaesthetics and was the beginning of modern general anaesthesia. Although cautiously slow, its uptake by a conservative clinical speciality led to rapid advances in surgery.<br>
<br>Gray (known as T. Cecil Gray) received an MD degree from Liverpool University in 1947 for a thesis on his investigations of 1944&#150;6 and in the same year was appointed head of the university's new department of anaesthetics, as reader in anaesthesia. In his first year in this appointment he created the country's first day-release course for young clinicians who were preparing for the diploma in anaesthetics. By the mid-1950s his fine teaching, leadership, and skill in the appointment of staff had secured a reputation for his department that drew postgraduate students from around the world to learn the &#145;Liverpool technique&#146;. The first lecturer he appointed was Gordon Jackson Rees, who under Gray's direction pioneered paediatric anaesthetics in Britain and became his closest ally. Gray became professor of anaesthesia in Liverpool in 1959 and remained as head of the department until his retirement in 1976. From 1970 to 1976 he served also as Liverpool's dean of medicine. His research influence continued into the 1970s as a co-author of papers on the clinical monitoring of neuromuscular block by muscle relaxants. The train-of-four twitch technique of monitoring that his team devised was soon adopted by anaesthetists worldwide.<br>
<br>On a national level Gray made profound contributions to the development of anaesthetics as a speciality, both as a foundation member from 1948 to 1969 of the board of the faculty of anaesthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, of which he was the dean from 1964 to 1967, and from 1948 to 1976 as a member of the council of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, of which he was the president from 1956 to 1959. Between 1948 and 1964 his editorial skills lifted the status of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Anaesthesia</span>. He also edited major textbooks, including <span class="italic">Modern Trends in Anaesthesia</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">General Anaesthesia</span> (1959), both of which went through several editions. Internationally he lectured widely on the Liverpool technique and refinements to it and in 1961 was the first anaesthetist recipient of the Sir Arthur Simms travelling fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.<br>
<br>For his contributions to anaesthetics Gray was appointed a CBE in 1976, which many in the field thought an inadequate recognition of his achievements. His devoted contributions to the Roman Catholic Church were honoured in 1982 when he became a knight commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great. Following the death of his first wife, on 24 August 1979 he married Pamela Mary Corning (<i>b</i>. 1942/3), hospital secretary, and daughter of Charles Frederick Corning, engineer; they had one son. Gray died at his home in Ravenmeols Lane, Formby, Liverpool, on 5 January 2008, of gastrointestinal bleeding. He was survived by his wife, Pamela, and his three children.<br>
