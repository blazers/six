<span class="headword">Bainham,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1532), <span class="occ">lawyer and protestant martyr</span>, was the youngest son of Sir Alexander Bainham and Elizabeth Langley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tracy, of Westbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire, and nephew through his mother of Sir William Tracy, the evangelical landowner from Toddington in Gloucestershire whose will was refused probate in 1531 because of its heretical content. The source of his early education is unknown, but he probably attended a grammar school for he knew both Latin and Greek; later he was admitted to the inns of court and became a lawyer. However, he did not confine his energies to the law; he also espoused the evangelical faith articulated so eloquently in his uncle's will. Foxe describes him as &#145;an earnest reader of Scriptures, [and] a great maintainer of the godly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 4.697).<br>
<br>In 1531 Bainham was brought before Sir Thomas More, then lord chancellor, and accused of heresy. He had been linked to the evangelical cause after his marriage to Simon Fish's widow. Fish, a lawyer and evangelical pamphleteer, had previously come to More's attention following the publication of his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Supplication of Beggars</span>. He had been charged with heresy, but recanted before his death in 1531. A few months later Bainham married Fish's widow. According to Foxe, when Bainham first appeared before More, the chancellor attempted to persuade him to return to the traditional faith. Meeting with no success, More had him imprisoned in the Tower, where he was tortured. On 15 December 1531 he was brought before John Stokesley, bishop of London, and examined concerning his beliefs. Initially, he held to his evangelical beliefs, but after several re-examinations, he abjured these on 8 February 1532 and was released from prison.<br>
<br>Bainham soon regretted his decision, however, and publicly reasserted his evangelical beliefs. He was arrested as a result of this relapse and returned to the Tower, and on 19 April 1532 was brought back before the chancellor of the diocese of London. Reminded of his previous abjuration, Bainham rejected it, and went even further by explicitly denying the doctrine of transubstantiation, a clear and unequivocal indication of his heretical beliefs. Next day he was condemned to be burnt by the bishop's vicar-general, and was returned to the Tower, where he was apparently housed in a dark, dungeon-like space. According to Foxe, Hugh Latimer visited him there and found him &#145;syttyng upon a couche of straw with a boke and a waxe candell in his hand praying and readyng&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 4.770). On this occasion Bainham asserted that the cause of his condemnation was his rejection of the doctrine of purgatory. On 30 April 1532, just ten days after his condemnation, he was burnt at Smithfield. As the flames consumed his limbs, Bainham allegedly declared, &#145;O ye papists! Behold &hellip; a miracle; for in this fire I feel no more pain than if I were in a bed of down: but it is to me as a bed of roses&#146;  (ibid., 4.705).<br>
