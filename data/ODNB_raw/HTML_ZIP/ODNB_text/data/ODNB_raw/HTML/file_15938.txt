<span class="headword">Lambert <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Nicholson]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1538), <span class="occ">religious radical</span>, was a native of Norfolk. His family name was Nicholson, but at an unrecorded date he changed his surname to Lambert. He was educated at Cambridge, where he graduated BA in the year 1519/20. Shortly afterwards he was the subject of an exchange of letters between Queens' College and its patron Katherine of Aragon. It would appear that Lambert (as he was already known) aspired to become a fellow and had gained the support of the queen. The master and fellows were reluctant to admit him, and asked for the right of free election, but must ultimately have submitted, since Lambert is subsequently recorded as a fellow, though only between Michaelmas 1521 and Easter 1522. It is possible that during the early 1520s he attended the gatherings for religious discussion held in Cambridge's White Horse tavern; according to John Bale it was at this time that he was exposed to the evangelical teaching of Thomas Bilney, a leading figure at these meetings.<br>
<br>Lambert left Cambridge some time after 1522, and his subsequent movements are obscure. He himself later told Archbishop William Warham that he had been ordained within the diocese of Norwich. John Foxe states that Lambert was forced to leave England and take up residence in Antwerp, where he became preacher and chaplain to the English House. Foxe also suggests that during the late 1520s Lambert met John Frith and William Tyndale in the Low Countries. There is uncertainty, too, over the events in Lambert's life in the early 1530s. Foxe claims that he was &#145;disturbed&#146; by Sir Thomas More and carried back from Antwerp to England to answer charges relating to the translation of heretical texts. He was probably examined on a charge of heresy before convocation on 27 March 1531, and was certainly imprisoned during the period 1531&#150;2 and questioned by Warham, firstly at Lambeth and later at the archbishop's manor house at Otford. Foxe prints forty-five articles which were &#145;ministered&#146; against Lambert, together with the latter's replies to them. Lambert is careful not to answer directly questions relating to the sacrament of the altar. He does, however, express a number of proto-protestant views including rejecting &#145;ear-confession&#146;, denying knowledge of purgatory, and questioning the efficacy of going on pilgrimages. In these replies Lambert also refers to the doctrine of justification by faith stating that, &#145;it is the usage of Scripture to say, faith only doth justify, and work salvation, before a man do any other good works&#146;  (Foxe, 1583, 1117). There is no record of the result of these examinations and Lambert appears to have been discharged following the death of Warham on 25 August 1532. After this Lambert may have resigned from the priesthood&#151;Foxe records that he taught Latin and Greek, and claims that he contemplated getting married and joining the Grocers' Company. It is not clear, however, that he actually took either of these steps.<br>
<br>Some time before 13 March 1536 Lambert was accused of heresy by the duke of Norfolk, who complained of attacks made by Lambert upon the worship of saints. Questioned by Archbishop Cranmer and bishops Shaxton and Latimer, Lambert refused to change his beliefs concerning saints despite being offered a compromise by his examiners, who were afraid that his extremism would discredit their own reforming cause. How Lambert's examination ended is uncertain, but for the next two years he was active in evangelical circles in London, one of a group of gospellers whose impassioned sermons proclaimed &#145;only belief, only, only, nothing else&#146;  (Brigden, 266). Finally, in 1538 he was accused of holding heretical views on the sacrament of the altar. Imprisoned by Cranmer, he appealed to Henry VIII.<br>
<br>Lambert's trial before Henry on 16 November 1538 was a grand political and public occasion that gave rise to much contemporary comment. John Husee writing to Lord Lisle gives a detailed description of how the King's Hall of York Place was set out with &#145;scaffolds, bars and seats&#146; on both sides of the hall. At noon, according to Husee, Lambert was brought before Henry, the latter sitting with &#145;the most parts of lords temporal and spiritual&#146; and was confronted with a number of articles, the most important of which concerned the sacrament of the altar. Husee writes that, &#145;It was not a little rejoicing unto all his Grace's commons, and also to all others that saw and heard, how his Grace handled and used this matter; for it shall be a precedent while the world standeth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lisle Letters</span>, 5.1273). Sir Thomas Elyot voiced a similar view of this event in the preface to his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, writing of:<blockquote>a divine influence or spark of divinity which late appeared to all them that beheld your Grace sitting in the throne of your royal estate as Supreme Head of the Church of England next under Christ, about the division and condemnation of the pernicious errors of the most detestable heretic, John Nicolson, called also Lambert.</blockquote>In his <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> John Foxe gives a very different version of this event. He describes the king in extremely negative terms, telling how during the examination Henry's brows were &#145;bent unto severity&#146; showing &#145;a mind full of wrath and indignation&#146;. He recounts a number of exchanges between Henry and Lambert, perhaps the most famous being one concerning the sacrament of the altar.<blockquote>
<div>Lambert: I answer, with St. Augustine, that it is the body of Christ after a certain matter.<br>
</div>
<div>The King: Answer me neither out of St Augustine, nor by the authority of any other; but tell me plainly whether thou sayest it is the body of Christ or no.<br>
</div>
<div>Lambert: Then I deny it to be the body of Christ.<br>
</div>
<div>The King: Mark well! for now thou shalt be condemned even by Christ's own words, <i>Hoc est corpus meum</i>.<br>
</div> (Foxe, 1583, 530)</blockquote>A number of bishops also took part in the examination of Lambert, notably John Stokesley and Cranmer, although it seems unlikely that Stephen Gardiner took the leading role given to him by Foxe. By the end of the day Lambert had been condemned with the sentence of death being read out by Thomas Cromwell. Lambert was executed by burning at Smithfield on 22 November 1538.<br>
<br>John Bale credited Lambert with translating some of the writings of Erasmus into English, but the only work that can be safely ascribed to him is <span class="italic">A treatyse made by Johan Lambert unto Kynge Henry the viii concernynge hys opynyon in the sacrament of the altar</span> (1548?; STC 15180). In this text Lambert bases his arguments concerning the nature of the sacrament of the altar on the writings of the &#145;ancient doctors&#146; of the church and not on the work of continental protestant writers. His views as expressed both in this treatise and during his examinations place him within the same tradition of native English religious teaching as Thomas Bilney and John Frith. It should be noted, however, that Lambert's <span class="italic">Treatyse</span> was edited by Bale, and that although it is not particularly radical in terms of mid-Tudor protestantism it is possible that Lambert's views as originally uttered were more extreme then those presented in this tract. The chronicler Charles Wriothesley records that in 1538 Lambert was charged and convicted of holding some relatively radical views, for instance that infants were not to be baptized and that Christ did not partake of the flesh of Mary, as well as of such mainstream protestant beliefs as the rejection of the real presence in the mass and the view that the scriptures could not be interpreted without faith.<br>
