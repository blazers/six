<span class="headword">Donatus</span> <span class="st"> [St Donatus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 876), <span class="occ">bishop of Fiesole</span>, was an Irishman of noble birth; nothing more is known of his ancestry. According to the <span class="italic">Vita sancti Donati episcopi</span>, preserved in two Florentine manuscripts, he decided to go abroad as a pilgrim to visit the basilica of the apostles and other sacred sites. At that time the church of Faesulae, now Fiesole, near Florence, had been plundered by the vikings and was without a bishop. The people were praying in their church when Donatus entered. As he did so, the bells pealed and the lamps burst into light miraculously. The people, realizing that their prayers had been answered, insisted that he should be their bishop. Events may not have been as fortuitous as they appear, however; he may have been tutored by D&uacute;ngal at Pavia in the years preceding his election to the episcopate of Fiesole.<br>
<br>The timescale of Donatus's episcopate can be established from a range of references to his presence at various church councils. In 826, at a Roman council under Pope Eugenius II, the bishop of Fiesole is named as Grusolphus; hence election of Donatus must be subsequent to that but before 844 when he is recorded as being present at the consecration of Louis, son of Lothar, as king of the Lombards. The charters at Bobbio indicate that in 850 he commissioned a church at Piacenza which he dedicated to St Brigit and granted to the monastery of Bobbio. Likewise, he was present at the Council of Ravenna in 861 or 862 and applied for redress to the emperor for the destruction wreaked by the vikings in Fiesole, an application confirmed by Charles the Bald in 875 or 876 at Piacenza. But by 877, at the Council of Florence, Zenobius was present as bishop of Fiesole. We may assume therefore that Donatus died in 876. In his epitaph, supposedly his own composition, he states that his episcopate lasted forty-seven years (&#145;octonis lustris septenis insuper annis&#146;). If so, it presumably began in 829.<br>
<br>In addition to his own epitaph, Donatus has been credited with the <span class="italic">Vita metrica sanctae Brigidae</span>, a poem of at least 2004 lines on the life of the Irish saint. It is preserved in five Italian manuscripts ranging in date from the eleventh to the seventeenth century none of which contains a full text, and, to judge from the prose version derived from it, what survives may represent only about two-thirds of it. The attribution to Donatus is based on a number of points, some more circumstantial than others. Two of the twelfth-century copies contain a twenty-eight line prologue beginning &#145;ego Donatus virtutes sanguine Scottus | Bricte descripsi &hellip;&#146; (as a result of this Lapidge and Sharpe name him Donatus Scottus, but Scottus seems to be an epithet rather than part of his name). Moreover, there are close verbal parallels between the <span class="italic">Vita metrica</span> and Donatus's epitaph (<span class="italic">Vita sancti Donati</span>, chap. 27). His interest in Brigit is also evidenced by his commission of a church dedicated to her. Furthermore, according to the <span class="italic">De S. Brigida virgine Faesulis in Etruria</span>, St Brigit of Fiesole was the sister of Andreas, pupil and archdeacon to Donatus. There is, then, enough evidence to associate Donatus with Brigit, but it is not clear how much of the metrical life beyond the prologue can be attributed to him, since the closest verbal parallels to his life are with the prologue and the author of that may not be the author of all of the rest. The Brigidine sources of the poem seem to have included the <span class="italic">Vita prima</span>, the (largely) Old Irish <span class="italic">Bethu Brigte</span>, and Cogitosus. A prose life based on the poem is extant in three manuscripts and it too has been attributed to Donatus but there are sufficient misunderstandings and confusions to make it unlikely that the same person composed both. Mario Esposito  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 129) has also attributed the poem &#145;&hellip; Praesulis Donato abbati&#146; to Donatus, though this has been rejected by Kissane.<br>
