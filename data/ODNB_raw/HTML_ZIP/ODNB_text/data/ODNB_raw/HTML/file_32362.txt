<span class="headword">Channer,  George Nicholas</span>  (1842&#150;1905), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Allahabad, India, on 7 January 1842, the eldest surviving son of eight children of George Girdwood Channer (1811&#150;1895), colonel, Bengal artillery. His mother was Susan (<i>d</i>. 1895), eldest daughter of Nicholas Kendall JP, vicar of Talland and Lanlivery, Cornwall. Educated at Truro grammar school and Cheltenham College (1856&#150;9), he passed direct on 4 September 1859 into the Indian army, but served with the 89th and 95th regiments until 7 August 1866, when he entered the Bengal staff corps. He was first on active service in the north-west frontier campaign in 1863&#150;4. He served in the Ambela campaign, and was at the actions of 16 and 17 December 1863 against the Sitana fanatics. He afterwards was with General Wilde's column in Jadoor country in 1864. He also took part in the Lushai operations in 1871&#150;2.<br>
<br>Channer next served, when a captain, with the 1st Gurkhas in the Malay peninsula in 1875&#150;6, and when with the Malacca column in operations in Sungei Ujong, Terrachi, and Srimenanti won the Victoria Cross on 20 December 1875. He was sent forward in command of a party of his Gurkhas to reconnoitre the road across the Burkit Putus Pass, which was known to be occupied by the enemy, though owing to the terrain and dense jungle it was impossible to ascertain without close approach either the number of the enemy or the strength of their defences. Selecting two men only to support him, he pushed on into the jungle. Discovering a Malay to act as his unwitting guide, he reached the stockade, within which the enemy were in force. He and his two men leaped the stockade, which was formidably constructed, and rushed on the enemy, who were at a meal. Shots were exchanged, but under the impression that a large force was at hand the enemy bolted, and the remainder of the Gurkhas occupied the captured position. In his dispatch Colonel Clay, commanding the column, claimed Channer's foresight and intrepidity prevented great loss of life. The gallant deed practically brought the campaign to a close. Channer was mentioned in dispatches, and promoted brevet major on 12 April 1876.<br>
<br>Channer served with the expedition against the Jowaki Afridis in 1877. He was with the 29th Punjab infantry in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&#150;80) and with the Kurram field force, and was present in command of the regiment at the attack and capture of the Peiwar Kotal; he was mentioned in dispatches, and received the clasp and the brevet of lieutenant-colonel on 22 November 1879. He attained the rank of colonel in the army on 22 November 1883, at the early age of forty-one. In 1888 he commanded the 1st brigade of the Hazara field force, under General John McQueen, in the expedition to the Black Mountain to punish the population for an attack on British troops in British territory. He was mentioned in dispatches and was nominated CB on 10 April 1889.<br>
<br>Channer returned to his command, at Jullundur, and received the reward for distinguished service on 9 September 1892. He was colonel on the Bengal staff from 19 November 1888 to 17 August 1890, and brigadier-general from 22 April 1892 to 11 December 1896, in command of the Assam district. He attained the rank of major-general on 27 April 1893, and was promoted lieutenant-general on 9 November 1896 and general on 12 January 1899. In November 1901 he was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list.<br>
<br>Channer married in June 1872 Annie Isabella, daughter of John William Watson of Shooter's Hill. They had four surviving sons (two served in the army) and four daughters. Channer died on 13 December 1905 at his residence, Buckleigh, Westward Ho!, Devon, survived by his wife.<br>
