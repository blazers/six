<span class="headword">David,  Jacob</span>  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1689), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, born in Darnetal near Rouen, France, was the son of David David (<i>d</i>. 1677), a clothier. Vouched for as a devout protestant of good character, he was invited to England in 1668 by the London merchant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45546/', "Charles Marescoe (1633?&#150;1670)")</script>, who conducted a large-scale trade with Sweden. Employed as bookkeeper at &pound;40 per annum, David was left &pound;25 in his master's will and shortly after was taken into a quadripartite partnership by the widow, Leonora Marescoe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lethieullier [<a name="cosubject_45545"></a><span class="headword">Leonora David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1637&#150;1715?)<span class="occ"></span>], who provided his &pound;1000 capital investment. In 1673 the partnership, worth over &pound;15,000, was re-formed between Leonora and David alone; their marriage in the autumn of 1675 brought him into the Huguenot merchant aristocracy of London.<br>
<br>David thus acquired a share of responsibility for the three surviving daughters of Leonora and the management of their inheritance, which entitled them to marriage portions of some &pound;7100 each. The eldest daughter, Leonora II (<i>b</i>. 1659), had been recently married in lavish style to Thomas Frederick (1650&#150;1720), son of a former lord mayor of London, but quarrels between mother and daughter soon degenerated into serious allegations of fraud against the Davids. Leonora's gross extravagance, which is amply recorded in her ledgers, and her concealment of some profitable East India Company shares, laid the Davids open to proceedings in the City of London's court of orphans and between 1679 and 1687 a chancery suit on behalf of the daughters was dragged out to a crushing conclusion. Another daughter, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1661), was married off in 1679 to John Lewknor (1658&#150;1707), a member of parliament for Sussex, from whom she eloped in 1685 with another member, William Montagu (1652&#150;1691), and in July 1681 an unlicensed marriage of the youngest daughter, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1666), to the allegedly penniless Frenchman, David Gansel of Rouen, led to Jacob David's arrest by the City authorities and a &pound;2000 fine. This was paid off by his wife's aldermanic kinsmen, Sir John Lethieullier and Sir William Hooker, but on 9 October 1685, faced with the final judgment of the court of chancery, Jacob and Leonora fled to Amsterdam, where they were eventually joined by their own children, Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1676) and a son (<i>b</i>. 1678). Early in 1689 both children died of smallpox and in May, after a violent illness, David followed.<br>
<br>At the height of his prosperity in the 1670s David had been a respected and generous member of the French Protestant church in Threadneedle Street, of which he was a deacon in 1676&#150;8 and an elder in 1684. Acting as banker for some of the church's investments he was also actively involved in the church's efforts to relocate newly arrived Huguenot refugees. He had secured denization for himself on 14 October 1675 and his naturalization by private bill obtained royal assent on 16 April 1677. There is no record of his London citizenship but he was made free of the East India Company by redemption on 5 December 1679 and he was admitted to the Eastland Company in 1681. Nevertheless his controlling grasp on imports of Swedish pitch and tar and his close liaison with Dutch entrepreneurs laid him open to suspicion from a government which felt it could not trust such vital strategic goods in an alien's hands. His arrest by the City and subsequent travails were noted with some satisfaction by an anti-French public.<br>
<br>Despite her influential connections with rich and powerful merchants and aldermen, such as her brothers Sir John, Christopher, and William Lethieullier, Leonora remained an embittered exile, corresponding infrequently with the incumbent of Low Leyton parish, the distinguished antiquarian John Strype (1643&#150;1737), about erecting a memorial to her first husband, &#145;dear Mr Marescoe&#146;. With him, in the 1660s, Leonora had run a thrifty household on about &pound;10 per week, but her second marriage had liberated an extravagant nature, which lavished &pound;500 on her eldest daughter's wedding and established &pound;50 per week as her average &#145;fraits des mesnage&#146;. It was undoubtedly her initiative which devised the concealment of assets in her first husband's inventory and, in collusion with David, schemed to evade the consequences. Although still pursued by lawsuits with her daughters, she remained unrepentant and lived on in Amsterdam, probably until 1715, when responsibility for the suits passed to her executors.<br>
