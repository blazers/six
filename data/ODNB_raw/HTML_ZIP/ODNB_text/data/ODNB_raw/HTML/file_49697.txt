<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aldridge,  Ira Frederick</span>  (1807?&#150;1867), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was probably born on 24 July 1807 in New York city, the son of Daniel Aldridge, a lay preacher. Little is known of his mother, Lurona, who died when he was a youth. He was the first major African-American actor, although virtually all of his appearances were in Britain or on the continent; best known for his tragic roles, he was also successful in a variety of comic parts.<br>
<br>Aldridge's origins have often been romanticized: an anonymous 1849 publication, <span class="italic">Memoir and Theatrical Career of Ira Aldridge</span>, tells a tale, often repeated, that he was born in Senegal, the son of a royal family of the Fulah tribe. Based on the evidence, it seems most likely that he and his father were both free-born African-Americans. The <span class="italic">Memoir</span> is sometimes attributed to Aldridge, who may have had a hand in creating such a marketably romantic &#145;history&#146;.<br>
<br>Aldridge was attracted to the theatre as a child, and attended performances at New York's Park Theatre. While a student at the city's African Free School he became involved in the short-lived African Theatre, where, according to the <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, he first played the part of Rolla in Sheridan's <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, a part to which he would later return. After the closing of the African Theatre, when it became apparent that the opportunities for roles would be severely limited in the United States, Aldridge sailed for England some time around 1824. According to another popular but unconfirmed tale he travelled as a servant to the American actor Henry Wallack.<br>
<br>Aldridge made his London d&eacute;but on 10 October 1825, at the Royal Coburg Theatre, playing the part of Oronooko in <span class="italic">The Revolt of Surinam, or, A Slave's Revenge</span> (an adaptation of Thomas Southern's <span class="italic">Oronooko</span>). During his time at the Royal Coburg he performed in such other works as Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">The Slave</span> and J. H. Amherst's <span class="italic">The Death of Christophe</span>. From the beginning of his career, reviewers focused on his appearance: he was generally described as tall and well built; it was common for critics to note, with some surprise, that he was not as dark-skinned as actors in &#145;blackface&#146;, but rather was &#145;almost a light brown&#146;, with a &#145;mulatto tint&#146;. His voice was described as &#145;rich and melodious&#146;, but some reviewers considered it nasal or whiny; the contradiction may be on account of varying responses to an American accent (many critics comment on his &#145;strikingly un-English&#146; pronunciation, and George Eliot found it intolerable). He was given the sobriquet &#145;the African Roscius&#146;.<br>
<br>Much of Aldridge's early career in Britain, when he was known as &#145;Mr Keene&#146;, found him in the provincial theatres, including those at Hull, Brighton, Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, and Edinburgh, and in the theatres of London's East End. <span class="italic">Othello</span>, <span class="italic">The Slave</span>, and Bickerstaffe's <span class="italic">The Padlock</span> were the staples of his repertory. He was married for the first time shortly after his arrival in England, to Margaret Gill (<i>c</i>.1800&#150;1864).<br>
<br>Aldridge made his West End d&eacute;but at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in 1833, when he played <span class="italic">Othello</span> barely two weeks after the death of Kean, who had been playing the Moor on that very stage. Aldridge was forced to circulate handbills defending his adoption of Kean's part. The reviews were a fascinating mix, indicative of the feelings Aldridge inspired in critics. Some, as in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, were unable to get beyond a consideration of his race; the <span class="italic">Theatrical Observer</span>, in a typical pun, noted that his performance was &#145;very <i>fair</i> for a <i>black</i>&#146;. In general the more even-tempered reviewers focused on his &#145;naturalness&#146;. Notably, they mention the overwhelmingly favourable response from the audience. After two performances Covent Garden closed for five days, and Aldridge's remaining performances were cancelled, possibly as a result of the hostility of the press. Aldridge sought out new roles beyond those of his standard repertory, and he in fact revived Shakespeare's rarely produced <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span> at the Britannia Theatre in 1852; in his revision the Moor Aaron became an unlikely tragic hero.<br>
<br>After continuing his work in the provinces and in Ireland, Aldridge began his first continental tour in 1852, and it was here that he received his warmest welcome from the theatrical community. Appearances in Switzerland and Germany, where he played in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, <span class="italic">The Padlock</span>, and <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, were met with great acclaim; there and in various parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire he was able to move with ease among aristocrats and artists. On his visits to Russia in 1858 and 1862 he was credited with introducing a more naturalistic acting style and encouraging the production of Shakespeare's plays. It was on one such European tour, in 1857 or 1858, that he met the woman who was to become his second wife, Amanda Pauline von Brandt (<i>d</i>. 1915). They married on 20 April 1865, after Margaret Aldridge's death the previous year, and had four children: Irene (1860&#150;1932), Ira Frederick Olaff (1862&#150;1886), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61850/', "Amanda Christina Elizabeth Aldridge (1866&#150;1956)")</script>, and Rachel Margaret Frederika (<i>b</i>. 1868, after her father's death). Aldridge's eldest child, Ira Daniel, was born in May 1847, when his first wife was nearly fifty and already in ill health; the child apparently was not hers.<br>
<br>Having returned to England in 1855, Aldridge again toured the provinces and appeared in the East End. After a second continental tour had enhanced his reputation he was offered work at the Lyceum, and the response of the London press this time was much more respectful. Still, the theatres and audiences on the continent evidently offered Aldridge greater artistic range and freedom. It was on one such continental tour, when in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, Poland, that he died of an apparent lung infection on 7 August 1867. He was buried on 9 August in the city's Evangelical cemetery.<br>
