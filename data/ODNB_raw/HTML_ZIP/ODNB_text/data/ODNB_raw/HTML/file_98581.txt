<span class="headword">Franca,  Celia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Nita Celia Franks]</span>  (1921&#150;2007), <span class="occ">ballet dancer, choreographer, and ballet director</span>, was born on 25 June 1921 at 57 Nicholas Street, Mile End, London, the daughter of Solomon Franks, boot salesman, later ladies' outfitter, and his wife, Gertie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Feigenbaum. Her parents were of Jewish descent. She started dance lessons at the age of four, and won scholarships to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Royal Academy of Dance. She made her professional d&eacute;but as a tap dancer in the musical comedy <span class="italic">Spread It Abroad</span>, aged fourteen. Its choreographer, Walter Gore, recommended her to Marie Rambert, and she joined the Ballet Rambert in 1936, also attending Rambert's school, where she was taught by Stanislas Idzikowsky, Vera Volkova, and Antony Tudor. Having adopted the stage name Celia Franca, over the next few years she danced in over two dozen ballets with the company, including Tudor's acclaimed <span class="italic">Jardin aux lilas</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Dark Elegies</span> (1937), and his <span class="italic">Suite of Airs</span> (1937, broadcast on television), a revival of Frederick Ashton's <span class="italic">Les masques</span> (playing both the wife and the lady friend), Frank Staff's <span class="italic">Peter and the Wolf</span> (1940), and work by Ninette de Valois, Andr&eacute;e Howard, and others. She also produced her own choreography, notably <span class="italic">Constanza's Lament</span> (1938), to Beethoven's music, and <span class="italic">Midas</span> (1939) to a score by Elizabeth Lutyens.<br>
<br>Following the closure of Ballet Rambert in 1941 as a result of the disruption of the Second World War, and after a brief engagement with the International Ballet, Franca joined Sadler's Wells, initially replacing the injured June Brae. Among her most notable roles were as the Queen in Robert Helpmann's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (1942), the Prostitute in his <span class="italic">Miracle in the Gorbals</span> (1944), Wrath in Ashton's <span class="italic">The Quest</span> (1943), and the Spider in Howard's <span class="italic">Le festin de l'araign&eacute;e</span> (1944). She was reputed by many to be the company's best dramatic dancer. For Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet (when the main company moved to Covent Garden she decided she would be bored by three months of <span class="italic">Sleeping Beauty</span>, so did not follow) she choreographed <span class="italic">Khadra</span> (1946), to Sibelius's music, and <span class="italic">Bailemos</span> (1947) to Massenet's. In 1947 she joined the small Metropolitan Ballet as soloist and ballet mistress, choreographing <span class="italic">Dance of Salome</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">Eve of St Agnes</span> (1950), both televised. After performances with the Ballet Workshop she then returned briefly to Ballet Rambert. Meanwhile, on 27 February 1941, at Watford register office, she had married a fellow Ballet Rambert dancer, Leo Kersley (<i>b</i>. 1920), son of Edwin Charles Kersley, art dealer. They subsequently divorced, but remained close friends.<br>
<br>In 1950 Ninette de Valois was asked to recommend someone to run a new national Canadian ballet. There were then already two Canadian ballet companies, the Russian-influenced Volkoff Ballet and the largely amateur Winnipeg Ballet, but a group of Canadians had decided that they would like a new ballet company, in the style of Ballet Rambert or Sadler's Wells (who had toured triumphantly in North America in 1949). De Valois recommended Franca, who for the next twenty-three years (1951&#150;74) was artistic director and effective shaper of the new National Ballet of Canada, based in Toronto. At first she found the going tough&#151;the ballet's first base was a dilapidated building with pigeons in the rafters, rats in the basement, and barely functioning heating, and Canadians, used to the more flamboyant and athletic style of Russian ballet, did not initially take to Franca's more nuanced repertoire&#151;but she persevered, and succeeded in building a company of international standing. She nurtured local talent, especially through the National Ballet School, which she set up in partnership with Betty Oliphant, but also formed long associations with such stars as Erik Bruhn (with whom she had worked at the Metropolitan Ballet) and the temperamental Rudolf Nureyev (whom she disliked on a personal level).<br>
<br>Franca danced many leading roles with the National Ballet until 1959, when she handed over to a succession of dancers she had trained herself, though she continued to dance the occasional role. She also choreographed, her notable creations including versions of <span class="italic">Nutcracker</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> (1968, which was televised, and won Canada's first Emmy award in 1970). In 1964 she oversaw the company's move to the O'Keefe Centre in Toronto. She also organized and accompanied many international tours by the company. Always demanding as a choreographer and taskmaster and direct in speech, she was increasingly dictatorial in the way she ran the company; one of her leading stars, Karen Kain, described her as &#145;ferocious&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 21 Feb 2007). Already exhausted by constant battles with her board of directors over finance and other matters and disappointed by the reception of some of her more daring productions, she was eventually manoeuvred into resignation in 1974 (blaming a falling out with Betty Oliphant, whom she suspected of trying to usurp her). She nevertheless, after a few years, and particularly after Frederick Ashton's lover Alexander Grant was appointed the company's artistic director, continued to choreograph for the National Ballet, and in 1978 she published a history of the company in collaboration with the photographer Ken Bell. She also served as joint artistic director of the Ottawa School of Dance.<br>
<br>Franca was appointed an officer of the order of Canada in 1967, and a companion of the order in 1985. She was married twice while in Canada: in 1952 to a theatre technician, Hubert Anderson (<i>d</i>. 2004), whom she divorced in 1954; and in 1960 to the clarinettist James Morton (<i>d</i>. 1997). She died in Ottawa on 19 February 2007. She had no children. The Celia Franca Centre, the Canadian National Ballet School's new studio facilities, had been opened in 2006. She was described by the choreographer James Kudelka as &#145;the icon of ballet in Canada&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 22 Feb 2007).<br>
