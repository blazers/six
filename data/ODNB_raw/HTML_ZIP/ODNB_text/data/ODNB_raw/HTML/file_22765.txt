<span class="headword">Price,  Theodore</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and reputed Roman Catholic convert</span>, was born at Bron-y-Foel, in the parish of Llanenddwyn, Dyffyn Ardudwy, Merioneth, the son of Rees ap Tudor and Marjory, daughter of Edward Stanley, constable of Harlech Castle. He originally entered All Souls, Oxford, as a chorister and, having probably transferred to Jesus College, graduated BA on 16 February 1588 and proceeded MA on 9 June 1591. He held his first living, the poor rectory of Llanfair, near Harlech, only briefly, from 18 October 1591. Thereafter his career progressed more swiftly, and he was appointed a prebendary of Winchester in 1596, although he never served as master of the hospital of St Cross, as is sometimes erroneously stated. In 1601 he obtained the rectory of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Denbighshire. It seems likely, however, that Price had remained firmly part of the Oxford scene, and in 1604 he was appointed principal of Hart Hall, a position he held until his resignation in 1622. In 1609 he obtained an Oxfordshire living, the rectory of Launton, and on 5 July 1614 he proceeded DD, as from New College. Price seems to have been well suited to a donnish career: he was later described as of &#145;untainted Life &hellip; of a reverend Presence, liberal, courteous and prudent&#146; as well as &#145;learned in Scholastical Controversies&#146;  (Hacket, 2.97). Although his lectures and a Latin sermon delivered in Oxford were subsequently praised he was not, apparently, a great preacher, a matter which later came back to haunt him. During this period Price evidently took an interest in the fortunes of his old college, Jesus, the Oxford college traditionally favoured by Welshmen. He was one of five commissioners who drew up new statutes for it in 1621, at which time he was also made a fellow.<br>
<br>Price's early patrons are unknown, but his kinsman John Williams, the future archbishop of York, must have been responsible for Price's advancement in mid-career. In 1621 Price was appointed to a prebendal stall at Lincoln Cathedral, where Williams was bishop, and in 1623 Price became a prebendary at Westminster Abbey, where Williams was also the dean. In 1622 Price was one of only two clerics chosen to serve on a commission sent to Ireland to explore various grievances, including a number relating to the parlous state of the Irish church. Price was said to have emerged &#145;with Praise and with Encouragement from His Majesty&#146; and the promise of further advancement  (Hacket, 1.207). Instead, however, there followed a series of disappointments as Bishop Williams's attempts to obtain preferment for Price came to nothing. In 1623 Price was considered for the see of St Asaph, which included his native Merioneth, but he was passed over in favour of John Hanmer. In 1624 the notorious &#145;Arminian&#146;, Richard Mountague, praised Price as one who &#145;loveth the Church&#146; and saw him as a possible candidate for the vacant see of Gloucester  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Cosin</span>, 1.24). In 1625, however, Price apparently broke acrimoniously with Williams over the latter's less than wholehearted support for Price's bid for the archbishopric of Armagh, which went instead to James Ussher. When challenged that Price had virtually ceased preaching for many years and had never preached before the king, Williams &#145;could give no good Answer and drew of[f] with so much ease upon it&#146;  (Hacket, 1.207).<br>
<br>Thereafter, it would appear that Price turned to William Laud, Williams's chief opponent within the Westminster chapter, for further preferment. In 1629, when the see of St Asaph was once again vacant, members of the Durham House group again tipped him for preferment, but ultimately Price found himself passed over once again. By the late 1620s, at the least, Price appears to have aligned himself with Laud's allies, whose strongly ceremonialist leanings he clearly shared. These are confirmed by his will, drawn up in 1631, which included bequests to beautify the chancel of the church in his native parish of Llanenddwyn, and to rail in its altar. In addition Price endowed a sermon at his old college, Jesus, to be preached in support of bowing at the name of Jesus, &#145;against the Scismaticall opinions of theis times&#146;, probably a reference to a recent pamphlet controversy over this practice  (Westminster City Archives, PCW, 174<i>v</i> Camden).<br>
<br>In the minds of contemporaries, however, the likelihood that Laudian-style ceremonialism could transmute itself into outright Roman Catholicism seemed to be confirmed by the circumstances of Price's death, which took place at Westminster on 15 December 1631. Following unsuccessful surgery for &#145;the Torment of the Stone&#146;, Price told Roman Catholic visitors of his &#145;Affection and Devotion&#146; for their church, and received Roman rites. In addition, he emphatically refused to be attended by any Church of England clergyman. The conversion became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, with Price's burial at Westminster Abbey on 21 December seemingly delayed by the reluctance of the prebendaries to conduct a burial service  (Hacket, 2.97). Peter Heylin, one of the Westminster chapter at the time, later claimed that the story of Price's conversion was merely invented by Williams to blacken the reputation of Laud, who had most recently supported Price. Philip Herbert, earl of Pembroke, certainly sought to use the incident against Laud, reportedly remarking to the king, &#145;Is this the Orthodoxe man your Majestie would have made a Bishop the last year? Doe but marke him that recommended him unto you in that kinde&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C115/M35/8387). At Laud's trial William Prynne condemned his familiarity with the &#145;unpreaching epicure &hellip; Arminian&#146; and apostate Price. In reply, Laud did not seek to deny Price's conversion, but merely claimed that Williams &#145;had laboured &hellip; more than I&#146; for Price's preferment  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; William Laud</span>, 6.495). Price's closeness to Laud, however, is suggested by Price's will, in which the archbishop was referred to as &#145;my Noble Lord and worthie auntient freind&#146;. Conversely Williams, although a kinsman, was not named. Price's will also included bequests to Hart Hall, Jesus College, and Oriel College as well as moneys for church beautification, and repairs to organs. Others mentioned in Price's will include &#145;my Noble friend&#146; the Welsh literary figure Hugh Holland, who had previously converted to Catholicism, and two of Price's fellow commissioners in Ireland, Sir William Jones and Sir Thomas Penruddocke. He had apparently never married; his executor was his nephew, Dr William Lewis, the master of St Cross.<br>
