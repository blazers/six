<span class="headword">Bagenal <span class="st"> [Bagnal]</span>, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1590/91), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the second son of John Bagenal (<i>d</i>. 1558), a tailor by trade and mayor of Newcastle under Lyme on several occasions, and Elinor, daughter of Thomas Whittingham of Middlewich, Cheshire. Nothing is known about his early life until 1539 when Bagenal was responsible for the murder of a man in a brawl with &#145;certain light persons&#146;, and fled the law in England to the north of Ireland. There he came under the protection of the paramount chieftain of central Ulster, Conn O'Neill, who shortly thereafter made a compact with the crown under the &#145;surrender and regrant&#146; programme. On 7 December 1542, after O'Neill's ennoblement as earl of Tyrone, the Irish council conveyed a petition to the court of Henry VIII for the pardon of Nicholas Bagenal for murder, at the earl's request. The pardon was granted in 1543.<br>
<br>In 1544 Bagenal requested and was granted permission from the Irish council to be sent to fight in the campaign of the English army in France. Returning to Ireland as a seasoned soldier, he was appointed by Edward VI as marshal of the army there in March 1547. In 1548 he campaigned in Leinster with the lord deputy, Sir Edward Bellingham, who was determined to pacify the midlands and southern highlands. Bagenal participated in the defeat of Cahir O'Connor and the slaughter of many of his kerne. In the early 1550s he was engaged primarily in martial activities in Ulster: he was sent in November 1551 by Lord Deputy Croft to expel the Scots from the Dufferin, and raided the lands of Shane O'Neill in Tyrone on behalf of Shane's half-brother Matthew O'Neill, baron of Dungannon, who represented the English interest in the region. Bagenal was knighted in the same year, and on 22 April 1552 was granted the lands of St Patrick's and St Mary's abbeys in Newry, the lordship of Mourne, and the manor of Carlingford.<br>
<br>On the accession of Queen Mary in 1553 Bagenal lost the office of marshal which was then conferred on Sir George Stanley. He does not appear to have offered any overt opposition to Mary's government, but he may have shared in the odium elicited by the radical protestant views of his elder brother who was also serving in Ireland. Sir Ralph Bagenal protested against the reconciliation with Rome and fled to France, where he was implicated in Henry Dudley's conspiracy. Nicholas, who had also left Ireland, was fearful of returning in the political climate of Mary's reign and was in 1556 bound over in a recognizance of &pound;1000 to attend on the Irish councillors and assume responsibility for his bailiwick in Ulster. Meanwhile he maintained his connection with Staffordshire for which he was elected knight of the shire in 1559. He had about four years earlier married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1573), daughter of Sir Edward Griffith of Penrhyn; they had five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1034/', "Sir Henry Bagenal (c.1556&#150;1598)")</script>, and six daughters.<br>
<br>Much to Bagenal's annoyance on his return to Ireland, Stanley was maintained as marshal by Queen Elizabeth while Sir Nicholas had to be content with a mere captaincy. On 23 April 1562 he wrote to the queen, complaining that his lands in Newry brought him in nothing owing to the depredations of Shane O'Neill, whereas while he was in office they were worth &pound;1000 a year. When Sir Henry Sidney became deputy with the backing of the earl of Leicester (who had always been a patron of Bagenal) Sir Nicholas was reappointed as marshal in a patent dated 5 October 1565. Scarcely had he taken up the office when, early in 1566, he entered into an agreement to sell it and his lands to the adventurer Thomas Stucley for &pound;3000. Sidney was supportive of this proposal, but the queen was justifiably suspicious of Stucley and Bagenal remained marshal.<br>
<br>In this capacity Bagenal continued to serve the crown in Ireland for a quarter of a century. His successful proprietorship of the town and vicinity of Newry made it a bastion of English civility in southern Ulster, and from there Bagenal exercised overlordship of some of the Gaelic rulers of the region. Sidney praised the marshal's settlement of Newry, with its new mansion house and church, as a model of Anglicization, and it was proposed that the town should become the seat of a presidency of Ulster in 1586. Already Bagenal had been appointed chief commissioner for Ulster in 1584, and in the following year he was elected to parliament to represent County Down.<br>
<br>Besides being active in the north, Bagenal was engaged in campaigns elsewhere under successive chief governors. His aggressive forays into southern Leinster exacerbated the cess controversy with the local gentry in 1576, but Bagenal was exonerated of any wrongdoing. His experience and knowledge of Ireland were respected by officials in Dublin and London, but in 1586 a bitter feud developed between Bagenal and Sir John Perrot which lasted until the lord deputy was recalled in 1588. The latter objected to the role of Bagenal and his sons as power-brokers in Ulster, while the marshal was a member of the faction of the Irish council that vehemently opposed the lord deputy's policies. On 15 July 1587 an affray occurred between the two men in Perrot's house as a result of which the aged marshal was knocked to the ground.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1590 Bagenal resigned the office of marshal on grounds of age and ill health, and on condition that it be conferred on his son Sir Henry. He died shortly thereafter, and was buried at Newry on 7 February 1591. Sir Henry succeeded to both the estates and the marshalship.<br>
