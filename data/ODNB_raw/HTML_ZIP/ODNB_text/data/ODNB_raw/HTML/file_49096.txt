<span class="headword">Hawks family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1750&#150;1863), <span class="occ">iron manufacturers and engineers</span>, formed one of the most notable industrial dynasties on Tyneside in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Until its closure in 1889 the family's New Greenwich ironworks at Gateshead was the town's largest employer, and several members of the family firm were prominent in local politics.<br>
<br>The Hawks firm was established by <a name="cosubject_54111"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Hawks</span>  (1708&#150;1755)<span class="occ"></span>, a foreman smith at the iron manufactory established by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37328/', "Sir Ambrose Crowley (1658&#150;1713)")</script> at Swalwell, 2 miles to the west of Newcastle upon Tyne. Hawks and his wife, Jane, had three sons, the eldest of whom, William [ii], was baptized at Gateshead on 29 June 1730. In the late 1740s Hawks decided to work on his own account and established a set of workshops on waste ground along the river foreshore at Gateshead. His scale of operations was modest when compared to the giant enterprise of the Crowleys and displayed little of the organizational and technological sophistication of that firm. Nevertheless, William [i] Hawks was able to exploit the availability of cheap scrap metal, which was carried up the Tyne as ballast by returning collier vessels. Scrap could be reprocessed into the nails, bolts, chains, shovels, and tools for which there was a brisk demand in the local coal industry and shipping trade. This was to be a lucrative niche, employing cheap materials, cheap energy, and simple technology (a hearth and a hammer), and allowing the accumulation of capital (albeit slowly) from a minimal initial outlay. However, the firm had not progressed much beyond this unspectacular beginning by the time its founder died intestate at the age of forty-six, for the administrators of his estate posted a bond of only &pound;39. Hawks died at Gateshead on 23 February 1755, but his wife lived on until 28 February 1773. The works passed to the eldest son, <a name="cosubject_49093"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Hawks</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1730, <em>d.</em> 1810)<span class="occ"></span>; he and his first wife, Elizabeth Dixon (1735/6&#150;1808), whom he married in 1759, are credited with the great expansion of the Hawks industrial empire.<br>
<br>During the 1760s and 1770s William [ii] Hawks featured in several partnerships with local ironmongers and edge tool makers. But it was the formation of a fresh partnership in the late 1770s, with <a name="cosubject_49096"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Longridge</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1751, <em>d.</em> 1803)<span class="occ"></span>, a Sunderland merchant, that was the springboard for a sudden expansion of the Hawks enterprises: a plating forge was acquired at Beamish, co. Durham, in 1779, the first of four separate metalworking sites operated by Hawks and Longridge along Beamish Burn; additional smiths' shops were rented at Ouseburn on the north bank of the Tyne in 1780; a forge at Lumley, co. Durham, was occupied by the firm in the mid-1780s; and in the late 1780s slitting and rolling mills on the River Blyth in the modern county of Northumberland were taken on. By the 1790s the works at Gateshead comprised a substantial industrial complex, now producing steel, anchors, heavy chains, and steam-engine components, as well as a great diversity of smaller iron wares. The supply of ironware to the Navy Board became a speciality&#151;as the title New Greenwich implied. The firm's products were shipped via Hawks's London partners, the Gordon and Stanley families. These families were involved in a series of partnerships with William [ii] Hawks and his successors, with whom the Stanleys intermarried. William [ii] married for a second time in 1809. His new wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1831), was the widow of Joseph Atkinson. Both the Hawks and Stanley families, it may be presumed, could supply the merchant capital which William [ii] Hawks lacked, and both had links to the old ordnance industry of the Weald and the naval yards of the Thames and Medway.<br>
<br>These maritime and military markets were evidently profitable, for the estate of William [ii] Hawks was assessed at &#145;under &pound;30,000&#146; at his death at Gateshead on 4 December 1810, when the works in the north-east passed to his surviving sons: <a name="cosubject_49094"></a><span class="headword">George Hawks</span>  (1766&#150;1820)<span class="occ"></span> of Blackheath, who was born on 19 May 1766 in Gateshead, the firm's London agent, <a name="cosubject_49095"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Shafto Hawks</span>  (1768&#150;1840)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 17 May 1768, and <a name="cosubject_54110"></a><span class="headword">John Hawks</span>  (1770&#150;1830)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 19 February 1770. Increasingly, the firm's activities were focused on Gateshead, where the Hawks works covered 44 acres by the end of the 1830s, supporting a workforce of between 800 and 900. The Ouseburn workshops were relinquished before the eighteenth century was out, while Lumley forge was let to subtenants in the 1840s. The Bedlington works passed eventually to a cousin of the Hawkses, Michael Longridge (1785&#150;1853), a pioneer of railway technology and an associate of Robert Stephenson, under whose superintendence the works became a training ground for a generation of celebrated engineers; some of the most distinguished, such as Sir Daniel Gooch, had links of kinship with the Longridges and the Hawkses. Meanwhile, the Hawkses' industrial eminence in Gateshead was reflected in local political prominence. Robert Shafto Hawks was knighted in 1817 for his role in suppressing riots in the winter of that year and for presenting a loyal address to the prince regent. His nephew and successor as head of the firm, <a name="cosubject_49097"></a><span class="headword">George Hawks</span>  (1801&#150;1863)<span class="occ"></span>, was a political notable in a more liberal vein. Born on 7 January 1801, he was a key local supporter of Sir William Hutt, Gateshead's free-trade MP after 1841, and he served as mayor of the borough in 1836, 1848, and 1849. His home at Redheugh Hall became one of the organizing centres of Liberalism in the north east. He married Elizabeth Clark Wright in 1827, and died on 15 October 1863. He was buried at Gateshead.<br>
<br>The firm reached its apogee in the early Victorian period, when its reputation for engineering and bridge building was worldwide, and to which the striking High Level Bridge across the Tyne, completed by the firm in 1849, stands as a fitting memorial. At its height the New Greenwich works could boast a workforce of more than 2000. However, the grip of the Hawks family upon the firm which bore its name was increasingly tenuous. Of the fourth generation, only George Hawks displayed the entrepreneurial ability of his forebears. Hannah, Lady Hawks (<i>d</i>. 1863), the widow of Sir Robert Shafto Hawks, and her two sons&#151;the one blind, the other destined for the church&#151;sold their shares in 1840 to George Crawshay (1794&#150;1873), a member of the great iron-making family of south Wales, who had himself recently been bought out of his family's iron merchanting business in London by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6656/', "William Crawshay (1788&#150;1867)")</script>. The business developed by William [ii] Hawks had been divided between his three eldest surviving sons in 1810. George Crawshay had thus acquired one of these three blocks. When he was able to acquire the shares of Joseph Stanley Hawks (1790&#150;1875), the only surviving son of George Hawks of Blackheath, he captured a second.<br>
<br>The dominant influence over the firm of Hawks, Crawshay &amp; Sons in its last years was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46851/', "George Crawshay (1821&#150;1896)")</script>, the son of George Crawshay and his wife, Louise (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dufaud, of the family of French ironmasters). Like George Hawks, George Crawshay became a considerable political figure in the north-east. It may be that he devoted too much of his time to his political pursuits, however, for by the 1870s and 1880s the overcrowded Gateshead site, home to a great diversity of processes and product lines, compared unfavourably with the more streamlined and specialized engineering yards established along the Tyne by entrepreneurs such as Sir William Armstrong. Product diversity had once been the foundation of the Hawks family's success; it was increasingly a sign of technological senescence. A crisis was reached in 1889, when New Greenwich was suddenly closed. The circumstances surrounding the closure remain somewhat mysterious, for the firm's creditors were paid in full (and the company's archive destroyed). However, the dismantling of the works finally ended the association of the Hawks family with Gateshead.<br>
