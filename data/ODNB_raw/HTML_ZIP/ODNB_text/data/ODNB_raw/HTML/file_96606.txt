<span class="headword">Elvin,  (Herbert) Lionel</span>  (1905&#150;2005), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 7 August 1905 at 2 Laurel Villas, Hills Road, Buckhurst Hill, Essex, the eldest of the three sons of Herbert Henry Elvin (1874&#150;1949), engineer's clerk, trade unionist, and lay preacher, and his wife, Mary Jane (Dolly), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (1874&#150;1962). There was an older sister, who died in infancy. He was educated at elementary schools and from 1917 at Southend high school where, still known as Herbert or Bert, he achieved academic and sporting success and was the author of a new school song. A scholar at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, from 1924 to 1928, he gained first-class honours in history and English and an athletics blue, and was president of the Union and chairman of the Labour Club. After two years as a Commonwealth fellow at Yale he returned to Trinity Hall as the college's first fellow with responsibility for the teaching of English. On 3 April 1934 (by which time he was using the forename Lionel) he married a 24-year-old schoolteacher, Mona Bedortha (Margaret) Dutton (<i>d</i>. 1997), at the Hampstead register office. She was the daughter of Dr Caleb Samuel Simeon Dutton, minister of religion, of San Francisco. They had one son, (John) Mark Dutton Elvin (<i>b</i>. 1938).<br>
<br>Although unsuccessful as Labour candidate for Cambridge University in the parliamentary election of 1935, Elvin served on the town council and its education committee. He also became an active member of the Workers' Educational Association and treasurer of its eastern district. War service in the Air Ministry (1940&#150;42) and the Ministry of Information (1943&#150;5) was followed by appointment as principal of Ruskin College, Oxford, which reopened in September 1945. His chief rival for the post was Richard Crossman. Elvin was firmly committed to Ruskin and fully in accord with its educational, political, and social principles. Moreover there were family connections, and the Elvin room at Ruskin was named not for Lionel but for his father, Herbert, general secretary of the National Union of Clerks, who had served on the college's governing council. The Ruskin post involved a considerable drop in salary, but in his autobiography Elvin recorded that &#145;I do not think any five years in my career were more enjoyable than those I spent at Ruskin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Encounters with Education</span>, 96). Elvin taught courses in English literature and politics and oversaw the acquisition of new premises and the introduction of students from the USA. His educational experience was further broadened by appointments to national bodies, including the Secondary School Examinations Council and the University Grants Committee (1946&#150;50).<br>
<br>In 1950 Elvin took up a less congenial but more lucrative post as director of the UNESCO department of education, based in Paris. There he encountered new challenges of education in the developing world and of international diplomacy. In 1956 he returned to England as professor of education in tropical areas at London University's Institute of Education. Two years later, following the death in post in 1957 of G. B. Jeffery, he was appointed director of the institute. At this time the Institute of Education comprised not only the &#145;central&#146; institute but also a &#145;wider&#146; institute or area training organization of some thirty colleges of education. Elvin thus found himself head of an organization at a peak of power and influence that was training one-quarter of the teachers in England. Though he had neither trained as a teacher nor taught in a school, Elvin's broad experience and numerous contacts within the worlds of education and politics made him uniquely fitted for the role. Expansion was in the air and he played a crucial role in securing a new building in Bedford Way and in overseeing the introduction of the BEd degree. Nevertheless, by 1973 when he retired with the title of emeritus professor, a sharp decline in the projected numbers of teachers had led to crisis in the colleges. William Taylor, Elvin's successor, would oversee the ending of the area training organisation.<br>
<br>Elvin was active in numerous causes, for example as president of the English New Education Fellowship and of the Council for Education in World Citizenship, as chairman of the Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee, and as a member of the Central Advisory Council for Education (England) and the government of India education commission. He also played a major role on the committee on higher education chaired by Lord Robbins, which reported in 1963. His publications included <span class="italic">Men of America</span> (1941), <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Literature (Poetry)</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Education and Contemporary Society</span> (1965), <span class="italic">The Place of Commonsense in Educational Thought</span> (1977), and his autobiography, <span class="italic">Encounters with Education</span> (1987).<br>
<br>Throughout his career Elvin remained a man of the left, a humanist, and a champion of &#145;peace and the making of a more just society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Encounters with Education</span>, 191). Adherence to his principles led him to refuse many honours, but he did accept the honorary fellowships awarded by Trinity Hall and the Institute of Education, in 1980 and 1993 respectively. His final years were spent at 4 Bulstrode Gardens, Cambridge. Suffering from bronchial cancer and heart disease, he died at Midfield Lodge nursing home, Oakington, Cambridgeshire, on 14 June 2005, less than two months before his 100th birthday. He was survived by his son, Mark, a distinguished scholar of Chinese history.<br>
