</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell,  George Kennedy Allen</span>  (1883&#150;1958), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born at the vicarage, Hayling Island, within sight of the spire of Chichester Cathedral, on 4 February 1883, the eldest child of James Allen Bell, the vicar of Hayling Island, and his wife, Sarah Georgina Megaw. The Bells were a family of farmers and businessmen; the Megaws were bankers from the north of Ireland. It was the kind of secure, comfortable, middle-class clerical home that produced many of the bishops of the church in the twentieth century. When, in his student days, George Bell was asked why he was a Christian, he replied, &#145;First, I was born one&#146;  (Jasper, 17). The Bells moved by stages northwards, first to Southampton, then to Pershore in Worcestershire, and then to Balsall Heath in Birmingham. In 1903 they moved again to Wimbledon in London. Throughout his boyhood George Bell endured a succession of schools, but in 1896 he was awarded a place at Westminster School. This placed him in the heart of the London of power and eminence the school represented.<br>
<br>In 1901 Bell went with a number of peers to study at Christ Church, Oxford. At first his religious beliefs were, in his own words, &#145;suspended&#146;  (Jasper, 17). He was not a man of abstractions and doctrines; he was drawn by the holiness of great souls. The essentially humane quality of his intelligence was confirmed and matured. He secured a first class in classical moderations in 1903, but two years later missed another in Greats. He liked poetry above all, editing five anthologies for the publishing house Routledge (newly acquired by the father of a friend), and winning the Newdigate prize for a poem entitled <span class="italic">Delphi</span>.<br>
<br>In April 1906 Bell went to Wells Theological College for a year, and here he discovered ecumenism. Soon he led weekly services to pray for the unity of the church. He was ordained deacon in Ripon Cathedral in 1907 and then priest a year later in Leeds parish church. It was in Leeds that he served his curacy, encountering the austerities of urban working-class life and labour and sharing them, even to the cost of his own health. Although he returned to Christ Church, first as a tutor and lecturer, and then as a student, Leeds had left its mark. Every now and then he disappeared with groups of students up to Leeds and Liverpool. His commitment to social justice grew in the company of Albert Mansbridge, Henry Scott Holland (by now also at Christ Church), and a brilliant young fellow of Queen's, William Temple. Bell lectured for the university extension movement and supported a number of socially concerned local bodies. His room, above the junior common room, became a centre for vigorous discussion, &#145;as living a &#147;cell&#148;&#146;, recorded a friend, provocatively, &#145;as would have contented the reddest communist&#146;  (Jasper, 13). Theological disputes, of which there were many in the Oxford of his day, did not much draw him. &#145;Christianity&#146;, he simply responded, &#145;is a life before it is a system and to lay too much stress on the system destroys the life&#146;  (ibid., 17).<br>
<br>By 1914 two of the great commitments of Bell's life had become explicit: the young ecumenical movement and the work of the church in a world of political and social injustice. In that year Archbishop Davidson required a new domestic chaplain, and he chose Bell. With characteristic caution Bell hesitated, sought advice, and accepted. It was a turning point. This new role he made his own, growing in confidence and watching the world of institutional responsibility sensitively and minutely in what became almost at once an age of international conflict. Davidson was not obviously one to inspire the idealist, but Bell's loyalty to him contained an element of devotion and in time he became his respectful biographer. The Davidson of that epic, two-volume work was a Christian statesman who played an active and influential role in the life of the state, both sustaining and condemning government policies in peace and wartime. At Lambeth, Bell's ecumenical concerns also flourished. In 1919 he went to Oud Wassenar in Holland to view the beginning of the new, post-war World Alliance for International Friendship through the Churches. There he met Archbishop S&ouml;derblom, its leading light, and was fired by his vision (S&ouml;derblom was equally impressed by Bell). At the 1920 Lambeth conference he worked hard on the famous &#145;Appeal to all Christian people&#146;, at once regarded as the defining statement of that gathering.<br>
<br>A Lambeth chaplaincy was often in the twentieth century seen to be a strong foundation for an eminent career in the Church of England, and Bell's abilities were both confirmed and extended by his role there. On 8 January 1918 he married Henrietta Millicent Grace (<i>d</i>. 1968), daughter of Canon R. J. Livingstone and sister of Sir Richard Livingstone. There were no children. In 1924 Ramsay MacDonald offered Bell the deanery of Canterbury and he accepted it. He was now forty-one. His predecessor had been eighty-seven. To Canterbury he brought change, encouraging visitors, writing guides, and abolishing fees. The broadcasting of services was encouraged and became regular. Visiting preachers from different traditions appeared in the pulpit. His sense of Christian worship was reverent, orderly, and beautiful in language. He took advice from choirboys on the length of services and confronted those who resisted change with a quiet tenacity.<br>
<br>Responsible for the life of a great church, Bell also found that he was able to put his love of literature and art to good effect. In 1928 John Masefield's play <span class="italic">The Coming of Christ</span> was performed in the cathedral; it was widely judged to be the first dramatic performance to take place in an English cathedral since the middle ages. In time he encouraged the contributions of young writers whose work would be seen to characterize the culture of the period: Charles Williams, Dorothy Sayers, Christopher Hassall, and Christopher Fry. After 1929, when he was consecrated bishop of Chichester, he continued to develop a relationship with the arts, and not always in his new diocese. From T. S. Eliot he commissioned <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span> for the Canterbury festival in 1935. He also commissioned the work of artists in the diocese. Bell was a strong and committed diocesan bishop. At Chichester itself he worked successfully and respectfully with two impressive deans, A. S. Duncan-Jones, who shared his commitment to German affairs, and Walter Hussey, who proved a bold partner in the commissioning of new art.<br>
<br>Bell was a member of the 1935 commission on church and state, a body set up in response to the prayer book crisis of 1927&#150;8. Although its report subsequently sank without trace, it confirmed Bell's reputation as a bishop concerned with the outward life of the Church of England and with its relationship with the political society it inhabited. By now his ecumenism was primarily international, and it was increasingly defined by the political dangers of the period. In 1928&#150;30 he fostered three series of theological discussions between leading British and German theologians of the day. These produced a succession of articles which did something to build a bridge between the thinkers of two very different protestant communities. He became a leading light in the new life and work movement, an ecumenical body devoted to the relationship between Christian faith and public life. Between 1932 and 1934 he was chairman of its council and subsequently chaired its administrative committee until 1938.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span> was, in part, a response to the stark realities of national socialism in Germany. Bell's participation in the German crisis after Hitler came to power in January 1933 became increasingly intense. He worked as an ally of those he perceived to be withstanding the onslaught of tyranny and also as a friend of those who were the victims of National Socialist policy. His vision of Christian mission and responsibility was marked by a new urgency and breadth. He spent numberless hours reading reports from Germany and discussing the situation with ecumenical contacts. In 1934 he became a close friend of the young German pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer, then responsible for the German congregation in Sydenham. He devised plans to settle refugees in his diocese and across Great Britain. Advised that those defined as non-Aryan Christians in Germany needed support still more than Jews or Christians he campaigned for them vigorously, organizing a succession of national campaigns. His maiden speech in the House of Lords in 1938 was on their behalf. In these matters he was deftly supported by a sympathetic archbishop, Cosmo Gordon Lang. Meanwhile, Bell's personal diplomacy showed an astute, even creative, ability to draw on the privileges of his status and to place them at the service of those who might seem marginal or powerless. &#145;What would suit me best of all&#146;, he once wrote to Bonhoeffer, &#145;would be if you could come and have breakfast with me at the Athenaeum at 9 o' clock on Thursday morning. Is that too outrageous?&#146;  (Bell MSS, vol. 42, fol. 18, 24 Feb 1934).<br>
<br>Bell was an unlikely campaigner. His was not a striking public presence; his voice was gentle and rather high. He had little feel for the pungent generalizations of rhetoric. More important to him were the intricate facts that lay behind complicated issues. In a world of propaganda and confrontation he perceived that credibility and influence grew above all out of exactitude. Denunciations were rarely, to his mind, influential, though his language became increasingly condemnatory as the decade unfolded and the international situation deteriorated. Like most church leaders, he supported the appeasement policy of Chamberlain because he believed that only peace could bring change while war must bring only destruction. Thereafter, his belief that war would do more to justify and sustain Hitler in power than peace was more unusual.<br>
<br>It was during the war against Germany that Bell acquired a reputation for provocation and controversy. He acted as an emissary for Germans dedicated to the removal of the Hitler regime in June 1942, after meeting for the last time his friend Bonhoeffer in neutral Sweden. The foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, sarcastically referred to him as &#145;this pestilent priest&#146;, and suspected him of pacifism. For its determined refusal to offer explicit encouragement to resistance circles in Germany Bell never forgave the British government, holding it partly responsible for the calamitous failure of the coup attempt of 20 July 1944. That a Christian bishop could effectively work on behalf of a political conspiracy to assassinate the head of a European state remains a striking fact. Meanwhile, in the House of Lords he did all he could to combat the words of Lord Vansittart, who argued that national socialism was the expression of German character and that any distinction between the Nazis and the Germans was simple foolishness. But there was more. The development of British air policy during the war alarmed him. In February 1944 he attacked the government in the House of Lords in a speech which combined military insight (he was advised by the military historian Sir Basil Liddell Hart) with moral force. But he was more and more to be seen in sympathy not with the main body of opinion, but on the fringe. It was not difficult to find Christians who denied the weight of such views&#151;Archbishop William Temple, for one.<br>
<br>That he did not become archbishop of Canterbury on Temple's death in 1944 has occasioned some debate, but the roots of this lay not merely in Bell's political controversialism in wartime, but in his commitment to issues that were not so much institutional as humanitarian. In this sense Geoffrey Fisher's appointment in succession to Temple foreshadowed a growing tendency in the church to concentrate primarily on its own affairs and to organize its structures more efficiently.<br>
<br>After the destruction of national socialism Bell visited Germany and inspired a number of German pastors to write what became known as the Stuttgart declaration of guilt. He protested publicly against the explosion of the first atomic bomb and remained a critic of nuclear weapons in the new cold war. He was elected moderator of the central committee of the new World Council of Churches at its first assembly in Amsterdam in August&#150;September 1948. In 1954 Bell became a president of the organization. His reputation among Christians in many countries grew impressively, and he was a committed friend of the new Church of South India. He remained bishop of Chichester until announcing his retirement on 4 June 1957, and died soon afterwards, at 1 Starrs House, The Precincts, Canterbury, on 3 October 1958. The burdens of the age weighed heavily upon Bell to the end. &#145;I cannot grieve for his going&#146;, his widow told a young friend, &#145;he felt so much for all that was happening in the world&#146;  (Chandler, 459). George Bell's ashes were interred by St Richard's altar in Chichester Cathedral, a week after his death. The location is nicely suggestive: at the very centre of the great church, but unobtrusive, and rarely noticed by the passing eye.<br>
<br>The significance of Bell's contribution to the Church of England, to the ecumenical movement, and to the age he inhabited is inevitably difficult to judge. The conviction that Christianity required a commitment to political affairs, an enduring characteristic of British Christian experience in the twentieth century, was certainly fortified by his vision. His written works retain some power. <span class="italic">Christianity and World Order</span> (1940) was the first theological book to be written expressly for publication as a paperback and it sold more than 80,000 copies. This and an edition of his wartime speeches, <span class="italic">The Church and Humanity</span> (1946), bring together the best, the most urgent, of his moral prophecy.<br>
