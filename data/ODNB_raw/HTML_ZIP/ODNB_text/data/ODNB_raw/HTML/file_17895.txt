<span class="headword">Malone,  Edmund</span>  (1704&#150;1774), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born in Dublin on 16 April 1704, the second son of Richard Malone (1674&#150;1745), who originally lived in Baronston, co. Westmeath, and his wife, Marcella, daughter of Redmond Molady. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17894/', "Anthony Malone (1700&#150;1776)")</script>, politician, was his brother. Educated in Dublin, Edmund Malone arrived in London in 1722 to study law at the Middle Temple. He was called to the English bar on 16 May 1729 and was student of the Inner Temple in 1734. Having established himself as a successful barrister, Malone married Catherine Collier (<i>d</i>. 1765), daughter of Benjamin Collier of Essex, on 26 May 1736. When Malone returned to Dublin in 1740, having been called to the Irish bar, he was already the father of <a href="#cosubject_17897">Richard (1738&#150;1816) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whose legal and political career followed a course similar to that of his father. In 1741 another son, Edmond (1741&#150;1812) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17896/', "Malone, Edmond")</script>], was born. Edmond entered the law before establishing himself as a noted Shakespearian critic. Malone fathered another four children, two of whom died in infancy. In Dublin, Malone was soon a respected and prosperous barrister, specializing in private litigation. He was sworn in as MP for Askeaton on 26 October 1753 and served until 1760. He was MP for Granard, co. Longford, from 1761 to 1766, but his political career came to an end soon after the death of his wife and he returned to London as a judge in the court of common pleas in 1767. His other appointments included bencher of the Honorable Society of King's Inns (1767&#150;74), commissioner to hear and determine causes in chancery, in the absence of, or on the death of the lord chancellor (1768&#150;74), and commissioner of bankruptcy appointed by the lord chancellor (1772). He was awarded an honorary LLD from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1756 and given the freedom of the city of Cork in 1760.<br>
<br>Malone died on 22 April 1774, probably in London. Though overshadowed by his second son, Malone epitomizes the successful eighteenth-century professional gentleman.<br>
<br>Malone's first son, <a name="cosubject_17897"></a><span class="headword">Richard Malone</span>, Baron Sunderlin  (1738&#150;1816)<span class="occ"></span>, was educated at Dr Ford's school, before entering Trinity College, Dublin, on 18 October 1755. He was student at the Inner Temple, London, in 1757 and graduated BA from Trinity College in 1759 before being incorporated of Christ Church, Oxford, in Michaelmas term that same year. He was called to the Irish bar in 1767. In 1776 he inherited the estates of his uncle Anthony Malone (1700&#150;1776), including Baronston, co. Westmeath, and in 1778 he married Philippa Elizabeth Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rooper (1745&#150;1831), eldest daughter of Godolphin Rooper (1709&#150;1790) of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (<i>d</i>. 1793), daughter of Timothy Harris. Made sheriff of co. Westmeath in 1780, in 1783 Malone bought a seat in the Irish House of Commons and served as MP for Banagher until 30 June 1785, when he was raised to the Irish peerage as Lord Sunderlin. He was further created Baron Sunderlin of Baronstonin 1797. In the House of Lords, Malone sought appointment to the privy council without success. Little is known of his life after 1788, but as his brother Edmond's executor he bequeathed many of the Shakespearian scholar's books to the Bodleian Library. Richard Malone died on 14 April 1816, probably at Baronston.<br>
