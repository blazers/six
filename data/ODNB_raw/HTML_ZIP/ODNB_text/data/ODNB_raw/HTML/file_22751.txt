<span class="headword">Price <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Higginbotham]</span>,  James</span>  (1757/8&#150;1783), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, son of James and Margaret Higginbotham, was born in London. He entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1772, graduating MA in 1777. In 1781 he changed his name to Price, in accordance with the will of a relative who had bequeathed him a fortune. On 10 May 1781 he was elected to the Royal Society, having been described on the certificate of recommendation by Richard Kirwan, who headed the list of proposers, as &#145;well versed in various branches of Natural Philosophy, and particularly in Chymistry&#146;  (Royal Society election certificate, Royal Society Archives, London). On 2 July 1782 the degree of MD was conferred on him by the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>Between 6 May and 25 May 1782 Price performed, at Stoke, near Guildford, experiments which appeared to show that he possessed a white powder and a red powder capable of converting mercury into silver and gold respectively, the substances being heated together in a crucible with a flux of borax. The witnesses included lords Onslow, King, and Palmerston, and other men of social, though not scientific, rank. The gold and silver alleged to be produced were found genuine on assay.<br>
<br>Price related the experiments in detail in <span class="italic">An account of some experiments on mercury, silver and gold, made in Guildford in May, 1782, in the laboratory of James Price, M.D., F.R.S.</span> (1782). The experiments were the subject of a correspondence between Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, and his close friend Charles Blagden, initiated by Banks on 14 July 1782 with a letter telling Blagden of the anger of Richard Kirwan and other chemists caused by &#145;such an apparent charlatanism&#146;  (Royal Society Archives, BLA b.8). A letter written by Blagden, however, shows that he thought it possible that Price had made a genuine discovery. Although alchemy was regarded as discredited by Price's chemist contemporaries, prevailing chemical theories did not preclude the possibility of transmuting metals. Blagden was particularly incensed by the award to Price of the degree of MD by Oxford, assuming like many others that it had been conferred for his apparent success in transmutation. &#145;Was ever any country more disgraced than ours has been by the conduct of our University?&#146;, he wrote. If Price had made the discovery he claimed without revealing it to his colleagues, he continued, he deserved to be excluded from their society, not &#145;to be adorned [with] extraordinary academical honours&#146;  (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, Archives, H 165). Price later insisted that the award of the degree was for former work in chemistry.<br>
<br>In the preface to his account, Price had declared that his stock of the powders was exhausted, and that the cost of replenishment would be too great in labour and health for him to undertake it. Nevertheless it was made clear to him that he must repeat his experiments in the presence of scientific colleagues, Banks, in particular, reminding him that the honour of the society was at stake as well as his own. Early in 1783, having tried to obtain information in Germany of alchemical processes, Price apparently worked incessantly for six weeks, attempting to verify his claims. In March he prepared a concentrated infusion of laurel leaves (which would contain hydrocyanic acid) and made his will. According to Chambers's <span class="italic">The Book of Days</span> (1863) he drank this in the presence of the three colleagues who alone came to the laboratory at his invitation on a day in early August which he had appointed for a demonstration. This has usually been repeated in subsequent accounts of Price's suicide. It is, however, difficult to discount the probability of an alternative version in a letter dated 30 September 1783, to an editor of the <span class="italic">G&ouml;ttingisches Magazin</span>  (3. 886&#150;9) who had earlier published an abstract of Price's book in the journal. The unnamed writer from London, who seemed well informed and went into considerable detail, stated that Price was alone when he drank the poison, no one having accepted his invitation to attend the laboratory that day. Price was buried at St John's Church in the parish of Stoke-next-Guildford, where a memorial gives the date of his death as 31 July.<br>
