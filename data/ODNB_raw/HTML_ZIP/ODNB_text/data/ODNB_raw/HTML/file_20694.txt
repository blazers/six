<span class="headword">Oldisworth,  William</span>  (1680&#150;1734), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was the son of the Revd William Oldisworth, vicar of Itchen Stoke, Hampshire, and prebendary of Middleton, in Winchester. The family was traditionally royalist, and came from Gloucestershire, where many of Oldisworth's relations had been Anglican clergymen and country squires. Oldisworth matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, on 4 April 1698. During his time at university he was associated with the Christ Church wits, and came into contact with the poet Edmund Smith, and with Francis Atterbury, later bishop of Rochester. After leaving Oxford, without having taken his degree, he worked as a clerk for his uncle, a JP in Hampshire, and then moved to London about 1706, where he began his writing career. His first significant publication was his three-volume <span class="italic">A Dialogue between Timothy and Philatheus</span> (1709&#150;11), a response to Matthew Tindal's assault on revealed religion in <span class="italic">The Rights of the Christian Church Asserted</span> (1706). In the <span class="italic">Dialogue</span>, Oldisworth linked Tindal with other notorious freethinkers. He continued this engagement in religious controversy with another pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Exeter</span> (1709), in which he defended the high-church Bishop Blackall against attacks by Benjamin Hoadly.<br>
<br>Oldisworth was reputed to be a fine translator, and in 1712, he, along with William Broome, contributed to John Ozell's five-volume translation of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>. This was followed, in 1712&#150;13, by a parodic version of Horace's odes, in which he translated Richard Bentley's edition of Horace, providing satirical notes on Bentley's lengthy annotations to his edition. However, he is most famous for his role in the continuation of the tory periodical <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>. Between 1711 and 1714, he was the main contributor to the publication, which had previously been edited by Jonathan Swift and Delarivier Manley. <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> brought him financial stability, and support from prominent tories, including Robert Harley. However, following the death of Queen Anne this involvement ceased, and Oldisworth adopted a more direct form of political action, travelling north in the autumn of 1715 to join the Scottish Jacobites at the battle of Preston. Although contemporary reports claimed that he was killed in action, Oldisworth survived the battle, and may have then gone to seek refuge in Paris along with other Jacobites. His whereabouts for the next five years are unknown, but he appears to have returned to Oxford at some point in the early 1720s, where he took up antiquarian scholarship. He assisted Richard Fiddes in his life of Cardinal Wolsey, and studied various Middle English texts, including <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>. At this time, between 1723 and 1724, he also seems to have been a contributor to the duke of Wharton's tory paper, the <span class="italic">True Briton</span>. His last serious piece of writing was his translation of a sixteenth-century Latin work by Wawrzyniec Goslicki, bishop of Posen, <span class="italic">The Accomplished Senator</span> (1733), in which he emphasized the moderation and independence of his own political position, in order to counter his reputation as a political extremist. Although Oldisworth had achieved financial security through his writing, he was rendered destitute in the early 1730s, apparently by the sudden bankruptcy of a relative. He was imprisoned for debt and he died on 15 September 1734 in the king's bench prison, London.<br>
