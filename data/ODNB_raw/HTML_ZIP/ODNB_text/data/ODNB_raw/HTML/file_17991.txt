<span class="headword">Mansell,  Francis</span>  (1579&#150;1665), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Muddlescombe, Carmarthenshire, and baptized on 23 March 1579, the third son of Sir Francis Mansell and his first wife, Catherine, daughter and heir of Henry Morgan of Muddlescombe. After attending the free school in Hereford, he matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 20 November 1607. He graduated BA on 20 February 1609 and proceeded MA on 5 July 1611. In 1613 he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls as founder's kin.<br>
<br>On the death of Griffith Powell on 28 June 1620, Mansell was elected principal of Jesus College, and was admitted by the vice-chancellor, in spite of opposition from a number of fellows. On 13 July Mansell expelled three of his opponents from their fellowships and proceeded, on the authority of the vice-chancellor, against a fourth. His position does not appear to have been secure, however, and before his year of grace from All Souls expired he resigned from the principalship and retired to his fellowship, proceeding BD and DD on 3 July 1624. When his successor at Jesus, Sir Eubule Thelwall, died on 8 October 1630, Mansell was re-elected, his success on this occasion perhaps a result of the patronage of William Laud, the new chancellor. In the same year he became rector of Easington, Oxfordshire, and in 1631 rector of Elmley Chapel, Kent, prebendary of St David's and treasurer of Llandaff.<br>
<br>During Mansell's second tenure of office Jesus College buildings were altered and enlarged. In 1636&#150;7 the chapel was extended westwards. Thelwall's new library, raised on a colonnade which was insufficiently strong, was pulled down and the north and south sides of the inner quadrangle were completed. Mansell was a tireless fund-raiser and gave much of his own money to the college, including &pound;100 towards the second quadrangle.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1642 Mansell was in Wales settling the details of some benefactions. He returned to Oxford at the end of the year but in 1643 was forced to leave the city to look after the affairs of his brother Anthony, who had been killed at the battle of Newbury. For the next few years he rallied support for the royalists in Wales. He was sequestered from his Kent rectory before 4 March 1646 but on 11 June that year was one of those clergy whom the House of Commons wished to secure in some suitable place. When the parliamentary visitation of the university began in 1647 he returned to Oxford to look after college interests, and although ejected from the principalship in May 1648, took a year to ensure that the college's affairs were in order before handing over to his successor, Michael Roberts.<br>
<br>Mansell then retired to Llantriddyd, Glamorgan, where he encountered some harassment. In 1651 he again returned to Oxford, residing with a Mr Newman, a baker in Holywell Street. He found employment teaching a small group of sons of Welsh gentry at the home of a Mr White, which received the nickname &#145;little Welsh hall&#146;. Later invited to take rooms in Jesus College, he resumed tutorial duties, teaching among others the young Sackville Crowe. In letters to Crowe's father Mansell advocated a broad curriculum for all commoners, not just those destined for the church or for academe.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, on 1 August 1660 Mansell was reinstated as principal of Jesus. However, age and bad eyesight induced him to resign the following year, and having gradually become more infirm, he died on 1 May 1665. He requested burial in the college chapel, where a memorial was placed. By his will dated 3 January 1661, he left small bequests to the poor of parishes in Carmarthenshire and Glamorgan, and the residue of his estate to his friend, executor, and successor at Jesus, Leoline Jenkins, in trust for the benefit of the college and of the church in Wales.<br>
