<span class="headword">Pirrie,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1807, <em>d.</em> 1882), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the son of George Pirrie, a farmer, and Jean Bruce, was born in the parish of Gartly, near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and was baptized there on 15 July 1807. He was educated at Gartly parish school; at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA in 1825; at the University of Edinburgh, where in 1829 he graduated MD with a thesis entitled &#145;De vitiis tali&#146;, and also became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons; and in Paris, where he studied surgery under Baron Dupuytren.<br>
<br>After returning to Aberdeen in 1830 Pirrie was appointed lecturer on anatomy and physiology in the joint Aberdeen medical schools of Marischal and of King's College. On the separation of the schools in 1839 he became the first regius professor of surgery at Marischal; and when they were again united by parliamentary act in 1859 he continued to teach as professor of surgery in the University of Aberdeen. He was also for a great many years, until his retirement in 1880, surgeon to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. In 1875 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD, and in 1877 he was made surgeon in Scotland to the prince of Wales. Pirrie was married to Mary Rose Matthews, who survived him. They had four daughters and four sons.<br>
<br>Holding office for fifty-two years, Pirrie was well known to three generations of Aberdeen medical students, his portly figure and somewhat assertive manner, together with his fondness for recalling his Parisian experiences under Dupuytren, winning him the sobriquet of &#145;the baron&#146;. His lectures were essentially demonstrative, and he possessed a great ability to inspire enthusiasm in his audience. To him and to his colleague in the chair of anatomy, John Struthers, is due the credit of establishing the high reputation of the Aberdeen medical school, which had never been so well attended as at his death. Pirrie was also instrumental in encouraging his old schoolfellow and friend Sir Erasmus Wilson to found the chair of pathology in the university in 1882.<br>
<br>An intrepid and successful surgeon, Pirrie, during the latter half of his career, was widely known as the foremost surgeon in the north of Scotland, with a practice that was so successful that he became a household name in the region. In order to do all his work he would often be in his study by four in the morning, and might begin his visits by seven. He published, in addition to numerous contributions to the medical journals, a treatise entitled <span class="italic">The Principles and Practice of Surgery</span> (1852) which passed through several editions and which remained for many years a standard textbook; and, with William Keith, <span class="italic">Acupressure, an excellent method of arresting surgical haemorrhage and of accelerating the healing of wounds</span> (1867).<br>
<br>Pirrie resigned his chair in the summer of 1882, and died at 253 Union Street, Aberdeen, on 21 November in the same year, having worked until the preceding month. At his funeral a crowd of some 30,000 were said to have been in attendance.<br>
