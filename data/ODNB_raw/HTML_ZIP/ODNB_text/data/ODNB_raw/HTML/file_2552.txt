<span class="headword">Blades,  William</span>  (1824&#150;1890), <span class="occ">printer and bibliographer</span>, was born on 5 December 1824, in Clapham, Surrey, the third son and the fifth of the nine children of Joseph Blades (<i>c</i>.1786&#150;<i>c</i>.1860) and his wife, Grace Hainsworth (1792&#150;1863). His parents were both English. His father and uncle were partners with Joseph East in the printing house of East and Blades, later Blades, East, and Blades, of Abchurch Lane. Blades was educated at Stockwell and Clapham grammar schools and bound apprentice to his father's firm on 1 May 1840.<br>
<br>The early 1850s were productive years: Blades was made a partner and in due course succeeded as senior partner in Blades, East, and Blades, which he ran with his younger brother, Rowland. Unusually for a working printer, he early developed an interest in printing history and furthered his education, in the midst of a busy working life, by forming a fine library; it was &#145;essentially a workshop and his books [were] his tools&#146;  (Reed). He began to concentrate on a study of Caxton. Not wanting to take anything on trust, he personally examined&#151;in libraries up and down the country and in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France&#151;more than 450 copies of the products of Caxton's press. His first publication was an introduction to a facsimile of Caxton's <span class="italic">Governayle of Helthe</span> of 1491 made from Lord Dysart's copy, printed by Blades, East, and Blades, in &#145;Types expressly cast in pewter&#146; (1858).<br>
<br>The firm specialized in security printing and Blades was able to command the highest standards for the production of all his books and use his contacts with lithographic artists and printers of top calibre, in particular the firm of G. F. Tupper &amp; Sons; the eldest son, George Isaac Frederick Tupper, was an outstandingly skilled lithographic &#145;writer&#146; who produced a lithographic frontispiece for the <span class="italic">Governayle of Helthe</span>. This fairly launched Blades on what would, but for business and family commitments, have become his life's work. He infected Tupper with his own enthusiasm and, in the course of tracing individual types and pages from Caxton's works, he made notes on Caxton's types which Blades used in <span class="italic">The Life and Typography of William Caxton</span> (1861 and 1863). Following Joseph Ames's seminal work in his <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities</span> (1749) on dating Caxton's works by their types, Blades classified them systematically in an attempt to assign dates to the undated works. With the help of Tupper, and of Henry Bradshaw at Cambridge, he identified six of the eight Caxton types known today. The biographical volume was based on original documents. Bradshaw was one of the most astute bibliographical minds of all time with as sharp an eye for type variants as Blades who was working with type all the time. Blades had sent Bradshaw a copy of the <span class="italic">Governayle of Helthe</span>, and in the years leading up to publication of the <span class="italic">Life and Typography</span> they wrote to each other almost daily on bibliographical subjects. Bradshaw had more leisure to pursue such niceties than Blades, who had to fit his Caxton studies into the interstices of a working printer's life and was soon to be married: &#145;What with business &amp; evenings lost in visiting future relations&#146;, he wrote on the eve of his marriage, &#145;&amp; the feeling that I am not taking pains enough to be correct in my Caxton articles I get quite savage sometimes&#146;  (Blades to Bradshaw, 6 Feb 1862). The amount of time he spent on Caxton was beginning to cause family friction and he was forced to press on faster than he wished with publication of volume 2 of his Caxton book: &#145;for the whole of [the last three months] I have almost entirely neglected my business which has annoyed my uncle &amp; Partner Mr East, and which if continued much longer would lead to disagreeable results&#146;  (Blades to Bradshaw, 20 March 1862).<br>
<br>On 29 April 1862 Blades married Eliza Caroline Anne Fletcher (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1837). They had seven children. In the succeeding years Blades produced some more facsimile editions and became the acclaimed authority on Caxton, but he published nothing comparable to his <span class="italic">Life and Typography</span> apart from a slim pamphlet, <span class="italic">How to Tell a Caxton</span> (1870), which took account for the first time of Jan Veldener, who cut most of Caxton's types. The one-volume octavo revision of his great work, the <span class="italic">Biography and Typography of William Caxton, England's First Printer</span>, which he published for Caxton's quatercentenary in 1877, has been criticized for failing to include many of Bradshaw's corrections to the earlier work. Professional jealousy may have played some part but the truth is that Blades, as he confessed to Bradshaw, had lost his youthful impetus; &#145;I am hard at work digesting my quarto volumes into an 8vo &hellip; but find it harder to work satisfactorily than I did 14 years ago&#151;neither body nor mind will stand it&#146;  (Blades to Bradshaw, 23 Nov 1876).<br>
<br>Blades was also deeply involved in the organization of a Caxton quatercentenary exhibition on the development of printing, a venture conceived as part charitable and part educational; it was intended to raise funds for the Printers' Pension, Almshouse and Orphan Asylum Corporation as well as introducing the working man to fine books on the one hand and showing the latest printing machines and technological developments in printing on the other. Blades threw himself into it heart and soul, procuring for the exhibition some 5000 books, type specimens, letters, and ephemera, loaned by nearly 300 owners and libraries. He wrote 286 letters to owners, helped to put up the display, and wrote one entire section of the massive catalogue.<br>
<br>Later Blades turned to collecting trade tokens in the tradition of coin and medal collecting of earlier centuries&#151;later considered of little academic account. He published several works on printers' tokens, the most important being <span class="italic">Numismata typographica, or, The medallic history of printing, being an account of the medals, jettons, and tokens struck in commemoration of printers and the art of printing</span> (1883). His most popular work, <span class="italic">The Enemies of Books</span>, light-hearted in a heavy Victorian way, went into six editions between 1881 and 1886. He continued to take an active interest in bibliography, was a founder of the Library Association in 1877, read papers at several of its annual meetings, and published a series of bibliographical miscellanies (1890). He also helped to found the Bibliographical Society but died before it came into being in 1892.<br>
<br>The world of printing and London civic affairs claimed an increasing part of Blades's time. He was a liveryman of the Scriveners' Company and was involved in the affairs of Candlewick ward, in which his business premises stood. He had progressive views on improving working conditions in the trade and encouraged a strong trade union in his firm. In the early 1880s the works moved to five-storey premises in Appold Street, Finsbury Pavement, London. It was a showplace with the most up-to-date equipment until the whole building was gutted by fire in 1886 and they had to move again, this time to a smaller, four-storey building.<br>
<br>William Blades died on 27 April 1890 at Suffolk House, Clear Road, Sutton, Surrey; his wife survived him. After his death his extensive library formed the foundation collection of the St Bride Printing Library. Two of his sons followed him into the business. Blades's enduring claim to fame rests on his pioneering use of type identification as a method of dating undated early books, a method still used by incunabulists at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<br>
