<span class="headword">Walker <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Bellenie,  Bellenie-Walker]</span>,  William Robert</span>  (1869&#150;1918), <span class="occ">diver</span>, was born William Robert Bellenie on 21 October 1869 at 124 Hill Street, Walworth, Surrey, one of four sons and one daughter in the family of William John Bellenie, a carpenter of Italian ancestry, and his wife, Frances Jane Rose. As an adult William Robert changed his surname by deed poll to Bellenie-Walker, and later shortened it to Walker at the request of his second wife.<br>
<br>Walker joined the Royal Navy as a boy entrant aged sixteen, and in 1887 he started training as a deep-sea diver at HMS <i>Vernon</i>, graduating as a first-class diver. During this period he gave the future George V, then a cadet, his first lesson in diving. In 1892 Walker left the navy to become an employee of the diving firm Siebe Gorman &amp; Co. of Westminster Bridge Road, London. He worked for four years in Gibraltar on the new dockyard, and, as his skill was recognized, was in constant demand to deal with flooded coal and lead mines, and to undertake wreck work. He participated in experiments for his firm, whose doctors were collaborating with Admiralty physicians on the subject of underwater pressure, and he made a near record dive to 189 feet. Walker was working on a new jetty at the Victoria docks, London, when he was sent to Winchester Cathedral for the five-year project for which he was to achieve national fame.<br>
<br>The repair works at Winchester had begun in November 1905 under the direction of Thomas Jackson, then diocesan architect, and the consultant engineer Francis Fox. A decision had been made to underpin the cathedral by digging a random series of trenches (drifts) at right angles to the cathedral walls and replacing the inadequate medieval footings by cement concrete, down to the solid gravel 24 feet below ground level. The high water table in Winchester (only 10 feet below the surface) meant that a powerful pump was initially used in an attempt to empty the drifts; this was felt to be hazardous as there was a risk of removing solid material from beneath the cathedral walls. Progress was slow, and the problems were resolved only at the end of March 1906, when Francis Fox suggested that the initial stages of the underpinning work might be done under water, using a diver and obviating the need for pumping. Walker and another diver began work in Winchester within a week. It was intended that they should work alternate shifts, using one set of equipment, but Walker's output and skill proved far superior to that of his colleague who eventually was taken off the project.<br>
<br>Walker quickly achieved popular renown as the key figure in the preservation operation at Winchester, in which up to 150 other workmen were involved. He worked for two four-hour shifts a day, which allowed time for two three-hour periods under water. There, in almost total darkness caused by the turbidity of the water, Walker worked at a depth of some 15&#150;20 feet, completing the excavation of the drifts, and laying two to three layers of bags of cement concrete, which sealed the ingress of water from below. It was then possible to pump out the drift so that masons could complete the underpinning. Eventually the foundations of all the outer walls of the cathedral were renewed in this way.<br>
<br>Walker's work at Winchester was completed by August 1911. On 15 July 1912, St Swithun's day, the preservation works were commemorated by a service of national thanksgiving, attended by the king and queen. Walker was present at the service and received an honourable mention in the sermon given by the archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, who presented Walker to George V after the service. His former pupil congratulated him &#145;upon [his] feat in saving the Cathedral&#146;  (Henderson and Crook, 118). At the end of 1912 Walker was made a member of the Royal Victorian Order, an honour in the gift of the sovereign.<br>
<br>Walker was a robust man. His job required considerable stamina, and he scarcely lost a day's work through ill health, attributing this to the pipe which he regularly smoked in silence between shifts, claiming that it preserved him from the harmful effects of working in ground then considered to be infected by 900-year-old graves. He returned each weekend to his family home at South Norwood, on one occasion making the journey by bicycle. A modest man, he spoke little about his exploits, despite constant media attention.<br>
<br>Walker was a Freemason: a member of the Royal Jubilee Lodge, and grand master of Malta. He married Hannah, daughter of Thomas John Cashman, a scaffolder, of Cork. The marriage produced five children, the last, Edward, being born in Gibraltar in 1900 while Walker was working in the dockyard there. Hannah died within a year of Edward's birth, and Walker sent the young family home to the care of Hannah's younger sister, Alice, then aged nineteen. On the children's arrival Alice discovered that two of them had contracted typhoid fever during the voyage home. She nursed them back to health and married their father on 30 December 1907. Seven children resulted from this second marriage.<br>
<br>On 27 October 1918 Walker fell victim to the Spanish influenza epidemic, and died on 30 October of acute lobar pneumonia at his home, 112 Portland Road, South Norwood. He was buried in Elmers End cemetery, Beckenham. He was survived by his second wife. In 1964 a statuette of a diver by Sir Charles Wheeler was unveiled in Winchester Cathedral in honour of the man who had &#145;saved the cathedral with his own two hands&#146;  (Henderson and Crook, 126); owing to a confusion the effigy was in fact modelled on a photograph of Francis Fox in diver's dress. In 1989 Walker's neglected grave was restored by public subscription. In June 2001 the error over the diver's memorial was finally corrected when a bronze portrait bust of Walker by Glyn Williams was unveiled. Walker is remembered annually at Winchester Cathedral's patronal festival.<br>
