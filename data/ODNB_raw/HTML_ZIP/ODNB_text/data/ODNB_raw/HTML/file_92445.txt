<span class="headword">Sais, Sir  Gregory</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1390), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was a native of Flintshire and probably a son of Cynwrig Sais ab Ithel Fychan (<i>d</i>. 1348?); his father and his brother Ithel had both earned a reputation for oppressive behaviour in the county as leading servants of Edward the Black Prince. In 1360 he was captain of Beaumont-le-Vicomte in Maine and in the following year he sought the pope's permission to visit the holy sepulchre &#145;and other sacred places on either side of the sea&#146; with a retinue of fifty persons  (Bliss, no. 375). About this time he appears to have commanded a free company; a pilgrimage would have been good cover for a company moving through France. Froissart suggests that Sais had been knighted by 1367, when he joined the Black Prince's expedition to Castile in support of Pedro the Cruel. He was taken prisoner after a skirmish at Ari&ntilde;ez near Vitoria, but was probably released after the prince's victory at N&aacute;jera on 3 April.<br>
<br>Anglo-French hostilities resumed in 1369, but for the English the war was now a long drawn-out rearguard action as the French gradually recovered the south-west. Sir Gregory's service between 1369 and 1374 was here; he served with Sir Simon Burley in Poitou and Saintonge, with Sir Robert Knolles in the Agenais and Quercy, and with Sir John Chandos in Anjou and Touraine. In 1370 he was one of the captains with the ailing Black Prince at the siege and sack of Limoges, one of the worst atrocities in medieval European warfare.<br>
<br>The next two years saw the expulsion of the English from Poitou and Saintonge. Poitiers surrendered to the French on 7 July 1372 and Sais, with several other knights, retreated to Niort. Early in 1373 the nearby town of Chiz&eacute; was being besieged by Bertrand du Guesclin; a relief column was defeated by the French on 21 March and Sir Gregory was again taken prisoner. He must have been freed soon afterwards, since he appears to have defended the castle of Gen&ccedil;ay in Poitou for another two years. He had been granted Gen&ccedil;ay and Montmorillon by the Black Prince and he had also acquired Mortemer by his marriage to a Poitevin heiress, Ragonde B&eacute;chet, the widow of its lord, Gui S&eacute;n&eacute;chal. The siege of Gen&ccedil;ay ended when du Guesclin offered Sir Gregory terms that included the protection of the rights and property of his wife and his stepdaughter, but in 1376 Gen&ccedil;ay and Mortemer were granted by Charles V to the duc de Berry.<br>
<br>Sir Gregory and Ragonde returned to England at some time between 1375 and 1377. They received compensation for their losses in France; in 1378 he was granted &pound;200 a year for life, while she would have 200 marks a year during her widowhood should she survive him. On 26 April 1377 he was ordered to survey, repair, fortify, and garrison the castles of Tenby, Pembroke, Cilgerran, Manorbier, Carew, Picton, and Newport, since an invasion of Wales, particularly of the county and lordship of Pembroke, was being planned. This was probably connected with the activities of Owen of Wales; in 1377 an English deserter called John Minsterworth was executed for conspiring with the Welsh pretender, who was himself murdered a year later.<br>
<br>Between 1378 and 1381 Sais was lieutenant of Brest under the captaincy of Sir Hugh Calveley and Sir Thomas Percy; this was followed in December 1383 by his appointment as captain of the town of Berwick. Among the men-at-arms serving under him were Owain Glyn D&#373;r and his brother Tudur, along with several other Welshmen. His final command was the keepership of Queenborough Castle in the Isle of Sheppey in December 1387. By then he had renewed his connection with his native county, having been given licence to acquire lands worth up to &pound;40 in north Wales, Cheshire, and Flintshire in June 1386. He brought an action of trespass against a neighbour in the same year, and he leased the court pleas and perquisites and the market and fair tolls of the town of Caerwys in 1388 and 1390; with his cousin Hywel ap Tudur ab Ithel Fychan he also leased the manor of Mostyn. The manor of Frodsham in Cheshire had been granted to Ragonde for life in 1385; when Sais died in 1390 he left lands in thirteen townships in that county. Ragonde was dead by 1409; there is no record that she and Sir Gregory had any children, although she had a daughter by an earlier marriage.<br>
<br>Sir Gregory Sais was a member of the circle of distinguished knights around the Black Prince, and earned a mention in Froissart's romance <span class="italic">M&eacute;liador</span>, in which the names of notable contemporary knights were used for the characters. He did not attain the fame of some of his brother knights, perhaps because so much of his service was in one of the less glamorous and successful theatres of the war. The way in which his name was so often mangled also meant that he was not always identified correctly; the fact that he was sometimes described as Dangouses led Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to describe him as the earl of Angus in his novel <span class="italic">The White Company</span> (1890). But Sais was the most distinguished Welsh soldier of his time and the poets knew of his exploits; Iolo Goch referred to Owain Glyn D&#373;r's service with him at Berwick, while Gruffudd Llwyd bemoaned the fact that he was one of only three Welshmen who had been knighted, the implication being that the same honour should have been bestowed on Owain.<br>
