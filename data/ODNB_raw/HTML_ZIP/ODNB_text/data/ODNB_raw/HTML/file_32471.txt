</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cochran, Sir  Charles Blake</span>  (1872&#150;1951), <span class="occ">impresario</span>, was born on 25 September 1872 at 15 Prestonville Road, Brighton, Sussex, the fourth of the nine children of James Elphinstone Cochran (1840&#150;1900), tea and cigar importer, and his wife, Matilda Arnold <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walton (1838&#150;1929), daughter of a merchant navy officer and the widowed mother of a son by her first marriage. At the age of seven Charles saw the pantomime <span class="italic">Sindbad the Sailor</span>. This first unforgettable visit inspired a lifelong passion for the theatre. At Brighton grammar school (1883&#150;8) his best friend was his contemporary Aubrey Beardsley; they shared an enthusiasm for acting and appeared at the Brighton Pavilion in a play written by Beardsley. Having left school and failed as a music-hall performer Cochran &#145;borrowed&#146; some petty cash from the office where he worked as a reluctant clerk and sailed for America. There he lived precariously on menial jobs and occasional acting engagements, ending up as secretary to the actor&#150;manager Richard Mansfield and gaining experience in running a theatrical company. After a brief disagreement with Mansfield he established an acting school in New York and launched his first theatrical production, Ibsen's <span class="italic">John Gabriel Borkman</span> (1897). Following a penniless interlude in London, he returned to Mansfield and organized his nationwide tour of <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span>.<br>
<br>Back in London again in 1899 Cochran set up as manager to such figures as Houdini and the wrestler Hackenschmidt. The plays he produced were unsuccessful and resulted in 1903 in his first bankruptcy. Undeterred, he bounced back as a promoter of freak shows at Olympia, of roller-skating, of midgets, and of performing fleas, which, alas, failed to perform. Having paused briefly to elope with Evelyn Alice Dade (1885&#150;1960) and to marry her in Covent Garden register office in 1905, he plunged back into his professional activities; these culminated in Max Reinhardt's spectacular production of <span class="italic">The Miracle</span> (1911) at Olympia, with a 200-strong orchestra and a chorus of 500. (Cochran later revived it with Lady Diana Cooper as the Madonna.) The next attraction he presented at Olympia was Carl Hagenbeck's giant zoo.<br>
<br>In 1914 at the Ambassador's Theatre Cochran took up the newly born genre of revue with <span class="italic">Odds and Ends</span>, starring his new discovery Alice Delysia. It set the standard of all his subsequent revues: beautiful dresses, taste, wit, elegance, brightness, and colour. This was followed by a series of glamorous entertainments, although he seasoned the mixture with &#145;problem&#146; plays by Eug&egrave;ne Brieux. His greatest wartime success was <span class="italic">The Better 'Ole</span> (1917), based on the cartoonist Bruce Bairnsfather's anti-hero Old Bill. At the London Pavilion, which he had leased and renovated, he mounted <span class="italic">As you were</span> (1918), again with Alice Delysia, and the shows that followed confirmed his reputation as a master of revue. He also promoted boxing matches featuring Wells, Beckett, and Carpentier. The murky underworld of boxing drove him into a nervous breakdown, and on recovery he took Suzanne Lenglen under his wing in an attempt to promote the gentler sport of lawn tennis. It failed, as did the sensational rodeo that he staged at Wembley in 1924. In 1925 he went bankrupt again. Such, however, was his persuasive charm that his creditors at the bankruptcy proceedings sang &#145;For he's a jolly good fellow&#146; and wished him well. In business again, Cochran organized ballroom-dancing displays and midnight cabarets. His partnership with No&euml;l Coward engendered <span class="italic">On with the Dance</span> (1925), <span class="italic">This Year of Grace</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Bitter Sweet</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Private Lives</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Cavalcade</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Words and Music</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Conversation Piece</span> (1934). Eventually, believing he had been denied his fair share of profits, Coward ended the relationship, although his subsequent musical shows never prospered as had those which enjoyed Cochran's magic touch.<br>
<br>Cochran was a master of publicity, one of his cleverest ideas being Mr Cochran's Young Ladies, a troupe of hand-picked beauties who numbered among them Anna Neagle and Florence Desmond. One of his most talented discoveries was Jessie Matthews (<span class="italic">One Dam' Thing After Another</span> by Rodgers and Hart, 1927, and <span class="italic">Ever Green</span>, 1930); another was the German Elisabeth Bergner (<span class="italic">Escape me Never</span>, 1933, and Barrie's last play, <span class="italic">The Boy David</span>, 1936); yet another was Evelyn Laye, whom he starred in <span class="italic">Helen!</span>, a lavish reworking of Offenbach's operetta (1932). The Second World War reduced his fortunes, although in 1946 he found renewed prosperity with <span class="italic">Big Ben</span>, a happy collaboration between A. P. Herbert and the gifted Vivian Ellis. They followed it with the joyous <span class="italic">Bless the Bride</span> (1947), the longest run (886 shows) that Cochran ever achieved&#151;although, quickly bored and ever keen on novelty, he took it off while it was still drawing full houses and replaced it with <span class="italic">Tough at the Top</span> (1949), which failed. After more than fifty years in the business he freely avowed that he was still unable to forecast public reaction to a new show. It was enough for him that it reached his own high standards. His optimism remained unquenched to the end. At any given moment he was juggling a half-dozen new productions and running the same number of theatres. He had Diaghilev's rare gift for discerning new talent and for blending authors, artists, designers, composers, and performers in a perfectly harmonious ensemble.<br>
<br>Although Cochran gloried in the title of showman, he was irritated when critics dismissed him as a commercial producer. He prefigured Peter Daubeny with his remarkable international seasons that brought to London Sarah Bernhardt, Eleonora Duse, the Guitrys, Pito&euml;ff, Pavlova, Chalyapin, the Diaghilev ballets, and the Chauve-Souris. The artists he commissioned included Augustus John, Bakst, B&eacute;rard, and Messel. His choreographers were Balanchine and Massine; his composers Walton, Sauguet, and Berners. He was also responsible for the London premi&egrave;res of O'Neill's <span class="italic">Anna Christie</span> (1923) and O'Casey's <span class="italic">The Silver Tassie</span> (1929). He was knighted in 1948 and elected to the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1950.<br>
<br>Cochran was short and red-faced, a well-fed country squire in appearance. He wore a bowler hat, a monocle, and elegant double-breasted suits, and leant heavily on a walking stick made necessary by the crippling pain of an arthritic hip. His manner was staid, unlike that of his vivacious wife, who often exercised her notoriously sharp wit in revenge for his many infidelities and arcane sexual pursuits. She sought refuge in alcohol and in sentimental friendships with other, younger women. Cochran's art collection included impressionist paintings acquired long before they became fashionable, many of them gradually sold off to finance new productions. The library that he amassed contained numerous valuable items and first editions. He himself, when temporarily out of funds, wrote in total four volumes of readable memoirs. One day, on taking his bath&#151;very hot water being the only thing that soothed his agonizing arthritis&#151;infirmity prevented him from reaching to switch off the hot tap and he was horribly scalded. He died, almost unrecognizable, a week later on 31 January 1951, in Westminster Hospital, and was cremated at Golders Green on 3 February.<br>
