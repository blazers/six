</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacDonald,  Flora</span>  (1722&#150;1790), <span class="occ">Jacobite heroine</span>, was born at Milton on the island of South Uist, Outer Hebrides, the third and last child of Ranald MacDonald (<i>d</i>. 1723), tacksman or leaseholder of Milton and Balivanich on South Uist, and his second wife, Marion (<i>d</i>. before 1771), daughter of the Revd Angus MacDonald and his wife, Flora. Flora is an Anglicization of the Gaelic name Fionnghal, and sometimes she signed herself Flory. The day and month of her birth are unknown, and her birthplace has been demolished, but a cairn marks its site just off the main north&#150;south road on the island. Flora was not a poor peasant girl as legend often presents her, but came of a good family, and was raised and continued to practise as a Presbyterian. Her father was a cousin of the chief of the MacDonalds of Clanranald, and was related to the powerful Argyll Campbells. Her mother could claim connection to the MacDonalds of Sleat, the lords of the Isles. Flora had two older brothers: Angus, who eventually inherited the Milton tack, and Ranald, who died in an accident as a young man.<br>
<br>Their father died in 1723, and Marion remarried in 1728. Her second husband, Hugh MacDonald of Sartle in Skye, who could claim connection to two chiefs, MacDonald of Sleat and MacLeod of Raasay, was a great swordsman and had led an adventurous life as a young man. He was known as Uisdean Cam, or One-Eyed Hugh, because he had lost an eye either in a childhood accident or while serving with the French army.<br>
<br>Flora grew into a cultured young woman, who sang well, played the spinet, and danced. There is no evidence, however, to support a claim of early biographers that she went to school in Edinburgh, or that the Clanranald or Sleat chiefs' wives helped with her education.<br>
<br>By 1745, when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5145/', "Prince Charles Edward")</script> arrived in Scotland, Flora's brother had taken over the tack of Milton, and Flora had moved to Armadale in Skye with her mother and her stepfather. Skye remained untouched by the 1745 campaign because the chief of Sleat refused to join the prince, but raised an independent militia regiment among his clansmen in support of the government. One-Eyed Hugh became one of its captains. After Charles Edward's defeat at Culloden in April 1746, his flight took him to the friendly Clanranald island of South Uist, where Flora happened to be visiting her brother. On learning of the prince's presence in the Outer Hebrides, government forces began a systematic search of the islands, which came close to capturing him. Unknown to Flora, a plan was devised to spirit Charles off the outer isles and back to Skye disguised as her Irish maid, Betty Burke, and the first she learned of the scheme was when the prince was brought to her secretly on the night of 20 June at a hut on a shieling or summer pasture on Sheaval Hill, where she had been sent to tend her brother's cattle. He was accompanied by one of Flora's kinsmen, Neil MacEachain, and by Captain Felix O'Neil, who each gave differing accounts of the meeting, but from Flora's account it would appear to have been the prince himself who asked her to help him. She agreed reluctantly.<br>
<br>Who planned the escape has never been explained, but her stepfather must be the chief suspect. He commanded the militia at the ford between South Uist and Benbecula at the time, and ordered the release of Flora and MacEachain when they were captured at the crossing. The journey was arranged with suspicious ease, and it was Hugh who supplied the pass to permit Flora to make the journey to Skye, accompanied by &#145;one Bettie Burke, an Irish girl, who, she tells me, is a good spinster&#146;  (Forbes, 2.32, 46). Lady Clanranald helped to make the Betty Burke dress, and the prince and Flora set sail from Benbecula to Skye on the night of 28&#150;9 June in a small boat crewed mainly by militiamen. Many tales were told afterwards about the escape, but Flora's favourite was the one in which she said she forbade Charles to carry his pistols under the petticoat of his dress, telling him that, if searched, they would give him away. &#145;If we shall happen to meet with any that will go so narrowly to work in searching as what you mean, they will certainly discover me at any rate&#146;, the prince replied  (ibid., 1.111).<br>
<br>Charles Edward landed at Trotternish in Skye, close to Monkstadt, home of MacDonald of Sleat, who was away at Fort Augustus at the time. Flora brought the prince to Sleat's house where the chief's wife, Lady Margaret MacDonald, gave him a meal and sent him south to the Sleat factor's house at Kingsburgh. Unfortunately the boatmen were sent back to Uist, where they were arrested and confessed. Flora and the factor were arrested, but the prince fled first to Raasay and then to the mainland, where he remained in hiding until he was picked up by two French ships on 19 September.<br>
<br>Flora was taken aboard the <i>Furnace</i> and questioned by Major-General John Campbell of Mamore, whom she faced with great courage and apparent openness, but her answers concealed as much as they revealed. Like many other prisoners she was sent to London, but Campbell ordered that she should be treated well during the voyage aboard the <i>Bridgewater</i>. Unsubstantiated tradition claims she was held in the Tower of London for a few days, but for most of her imprisonment she was at the house of a messenger-at-arms, along with other important prisoners, until her release some days after the general amnesty was declared in July 1747. She remained a further few days with the Jacobite sympathizer Lady Primrose, who raised a subscription of &pound;1500 for her, then left for Edinburgh, where she arrived on 2 August. Flora did not travel back to the Hebrides immediately, apparently unable to face returning to the islands, but spent the winter of 1746&#150;7 in Edinburgh, taking lessons to improve her handwriting. The Revd Robert Forbes, who at this time was collecting first-hand accounts of those involved in the rising of 1745 (subsequently published in 1895&#150;6 as <span class="italic">The Lyon in Mourning</span>), tried hard to persuade her to tell her story, but she did so reluctantly through an intermediary, John Burton. She returned to Skye in July 1747 but was back in London before the end of the year, apparently to arrange her finances.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1750 Flora married her kinsman Allan MacDonald (1722&#150;1792) of Kingsburgh, a good-looking, amiable young man with advanced farming ideas but with a poor business sense, and they farmed at Flodigarry until Allan succeeded his father as Sleat factor. They had seven children, Charles (1751&#150;1795), Anne (1754&#150;1834), Alexander (1755&#150;1781), Ranald (1756&#150;1782), James (1757&#150;1807), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17440/', "John MacDonald (1759&#150;1831)")</script>, and Frances (<i>b</i>. 1766). The Flodigarry years swallowed up Flora's fortune, and Allan quarrelled with his chief, leaving them in sore financial straits. It was during this period that Samuel Johnson and James Boswell visited Kingsburgh, and Boswell described Flora, now fifty-one, as &#145;a little woman of genteel appearance, and uncommonly mild and well-bred&#146;. Allan was &#145;completely the figure of a gallant Highlander&#146;. Flora was taken with Johnson, and confided more of her story to him than she ever did to others: she even joked with him and told him that while she was on the mainland she had heard that Mr Boswell was on his way to Skye, &#145;a young English buck with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's Journal</span>, 159). Johnson was accorded the honour of sleeping in the bed Prince Charlie had slept in the night he stayed at Kingsburgh in 1746.<br>
<br>In 1774 Allan and Flora emigrated to North Carolina, where members of their family were already living, and settled at Cheek's Creek in Anson (now Montgomery) County. However, before their seed was properly through the ground in the spring of 1775 the American War of Independence broke out, and neither Flora nor Allan doubted that their duty lay with George III. Flora encouraged highlanders to join the Royal Highland Emigrants 84th regiment, in which her husband, son, and son-in-law all served. The highland army was defeated by the patriots at Moore's Creek Bridge on 27 February 1776, and Allan was taken prisoner. Flora wrote that he &#145;and about 30 other gentlemen were draged [<i>sic</i>] from gaol to gaol for 700 miles, till lodged in Philadelphia gaol, remaining in their hands for 18 months before exchanged&#146;  (F. Macdonald to Sir John MacPherson, 21 Oct 1789, NL Scot.). Flora and her husband have been accused of involving themselves &#145;needlessly and recklessly&#146; in the war  (Maclean, 35), but Flora herself wrote,<blockquote>When the American Rebellion brock [<i>sic</i>] out, and [Continental] Congress, forcing her husband to joyne them, being a leading man among the highlanders, and seeing he would be obliged to joyne either party, he went in disguise to Fort Johnston on to mouth of the river Capefear, and there settled the plan of riseing the Highlanders in arms, with Governor Martin. (F. Macdonald to Sir John MacPherson, 21 Oct 1789, NL Scot.)</blockquote>She suffered great hardship, and was brought before a patriot committee of safety during Allan's imprisonment, but was eventually allowed to travel to New York in April 1778 to be reunited with him. After he rejoined his regiment in Nova Scotia, Flora travelled to Fort Edward, near Windsor, to be with him, but she still had not recovered from her Carolina ordeal, and felt ill, lonely, and homesick. At the end of 1779 she returned to Britain. Her second son, Alexander (Sandy), who had been a prisoner with his father, was lost at sea in 1781, and only a year later her third son, Ranald, was drowned when his ship, the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, foundered off Newfoundland. Her health broken, Flora settled in Skye, where Allan joined her in 1785; he would have settled in Nova Scotia, but received only &pound;440 plus &pound;276 for loss of income in compensation for his war service and North Carolina losses&#151;too little to begin a new life in Nova Scotia.<br>
<br>They ended their days at Penduin, near Kingsburgh, Skye, comfortably off, thanks to their son John, who made his fortune in the East. Almost the only clue Flora gave to her reason for agreeing to assist Prince Charlie's escape lies in the answer to George II's son, Prince Frederick, whom she met in London. When he asked why she had helped his father's enemies, she replied that she would have done the same for him had she found him in distress. Flora died at Penduin on 4 March 1790, and her husband, Allan, two years later, on 20 September 1792. Both were buried on Skye, at Kilmuir, 16 miles north of Kingsburgh.<br>
<br>The journey over the sea to Skye became a legend from the day it was made, and even as a prisoner in London in 1746 Flora was treated as a heroine. But oral tradition in the Hebrides largely ignored her, and even Lady Nairne failed to use such obvious material for a pro-Jacobite song. In 1870 the heroine's granddaughter, Flora Frances Wylde, produced a highly coloured <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> so full of obvious inaccuracies that it could not have been written by the heroine, and the Revd Alexander MacGregor's <span class="italic">Life</span>, written ten years later and said to have been based on information from Flora's daughter, Anne, had no more basis in truth. Flora's memory was better served by James Hogg, Robert Louis Stevenson, and many others, who were moved to write poems in her honour. However, it is Harold Boulton's &#145;Skye Boat Song&#146; that has best caught the spirit of her adventure, although it makes no more than a passing reference to Flora. By the time that song was written in the 1880s the world had come under the spell of the Flora MacDonald legend, which was carried round the world by emigrant Scots. Nowhere was it more enthusiastically accepted than in North Carolina and Nova Scotia. In North Carolina, the most Scottish of all the states of the USA, schools and colleges have been named after her, and her memory is greatly respected in spite of her support for the British at the revolution. A great upsurge of Scottish interest followed in that state during the second half of the twentieth century, and highland games began to be held annually at Grandfather Mountain in 1956. All through Flora's story legend has insinuated itself into truth, but the words of Samuel Johnson when he visited her in 1773 sum up both the woman and her legend: &#145;A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour&#146;  (Johnson, 67).<br>
