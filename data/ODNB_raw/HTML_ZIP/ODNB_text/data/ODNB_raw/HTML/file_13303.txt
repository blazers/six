<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Didymus Mountaine]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1528&#150;<em>c.</em>1574), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, described himself as a &#145;Londoner&#146;, and claimed to have been &#145;alwayes rudely taughte, amonge the Smythes of Vulcanus forge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proffitable Arte of Gardening</span>, 1568, sig. dd3<i>r</i>). However, Hill knew Latin and Italian and he became known as a translator of popular books on science and the supernatural. His first publication, in 1556, was a translation of a Latin compilation on physiognomy. This was dedicated to a physician, George Keble, as was its successor in 1559, a compilation on the interpretation of dreams, which ran to five editions. In 1560, the year of his first extant almanac, he was described as a leading almanac-maker, &#145;both lerned and honest&#146;  (Fulke, sig. B1<i>r</i>). Hill produced at least eight more almanacs, becoming one of the first English makers of such a series, and one of the first to produce an almanac (in 1571) with blank pages, for use as a pocket diary. About 1560 he also published <span class="italic">A Briefe Treatyse of Gardening</span>, the first book on that subject in English; this ran to nine editions.<br>
<br>In 1567 Hill produced three more books: another work on dreams; one on phenomena such as comets, marvellous bodies of water, fiery portents, rainbows, and earthquakes; and a collection of receipts for conjuring tricks, practical jokes, household matters, and divination, perhaps translated from Latin, and meant &#145;for the recreation of wittes at vacant tymes&#146;, which was reprinted as late as 1684. Hill enlarged his physiognomical translation in 1571 with a new dedication to the duke of Norfolk, an acknowledgement of help from John Dee, and liminary verses in Latin and Greek. In the same year he advertised exclusive manuscript copies of unpublished works, such as his <span class="italic">Guide of the Matrone</span>, which offered to expound &#145;practises purchased of manye iolly Dames, and Countesses of Italy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Contemplation of Mankinde</span>, 1571). These were attempts to raise Hill's status as an author, as may have been the elegant pseudonym Didymus Mountaine, under which a new, handsomely illustrated compilation, <span class="italic">The Gardners Labyrinth</span>, was published in 1577. Hill had died, however, before this was printed; the Latin poet Henry Dethick saw it through the press.<br>
<br>Hill's translations of works on chemical medicine by Conrad Gesner and Leonardo Fioravanti (<span class="italic">The Newe Iewell of Health</span>, 1576, and <span class="italic">A Ioyfull Iewell</span>, 1579) were completed by two friends of his, George Baker and John Hester. These books were instrumental in making Paracelsianism widely known in England. A mathematical and astronomical textbook, <span class="italic">The Schoole of Skil</span>, which rejects Copernicanism, was printed by William Jaggard in 1599; many of Hill's unpublished works must have been lost. Dethick, Hester, and Jaggard all commented on Hill's unornamented style and agreed that his work was nevertheless admirable. Jaggard wrote that &#145;It is not vnlike, but he would (if God had spared him longer life) haue held on as he began, to set forth for the common good of his and our Country diuers necessary works&#146;  (<span class="italic">Schoole of Skil</span>, sig. A4<i>r</i>).<br>
