<span class="headword">Bullock,  George</span>  (1784/5&#150;1818), <span class="occ">sculptor and cabinet-maker</span>, was the fourth son of James Bullock and his second wife, Sibylla, of Bristol, the owners of a travelling waxworks. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3923/', "William Bullock")</script>, became an artist, naturalist, explorer, and museum proprietor; a sister, Mary Ann, was also born in 1784/5. Little is known of Bullock's early life, although the family appears to have spent time on the English south coast, at Plymouth and Portsea before his birth. By March 1797 &#145;Mrs Bullock and Son&#146; were conducting modelling and drawing lessons at their &#145;Modelling and Statuary Warehouse&#146; at 29 Bull Street, Birmingham.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1799 Bullock advertised as a &#145;modeller in rice paste&#146; at 12 Ann Street, Birmingham. He remained in Birmingham until 1801. His brother William, who had started a &#145;cabinet of curiosities&#146; in Birmingham in 1800, moved to Liverpool in 1801 and opened a museum. George moved to Liverpool and produced his first documented work, a wax portrait relief of Henry Blundell of Ince, the connoisseur and sculpture collector. This is signed &#145;G. Bullock 1801&#146;. Bullock worked as a sculptor, showing six busts at the Royal Academy in London in 1804. In 1804&#150;5 he was in partnership with William Stoakes as general furnishers and marble workers and in 1809&#150;10 with the architect J. M. Gandy as &#145;architects, modellers, sculptors, marble masons, cabinet-makers and upholsterers&#146;  (Wainwright, <span class="italic">George Bullock</span>, 144). On 11 May 1805 Bullock married, at St Thomas's Church, Liverpool, Margaret Casson (<i>b</i>. 1783/4), who was from that city.<br>
<br>By 1806 Bullock had purchased &#145;some marble quarries containing two beds of rocks, the one resembling, in colour and effect, the Oriental porphyry, and the other the <i>verd antique</i>&#146;. This was on the Isle of Anglesey and Bullock, using the ancient Welsh name as a clever marketing ploy, began to sell his &#145;Mona marble&#146;. At this time of war continental marbles were hard to obtain and his chimney pieces and marble tops for furniture sold very well. Capitalizing on this patriotic British theme he soon manufactured furniture made of native woods and decorated with elaborate brass inlay based upon native plants, depicting hops, for instance, instead of grapes. He provided the furniture and marble fittings for a number of houses, including Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire, Storrs Hall in Westmorland, and Hafod in Wales.<br>
<br>In 1809 William Bullock moved to London and in 1812 George sold up and joined him at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly. In 1813 he formed a partnership with Charles Fraser, a colonel in the East India Company's service, as &#145;upholder, cabinet-maker and marble mason&#146;  (Levy, 146). This probably brought the injection of capital needed to establish extensive cabinet-making and marble-working workshops. They leased a grand house at 4 Tenterden Street, just off Hanover Square, the garden of which ran north and contained the workshops which fronted on to Oxford Street.<br>
<br>The furniture which Bullock manufactured (and unusually for a cabinet-maker also largely designed) was stylistically in advance of any then being made. His firm expanded, supplying Sir Walter Scott, Sir Geoffrey Webster, the dukes of Atholl and Buccleuch, and the marquess of Abercorn. His most famous commission was to supply all the furniture and furnishings for the house constructed for Napoleon on St Helena.<br>
<br>Strikingly handsome with an artistic and very engaging personality, Bullock entertained fashionable London at Tenterden Street. He died at home in Tenterden Street on 1 May 1818, and was buried at St George's, Hanover Square.<br>
