<span class="headword">Love,  Richard</span>  (1596&#150;1661), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 26 December 1596 in Great St Mary's parish, Cambridge, the second of three children and the only son of Richard Love (<i>d</i>. 1605), an apothecary, and Margaret, daughter of William Bosome. Margaret remarried in 1607, her new husband being Henry Mowtlowe (<i>d</i>. 1634), Gresham professor of law and public orator, one of the friends the apothecary entrusted with his son's education in the advent of Margaret's death. Love matriculated from King's College, Cambridge, in 1611, gaining his BA in 1615 from Clare College and proceeding MA in 1618. He was ordained deacon and priest in 1624, was a university taxor in 1625&#150;6, and became a fellow before 1628, the year in which he was senior proctor. He was in La Rochelle when that stronghold of Calvinism was besieged in the summer of 1628, and about the same time was made chaplain in ordinary to Charles I, who on 27 October 1629 presented him to the living of Eckington, Derbyshire. In January 1631 he proceeded DD on the king's recommendation. The following October he received the prebend of Tachbrook in Lichfield Cathedral.<br>
<br>By mandate from Charles I, Love was made master of Corpus Christi College on 4 April 1632, immediately after Dr Butts's suicide. A quarrel followed between Love and the earl of Warwick that demonstrates Love's tactfulness and powers of persuasion. Warwick, supported by Charles, tried to press his nominee for a vacant fellowship, but the master and fellows resisted. The king eventually withdrew his candidate, after receiving a letter of apology and explanation from Love. His most notable act as vice-chancellor in 1633/4 was to cause the arrest of Peter Hausted in the pulpit of St Mary's while preaching a sermon against the neglect of religious duties in the university. Love also contributed on occasions when the university presented congratulatory verses.<br>
<br>Love married, about 1632, Grace, his stepfather's daughter, and settled in St Benedict's parish, Cambridge. Their daughter Anne (<i>b</i>. 1633) later married Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury, who bequeathed Love's portrait to Corpus Christi College. Grace (<i>b</i>. 1635) married John Lawson, an eminent physician. Sons Richard (<i>b</i>. 1637) and Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1638) followed; Henry (<i>b</i>. 1640) died soon after birth; John arrived in 1648.<br>
<br>Despite the difficulties of the times Love retained his headship during the civil war. He preached a sermon at Whitehall to parliament at the monthly fast on 30 March 1642, &#145;The watchman's watchword&#146;, in which he criticized the threats both from Laudianism and from radical protestants' attacks on church hierarchy, and appealed for the promotion of preaching. It was subsequently published by royal command at Cambridge with the aim of attracting religious moderates to Charles's side. This did not make Love's position in parliamentarian-controlled Cambridge untenable. He probably took the solemn league and covenant as, when in July 1643 a general leave of absence was granted to the fellows, he was one of the four heads of college at Cambridge who, &#145;by the special favour of the friends and their own wary compliance, continued in their places&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">History of Cambridge</span>, 169). When in December 1643 William Dowsing cleansed the colleges' chapels he found Love's conservatism had prevented the installation of Laudian furnishings at Corpus Christi. Love survived the rash of ejections prompted by the earl of Manchester's visitation of the university, and was included in February 1646 with those heads directed by parliament to preach at St Mary's. In 1647 he was appointed to a syndicate to maintain the university muniments.<br>
<br>Love also remained in place throughout the interregnum. Oliver Cromwell addressed him as &#145;my worthy friend&#146; in 1649. In the same year he was made Lady Margaret professor of divinity, and despite staunchly defending Anglican doctrines and disciplines appears to have retained his prebend. Love's friend Colonel Valentine Walton, the regicide, was said, at an unspecified time, to have protected him. When faced with the engagement in 1650, Love joined other heads of colleges in petitioning, requesting that a promise not to disturb the present government might be accepted as their subscription. Grace informed a relative that they anticipated ruin if he was compelled to resign the professorship and claimed the stress of the situation prompted the return of &#145;His Olde Disease of the Spleen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Masters' History</span>, appx, 73). By November he was suspended, but rumours that a way would be found for him to appear to have satisfied the engagement proved correct, and he retained his preferments. Love's retrospective explanation was that, having demonstrated his disapproval of the trial and execution of Charles I, inviting an expulsion would be abandoning what power he retained to do good. His sermons about this time questioned the Calvinist emphasis on faith rather than works. He was appointed a member of the assembly of divines, but took no part in the proceedings. Although he survived the purge of college masters, he was omitted from the 1654 commission to regulate the university. In 1656, however, he and Anthony Tuckney were praised in the <span class="italic">Publick Intelligencer</span> for the international eminence they brought to the university and the nation. Love undertook a limited smartening up of the college chapel in 1659&#150;60. J. B. Mullinger states he was the only head to retain his position until the Restoration.<br>
<br>Love composed two Latin congratulatory pieces. The first, delivered at Cambridge, discusses the calamities of the rebellion and excuses his temporary acquiescence. The second (published by the king's command) was presented by Love in person, acting as deputy vice-chancellor at Whitehall on 5 June 1660. He also contributed to the Cambridge collection of verses which were published at the Restoration. He made such a good impression that Charles II, besides allowing him to retain his posts, made him dean of Ely by patent dated 14 August; he was installed on 28 September.<br>
<br>Love died at the beginning of February 1661, and was buried in his college chapel. In his will, which was proved on 26 May 1661, his wife was the executor and main beneficiary and was entrusted with the education of their son John. Love's Latin books were bequeathed to John if he fulfilled his father's hopes that he would join the ministry. His daughters were provided with dowries, but his sons Richard and Thomas were intentionally omitted from his will. Among the larger bequests he laid out &pound;100 on the college, gave a window to the master's lodge, and left &pound;10 and a polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>. To his old college, Clare, whose master, Dr Paske, was his friend, he left &pound;50. Love's moderation and remarkable levels of tact and discretion, which allowed him to retain the good opinion of so many enemies in such turbulent times, no less than his eminent reputation, suggest he was an extraordinary man.<br>
