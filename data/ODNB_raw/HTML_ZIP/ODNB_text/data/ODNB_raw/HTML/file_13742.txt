<span class="headword">Hopkin,  Lewis</span>  (1707/8&#150;1771), <span class="occ">poet and artisan</span>, was the youngest son of Lewis Hopkin (<i>c</i>.1675&#150;1756) of Peterston-super-montem, Glamorgan, and Joan (1674/5&#150;1753), daughter of William Thomas of neighbouring Penrhiw-fer. One of his ancestors was the gentleman&#150;poet Hopcyn Tomas Phylip (<i>d</i>. 1597) of Gelli'r-fid, Llandyfodwg, Glamorgan, an author of free-metre religious carols called <i>cwndidau</i>. When he was still a young man Hopkin moved to the parish of Llandyfodwg, the birthplace of many of his ancestors, and it was there, at Hendre Ifan Goch, that he lived until his death. Trained as a carpenter, he became skilled in other crafts as well, including those of glazier, stonemason, and wire-worker. In the latter part of his life he took to farming, and he also owned a fairly large country shop. According to his son, many sought his services in surveying, planning, measuring, calculating, and writing law documents. He built a house and furnished it himself.<br>
<br>Lewis Hopkin became a nonconformist and was a member (and possibly a deacon) of the Independent Congregational assembly at Cymer, Porth. He married Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1775), daughter of Thomas Bevan, a member of a family of staunch Quakers. His eldest son, Lewis (1734&#150;1789), who became minister of the Independent church at Bromyard, Herefordshire, maintained that he was so zealously religious in his latter years that he held meetings on sabbath day evenings from house to house to expound the scriptures, and that he had a pulpit from which he preached whenever he held services in his barn at Hendre Ifan Goch. He was a figure of considerable importance in the nonconformist circles of Upper Glamorgan.<br>
<br>Hopkin was also a prominent and influential figure in the literary revival that occurred in Glamorgan in the early eighteenth century. As a boy he had received instruction in English, writing, and mathematics, and later, by dint of his own efforts, he acquired a reasonably good knowledge of Latin, to which he also added a wide acquaintance with English literature. He also mastered the Welsh bardic craft and played a prominent role in organizing local eisteddfodau. Some of his poems appeared in various eighteenth-century almanacs and in the journal called <span class="italic">Trysorfa Gwybodaeth</span> (1770), and an elegiac <i>cywydd</i> by him was published in Carmarthen in 1769. In 1813 his son-in-law, John Miles, published a collection of his poetry under the title <span class="italic">Y fel gafod</span>. His verse reflects the resolute efforts he had made to master the intricate rules relating to <i>cynghanedd</i> and the twenty-four strict metres. He also composed some verses in English and made splendid Welsh translations of &#145;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&#146; and of James Thomson's &#145;The History of Lavinia&#146;. The letters he addressed to his son Lewis reflect a devout and cultured mind and clearly testify to his firm command of English. Among the works he had in his possession were English and Welsh books of a literary and devotional nature, volumes on law and medicine, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and some Latin and French books. Both Edward Evan (1716&#150;1798) and Edward Williams 
    (Iolo Morganwg; 1747&#150;1826)
   were instructed by him in the bardic craft.<br>
<br>Hopkin died on 17 November 1771, aged sixty-three, and was buried with his children and ancestors in Llandyfodwg churchyard. Among the elegies addressed to him are those composed by Edward Evan in <span class="italic">Afalau'r awen</span>, and by Iolo Morganwg under the title <span class="italic">Dagrau yr awen</span> (1772).<br>
<br>Only four of Lewis Hopkin's eleven children lived to maturity. Two of those who died very young were dwarfs, who grew no taller than 32 inches. The girl, named Joan, died of smallpox when she was thirteen. The boy, <a name="cosubject_13742"></a><span class="headword">Hopkin Hopkin</span>  (1737&#150;1754)<span class="occ"></span>, known as Hopcyn Bach (Little Hopkin), was exhibited to various groups in London, including some members of the royal family. His weight never exceeded 17 lb, and he died in Glamorgan, &#145;seemingly of old age&#146; on 19 March 1754, when he was in his eighteenth year  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). His suit, &#145;court coat&#146;, and gauntlet are now kept in the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff.<br>
