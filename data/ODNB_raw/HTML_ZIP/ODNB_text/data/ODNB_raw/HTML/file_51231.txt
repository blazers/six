<span class="headword">Meaney, Sir  Patrick Michael</span>  (1925&#150;1992), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 6 May 1925 at 66 Bodmin Street, Wandsworth, London, the youngest in the family of two sons and two daughters of Joseph Francis Meaney, a tram driver, and his wife, Ethel Clara Martin. He was at first named Patrick Henry. Brought up in London, he was educated at Wimbledon College and the Northern Polytechnic. He served in the armed forces during the Second World War, remaining from 1941 until 1947; he was with the 6th airborne division at Arnhem. Meaney was married twice. His first marriage having ended in divorce, his second marriage, on 9 July 1968, was to Mary June Connell (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), the daughter of Albert William Kearney, a company director. He had a son, Adam, and a stepson and stepdaughter from his second marriage.<br>
<br>In 1951 Meaney joined the haulage group Thomas Tilling Ltd. He rose in the company to become a director in 1961 and managing director and chief executive in 1973; under his management the group developed a strong building-product division and took over a number of companies in order to expand and diversify its activities. Following the recession of 1980&#150;81, and the slump in profits, Meaney was unable to prevent the hostile takeover of Thomas Tilling by BTR in 1983: as a result of this, he was ousted from his job.<br>
<br>Meaney had been a director of the Rank Organization since 1979, and at the end of 1983 he replaced Sir John Davis as chairman. The Rank Organization, founded in 1933 by the Methodist J. Arthur Rank as the Religious Film Society to make films for Sunday schools and Methodist halls, had developed into a large film-making company; it diversified in the 1950s, when Rank took over the family flour business in 1952 and set up Rank Xerox Ltd in 1956 to manufacture photocopying equipment. By the late 1960s, when the Rank Organization stopped making films, Rank Xerox was contributing over 90 per cent of the group's overall profit, and Meaney saw his main task as developing the group's other activities in order to lessen its dependence on Rank Xerox. He appointed Michael Gifford, from Cadbury Schweppes, as his chief executive, and together they built up the cinema chain and film-distribution side of the group and modernized the Top Rank bingo clubs. By 1992 the Rank Organization had a stock market value of &pound;1.8 billion and a workforce of 45,000.<br>
<br>Meaney was also on the boards of several other companies, including Cable and Wireless from 1978 to 1984, ICI from 1981, and Tarmac from 1989, and he was chairman of the Mecca Leisure Group from 1990. Keenly interested in horse-racing, from 1985 he was a director of Racecourse Technical Services Ltd and Metropolitan and Country Racecourse Management Holdings Ltd and deputy chairman of the Horserace Betting Levy Board. A director of Midland Bank from 1980, he was appointed deputy chairman in 1984 and served as chairman of the remuneration committee. He played a crucial part in the merger negotiations with the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HBSC) at the beginning of 1992, when his negotiating skills ensured that a likely takeover bid from Lloyds Bank was deflected.<br>
<br>Meaney was much in demand for membership of trade and industry committees, and served on the councils of the Confederation of British Industry and the London chamber of commerce and industry, and on the stock exchange listed companies advisory committee. He was president of the Chartered Institute of Marketing from 1981 to 1991: during his presidency the membership grew to 50,000, and the institute developed a relationship with the Department of Trade and Industry that led to the successful marketing initiative, while he helped to make contact with influential people interested in business development and built up a panel of vice-presidents from the leaders of British industry. He was asked by the government to chair the review committee on the shipbuilding company Harland and Woolf in 1980. He also chaired the commerce and industry committee of the Great Ormond Street Hospital's wishing well appeal.<br>
<br>A jovial and friendly man, Meaney was widely respected in the City for his energy and his ability to grasp the essentials of every situation and problem. A keen rugby player, he belonged to Harlequins Rugby Club. He was also a great opera lover and a Francophile. He was knighted in 1981. He died of heart failure at 27 Circus Road, Westminster, on 16 July 1992, survived by his wife, Mary, his son, Adam, and his stepson and stepdaughter. There was a memorial service on 7 October 1992 at the church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London.<br>
