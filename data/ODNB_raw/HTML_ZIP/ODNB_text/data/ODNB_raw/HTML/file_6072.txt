<span class="headword">Coningsburgh,  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1479<span class="mult">x</span>81), <span class="occ">archbishop of Armagh</span>, was apparently English in origin, though nothing certain is known of his background. He attended the University of Cambridge, where he had taken the degree of bachelor of canon law by 1448. He also attended an unidentified foreign university and became doctor of canon law by 1469. He became rector of St Leonard, Foster Lane, London (12 January 1448), vicar of South Weald, Essex (13 October 1450), and rector of Copford, also in Essex (3 November 1451), receiving a papal dispensation to hold an additional incompatible benefice on 26 July 1452.<br>
<br>In 1455, and frequently afterwards, Coningsburgh was employed in university business at Cambridge. He was one of the syndics for building the philosophical and law schools in 1457. It appears that he was a proctor in the court of the bishop of Ely. He may have been originally a member of Corpus Christi College; certainly he occupied chambers there from 1468 to 1473. In 1469 he and Walter Buck, master of arts, had a joint commission from Bishop William Grey of Ely to visit Rome as that prelate's proxies. During that year he is recorded as warden of the English hospice of St Thomas in Rome. He became rector of St James, Colchester, on 1 January 1470. On 10 August 1471 Edward IV addressed a letter of congratulation on his election to Pope Sixtus IV, and sent his councillor, James Goldwell, bishop of Norwich, and Coningsburgh to Rome as envoys. In 1471&#150;2 Coningsburgh was vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1475 Coningsburgh was appointed archbishop of Armagh by papal provision and was consecrated in Rome by English bishops in early 1477. However, his predecessors had left the archdiocese of Armagh in debt to Italian bankers for 1100 florins, and the pope was concerned that this debt should be cleared. As a result, Coningsburgh was forced to leave his bulls of provision in the hands of the bankers as surety for his promise to repay the loan in two instalments over three years. The pope also, on 13 June 1477, appointed Octavian del Palaccio, a Florentine priest and doctor of canon law, as papal nuncio and governor of the archdiocese in matters both spiritual and temporal, until Coningsburgh had paid off the debt.<br>
<br>However, Coningsburgh and Alfred Cornburgh, an esquire of the body to Edward IV, were given a commission from the king on 21 June 1477 to hear and determine all controversies, suits, and debates depending between any of the great men or peers of Ireland; and on 3 July Coningsburgh had the temporalities of the see, then in the king's hands, restored to him, along with permission to recover any other property of the archdiocese which might have been lost. Edward was at this time attempting to re-establish control over Ireland after his estrangement from his brother the duke of Clarence, lieutenant of Ireland since 1472. Royal influence outside the pale was virtually non-existent and Coningsburgh's arrival at Dundalk in August 1477, armed with these powers, seems to have been a major plank in Edward's strategy.<br>
<br>However, when Coningsburgh met with the dean and chapter of Armagh there on 5 September 1477, they demanded to see his bulls of provision. Since he was unable to produce them, they refused to grant him permission to exercise his office, citing canon law, and instead he took up residence in Drogheda. By late September Octavian had arrived and presented his papal rescript, which was accepted by the dean and chapter.<br>
<br>On 10 November Octavian and Coningsburgh met, and Coningsburgh, unable to maintain his position, resigned as archbishop, appointing the nuncio as proctor and commissary in return for an annual pension of 50 marks. He returned to England, where he became a suffragan of the bishop of Ely, but he and the king were not content, and on 2 May 1478 Edward renewed the grant of temporalities to Coningsburgh. Nothing resulted from this, however, and Octavian was consecrated as archbishop of Armagh at some point between 30 September 1479 and 31 January 1480. Nothing more is known of Coningsburgh, save for the payment of &pound;1 to the University of Cambridge in respect of a debt of &pound;2, in 1481 by his executors. Claims that he was a suffragan of the bishop of Norwich in 1502 are unsupported, and the likelihood is that he died between 1479 and 1481.<br>
<br>Coningsburgh was the last of a succession of Englishmen appointed to the see of Armagh by the king, the previous two of whom had been responsible for the debt that dominated his short tenure there. Owing to this situation, Coningsburgh was unable to make any impact on the problems of the province of Armagh, and it remained for Octavian to pay off the debts and improve the condition of the diocese over the next few years. Perhaps the most significant aspect of this short interlude is that it was the pope's concerns and wishes that prevailed over those of Edward IV.<br>
