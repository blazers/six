<span class="headword">Dorset <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Turner]</span>,  Catherine Ann</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> in or after 1816), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was the younger daughter of Nicholas Turner of Stoke, near Guildford, Surrey, and Bignor Park, Sussex, and his wife, Anna (<i>c</i>.1727&#150;<i>c</i>.1752), daughter of William Towers. Catherine was baptized at Stoke on 15 January 1753; her mother probably died in childbirth with Catherine, and her care consequently fell to an aunt. In 1764 her father remarried; his new wife was a Miss Meriton. Little is known of Catherine's childhood with her sister, Charlotte [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25790/', "Smith, Charlotte (1749&#150;1806)")</script>]. On 2 June 1779, in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Catherine married Michael Dorset (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1805), a captain in the army and probably the son of Michael Dorset MA, incumbent successively of Rustington and Walberton, in Sussex. They had two children, Lucy Smith Dorset (<i>bap</i>. 1780) and Charles Ferguson Dorset (<i>bap</i>. 1782).<br>
<br>In 1804 some poems by Catherine Ann Dorset appeared anonymously in her sister's <span class="italic">Conversations Introducing Poetry</span>, a temporarily popular compilation for children. Charlotte Smith, better known for her adult fiction, produced various works for children in the 1790s and early 1800s and this may have encouraged her sister to write. About 1805 Catherine Ann Dorset was widowed and in 1806 she sold the interest in Bignor Park bequeathed to her by her father. In 1807 her poem for children <span class="italic">The Peacock &#145;at Home&#146;</span> was published as &#145;by a lady&#146; for the second number of John Harris's <span class="roman">Cabinet</span> series, illustrated by William Mulready. The initial two publications in the series were to cause something of a stir; the first had been <span class="italic">The Butterfly's Ball</span> by William Roscoe, and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> printed some correspondence debating the relative merits of these two numbers. Some readers asserted the superiority of Dorset's &#145;exquisite little Poem&#146;, and suggested that it might be a &#145;satire upon the manners of the times&#146;, while others attributed the poem's success merely to the gender of its author and complained also that its ornithological detail would deter young readers. Nevertheless, <span class="italic">The Peacock &#145;at Home&#146;</span> was a great success, selling 40,000 copies within a year, and reaching a twenty-eighth edition by 1819. On the back of this success, Harris published eleven further numbers in this series of tiny (5 inch &times; 4 inch) volumes for children. These included another work by Catherine Ann Dorset, <span class="italic">Think before you Speak, or, The Three Wishes</span> (1809), a translation of a French folk story as related by Mme de Beaumont. It is also possible that another title in the series, <span class="italic">The Lion's Masquerade</span> (1807), was one of Catherine Ann Dorset's publications. Revised and unillustrated versions of <span class="italic">The Peacock &#145;at Home&#146; and other Poems</span> appeared in 1809 under Dorset's married name. <span class="italic">The Peacock</span> was reprinted in 1849, illuminated by her grandniece W. Warde, and a careful facsimile of the original edition appeared in 1883.<br>
<br>Catherine Ann Dorset also wrote an important memoir of Charlotte Smith, published in Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Prose Works</span> (6 vols., 1827), with Scott's critical remarks appended. Little information on Catherine Ann Dorset herself emerges from the memoir, save her disapproval of the French Revolution. Catherine Ann Dorset was still alive in 1816, but nothing is known of her after this time. Her son went on to become an officer in the army and he also wrote some poetry and military works.<br>
