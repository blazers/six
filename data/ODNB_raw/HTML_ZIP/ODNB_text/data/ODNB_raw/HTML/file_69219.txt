<span class="headword">Campbell <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Anderson, Telfer]</span>,  Agnes</span>  (1637&#150;1716), <span class="occ">printer and book merchant</span>, was born in Edinburgh in August 1637 and baptized there on 1 September 1637, the third daughter of James Campbell, a merchant of Edinburgh, formerly from Cumnock in Ayrshire, and Issobell, daughter of John Orr, merchant of Edinburgh. Agnes Campbell's sisters Beatrix and Jean were married respectively to the Edinburgh bookseller Archibald Hislop and to the Edinburgh goldsmith William Law, whose son John was the financial innovator responsible for the French economic crisis known as the Mississippi Bubble. In 1676 on the death of her husband, Andrew Anderson, Agnes succeeded as king's printer and printer to the burgh and university of Edinburgh; she generally used the imprint &#145;Heirs of Andrew Anderson&#146;. Latterly she adopted the name Lady Roseburn after acquiring the lands of Roseburn, Dalry, to the north-west of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69219"></a><span class="headword">Andrew Anderson</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1676) was a son of the printer George Anderson and Isobel Aitcheson. George, famous as printer to the revolutionary Glasgow general assembly of 1638, was burgh and college printer for Edinburgh (1637&#150;8), and first printer to the burgh of Glasgow (1638&#150;47). He had died by November 1647, but his widow continued the business, first in Glasgow (1648), and then in Edinburgh (1649&#150;53), at which point Andrew Anderson began running the press, which now took his name for its imprint. On 26 June 1656 he married Agnes. After returning to Glasgow (where he lived 1657&#150;61), Anderson finally settled his family and press in Edinburgh in May 1661, and he was in 1663 appointed <span class="occ">burgh and university printer</span> on the death of Gideon Lithgow (<i>fl</i>. 1645&#150;1662), at which time he became a burgess of the burgh by right of his wife, Agnes. He took advantage of the withdrawal from Edinburgh by the London Society of Stationers to purchase his appointment as king's printer in 1671, and the forty-one year patent was ratified by parliament in September 1672. Andrew and his partners were given unprecedented and controversial supervisory powers over the Scottish press; this began a period of trade dispute and litigation. However, in spite of his monopoly privileges, Anderson was heavily in debt at his death in Edinburgh on 1 June 1676.<br>
<br>Thereafter, in spite of a shaky start, Agnes Campbell developed her press until it was the largest in Scotland in the early modern period. Even in 1678 she had no fewer than sixteen apprentices. As royal printer she was exempt from import and export customs and excise dues. She traded widely in books and paper, taking advantage of these exemptions, and she acted as moneylender to numerous book traders in England, Ireland, and throughout Scotland. Competitors in Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Edinburgh protested repeatedly against her extensive monopoly rights, and in 1681 persuaded the privy council to reduce her privileges to those of her husband's predecessors. None the less, she was a dogged and generally successful litigant throughout her career and she was able to restrict the liberties of competitors and especially her major rival in Edinburgh, James Watson the younger (<i>fl</i>. 1695&#150;1722). Unfortunately for Campbell, she lost the most complex book-patent dispute of the time, which began in 1711. With her patent due to expire in 1712 she was unable to defeat Watson in the court of session when a new gift granted to Watson, the Jacobite printer Robert Freebairn (<i>fl</i>. 1701&#150;1747), and the English royal printer John Basket clashed with an alternative patent to Campbell, Freebairn, and Basket. George I did his best to confuse matters, but finally in 1718 the House of Lords confirmed Watson's rights and by 1726 the Anderson press had closed and the family were in financial difficulties.<br>
<br>Agnes Campbell's political and religious inclinations were establishment orientated. Hers was, nevertheless, the largest Presbyterian press in Edinburgh for her city competitors, Watson and Freebairn, were inclined to Episcopalian and Jacobite sympathies. In <span class="italic">A brief reply to the letter from Edinburgh relating to the case of Mrs. Anderson, her majesty's printer in Scotland</span> (1712) she smeared Watson as a &#145;papist&#146; and Freebairn as an educated drunk, but her motives were entirely personal and commercial, not idealistic. In fact, she was briefly censured by the revolution government in 1690 for being slow to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, her priority being, for the benefit of her press, to ensure she backed the winning side. Thereafter her long campaign to become printer to the general assembly, which lasted over two decades, ensured she took every opportunity to support Presbyterianism, though in a moderate manner acceptable in a government appointee. At last in 1712 she was appointed printer to the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Historians' assessments of Agnes Campbell's personality have been too dependent on the bitter reflections of James Watson. The &#145;wicked widow&#146; caricature emanates from Watson's disgust that a printer of such poor quality possessed the royal patent and also from his view that her extensive monopoly, and ruthless exploitation of it, gave &#145;the Art of printing a dead Stroke&#146; and &#145;damp'd all ingenious Attempts of advancing it&#146;  (Watson, 11&#150;12). Certainly Campbell protected her rights, restricted competitors, used the courts, printed propaganda, and produced counterfeit editions to undermine other licence holders, although her behaviour was typical not unique. One unbiased contemporary, Sir John Lauder of Fountainhall, simply stated that Mrs Anderson printed &#145;poor books&#146; and that her patent involved &#145;exorbitant clauses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Notices</span>, 2.866; 1.393). Yet Campbell is remarkable for her business success, if not for the quality of her printing. She was not merely a successful woman in the masculine world of commerce, but she became uniquely wealthy for a commercial woman in Scotland who had not inherited substantial means. The value of her inheritance lay in the potential of her position and monopolies, and her subsequent rise was testament to her business acumen.<br>
<br>Campbell's marriage to Andrew Anderson brought them at least eight children. Unfortunately, James, the only son to survive into adulthood, died in 1693, just when he was beginning to engage in the family business. On 22 March 1681 she married Patrick Telfer, Edinburgh merchant and widower. There were no children&#151;in fact the couple were estranged by the 1690s and she rarely used her second married name. When Agnes died, her book and paper businesses, including a large papermill established in 1706 at Valleyfield on the Esk waters of Penicuik, fell to her daughters and her sons-in-law. She acquired various properties in and around Edinburgh, some of which were tenements rented to members of the city's legal profession. The lands of Roseburn were acquired in 1704 and her further properties at Coats in Edinburgh and Cowdenknowes, Berwickshire, were acquired in 1710 and 1711 respectively. Her will and testament survive and at her death her estate was valued at &pound;78,000 Scots, a very large sum in Scottish terms. Agnes died in Edinburgh on 24 July 1716, and was buried at Greyfriars churchyard there three days later.<br>
