<span class="headword">Ogilvie,  Charles Atmore</span>  (1793&#150;1873), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, son of John Ogilvie of Whitehaven, Cumberland (<i>d</i>. 25 April 1839 at Duloe, Cornwall), and his wife, Catharine Curwen of the Isle of Man, was born at Whitehaven on 20 November 1793. He matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 27 November 1811; after taking a first class in 1815, he won the chancellor's prize for the English essay in 1817. He graduated BA in 1815, MA in 1818, and BD and DD in 1842. In 1816 he was elected a fellow of his college, and was ordained. He was tutor from 1819 to 1830, bursar in 1822, and senior dean in 1842. He was appointed a university examiner in 1823 and 1824, and examiner in the classical school in 1825. He greatly assisted Richard Jenkyns, the master of Balliol, in improving the tone and discipline of the college. Ogilvie is reputed to have been the major influence in the introduction of the open scholarship system on which Balliol's later academic reputation rested  (Jones, 187). Ogilvie saw himself as &#145;an attached and zealous member of the Church of England&#146;  (ibid., 181). Though at the end of the 1820s he was looked on as a leader of the high-church party in Oxford, he gave little active support to the Oxford Movement. He was a select preacher before the university in 1825, 1832, and 1844, and was Bampton lecturer in 1836, the lectures being published as <span class="italic">The Divine Glory Manifested</span> (1836).<br>
<br>Ogilvie held some clerical preferments while still fellow and tutor of Balliol. He was rector of Wickford, Essex, from 4 January 1822 to 1833; rector of Abbotsley, Huntingdonshire, from 30 August 1822 to 1839; and vicar of Duloe from 20 October 1833 to 1840. The rectory and vicarage of Ross, Herefordshire, conferred on him on 6 December 1839, he held until his death (together, from 1849, with his Oxford canonry). For a time he acted as domestic and examining chaplain to Archbishop William Howley. He resigned his fellowship in 1834, having ceased to teach in 1830. On 18 April 1838 he married Mary Ann Gurnell (<i>d</i>. 2 Oct 1875), daughter of Major Armstrong; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>On the foundation of a chair of pastoral theology in the university, Ogilvie became the first regius professor on 23 April 1842, and as professor he succeeded in 1849 to a canonry at Christ Church. His selection reflected the concern of Peel's government that the post should not go to a whig or to one of the many then embroiled in clerical dispute. He actively supported tory candidates in elections for the university burgess-ship. Through life Ogilvie maintained a close friendship with M. J. Routh, president of Magdalen College, with whom he corresponded on literary subjects from 1847 to 1854. He was also friendly with Joseph Blanco White and was a quite regular correspondent of Hannah More. Ogilvie published little beyond his Bampton lectures: a sermon (1836), two pamphlets on subscription (1845 and 1863), and an essay, <span class="roman">On the union of classical and mathematical studies</span>, (<span class="italic">Oxford English prize essays</span>, vol. 3, 1836). While lecturing on 15 February 1873 he was seized with paralysis, and he died in his house at Christ Church, Oxford, two days later. He was buried in the Latin chapel in Christ Church Cathedral.<br>
