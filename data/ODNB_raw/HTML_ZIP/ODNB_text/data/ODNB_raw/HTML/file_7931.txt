<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, tenth earl of Angus  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1611), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7929/', "William Douglas, ninth earl of Angus (d. 1591)")</script>, and his wife, Egidia or Giles Graham (<i>d</i>. in or after 1606), daughter of Robert Graham of Morphie. He studied at St Andrews University and then served his great-uncle James Douglas, earl of Morton, before going to France in 1577. While there he was converted to Roman Catholicism, to the annoyance of his protestant family. In 1585 (contract dated 12 April) he married Elizabeth Oliphant, eldest daughter of Laurence, Lord Oliphant, a supporter of Queen Mary in the Scottish civil war and a Catholic sympathizer. Douglas was ordered to leave the country on account of his religion in September 1589. He took legal instruments the following month affirming that he had gone to Aberdeen in obedience to this instruction, but found the sailing season over and was therefore obliged to remain at home. In May 1591 he was again ordered into exile, but the death of his father on 1 July that year prevented him from complying.<br>
<br>Having succeeded to the earldom, Angus took a notable part in public life, opposing James VI's wish to promote his favourite the duke of Lennox to prominence in the parliament of 1592. In the same year he was employed as king's lieutenant in the north, where he was successful in healing the feud between the earls of Atholl and Huntly which had arisen following the latter's murder of the earl of Moray. At the end of that year he was accused of involvement in the &#145;Spanish blanks&#146; affair, a putative conspiracy among Huntly and his Catholic associates, who were alleged to be encouraging Spanish intervention in Scotland in furtherance of the Catholic cause. On 3 January 1593 Angus was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, but on 13 February he escaped with the help of his wife. She was said to have smuggled a rope into his cell with which he got out. It was also claimed that the authorities were aware of the possibility of his escape and that one of his warders connived at it. He made his way north and entered into a bond of mutual defence with the earls of Huntly and Erroll.<br>
<br>Later in February 1593 King James and an army marched to Aberdeen against the Catholic earls, who proved reluctant to oppose the king personally and fled to Caithness. A parliament met in July, but James ensured that proceedings against the earls were impeded and that they were not forfeited. He was perhaps concerned at the threat from ultra-protestant elements in the kirk and wished, by protecting the earls, to ensure the survival of a Catholic counter-weight to strict Calvinist influence. An act of oblivion was offered to the earls should they submit to the reformed kirk; if they refused to accept this, they were to go into exile, but be allowed to retain their estates. The earls rejected the accommodation and in June 1594 were tried at the parliament in Edinburgh. Angus's possessions were forfeited and given to the duke of Lennox, while all three earls were excommunicated by the general assembly of the church.<br>
<br>During this time the earls remained at large in the north-east, where they mounted a punitive raid on the burgh of Aberdeen to release some unnamed foreign emissaries who had been imprisoned in the town on their way to meet Huntly. In the autumn the king sent the young earl of Argyll, a rival of Huntly, north to settle matters. He was defeated at Glenlivet on 3 October 1594. James then came in person, the earls once more declined to meet him in the field, and Huntly's castle and lands were ravaged. Although Angus was not present at Glenlivet, he had associated with the earl of Bothwell in stirring up unsuccessful diversionary activities in the south of Scotland. Erroll and Huntly now agreed to go abroad, but Angus remained in hiding in the north. In 1595 he reached a partial settlement with the king, in negotiations which were still in progress when Huntly and Erroll returned from exile in June 1596. In March 1597 the countess of Angus petitioned the general assembly, then sitting at Perth, to depute some ministers to confer with her husband on religious matters, and in June the three earls were publicly reconciled with the kirk.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards, on 29 June 1598, Angus was appointed lieutenant of the borders, where he discharged his duties so effectively, financing his administration from his own resources, that his post was renewed after a year. Doubts persisted about the sincerity of his protestant convictions, however, and in 1602 the church authorities appointed James Law, later bishop of Orkney, to act as his chaplain&#151;in effect he was a spy in the earl's house, charged with the daily catechizing of the family, removing suspected Catholics from the earl's service, and ensuring the appointment of reliable protestant pastors in the earl's territory. During this time Angus was reported to be wearing a cross openly and refusing to communicate in the kirk, and in 1608 the church once more began proceedings against him. He was briefly imprisoned in Glasgow before retiring to France. In 1609 he passed through England on his way to exile; he requested an interview with King James and also that he might take his second son with him to France, but permission for both was refused. Later that year, in October, he asked the king if he might return to Scotland to settle his affairs and to put his house in order, but this was once more denied.<br>
<br>A few of Angus's letters survive from this period in which he describes himself as old and sick, although he was no more than fifty-five years old. He lived near the abbey of St Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s in Paris, where he was recognized as a regular attender at mass and the monastic offices. He died in Paris on 3 March 1611, and was buried in St Christopher's aisle in the abbey church. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7934/', "William Douglas, first marquess of Douglas")</script>, erected a monument to his memory in the shape of a sarcophagus of black marble, on which lies a white marble effigy of the earl clad in armour, with an inscription recording his life and achievements. The earl's wife survived him and subsequently married James Hamilton. She and Angus had three sons and three daughters: William, who succeeded his father as eleventh earl; James, who was raised to the peerage by Charles I in 1641 as Lord Mordington and who married Anne, only child of Laurence, fifth Lord Oliphant; Sir Francis Douglas of Sandilands; Catherine; Mary, who became the second wife of Alexander Livingstone, second earl of Linlithgow; and Elizabeth, who married John Campbell, fiar of Cawdor.<br>
