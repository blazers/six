<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armitage,  Thomas Rhodes</span>  (1824&#150;1890), <span class="occ">campaigner for blind people</span>, was born at Tilgate, Sussex, on 2 April 1824, the sixth of seven sons of James Armitage (1793&#150;1872), a prosperous Leeds ironfounder, and his wife, Anne Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rhodes. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/650/', "Edward Armitage")</script>, history painter, was his eldest brother. The family had largely detached itself from its industrial roots, and for much of his early life Thomas lived with them abroad: first in Normandy and from 1833 in Frankfurt.<br>
<br>Armitage received his education at school in Offenbach and at the Sorbonne, before returning to study medicine at King's College, London, graduating MD from the University of London in 1852. He was licensed by the Royal College of Surgeons in 1848 and by the Royal College of Physicians in 1853. He probably practised initially in London hospitals, where he acquired a particular interest in the hydropathic treatment of fever patients; after studying this therapy in Paris and Vienna he published <span class="italic">Hydropathy as Applied to Acute Disease</span> in 1852. He was for a period attached to the Marylebone dispensary, and then served as assistant physician in the civil hospital of Renkioi, in Turkey, during the Crimean War, before setting up in a successful private practice in west London. His inherited and professional wealth was further enlarged by marriage, on 29 November 1860, to Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of Stanley Black; she brought with her an estate at Noan, near Thurles, co. Tipperary. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Armitage's career as a doctor was ended by 1866, when his sight&#151;which had been defective since his student days and perhaps earlier&#151;deteriorated to a point where he was unable to read. From this juncture he devoted himself to voluntary effort on behalf of the blind, and more especially to that large majority among them who suffered economic distress. He acted as a domiciliary almoner and committee member of an old-established evangelical charity, the Indigent Blind Visiting Society, and through this medium formed his own views on the education and welfare of the blind. In 1868 he recruited a number of blind friends and acquaintances in order to set up the British and Foreign Blind Association (BFBA), whose affairs he was to direct, as its honorary secretary, for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>The association was to be chiefly identified with the promotion of Braille as a system of relief type for the blind, and the production of literature and apparatus to this end. Its earliest object had been to displace rival forms of embossed print in existing schools for the blind. It set out to create &#145;the public opinion of the intelligent blind&#146; on the merits of different designs of embossed print by mobilizing a body of exclusively blind witnesses in a systematic process of adjudication  (T. R. Armitage, <span class="italic">The Education and Employment of the Blind</span>, 2nd edn, 1886, 39). From the early 1870s, however, the BFBA embraced a second cause, that of improving the opportunities of remunerative employment among adult men who had lost their sight, whether in childhood or maturity. In the case of the former Armitage urged the large potential of the field of music and piano tuning, &#145;certainly the most profitable as well as the pleasantest occupation open to the blind&#146;  (T. R. Armitage, <span class="italic">The Condition of the Blind in Great Britain and Ireland</span>, 1878, 10). During the 1880s he engaged in a third campaign, to support the labour of self-employed blind home workers through the &#145;Saxon system&#146;&#151;a machinery of aftercare, developed in Germany, that centred on the technical institutions that had trained the blind as adolescents.<br>
<br>On all these fronts the success enjoyed by the BFBA was principally owed to Armitage's own exertions. It was he who drafted its reports; produced most of the copy for its periodical, <span class="italic">Progress</span>; made rounds of visits to blind educational centres throughout the United Kingdom, in Europe, and the USA; delivered papers to international conferences, recruited patrons and corresponding members; and provided a substantial part of its financial support. His most important publication, <span class="italic">The Education and Employment of the Blind</span>, issued in two editions in 1871 and 1886, was at once a manifesto and a record of the association's aims and activities. It was Armitage, too, who, on behalf of the BFBA, organized the funding of what became the Royal Normal College for the Blind, conceived primarily as an advanced school of music. He persuaded the American teacher of music to the blind, Francis Joseph Campbell (1832&#150;1914) to become its principal when the college opened in 1872. Over the following years Armitage was said to have donated almost &pound;40,000 to the school's funds. His public standing was marked, in 1886, by his appointment (alongside Campbell) to represent the blind on the royal commission chaired by Lord Egerton of Tatton &#145;to inquire into the condition of the blind, the deaf, and dumb of the United Kingdom&#146;. The commission investigated the education of various classes of the disabled and reported in 1889.<br>
<br>By his later years the most prominent public spokesman of the blind population in Britain, Armitage died of heart failure at Cashel, co. Tipperary, on 23 October 1890, a few days after his horse fell and rolled over him. He was buried at Noan.<br>
<br>Although none of Armitage's pre-eminent goals had been wholly realized by the time of his death, they had all gained sufficient approval within the forum of blind charity to secure continued advance. The adoption of Braille for educational purposes made rapid progress in the 1880s, thanks to the increasing literary productivity of the BFBA. The Normal College had secured by 1890 the status of a premier music school, though it had not eliminated competition from other blind establishments. Aftercare arrangements for school leavers were endorsed by the royal commission, and effected gradually before the First World War. In all these enterprises, moreover, Armitage looked beyond national boundaries. He viewed the task of assisting the blind as one to be supported in every part of the world. The BFBA corresponded with institutions and fellow workers all over the world, converted Braille into several languages and alphabets, and supplied its books, music, and apparatus across the globe.<br>
<br>Armitage's ideas on blind welfare were not static; he had the faith of a typical mid-Victorian scientist in the progressive influence of knowledge. But he adhered to some constant moral and intellectual convictions. The literacy of the blind he valued especially as a means to self-improvement, and hence to social acceptance. &#145;A man is isolated by everything which renders the acquisition of knowledge difficult and tedious, and his isolation is diminished by everything which facilitates his power of self-education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Education and Employment of the Blind</span>, 41). But still more vital to the interests of the blind was their capacity to support themselves through work; and this outcome required an education wider than that provided by the conventional school fare. He urged that attention should be given to &#145;physical development, force of character, moral worth, absence of bad habits, knowledge of the world, insight into character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Progress</span>, Nov&#150;Dec 1886, transcript, 33). The social conditions of the blind would be improved, he believed, not by any concession of political or legal rights but by a consistent observance of generally accepted conventions of behaviour. He disapproved equally of mendicity, of the contraction of marriages between blind partners, of inattention to personal appearance and hygiene.<br>
<br>In these respects Armitage's outlook was that of a member of that urban &eacute;lite of philanthropic enterprise with which he was acquainted through his contacts with the Charity Organisation Society. On issues of blind education and employment he largely agreed with the society: that some part of instruction could be afforded in ordinary elementary schools; that technical education should be supported by state funds; that blind workshops should be assisted by the placement of government contracts. He was, on the other hand, more radical than most of his contemporaries in his approach to poor law reform, arguing that special workhouse accommodation should separate the aged and deserving blind from more disreputable paupers. In all this he conceived of a public and a voluntary sector co-operating to common ends. Philanthropic effort, selectively funded by public revenue, should continue to play a large role in the provision of services: for education, employment, pensions, home visiting. But he had little patience with small and inefficient agencies, or with charities conducted exclusively by sighted directors.<br>
<br>Armitage was clearly a man of great energy and wide interests. His private journal reflected his taste for travel, and his constant appetite for information on subjects of farming and estate management, as well as on the administration and operation of schools and institutions for the blind. He immersed himself in the technicalities of stereotype printing, of the manufacture of relief maps and writing machines, as well as of the construction of Braille in English and other languages. He emerges as a man of gregarious and equable temperament, with close and loyal friends as well as strong family ties.<br>
<br>Armitage was, at the same time, a paternalist radiating the confidence of personal authority. He ran the Indigent Blind Visiting Society and the BFBA almost as private feofs. The BFBA had its only office in his home, relied on the services of his own secretary, and consisted of a hand-picked executive communicating its actions to an inert membership. Its management was, on Armitage's death, passed to members of his family&#151;his brother as chairman, his widow as secretary. He can, in this sense, scarcely be termed the founder of the National Institute for the Blind, which evolved from his association only when it acquired leaders like Sir Arthur Pearson, more attuned to corporate life and with a greater flair for publicity. Armitage's achievements were the product rather of personal convictions and commitments; they testified to his own qualities: accumulated knowledge, pragmatic judgement, powers of persuasion, business capacity, and unremitting application. In the diverse and unregulated world of Victorian charity these were essential attributes.<br>
