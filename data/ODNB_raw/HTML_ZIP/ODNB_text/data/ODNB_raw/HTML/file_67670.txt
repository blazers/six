<span class="headword">Gore,  Margaret Wyndham</span>  (1913&#150;1993), <span class="occ">airwoman and osteopath</span>, was born on 24 January 1913 at Carclew, Brighton Road, Worthing, the daughter of William Wyndham Gore, a mining engineer, and his wife, Martha Lord. Known as Margot, she had one brother, her twin. The family moved to Ireland and she grew up enjoying an adventurous childhood, riding her pony to the hunt and ignoring physical discomforts.<br>
<br>Margot Gore had a little formal education but this ceased at sixteen when the family returned to England. Her desire was to study medicine, but her basic education and lack of financial support prevented this. Instead, she turned to her second enthusiasm&#151;flying. She had taken a menial job at Smithfield market in order to pay for her flying lessons. The formation of the Civil Air Guard in 1938, which provided subsidized flight training at civilian flying schools throughout the country, created a need for more instructors. This was the opportunity Margot needed, and by the outbreak of war she was instructing at Romford Flying Club, Essex. In spite of official disquiet, in January 1940 the women's section of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) with its initial intake of eight experienced airwomen became a reality under its commandant, Pauline Gower. They were to supplement the older airmen who formed the ATA. Margot Gore was recruited with the second intake in June 1940 and quickly adapted to the role of flying new and repaired Tiger Moths between factories and operational airfields.<br>
<br>In September 1941, when no. 15 ferry pool Hamble-on-Solent became the second all-women's pool, Margot Gore was promoted captain and became its commanding officer. Here her natural qualities of leadership together with the high standard she set herself as a pilot earned her the respect of her team of fellow pilots, engineers, and administrative staff. In spite of the exhausting flying duties, often interrupted by enemy action, and the discomfort of return journeys by train in wartime winters, Hamble is remembered by the women who served there as having a happy, harmonious atmosphere.<br>
<br>In 1943 Gore was the first woman to go to RAF Marston Moor class 5 unit to convert to flying the Handley Page four-engined Halifax bomber, quickly followed by a further ten women who made up the eleven ATA women qualified to fly any type of aircraft. Margot herself is believed to have been the first woman to fly the huge Boeing B17, generally known as the &#145;Flying Fortress&#146;. Once when flying an American Lockheed Hudson in the heavily defended Southampton&#150;Portsmouth area she had a narrow escape on encountering a large barrage balloon, rising just as she was approaching Eastleigh. She managed to clear the lethal cables by inches.<br>
<br>For her wartime services Gore was appointed MBE in 1945, and when the war ended she continued flying as chief flying instructor at the West London Flying Club at White Waltham, Berkshire. On the formation of the WAAF Voluntary Reserve in October 1947, the first recruits were Margot Gore and her former ATA colleague Joan Naylor.<br>
<br>By 1948 Gore began to consider again the possibility of a career in her earlier interest of medicine and, with encouragement from her close friend Ben Blediscoe, she decided on a career in osteopathy. With characteristic thoroughness, she studied chemistry, physics, and biology to higher certificate standard in order to gain entrance to the British School of Osteopathy (BSO) in September 1951. Qualifying in June 1954, she was awarded the gold medal as the outstanding student of her year. She started a private practice in Kensington but nevertheless kept close links with the BSO. Motivated no doubt by her own early lack of educational qualifications, she became in the late 1950s one of the five lecturers to introduce a basic science course for first-year students lacking the necessary A-levels or first MB science qualifications. In 1964 she was appointed head of the department of anatomy and physiology, and the following year was elected to the board of governing directors of the BSO, serving as the board representative on the council of the Osteopathic Educational Foundation. She became vice-chairman of the Osteopathic Educational Foundation in 1968. In 1970 she moved with her elderly mother to Cookley Green, Oxfordshire, and reduced her practising activities.<br>
<br>Gore's exceptional organizing ability was recognized when she served as chairman of the board of governing directors of the BSO (1978&#150;82). This was a key period in the school's history in which Gore led the team that realized the capital of the freehold of 16 Buckingham Gate and purchased a long lease on nos. 1&#150;4 Suffolk Street, thus increasing the student accommodation from 80 to 400 and enabling the clinic to take an extra 300 patients per week. It was this move in 1979, allied to the educational expansion and reorganization, that culminated in the validation of the diploma course to honours degree status. In recognition of her outstanding services to the school Margot was awarded an honorary fellowship of the BSO in 1983.<br>
<br>Margot Gore was an accomplished golfer and played at county level. In later life she became the ladies' captain of the Huntercombe Golf Club. She was a very private person and rarely attended social functions, and only those professional functions where her presence was expected. However, she co-operated in making documentary films concerning the ATA for the BBC in 1984 and recorded an interview with the Imperial War Museum in 1986. Margot Gore died of cancer on 20 August 1993 at the Sue Ryder Home, Nettlebed, Oxfordshire.<br>
