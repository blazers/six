<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quick, Sir  John</span>  (1852&#150;1932), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Australia</span>, was born at Trevega, Towednack, near St Ives, Cornwall, on 22 April 1852, the only child of John Quick, a farmer, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of James Quick, of Trevega. The family arrived in Victoria in October 1854 to search for gold, but the father died at Bendigo shortly after their arrival, leaving his wife and child badly off. Quick attended various schools until he was ten, and then, to help support his mother, worked successively in a foundry, a goldmine (above ground), and a printing press. Eventually, when he was seventeen, he became a reporter on the Bendigo <span class="italic">Independent</span> and, later, on the <span class="italic">Bendigo Advertiser</span>.<br>
<br>Quick decided to study law, and in 1874 entered the University of Melbourne. He graduated LLB in April 1877, and was admitted to the Victorian bar in June 1878. While studying law he had worked as a reporter with <span class="italic">The Age</span>; he now became leader of its parliamentary staff, and so entered political circles. He became a strong supporter of the &#145;liberal&#146; party of Graham Berry, advocating protection and land reform. Encouraged by Berry, he stood for the Victorian parliament in July 1880, and was returned as one of the members for Sandhurst (Bendigo). He began practice as a barrister at Bendigo, and in April 1882 was admitted to the degree of LLD by the University of Melbourne. On 24 December 1883 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1938), the daughter of Joseph Harris from Liskeard, Cornwall, a mine manager and former mayor of nearby Eaglehawk; they had no children of their own, but brought up a niece of Catherine Quick as their daughter. Quick built up a good legal practice in Bendigo, becoming senior partner of Quick, Hyett and Rymer there, while also, as an independent member, playing an active part in Victorian politics until he lost his seat in 1889.<br>
<br>Quick was keenly interested in Australian federation. The federal movement received popular impetus after July 1893, when a conference was held at Corowa of delegates from many voluntary organizations including the Australian Natives' Association, which Quick represented, despite not being Australian born. At Corowa Quick was chiefly responsible for the formulation and adoption of the idea that each colony should pass an act for the election of representatives to a federal convention; the draft constitution would then be submitted to a popular referendum. Quick drafted a model bill for submission to the six colonial parliaments, and for the next few years was tireless in getting these ideas adopted. He also proposed at an unofficial &#145;People's Federal Convention&#146;, held at Bathurst in November 1896, that the senate in the federal constitution be elected democratically by the people, not by state legislatures. In 1897 he was one of the ten Victorian delegates elected to the constitutional convention, and his work for federation was recognized by his being knighted on 1 January 1901.<br>
<br>In 1901 Quick was returned unopposed to the commonwealth parliament for Bendigo, and held the seat until 1913. From December 1904 to July 1907 he was chairman of a royal commission on commonwealth tariffs, whose rather inconclusive reports were ignored when in 1908 the government decided to impose higher duties, with preferential rates to Great Britain. Quick helped to bring about the Deakin&#150;Cook (anti-Labor) &#145;fusion&#146; government of 1909&#150;10, in which he gained ministerial office as postmaster-general. On his defeat in 1913 he retired from politics, and he devoted himself to his legal practice and business interests until June 1922, when he became deputy president of the commonwealth arbitration court. Here, until his retirement in 1930, his even-handed judgments won him wide respect.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Quick retained his interest in literature, from his presidency of the Shakespeare and Pickwick societies in Bendigo to his membership of the Author's Society in Melbourne, where he was also patron of the Australian Literary Society and began to compile a bibliography of Australian literature (completed and published in 1940). His other chief publications were <span class="italic">The History of Land Tenure in the Colony of Victoria</span> (1883), <span class="italic">The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth</span> (with Sir Robert Garran, 1901), <span class="italic">The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth</span> (with Sir Littleton Groom, 1904), and <span class="italic">Legislative Powers of the Commonwealth and the States of Australia</span> (1919). They show his unmatched grasp of constitutional matters and his desire that the public of the new commonwealth be well informed on such matters.<br>
<br>Quick died on 17 June 1932 at his home in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell, survived by his wife. He was buried on 20 June in Back Creek cemetery, Bendigo. His colleague Garran likened himself to the &#145;junior partner of a steam-roller&#146;, but undoubtedly Quick's painstaking, meticulous, and determined work enabled the federal movement to achieve success earlier than it would otherwise have done.<br>
