<span class="headword">Campbell,  Ambrose</span>  (1919&#150;2006), <span class="occ">musician and bandleader</span>, was born Oladipupo Adekoya Campbell in Lagos, Nigeria, on 19 August 1919, the third of four sons in the family of six children of James, G. M., or Adekoya Campbell, a minister in the West African Episcopal church, and his wife, Phoebe Ibidun Adekoya. His father was an Ijebu of Sierra Leonean descent and his mother was Ijebu-Yoruba. Oladipupo (Oladipo) Campbell sang in his father's church choir as a child, and at night, accompanied by his fellow choristers, escaped from the family compound to join seamen and &#145;rascal boys&#146; at the palm-wine shops where they gathered to drink and make music, playing guitars and simple percussion instruments. Singing and playing on a tin can with these well-travelled older men, he absorbed a wide variety of cultural influences, and adopted the name Ambrose to avoid bringing his family into disrepute: his father believed that playing music made his son a beggar. He left home aged fourteen in reaction to his father's restrictions, and found shelter in the home of the Nigerian nationalist Herbert Heelas Macaulay. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed as a newspaper printer. He bought a guitar but when he joined an itinerant band he was playing a tambourine, known as &#145;eight corners&#146; in Lagos, where it was an instrument of symbolic significance believed to have the power to stimulate mental and spiritual consciousness. With the Jolly Boys Orchestra, a group distinguished by the penny-whistle flute of Sunday Harbour Giant, he played for tips, and made his first recording in 1939.<br>
<br>In wartime Campbell found work as a seaman. He saw England for the first time in 1940; he jumped ship in Liverpool two years later and moved to London. A slight physique ill equipped him for seafaring, but on a third voyage he reached South America, where he encountered Latin American music, and New York, where he and his shipmates played their guitars and drums in Harlem bars. He was greatly affected by the deaths of comrades at sea and did not want to return. He managed to prosper in wartime London in the face of widespread racial antipathy and deprivation, and made a mark in Camden Town, where he joined Cockney pub &#145;sing-alongs&#146; and played music with friends. In 1942 he formed a relationship with Ida Margaret Gould (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), a restaurant waitress, and daughter of Noah Gould, a general dealer. They had a daughter, Dawn Adeyinka (<i>b</i>. 1944), and a son, Ambrose Oladipo (<i>b</i>. 1945).<br>
<br>After the war Campbell formed a band with percussionist friends in response to taunts about the integrity of African music; he was joined by the guitarist Brewster Hughes, another member of the Jolly Boys from Lagos. They played &#145;highlife&#146;, the popular west African dance music, for student dances, and in 1946 accompanied the Ballets N&egrave;gres, the first black British dance company, and visited Paris. With Campbell playing guitar as well as percussion, and after several changes of personnel, the band became the West African Rhythm Brothers, the name under which most of their 10 inch 78 rpm shellac records were made. Campbell's attractive singing voice, with its &#145;sad, strong, life-loving tones&#146;  (MacInnes, &#145;Highlife Today&#146;), marked him out as leader, although Hughes was the group's main guitarist and its spokesman. The association with dancers continued when they formed a working relationship with the African-American choreographer and dance-teacher Buddy Bradley. In 1949 Campbell concentrated on the guitar. He studied with Ade Bashorun, a Lagosian who had joined the band playing bongos, and with the Trinidadian jazz musician Lauderic Caton, and was seen playing this instrument when the band made their television d&eacute;but in 1948 supporting the work of the Nigerian sculptor Ben Enwonwu.<br>
<br>In London Campbell's joyful music was an antidote to post-war austerity. More than two decades before the popularity of Afro-beat as a genre, he reinvigorated popular music with the gentle &#145;sunshine&#146; sound of highlife, singing in Yoruba and accompanied by plangent guitars and by drummers who played melodies as well as keeping time. In 1952 the band found a base in London's West End when the Nigerian entrepreneur Ola Dosunmu opened the Abalabi, immortalized as the Beni Bronze by MacInnes (1957). Musicians, journalists, jazz fans, and intellectuals went there and to its successor, Club Afrique, to dance and drink, to savour the Nigerian atmosphere and food, and mix with Soho's African contingent. Nor did Campbell neglect the wider African community; his was the first visiting African band to play in Manchester's Moss Side.<br>
<br>The West African Rhythm Brothers became a ubiquitous presence in jazz circles, where their intricate &#145;Afro-rhythms&#146; coincided with a growing awareness of the African origins of black American music. Yoruba music was rooted in religious symbolism and cultural function, but in Britain Campbell moved beyond tradition. The influence of jazz and calypso was strong in west Africa during this period, and Campbell's own association with jazz musicians fired his imagination, leading him to augment the band with Caribbean instrumentalists&#151;their clarinet, saxophone, and muted trumpet attracted a wider audience&#151;and Adam Fiberesima, a Nigerian Ijo whose percussive piano playing emphasized the Latin American element present in highlife and built a fuller sound. When the band visited Nigeria in 1957 Campbell recruited exponents of the talking drum (<i>gan-gan</i>), in order, he said, to further &#145;enrich&#146; the texture.<br>
<br>In 1962 Campbell spent six months on Italy's Adriatic coast, where his audience included Jacqueline Kennedy, but back in London the growing popularity of music based on rock 'n' roll forced him to diversify from his earlier repertory and he flirted with a group of younger musicians, and played the twist. On 12 December 1964 he married Elizabeth Jane Graham-Smith (<i>b</i>. 1940), a riding instructor, and daughter of Richard Alan Graham-Smith, schoolmaster. They had two sons, Danny Adekoya (<i>b</i>. 1962) and Christopher Oladipo (<i>b</i>. 1964). When they separated Campbell formed a nightclub act with Cleo Howard, an Englishwoman whom he taught to play drums.<br>
<br>Gentle, balding, and softly spoken, Campbell was a dreamer who lived for the day. He survived through his ability to attract support and friendship across class and cultural divides. The record producer Denny Cordell was an admirer, and in 1972 he persuaded Campbell to move to the USA and join him and the Oklahoman singer and pianist Leon Russell in a production company. He toured and recorded with Russell's band as a percussionist, returning briefly to Nigeria in 1979 to refute rumours of his death, then moved to Nashville and continued working with Russell and other popular musicians. In 1980, in order to support the man he claimed as his spiritual adviser, Russell opened the Ambrose Campbell World Video Studio in Burbank, California. In the USA Campbell married Antoinette (surname unknown) about 1973; their daughter, Funmilayo, was born in 1976. In 2004 he returned to England, precipitating a revival of interest in his work; he was interviewed and some of his recordings were reissued on CD. He died in Plymouth on 22 June 2006 from an acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and cancer of the stomach.<br>
<br>Campbell occupied a unique position as a traditional African artist. Respected by the jazz community and admired for his &#145;authenticity&#146; by musicians like the saxophonist Ronnie Scott, who described Campbell as &#145;a bit special &hellip; a musicologist&#146;  (interview with V. Wilmer, 1991), he was exposed to jazz modernism, itself in part an outcome of African-American movements for self-determination and racial equality. Appreciation of his music developed in a context in which Afro-Cuban rhythms, associated with black cultural nationalism, crossed the Atlantic and remained a component in popular music. Predicting figures of future significance, in 1952 the critic Ernest Borneman chose Campbell's drummers for their potential to &#145;provide tomorrow's British horn-men with backing as interesting as any that [the Cuban percussionists] Machito and Chano Pozo &hellip; provided for [Charlie] Parker and [Dizzy] Gillespie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Melody Maker</span>, 22 March 1952).<br>
