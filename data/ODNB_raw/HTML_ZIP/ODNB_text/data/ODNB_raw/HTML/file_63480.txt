<span class="headword">Murray <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Norman; <em>other married name </em>Bennet]</span>,  Grace</span>  (1715&#150;1803), <span class="occ">follower of Methodism</span>, daughter of Robert and Grace Norman, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 23 January 1715 into a Church of England family. At twenty-one she married Alexander Murray (<i>d</i>. 1742), a sea captain, from a respectable Scottish family which had lost fortune and position through loyalty to the Stuart cause. The young couple engaged in worldly pursuits, but while her husband was at sea Grace heard John Wesley and George Whitefield preach. She was converted in 1739 and received by Charles Wesley into the London Wesleyan Methodist Society, where her name is included on the Foundery class lists of 1742. John Wesley made her one of the Foundery bandleaders. When her husband was lost at sea in 1742 Grace returned to Newcastle, where she became a class leader and was appointed housekeeper when the Orphan House in Newcastle opened in 1745. Wesley encouraged her to travel around that area, where she showed particular skill in leading women's classes. He took Grace as one of his travelling companions on his third visit to Ireland (April&#150;July 1749). On their return Grace travelled on her own through south-east England before going back to Newcastle. Although she never attempted to preach, her work was highly regarded and done &#145;by Mr. Wesley's direction&#146;  (Bennet, 19).<br>
<br>John Wesley contemplated marrying Grace and she was probably the nearest he came to having a true love, but the affair became very complicated. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37180/', "John Bennet (1715&#150;1759)")</script>, one of Wesley's most trusted and successful preachers, had fallen in love with Grace while being nursed by her at the Orphan House in 1746. They corresponded for the next two years. In August 1748 Wesley too was nursed by Grace, proposed to her, and they entered into what Wesley believed to be a formal contract of marriage on the basis of his promise to marry her. In September John Bennet also proposed and she accepted, telling him she was not committed to Wesley. For almost a year she swung between the two and in July 1749 pressed Wesley into a contract <i>de praesenti</i>, effectively a private marriage ceremony. However, it seems that Wesley's indecision, coupled with Charles Wesley's fears about the marriage, prevented Wesley from fulfilling his intentions. Charles acted swiftly and on 3 October 1749 in St Andrew's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, Grace married Bennet in his presence. For a while it seemed there would be a serious rift between John, Charles, John Bennet, and Grace, but George Whitefield acted as reconciler. Wesley's distress at losing Grace was evident in the poem he wrote just after the event.<br>
<br>In 1752 John Bennet, who had already been moving towards Calvinism, seceded from the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion and finally settled down as an Independent minister at Warburton, near Warrington. He died there in 1759 aged forty-five. After several years Grace rejoined the Wesleyan Methodists, meeting Wesley for the last time in 1788 in London. She died on 23 February 1803 and was buried in the Independent burial-ground at Chinley, Derbyshire.<br>
