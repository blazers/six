<div class="para">
<span class="headword">May,  Pamela</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Doris Maud May]</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">ballet dancer</span>, was born on 30 May 1917 in San Fernando, Trinidad, the daughter of Reginald Henry May, civil engineer. She moved to England with her parents when she was four. After local schooling and some early ballet lessons, then courses at the Royal Academy of Dancing, she was admitted, aged sixteen, to the ballet school founded by Ninette de Valois as a feeder for her newly formed company at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. De Valois was always on the lookout for new talent, and never more so than when her young company lost its prima ballerina, Alicia Markova, who left in 1935 to lead a new company with the dancer Anton Dolin. During her training May caught the eye of de Valois, who first thought to groom her as Markova's successor. That distinction was bestowed instead on Margaret Hookham, later known as Margot Fonteyn. May became Fonteyn's close associate and lifelong friend, usually alternating with her in the principal roles in the main ballet classics, and sharing accommodation with her on tour.<br>
<br>May was already getting her first experience of solo roles, dancing the Prelude in <span class="italic">Les sylphides</span> while still a student paying her course fees at the Royal Academy of Dancing. Her formal d&eacute;but from the <i>corps de ballet</i> was in the prominent <i>pas de trois</i> in <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> in its first production by the Sadler's Wells Company in 1934. Up to this point she had been billed in programmes as Doris May, but de Valois, who liked her solo dancers to have mellifluous names, decreed that Doris should choose a different first name. According to Mary Clarke's history of the company, &#145;after weeks of indecision&#146;, Doris decided that she would call herself Angela May and went to de Valois to announce her great decision, only to be told cheerfully, &#145;It's too late, dear. The programmes have been printed and you are down as Pamela&#146;  (Clarke, 80). So Pamela May she became for the rest of her long professional career. In her <span class="italic">Invitation to the Ballet</span> (1937), de Valois described her as &#145;beautifully made, a graceful and talented handful&#146;. May quickly captivated audiences with her lyrical gaiety, stunning glamour, and immense charm.<br>
<br>From the first May was especially admired in ballet's equivalent of theatrical soubrette roles, notably the spirited and wily Swanilda in <span class="italic">Copp&eacute;lia</span>. Indeed, Sir Peter Wright, director laureate of the Birmingham Royal Ballet, said that it was her performance in this role that motivated him to become a dancer: &#145;She always made dancing so exciting and such fun that I longed to be up there on the stage with her&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Stage</span>, 16 June 2005). Conscious of her femininity, she projected immense vitality across the footlights. According to several reports she favoured relaxation from the stage by engaging in strip-poker with her fellow players including, on occasion, Frederick Ashton, the dancers Robert Helpmann and Michael Somes, and the music director Constant Lambert. Yet at the same time May developed a purity of classical line and style that led Mary Clarke, in her account of the Sadler's Wells Ballet, to describe her as &#145;the most purely classical of English dancers&#146;  (Clarke, 204). Some of this quality no doubt derived from an interlude in Paris in 1935 when Fonteyn's mother, prompted by friendship rather than potential rivalry, escorted her daughter, with May and June Brae (another prominent teenage ballerina in the company, with whom May had been paired as the Red Girls in Ashton's <span class="italic">Les patineurs</span>), to Paris to take classes with eminent emigr&eacute; Russian ballerinas from the former St Petersburg Maryinsky company, Lubov Egorova, Mathilde Kschessinskaya, and Olga Preobrazhenska. This the girls managed to do without exceeding their very limited funds.<br>
<br>Another aspect of May's accomplishment was her skill in responding to new choreography. She had already shared with Fonteyn the role of the voluptuous Creole Girl in Ashton's <span class="italic">A Day in a Southern Port</span> (1931, later called <span class="italic">Rio Grande</span>) and he featured her again in <span class="italic">Le baiser de la f&eacute;e</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">Apparitions</span> (1936). De Valois cast her in a solo role in <span class="italic">The Gods go a-Begging</span> (1936) and the next year gave her a created role as the warmly supportive Red Queen in her new ballet, <span class="italic">Checkmate</span>. Also that year May was praised for her appealing account of the forlorn Violet forever pursuing the timidly elusive Ernest in Ashton's <span class="italic">A Wedding Bouquet</span>. In his <span class="italic">Horoscope</span> (1938) the poetry of her curving <i>ports de bras</i> in the role of the Moon made a lasting impression. Other roles that brought her to wide attention included that of the eighteenth-century coquette Mlle Th&eacute;odore in de Valois's <span class="italic">The Prospect before Us</span> (1940), a title of some irony as the shades of the Second World War closed in. Also in 1940 Ashton created his barefoot <span class="italic">Dante Sonata</span>, where May was given a memorably anguished solo, &#145;rocking back and forth in frustration and grief&#146;  (Anderson, 70). This wartime ballet was successfully revived with Pamela May's help by Birmingham Royal Ballet in 2001. Meanwhile the Sadler's Wells Company had in 1937 paid one of its regular visits to the Arts Theatre, Cambridge, where the prettiest girls were often invited to stay on to attend the May balls and where that year, by coincidence, both May and June Brae met future husbands at the same party. On 25 May 1940 May married, at All Souls' Church, Marylebone, Painton Sidney Cowen (1917/18&#150;1942), a lieutenant in the Royal Marines, and son of Walter Painton Cowen, mining engineer. After her marriage May danced the beautiful Euridice in de Valois's <span class="italic">Orpheus and Euridice</span> (1941) and a sensuous duet, startling for its time, with Somes (a former lover) in Ashton's <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span> (1941). May took leave from the company to have a son, also named Painton, whose father was reported killed in action three weeks after the baby was born.<br>
<br>Eventually May felt again the call of the stage and returned to Sadler's Wells, first with the opera company, dancing in the circus divertissement of Smetana's <span class="italic">The Bartered Bride</span>. She subsequently responded to an invitation from de Valois to rejoin the ballet company, but found a lack of stamina inhibited her attempt at the full-length <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>, which she then split instead with a newly rising young star, Moira Shearer. As May regained her strength she was once more cast in ballerina roles, and when the company reopened the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1946 with its production of <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> in a run of continuous performances, May alternated night after night with Fonteyn as Aurora (as she did again during the company's groundbreaking first season in New York in 1949). Ashton too was keen to involve her in his new plans, and he took May to possibly the peak of her career when he cast her with Fonteyn and Shearer as the three ballerinas in his <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> (1946), his first new ballet after his return from war service, which many consider his greatest work. His celebrated designer, Sophie Fedorovich, took May aside during rehearsals and said to her, &#145;Margot is dark, Moira is red and you are &hellip; mouse!&#146;  (Anderson, 93), persuading her to become blonde for more effective contrast at the first performance, a colouring May then retained. Ashton followed up May's success in this role by creating for her the role of the Fairy Godmother in <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> (1948), Ashton's first three-act ballet.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1946 May married Charles Howard Gordon, a civil servant, the host of the Cambridge party for the dancers six years previously. They had a daughter, Caroline, and May found lasting happiness in her marriage and in family life. After her marriage she enjoyed continuing success in the Royal Ballet for several years more as she moved into mature character roles like the Princess-Mother in <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> and the Queen in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>. To all of these she brought an impressive dignity and forceful presence, and she was highly praised for preserving the style of traditional classic mime.<br>
<br>In 1954, after her retirement from the stage, May was a teacher at the Royal Ballet School until 1977. Her students respected and admired her authority and her meticulous care in the preparation of roles, which she liked to explore in depth, as well as her assurance of technique. She received the highest distinction in the British dance profession, the Queen Elizabeth II coronation award from the Royal Academy of Dancing, in 1976, and became a governor of the Royal Ballet companies and vice-president of the Royal Academy of Dancing. She was appointed OBE in 1998. She was a close and sympathetic companion to de Valois in the latter's failing health. She herself moved from London to Birmingham to be near her daughter. She died on 6 June 2005 at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham following a stroke. A service of thanksgiving was held at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, on 19 September 2005. She was survived by both children.<br>
