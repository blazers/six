<span class="headword">Comyn,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Red Comyn]</span>, lord of Badenoch  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1277), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Richard Comyn (<i>d</i>. 1244&times;9), and was also nephew (and heir) to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6049/', "Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith (d. 1258)")</script>, and nephew to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6042/', "Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1289)")</script>. John had two brothers, William and Richard. He was twice married, his first wife being Eva, his second Alicia (probably de Lindsay, of Lamberton).<br>
<br>John Comyn had inherited important lands in Tynedale in Northumberland and in southern Scotland (in Dumfriesshire, Roxburghshire, and Peeblesshire) by <i>c</i>.1250, and the lordships of Badenoch and Lochaber in northern Scotland after 1258. The Tynedale and southern Scottish lands had been acquired by John's great-grandfather Richard (<i>d</i>. 1178), who founded the family's secular fortunes through favour with the Scottish royal family. Richard's son, William, extended the family's landed acquisitions northwards through the lordships of Lenzie and Kirkintilloch (<i>c</i>.1200), the earldom of Buchan (<i>c</i>.1212), and the lordship of Badenoch (<i>c</i>.1229) for his son Walter (the future earl of Menteith). William had two wives and two large families. The earldom of Buchan, which he acquired through marriage to his second wife, Countess Marjory, was inherited by Alexander, the eldest son of this marriage. The Tynedale and southern Scottish lands, with the Badenoch lordship, descended to John Comyn through Walter Comyn, the eldest surviving son of William Comyn's first marriage. After Walter's death in 1258, John gained the headship of the senior, Badenoch, branch of the family and became the first Red Comyn. This sobriquet, derived from the heraldic colour of the Badenoch branch of the family, was handed down to his successors as head of the senior branch, to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6045/', "John Comyn, known as the Competitor (d. c.1302)")</script>, and to his grandson, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6046/', "John Comyn (d. 1306)")</script>. Comyn failed, however, to inherit the earldom of Menteith after first accusing the countess and her new husband, Sir John Russell, of poisoning Earl Walter in 1258, and then forcing them to resign the earldom. The compromise decision reached by the king and a Comyn-dominated council in 1260&#150;61 was to give the earldom to Walter Stewart (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1296).<br>
<br>John Comyn had been a regular member of a Comyn &#145;party&#146; under the leadership of Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith, his uncle, in the politically disturbed years 1242&#150;58, when the power of the Comyns in the north was threatened by the Bisset and Durward families, and their political dominance of the aristocratic community was threatened by Alexander II's appointment of Alan Durward as justiciar of Scotia <i>c</i>.1244. John Comyn personally participated in the hounding of the Bissets in 1242 and with other members of the Comyn following made a bond of good behaviour in 1244. The death of Alexander II in 1249 and the minority of Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1249&#150;86) intensified the rivalry between the Comyns under Earl Walter and their opponents, especially Alan Durward, for political leadership in Scotland. When the Comyns regained control of Scottish government, with English help, in 1251, John Comyn was part of this government. When they lost this leadership in 1255, John Comyn participated in the kidnapping of the young Alexander III and his queen during the successful counter-coup of 1257, and was named as justiciar of Galloway in the Comyn-led confederation of nobles which made a treaty with the Welsh princes in 1258.<br>
<br>The decision to curb John Comyn's power in 1260&#150;61, by not allowing him to succeed to the earldom of Menteith, was an acknowledgement by the magnates, including fellow Comyns, that John's reputation for bellicose behaviour was substantially true. Fordun regarded him as &#145;a man prone to robbery and rashness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronica gentis Scottorum</span>, 2.293). The setback of 1260&#150;61 probably explains why John Comyn appeared irregularly in the royal circle during the 1260s. Instead he sought advancement and adventure in England. He was in the English royal household in 1262, 1264, and 1265, and fought for Henry III at the battle of Lewes in 1264, where he was captured. The English records from 1260 to 1275 testify to the rich rewards available. Comyn received a confirmation of his important Tynedale lands in 1262 and permission to fortify his Northumberland manor house at Tarset in 1267. He was given numerous privileges in the royal forests, a yearly fee of &pound;50, and in 1266 was promised (though never received) 300 librates of land &#145;for his faithful service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1258&#150;66</i>, 551).<br>
<br>Comyn's military expertise featured further in Scottish record. In 1269 he upset the earl of Atholl by building a castle at Blair in Atholl. The matter was settled by the king and his council. It seems that two great castles of Badenoch and Lochaber, namely Lochindorb and Inverlochy&#151;with Ruthven a possible third&#151;were also founded by John Comyn and that, with Blair, they formed part of a strategic castle building plan in the north. Comyn featured prominently as justiciar of Galloway in a royal expedition against Man in 1275.<br>
<br>John Comyn, who was a benefactor to Melrose Abbey and to the churches at Durham and Glasgow, died <i>c</i>.1277. He left five sons: John the Competitor, who married Eleanor (Marjory), sister of John de Balliol, the future king of Scots; William, lord of Kirkintilloch; Alexander; another John (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1295); and Robert (<i>d</i>. 1306). According to Andrew Wyntoun, he had four daughters (the <span class="italic">Scots peerage</span> mentions a fifth), who married Richard Siward, Geoffrey Mowbray, Alexander of Argyll, and Andrew Murray, father of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50013/', "Andrew Murray")</script> who died in 1297.<br>
