<span class="headword">Playford,  John</span>  (1622/3&#150;1686/7), <span class="occ">music publisher</span>, was born in Norwich, a son of John Playford (<i>d</i>. 1639), mercer of Norwich, and his second wife. He may have been educated at the almonry, or cathedral choir school, in Norwich and on 23 March 1640 was apprenticed to the London stationer John Benson. He was granted his freedom on 5 April 1647 and leased a shop in or adjoining the porch of the Temple Church, where he traded for the rest of his working life.<h2>
<a name="Earlypublications"></a>Early publications</h2>Playford's earliest publications included pamphlets revealing royalist sympathies, such as <span class="italic">A perfect narrative of the whole proceedings of the high co<sup>rt</sup> of justice in the tryall of the king, &amp;c.</span>, registered with the Stationers' Company on 22 January 1649. Such activities led to the issue of a warrant for his arrest: the precise consequences are unknown, but his career seems to have been interrupted until late 1650, when <span class="italic">The English Dancing Master</span> was registered on 7 November. Appearing in ten editions between 1651 and 1698, it contained instructions for the dances themselves as well as their melodies. It was followed in 1651 by <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span>, consisting of three sections containing music in tablature for lyra viol, dances in two parts, and a collection of catches, each developed in later, separate publications. He went on to produce many volumes of vocal and instrumental music, sometimes in partnership with other stationers, including his master Benson and his own former apprentice Zacharia Watkins. In 1653 he issued <span class="italic">A catalogue of all the musick-bookes that have been printed in England, either for voyce or instruments</span>, substantially a historic record rather than an advertisement of material currently available  (BL, Harleian MS 5936, no. 421). His comprehensive musical primer, <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Skill of Musick</span>, incorporating material by Thomas Campion and Christopher Simpson, first published in 1654, was still available in 1730, the twelfth edition of 1694 having been revised by Henry Purcell.<br>
<br>About the beginning of 1653 Playford married Hannah (<i>c</i>.1633&#150;1679), schoolmistress, probably the daughter of Benjamin Allen and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57039/', "Hannah Allen")</script>, booksellers, of Pope's Head Alley. The Playfords' first son, Samuel, was baptized in the Temple Church on 29 December 1653, and he was followed by Thomas (born 9 April, baptized 22 April 1656), Henry, the only child to survive to adulthood<a href="#cosubject_22373"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Margaret (born 6 October, baptized 13 October 1659). On 29 October 1653 Playford was appointed clerk of the Temple Church, and in the same year he stated that his house was &#145;in three Leg Alley, in Fetter Lane, next doore to the red Lyon&#146; near St Dunstan-in-the-West  (<span class="italic">A Catalogue of All the Musick-Bookes</span>). Samuel was buried at St Dunstan's on 5 January 1655, but died in the Temple, where the Playfords may have moved; they did not, however, live above the shop, which was certainly small and probably a single-storey structure. About 1656 they took possession of a house in Islington in which Hannah Playford ran a boarding-school, belatedly advertised in <span class="italic">Choice Ayres</span> (1679), where girls might &#145;be instructed in all manner of curious work, as also reading, writing, musick, dancing, and the French tongue&#146;. Four further children of John and Hannah were baptized or buried at Islington between 1664 and 1670.<h2>
<a name="TheStationersCompany"></a>The Stationers' Company</h2>Playford was admitted to the livery of the Stationers' Company on 20 April 1661 and from the same year was permitted to exercise the company's monopoly in the publication of metrical psalm books, the change in his fortunes at the Restoration perhaps being related to his ability to help with the re-establishment of choral services in cathedrals and at the Chapel Royal. On 13 March 1661 he was paid &pound;38 10<i>s</i>. for providing material for the Chapel Royal; he supplied copies of John Barnard's <span class="italic">First Book of Selected Church Musick</span> to Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey; and in a petition granted on 1 March 1674 he claimed that he &#145;did procure both the Organ and Books belonging to your majesties Chappell Royall w<sup>ch</sup> had bin Embezled&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 29/360, no. 215; see Ashbee, 8.216 and 337). Direct intervention from the king certainly brought about Playford's election to the court of assistants of the Stationers' Company on 20 June 1681. From 1675 onwards Playford held a share in the company's English stock.<br>
<br>In several publications Playford advertised ruled paper, ink, bound manuscript books, and music &#145;prick'd&#146; in manuscript, the last of these enabling him to offer for sale music too elaborate or limited in appeal to justify a printed edition. Three sources have long been associated with him: BL, Add. MS 31430, containing instrumental works by William Gregory, Matthew Locke, and John Jenkins; Glasgow University Library, Euing Music Collection, MSS R.d.58&#150;61, a set of vocal partbooks dating from about 1659 and associated with the Old Jewry Catch Club, of which Playford was a member; and Paris, Conservatoire, MS R&eacute;s. 2489, a song book. Comparison of the text hand of these manuscripts with Playford's handwritten dedications in British Library copies of <span class="italic">Psalms &amp; Hymns in Solemn Musick</span> (K.1.i.19: 1671) and <span class="italic">The Second Book of the Pleasant Musical Companion</span> (K.1.d.24: 1686), and with the registers of the Temple Church during the period when Playford was clerk, leaves no doubt that they were copied by him. In turn, the Glasgow partbooks in particular suggest that his publishing activities were related to musical recreations in which he himself took part. Similarly, his interest in psalm books probably stems from his office as clerk of the Temple Church.<h2>
<a name="Playfordspublishingpractice"></a>Playford's publishing practice</h2>Playford usually employed a single printing shop in Little Britain, described in an advertisement at the end of <span class="italic">The Order of Performing the Divine Service in Cathedrals and Collegiate Chappels</span> bound with the 1679 edition of the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> as &#145;the ancient and only Printing-House in England, for Variety of Musick and Workmen that understand it&#146; as well as &#145;the usual House for printing Mathematical Bookes&#146;. It belonged in 1651 to Thomas Harper, succeeded in 1656 by William Godbid and in 1679 by Godbid's widow, Anne, and his former apprentice <a href="#cosubject_22375">John Playford the younger [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Playford's publications were not technically innovative, and most were set in movable type using an old-fashioned Granjon typeface. Engraving was employed in special circumstances: for the 1663 <span class="italic">Musick's Hand-Maide</span>, a keyboard book in which chords and six-line staves made ordinary music type impracticable, and for a reissue in 1650 of William Child's psalm book of 1639, for which Playford had acquired the existing plates. The title-page of Purcell's <span class="italic">Sonnata's of III Parts</span> of 1683 suggests that Playford published the work on the composer's behalf without financial risk to himself; nevertheless, he played an active part in preparing the edition, because the engraving (by Thomas Cross) imitates John Playford's musical handwriting and was probably modelled on a manuscript exemplar in his hand.<br>
<br>Playford marketed music as a commercial proposition, aiming for wide distribution in an amateur, middle-class market, and it has sometimes been suggested that his sale of popular material might have undermined and devalued an established musical tradition  (Krummel, 114). The criticism overlooks both the number of serious publications issued by Playford or with his help and the varied repertory circulating in manuscript in the later seventeenth century, some of it available from Playford's shop. Arthur Bedford's complaint in <span class="italic">The Great Abuse of Musick</span> (1711) that Playford &#145;had spar'd no Cost or Pains to oblige the World with Smut and Profaneness&#146;  (1.67) is an early example of a changing sensibility about obscene catches considered acceptable in male society in Playford's lifetime. In the 1670s Playford planned to print &#145;a large collection of Full Service and Anthems (with the organ parts) of Four Parts for Sides&#146; (that is, divided between cantoris and decanis for cathedrals) which might have established him as a successor to Barnard: he described this project in his petition granted in 1674, and in the advertisement already mentioned in the 1679 <span class="italic">Introduction</span> he stated that he abandoned it &#145;not finding incouragement thereto&#146;.<br>
<br>After Hannah Playford's death in October 1679 the house in Islington was offered to let for the remaining sixteen years of Playford's lease. Playford moved to a house in Arundel Street &#145;near the Thames side, the lower end, over against the George&#146;, in the parish of St Clement Danes, and in the preface to the fifth book of <span class="italic">Choice Ayres</span> (1684) announced that because of &#145;Age, and the Infirmities of Nature&#146; he was handing the main responsibility for his business over to his son Henry in partnership with Robert Carr. His will, made on 5 November 1686, was neither signed nor witnessed and was not proved until August 1694, when his former apprentice John Bligh and servant Susanna Hammerton testified to its handwriting  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/422, fols. 79<i>v</i>&#150;80<i>v</i>); he refers to &#145;losses crosses and sickness&#146; since the death of his wife and warns that his estate will &#145;come short of the expectation of many of my friends and acquaintance&#146;. No record of his death or burial exists, but he must have died after 24 December 1686, when his last Stationers' Company dividend was collected, and before 7 February 1687, when his share was reallocated to William Cooper. His wish to be interred in the Temple Church must have been respected, because Henry Playford asked in his own will made in 1690 to be buried there next to his father. Playford seems to have been friendly with leading musicians of his time, including John Blow and Henry Purcell, to whom he left mourning rings; in 1687 Purcell composed an elegy on his death, &#145;Gentle shepherds, you that know&#146;, with a text by Nahum Tate.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22375"></a><span class="headword">John Playford</span>  (1650&#150;1685), <span class="occ">music printer</span>, born on 13 March 1650, was a son of the publisher's elder brother or half-brother Matthew Playford, rector of Great Stanmore, Middlesex, and his wife, Eleanor. He was bound apprentice to William Godbid, his uncle's main printer, on 6 November 1666 and freed on 1 December 1673. After Godbid's death in 1679 he worked until 1683 with Anne Godbid, but thereafter ran the Little Britain printing house on his own. His will, proved on 29 April 1685, left his copyhold estate to his mother, then married to Randolph Nicholl, and after her death to his unmarried sister Eleanor. &#145;E. Playford&#146; is named as one of the publishers of Daniel Newhouse's <span class="italic">The Whole Art of Navigation</span> (1685), and the younger Eleanor seems for a time to have managed the printing shop herself, but as she was not a stationer's widow she was not allowed to continue and advertised the printing shop for sale in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> for 3&#150;6 May 1686. Unable to find a buyer for its specialized equipment, Eleanor unsuccessfully petitioned the king for permission to run the shop herself: she later married William Walker, and the apprentice of the same name bound to Henry Playford on 1 December 1707 was presumably their son.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22373"></a><span class="headword">Henry Playford</span>  (1657&#150;1709), <span class="occ">music publisher</span>, was born on 5 May 1657 and baptized at the Temple Church on 14 May, the only surviving son of John Playford (1622/3&#150;1686/7), and his wife, Hannah (<i>c</i>.1633&#150;1679); his godfathers were Henry Lawes and an elder Henry Playford. He issued the first three volumes of <span class="italic">The Theatre of Music</span> (1685&#150;6) jointly with Robert Carr; this partnership did not last, and he published the fourth volume alone in 1687. From 1696 to 1703 Henry traded in the Temple Change &#145;over against St Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street&#146; but in the second edition of <span class="italic">The Divine Companion</span> (1707) he advertised books and prints for sale from a room &#145;up one pair of Stairs next the Queen's-Head Tavern over against the Middle Temple Gate&#146;.<br>
<br>Unlike his father, Henry Playford faced considerable competition from other publishers, especially those who sold cheap engraved copies of popular songs. Two sale catalogues of 1690 and 1697 show him attempting to clear old and unwanted stock, and he seems to have tried to raise the standard of published music in terms of both content and presentation, bringing out finely presented volumes, including Henry Purcell's <span class="italic">Orpheus Britannicus</span> (book 1, 1698; book 2, 1702) and John Blow's <span class="italic">Amphion Anglicus</span> (1700). The death of John Playford the printer in 1685, and the failure of John's sister Eleanor to gain permission to operate the Little Britain shop in her own right, meant that Henry did not have the option of continuing his father's printing arrangements. Although he issued more engraved editions than his father, most of his publications still used movable type: between 1688 and 1695 his main printer was Edward Jones, who produced the first and second books of <span class="italic">Harmonia sacra</span> (1688 and 1693) using a Granjon typeface, but from 1695 to 1698 he placed prestigious work such as <span class="italic">Orpheus Britannicus</span>, book 1, with John Heptinstall, to be printed in his &#145;new tied note&#146;, a round-note typeface in which quavers and semiquavers were beamed together as they would be in manuscript or engraved music. From 1699 major works were printed by William Pearson, who owned another modern typeface, the &#145;new London character&#146;, in which Playford himself had invested.<br>
<br>Throughout his independent career Playford published non-musical works and was involved in the sale of prints and paintings. From 1698 he adopted various original means of encouraging business: in the <span class="italic">Post Boy</span> of 10 September 1698 he advertised a lottery of music books, later deferred because of lack of support, and in the autumn of 1700 the same newspaper gave details of musical societies to be organized in London taverns, an initiative probably related to the publication of the first book of <span class="italic">Wit and Mirth, or, Pills to Purge Melancholy</span> in 1699. He announced a plan for music clubs in London and other cities in <span class="italic">The Second Book of the Pleasant Musical Companion</span> (1701). Between 1699 and 1702 he issued <span class="italic">Mercurius Musicus, or, The Monthly Collection of New Teaching Songs</span>, the first English periodical devoted exclusively to music; from 1704 to early 1706 he was connected with the <span class="italic">Diverting Post</span>. By 1703 he was in serious financial difficulty: on 4 June he wrote to one Mr Lewis, whom he addressed as &#145;Cosen&#146;, asking for the loan of &pound;10  (Royal College of Music, MS 2214), and on 21 July he approached him again requesting immediate payment of &pound;5 outstanding for a picture, claiming that a man to whom he owed &pound;10 had &#145;maid a vowe if I Don't pay him this afternoon he will give me Truble to Morrow&#146;  (Royal College of Music, MS 2215). On 25 November he filed a chancery suit against Pearson  (TNA: PRO, C.10 445/32); the case appears to have been amicably settled out of court, but Pearson's answer shows that Playford in fact owed him &pound;55 9<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>On or about 19 December 1688 Henry Playford married Ann (1673&#150;1743), daughter of Thomas Baker, city solicitor of Oxford from 1679 until his death in 1700; a daughter, Ann, was born in 1694 and married Thomas Fitzgerald at St Margaret's, Westminster, in 1728. Identification of Henry Playford's surprisingly young bride is confirmed by a reference to her sister Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1676) in his will, and Playford refers to his apprentice John Baker of Oxford, bound to him on 2 March 1702, as his brother  (Royal College of Music, MS 2215). The St Clement Danes rate books and the dividend books for the English stock suggest that Henry Playford died between May and 24 December 1709, but his will was not proved until 1721. His widow, who moved to a house in Little Dean's Yard, Westminster, died on 29 June 1743 and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey on 6 July. In her will she left over &pound;2500.<br>
