<span class="headword">Barker,  William George <span class="st"> [Will]</span></span>  (1868&#150;1951), <span class="occ">film producer</span>, was born at Prospect House, Waltham Lane, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 18 January 1868, the son of William Emmanuel Barker (1843/4&#150;1884), office clerk and tea merchant, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Theobald (<i>b</i>. 1845). Little is known of his early life, but he spent many years as a travelling salesman for a German company selling gold paint. His occupation was given as commercial traveller when he married, at Stoke Newington on 7 July 1897, Mary Alice (<i>b</i>. 1866/7), a milliner, daughter of George Edwards. They had at least two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic amateur photographer, Barker was able in 1896 to buy, for &pound;40, a motion picture camera from the pioneering Lumi&egrave;re brothers, using it for amateur displays of &#145;films&#146; he had shot, directed, and produced. His first professional work was on early newsreels, or &#145;topicals&#146; as they were called, and he had some success as the cameraman on one of these devoted to celebrating Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, foreshadowing the patriotic themes he would later embrace.<br>
<br>The dates of Barker's early professional activities are sometimes hard to pin down but he did found the Autoscope Company, based at 50 Gray's Inn Road, London, on 1 January 1901 and built a primitive outdoor stage at Stamford Hill in north London. &#145;Most of his pictures were, however, topicals, that is newsreels and documentaries, on which he built his reputation&#146;  (Ball, 77). In 1902 he bought two houses facing Ealing Green, West Lodge and The Lodge, the former of which was set in nearly four acres. When Autoscope merged with the Warwick Trading Company (founded by the American Charles Urban in 1898) Barker was appointed managing director and made it a real force in early British cinema, still specializing in news films, including the short-lived daily newsreel <span class="italic">London Day by Day</span> in July 1906. However, in 1907 he built the first of his three enclosed greenhouse-like glass stages at Ealing, thus making the shooting of films less dependent on the vagaries of English weather.<br>
<br>Barker's aspirations were not to be satisfied for long with news films. He sought to realize his ambitions in films more noted for their extravagance than for their artistry or subtlety. In 1909 he left Warwick to form his own company, Barker Motion Photography Ltd, and established offices in Soho Square in March 1910, making some very lavish films at Ealing, which some claimed set a new standard for British film-making. There is some dispute about where and exactly when his film of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, the first British film of the play, was made, but it is listed in 1912 by the Globe Film Co. Ltd as &#145;Barker's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>&#146;  (Ball, 318) and Gifford's <span class="italic">British Film Catalogue</span> lists its release as March 1912, though it may have been made two years earlier. Whatever the disputes about dates, and whether or not he made <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> for his own company, there can be no question that Barker was, along with Cecil Hepworth, one of the two most influential figures in British film in the period up to and during the First World War.<br>
<br>Barker's period of greatest productivity was from 1910 to 1916, and two main strands can be discerned in his output. As if emulating the American pioneer D. W. Griffith, he produced some grandiose spectacular films, often literary adaptations, and it is for these that he is chiefly remembered. There were also crime melodramas, which, drawing perhaps on his background in &#145;topicals&#146;, were noted for the realism with which they depicted the streets and docks of London. It is the former strand that seems to have captured his imagination and to have given most scope to his patriotic urges, though such films as <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Sixty Years a Queen</span> (1913), which combined his taste for actualities with vast spectacle, a very lavish, nearly two-hour production of <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span> (1915), and <span class="italic">She</span> (1916) were less popular in &#145;industrial halls&#146; than in metropolitan picture houses. The crime-genre titles included <span class="italic">Beckwith's Gun</span> (1910), <span class="italic">The Fighting Parson</span> (1912; crime with uplift), and <span class="italic">The Great Bullion Robbery</span> (1913), blending melodrama and location work.<br>
<br>It is worth singling out <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> as an example of Barker's showmanship and business instincts. With the lavish offer of &pound;1000 he enticed the stage actor Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree to repeat his famous theatrical interpretation of Cardinal Wolsey on screen, along with such other stage luminaries as Violet Vanbrugh and Henry Ainley, and used sets designed for the production at His Majesty's Theatre. <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> is described by the film historian Rachael Low as &#145;the first really important British film&#146;  (Low, 2.95). Frustratingly it seems unlikely that it survives. Part of Barker's publicity campaign for the film was to make it hard to see: he announced that, after six weeks, all twenty prints struck would be destroyed and in fact on 13 April 1911 all copies of the film, released in February, were burnt at Ealing in a ceremony attended by the press. Barker's argument for this act of seeming artistic vandalism was to demonstrate against the practice of hiring out for exhibition films whose physical quality had deteriorated beyond their use-by date. Barker did very well out of <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, while hundreds of people were reputedly turned away from cinemas bursting at the seams with enthusiastic crowds. &#145;He claimed that his film had been so expensive to produce that no dealer or showman could afford to buy it; consequently he hired it for limited runs at very high prices&#146;  (ibid., 2.45). He may well have raised standards; he certainly raised rentals.<br>
<br>The showman in him led to the patriotic cavalcade of Victoria's reign, <span class="italic">Sixty Years a Queen</span>, directed by Bert Haldane and starring one of Barker's discoveries, Blanche Forsythe, who also starred in <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> and <span class="italic">She</span>, and to the extravagances of <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, again directed by Haldane (with F. Martin Thornton) and again starring Forsythe as Edward IV's mistress. <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span> had a huge cast, with several thousand extras, and very lavish-looking production design, as the surviving stills attest. Oakley records how &#145;Barker transported 5000 people to Devil's Dyke in Sussex for three days while he shot episodes in the Battle of Marston Moor&#146;  (Oakley, 65). He even dressed actors up as policemen to help maintain order when the local constabulary refused. Sadly the resulting film failed to justify its reckless expenditure and, after one more ambitious project, the filming of H. Rider Haggard's <span class="italic">She</span> (1916), which he co-directed with H. Lisle Locoque, he wound down his operations.<br>
<br>In a typically flamboyant gesture Barker retired from film-making on armistice day 1918, though three further films he had produced were released in 1919. In 1920 he accompanied the prince of Wales on a world tour as official cameraman, leading to individual news items in the <span class="italic">Topical Budget</span> newsreels and the feature <span class="italic">50,000 Miles with the Prince of Wales</span> (1920). He was a past president of the Cinema Veterans and remained active in it until just before his death. In February 1936 he addressed the British Kinematographic Society on his pre-1910 experiences, but until the resurgence of interest in British silent cinema in the late twentieth century Barker was almost forgotten. Latterly resident at 1 Drax Avenue, Wimbledon, he died at the premises of the Roll Film Company, Nursery Road, Wimbledon, on 6 November 1951.<br>
