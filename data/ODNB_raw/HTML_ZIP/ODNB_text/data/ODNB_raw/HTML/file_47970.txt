<span class="headword">Southwell, Sir  (Charles Archibald) Philip</span>  (1894&#150;1981), <span class="occ">petroleum geologist and industrialist</span>, was born at Oak Royce, Calverley Lane, Rodley, Calverley, Yorkshire, on 6 June 1894, the only son of Charles Edward Southwell, medical practitioner, and his wife, Clare, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beaumont. Educated at Newcastle under Lyme high school between 1904 and 1912, his academic achievements were overshadowed by his prowess at cricket, rugby, and hockey. Encouraged by his father's friend, the geologist Dr Wheelton Hind (1859&#150;1920), he enrolled at Birmingham University as one of the first students on the new petroleum technology course set up there by John Cadman (1877&#150;1941). His training was interrupted by the First World War, throughout which he served mostly in the Royal Artillery; he was awarded the MC in 1918. He then returned to Birmingham and graduated in 1920.<br>
<br>Southwell's long and fruitful career in the oil industry, often in Cadman's footsteps, began when he joined S. Pearson &amp; Son, engineering contractors. Between 1922 and 1929 he worked for the Trinidad government petroleum office. He returned briefly to marry on 17 August 1926 Mary Burnett (<i>d</i>. 1981), daughter of Thomas Scarratt of Belmont Hall, Ipstones, Staffordshire. In 1930 he accepted Cadman's offer of the post of local manager of oil fields and geology with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later British Petroleum). His subsequent experience in the Persian Gulf led Southwell to predict the existence of the great oil reserves of Kuwait. Few other geologists were optimistic, and in only one well had oil been discovered in Kuwait prior to the Second World War. Southwell was then recalled and put in charge of exploring for oil reserves in England, using imported American technologies and organizing British experiments on horizontal drilling.<br>
<br>In 1946 Southwell became managing director of the new Kuwait Oil Company, jointly owned by BP and the American company Gulf Oil. His task was to open up Kuwaiti fields with American partners who had no previous experience of conditions in the Middle East. He built up the company workforce to 15,000 men, who initially lived under canvas, and he went on to develop the oilfields with great success, in line with his earlier forecasts. Kuwaiti oil replaced much of that lost to Western nations when the Iranian government nationalized its oilfields in 1951. Southwell was an early advocate of the need for local control of production from Middle East fields, and he anticipated the eventual formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). He deplored the invasion of Suez in 1956 and campaigned behind the scenes for its early end.<br>
<br>Southwell was president of the Institute of Petroleum from 1950 to 1952, and an honorary fellow from 1959. As one of Cadman's first students, the award of the institute's Cadman memorial medal in 1954 gave him particular pleasure. He was awarded the Royal Society of Arts silver medal in 1953 for his paper on Kuwait, and he sat on the RSA council from 1958, in which year he was also knighted. He was a liveryman in the Shipwrights' Company. Southwell left BP and Kuwait Oil in 1959 having reached the age of sixty-five. Retirement was, however, far from his mind and he threw himself energetically into developing the oilfields newly discovered under the North Sea, where conditions were very different and vastly more difficult than those of the Middle East. In 1960 he became chairman of Brown and Root (UK) which laid the first pipeline from BP's West Sole field in 1966. Southwell played a pioneering role in constructing North Sea oil and gas platforms, as first chairman of Brown and Root's joint venture with George Wimpey Ltd&#151;Highland Fabricators from 1973, based at Nigg Bay&#151;and as director of the Halliburton Company in Dallas from 1973. He became president of Brown and Root (UK) in 1978 and only relinquished this and the post with Highland Fabricators on 1 January 1981.<br>
<br>Southwell attributed his good health, energy, and longevity to his early passion for water polo, another sport at which he excelled. He was active in work for charities in Britain and in the Middle East, where the Southwell Hospital at Ahmadi in Kuwait was opened in 1960. He was director-general of the St John Ambulance Brigade from 1960 to 1968, a commander of the order of the Cedar of Lebanon and bailiff grand cross of the order of St John of Jerusalem, for whose eye hospital he also raised funds. Mary Southwell, who had shared enthusiastically in his interests, died in September 1981; Southwell died at the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital, Woolwich, London, after a minor operation on 30 November 1981 and was buried at Tendring parish church in Essex on 4 December. Two sons survived him.<br>
