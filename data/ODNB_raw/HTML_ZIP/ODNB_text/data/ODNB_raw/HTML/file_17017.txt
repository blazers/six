<span class="headword">Lorimer,  Peter</span>  (1812&#150;1879), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church of England</span>, born in Edinburgh, was the eldest son of John Lorimer, builder. He was educated at the Royal High School and George Heriot's Hospital in that city, and thereafter proceeded, with a bursary, to the University of Edinburgh in 1827. In 1836 he was ordained minister of the Presbyterian church, River Terrace, London, which was then connected with the Church of Scotland. After the Disruption of 1843 he and his congregation joined the synod at Berwick in 1844. On the establishment of the English Presbyterian College, London, in 1844, he was appointed professor of theology; he became its first principal in 1878. In June 1857 the college of New Jersey conferred on him the degree of DD. From his marriage in 1840 to Hannah Fox (1817&#150;1884) of Whitehaven he had a son, John Archibald, surgeon, of Farnham, Surrey, and a daughter, Annie, the wife of James Austin, barrister. He died on 29 July 1879 at Whitehaven, Cumberland, and was buried in the Grange cemetery at Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Lorimer's Scottish presbyterian background helped shape his approach to church history and to the topics which attracted his attention. His main interest focused on the Scottish Reformation and its leading exponents. As a contribution to tercentenary celebrations of the Reformation in Scotland he published in 1860 <span class="italic">The Scottish Reformation: a Historical Sketch</span>, exploring the subject through the careers of such early reformers as Patrick Hamilton, Sir David Lindsay, Alexander Alesius, Alexander Seton, Henry Forret, George Wishart, and John Knox. He drew attention, too, to the numerous early protestant exiles who settled in England, Germany, and Denmark, and to their contribution to the Reformation on the continent. Earlier, in 1857, his study <span class="italic">Precursors of Knox</span>, covering similar ground, attached priority to the careers of Hamilton, &#145;first martyr&#146;, Alesius, &#145;first academic theologian&#146;, and Lindsay, &#145;first poet&#146; of the Scottish Reformation. In that volume Lorimer utilized fresh material by Alesius on Hamilton preserved in the library at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, and he dedicated the volume to Thomas M'Crie (1797&#150;1875), professor of church history and systematic theology in the London college of the English Presbyterian church and son of the Scottish presbyterian church historian of the same name. Lorimer's <span class="italic">John Knox and the Church of England</span> (1875), his most significant historical work, incorporated fresh source material on Knox's relations with his congregation at Berwick, his &#145;Memorial&#146; to the privy council on Edward VI's second prayer book, and contacts with English puritans uncovered among the Morrice manuscripts in Dr Williams's Library in London. Appended to that work is &#145;The life and death of Mr William Whittingham, deane of Durham&#146;, printed from Anthony Wood's manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. His encouragement of record scholarship is apparent, too, in his support, as a founding member, for the Wodrow Society, named after the Scottish historian and antiquary Robert Wodrow, and established in Edinburgh in 1841 &#145;for the publication of the works of the fathers and early writers of the Reformed Church of Scotland&#146;.<br>
<br>Lorimer's other works included <span class="italic">Healthy Religion Exemplified in the Life of &hellip; Andrew Jack of Edinburgh</span> (1852), <span class="italic">The Function of the Four Gospels Viewed in Connection with Recent Criticism</span> (1869), and <span class="italic">A Good and Faithful Servant: Memoir of the Rev Archibald Jack of South Shields</span> (1871). He also translated from German, with additional notes, G. V. Lechler's <span class="italic">John Wiclif and his English Precursors</span> (2 vols., 1878) and edited, with notes, M. Stuart's <span class="italic">Critical History of the Old Testament Canon</span> (1849). He wrote an introduction to the reprint of Thomas Cartwright's <span class="italic">Book of Discipline, or, Directory of Church Government</span> (1872).<br>
