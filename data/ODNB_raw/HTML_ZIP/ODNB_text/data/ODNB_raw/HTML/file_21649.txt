<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Payne,  Joseph</span>  (1808&#150;1876), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 2 March 1808 at Bury St Edmunds. Details of his early life are obscure but his parents, Joseph Payne and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Leader, were not wealthy. On the occasion of his own marriage in 1837 Payne's father was described as a builder. About the age of fourteen Payne came under the influence of a teacher called Freeman; he became an ardent student of the classics and English literature and determined on teaching as a career. In 1830, while teaching at a private boys' school run by John Gowring in the New Kent Road, London, he wrote a 56-page pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A compendious exposition of the principles and practice of Professor Jacotot's celebrated system of education</span>. This attracted considerable attention and he became tutor to the children of David and Elizabeth Fletcher who lived in Camberwell. The tutorial class became a school and early in 1838 Fletcher and Payne established the Denmark Hill grammar school in a substantial house reputedly built by Sir Christopher Wren for Prince George of Denmark. On 28 December 1837 Payne married Eliza Dyer (<i>d</i>. 1875), daughter of the Revd John Dyer, secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society. The ceremony took place at the parish church of St Giles, Camberwell. The Paynes lived at Grove Hill House in Camberwell, where Eliza, herself an accomplished teacher who had spent some years in Paris, continued to keep a girls' school. Two sons, John Burnell and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35424/', "Joseph Frank Payne")</script>, and a daughter, Mary Eliza, were born while the Paynes were at Denmark Hill; another son, William, was born after their move to Leatherhead.<br>
<br>In January 1845 Payne opened a new boys' school, known as the Mansion grammar school, at Leatherhead in Surrey. Unlike Denmark Hill House, which was demolished in 1873, the Mansion still stood in the 1990s, housing the Leatherhead branch of the county library. Payne's new foundation was another private establishment, attended principally by boarders, with fees of between 40 and 60 guineas per year. In the 1851 census fifty-one resident pupils were listed: their ages ranged from eight to sixteen years. The success of the school was shown by the examination performances of its pupils, particularly in the Oxford local examinations, and in 1865 Payne was invited to give evidence to the Taunton commission, as was the then headmaster of the Denmark Hill School, Charles Mason. Payne's evidence indicates that the curriculum at the Mansion grammar school was wide-ranging: for example, there was a laboratory and lessons were given in practical chemistry. The discipline was mild, indeed Payne dispensed with corporal punishment. While at Leatherhead the Paynes worshipped at the Congregational church, where Payne was appointed to the lay office of deacon in 1846.<br>
<br>Payne's first advertisements for his Leatherhead school advised that &#145;he advocates no exclusive system, but aims to adopt the most valuable features of all, combining with the solid instruction of the Old Grammar School a liberal infusion of sound mathematical and scientific knowledge&#146;. His continuing commitment to broad learning was shown by the curriculum plan for a middle-class school for boys aged between eight and sixteen which he produced in 1866. For the first two years pupils would study reading, spelling and writing, history and geography, French, word and object lessons, and arithmetic. For pupils aged ten to twelve, English grammar, botany, and physics would be added. Latin would be introduced at age twelve, together with German, mathematics, English literature, and physics. Chemistry would be added in the final two years.<br>
<br>In 1863, after some nineteen years of strenuous devotion to the school, Payne retired from Leatherhead and lived at 4 Kildare Gardens, Bayswater, London. His later years were spent in a flurry of activities. In 1868 his reputation as a writer of textbooks was enhanced by the publication of <span class="italic">Studies in English Prose</span>, and there were further editions of <span class="italic">Studies in English Poetry</span> (1845) and of his best-known work, <span class="italic">Select Poetry for Children</span> (1839). This collection of poems for children aged between six and twelve, and intended for both &#145;schools and families&#146;, received its final revision and enlargement in the eighteenth edition of 1874. Payne's standing as a scholar was confirmed by work in the field of philology, and he was chairman of the council of the Philological Society in 1873&#150;4.<br>
<br>Payne was a fierce critic of many elements of English society and of education. His criticisms of boys' public schools centred upon their custom and corruption, their inefficient teaching and limited curricula, and received powerful expression in an article on Eton published in the <span class="italic">British Quarterly Review</span> in 1868. His attack on elementary schooling centred upon the ethos engendered by the revised code of 1862 which, he believed, cast a blight upon all who came under its aegis: children, teachers, and inspectors. In 1872, in two papers delivered to meetings of the Social Science Association, Payne deplored the low standards of pupil attainment, and attributed these to a system which was &#145;mechanical in conception, mechanical in means, mechanical in results&#146;.<br>
<br>But, though a critic, Payne was essentially a reformer with a firm belief in the power of education to transform individual lives and society. His campaign to improve the quality and status of the teaching profession began in 1846 as a founder member of the College of Preceptors. In the following year he became an examiner for the college's teachers' examinations in the theory and practice of education. He was vice-president of the college between 1862 and 1868, and also served at this time as vice-president of the Scholastic Registration Association. In December 1872 the council of the College of Preceptors invited Payne to become its first professor of the science and art of education. An inaugural lecture was given on 30 January 1873 and during that year Payne delivered three courses: ten lectures on the science of education, twelve on the art of education, and ten on the history of education. Of the seventy students who attended the first course, sixty-four were women. A second series of lectures was given in 1874, and a third in 1875.<br>
<br>Payne believed that the principles of a science of education were still scattered across many fields of knowledge&#151;ethics, history, logic, philosophy, physiology, psychology. One of his major aims, therefore, was to bring these into a more coherent whole. Much of his inspiration in this work came from his own experiences as an autodidact and from his observation of the natural learning processes of young children. Accordingly he argued that educators should not only be proficient in the subjects they had to teach, but should also be well informed about their pupils, and about pupils in general. They should understand the basic principles of learning and teaching. The art of the teacher was to make formal schooling a progression and refinement of natural education, and to equip learners with the desire and ability ultimately to teach themselves. Historical study was important for the good (and bad) examples it provided of the science and art of education of former times.<br>
<br>A second element in Payne's reforming zeal was his commitment to the development of educational opportunities for girls and women. He argued that &#145;The mind has properly no sex &hellip; and consequently there must be a similarity of instruction of both sexes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, 1865</span>, 1866, 362). He was a friend and collaborator of such pioneers as Beata Doreck and Frances Buss, both of whom became members of the council of the College of Preceptors. From 1872 Payne served as chairman of the Women's Education Union, and he was also one of the original shareholders of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94164', "Girls' Public Day School Company")</script> and chaired its council in 1872. Other offices held by Payne in the 1870s included membership of the council of the Social Science Association, and of the committees of the Kindergarten Association and of the Froebel Society. In 1875 he chaired the foundation meeting of the Society for the Development of the Science of Education. His interest in kindergarten methods led him to Germany, and a report on his tour of German schools in the autumn of 1874 was published posthumously in 1876.<br>
<br>Payne was described by his contemporary and colleague, W. B. Hodgson, as &#145;a dark-looking, broad-browed man, of short stature&#146; who spoke &#145;with unusual clearness, force and accuracy of expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Women's Education Union</span>, 4, 1876, 86). On 12 October 1875 Eliza Payne died of enteric fever and Payne, himself unwell, found it necessary to give up his lecture course. In December 1875 he resigned the professorship. On 30 April 1876 he died at 4 Kildare Gardens, Bayswater, of Bright's disease of the kidneys. The death certificate was signed by Joseph Frank Payne, who was to become one of the most famous medical men of his day. In his will Payne bequeathed &pound;200 to the College of Preceptors for the endowment fund for a professor of education, and &pound;50 to Thomas John Barnardo or the treasurer of the East End Juvenile Mission. A codicil gave Herbert Quick first choice of fifty books from his library, while others of his educational books were left to the College of Preceptors. The remainder of his estate was divided equally between his two surviving sons, Joseph Frank and William. The former produced two edited collections of his father's lectures and writings: the first, <span class="italic">Lectures on the Science and Art of Education</span>, was published in 1880; the second, <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of Education</span>, in 1892. Payne had been a great admirer of the society and education of the United States and several editions of the first of these volumes were produced there.<br>
