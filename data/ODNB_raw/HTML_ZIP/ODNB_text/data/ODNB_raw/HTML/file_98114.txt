<span class="headword">Jeudwine, Sir  Hugh Sandham</span>  (1862&#150;1942), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Chicheley, Buckinghamshire, on 9 June 1862, the son of William Jeudwine (1812/13&#150;1888), vicar of Chicheley, and his wife, Grace Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sandham (1822/3&#150;1904), widow of George Canning Backhouse. Educated at Eton College (1876&#150;80) and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1880&#150;82), he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery on 22 February 1882 and was rapidly promoted lieutenant (22 May 1882). He served for ten years as a regimental officer, showing a great capacity for work and making himself proficient in the scientific side of his arm of the service. He was promoted captain on 1 September 1891, and on 10 February 1891 he married Mary Grace, daughter of Edward David Meynell, gentleman. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>In January 1891 Jeudwine went through the long course at the School of Gunnery and, instead of applying for the Staff College, Camberley, a normal step on the promotion ladder, he became an instructor at the School of Gunnery, Shoeburyness, which post he held from 1894 to late 1899. Just as he left Shoeburyness war broke out in South Africa and he was posted out as a special service officer in December 1899. He was a staff officer in Cape Colony, promoted major on 3 January 1900, and was made a district commandant, fighting a number of actions south of the Orange River. He served the full two and a half years of the war, including some time as a column commander pursuing Boer rebels in Cape Colony. In carrying out this task he gained a reputation for his uncompromising methods, and acquired the nickname the Boer Crusher. Allegedly some of his colleagues began to avoid his company. He was awarded the queen's South Africa medal with two clasps, and the king's medal with two clasps.<br>
<br>Jeudwine remained on the staff in South Africa until May 1904, serving as deputy assistant adjutant-general and deputy assistant quartermaster-general during the settlement of the country. He was briefly an assistant superintendent of experiments at the School of Gunnery. From October 1904 to late 1908 he worked at the War Office, in the military training branch, as the resident expert on artillery matters; in 1897, 1907, and 1908 he was a gold medal essayist for the Royal Artillery Institution. On 4 July 1908 he was made lieutenant-colonel and, as often happened, was briefly on half-pay thereafter. From April 1909 he served as deputy assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot command, and in January 1912 became an instructor and general staff officer, grade 2 (GSO2) at the Staff College, Camberley. He was a sound and serious teacher under Major-General Sir William Robertson, and was made colonel on 4 March 1912.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War Jeudwine was general staff officer, grade 1 (GSO1) at the Staff College. He was posted immediately as GSO1 to Sir Douglas Haig's 1st corps and went to France and Flanders with it. He served through the retreat from Mons, and at the battles of the Marne and the Aisne. He made some vital personal interventions during the critical fighting at Ypres. On 1 November 1914 he was posted as GSO1 to the 1st division. In January 1915 he was made brigadier-general, general staff, to the newly formed 5th corps. He was an unforgiving, and apparently unpopular, chief of staff under its second and equally unforgiving commander, Edmund Allenby. The corps fought at the second battle of Ypres and in several subsidiary actions in the Ypres salient thereafter. In September 1915 he commanded the 41st infantry brigade of the 14th (light) division.<br>
<br>On 3 January 1916 Jeudwine got his division&#151;the 55th (West Lancashire) division, Territorial Force, as it was being reconstituted in France&#151;and was confirmed as a major-general in June 1916. He commanded this excellent fighting division for the rest of the war. They fought at Guillemont and Delville Wood on the Somme in 1916, and at Pilckem ridge, the Menin Road ridge, and Cambrai in 1917. Perhaps their finest hour was the defence of Givenchy on 9 April 1918, when they defeated the German attacks that had already swept away the adjoining Portuguese corps. Jeudwine's calm presence of mind saw the gaping hole in the British lines sealed on its southern edge, and not one inch of ground was conceded to the enemy. In a dispatch Haig praised his role in saving the channel ports. As part of the Fifth Army Jeudwine then led his division in the final advance to victory from August to November 1918.<br>
<br>After the armistice (11 November 1918) the 55th division marched to Cologne and, in March 1919, became the Lancashire division of the British army of the Rhine&#151;a signal honour. Jeudwine served as chief of staff at Cologne from August to October 1919, and then returned home on being specially selected to command the 5th division, then stationed at the Curragh, Kildare, Ireland. After the sharp upturn in violence in November 1920 the government planned a limited introduction of martial law. Jeudwine, who in the absence on leave of Sir Nevil Macready served as commander-in-chief, Ireland, canvassed the generals in Ireland and stated firmly that the army advised its application to the entire country. The proclamation of martial law, signed on 10 December, applied to just four counties (later eight), a limitation that undermined its objective, especially in containing the flow of arms. The soldiers' view was borne out when it was abandoned within six months. Jeudwine remained in Ireland until July 1922 and wrote the official <span class="italic">Record of the Rebellion in Ireland in 1920&#150;21 and the Part Played by the Army in Dealing with it</span> (1922).<br>
<br>After another short spell on half-pay Jeudwine was made lieutenant-general in January 1923, and in October 1923 became director-general of the Territorial Army, a post to which he was particularly well suited after his wartime experiences with the Lancashire territorials. In October 1927 he retired from the army after forty-seven years of service. He was created CB in 1915, KCB in 1918, and KBE in 1922. Judy, as he was known in the army, took his profession seriously, and wrote for the military journals. In 1928&#150;9 he lectured to the Staff College on the fighting at Givenchy in 1918. He died at his home, Glencairn, Camberley, Surrey, on 2 December 1942.<br>
