<span class="headword">Nicol,  George</span>  (1740?&#150;1828), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was probably born in May 1740 in Scotland. Little is known of his family and early life. By 1769 he was living in London, where he was employed as an assistant and subsequently as a partner to his uncle David Wilson, a bookseller on the Strand: their joint names appear in the imprint to Stephen Hales's <span class="italic">Statical Essays</span> (first published 1733) and Robert Wallace Johnson's <span class="italic">New System of Midwifery</span> (1769). On his uncle's death, Nicol inherited a share in <span class="italic">The Gazetteer</span>, in which he took a close interest.<br>
<br>In 1773, at James West's sale, Nicol purchased the majority of the Caxtonian volumes for George III, an act which upset rival booksellers, such as John Almon, but might have helped Nicol gain the position of bookseller to the king in 1781 (which he held until relinquishing it in 1820). Four years later (on the request of George III and under the guidance of Sir Joseph Banks) Nicol was responsible for republishing a second, superior edition of Captain James Cook's account of his third and last voyage (3 vols., 1785). Nicol also became involved with John Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery and its attendant publications, and probably initiated plans to publish Boydell's edition of Shakespeare from his own press at his home in Pall Mall. Although the task was eventually carried out by William Bulmer, Nicol remained involved in the project with responsibility for supervision of the letterpress. Together with Bulmer, Boydell, and the typefounder William Martin, Nicol wished to create a type that combined utility with beauty to rival continental designs. Their aim was achieved with a typeface&#151;later named the &#145;Bodoni Hum&#146;&#151;produced in a hoax experiment by the Shakespeare printing office, which experts took to be the work of the continental master Bodoni. The output from this printing office contributed largely to the growing reputation and popularity enjoyed by British produced books at the turn of the century.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Nicol gained a reputation for arranging and cataloguing the libraries of members of the aristocracy. In 1812 he organized the sale of books owned by the late third duke of Roxburghe, for which he wrote the catalogue and oversaw a highly successful auction, prompting what Thomas Frognall Dibdin termed &#145;bibliomania&#146; and the establishment of the Roxburgh Club: the collection, assembled by Nicol for &pound;5000, sold for &pound;23,341 during the forty-two-day sale.<br>
<br>On 8 September 1787 Nicol married Mary Boydell at St Olave Jewry in the City of London. <a name="cosubject_40487"></a><span class="headword">Mary Nicol</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1747, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">print collector and writer</span>, was Nicol's second wife; no detail is known of his first marriage, from which he had a son, William. Mary Boydell, one of the nine children of Samuel Boydell (1727&#150;1783), farmer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (1725&#150;1764), was born at Broad Lane, Hawarden, Flintshire, and was baptized on 10 December 1747 at Hawarden. Her younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3121/', "Josiah Boydell")</script> later achieved fame as an artist and publisher. Prior to her marriage she travelled on the continent with her uncle, the publisher and owner of the Shakspeare Gallery, John Boydell. Her manuscript memoirs of the tour were illustrated by a collection of drawings. A noted beauty with &#145;a countenance [which] beamed with the benevolence which formed the distinguishing feature of her character&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1824), she attracted many admirers, including the miniature and portrait painter Ozias Humphry. In 1786 she survived an attempt on her life by shooting, near Leicester Square, London. From 1790 to 1791 she acted as lady mayoress of London when her uncle served as lord mayor. Mary died at Pall Mall on 21 December 1820 and was buried in St Olave Jewry. Following her death her collection of prints was sold, with the duke of Buckingham the principal purchaser.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life George Nicol described himself, though poor, as having credit &#145;without end&#146;, owed in part by his confidante and friend Lady Essex Ker, sister of the duke of Roxburghe, from whose estate Nicol and later his son attempted to regain their moneys after her death. Courteous and tactful in business, Nicol was said to be &#145;not a bookseller but a gentleman dealing in books&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 98/2, 279). He retired from business in 1825 and died at his house in Pall Mall, London, on 25 June 1828, after a long illness. He too was buried at St Olave Jewry.<br>
