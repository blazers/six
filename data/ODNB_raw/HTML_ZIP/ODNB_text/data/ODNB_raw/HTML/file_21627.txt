<span class="headword">Paull,  James</span>  (1770&#150;1808), <span class="occ">trader and politician</span>, was the son of Alexander Paul, a tailor in Perth, and his wife, Elizabeth Adam. He was educated at the University of St Andrews and then briefly trained for the law with a writer to the signet in Edinburgh before leaving, at the age of eighteen, for India to seek his fortune. By 1790 he had established himself in Lucknow as a private trader, a role in which he prospered. In 1801 he returned to England with a fortune but spectacular losses at the gaming table forced him to return to India in 1802 in order to rebuild his finances. Initially he had received the assistance of the governor-general, Marquess Wellesley, in resuming his residence in Lucknow in the face of the objections of the nawab of Oudh but Wellesley soon changed his policy and sought to have all the private traders dispersed. This change of mind by Wellesley instilled a deep-seated sense of grievance in Paull who would, after once more returning to England in 1805, spend the next phase of his life pursuing a vendetta against Wellesley.<br>
<br>In May 1805 Paull purchased a seat in parliament for Newtown, Isle of Wight, largely out of a desire to further his campaign against Wellesley, and his first significant act upon being returned was to move for papers relating to Wellesley's conduct in India. From the outset Paull seems to have seen his campaign as a rerun of the impeachment of Warren Hastings in the 1780s with himself cast in the role of an avenging Burke and Wellesley as the hapless Hastings. It was an unrealistic hope. Paull was no Burke and the hopes he had of support from his contacts among the whigs and the supporters of the prince of Wales were to be disappointed. The whigs and Carlton House had initially appeared to be sympathetic to Paull's campaign against Wellesley, seeing it as a useful stick with which to beat the Pitt ministry. In some respects Paull's campaign does seem to have caused Wellesley some political and personal discomfort. Wellesley referred to &#145;the miserable attack of this obscure and low man&#146; and to Paull as his &#145;assassin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 7.337; 8.204), and expended some &pound;30,000 on his defence but William Pitt's death in January 1806 and the formation of the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;, combining Grenvillites, whigs, and supporters of the prince of Wales in a coalition ministry, robbed Paull's attack of any chance of ultimate success, despite the fact that it dragged on in parliament until 1808. The new first lord of the Treasury, Lord Grenville, was a close friend of Wellesley and this, together with the fact that the political benefits to be had from pursuing Wellesley were diminished given that the whigs were now in government, led them to pull back from their support for Paull's campaign. This betrayal, as Paull saw it, would help to push him towards alliance with radical politicians such as Sir Francis Burdett, John Horne Tooke, William Cobbett, and Major John Cartwright, who themselves had come, for various reasons, to be disappointed in the whigs.<br>
<br>It was through his friendship with William Windham that Paull had first met Cobbett in 1805 and it was through Cobbett that Paull would be introduced to such luminaries as Burdett and Horne Tooke, becoming a regular figure at the dinners Horne Tooke held at his home in Wimbledon, at which many of the leading lights of London radicalism regularly gathered. It was his involvement with these radical politicians and in particular his role in the politics of the constituency of Westminster which were to provide the most significant episodes in Paull's public life. The constituency of Westminster was something of a peculiarity in the unreformed electoral system owing to its electorate, which was both large (about 12,000) and socially diverse, encompassing the metropolitan &eacute;lite as well as the tradesmen, artisans, and shopkeepers who formed the most numerous social grouping among the electorate. The death of the foreign secretary, Charles James Fox, in September 1806, who had been one of the constituency's two MPs since 1780, opened up the possibility for the independents and radicals in Westminster to exploit the peculiarities of the constituency and to try to break the aristocratic hold over the representation of Westminster. Paull was to be a central figure in this attempt.<br>
<br>At the by-election which followed Fox's death the ministry put forward Lord Percy, the son of the duke of Northumberland, as its candidate. Initially it looked as though Richard Brinsley Sheridan might also stand, but the embarrassment of two government candidates for one seat was avoided by Sheridan's withdrawal. Paull was a leading figure in the attempt by certain of the radicals to find a candidate to oppose Percy, angered by what they regarded as a typical aristocratic &#145;job&#146;. This attempt failed and Percy was returned unopposed in October 1806 but his success was short-lived as the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;, desirous of shoring up its parliamentary position in the wake of Fox's death, dissolved parliament in late October 1806 and called a general election. In this election the radicals would mount a much more effective challenge at Westminster in the person of Paull himself.<br>
<br>Paull's opponents at Westminster in the general election of 1806 were Sheridan for the whigs and Sir Samuel Hood for the tories. Of the two it was Sheridan who had the most to fear from a challenge by Paull and it was from him and his supporters that the most sustained campaign against Paull came. In particular Sheridan, somewhat hypocritically given his own background, chose to focus on Paull's humble social origins as the son of a tailor: &#145;a stage from Drury Lane was brought to the hustings at Covent Garden with four tailors at work, a live goose (symbol of the tailor), and several cabbages (symbol of the tailor's meagre diet)&#146;  (Spater, 1.181). Also, a large pole with a cabbage and a smoothing iron on it and a man dressed as an ape carrying all the tools of a tailor were paraded in the constituency. This kind of vilification was repeated in some of Gillray's cartoons of the campaign, with Burdett portrayed as a goose and Paull being shown holding a giant pair of tailor's shears. Nevertheless Paull, standing as an opponent of &#145;oppression and corruption&#146;  (Fisher, 2.270), did well in the early days of the poll and Sheridan was able to pull ahead of him into second place only by coalescing with Hood. In the end, after fifteen days of polling Paull was beaten into third place, but by less than 300 votes: Hood polled 5478 votes, Sheridan 4758, and Paull 4481. Paull's narrow defeat by a whig&#150;tory coalition was interpreted by his supporters as a moral victory for Paull but attempts to turn this moral victory into an actual one by petitioning against Sheridan's return were cut short by the dissolution of April 1807 which signalled another general election hard on the heels of the one of November 1806. Paull, given his showing in 1806, should have been in a strong position to take the seat but by early 1807 his relations with the other leading radicals had deteriorated. In truth, Paull's relations with the other radicals had never been easy or without their tensions: even before the 1806 election Cobbett, while approving of Paull's &#145;activity and zeal&#146;, had worried that he was &#145;too fond of the Bond Street set&#151;has too great a desire to live amongst the great, to aim at the only objects that can save the throne and the liberties of the people&#146;  (Smith, 2.15&#150;16).<br>
<br>The crucial breach in Paull's relations with the other radicals occurred when Paull tried, through a series of newspaper advertisements, to manoeuvre Burdett into standing as a joint candidate with himself at Westminster, possibly motivated by a belief that Burdett would pay his electoral expenses. The intricacies of the quarrel that ensued may never be fully known but Sir Francis Burdett, via a letter read out to a meeting of radicals held at the Crown and Anchor on 1 May 1807 by his brother, Jones Burdett, repudiated Paull's actions. Feeling himself ill-served by Burdett's behaviour Paull demanded satisfaction. Paull was known for his temper and had already fought a duel while in India which had left him unable to use his right arm fully. The duel with Burdett occurred on 2 May 1807 at Coombe Wood, Kingston, and on the second shot, which took place at Paull's insistence after the first shots missed, Burdett was hit in the thigh and Paull in the legbone. According to Francis Place, the leading figure on the radical electoral committee, many of Paull's supporters, in the light of his recent behaviour, had decided to abandon him even before the duel, but the duel certainly completed this process of alienation. At a meeting of radicals on 4 May 1807 at the Crown and Anchor pro-Burdett speakers were shouted down by the remaining Paull supporters but the Burdettites simply retired to another room and under Place formed a committee to return Burdett. Paull himself vacillated: two days before the poll at Westminster he withdrew but eventually allowed himself to be nominated only to withdraw again before the end of polling, in which he finished a distant last with only 269 votes, while Burdett, without any active participation on his part, topped the poll with 5134 votes, thanks to the activities of Place's Westminster committee. This crushing blow, brought on in part by his own impatience and scheming, was to mark the end of Paull's political career. The following year, after another large loss at the gaming tables and racked by pain from his various duelling wounds, Paull committed suicide on 15 April by cutting his own throat at his house, 2 Charles Street, Westminster. According to a contemporary obituary, Paull had recently been given to requesting that &#145;when he died, which would be soon, he trusted that his body would be conveyed back to the East Indies and blown up&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 78, 1.373). This last wish was not granted and James Paull, who despite his faults was a key figure in opening up the Westminster constituency, was interred on 21 April 1808 at St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
