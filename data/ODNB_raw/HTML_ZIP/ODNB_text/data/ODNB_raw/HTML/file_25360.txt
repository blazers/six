<span class="headword">Sherer,  Moyle</span>  (1789&#150;1869), <span class="occ">army officer and writer</span>, youngest son of Joseph Sherer of Southampton, was born in that city on 18 February 1789. He was descended from the Moyles of Bake in Cornwall. From 1801&#150;7 he attended Winchester College, but left on obtaining a commission in the 34th regiment of foot. In 1809 his corps was ordered to Portugal, and took part in the engagements of Albuera, Arroyo dos Molinos, and Vitoria. In the summer of 1813 Sherer was taken prisoner at the pass of Maya, and was moved to France, where he remained for two years, living chiefly at Bayonne.<br>
<br>In 1818 the 34th went out to Madras, from where Sherer sent home the manuscript of <span class="italic">Sketches of India</span> (1821), which went through four editions. Encouraged by its success, Sherer produced several more books after his return to England in 1823. <span class="italic">Recollections of the Peninsula</span> (1823) reached five editions and led Sherer into correspondence with Sir William Napier over Sir John Moore's campaign. This was followed by two travel books, <span class="italic">Scenes and Impressions in Egypt and Italy</span> (1824), and <span class="italic">A Ramble in Germany</span> (1826). While in India, Sherer had imbibed evangelical religious views, and, anxious to promote them among his comrades in the army, published in 1827 a treatise named <span class="italic">Religio militis</span>. He also wrote works of fiction and biography. Some, such as his <span class="italic">Life of Wellington</span> (1830&#150;32), proved popular; others, such as <span class="italic">The Broken Font</span> (1837), did not. Perhaps because Sherer's works were published without his name, he has been variously (and apparently erroneously) referred to as Joseph Moyle and Joseph Moyle Sherer.<br>
<br>A keen soldier, Sherer was promoted to a brevet majority in 1830 and became captain in the 96th regiment in 1831, before being placed on half pay in 1832. He had little taste for garrison life, and retired from the army about 1836, to Claverton Farm, near Bath. He remained for many years in the same neighbourhood, but he became mentally ill and had to move from his home at Combe Hay, Somerset, to Brislington House, near Bristol. He died there on 15 November 1869, and was buried in Brislington churchyard.<br>
