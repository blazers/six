<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  Andrew Hunter Arbuthnot</span>  (1903&#150;1977), <span class="occ">politician and businessman</span>, was born on 19 December 1903 in Edinburgh, the city with which he was associated throughout his life. His parents were Alfred Alexander Arbuthnot Murray, writer to the signet and fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moir. He was educated in Edinburgh at Daniel Stewart's College and George Heriot's School, where he was sports champion in 1922. He then entered business as an insurance broker.<br>
<br>Murray was elected to Edinburgh town council for the North Leith ward in 1928. He served on the council until 1951, being latterly elected for the Liberton ward, albeit with one year's absence in 1934. Leith suffered as much as any other industrial town from the depression of the 1930s and Murray's record of social work was a distinguishing feature of his career. He quickly rose to prominence on the council, serving as the city's honorary treasurer between 1943 and 1946 and as lord provost from 1947 to 1951.<br>
<br>Murray was widely respected as lord provost, being described by contemporaries as a &#145;tireless and devoted personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 22 March 1977, 4). He exercised a central influence over the post-war redevelopment of the city of Edinburgh. Slum properties in the Old Town were cleared, and replaced by estates in the suburbs, while the Old Town's historical character was preserved. He also championed the city's artistic scene. Having, during the Second World War, revived the Leith pageant, he was instrumental in the foundation of the Edinburgh festival in 1947. He argued that the festival could engender a &#145;better spirit of understanding between men and women, through an appreciation of the arts&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Aug 1948, 4f) and towards that end he travelled to Belgrade to bring the Yugoslav National Ballet to Edinburgh. He was awarded the freedom of the city of Athens in 1950, in recognition of his efforts to promote the city of Edinburgh abroad. As lord provost he received a knighthood in 1949 and an honorary doctorate in laws from Edinburgh University in 1950. After his period of office ended he was commissioned, in 1953, as a deputy lieutenant of the county of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Known as a supporter of the National Liberal Party, Murray was adopted as Unionist candidate for the marginal Labour seat of Central Edinburgh following the 1950 general election, but resigned before the 1951 election took place. He was adopted by Leith Liberal Association in 1954 to contest the town's parliamentary seat as an independent but finished a distant third to the Labour MP, James Hoy, in the 1955 election. Seeing no future for the National Liberal cause, he persuaded the Leith Liberals to rejoin the Scottish Liberal Party, of which he became a vice-president in 1957. He fought Leith as a Liberal candidate in 1959, but saw his vote drop and he again finished third. It was to be his last parliamentary contest. Murray was elected president of the Liberal Party in 1960, serving for twelve months, and was a treasurer of the party for three years from 1962. He was not universally popular within the party, given his previous connections with the National Liberals; nevertheless, the Liberals benefited from association with such a senior figure in lowland Scottish politics as well as from his assistance during a period of considerable financial strain.<br>
<br>Murray was as prominent in Scottish business as in politics, sitting on the boards of the stores group Hide &amp; Co. and the Scottish Motor Traction Company. He was also, briefly, chairman of the Equitable Industrial Company of Scotland. His involvement with the latter two firms ended with litigation in which he played a prominent part in the defence of small shareholders' rights in the face of hostile takeover bids.<br>
<br>Murray was appointed OBE in 1945 for his involvement with the fire service before and during the Second World War. He was elected commandant of the Edinburgh Auxiliary Fire Service in 1938 and was responsible for its being one of the few to be close to its full authorized strength on the outbreak of the conflict. He was made fire inspector of the headquarters of the fire brigades division of the Scottish home department in 1942. He was closely allied with the order of St John of Jerusalem throughout his life, becoming a companion of the order in 1949, a knight of the order five years later, and a chancellor of the order in 1963. At his death he was preceptor of the ancient Knights Templar institution at Torphichen, West Lothian, and held the title of chancellor of the priory of Scotland.<br>
<br>In his later years Murray remained committed to several of the causes he had first espoused in his youth. He was a governor of George Heriot's School and chaired the governors of Carberry Tower, a Church of Scotland youth centre opened in 1962. He died on 21 March 1977, at his home, 1 Randolph Place, in the New Town of Edinburgh. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (22 March 1977) recalled the occasion when, as captain of the orange colours, an archaic council post which entitled the holder to the use of a white stallion in an official capacity, Murray had acquired such an animal and ridden it through Edinburgh. A subsequent lord provost, Sir Herbert Brechin, summed him up as &#145;a great figure&#146; who &#145;commanded attention wherever he went&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening News</span>, 22 March 1977, 9). He was unmarried.<br>
