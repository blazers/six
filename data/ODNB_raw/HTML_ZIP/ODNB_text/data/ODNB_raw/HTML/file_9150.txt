<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fanshawe,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1533&#150;1601), <span class="occ">exchequer official</span>, was the eldest son of John Fanshawe, a minor landowner of Fanshaw Gate in Derbyshire; his mother was either Mary Rowland or Margaret Eyre. Tradition has him educated at Jesus College, Cambridge. It was probably early in Edward VI's reign that he went to London to be a clerk to his uncle Henry Fanshawe, at that time one of the eight sworn clerks in the king's remembrancer's office. By the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, he was trusted by Treasurer Winchester and by other principal officers with various confidential matters. Henry Fanshawe became queen's remembrancer, and Thomas, who obtained the reversion of the position in July 1568, succeeded his uncle who died on 28 October 1568. Thomas also took over Henry's lease of the house in Warwick Lane which was his private office. He was then in a position to marry, his first wife being Mary, daughter of Anthony Bourchier of Barnsley, Gloucestershire. After her death (9 June 1578), Thomas married Joan (<i>d</i>. 1622), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37985/', "Thomas &#145;Customer&#146; Smythe")</script>. They had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66613/', "Thomas Fanshawe")</script>, who became a government official. He was also invited to join the Middle Temple in 1571.<br>
<br>The office of queen's remembrancer was one of the three key administrative elements in the upper exchequer. Audit business was split between the queen's remembrancer and the lord treasurer's remembrancer in such a way that Fanshawe oversaw customs and subsidies, and had some responsibility for land and the growing exchequer equity cases. The routine work was handled by the sworn clerks; the remembrancer himself was often out and about on &#145;foreign&#146; business. He was frequently called on to give advice to the treasurer or the chancellor and under-treasurer. Whether it was he or Peter Osborne who &#145;wrote&#146; the account of Exchequer practice (eventually published as <span class="italic">The Practice of the Exchequer Court</span>) for William Cecil in 1572 is a complex issue. Both were trusted advisers and were often left to arbitrate together in such sensitive matters as the Chester customs office, a long-running dispute which they first heard in 1577.<br>
<br>Fanshawe was committed to religious reformation as embodied in the Church of England, and he was a member of the southern ecclesiastical commission for many years. His commitment to reform made him a strong advocate of education. In 1579 he fulfilled his uncle's bequest to have a school erected at Dronfield near the family home. He employed Alexander Richardson as a family tutor for his children, and left money in his will for his continued support. Fanshaw sat in nearly every parliament of Elizabeth's reign&#151;for Rye in 1571, for Arundel in 1572, 1584, 1586, and 1589, and for Much Wenlock in 1597, probably himself seeking the membership. He was regularly appointed to committees where exchequer input would be valuable, such as those dealing with a <span class="roman">Bill for Tellers and Receivers</span> (1572) and bills on land and sheriffs (1576); but he did not consider himself a placeman. In 1584, when his appointment to a committee on reducing officers' fees was challenged, he responded:<blockquote>I am come hither as a commonwealth man and not as an officer. If any man envy my gains, I would he had it. I see not why I may not be a committee [man] that am a clerk to lose by it as Mr Recorder to be [a committee man] who is shortly to be a judge and gaine by it. (Hartley, 2.118)</blockquote>Ann Fanshawe records a family tradition that Queen Elizabeth said of Thomas that &#145;he was the best officer of accounts she had and a person of great integrity&#146;. Nevertheless, he was able to raise his family to a position of considerable wealth and influence. In 1575 he purchased Ware Park near Hertford which was to be the family home for over a century. He died on 19 February 1601 at Warwick Lane and was buried in the south aisle of Ware church on 19 March. Although he had asked for no pomp, the funeral was conducted with suitable gravity and the heralds in attendance. He left Ware Park to his wife, Joan, and his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9148/', "Henry Fanshawe")</script>. Joan, apparently of unsound mind, died in 1622 and was buried at Ware Park.<br>
