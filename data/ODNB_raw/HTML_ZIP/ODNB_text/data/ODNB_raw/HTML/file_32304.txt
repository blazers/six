<span class="headword">Carpenter,  Robert Pearson</span>  (1830&#150;1901), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at 45 Mill Road, Cambridge, on 18 November 1830. Both of his brothers&#151;George (1818&#150;1849), a butcher, and William&#151;played cricket for Cambridge town. Originally a boot-closer by trade, Robert soon became a professional cricketer with engagements at Godmanchester (1854), Ipswich (1855&#150;7), Birkenhead (1858), and Marlborough College (1859&#150;60). In Cambridge he became known as the &#145;Old Gardener&#146;, because of his custodianship of Parker's Piece (until 1881). It was there he played in 1856 for the town against the university.<br>
<br>Carpenter's first match at Lord's was in June 1858, when he scored 45 for the United All England eleven against the All England eleven. Throughout the 1860s he was the leading batsman in the United All England eleven; in the matches against the All England eleven, no batsman on either side surpassed his average of 24.44. He also appeared in nearly 150 matches against &#145;odds&#146; of eighteen or twenty-two players. While loyal to the United All England eleven, as a professional he was ready to appear for the All England eleven when available and it was for this side that he made 174 against the Radcliffe-on-Trent XVIII in 1870 and 134&#151;his highest score in first-class cricket&#151;against Yorkshire in 1865. In the same decade he also played for Cambridgeshire, when his batting, together with that of Tom Hayward and the fast bowling of George Tarrant, gave the county pre-eminence for a few seasons. Against Surrey at the Oval in 1861 he made 100. He made eighteen appearances (1859&#150;73) for the Players in matches against the Gentlemen, scoring centuries in 1860 and 1861, both at the Oval. He went to America in 1859 with the first English overseas touring team, led by George Parr, and to Australia, under the same captain, in 1863&#150;4.<br>
<br>Carpenter was an attacking batsman, especially off the back foot. After he retired, in 1876, he umpired, standing in two test matches (1886, 1888). He died on 14 July 1901 at his home, 45 Mill Road, Cambridge. He left a widow, Eliza. One of their sons, Harry Carpenter (1869&#150;1933), played for Essex (1888&#150;1920).<br>
