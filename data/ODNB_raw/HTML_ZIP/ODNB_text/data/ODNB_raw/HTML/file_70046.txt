<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Black,  David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1546&#150;1603), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was probably born in Perth, the son of Henry Black (<i>d</i>. before 1594), a burgess of the city. He matriculated as a student in St Salvator's College at the University of St Andrews in 1561, when he is likely to have been aged about fifteen. Although there is no record of his graduation as MA, he must have completed the full arts course over four years, as he was always given the title Mr. On completing his studies he followed the career of a schoolmaster in England, where he lived for about seventeen years, and where he was given rights of citizenship. In the early 1580s he was living with his wife, Katherine Prattie, in the parsonage of Kilkhampton in Cornwall, as the guest of the incumbent Eusebius Paget. The patronage of the parish was in the hands of Sir Richard Grenville, who was apparently briefly converted to puritanism by Paget and Black but who later turned against them. Paget, an eloquent preacher and writer, had before his presentation to Kilkhampton in 1580 been on one occasion deprived for nonconformity. In Black he found a kindred spirit.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1584 Black appeared before Bishop Woolton of Exeter, who was acting on behalf of the high commission witnesses. The bishop gave evidence that Black had, privately in Grenville's house and publicly in the church of Kilkhampton at the time of service, expounded the scriptures without ecclesiastical authority, conducted other religious services, and made accusations against the practices of the Church of England. Black was ordered to appear before the high commission in London on 26 November 1584. From the articles then put forward against him it appears that he had criticized the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, claimed that there ought not to be bishops in the Church of England, did not pray for the queen, and did not acknowledge her as the supreme head of the church. He was said to be &#145;a common inveygher against the state ecclesiasticall of this realme and the members therof&#146;  (Ritchie, 522). In 1583 Archbishop John Whitgift had launched a campaign against puritan clergy, requiring subscription to three articles, of which the second declared &#145;That the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and of ordering bishops, priests and deacons containeth nothing in it contrary to the word of God&#146;  (Collinson, 245). It was therefore unsurprising that Black should now consider returning to Scotland.<br>
<br>At this time a number of ministers also arrived in London who had fled from Scotland, following attempts by the government there to restore episcopacy and assert royal supremacy over the church. Among them was Black's contemporary at St Andrews University, Andrew Melville, who had recently been called before the privy council for alleged treasonable statements made in sermons and had been sentenced to imprisonment for declining the council's jurisdiction in the matter. It is reasonable to assume that Black met with Melville in London, and that together they discussed the possibility of Black's returning to Scotland. It is not known how Black was treated by the high commission, but on 13 May 1587 he signed a declaration undertaking to conform to the Church of England during his residence in England, and apologized for remarks he had made about the archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1590 Black, &#145;be the cairfull procurement&#146; of Andrew Melville at the general assembly, was appointed minister of St Andrews  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 293). On 11 November of that year he was unanimously chosen by the St Andrews kirk session as their pastor and minister. His settlement in St Andrews did not run smoothly. He found at the end of his first year that the work was too demanding for one minister and he withdrew from his charge. In April 1593 the general assembly required that he return and nominated Robert Wallace as his colleague. By 19 September 1593 Black and Wallace had accepted this decision and required that pastoral responsibilities be divided equally between them. Black gave early indication of his rigorous plans for the exercise of ecclesiastical discipline by requiring in this matter from the outset the full support of the magistrates. Emphasis was placed on eradicating fornication, on enforcing strict sabbath observance, and on providing adequately for the poor. As a member of presbytery Black exhibited a similar diligence in calling upon his non-resident ministerial brethren to return to their charges and to fulfil their responsibilities. His &#145;singular fidelitie and diligence in the ministrie&#146; won for him the unstinted praise of like-minded colleagues  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 293).<br>
<br>Not unexpectedly Black's emphasis on discipline made him enemies. He had a hard struggle with both the kirk session and the town council in the early years of his ministry to gain acceptance for his programme of moral reform, and in addition he incurred the ill will of individual citizens. One of those was William Balfour, who feared eviction from a house in the abbey grounds, which had been designated as a manse for Black. According to James Melvill, Balfour was one of a group of malcontents who reported to James VI &#145;calumnious informationes&#146; against Black  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 323), who was consequently summoned before the king for alleged defamatory remarks made from the pulpit against earlier monarchs. Black declined the king's jurisdiction in the matter, and maintained that he ought to answer for what he said from the pulpit in an ecclesiastical court. After a somewhat heated discussion and a private explanation by Black to James of what he had said about the latter's mother, the matter was resolved. Subsequently Black and Balfour were reconciled.<br>
<br>This incident in no way restricted Black's moral reforming activities, nor did it end the monitoring of his pulpit pronouncements. His reputation in England as an outspoken critic of the establishment there had apparently followed him to Scotland and his pulpit pronouncements were reported to English agents. At the end of October 1596, for instance, Black was reported to have declared that the queen of England was an atheist and that the religion professed in England was but a show. By 12 November James had taken action against Black, who was summoned to appear before the king and his council. A council of ministers objected to the king's action, but James was determined that Black should answer the charges against him, which included derogatory statements made against King James, his queen, and kings in general. At a time when relations between king and church were frequently strained, James was anxious to hold ministers responsible for the political content of their sermons, to reassure Queen Elizabeth of the strength and stability of his rule, and to restrict ministers' attempts to reserve matters that were in the first instance ecclesiastical for the jurisdiction of the church's courts. This last point was set out by Black and other ministers in a written declinature submitted before he appeared in front of king and council. In the presence of the council he again declined its authority, maintaining that he was answerable to a church court for what he said in the pulpit. In taking this position he was confident of the support of the commissioners of the general assembly. King James, however, regarded Black's stance as a flagrant challenge to his right to rule. He was determined to act quickly and decisively, well aware that his action against Black was being reported to Burghley.<br>
<br>Black was publicly summoned to appear again before the council. Most of those who had submitted written evidence described him &#145;as an unquiet and restless spirited man, a sower of sedition and discord &hellip; though one added that by some of the town he was reputed good, quiet and honest&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1595&#150;7, 382). But although Black had obtained favourable testimonials from the provost and bailies of St Andrews, from the kirk session, and from the university, the king and council declared themselves competent judges, as the accusations were treasonable and seditious, and on 9 December he was convicted and ordered to go into ward, &#145;in a part by north the North Water&#146; (the area of Kincardine across the North Esk) at his own expense until the king had decided what to do with him  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1592&#150;9, 340). Queen Elizabeth, who had been kept fully informed, wrote to James expressing her gratitude and her confidence in leaving to him the punishment of Black, whose name she disdained to mention.<br>
<br>Early in the new year there were repeated appeals to the king to allow Black to return to his charge, as he had complied with the king's wishes, but to no avail. In July 1597 he was debarred by the king from returning to St Andrews, but permitted to settle in a rural parish. That year he was translated and admitted to the parish of Arbirlot in Forfarshire, left vacant by the translation of George Gladstanes to St Andrews. On 15 May 1598 Black was presented to the vicarage by the crown. He died, according to Calderwood, on 12 January 1603 in Dundee; his friend John Johnston, writing from St Andrews to Caspar Waser in Z&uuml;rich on 29 January 1603, gave 5 January as the date of his death. He was survived by his wife and their daughter.<br>
<br>Such colleagues as Andrew Melville, James Melvill, and John Johnston, who held Black in high esteem, wrote laudatory Latin verses in his memory. They were followed in their appreciation by presbyterian historians from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. But other writers have stressed that what was central to this controversy was not so much the question of the truth of the accusations brought against David Black, as of the right of the king and council to be his judges, and the judges of what ministers expounded in their pulpits.<br>
