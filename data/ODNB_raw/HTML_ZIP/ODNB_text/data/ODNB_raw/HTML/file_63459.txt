<span class="headword">Nadel,  Siegfried Ferdinand Stephan</span>  (1903&#150;1956), <span class="occ">social anthropologist and musicologist</span>, was born on 24 April 1903 at Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w), Galicia, Austria, the only son of the two children of Dr Moritz Nadel (<i>b</i>. 1871), a lawyer, and his wife, Adele Hirschsprung (1880&#150;1955). His parents were both born at Lemberg and of Jewish descent. From 1912 the family was registered in Vienna, Austria, where Nadel attended secondary school. In 1920 he began to study piano and composition at the Academy of Music, and from 1921 to 1925 musicology, psychology, and philosophy at the University of Vienna with the teachers Moritz Schlick (the founder of the Vienna circle of philosophy) and the Gestalt psychologist Karl B&uuml;hler. He graduated with the degree of doctor of philosophy with honours in 1925. The D&uuml;sseldorf opera house in Germany engaged him for a period as a temporary assistant conductor, despite his being only twenty-two. On 3 July 1926 he married Dr Lisbeth Braun (<i>b</i>. 30 Nov 1900), also a musicologist.<br>
<br>Nadel demonstrated an interest in comparative musicology from early in his career. In 1926&#150;7 he devised a number of radio programmes for Radio Vienna dealing with African, Caucasian, Javanese, and black American music. A participant at the International Congress of Folk Music in Prague in 1928, two years later he presented a treatise on marimba music to the Phonogrammarchivkommission of the Vienna Academy of Science. During the early 1930s Nadel began to research the musicology of primitive peoples at the Phonogrammarchiv in Berlin. He also began the study of African languages at the University of Berlin. A meeting with a representative of the Rockefeller Foundation gave Nadel the opportunity to escape the increasing antisemitic pressure: he was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship to train as a social anthropologist, for which his earlier studies had been an excellent preparation. In October 1932 he became a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics with Charles Gabriel Seligman and Bronislaw Malinowski. Nadel soon took a leading role in Malinowski's seminar, &#145;with the zest for constructive theoretical argument which was characteristic of him till the end of his days&#146;  (Firth, 118). His capacity for mastering languages proved to be of advantage in Britain, as well as during his fieldwork.<br>
<br>On Christmas eve 1933 Nadel, accompanied by his wife, started his research among the Nupe in Northern Nigeria. Returning to the London School of Economics in 1935 he was awarded a PhD degree for his thesis entitled &#145;Political and religious structure of Nupe society (Northern Nigeria)&#146;. With a group of other psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists he participated in discussions that led to the publication of <span class="italic">The Science of Society</span> (1939). From October 1935 to November 1936 he spent a further period investigating the Nupe. The fruits of his work were summarized in a number of articles and in two books, <span class="italic">A Black Byzantium</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">Nupe Religion</span> (1954).<br>
<br>In 1937 Sir Douglas Newbold, governor of the Kordofan province, invited Nadel to prepare a survey of the hill tribes scattered over the Nuba Mountains with whose administration the official governmental authorities had frequently experienced difficulties. Nadel worked among different tribes of the district for a year, having been appointed government anthropologist by the government of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. His analysis and suggestions were later published in his book <span class="italic">The Nuba</span> (1947), and in a number of articles. During the Second World War Nadel, by now a British citizen, joined the Sudan defence force and later the east African command of the British army. Holding the rank of major and then of lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed secretary of native affairs in the British military administration of Eritrea and Tripolitania. Service in the administration enabled him to put his experiences as anthropologist into practice. Through reforms he tried to improve the administrative system which the government authorities applied to tribal groups. In 1945 he was transferred to the home establishment, and received a gazetted commendation for outstanding services. In June 1946 he was released from military service and returned to London, to his wife and a daughter born during the war.<br>
<br>Nadel started his academic teaching career as a lecturer at the London School of Economics in 1946. Two years later he became reader in anthropology at King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne (then part of Durham University). He had long-standing interests in the theoretical side of his field, and especially in its status as a science; this led in 1951 to the publication of his <span class="italic">Foundations of Social Anthropology</span>. His stated intention was to examine the logical premises that underlay knowledge of all societies, primitive or otherwise. &#145;It was a bold enterprise&#146;, Raymond Firth later wrote, but &#145;in some respects, it was only partly successful&#146;  (Firth, 121). &#145;A magnificent teacher&#146;, he influenced several generations of students; and with his strong methodological bent &#145;he moved more than his colleagues, towards a new synthesis of social disciplines&#146;  (ibid., 122).<br>
<br>In 1950 Nadel was appointed to the first chair in anthropology at the new Australian National University in Canberra. As well as setting up the new department, he became dean of the research school of Pacific studies. On 14 July 1956 Nadel died unexpectedly, in Canberra, of a coronary thrombosis, not yet fifty-three years old. Seven days earlier he had completed the manuscript of <span class="italic">The Theory of Social Structure</span> (1957), which became a standard work; his wife survived him.<br>
