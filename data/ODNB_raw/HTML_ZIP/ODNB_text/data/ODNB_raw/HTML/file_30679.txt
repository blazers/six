</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Belcher,  John</span>  (1841&#150;1913), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 10 July 1841 at 3 Montague Terrace, Trinity Square, London, the eldest of the ten children of John Belcher (1816/17&#150;1890), architect, and his first wife, Anne Woollett, a descendant of Philip Woollett, father of the engraver William Woollett (1735&#150;1785). The family were members of the Catholic Apostolic church, in which Belcher was a minister throughout his life. He was educated at private schools and at Luxembourg, and after spending a few months in Paris as an architectural student (1862&#150;3) he became a partner in his father's architectural practice in 1865. On 8 June that year he married Florence, daughter of Matthew Parker, a minister, of Dublin. They had no children.<br>
<br>After his father's retirement in 1875 Belcher was joined by James W. James until 1882, and from 1885 to 1897 was in partnership with Arthur Beresford Pite. Together they had a strong influence on the development of the grand manner in late nineteenth-century architecture, not only through their executed work, but also through their unsuccessful competition entry for the Victoria and Albert Museum (1891), which was widely discussed within the profession.<br>
<br>Belcher was also sympathetic to arts and crafts ideas; indeed, he took the chair at the first meeting of the Art-Workers' Guild, an organization devoted to raising the status of the decorative arts. He compared the architect to the conductor of an orchestra, &#145;leading and directing the executants in the interpretation of a work of his own composition&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 21, 1913, 77). He was particularly keen that the sculptor should work with the architect from the early days of a commission as &#145;the most perfect achievement can be attained by their joint action&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the RIBA</span>, new ser., 8, 1892, 49). But he rejected the insistence on taking vernacular buildings as the source of a new style.<br>
<br>Instead, Genoese baroque&#151;an enthusiasm Belcher developed on a trip to Italy&#151;seemed to offer a model for the incorporation of sculpture and painting in the service of architecture, while allowing a free treatment of the classical tradition. There is evidence of this at the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Moorgate Place, London (1890&#150;93), a building with a complex programme of exterior sculpture by Harry Bates and Hamo Thornycroft, an old family friend. If Belcher claimed that every detail of this building had been worked out by himself, other contemporary sources make it clear that it was jointly designed with Pite. Some recent writers have tended to downplay Belcher's role, seeing him as the business-minded front man to Pite the designer, but it seems more likely to have been a real design partnership. Yet Pite, who wrote Belcher's entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, mentioned neither himself nor John James Joass, who worked in the office as assistant from 1897 and partner from 1905, and was equally influential on the later work of the firm.<br>
<br>Belcher's Colchester town hall (1898&#150;1902) shows that he was capable of producing good work independently. He cannot have received any help from Pite, who entered the competition separately, and the real impact of Joass in the office had yet to be felt. Indeed, the last building which can be said to be more Belcher than Joass was the Ashton memorial, Williamson Park, Lancaster (designed 1904, built 1907&#150;9), a gargantuan folly paid for by Lord Ashton as a memorial to his family, where English sources were now stronger. In 1901 he had published, with Mervyn Macartney, <span class="italic">Later Renaissance Architecture in England</span>, a close study that served as a visual textbook for the developing English classical revival.<br>
<br>In later work the hand of Joass became more dominant as illness restricted Belcher's contribution. Mappin House, 158&#150;62 Oxford Street, London (1906&#150;8), the former Royal Insurance building at the corner of St James's and Piccadilly (1907&#150;8), Whiteley's stores, Bayswater (1910&#150;12), and Holy Trinity Church, Kingsway (1910&#150;12), all show the bolder touch of a designer trained to detail for Glasgow masons.<br>
<br>Joass wrote that Belcher &#145;was endowed with a most receptive and inquiring type of mind&#146;, and that &#145;new ideas appealed to him irresistibly&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 22, 1915, 125). This helps to explain the stylistic variety of his work, from red brick Gothic influenced by William Burges in the Mappin and Webb building, Queen Victoria Street, London (1870&#150;72, dem.), to Norman Shaw &#145;Queen Anne&#146; in the aptly named Queen Anne Chambers, 1 Poultry, London (1875, dem.), or Stowell Park, Gloucestershire (1886), for the earl of Eldon. It explains also the strong influence of his much younger partners.<br>
<br>Belcher's friends remarked upon his unassuming modesty, which, combined with a &#145;quiet insistence and determination&#146;, made him an ideal president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (1904&#150;6) at a time of division within the profession. He was awarded the 1907 royal gold medal for architecture, and in the same year published <span class="italic">Essentials in Architecture</span>, a primer aimed at the architectural student. The other great interest in his life was music: he performed publicly as a solo bass singer, and lectured the Royal Institute of British Architects on church organs, and on the musical requirements of church planning. He also published a <span class="italic">History of Ecclesiastical Music</span> (1872).<br>
<br>Belcher was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1900 and Royal Academician in 1909. He died on 8 November 1913 at his home, Redholm, Champion Hill, Surrey, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
