<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Service,  James</span>  (1823&#150;1899), <span class="occ">politician and businessman in Australia</span>, was born on 27 November 1823 at Kilwinning, Ayrshire, the son of Robert Service (1794&#150;1883), a sewing agent and lay preacher, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Niven. He was educated at Kilwinning and at Glasgow College and opened a school at Saltcoats, but had to abandon it when he contracted tuberculosis. In 1846 he joined the tea and coffee business of Thomas Corbett &amp; Co. in Glasgow, and became a partner. About 1850 he married Marian Allan; they had two daughters, but the marriage broke down in the 1850s.<br>
<br>Service emigrated to Victoria, Australia, in 1853. His parents soon followed and his father, a staunch &#145;moral force&#146; Chartist, became prominent in the Churches of Christ and the temperance movement. James Service founded an importing house specializing in Robur tea, was a founder of the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1866 and chairman of directors from 1871 to 1881, and became an active chairman of the Alfred Hospital's board (1871&#150;86). Soon known as a &#145;red-hot&#146; Chartist, he gained political experience as chairman of the Emerald Hill &#145;model municipality&#146;. He was elected to the legislative assembly in 1857 and joined William Nicholson's ministry as president of the board of land and works (27 October 1859 &#150; 3 September 1860); supporting the populist land convention, he carried a radical bill designed to wipe out the &#145;social evil&#146; of land monopoly. The legislative council returned it with some 250 amendments and, when Nicholson caved in, Service resigned from the ministry. He brought about provision for state aid to the Jewish religion, helped to force through the <span class="roman">Common Schools Act</span> of 1862, and carried the (Sir Robert Richard) Torrens reform of land transfer.<br>
<br>After two years in Europe, Service returned in 1865 but was not re-elected until 1874, when he became treasurer (31 July 1874&#150;7 August 1875) in G. B. Kerferd's ministry. His bold budget, which attempted to systematize the tariff and introduce direct taxation, led to the ministry's downfall. In 1877 the radical protectionist Graham Berry came to power. After &#145;black Wednesday&#146;&#151;8 January 1878&#151;when judges and civil servants were dismissed, Service soon became leader of the opposition and brought Berry down, but his scheme for reforming relations between the two houses was unpopular and his five months' premiership (5 March&#150;3 August 1880) was unproductive. He resigned his seat and again set out on a long excursion to Europe.<br>
<br>In the Victorian context, protectionists were usually called &#145;liberals&#146; and free-traders &#145;conservatives&#146;. Service was a free-trader who did not &#145;go conservative&#146; and was prepared to compromise sensibly over the tariff: as he said of himself, in a speech in 1883, he was &#145;a liberal of the Gladstone stamp&#146;. He had strong egalitarian sympathies and supported the rights of trade unions but stressed the mutual interests of the classes; he gave bonuses, pegged to the firm's profits, to his own employees.<br>
<br>On his return from Europe Service formed a coalition with Berry (8 March 1883&#150;18 February 1886). It was a triumph. He reformed the civil service and the railways, and abolished patronage; the public service board and the railways commission were established in 1883. As treasurer, he did not allow the boom to get out of control. Alfred Deakin revered Service as a model premier conducting a cabinet in which nothing was muddled.<br>
<br>Service's main contribution was to encourage the Australian colonies onto the international stage and to originate a sustained campaign for federal union. He backed Queensland's attempt to annex New Guinea and used the French threat to annex the New Hebrides to force a federal &#145;convention&#146; in November 1883. He won agreement to confederate and form a federal council, but New South Wales and South Australia refused to co-operate; the council was hamstrung from the start, though it continued to meet into the 1890s. Colonial Office officials saw Service as disloyal and ignorant, but modified their views after German annexation of north-eastern New Guinea and French occupation of the New Hebrides. Believing in the empire's civilizing mission and in Australia's destiny as a nation, however unwisely enthusiastic, Service was a harbinger of new imperial expansion and definition of Australian regional interests. His contribution to the federal movement has never been adequately recognized.<br>
<br>On urgent medical advice, Service resigned the premiership in February 1886 and went overseas again. While away, he was a vigorous Victorian delegate to the 1887 colonial conference. He rejected the offer of a privy councillorship as he had earlier a knighthood. He joined the legislative council in 1888, but resisted all efforts to recall him to prominence. In 1889 he persuaded the Melbourne chamber of commerce to contribute &pound;500 to the striking London dockers. At the Melbourne banquet to the intercolonial conference members in 1890 he made the famous reference to the tariff being &#145;the lion in the way&#146; to federation, and was a leading conciliator during the major strikes of 1890&#150;91. In his last years he devoted himself, chairman once again, to rescuing the Commercial Bank from its parlous condition.<br>
<br>Service was a lean, sprightly, tallish man, balding with a full grey beard. Courteous and sociable, he bore few grudges and did not resort to personalities. He had no trace of snobbishness. His honesty was patent and, while adept at compromise, he was no trimmer. He was not an orator, but, as Deakin wrote, his &#145;strength lay in the lucidity of his thought and the singularity of his language, his skill in marshalling masses of facts or figures&#146;  (<span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, Australasian edn, November 1892). He was highly cultivated and well read, reminding J. A. Froude of a philosopher or an Anglican bishop. He had been a sceptic since his youth but retained an interest in religious questions. Most extraordinary of all in Victorian Melbourne&#151;having separated from his wife, about 1860 he took another &#145;wife&#146;, Louisa Hoseason Forty, lived down the gossip, and won wide affection as a public figure.<br>
<br>Service died in East St Kilda, Melbourne, on 12 April 1899 and was buried in Melbourne general cemetery on the 14th. He was survived by Louisa Forty and their daughters.<br>
