<span class="headword">Addison,  Henry Robert</span>  (1805&#150;1876), <span class="occ">playwright and army officer</span>, was born of Irish parentage in 1805 at Calcutta, and spent his early life in India. He acquired on 12 July 1827 a commission in the cavalry as cornet in the 2nd dragoon guards, and progressed to lieutenant on 15 March 1831. Part of his army service was spent in western Ireland during the period of Daniel O'Connell's election in co. Clare in 1828. On 10 December 1828 he married at Limerick Mary, daughter of Thomas Phillips Vokes; they had at least one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In June 1833 Addison went on half pay. His first extant plays were melodramas with songs or operettas specially written for Mrs Waylett: <span class="italic">Lo Zingaro</span>, <span class="italic">Jessie, the Flower of Dumblaine</span>, and <span class="italic">The Butterfly's Ball</span> (all performed at the Adelphi, 1833). Addison was adept at catching the public mood: all his early plays were successful and many were printed. During the 1835&#150;6 season several were performed at Drury Lane and Covent Garden, and about this time he joined the Dramatic Authors' Society, of which most leading playwrights were members. In August 1836 he leased the Queen's Theatre, Fitzroy Square, with Mrs Waylett again as his star, but this excursion into management failed to last the season.<br>
<br>As recommended in his guidebook for the English resident, <span class="italic">Belgium as she is</span> (1838), Addison in 1837 settled temporarily in Bruges, where it was possible to live more cheaply than in Britain while retaining contact through a largish expatriate community. Here he attempted his first fictional writing with <span class="italic">Diary of a Judge</span> (1838)&#151;six &#145;strictly original&#146; tales of crime and justice in Napoleon's time&#151;and also met Charles Lever, whom he pestered for space in his <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>. The lively series of &#145;Dramatic doings&#146; (1840&#150;41) which resulted drew partly on his experience as a raw recruit to play writing, and included surprisingly frank portraits of prominent contemporaries such as Bunn, Fitzball, Planch&eacute;, and Moncrieff. Lever described Addison in 1841 as a portly, flamboyant bon viveur with well-waxed moustache, disposed to tall stories. He is fictionalized as the comic Captain Bubbleton in Lever's picaresque novel of the Napoleonic period, <span class="italic">Tom Burke of &#145;Ours&#146;</span> (1844), where his extravagant boasting is redeemed by his loyalty to the hero. Addison's discursive, casual style was well suited to his inventive anecdotal versions of his Indian experiences for <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> (1841&#150;5) and <span class="italic">Ainsworth's Magazine</span> (1848). At the same time he resumed his dramatic career in London, principally writing successful farces such as <span class="italic">Sophie's Supper</span> (1849), <span class="italic">No. 117 Arundel Street, Strand</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">Locked in with a Lady</span> (1863). Three of his plays&#151;he is said to have written more than sixty&#151;were still in print, in <span class="roman">Dicks's Standard Plays</span>, at the end of the century. In 1849&#150;50 he edited the first <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, then an almanac and lists of public officials.<br>
<br>In 1865 Addison published <span class="italic">Behind the Curtain</span>, a moderately successful three-volume sensational novel featuring sibling rivalry, baby substitution, abduction, madness, and attempted murder, and ending with the hero's restoration to his inheritance. His <span class="italic">Recollections of an Irish Police Magistrate</span> (1862) drew on his own experiences, as well as chronicling the detective work of his father-in-law, Thomas Phillips Vokes, Limerick's magistrate during the troubles of the late 1820s and early 1830s. On a lower level was <span class="italic">&#145;All at Sea&#146;: Recollections of a Half-Pay Officer</span> (1863), a loosely connected series of tales told by, or to, a would-be missionary <i>en route</i> for Africa. Addison knew Paris well as a sometime resident&#151;he was a reporter for the London papers at the 1867 Paris Universal Exhibition&#151;and his last work was a brief, though graphic, account of a visit to Paris after the 1870 commune, when mutilated bodies still littered the streets. He died aged seventy-one at his home, 32 Albion Street, Hyde Park, London, on 24 June 1876.<br>
