<span class="headword">Percy,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Egremont  (1422&#150;1460), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21933/', "Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (1394&#150;1455)")</script>, and Eleanor Neville, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland")</script>. Born on 29 November 1422 at the Percy manor of Leconfield, Yorkshire, he has been described as &#145;Quarrelsome, violent and contemptuous of all authority&#146;  (Storey, 125). As a young man he was embroiled in riots and disturbances which may have embarrassed his father and elder brother, Lord Poynings [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21934/', "Percy, Henry, third earl of Northumberland")</script>]. In July 1447 he was involved in a skirmish at Stamford Bridge with tenants of the archbishop of York, with whom the Percys had been at odds; he was imprisoned at York as a result. Thereafter, Thomas concentrated on consolidating his family's power in Cumberland, where he held the Percy honour of Cockermouth. His father was doubtless instrumental in securing his creation, by royal patent, as Baron Egremont, a title derived from the Percy castle in Cumberland, on 20 November 1449, in expectation of his &#145;keping of the rest and pees of oure lande&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings &hellip; of the Privy Council</span>, 6.159), together with a modest annual grant of &pound;10 from Cumberland's revenue. His regime in Cumberland was turbulent: during 1449&#150;53 he was involved in disorder, lawlessness, and attacks on royal officials, including the sheriff (1453). This intensified Percy rivalry with the Nevilles, which the election of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95127/', "William Percy")</script> as bishop of Carlisle in August 1452 doubtless accentuated. Nevertheless, on a visit to London in February 1452, he joined the king in confronting the duke of York at Dartford, Kent. By 1453 Egremont was recruiting followers on the Percy estates in Yorkshire and in the city of York, where he quarrelled with John Neville, the earl of Salisbury's younger son. In June both were summoned to the king's council; Egremont refused to respond and in July he was accordingly instructed to keep the peace and even to prepare to sail to Gascony. Towards the end of July an inquiry into disturbances in all the northern shires led to an order to Egremont and John Neville to keep the peace on pain of forfeiture; Northumberland and Salisbury were required to ensure their sons' good behaviour. But on 24 August Egremont, his brother Richard, and a large retinue of Yorkshiremen, with others from Cockermouth, attacked a Neville party returning from the wedding of Thomas Neville and Lord Cromwell's niece at Tattershall, Lincolnshire, to Sheriff Hutton, Yorkshire; at Heworth, near York, the ambush involved almost the entire Percy and Neville clans. The situation remained explosive, and in October another clash seemed likely between Percys and Nevilles at Topcliffe. When the duke of Exeter, for his own dynastic and territorial reasons, intervened on the Percys' side, the feud acquired a new dimension. Egremont met Exeter in January 1454 and at Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, &#145;ben sworne togider&#146;  (Gairdner, 2.296). After Egremont was reported to be raising forces in preparation for the forthcoming parliament, he was summoned to attend the council on 3 March and, following condemnation in parliament, another summons was issued on 10 May. That same month, the duke of York, as protector of the realm, decided to move in person against Egremont and Exeter and the men they were assembling at Spofforth and elsewhere in Yorkshire, Cumberland, and Westmorland; they were even negotiating with the Scots. Exeter, Egremont, and Richard Percy fled, but a commission at York in June investigated their activities: recruiting men and giving livery to those who were not their personal retainers, lawyers, or servants. Although Exeter was apprehended, Egremont eluded capture. At the end of October 1454, at Stamford Bridge, the Percys, led by Egremont and Richard, fought a battle with the Nevilles; the two Percys were captured and, in November, condemned by justices who ordered them to pay the Nevilles &pound;11,200; both were consigned to Newgate prison. Two years later Egremont escaped, much to the Nevilles' anger.<br>
<br>By 1458 the Percys were valued allies of the Lancastrian monarch. At the formal reconciliation of leading nobles organized by Henry VI in March 1458, Egremont concluded a bond of 10,000 marks with York and the Nevilles; but the large fine previously imposed on him was reduced to a bond of 4000 marks to keep the peace for ten years towards Salisbury, his family, and retainers. Moreover, in June, Egremont was granted for life the castle and manor of Wressle, Yorkshire, the former Percy manor whose possession by Lord Cromwell had been at the heart of the disturbances of 1453. A fortnight later he received permission to leave the realm with twelve servants in order to go on pilgrimage, as he promised at the March reconciliation. Whether he did so or not is unclear. He had certainly returned to England by December 1459, when he was granted the constableship of the duke of York's forfeited castle of Conisbrough, along with a life annuity of &pound;40. Egremont was at the battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460, fighting in support of Henry VI whom Warwick captured. He was probably beheaded after the battle: Warwick could be pardoned if he felt satisfaction that the bane of his family's fortunes in the north for a dozen years had been dispatched. Percy is not known to have married, but his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57620/', "Sir John Egremont")</script>, was born <i>c</i>.1459.<br>
