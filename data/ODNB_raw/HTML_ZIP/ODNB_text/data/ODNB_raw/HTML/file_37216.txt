<span class="headword">Braham,  John Robert Daniel</span>  (1920&#150;1974), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at the manse, Holcombe, Somerset, on 6 April 1920, the only son (there was also a daughter) of Ernest Goodall Braham, a Church of England clergyman and himself a Royal Flying Corps pilot in the First World War, and his wife, Ethel Randall. He was educated at Taunton School, Somerset, but left before he was seventeen to work in the Lancashire county police as a boy clerk in Wigan. In December 1937 he applied for a short-service commission in the RAF, and to his evident amazement was accepted and sent for elementary flying training in 90 m.p.h. Tiger Moths. He received his wings at Shawbury near Shrewsbury in 1938. Though chafing to fly single-engined fighters, by the outbreak of war he was still flying twin-engined Blenheim F1 night fighters in 29 squadron from Debden, Essex. With several pilots called John already in his squadron, Braham's radio call sign became Bob, and this remained his service nickname for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>On 24 August 1940, flying from Digby, Lincolnshire, Braham downed his first victim&#151;a Norwegian-based Heinkel III night intruder&#151; over the North Sea off Spurn Head. In 1941 he teamed up with his remarkable navigator and operator of the then new airborne AI radar set, William James Gregory, known as Sticks because of his proficiency as a drummer. This pair became the most formidable night-fighting combination in the RAF. By 12 November the thrice-decorated Braham had destroyed twelve enemy aircraft and in 1942 he was posted to command 141 squadron at Ford, near Chichester, Sussex, as the youngest wing commander in the RAF. After a period supporting Coastal Command based at Predannock, Cornwall, in 1943 Braham was switched to the experimental task of escorting bomber streams over Europe. For this purpose sensitive Serrate detectors were fitted into Beaufighters&#151;aircraft which had been developed by the Bristol Aircraft Company from the &#145;Britain First&#146;, with substantial private sponsorship.<br>
<br>In February 1944, after his twentieth victory, nineteen of them at night, Braham was taken off intruder and escort work and put in charge of night operations at 2 light bomber group headquarters. Typically he extracted an understanding from his air officer commanding, Basil Embry, that he would still be allowed a &#145;ration&#146; of operational flights. After he had raised his score to twenty-nine, and now uniquely entitled to wear the ribbons of both the DSO and the DFC, each with two silver rosettes denoting two bars, Braham's luck ran out over Denmark on 25 June 1944. He was jumped by a Focke Wulf FW 190 flown by the German ace Robert Spreckels, and forced down on to a Danish beach. Braham flew 316 operational sorties and was hit eleven times in forty-one attacks on his aircraft. He also survived five crash landings.<br>
<br>Braham was developing combat fatigue. Despite his consummate low-flying ability he had already had a brush with some trees and had also once even grazed the ground in a Mosquito. Some felt he owed his life to spending the last ten months of the war in Stalag Luft 3 at Sagan, near Breslau. But for the intervention of a lone SS soldier in black battledress, he and his navigator, the Australian Donald Walsh, might well have been lynched by a hostile crowd aboard the train carrying them to interrogation. Braham was liberated by the British 11th armoured division near L&uuml;beck on 2 May 1945. He was wearing the tunic in which he had been shot down. Depressed by what he perceived as a work-shy post-war Britain, Braham in May 1952 sailed with his wife and his three young sons to take up a commission in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He was posted as a group captain to SHAPE headquarters in Paris in 1960.<br>
<br>Since 1914 only ten British officers had ever been six times decorated for gallantry. Braham, who was one of these, uniquely achieved a seventh decoration: in 1951 he was awarded the AFC for hazardous developmental work on all-weather fighter aircraft. He was also awarded by the Belgians their Croix de Guerre and the order of the Crown. His book <span class="italic">&#145;Scramble!&#146;</span> was published in London in 1961 and described frankly and modestly the unrelenting exploits of one of the sharpest thorns in the side of the Luftwaffe. In April 1941 he married Joan Helen, the daughter of Edward Hyde, a grocer, of Leicester. Braham died in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 7 February 1974.<br>
