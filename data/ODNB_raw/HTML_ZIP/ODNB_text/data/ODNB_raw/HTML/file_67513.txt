<span class="headword">Arbuthnott,  Robert</span>, first viscount of Arbuthnott  (<em>c.</em>1618&#150;1655), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest of seven children of Sir Robert Arbuthnott (<i>d</i>. 1633) of Arbuthnott in Kincardineshire and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat. He succeeded his father following his death on 15 March 1633, but as he was still under age, his affairs were initially administered by his uncle James Arbuthnott of Dulladies who, along with Robert Arbuthnott of Findowrie and James Burnett of Craigmyle, had been appointed tutors by his father's will. Identified as a covenanter in 1638, he would became one of the leading figures in the movement in the north-east of Scotland. At some time before 1639 he married his first wife, Lady Marjorie (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of David Carnegie, first earl of Southesk, and widow of William Halyburton of Pitcur; they had two children, Robert and Margaret. At the age of about twenty-three he was created viscount of Arbuthnott and lord of Bervie (or Inverbervie) by patent dated 17 November 1641 at the palace of Holyroodhouse. He was a ruling elder in the 1641 general assembly and in 1645 and 1649 was one of the ruling elders appointed to the commission for public affairs of the kirk.<br>
<br>Arbuthnott attended the 1643&#150;4 conventions of estates and the first triennial parliament of 1644&#150;7 and was nominated to important committees with procedural, financial, and military remits. He was a member of the committee for the north, appointed by the 1644 convention on 16 April, and the committee for the northern business, appointed by the 1644 parliament on 19 July. On 24 January 1645 he was nominated a member of the committee for assisting Lieutenant-General Baillie in his campaign against Montrose, while on 10 July he was elected a member of the committee to remain with the army at Perth. He was included on the committee of estates of 8 March 1645, the exchequer commission of 8 March, and the session committee of 1 December dealing with bills and ratifications. In the field of financial affairs, he was also appointed to the committee for moneys (3 February 1646) and the committee for considering and clearing the common burdens of the kingdom (30 January 1647).<br>
<br>One of the more radical covenanting lords, Robert Baillie, noted that in the 1648 session of parliament Arbuthnott was one of only eight or nine nobles who were hostile to the engagement. With the defeat of the engager party he was appointed a privy councillor on 16 March 1649, and was a member of the commission for the plantation of kirks and the valuation of teinds (15 March 1649) and the commissions for the visitation of the universities of St Andrews (16 January 1649) and Aberdeen (31 July 1649). He used the 1649 parliament to complain about the losses, estimated at &pound;80,000 Scots, which he had suffered on his Kincardineshire estates in March 1645 at the hands of Montrose's royalist forces. Arbuthnott therefore claimed exemption from the proposed levy of February 1649 and this was accepted by parliament on 16 March. On 25 February Arbuthnott had been appointed colonel of the foot for the Mearns and part of Aberdeenshire, although it seems that by 1650 Arbuthnott's foot had not been properly raised. Sir James Balfour noted that Arbuthnott was one of the twelve dissenters of 25 November 1650 who voted against the declaration of the committee of estates, condemning the western remonstrance which had denounced alleged breaches of the covenants and criticized the government's support for an unrepentant Charles II. Following the Cromwellian conquest, he was appointed one of the eleven commissioners for Perth, Fife, and Forfarshire as part of the 1654 commission for visiting the universities, colleges, and schools of learning in Scotland. After the death of his first wife, Marjorie (22 December 1651), he married, on 30 June 1653, his cousin Katherine (1622&#150;1663), daughter of Hugh Fraser, eighth Lord Lovat, and widow of Sir John Sinclair of Dunbeath. With his second wife he had two further children, Alexander and Anna. He died on 10 October 1655.<br>
