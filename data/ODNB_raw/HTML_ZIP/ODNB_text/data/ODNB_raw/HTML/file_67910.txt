<span class="headword">Broadhurst,  Robert</span>  (1859/60&#150;1948), <span class="occ">pan-African nationalist leader</span>, was born probably in Sierra Leone, the son of a Manchester merchant, John S. Broadhurst, who had a business there; his mother, whose name is unknown, was from Sierra Leone. He was sent to Britain to be educated at Nantwich, in Cheshire, about 1869; seven years later he returned to Sierra Leone. Back in England in 1905 he worked for the family firm, Broadhurst &amp; Sons in Manchester, until 1909, when the company vanishes from the Manchester directories and Robert Broadhurst is no longer listed as residing at St Anne's-on-Sea, a salubrious area. In 1912 Broadhurst is reported in the <span class="italic">Sierre Leone Weekly News</span> as a cocoa merchant. From 1916 to 1918 he worked as an agent for the Niger Company in Jos and Lokoja, and then as a general merchant in Freetown and Conakry. By 1936, when <span class="italic">West Africa</span> noted him as a &#145;senior commercial agent&#146;, he had been a UK resident for some years, with offices in the City.<br>
<br>In Britain Broadhurst became involved in black politics, and in 1911 he attended the Universal Races Congress, an apolitical gathering sponsored by philanthropists. He was a founder member of the African Progress Union (APU) and its first secretary from 1918 to 1921, and he remained on the union's executive committee until the APU's demise in 1927. The APU was a political organization formed to &#145;promote the social and economic welfare of Africans in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gold Coast Leader</span>). It protested, for example, against the restoration of African colonies to Germany in 1918, and at the end of the First World War asked that the &#145;principle of self-determination for weaker races &hellip; will be applied to the African colonies&#146; and that an &#145;African adviser&#146; should be included in the British peace treaty delegation  (Greene). The APU protested against the lack of protection offered by the police during the anti-black riots in Liverpool in 1919, against the &#145;flogging and shooting of natives in British East Africa&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>) in 1923, and in 1921 announced its intention to set up a hostel for Africans who were experiencing racial discrimination in their attempts to find lodgings.<br>
<br>Broadhurst was also an active member of the West African Students Union and was involved in the many protests regarding the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935. The breadth of his political involvement is demonstrated by his service with two organizations that were under the aegis of the socialist anti-imperialist activist George Padmore: he was treasurer of the International African Service Bureau from its formation in 1937 and president of the first Pan-African Federation. Broadhurst is noted in the press as attending a variety of political and welfare functions organized by black people; his lack of sectarianism and overwhelming desire to aid and support his people is also proved by his membership of the London branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, created by Marcus Garvey.<br>
<br>Broadhurst was also involved internationally. Through the APU he was in contact with members of the National Congress of British West Africa, both by correspondence and also in person, when the congress delegates visited Britain in 1920&#150;21 seeking constitutional and electoral reforms. Other delegations supported by Broadhurst in his capacity as APU secretary were those from South Africa in Britain in 1919, petitioning the king for &#145;Freedom, Liberty, Justice and Fairplay&#146; and representation at the peace conference, and Nigerian nationalists Herbert Macaulay and Chief Oluwa, pressing land claims. He was also in touch with other west African nationalist and commercial interests: for example he was associated with the West African Co-Operative Producers Ltd, started by Gold Coaster W. Tete-Ansa, and with the delegates of the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society of the Gold Coast visiting Britain in 1935&#150;6. Through letters to west African papers such as <span class="italic">The Aurora</span> of Freetown he informed west Africans of events in Britain of relevance to them.<br>
<br>In 1921 he was the &#145;English&#146; secretary for the Pan-African Congress organized by W. E. B. DuBois, whom he had met at the 1911 congress in London; he is noted as attending with his daughter, who would have been one of the few women present. The congress's demands included an end to expropriation of land by &#145;the unrestrained greed of invested capital&#146;, and local government for &#145;backward groups, deliberately rising to complete self-government&#146;. He also attended the Paris sessions of the 1921 congress. However, neither he nor other prominent west Africans in Britain attended the 1923 congress, which met in London and Lisbon, perhaps as a result of disagreements that had arisen in 1921 with the congress's organizer.<br>
<br>From about 1939 until 1948 Broadhurst was vice-consul for the Republic of Liberia in London. How he obtained this position is not known. He was still active in his eighties, and was part of the delegation that in 1944 met Walter White, the American civil rights leader and official of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In 1945 he attended the Pan-African Congress in Manchester as Liberia's representative. Robert Broadhurst died, aged eighty-eight, in Hackney Hospital on 10 December 1948. His funeral took place in Hampstead parish church; his son, also a merchant, is noted as having attended.<br>
<br>Nnamdi Azikiwe, future president of Nigeria, recalled in his memoirs that in 1934, as he was about to leave London, Robert Broadhurst &#145;blessed me and wished me godspeed and prayed that God might guide me in my humble efforts to serve Africa&#146;  (Azikiwe, 212). He described Broadhurst as &#145;an elderly gentleman of African descent &hellip; mentally virile and very progressive in his ideas&#146;  (ibid.). That Broadhurst certainly was; some four years before his death his erstwhile colleague in 1930s London, I. T. A. Wallace Johnson, later a political leader in Sierra Leone, called him &#145;the Grand Old Man of African nationalism&#146;  (<span class="italic">African Standard</span>).<br>
