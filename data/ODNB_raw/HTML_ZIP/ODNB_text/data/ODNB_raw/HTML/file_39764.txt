<span class="headword">Bulkley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilford; <em>other married name </em>Barrisford]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1747/8?&#150;1792), <span class="occ">dancer and actress</span>, was the daughter of Edward Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1789), a minor official at Covent Garden. Wilford's sister Priscilla Steevens had in 1744 married John Rich, the proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre, as her second husband. Mary was brought up in some comfort at the centre of the theatrical establishment and moved naturally into a career on the stage.<br>
<br>Mary first appeared at Covent Garden in 1758 as a dancer, and in 1761 she became a member of the company. She remained with them until 1780, first as a dancer (until 1765) and thereafter as an actress specializing chiefly in comedy. Her acting d&eacute;but was as Miranda in Susanna Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span>. She later played all the main female roles in Shakespearian comedy, as well as Cordelia and Portia, and innumerable parts in contemporary plays. She was the first Miss Richland in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Good-Natur'd Man</span> (1768), the first Kate Hardcastle in his <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (1773), and the first Julia in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1775). Her beauty helped to ensure her initial success. Hugh Kelly praised her thus:<blockquote>
<div>Blest with a person wholly without fault;<br>
</div>
<div>Tho' polish'd, gay, and natural, though taught,<br>
</div>
<div>See where that Wilford elegantly moves,<br>
</div>
<div>Leads up the graces, and commands the loves.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Thespis II</span>, 1767)</blockquote>He noted, however, that her voice was not strong, and in his life of Johnson James Boswell records an occasion in 1773 when Goldsmith commented that she could not sing.<br>
<br>In her personal life Mary was exuberant and profligate. Her marriage to George Bulkley (<i>d</i>. 1784), of the Covent Garden orchestra, on 9 August 1767 produced a daughter, of whom nothing is known after her baptism at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 9 November 1768. Bulkley had &#145;a grateful heart and useful virtues&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span>, vol. 2) but she found him dull. In the summer of 1768, during the annual closure of the London theatres, when metropolitan actors customarily worked in the provinces, the Bulkleys were engaged at the King Street Theatre, Bristol. Also in the company were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7738/', "James William Dodd (c.1740&#150;1796)")</script> and his wife, Martha, both of Drury Lane. Mary Bulkley's indiscretions with Dodd gave rise to scandal and Martha refused to accompany her husband again to Bristol in the following year. She died shortly afterwards and public sympathy moved against the lovers. The relationship persisted, however. In London they worked in separate theatres and were on the whole successful; in the vacations they worked together with mixed fortunes. In the summer of 1774 they had a disastrous season in Dublin:&#145;Some recent transactions had excited strong prejudices against them&#146;  (Hitchcock, 2.259). Dodd was left penniless and was bailed out by Garrick, and Bulkley returned temporarily to her husband. In contrast their season for Tate Wilkinson in York in 1779 was highly successful. They had by this time set up house together, an arrangement which lasted until another scandal erupted, this time with Dodd as the wronged party. Mary's lovers were reputed to include John Banks, a notable Harlequin, and John Brown Williamson, a minor actor.<br>
<br>Mary Bulkley ceased to appear regularly at Covent Garden after the 1779&#150;80 season and her career was clearly in decline. From 1781 until 1788 she worked in the summers at the Haymarket Theatre. She was engaged by Drury Lane for one season only, in 1783&#150;4, and she made one last, single appearance at Covent Garden in 1789&#150;90. In the winter months, with neither of the patent theatres employing her, she was probably hard-pressed for money. She reached the bottom of her career as a member of a company of strolling actors in Shrewsbury in 1784. Edward Cape Everard, another Covent Garden child dancer whose own downward spiral had set in early, relates in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of an Unfortunate Son of Thespis</span> (1818) the arrival of John Jackson, proprietor of the Edinburgh theatre, who recruited four of the Shrewsbury troupe for his own company. Jackson remembered Mary Bulkley as a girl, with admiration and affection, and was clearly rescuing her.<br>
<br>Sadly public disapproval followed Mary to Scotland and her first benefit was a failure, but she overcame the hostility when she played Hamlet successfully on 23 March 1784. On 22 July 1788 she married Captain Ebenezer Barrisford and used his name henceforward. She remained with the Edinburgh company until 1791, by which time she was drinking heavily. She died in poverty on 19 December 1792 in Dumfries, survived by her husband; the <span class="italic">Newcastle Courant</span> of 29 December 1792 gave her age as forty-four. She was buried in Dumfries churchyard.<br>
