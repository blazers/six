<span class="headword">Norman,  Conolly</span>  (1853&#150;1908), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born on 12 March 1853 at All Saints' Glebe, Newtown Cunningham, co. Donegal, Ireland, the fifth of six sons of Hugh Norman, rector of All Saints', and his wife, Anne, daughter of Captain William Ball of Buncrana, co. Donegal. Several members of the Norman family served as mayor of Londonderry and two represented the city in parliament. Conolly Norman studied at Trinity College, Dublin, the Carmichael medical school, and the House of Industry hospitals. He received the licences of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1874. Four years later he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and in 1890 he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He worked at the Bethlem Hospital in London before returning to Ireland in 1882 to take up the post of medical superintendent at Castlebar Asylum, co. Mayo (1882&#150;5) and then at Monaghan Asylum (1885&#150;6).<br>
<br>Norman was appointed medical superintendent of the largest psychiatric hospital in Ireland in 1886. This was the Richmond District Asylum in Dublin, later St Brendan's Hospital. At that time conditions within the asylum were very primitive and it was described as being more like a prison than a hospital. Norman was committed to reform and he strove consistently to introduce more humane practices. He also sought to incorporate a scientific approach in psychiatry. He published several papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span> and in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Ireland</span>. These papers included reports on the mental state in aphasia, an unusual case of brain tumour, an account of senile dementia, and medication trials. He also published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> and was for very many years joint editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span>.<br>
<br>In 1899 Norman reported an epidemic of beriberi in the Richmond Asylum in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland</span>. Beriberi is a condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine), and it is found mainly in rice-eating communities where polished rice is the staple diet. Norman's description was the first account of the condition in a temperate climate in the Western world and within a short period it was followed by similar accounts from other institutions around the world, including one from the state asylum in Little Rock, Arkansas. Norman's subsequent reports referred to these epidemics as well as to an obscure earlier account of an outbreak of beriberi in northern Japan. The condition is still found in Western countries particularly in malnourished alcoholics.<br>
<br>In the course of his regular visits to European centres of psychiatry Norman became aware of the tradition at Gheel, near Antwerp in Belgium, where the tradesmen and peasants cared for people with psychiatric disabilities in their own homes. Over 80 per cent of asylum patients were boarded out in this way at Gheel where they worked in the houses and fields. Norman became an advocate of this form of care which he claimed was more humane and which avoided the partial dementia which resulted from the institutionalization of patients. He also argued that it would be more cost effective. His efforts to introduce this enlightened approach in Dublin were frustrated by the authorities at the time.<br>
<br>On 6 June 1882 Norman married Mary Emily (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of Dr Randall Young Kenny of Killeshandra, co. Cavan. There were no children of the marriage. Norman had a deep interest in English literature and he was a keen student of French, German, and Italian. He was valued by his friends for his wisdom and integrity and for his humour. He collected art and old books and he was a practical botanist. In 1907 the honorary degree of MD was conferred on him by the University of Dublin. He died suddenly on 23 February 1908 while out walking in Dublin and was buried in the city's Mount Jerome cemetery. A memorial was erected by public subscription in the north aisle of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. It was unveiled by the lord lieutenant, the earl of Aberdeen, on St Luke's day, 18 October 1910. The Conolly Norman medal, presented annually to the best student in psychiatry in the final medical examinations in Trinity College, Dublin, commemorates his name.<br>
