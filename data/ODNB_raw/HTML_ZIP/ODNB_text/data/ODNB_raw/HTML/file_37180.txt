<span class="headword">Bennet,  John</span>  (1715&#150;1759), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher and Independent minister</span>, was born on 1 March 1715 in Whitehough, near Chinley, Derbyshire, the younger son of William Bennet (<i>c</i>.1677&#150;1766), farmer, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1752). Raised as a presbyterian, he was educated at a school in Chapel-en-le-Frith, where he acquired proficiency in Latin and Greek, intending to become a dissenting minister or attorney. However, after a short period in 1732 at the dissenting academy in Findern, Derbyshire, he became a justices' clerk in Sheffield until 1737, and then commenced work as a carrier between Sheffield and Macclesfield.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1742 Bennet experienced a religious conversion through the influence of David Taylor, an evangelical preacher formerly in the service of the family of Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon. From March 1743 he began to preach and built up a network of religious societies in Derbyshire, Cheshire, and south-east Lancashire, which soon became part of the Methodist organization led by John Wesley. As one of Wesley's leading preachers he attended the first Methodist conference in 1744, and in 1748 promoted the system of quarterly meetings to oversee the local Methodist circuits (groups of societies).<br>
<br>Relations with Wesley, however, became strained as a result of Bennet's marriage on 3 October 1749 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63480/', "Grace Murray (1715&#150;1803)")</script>, the widow of a Newcastle ship's captain and daughter of Robert Norman of Newcastle upon Tyne, since Wesley claimed that Grace was already contracted to marry himself. Bennet developed Calvinistic views and by the beginning of 1754 had broken with Wesley, followed by some of his societies, notably at Bolton. Bennet continued to be a travelling preacher, hoping at first to obtain aid from George Whitefield and his Calvinistic Methodist Connexion. Failing to achieve this, he was licensed as a dissenting preacher in January 1754, had a meeting-house built for him at Warburton in Cheshire, and on 9 November 1754 was ordained as an Independent minister. Although he also continued to preach elsewhere, ill health probably curtailed his activities.<br>
<br>Bennet was among the better educated of the early Methodist preachers and more sober than some in his attitude to supernatural phenomena. He was of a somewhat anxious and dependent temperament, especially when faced with persecution. He died in Chinley on 24 May 1759 and was buried in the presbyterian graveyard there. He left five sons, one of whom, William, became an Independent minister in London. His wife returned to Methodism later in life and died in Chapel-en-le-Frith on 23 February 1803.<br>
