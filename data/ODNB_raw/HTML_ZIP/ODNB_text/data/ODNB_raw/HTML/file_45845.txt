<span class="headword">Deverell,  Mary</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1805), <span class="occ">moral and religious writer</span>, was born probably at Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. She described herself as &#145;a person of obscure and undistinguished rank&#146;  (Deverell, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 3rd edn, iv) and may have come from a clothing family. She was possibly related to the family of John Deverell, esquire, of Clifton, who are listed as subscribers to her <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (1781). She was probably unmarried.<br>
<br>Deverell's <span class="italic">Sermons on the Following Subjects</span> (1774) was published in Bristol by the newspaper owner Sarah Farley. Anticipating criticism of her choice of subject, Deverell explained in her preface  (pp. iii&#150;v) that she would have changed the title but for the pleas of her subscribers. The list of these published in the first edition shows that she had strong support among the aristocracy and the Bristol clergy; they include the duke of Dorset and the earl of Coventry, and the rector of Minchinhampton, who subscribed for twenty volumes. The duchess of Queensberry and the marchioness of Rockingham subscribed to the second edition for four and eight copies respectively. The sermons dealt with moral issues in a conventional fashion.<br>
<br>Between the publication of the first and second editions of her sermons Deverell went to London and was present at Garrick's final performance, on 10 June 1776. She also found that the clergy &#145;approve of my writings &hellip; But the title of <span class="italic">Sermons</span> from a woman startles them! and must not be encouraged in our sex&#146;  (Deverell, <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, 1.110); however, she received permission to dedicate the third edition (1777) to Charlotte, princess royal. In London she may have met Samuel Johnson, who subscribed to her <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, along with his friend Dr William Adams, master of Pembroke College, Oxford. The <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, which was printed for the author, was a much more polemical work than the <span class="italic">Sermons</span> and contained trenchant criticism of the treatment of literary women. Deverell complained that &#145;the world in general have a very illiberal opinion of the conduct and manners of women who are deemed <i>learned</i>&#146;  (ibid., 1.228). She declared herself &#145;something of a rebel&#146; against the belief that &#145;the female sphere is domestic, and the practice of our duty in that province should be our highest ambition&#146;  (ibid., 1.43) and described a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage as &#145;the legal slave of a despotic sovereign&#146;  (ibid., 2.119&#150;20). She recognized that women were disadvantaged by exclusion from men's &#145;useful clubs and friendly associations&#146;  (ibid., 1.113), though she was able to use the public space of the pump rooms at Bath and the Bristol Hotwells to collect subscriptions.<br>
<br>Mary Deverell's career parallels that of Hannah More. Both were prot&eacute;g&eacute;es of the Bristol heiress Ann Lovell Gwatkin and both went to London about the same time (1774) to further their literary careers. The Mrs More in Bristol who is listed as subscriber to Deverell's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> may have been Hannah More's mother. However, More herself did not subscribe and referred to Deverell derisively as &#145;<i>parsoness</i> and <i>poetess</i>&#146;  (Roberts, 1.192). In 1782 she wrote from Bristol to Ann Kennicott, widow of Dr Benjamin Kennicott, following a visit from Deverell:<blockquote>I think I never saw her in such a fit of poetical phrenzy before, mad as the Cumoean maid, and bursting with the inspiring God, she repeated without stopping to take breath &hellip; <i>eighteen hundred lines</i>, being a Poem she has just finished, and to which she has modestly prefixed the title of <i>Epic</i>. (More MSS)</blockquote>This must be a reference to <span class="italic">Theodora and Dydimus</span> (1784), a heroic poem in three cantos in praise of female heroism. It was not well received. Her play, <span class="italic">Mary Queen of Scots</span> (1792), was apparently never performed.<br>
<br>Deverell's career demonstrates that, given the right connections, it was possible for a woman to establish a literary reputation. However, her writings show a strong awareness of the precariousness of the career of a literary woman. With the failure of her later works she lapsed into obscurity, though in 1797 she subscribed 5 guineas for the widows and orphans of the men killed at the naval battle of Camperdown. She died at Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, in September 1805, and was buried at Minchinhampton on 12 September.<br>
