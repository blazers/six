<span class="headword">Ballard,  Samuel James</span>  (1764?&#150;1829), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Samuel Ballard&#151;a subordinate officer in the navy, who had retired without promotion after the peace of 1763 and had engaged in business at Portsmouth&#151;and his wife, whose maiden name was Flint. Samuel James Ballard entered the navy in December 1776, under the patronage of John Leveson-Gower, then captain of the <i>Valiant</i> in the Grand Fleet under Admiral Keppel during the summer of 1778. In October 1779 he was transferred to the <i>Shrewsbury</i> (Captain Mark Robinson), and in her was present when Sir George Rodney defeated the Spanish fleet off Cape St Vincent, on 16 January 1780. In the following July the <i>Shrewsbury</i> rejoined Rodney's flag in the West Indies, was present off Martinique on 29 April 1781, and led the van in the strategic defeat off the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. On this fatal day the brunt of the fight fell on the <i>Shrewsbury</i>, of whose men fourteen were killed and fifty-two wounded, including Captain Robinson who lost a leg. The ship afterwards returned to the West Indies with Sir Samuel Hood, and was with him in the operations at St Kitts in January 1782, after which she had to be sent to Jamaica for repairs. On 10 February 1783, while still at Jamaica, Ballard was made a lieutenant by Admiral Rowley, and was actively employed in different ships during the ten years of peace. When war broke out again he was a lieutenant of the <i>Queen</i>, which carried Rear-Admiral Gardiner's flag through the last days of May and 1 June 1794. This great victory won for Ballard his commander's rank (5 July), and on 1 August 1795 he was further advanced to the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Early in 1796 Ballard was appointed to the frigate <i>Pearl</i>, and during the next two years was continuously and happily employed in convoying the trade for the Baltic or for Newfoundland and Quebec. In March 1798 he accompanied Commodore Cornwallis to the coast of Africa and to Barbados, from which station he returned in June of the following year. In October he carried out General Fox to Minorca, and remained attached to the Mediterranean Fleet for the next two years. The <i>Pearl</i> was paid off on 14 March 1802, after a commission of upwards of six years, during which time she had taken, destroyed, or recaptured about eighty vessels, privateers and merchantmen.<br>
<br>Captain Ballard then commanded a district of sea fencibles for more than seven years. It was not until October 1809 that he was appointed to the <i>Sceptre</i> (74 guns); he sailed shortly afterwards for the West Indies. Here he flew a commodore's broad pennant, and on 18 December 1809 commanded the squadron which captured the two heavily armed French frigates <i>Loire</i> and <i>Seine</i>, and destroyed the protecting batteries at Anse-la-Barque off Guadeloupe. At the capture of Guadeloupe in January and February 1810 he escorted one division of the army and commanded the naval brigade which, however, was not engaged. He returned to England with the <i>Sceptre</i> in the following September, and was for the next two years attached to the fleet in the channel and Bay of Biscay, but without being engaged in any active operations. His service at sea closed with the paying off of the <i>Sceptre</i> in January 1813, although in course of seniority he attained the rank of rear-admiral, on 4 June 1814, and of vice-admiral, on 27 May 1825.<br>
<br>Ballard married first his cousin Maria, only daughter of James Flint of Feversham; they had eight children of whom only a son and two daughters survived him. On 2 December 1822 he married Catharine, daughter of Sir Thomas Crawley Boevey, bt, of Flaxley Abbey, Gloucestershire. He resided for several years at Bath, and died at Exmouth on 11 October 1829.<br>
