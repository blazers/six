<span class="headword">Watt, Dame  Katherine Christie</span>  (1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">nurse and civil servant</span>, was born at 40 Victoria Road, Govanhill, Glasgow, on 31 August 1886, the second daughter of James Christie Watt, a master butcher, and his wife, Margaret Leper Semple. Little is known of her life until she began to train as a nurse at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, at the relatively late age of twenty-four. Having undertaken her general nurse training in Glasgow (1911&#150;16), she took her midwifery training at the Middlesex Hospital, London. During the latter training she joined the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service reserve and spent some time working in a field hospital in Flanders during the First World War. She joined the Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service (PMRAFNS) in 1919 and remained in that service until 1938. While there she had various postings in Britain and abroad, and in 1930 she was appointed to the Air Ministry as matron-in-chief. That post, which she held until 1938, brought her into contact with the civil service, beginning an association that she maintained for the rest of her working life.<br>
<br>In 1939 Katherine Watt was seconded to the Ministry of Health as principal matron of the civil nursing reserve. Initially she had two specific responsibilities: to advise on the nursing services that would be required to support the evacuation of mothers and children from the major cities, and to set up the civil nursing reserve for the emergency hospital service. Having fulfilled these two responsibilities, in 1941, when the problems of identifying an adequate supply of people with nursing qualifications and experience reached extreme proportions, the minister of health appointed her chief nursing officer of the newly created division to advise on nursing matters. She was then actively involved in discussions on the plans for the National Health Service (NHS), specifically in setting up inquiries that attempted to establish the size and composition of the workforce that would be required. She was also a key source of advice to the ministry as it attempted to resolve some of the problems associated with the recruitment and training of nurses, and of assistant nurses in particular. In addition she was the first nurse appointed to represent the minister of health on the General Nursing Council for England and Wales.<br>
<br>Watt held the post of chief nursing officer until 1948. She then held the title of chief nursing adviser for another two years and travelled to India, Australia, and New Zealand as the government's representative, advising these Commonwealth countries on Britain's new NHS and on the position of nursing within the service. After retiring in 1950, she continued to travel widely as an adviser on nursing services. She was a governor of St George's Hospital, London, and a member of the grants committee of the RAF Benevolent Fund and of the Nations Fund for Nurses. She was also involved with a number of voluntary organizations, the St John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross, and the Women's Voluntary Service. She received a number of honours for her nursing work: she was awarded the Royal Red Cross in 1930, was appointed CBE in 1935, was created a dame of the British empire in 1945, and was awarded the Florence Nightingale medal of the International Red Cross in 1949.<br>
<br>Katherine Watt was the first nurse to be appointed to a permanent post within the British civil service to advise on nursing matters. In the post of chief nursing officer she had a unique opportunity to contribute a nursing perspective to policy debates on the health-care services in time of war and to plans for the new services of the NHS, both of which were dependent on a trained nursing service. Although the major part of her career was with the PMRAFNS, it is the records of the Ministry of Health that provide the most helpful insights into the person of Katherine Watt. The records of the Cabinet Office pre-war discussions on the organization of nursing services suggest that, as the senior matron for the armed services, she may have been intimidated by the position in which she found herself; that hesitancy was not a feature of her career in the Ministry of Health. A small, quiet, but quite determined woman, Katherine Watt never married. She died in St George's Hospital, London, on 1 November 1963.<br>
