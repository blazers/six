<span class="headword">Kennedy,  William</span>  (1799&#150;1871), <span class="occ">diplomatist and writer</span>, was born in Scotland on 26 December 1799, the eldest of five sons and a daughter of an Ayrshire man who became a cotton manufacturer in Dublin and his wife, Ann Davis. Kennedy's parents died before he reached adulthood, and the Revd James Bridge, a Presbyterian minister who lived near Aughnacloy, co. Tyrone, was his guardian until Kennedy could take legal responsibility for his siblings. Kennedy attended Belfast Academical Institution, known as a training place for dissenting clergymen. His father's will stipulated that Kennedy could inherit only on becoming a clergyman and Kennedy accordingly undertook a theological course at Dr Lawson's Seminary, Selkirk. He returned to Aughnacloy and was licensed to preach on 17 December 1822, but left the ministry after a year.<br>
<br>By February 1824 Kennedy lived in Dublin, tiring of monotonous Aughnacloy. He supposedly set out for Greece to join Lord Byron, but there is no firm evidence of this. By 1826 Kennedy was established in Paisley, where he became a friend of William Motherwell. In this year he published his first work, <span class="italic">My Early Days</span>, a moralizing fictional piece for children, reprinted in 1828, 1835, and 1843. On 25 March 1826 Kennedy became editor of the <span class="italic">Paisley Advertiser</span>, a post he held until 17 May 1828. In 1827 he published his first verse collection, <span class="italic">Fitful Fancies</span>, and during 1828 he and Motherwell produced the <span class="italic">Paisley Magazine</span>. Kennedy then moved to London, resolved on becoming an English lawyer. A letter (12 August 1828) reports that &#145;there are two highly satisfactory things here&#151;constant employment and good pay&#146;  (Marshall, 18). By October he had become a student of the Inner Temple, simultaneously working for the <span class="italic">Morning Journal</span> at 5 guineas a week. The short-lived <span class="italic">Englishman's Magazine</span> was undertaken with Leitch Ritchie [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23678/', "Ritchie, (Duncan) Leitch")</script>] in 1831. Kennedy also contributed to several annuals, and published a second verse collection, <span class="italic">The Arrow and the Rose</span> (1830), and another fictional work, <span class="italic">An Only Son</span> (1831).<br>
<br>Kennedy's historical drama, <span class="italic">The Siege of Antwerp</span> (1838), was dedicated to the earl of Durham, a whig, who was appointed governor-in-chief of British North America in March 1838. Durham, who had known Kennedy since 1833, appointed him commissioner for inquiring into the municipal institutions of Lower Canada. At some time between 1831 and 1838 Kennedy worked in Hull, where he met his wife, whose identity is unknown. According to family tradition she was socially unacceptable. There were no children. Kennedy's attachment to his wife is recorded in a poem, &#145;Alla mia sposa&#146;, written on board a New York packet on 25 December 1841:<blockquote>
<div>And where thou art, the dreariest spot<br>
</div>
<div>Is home, sweet home to me.<br>
</div> (Marshall, 53)</blockquote>After Durham's retirement, late in 1838, Kennedy travelled to America, spending some months in Texas, and after his return to England in 1839 he supported the cause of Texas in debates about its independence. In 1841 he published a two-volume work entitled <span class="italic">The Rise, Progress and Prospects of the Republic of Texas</span>. He offered his services to Lord Aberdeen at the Foreign Office, and visited Texas again, claiming responsibility for the ratification of the slave trade treaty. Kennedy's popularity in Texas is reflected in his appointment as its consul-general in London, soon after his return in the spring of 1842. He resigned when he was offered the post of British consul to Galveston, Texas, in September 1842. Kennedy returned to England in 1847, suffering bad health. He visited Glasgow, undertaking the editorship of the third edition of Motherwell's poems. In 1849 he retired on a government pension, living first in London, then Paris. He became ill again in Paris, and was a patient in the Maison de Sant&eacute; at Neuilly. He died there in the spring of 1871. He was buried in Paris, but his sister moved his remains to Caen in Normandy. Kennedy's verse was largely of the &#145;gift book&#146; genre, though a few pieces reflect a more personal involvement, such as his poem &#145;I love the land&#146;. He is perhaps more entitled to be remembered as a diplomat than a poet.<br>
