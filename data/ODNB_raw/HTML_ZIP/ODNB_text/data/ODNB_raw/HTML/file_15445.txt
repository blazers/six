<span class="headword">Ker,  Andrew, of Cessford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1526), <span class="occ">border chieftain</span>, succeeded his grandfather, Walter Ker of Caverton, as a minor in 1501. His father, Sir Robert Ker of Caverton, a courtier who became warden of the Scottish middle march, was killed by John Heron of Crawley at a border &#145;day of truce&#146; about 1500. His mother was Christian Rutherford. Andrew Ker was of lawful age to be served heir to his grandfather in 1511. He fought at the battle of Flodden (1513) and became warden of the middle march on 10 August 1515 for a yearly fee of &pound;100 Scots. Also known from his Christian name as Dand, he swore the oath of wardenship promising to keep good rule in the borders. Following in his father's footsteps, he became a cupbearer to James V at a fee of 20 merks per annum with livery. After 21 September 1507 Ker married Agnes, daughter of Sir Patrick Crichton of Cranstoun Riddel, who had been granted the rights to his marriage by the crown in return for &pound;466 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Scots. Agnes was the widow of George Sinclair, son and heir of Sir Oliver Sinclair of Roslin, who died about 1507. On 20 February 1509 the lands of Auld Roxburgh were confirmed to her in liferent. With Ker she had at least three sons and two daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15461/', "Mark Ker")</script>, later commendator of Newbattle Abbey.<br>
<br>Cessford was never very far from the tangled politics surrounding the minority of James V. In 1514 he supported the return of the duke of Albany as governor of Scotland, and after the downfall of the third Lord Hume in 1515 Albany rewarded Cessford with the wardenship of the middle march and informed the English warden, Thomas, Lord Dacre, that Cessford was a &#145;man of gude&#146; who would not avenge his father's murder  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 2/1, no. 808). Ker was to have been warden of the east march as well, but he refused this as he did not want to &#145;meddle with the East Marches&#146;  (ibid., 870). As warden Ker became the target of English raiders; Lord Dacre regarded him as forgetful and rash, and Cessford Castle was attacked by English soldiers during Anglo-Scottish fighting in 1519. Ker remained in office, however, and was even made a commissioner to treat for an Anglo-Scottish truce in January 1521. The negotiations proved futile as full-scale war broke out in 1523.<br>
<br>By remaining an ally of Albany Cessford incurred the wrath of James V's uncle Henry VIII, leading to the siege of Cessford Castle by Dacre on 21 May 1523, which led to casualties on both sides. Had Cessford not &#145;surrendered the place on being allowed to depart with bag and baggage&#146; it is doubtful if the English would have taken it as &#145;the wall was 14 feet thick&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3/2, no. 3039). Cessford's revenge came in July 1524, when 2000 Scots repulsed 1000 English raiders at Smailholm in the Scottish middle march. Although hurt himself, Cessford would have been pleased that his father's murderer, the &#145;bastard Heron&#146;, was killed. Cessford was subsequently warded for disrupting the administration of border justice and for feuding with Scott of Buccleuch. He then allegedly changed his allegiance to England, and was dismissed from his wardenship during March 1525 in favour of Queen Margaret's second husband, the sixth earl of Angus. He nevertheless promised to serve as a deputy to Angus and advise him on border matters.<br>
<br>Cessford's term of office had not been helped by his cousins the Kers of Ferniehirst, who often refused to obey him as warden of the middle march, despite proclamations ordering them to do so. His alliance with Angus exacerbated his difficulties with the Kers of Ferniehirst over the lordship of Jedforest, which had begun before 1520. By 1526 Cessford was supporting Angus against the powerful earl of Arran, whom Sir Andrew Ker of Ferniehirst defended. These two main branches of the Ker kindred could temporarily reconcile their differences to oppose other factions, as when in July 1526 they joined forces to defend the young James V against a threat of kidnap by their territorial rival, Walter Scott of Buccleuch, who had sided with a faction wishing to liberate the king from the control of the Douglases. Ironically it was this action, rather than any internecine border feud, that led to Ker's death at Darnick Moor on 24 July 1526.<br>
<br>Cessford's killer was not Buccleuch, as alleged in some sources, but one of his Elliot servants. Buccleuch was blamed, however, and did not receive a pardon until September 1528. The Ker and Scott families persevered in a blood feud for much of the sixteenth century. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15459/', "Walter Ker")</script>, who was still a minor, succeeded his father and was rewarded by a grateful James V with his family's now-customary office of cupbearer to the king. The Cessford estates and the rights to Walter's marriage were granted to the safekeeping of the latter's uncle, George Ker of Faldonside.<br>
