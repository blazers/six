<span class="headword">Pierce,  Kate Edith</span>  (1873&#150;1966), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born at Green Lane Terrace, Kettering, Northamptonshire, on 30 November 1873, the elder of two daughters of Edward Pierce, attorney's clerk, and his wife, Emma Norah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mawby. After attending South College, a private school in Kettering, she became a pupil teacher, before her initial training in librarianship early in 1896. Neither library schools nor professional qualifications had been established at that time, and her informal apprenticeship took the form of several months spent at Clerkenwell public library under the instruction of James Duff Brown whom she described as &#145;inspire[ing] me with enthusiasm&#146;  (Pierce, reminiscences). Duff Brown had pioneered open access to the library stock at Clerkenwell, where borrowers might help themselves to books rather than requesting them from a librarian.<br>
<br>Later in 1896 Kettering urban council's library committee appointed Pierce chief public librarian for the town, making her one of 17 women employed as chief librarians among the 240 or so English library authorities. The influence of her training was clear from the outset; with Duff Brown as consultant, she set up Kettering's first public library as an open access library, in a room in Corn Market Hall.<br>
<br>Increasing use led to a change of premises in Kettering, first to Silver Street in 1901, and again in 1904 to the Sheep Street library, one of the first buildings designed as an open access library, and organized on the &#145;radiating stack system&#146;. The new library was supported by an &pound;8000 Carnegie Trust donation. Andrew Carnegie attended the opening. In 1913 Pierce also took on the role of honorary curator of Kettering's Alfred East Art Gallery.<br>
<br>Pierce's early career was spent enlarging and establishing Kettering as a model public library service, much visited and admired by others in the profession which was moving towards general implementation of open access. In 1914 Pierce became one of the few women to achieve FLA (Fellow of the Library Association) status. This was the most senior library qualification, and had been newly established by the Library Association to replace the <i>ad hoc</i> examinations organized by individual library authorities.<br>
<br>Particularly during the pre-First World War era, when complaints about &#145;sex antagonism&#146; appeared in professional library journals, Pierce was an outspoken advocate of women's rights to pursue librarianship on equal terms with men. During lively exchanges in the <span class="italic">Library World</span> journal in 1902&#150;3 and again in 1907, Pierce put up a combative response to suggestions that women were inadequate workers who would diminish the profession. She argued that women not only had a right to such work, but also that they could, as she herself was doing, hold the most senior posts. Her professional correspondence, however, shows a keen awareness that this would not amount to equal pay. Her entry on librarianship in <span class="italic">A guide to the professions and occupations of educated women and girls</span> (n.d.), published by the Central Bureau for the Employment of Women, emphasized the need to obtain relevant qualifications.<br>
<br>Pierce's standing in the library profession was reflected in her tenure of many senior posts in professional bodies. In 1913 she was elected vice-president of the North Midlands Library Association (NMLA) and the following year became president. In 1915, following nomination as a candidate by women librarians, she was the first woman to be elected to the Library Association (LA) council. This coincided with the moment when women began to dominate numerically in the profession. She was re-elected to her post many times until 1937. Pierce also held other LA posts including chairman of the Hospital Libraries Committee. Pierce was president of the NMLA once more between 1932 and 1934, overseeing the amalgamation of the regional association with the national LA.<br>
<br>More negotiations with the Carnegie Trust took place in the mid-1930s when Pierce headed a committee which eventually created the East Midlands Regional Library Bureau, set up to enable inter-library lending. The bureau began work in 1935 with Pierce as chairman of the executive committee.<br>
<br>Outside librarianship, Pierce was a skilled dressmaker and co-founder and chairman of Kettering badminton society. After an episode of ill health, in 1939 she retired after over four decades as Kettering's chief librarian. She moved to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where she died at her home, 11 and 13 Park Road, on 27 March 1966. Her funeral was held in Tunbridge Wells and she was cremated there on 1 April. She left a bequest to the Library Association of &pound;2200. This funds the Kate Pierce international award which is used to assist librarians pursuing international activities which further the interests of librarianship. Her own forthright pursuit of the aim of modernizing librarianship, and her articulate defence of equal status for women within the profession, resound from the pages of the early library press.<br>
