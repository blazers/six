<span class="headword">Page, Sir  Frederick  Handley</span>  (1885&#150;1962), <span class="occ">aircraft designer and manufacturer</span>, was born on 15 November 1885 at 141 Cranham Villa, Cheltenham, the second child in a family of four sons and one daughter of Frederick Joseph Page, master upholsterer and an active member of the Plymouth Brethren sect, and his wife, Eliza Ann Handley. He was educated at Cheltenham grammar school until 1902 and at Finsbury Technical College for a three-year course in electrical engineering under Professor Silvanus Thompson. In 1906 he was appointed chief electrical designer at the engineering firm of Johnson and Phillips Ltd at Charlton. He joined the Aeronautical Society in 1907, and helped Jos&eacute; Weiss to construct an automatically stable aeroplane.<br>
<br>In 1908 Handley Page was dismissed by his employers, who were displeased with his aviation experiments on their premises. He set up in business himself, determined to construct aeroplanes. He was not a wealthy man or a skilful pilot but in 1909 he moved to Barking, where he established Handley Page Ltd, the first British company registered specifically to manufacture aeroplanes. To earn extra money he did some evening teaching at Finsbury Technical College and then, in 1911, joined the Northampton Polytechnic Institute (later Northampton Engineering College and then the City University) at Clerkenwell as lecturer in aeronautics under Dr Mullineux Walmsley. He installed there a wind tunnel, thereby combining practical course work with investigation of design problems at Barking. His first passenger-carrying monoplane flew across London in July 1911, and the following year another two-seater competed in military trials on Salisbury Plain. In 1913 he moved to Cricklewood and his first biplane was demonstrated at Hendon during the following year. When Murray Sueter at the Admiralty demanded a &#145;bloody paralyser&#146; to halt the German advance into Belgium, Handley Page produced a large twin-engined bomber for the Royal Naval Air Service, followed in 1918 by a still larger four-engined machine to bomb Berlin, one of each type being the first aeroplanes to fly from England to India. By the end of the war the name Handley Page had become identified with big bombers. Handley Page was appointed CBE in 1918, and in May of that year he married Una Helen (<i>d</i>. 1957), daughter of John Robert Thynne at St George's, Hanover Square, London; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1919 Handley Page Transport Ltd was founded to promote a civil air service to the continent. This company, with three others, formed Imperial Airways in 1924. The aircraft manufacturing side of the business incurred massive losses and for a while Handley Page lost control of his company which was run, until 1924, by a chairman appointed by his creditors. From 1924 until rearmament began in 1936 Handley Page Ltd was not very profitable. Graceful airliners were produced for Imperial Airways, but orders were too few to guarantee large profits. It was fortunate that Handley Page had, in 1919, patented the slotted wing which, when fitted to the leading edge of a wing, reduced the danger of stalling. When the patent expired in 1938 the company had earned &pound;750,000 from worldwide sales. Frederick Handley Page himself also gained financially from his invention, receiving &pound;100,000 from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. Handley Page employed an excellent design staff which included George Volkert and Gustav Lachmann, who had independently discovered the slot principle in 1918. Before the war the company moved its headquarters to Radlett, Hertfordshire, where the Halifax bomber was produced. Handley Page was knighted in 1942 for his contribution to the war effort. He produced the first post-war civil airliner, the Hermes, and later the Victor bomber but by the 1950s the viability of the small independent aircraft producer was under serious threat. Handley Page refused to yield to government pressure to merge with other firms in the industry, and at his death in 1962 his company was the only remaining major independent aircraft manufacturer.<br>
<br>A pioneer of technological education, Handley Page initiated sandwich courses for his apprentices in 1923, in conjunction with Northampton Engineering College. He was elected a fellow of the City and Guilds of London Institute in 1939, and became chairman of its council and executive committee ten years later. In 1946 he was instrumental, with Sir Roy Fedden, in setting up the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield at the behest of Sir Stafford Cripps, and remained chairman of its governing body until his death. An autocrat intolerant of governmental interference, he refused to merge his company with other groups under the plan proposed by the minister of defence, Duncan Sandys, because he insisted on protecting his dedicated team of employees, whose loyalty he had earned and esteemed highly. He was a founding member of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors in 1916, was twice its chairman and, in 1938&#150;9, its first president, and was also vice-chairman of the Air Registration Board, president of the Institute of Transport (1945&#150;6) and of the Royal Aeronautical Society (1945&#150;7), master of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers (1943&#150;4), and deputy lieutenant (1954&#150;6) and lieutenant (1956&#150;60) of Middlesex. In debate a master of repartee, well spiced with quotations from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Gibbon, he was always abreast of current technology and objective in criticism.<br>
<br>The Royal Aeronautical Society awarded Handley Page its gold medal in 1960, and in the same year he received the Royal Society of Arts Albert gold medal and the German Scientific Society for Aviation's Ludwig Prandtl ring. He was an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and of the order of the Crown (Belgium). This latter honour he received personally from King Albert for saving two bathers at Blankenberge from drowning. The annual Handley Page memorial lecture, first given in May 1963 by Prince Philip, duke of Edinburgh, is sponsored jointly by the Cranfield Society and the Royal Aeronautical Society. Handley Page died at his home, 18 Grosvenor Square, London, on 21 April 1962.<br>
