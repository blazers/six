<span class="headword">Pickworth,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1673&#150;<em>c.</em>1738), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born in New Sleaford, Lincolnshire, the son of Henry Pickworth, a farmer of New Sleaford, and his wife, Sarah Everitt. He entered into business as a tanner and joined the Quakers, becoming an elder and overseer of the local monthly meeting. On 28 March 1696 he married Winifred (1674&#150;1752), daughter of John Whitchurch of Warwick Lane, London; they had five sons, all born at Sleaford. A staunch defender of Quaker beliefs and principles, Pickworth challenged Francis Bugg, one of the bitterest and most persistent of opponents of Quakerism, to an open debate at Sleaford. In the debate, held on 25 August 1701, Pickworth proved no match for his adversary, an experienced and skilful debater, although both parties to the dispute claimed victory and published their versions of the proceedings, Pickworth's <span class="italic">A narrative of a charge against Francis Bugg and his evasions and shufflings at Sleaford in Lincs</span>. (1701) being answered by Bugg's <span class="italic">A Brief Answer to the Quaker Narrative Written by Henry Pickworth of Sleaford</span> (1701).<br>
<br>Within a few years Pickworth had become an open and bitter opponent of Quakers. The reasons for this <i>volte face</i> are not entirely clear but Joseph Smith was probably near the truth when he wrote that Pickworth &#145;got so entangled in [Bugg's] net that he was unable to extricate himself&#146;  (Smith, 2.416). Pickworth was also clearly familiar with, and influenced by, the writings of other opponents of the Quakers such as Charles Leslie, Thomas Crisp, and George Keith. His first published attack on the Society of Friends was <span class="italic">An Open Letter to the Friends' Yearly Meeting Attacking Quakerism</span> (1713), and during the following twenty-five years there followed a stream of malicious material denouncing what he considered to be the anti-Christian doctrines, false prophecies, and seditious practices of the Quakers. His strongest piece of invective, published shortly after his expulsion from the society in 1714, was <span class="italic">A Charge of Error, Heresy etc. &hellip; Against the Most Noted Leaders of the Quakers</span> (1716), in which he claimed that William Penn had been a papist and had died insane. In 1732 there appeared his <span class="italic">Narrative to the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry</span>, outlining what he considered to be Penn's and Richard Claridge's acknowledgement of gross errors in Quaker beliefs. This drew a response from Joseph Besse entitled <span class="italic">A Cloud of Witnesses</span> (1732), to which Pickworth replied with <span class="italic">A Defence from one Besse</span> (1734), in which he repeated his accusations about Penn. His last known publication was <span class="italic">Vindication of a former defence of a certain narrative presented to the bishop of Lichfield and Coventry</span> (1738).<br>
<br>In his published works Pickworth may not have demonstrated the same quality of writing and argument as Charles Leslie and George Keith, nor the same sustained venom as Francis Bugg, but his inside knowledge of the Society of Friends made him an adversary who could not be ignored. He died at King's Lynn, Norfolk, in or about 1738.<br>
