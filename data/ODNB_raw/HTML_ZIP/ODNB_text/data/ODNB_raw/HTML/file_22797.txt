<span class="headword">Primrose,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was the second son of Archibald Primrose, of Culross, Perthshire, a law agent, and Margaret Bleau, of Castlehill. Nothing is known of his early life. He was appointed clerk to the privy council of Scotland for life on 1 February 1599. He was twice married: his first marriage was to Sibylla Miller, with whom he had a son, Gilbert, and six daughters; by 1616 he had married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of Richard Lawson of Boghall, Lanarkshire, with whom he had a son, Archibald [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22793/', "Primrose, Sir Archibald, Lord Carrington (1616&#150;1679)")</script>], and six daughters.<br>
<br>On 13 June 1616 Primrose was granted a monopoly of printing and selling the catechism entitled <span class="italic">God and the King</span>, a work that emphasized the supremacy of royal prerogative over the kirk. James VI intended that it should supplant John Craig's <span class="italic">Examination before the Communione</span>, which had served as the &#145;official&#146; catechism of the kirk since 1592. In entrusting the monopoly to Primrose, the king sought to employ the authority of the privy council to enforce its use in schools, universities, and kirks, and to disseminate a copy in every household in Scotland. Presbyterian opponents of royal policy, however, were quick to broadcast that the new &#145;catechisme&#146; contained &#145;little of God and much for the king&#146;  (NL Scot., Calderwood, &#145;Ane answere&#146;, fol. 49<i>r</i>). Thus the work was never widely popular, and Primrose appears to have made little effort regarding recovery of payment and distribution of stock following the king's death in 1625.<br>
<br>Although Primrose courted royal favour, he and his wife were not unsympathetic to the plight of presbyterianism in Scotland. In 1617 Primrose drew up the <span class="roman">Act of Caution</span> by which the nonconformist minister David Calderwood was released from &#145;ward&#146; pending his appeal against the sentence of banishment. Subsequently, Calderwood received a letter, &#145;penned by James Primrois &hellip; informing me that [meanwhile] it was his majesties will that I should forbear to preach&#146;, which clause had been omitted from the act. Primrose, noted the minister, beseeched him &#145;to bewarr that I involve myself not in a new trouble&#146;  (Calderwood, &#145;A trew relatioun&#146;, fols. 5<i>v</i>&#150;6<i>r</i>). Catherine Lawson (a prominent presbyterian matron) shared her husband's concern for Calderwood, and was entrusted with the care of &#145;twa kist full of [the minister's] books&#146; during his enforced exile  (Wells, 132). The discovery of such material in the house of a trusted servant of the crown would almost certainly have led to Primrose's dismissal.<br>
<br>Almost nothing is recorded of Primrose's private activities during the reign of Charles I. He was a man of moderate means, leaving possessions worth &pound;700 Scots to his second wife, Catherine, who died in 1651. Primrose continued as a trusted servant of the crown until his death at Edinburgh, on 21 January 1640, of causes unknown.<br>
