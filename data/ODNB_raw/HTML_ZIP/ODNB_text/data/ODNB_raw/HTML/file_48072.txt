<span class="headword">Morson,  Thomas</span>  (1825&#150;1908), <span class="occ">pharmaceutical manufacturer</span>, born in London, was the son of <a name="cosubject_39362"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Newborn Robert Morson</span>  (1800&#150;1874), <span class="occ">pharmaceutical manufacturer</span>, born in Stratford-le-Bow, London, who served his apprenticeship with an apothecary in the Fleet Market before studying alkaloid chemistry in Paris. When the elder Morson returned to London in 1821 he established himself as a retail pharmacist in Southampton Row, Bloomsbury, and soon acquired a leading position in the import and supply of quinine and morphia. By 1837 demand for his range of products&#151;which included perfumes and dyes as well as pharmaceuticals and their ingredients&#151;was growing, and, like other pharmacists, he found that the back of the shop was inadequate for manufacturing; he set up a separate factory in Hornsey Road. In 1869 the factory was moved further out of London, to the Summerfields works, Ponder's End, in Middlesex. The elder Morson was a founder member of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical societies; he was a member of the Pharmaceutical Society's council, serving as vice-president and president. He died at his house, 38 Queen Square, Bloomsbury, on 3 March 1874.<br>
<br>Thomas Morson was educated at University College School and then studied pharmacy in France before joining his father's business. In 1857 he married the daughter of a Boulogne pharmacist, whose family name was Dagomet. There were two sons of the marriage, Thomas Pierre and Albert Robert. When his father died in 1874, Morson took over the running of the business. He employed the chemist Robert Taubman to run the laboratory the Morsons had by then established, and from 1891 until his death in 1905 Taubman was also a partner in the business.<br>
<br>The Morsons enjoyed a high reputation and a number of leading medical scientists, including Joseph Lister (1827&#150;1912), consulted the firm. This led to the development and marketing of Lister's cyanide and other named products, but, despite its standing, the Morson business and laboratory, like others in Britain at that time, did not engage in speculative research and development leading to innovation of the kind that was taking place in the industry in Germany in the 1890s and the first decade of the twentieth century. The pharmacy in Southampton Row was closed in 1900 and new offices and warehouses were opened in Elm Street, Gray's Inn Road.<br>
<br>Morson was essentially a private rather than a public person, with artistic interests and friends, and he built up a collection of contemporary paintings. Like his father his interest in science reached beyond pharmacy and he was a member of the Geological and Zoological societies. He died at his home, 30 Elsworthy Road, Primrose Hill, London, on 5 February 1908.<br>
<br>The business was inherited by his sons who converted it in 1915 into a private limited company. It was later acquired by the American pharmaceutical company, Mercke, Sharp, and Dohme.<br>
