<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vansittart,  Henry</span>  (1732&#150;1770?), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, born on 3 June 1732 at his father's house in Ormond Street, London, was the third son of Arthur van Sittart (1692&#150;1760) of Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, and his wife, Martha, who was the eldest daughter and coheir of Sir John Stonhouse of Radley, who had been comptroller of Queen Anne's household. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28106/', "Robert Vansittart")</script> was his elder brother, and George, his younger brother, who also served in Bengal, was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28102/', "General George Henry Vansittart")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28104/', "Vice-Admiral Henry Vansittart")</script>. It was this generation that began spelling the name as a single word. Merchants and traders, the family traced its origin to Siddard, a town in the province of Limburg in the Netherlands, but Henry's ancestors had moved to Julich and eventually to Danzig, and from there his grandfather Peter van Sittart went to London about 1670. Having made a fortune in trading with Russia, India, and the south seas, he became a governor of the Russia Company and a director of the East India Company. His son Arthur, Henry's father, was also involved in both of the trading companies, from which he made a large fortune. By then the family were living in Reading, where Henry probably attended the grammar school before going to Winchester College.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>In 1745 Vansittart was given an appointment by the East India Company as a writer at their establishment at Fort St David, Madras. Some accounts have suggested, without giving any details, that he was sent to India at thirteen by his father to get him out of England since he was a dissolute and unruly youth  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), but a writer was, in effect, an apprentice who copied letters and other documents under the direction of more senior officials, and not until 1751 was sixteen made the minimum age for such appointments in the company's service. They were sought after as an opportunity to make money, especially by families like the van Sittarts, with a long connection to the East India Company. When Vansittart arrived at Fort St David to begin his career as a writer, it was a subsidiary establishment of Fort St George, about 50 miles to the north, the company's headquarters in south India. It was close to Pondicherry, and when the rival French trading company the Compagnie des Indes Orientales attacked Fort St David in 1746&#150;7, he took part in its successful defence. He also began the study of Persian, which was the formal language of communication with Mughal officials, and while English writers praised his skill, a Frenchman said no Indian could understand him  (Woodruff, 1.116), which would not preclude a good reading knowledge. Robert Clive was another recently arrived young company servant at Fort St David, and he and Vansittart began a close friendship, although later they became opponents when the company was involved in party struggles in England. In 1749 Fort St George was captured by the French, and Fort St David became the seat of the company's government in the Madras region until 1752, when it was returned to Fort St George. The move to Fort St David probably helped Vansittart's advancement, for in 1750 he was promoted to the grade of factor, or agent responsible for the sale and purchase of the company's goods in his area. At this time the company's servants were essentially private traders licensed by the company, not full-time civilian employees as was later the case. While serving its commercial needs, their positions gave servants the opportunity for political involvement, which, combined with the right to trade on their own account, and through deals of various kinds with Indian rulers and merchants, made it possible for even a young man like Vansittart to amass a considerable fortune very quickly. Although no exact details are known, he had made enough in five or six years to return to England from Madras in 1751.<br>
<br>Vansittart now enjoyed the pleasures of an eighteenth-century rake, if contemporary accounts are true, for he became a member, along with his two brothers Arthur and Robert, of Sir Francis Dashwood's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71306', "Franciscans")</script> or Monks of Medmenham whose members were said to engage in parodies of the mass, sexual orgies, and political conspiracies. Vansittart had his portrait painted by William Hogarth in 1753 dressed as a monk, and was said to have brought a baboon from India, which he had dressed as a chaplain for the club. In addition to these pastimes Vansittart apparently gambled heavily and lost much of his money before returning to Fort St George in 1753.<br>
<br>While England and France were at peace, the French and English trading companies in India were engaged in local wars, and at the end of 1753 Dupleix, the great French commander in India, agreed to discuss peace. Vansittart was one of the two East India Company commissaries who met the French at Sadras during 21&#150;6 January 1754, and, while the negotiations failed, the senior officials were impressed by Vansittart's skill. He became a junior merchant and then in 1756 a senior merchant, giving him more authority and more opportunities for private trade. He also became secretary, as well as Persian translator, to the secret committee, which consisted of the governor and four other members of his council and dealt with Indian rulers. In the following year he became a member of the council itself and &#145;searcher of the sea-gate&#146;, a position of profit and responsibility.<br>
<br>An important concern of the council and secret committee at the time was the company's relationship to the most powerful ruler in the region, the nawab of Arcot. While the commander of the company's armies in 1754 proposed deposing him and taking over his territories, the council hesitated, on the grounds that the company lacked experience to manage such a large territory. A similar situation was to face Vansittart a few years later in Bengal, with even more momentous consequences. Another major concern of the council was prompted by the outbreak of war between France and Britain in 1756, when Madras was attacked in February 1759 by the comte de Lally, the commandant of all the French possessions in India. Vansittart became acting governor while the French were besieging Fort St George.<br>
<br>Contemporary accounts give little information about Vansittart's private life, but whatever his youthful indiscretions, after his return to Madras he appears to have become a respectable family man. On 1 June 1754 he married Emilia Morse (<i>d</i>. 1819), daughter of Nicolas Morse, the governor of Madras. They had two daughters, Emilia and Sophie, and five sons, Henry, Arthur, Robert, George, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28105/', "Nicholas Vansittart")</script>.<h2>
<a name="GovernorofBengal"></a>Governor of Bengal</h2>Robert Clive, now governor of Bengal, planned to return to England. He urged Laurence Sulivan, one of the most powerful figures in the company in London, to bring Vansittart from Madras to Bengal as governor as the best hope for maintaining the company's position there. Vansittart was appointed governor of Bengal by the company on 8 November 1759, but he did not arrive in Calcutta until July 1760, after the French threat to Madras had lessened. The language of the appointment letter&#151;as president of the council and governor of Fort William and the company's settlements in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa&#151;sounds impressive, but the power and prestige with which the title resonates comes from a later time. Decisions were made by majority vote, and the majority of Vansittart's council were from the beginning opposed to him, partly as an outsider from Madras who, in their view, had usurped a place that by right of seniority belonged to them. However, the councils protests went unheeded as the directors supported Vansittart. The acting governor, John Zephaniah Holwell, felt especially aggrieved, but Vansittart in general accepted the plans he had made for dealing with the most pressing problem, relations with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63554/', "Mir Jafar Ali Khan")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63552/', "Bengal, nawabs of")</script>], the nawab of Bengal, and he afterwards defended Vansittart when he was attacked by his enemies in London.<br>
<br>Vansittart arrived in Bengal to find not only a hostile council, but, as he put it, &#145;the treasury was so low, and our resources so much drained, that we were obliged to put an entire stop to our investment [the goods that were purchased to be exported to Europe] and it was with the utmost difficulty the current expenses of the settlement could be provided for&#146;  (Vansittart, 1.14). His explanation for this situation, a few years after Clive had seemed to deliver the wealth of Bengal to the company, centred on the treaty that had been made with Mir Jafar to overthrow the nawab of Bengal and give the throne to him. By the treaty the company was to raise an army, which would be under its complete control but paid for by the nawab and at his service when required. The nawab had failed to provide the promised money, and Vansittart was faced with a mutinous army that had not been paid for months. The nawab was losing control of his own administration and, so far from being able to pay the arrears, asked Vansittart for loans. To add to his difficulties, no money had been sent from London, as the directors had assumed that the money from the nawab would pay for the investment and, in addition, Madras and Bombay had been told that they would have to depend on Bengal for their needs. From his recent experience he knew how much Madras needed supplies because of the war with the French for the control of the Carnatic, which, he pointed out, was &#145;an interesting object for the English nation&#146; but a very expensive one for the company. Since there was no hope of getting money directly from the nawab, he soon concluded that the only solution was to get him to cede outright large territories to the company, from which it could collect the taxes. When Vansittart went to see him in October 1760, it became clear that the nawab was willing to see himself and his state ruined rather than put &#145;more power and more resources of money in our hands&#146;  (ibid., 1.15). Vansittart was convinced that the only course of action left open, if he was to save the company's foothold in Bengal, was the overthrow of Mir Jafar in favour of his son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63555/', "Mir Kasim")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63552/', "Bengal, nawabs of")</script>], who, quite apart from the company, was already intriguing against him. Vansittart tried to save the nawab's reputation by suggesting that he could retain his title, with Mir Kasim as his deputy. However, he refused this offer, and turned over all power to Mir Kasim and went to live in Calcutta. Mir Kasim had already signed a treaty on 27 September 1760 giving the company what Vansittart wanted: full control of the three rich districts of Burdwan, Midnapore, and Chittagong. Often spoken of as a creature of Vansittart and the British, it is probable that Mir Kasim would have overthrown the nawab without their intrusion and without the costs that accrued from Vansittart's arrangement.<br>
<br>Vansittart always referred in his writings to these events as &#145;the revolution&#146;, and believed that people were in general pleased with it, as evidenced by the fact that there had been no resistance, and &#145;not a drop of blood spilt&#146;  (Vansittart, 1.53). When the directors heard what had happened, they were also pleased; they told the council in Calcutta that they realized the revolution was principally due to Vansittart and &#145;returned him thanks for his great services&#146;  (ibid., 2.177). Warren Hastings was an active participant in bringing about the changes, and he remained Vansittart's most loyal supporter in the council and among the senior officials in charge of the company's factories. Almost immediately challenges to Vansittart's authority came from these officials, especially those at Patna.<br>
<br>Patna, one of the most important inland posts, became the focus of Vansittart's troubles when the company's military officers there, Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre Coote and Major John Carnac, supported Ramnarian, the deputy governor of the region appointed by the previous nawab, in his refusal to submit his accounts to Mir Kasim. Their stand contravened the orders of Vansittart, who was anxious to remain on good terms with the nawab. Coote and Carnac continued to defy him and insulted the nawab, so Vansittart recalled them, leaving Ramnarian at the mercy of Mir Kasim, who had him put to death. This led to the charge then and later that Vansittart had sacrificed a friend of the British in order to placate and strengthen the nawab, instead of weakening him, which would have been in the company's interest.<br>
<br>The most serious dispute involving Vansittart, the nawab, the company's servants, and London developed over the private inland trade of the company's servants. The company itself had been free from paying duties on goods they were exporting through the use of permits, or <i>dastaks</i>, granted to them by the Mughal authorities. After the battle of Plassey the private merchants began to use them for internal as well as external trade. Furthermore, the British traders employed Indian agents, <i>gomastahs</i>, who oppressed the Indian merchants by forcing them to sell goods at low prices. Mir Kasim realized that this misuse of the permits was depriving him of duties as well as ruining the local traders, and that the company's agents, both British and Indian, were setting up what amounted to their own system of law and order. He appealed to Vansittart to put a stop to what in 1758 the directors in London had called the &#145;scandalous prostitution&#146; of the permits, and Vansittart saw the justice of the nawab's complaints. Along with Hastings he went to negotiate with the nawab at his capital, and they reached what seemed to him a fair settlement: the company's servants could participate in the inland trade on the payment of a 9 per cent duty, which was much less than Indian traders paid. However, when Vansittart reported this settlement early in 1763, the council, with its hostile majority, rejected it out of hand as one more concession by the governor to the nawab. Two members of the council accused Vansittart of having made a private arrangement with the nawab to protect his own private trade, but they could produce no evidence. When the nawab learned that Vansittart's agreement with him had been rejected by the council, he took the dramatic step of removing all duties on trade, for Indians as well as for the British. The council were enraged and Vansittart's plea that Britons could compete in a system of free trade with Indians and other foreigners was disregarded. The majority argued that by remitting the duties the nawab had declared war on the company, and the army should be prepared to march to force the nawab to restore the duties or to face the consequences of being deposed.<br>
<br>The nawab prepared for war, which began after the company's agent at Patna, William Ellis, one of Vansittart's bitterest enemies, attacked the nawab's forces in June 1763. When Ellis and the other Europeans with him were captured and put to death, the council insisted that war was inevitable. Vansittart was against war, as he felt that Mir Kasim had been driven to desperation by the actions of Ellis, and he also opposed the council's plans to replace Mir Kasim with the old nawab, Mir Jafar, who would obviously be a puppet of the council majority. Vansittart and Hastings were attacked in the council as profiting from their relationship with Mir Kasim, a murderer of Britons, but being powerless before the majority, and unwilling to show publicly the extent of the divisions, Vansittart signed the declaration of war on 7 July 1763. The conflict dragged on for over a year until Mir Kasim's defeat, along with his allies the nawab of Oudh and the Mughal emperor Shah Alam, at Buxar on 23 October 1764, perhaps the most important of all British military victories in India as it gave the company effective territorial control of vast areas of Bengal and Bihar.<br>
<br>This, however, was no triumph for Vansittart, who had long since wearied of India. Frustrated by the opposition in the council, and suffering from what may have been malaria, he had planned to resign in December 1763, but the majority of the council surprisingly urged him to stay until a successor could be appointed. He agreed to do so, not leaving until December 1764.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEngland"></a>Return to England</h2>Back in England Vansittart became involved in the complex and shifting politics of the proprietors and directors of the East India Company, where Robert Clive, once his chief supporter but now estranged because of Vansittart's deposing of Mir Jafar, vied with Laurence Sulivan for influence in the company and parliament. Vansittart sided with Sulivan in these contests. Clive's supporters, especially Luke Scrafton, assailed his record and his personal character in speeches, newspaper articles, and books, which were answered with equal venom by Vansittart's friends. The most interesting production of the literary war, however, came from Vansittart himself. Before he had left Bengal, he had sent copies of relevant documents to his friends in London, published as <span class="italic">Original Papers Relative to the Disturbances in Bengal</span>, which he then used as the basis for his remarkable book <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Transaction in Bengal from 1760 to 1764</span>, which, while defending his own policies and vindicating his character, provided details of the often very cogent counter-arguments of his opponents as well as numerous letters from the nawabs of Bengal.<br>
<br>Vansittart was elected to parliament for the borough of Reading on 16 March 1768, using his connections to further his own and his friends' interests in the company and in parliament. His main concerns at this time seem to have been financial. How much money he had actually made in India is not known, but his brother George later remarked that one needed &pound;50,000 to retire, and he probably had made at least that much. His enemies accused him, in fact, of &#145;trying to encircle the general trade of Bengal under his own direction&#146;, but it was assumed that governors of Bengal would be very wealthy men, for, without apology, &#145;they were in India to get rich&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">East Indian Fortunes</span>, 217, 115, 3). He was able to buy an estate and a house in Berkshire, but he had difficulty in transferring his Indian money back to Britain. Remitting money from India, because of the company's rules, was often harder than making it, and Vansittart thought of returning to India to retrieve what he could of his fortune. His situation was made worse by heavy losses that he had sustained as a result of his involvement in the company's politics in London.<br>
<br>In 1769 elections took place for the directors of the governing body of the East India Company. Since voting rights depended on stock ownership, Vansittart, in alliance with Laurence Sulivan, organized a complex system of borrowing money to buy stock. However, an unexpected financial crisis ruined many speculators in the company's stocks, with Vansittart among those hardest hit. Hope for his salvation came with news of the disastrous state of the company's affairs in India. The crisis prompted the decision to send out three commissioners with power to override the councils which had given such trouble to Vansittart and other governors. It was assumed that there would be opportunity of great financial gain for the commissioners, and Vansittart's friends, hoping that he would be saved from further ruin, got him appointed. He was balanced by an opponent, Luke Scrafton, and by Francis Forde, regarded as somewhat neutral in the company's internal politics, who had served with Vansittart in Madras. The commissioners sailed in September 1769, and were in Cape Town on 27 December, but the ship apparently foundered some time later, for it was never heard of again. How desperately Vansittart needed money was shown when his executors found he had virtually no resources in England, except the properties in Berkshire and Greenwich.<br>
<br>It was an anticlimactic end for someone who, ten years before, Clive and other well-wishers had thought best suited to be governor of Bengal and to secure it for Britain. Historians of British India, looking back on the building of an empire, have not, however, dealt kindly with his reputation, measuring him against the great conquerors&#151;Clive, Hastings, and Wellesley. Thus H. H. Dodwell, one of the most influential, summarized his career by saying that he proved &#145;lamentably deficient in the art of government&#146;, for &#145;he could neither judge men, nor manage them, nor read the future&#146;  (Dodwell, 215&#150;16). That Vansittart did not look at mid-eighteenth-century India and see it as a field for fulfilling Britain's imperial destiny is perfectly true. None the less what emerges from the record is a perceptive, humane intelligence, aware that the complex political organizations of the Mughals and their successor states were undergoing enormous changes, but that it was best to wait and try to understand what was happening and why. Perhaps this is what he was implying when he once wrote to Hastings that &#145;I love peace and quietness and have learnt to make allowances for the different tempers and passions of men&#146;  (Vansittart, 2.175).<br>
