<span class="headword">Russell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elliot]</span>,  Frances Anna Maria <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>, Countess Russell <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Lady John Russell]</span>  (1815&#150;1898), <span class="occ">political wife</span>, was born on 15 November 1815 at Minto House, Roxburghshire, the second daughter and third child in the family of five sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8662/', "Gilbert Elliot Murray Kynynmound, second earl of Minto (1782&#150;1859)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Brydone (1786&#150;1853). Lady Fanny spent her childhood at Minto and was brought up with a strong sense of obligation and responsibility towards her large family. Her father's political career began in earnest in 1832, when he was sent by the whig government to Berlin as minister, taking his family with him. They remained there until 1834, and in 1835 Minto's appointment as lord privy seal took the family to London, just at the time when Lady Fanny was ready to be launched into society.<br>
<br>It is difficult to assess the impact made by Lady Fanny Elliot on the whig society she joined in London. In her own diary, she repeatedly comments on how &#145;it is so impossible for anybody ever to admire my looks or think me agreeable&#146;  (MacCarthy and Russell, 25), and laments her social awkwardness. Others were less critical, and portraits from the 1840s and 1850s show an attractive woman with abundant glossy brown hair and a trim figure. Lady Fanny was clearly a highly intelligent woman, although she was not troubled with a systematic education. Her interest was early captured by politics&#151;not, as was more common, by the personalities of the politicians she came to know, but by the great issues of the day, and by the truly whiggish belief in the value and necessity of public service. Her religious convictions were strong: brought up in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, she disliked ritual and the priestly caste as much as the evangelical conviction of the necessity for personal conversion. In later life she became a Unitarian. These characteristics, along with her protectiveness and sense of obligation towards her family, were to define her public role.<br>
<br>The leading whig <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24325/', "Lord John Russell (1792&#150;1878)")</script> was well known to the Elliots. A widower with two daughters, and four children from his wife's previous marriage, he was more than twenty years older than Fanny Elliot. Two years after his first wife's death, he fell in love with his colleague's daughter, and he proposed to her in writing on 3 September 1840. To the relief of her mother, Lady Fanny refused: the age difference was too great (and the burden of the inherited children would be no small consideration). But Lord John literally haunted her dreams, and unavoidably they continued to meet in London. On 8 June 1841 her hesitation was overcome, and they were engaged. Lady Minto had long been won over&#151;&#145;it was not an ordinary person that could suit her &hellip; it is evident how fully he appreciates the singular beauty of her character&#146;  (MacCarthy and Russell, 43)&#151;and his family accepted the match, with reservations: &#145;The family are not liked and are considered jobbers, but I hear a good report of her &hellip; I expect he ought to be the best judge of his own happiness&#146;  (G. Blakiston, <span class="italic">Lord William Russell and his Wife, 1815&#150;1846</span>, 1972, 449), wrote his brother. Perhaps as importantly, Lady Fanny was approved at Holland House: &#145;good tempered and sensible&#146; was Lady Holland's verdict. On 20 July 1841 they were married at Minto, and a month later the whigs fell from office.<br>
<br>Lady John found great happiness in her marriage, which helped to reconcile her to the loss of her beloved Scotland and to the overnight acquisition of six children, a household to manage, and the public gaze which inevitably focused on the wife of so prominent a politician. Unlike many of her contemporaries, such as Emily Palmerston, Mary Anne Disraeli, and Catherine Gladstone, Lady John Russell never came to relish her position at the political centre. Her health was not good during the 1840s&#151;she had a number of miscarriages, as well as giving birth to four children between 1842 and 1853, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38800/', "(Francis Albert) Rollo Russell")</script>. She was also notoriously anxious about the effects on her husband's health of holding office. Her hostility towards London life, in particular, was undisguised, and although she carried out the social obligations of a political wife, she always viewed it as &#145;a sacrifice of private happiness to public duty&#146;  (MacCarthy and Russell, 73). Fiercely proud of her husband and his reputation, she told him in 1845, &#145;My ambition is that you should be the head of the most moral and religious government the country has ever had&#146;  (ibid., 72); it was ironic, then, that his connection with her family led to accusations of jobbery and of undue influence exercised over him by both his wife and his father-in-law. Lady John was widely blamed by politicians for the failings of her husband, who vacillated over forming or joining ministries, but her real weakness was an inability (and unwillingness) to play by the rules of the political game. &#145;I shall not behave like an angel any more&#146;, she threatened her father in 1851, &#145;but say what I think everywhere &amp; to every-body &amp; do a great deal of mischief &amp; break up the ministry&#146;  (Reynolds, 181). In particular, she has been blamed for the souring of relations between Russell and Gladstone (whom in later life she came to admire greatly for his commitment to Ireland). The relief she felt at her husband's final retirement from active politics in 1868 (he had been created Earl Russell in 1861) was intense.<br>
<br>Lady John's interest in political issues and her commitment to a radical whig agenda never wavered. Her letters (particularly to her husband, father, and sons) show a clear understanding of the questions of the day, and a passionate conviction that justice should be done. She believed in liberty for Italy, home rule for Ireland, and parliamentary reform for Westminster; she supported religious liberty (although she fervently disliked &#145;theology&#146; and ritual, and especially Roman Catholicism) and women's rights (although she believed that in some respects &#145;women's wrongs&#146; had been exaggerated); and, a true whig, she had her reservations about monarchy: &#145;I consider Princes &amp; Princesses as unmitigated evils&#151;Sovereigns have their use in the world, but nobody has ever yet told me of any good purpose served by the existence of these offshoots of Sovereignty&#146;  (Lady John to Rollo Russell, 13 March 1863, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. e. 111, fols. 226&#150;8).<br>
<br>After Russell's retirement he and his wife continued to live at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park, the home provided for them by the queen. There Lady Russell entertained politicians, men of letters and science, and international visitors; unfettered by the demands of active politics, Pembroke Lodge became a place of pleasant resort and Lady Russell an agreeable hostess. The death of their widowed eldest son, Lord Amberley, in 1876, brought their two grandsons Frank and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35875/', "Bertrand Russell")</script> to live permanently with the Russells, but Lord Russell himself died in 1878. Lady Russell survived him by twenty years, during which her interests continued unabated. Among her close friends and correspondents at this time were the positivist Frederic Harrison and the Irish home rule MP Justin McCarthy. The latter described her insatiable desire for knowledge: &#145;she appears to have felt that whenever she came into converse with any fellow being she was in communication with one who could tell her something which she did not already know&#146;  (MacCarthy and Russell, 296). Lady Russell died at Pembroke Lodge on 17 January 1898, and was buried with her husband at Chenies in Buckinghamshire four days later.<br>
