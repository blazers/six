<span class="headword">Coffin,  John Pine</span>  (1778&#150;1830), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, fourth son of the Revd John Pine (1736&#150;1824), of East Down, Devon, who took the additional name of Coffin by royal licence in 1797, and his wife, Grace, the daughter of James Rowe of Alverdiscot, Devon, was born on 16 March 1778. In 1795 he obtained a cornetcy in the 4th dragoons, in which James Dalbiac and George Scovell were also subalterns, and became lieutenant therein in 1799. He was attached to the quartermaster-general's staff of the army in Egypt in 1801, and was present at the surrender of Cairo, and the attack on Alexandria from the westward. On the formation of the Royal Staff Corps (for engineer and other departmental duties under the quartermaster-general), he was appointed to a company, but the year after was promoted major, and removed to the permanent staff of the quartermaster-general's department, in which capacity he was in Dublin at the time of Emmet's insurrection, and continued to serve in Ireland until 1806, afterwards accompanying Lord Cathcart to the Isle of Rugen and in the expedition against Copenhagen in 1807. In 1808 he was sent to the Mediterranean as deputy quartermaster-general with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and was employed with the expedition to the Bay of Naples, which ended in the capture of Ischia and Procida.<br>
<br>In 1810 Coffin organized the flotilla of gunboats equipped for the defence of the Strait of Messina, when Murat's army was encamped on the opposite shore; and in 1813 he commanded the troops&#151;a battalion of the 10th foot&#151;on the <i>Thames</i> (32 guns, Captain Charles Napier), and the <i>Furieuse</i> (36 18-pounders, Captain William Mounsey), sent to attack the Isle of Ponza, which was captured by the frigates sailing right into the harbour, under a heavy cross-fire from the shore batteries, and landing the troops without losing a man. He was afterwards employed by Lord William Bentinck on staff duties at Tarragona, and at Genoa, and attained the rank of brevet colonel in 1814. After the renewal of hostilities in 1815, when the Austrian and Piedmontese armies of occupation, 100,000 strong, entered France, Coffin was attached, as British military commissioner with the rank of brigadier-general, to the Austro-Sardinians, who crossed Mont Cenis, and remained with them until they quitted French territory, in accordance with the treaty of Paris.<br>
<br>In 1817 Coffin was appointed regimental major of the Royal Staff Corps, at headquarters, Hythe, Kent, and in 1819 was nominated lieutenant-governor and second in command under Sir Hudson Lowe at St Helena, replacing Sir George Bingham. When Lowe left in July 1821, after Bonaparte's death, Coffin succeeded to the command, which he held until, the last of the king's troops having been removed, he was replaced in March 1823 by Brigadier-General Walker of the East India Company when government of the island reverted to the company. The council of the island was at first disposed to question Coffin's authority. He was promoted major-general in 1825.<br>
<br>Coffin married, on 13 April 1820, Maria, only daughter of George Monkland, late of Belmont, Bath; they had no children. He published <span class="italic">Account of the Battle of Austerlitz</span> (1806), translated from the German of Stutterheim. He died at Bath on 10 February 1830.<br>
