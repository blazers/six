<span class="headword">Colenso,  Francis Ernest <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1852&#150;1910), <span class="occ">campaigner for the rights of the Zulu people</span>, was born at Forncett St Mary, Norfolk, on 9 April 1852, the fourth child and second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5875/', "John William Colenso")</script>, who was then rector of Forncett St Mary, and his wife, (Sarah) Frances Bunyon (1816&#150;1893). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46549/', "Harriette Emily Colenso")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5874/', "Frances Ellen Colenso")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46549/', "Colenso, Harriette Emily")</script>] were his elder sisters. Most of Frank's childhood and early youth were spent at the family residence, Bishopstowe, adjacent to the mission station near Pietermaritzburg, Natal, known as Ekukanyeni (meaning in Zulu &#145;place of light&#146;), founded by his father, who became the first bishop of the newly created diocese of Natal and took his family to the colony in 1855. With his brother and three sisters Frank learned the Zulu language and was given the Zulu name Gebhuza, meaning &#145;to paw the ground and toss the head, as a bull&#146;.<br>
<br>Frank Colenso attended Kensington grammar school between 1862 and 1865. In 1870 he matriculated from his father's college, St John's, Cambridge, whence he graduated in 1874 having been ranked second senior optime in the mathematical tripos. In 1874 he was admitted to the Inner Temple, and gained experience of insurance work at the London office of the Norwich Union insurance company, of which his uncle Charles John Bunyon (1821&#150;1892) was actuary. In 1877 he was called to the bar and returned to Natal, where he practised as a barrister in Pietermaritzburg and Durban.<br>
<br>In December 1877 Colenso and his associate Dr Walter Smith notified the colonial and imperial authorities of their appointment as diplomatic agents to Cetshwayo, the Zulu king, in regard to the boundary dispute between Zululand and the Transvaal. The validity of the appointment was denied by both the Colonial Office in Britain and the governor of Natal. But it was most bitterly opposed by the colonial officials, not least members of the Shepstone family, who then occupied key positions in both the Transvaal and the Natal administrations and who objected to what they deemed to be the unwarranted interference of the Colenso family in &#145;native affairs&#146;. In both the Natal and the British press in 1878 and 1879 the arrangement was denounced as irresponsible, and even disloyal, Colenso being accused of turning the Zulu king against the missionaries in Zululand. His defenders in the controversy included F. W. Chesson, secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society. Some suggested that if Colenso and his colleague had been allowed a free hand to act, the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 might have been averted.<br>
<br>In 1879 Colenso returned to England, where he was appointed assistant secretary and assistant actuary to the Norwich Union at their head office in Norwich. On 13 November 1880 he married Sophie Frankland (<i>b</i>. 1855), daughter of the chemist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10083/', "Edward Frankland")</script>, a member of T. H. Huxley's famous X Club, with whom Bishop Colenso had been closely associated. In 1886 he became actuary and secretary to the English and Scottish Law Life Assurance Association in their London office where he remained until 1894, when he moved to the Eagle Insurance Company in London.<br>
<br>Colenso visited South Africa for a few months in 1900, but otherwise remained in England, where he campaigned for the rights of the African populations of Natal and Zululand. He channelled information from members of his family in Natal to radical and Liberal MPs and humanitarian organizations, wrote letters to the press, made representations to members of the government, and produced pamphlets and drew up petitions to publicize, and seek to remedy, the injustices suffered by the Zulu people. He was also involved with organizations that had the broader aim of promoting the interests of Africans and other colonized peoples, including the Pan-African Association, which organized the Pan-African Conference of 1900, and he acted as a point of contact and advice for deputations of Africans visiting London to make representations to the British government, Queen Victoria, and, subsequently, Edward VII.<br>
<br>Colenso supported his father's campaign to secure the release and return from exile of Langalibalele, the Natal Zulu chief, and Cetshwayo, and his sister Harriette's work in arranging the defence of Cetshwayo's son Dinizulu in his two trials for treason. In the decade after the Anglo-Zulu War Colenso sought to expose how the British government had been systematically misinformed by the Natal and Zululand administrations, and how the civil war and the disturbances there had been provoked and exacerbated by local officials. Following the Bambatha rebellion in 1906 Colenso published several pamphlets attacking the injustice of the court proceedings against those accused of taking part. In one case he attempted to prevent the execution of twelve Africans in Natal by enlisting the support of back-bench MPs, including Ramsay MacDonald. Colenso ensured that information was available to the public, the press, and parliament in Britain, so that pressure could be brought to bear on ministers and officials at the Colonial Office in London, who in turn would seek to curb the often aggressive designs of the local officials in Africa towards the Zulu royal family.<br>
<br>Colenso died at his home, Elangeni, in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, on 30 June 1910, and was survived by his wife, a son, and three daughters. Messages of sympathy, including those from J. R. Archer (later president of the African Progress Union) and the Zulu historian Magema Fuze, revealed the esteem in which he was held within the movement campaigning for the rights of African people.<br>
