<span class="headword">Peat,  Thomas</span>  (1707/8&#150;1780), <span class="occ">lecturer on science and almanac editor</span>, was born at Ashleyhay, near Wirksworth, Derbyshire, the son of a farmer. He soon showed an inclination for learning, which his father tried to repress. A brother, a joiner in Nottingham, to whom he became apprenticed, gave him no more encouragement. However, Cornelius Wildbore, a master dyer, who, like the Peats, regularly attended the Presbyterian High Pavement chapel, noticed him and enabled him to obtain books.<br>
<br>Peat became a writing master and teacher of mathematics, scientific lecturer, and land surveyor in Nottingham. In 1740 he was one of the principal projectors, with John Badder, William Whitehead, and others, of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Diary, or, The Mathematical Repository</span>, an annual almanac with literary and mathematical sections on similar lines to the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span>. Both Badder and Whitehead worked as surveyors with Peat. The first numbers, from 1741, were edited by Badder and had contributions from Peat; from 1749 to 1756 he was joint editor and on Badder's death in 1756 he became sole editor until his own death in 1780. His successor was the Revd Charles Wildbore, probably the son of his early patron. Subsequently Peat became anonymous editor of the <span class="italic">Poor Robin</span> almanac; his share in it ceased some time before his death.<br>
<br>Peat used the almanacs to advertise his services. About 1743 he projected a course of fourteen two-hour lectures at Nottingham on mechanics, hydrostatics, optics, pneumatics, astronomy, and the use of globes, possibly in association with William Griffis, who published a syllabus about 1746. Peat's undated syllabus was published at Nottingham, probably after 1753; the British Library copy has a manuscript note that the lectures were originally those of Griffis.<br>
<br>In 1768, when he was living at Thringstone, Leicestershire, Peat proposed to publish a map of the county from his own survey; in 1771 he removed to adjacent Swannington, and in 1779 he returned to Nottingham. He died in Nottingham, at his house in Greyfriars' Gate, on 21 February 1780, aged seventy-two.<br>
