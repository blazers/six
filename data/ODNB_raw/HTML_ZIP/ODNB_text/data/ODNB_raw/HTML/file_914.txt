<span class="headword">Austin,  Samuel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1652&#150;1671), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was most probably the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/913/', "Samuel Austin (b. 1605/6)")</script>, a religious poet. He became a commoner of Wadham College, Oxford, on 2 October 1652, took his BA in 1656, and afterwards moved to Cambridge. On the evidence of contemporary accounts, his character was not to the taste of those around him. His importance rests on the fact that while he was a commoner at Wadham his poetry was annotated by fellow students and published with satirical commendatory verses. Wood accuses Austin of vanity, saying that his fellow students &#145;served him as the wits did Tho. Coryat in his time&#146; publishing Austin's poetry under the title <span class="italic">Naps upon Parnasus: a Sleepy Muse Nipt and Pincht, though not Awakened</span> (1658). &#145;Among [Austin's satirists] were Tho. Flatman, Tho. Sprat, and Sam. Woodford [&hellip;] Silvanus Taylour and George Castle of Alls. coll. [and] Alexander Amidei a Jew and Florentine born, then a teacher of Hebrew and other tongues in the university&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 2.499, 3.675).<br>
<br>From this point in history it is difficult to state the extent of the wits' intervention and how much of Austin's work was left untouched by them. The first half of <span class="italic">Naps</span> contains the commendatory verse, most of which discusses Austin's obscurity and darkness as a poet, as in &#145;On Mr Somebody's <i>Poetical Naps Upon</i> Parnasus&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>'Tis vulgar to be <i>clear</i>. 'Tis but a Quibble<br>
</div>
<div>To write a verse that is intelligible.<br>
</div>
<div>But <i>Thy</i> judicious <i>Muse</i> shuns this Offence,<br>
</div>
<div>And <i>Scorns</i> the pedantry of writing <i>Sense</i>.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>While the second half appears to be Austin's work, there are many marginal notes pointing out the absurdity and meaninglessness of it, and caution must be exercised in attributing the verse as Austin's work alone. He was also mocked for <span class="italic">A Panegyrick on his Sacred Majesties Royal Person Charles II by the Grace of God King</span> (1661) which ends with the memorable couplet:<blockquote>
<div>Then let your Scepter never faile,<br>
</div>
<div>You are the Sun, and I the Snail.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Austin promised more in a similar vein, though it never appeared. He may also have written a bitter attack on the Quakers, <span class="italic">The Character of a Quaker in his True and Proper Colours, or, The Clownish Hypocrite Anatomized</span> (1671), in which the Quaker is simultaneously claimed to be controlled by &#145;his <i>Holinesses</i> invisible hand behind the Curtain&#146; and as having &#145;no more Christianity in him than a <i>Turk</i>&#146;.<br>
