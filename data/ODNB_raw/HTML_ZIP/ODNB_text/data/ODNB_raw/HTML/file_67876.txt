<span class="headword">Fewterer,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1536), <span class="occ">Bridgettine monk and author</span>, was the son of Thomas Fewterer and his wife, Margaret; nothing else is known of his origins or early life. In 1501&#150;2 he supplicated for a grace at Cambridge, graduating BA in 1502&#150;3 and MA on 9 May 1506; he supplicated for graces in 1514&#150;15 but never took the degree of BTh. Elected to a fellowship at Pembroke College in 1505 he held various university and college offices over the next ten years: keeper of the Neel and Wythorn chest in 1507&#150;8, junior college treasurer in 1509, senior college treasurer in 1513 and 1515, and university preacher in 1510&#150;11. He was ordained deacon in February 1507 and priested on 3 April that year.<br>
<br>About 1517 Fewterer became a Bridgettine monk of Syon Abbey, Middlesex, where his administrative experience, preaching ability, and scholarship would have been appreciated. His was the second largest donation to the brethren's library and the seventy-seven volumes included recent patristic editions, humanist authors, and spiritual writers such as Bonaventure, Gerson, the Victorines, and Ludolphus. He began an English translation (from Latin) of John Climacus's <span class="italic">De triginta gradibus</span> which was completed by Richard Whitford (not apparently extant), but his most substantial and significant work was <span class="italic">The Myrrour or Glasse of Christes Passion</span> (1534). This made considerable use of Bonaventure, Ludolphus, and Jordanus and gave English readers the kind of doctrinal teaching and structured devotional application previously restricted to Latin readers. The prayers which ended each of the sixty-five sections were reprinted anonymously as <span class="italic">Devoute Prayers in Englysshe of Thactes of our Redemption</span> (<i>c</i>.1535), and an abbreviated version was written out mid-century (London, St Paul's Cathedral, MS 52.B.22).<br>
<br>In 1523 Fewterer was elected seventh confessor-general of Syon, making him responsible for the spiritual guidance and priestly duties of the whole community. Together with the lady abbess he was executor of the will of Sir Richard Sutton (<i>d</i>. 1524), steward of Syon and co-founder of Brasenose College; together they also saw into print <span class="italic">The Myrrour of Oure Lady</span> (1530), a translation and rationale of Syon's masses and offices. In 1526 and again in 1532 he gave vestments and chapel furnishings to his old college, Pembroke.<br>
<br>Fewterer apparently accepted the <span class="roman">Acts of Succession and Supremacy</span> of 1534, preaching twice in support of the king's title; Fisher, More, and the London Carthusians refused with fatal consequences. In July 1534 he was examined by Thomas Bedyll, Cromwell's agent, and admitted that he had seen Fisher's correspondence and possessed a book by him which he surrendered to the commissioner; he also put his name to a letter urging the London Carthusians to conform. In August Bedyll described him as &#145;a sad man, bothe tractable and comformable to do everything according to his dutie&#146;. Was he trying to buy time, or did he, like many other devout souls, persuade himself that obedience to his monarch really was his religious duty? He died on 26 September 1536 at Syon, where he was also buried.<br>
