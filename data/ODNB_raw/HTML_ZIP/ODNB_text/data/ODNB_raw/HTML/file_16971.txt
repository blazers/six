<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Long,  John St John</span>  (1798&#150;1834), <span class="occ">quack and painter</span>, was born at Newcastle West, co. Limerick, the second of three children of John Long and Anne St John. His father was a basket maker and handyman, and both parents were protestant. After demonstrating an ability in sketching, Long was sponsored in 1816 for two years by local residents in Doneraile, co. Cork, to undertake art classes at Dublin Academy, where he became a pupil of the still-life painter Daniel Richardson (<i>fl</i>. 1783&#150;1830). After his return to Limerick, Long painted still lifes, landscapes, and portraits, and supported himself by giving drawing and painting lessons. He added St John to his name some time before 1822, the year he moved to London, where he assisted in the studios of Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Martin, and William Young Ottley. Long's own paintings, which were chiefly of biblical, allegorical, and historical subjects, were exhibited at the Society of British Artists, and at the British Institution in 1824&#150;5.<br>
<br>However, Long could not support himself by painting alone, and he turned instead to medicine. Although unqualified, he had gained some knowledge of anatomy from his art training. Initially he began practice in chiropody, but soon he effected his first &#145;cure&#146; for consumption, in 1826. Long claimed that bodily impurities could be removed by his unique lotion, which was rubbed onto the back, shoulders, and chest, or, alternatively, inhaled. After his death, this lotion was found to consist of turpentine, acetic acid, and egg yolk. This counter-irritation cauterized the skin, and was designed to draw inflammations and lung ulcers to the surface. Once the impurities had been removed, the resulting blister was soothed with cabbage leaves. The corrosive liniment was claimed to cure consumption, rheumatism, gout, measles, smallpox, and even insanity. Long began this treatment in Howland Street, Fitzroy Square, in 1827, but soon after moved to 41 Harley Street. A tall, dark-complexioned, and handsome man, with a slender figure and impeccable manners, Long was particularly successful in gaining a large female clientele. Indeed between 1827 and 1834 he undoubtedly enjoyed the most lucrative and fashionable quack medical practice in London.<br>
<br>In 1830, Long was indicted in two court cases involving consumptive female patients who had died after being &#145;rubbed&#146; with Long's lotion. While Long was acquitted in one case, he was found guilty of the manslaughter of Miss Catherine Cashin at the Old Bailey on 23 October 1830 despite the favourable testimony of sixty-three of his patients. Long was discharged on payment of a fine of &pound;250, which he flamboyantly paid on the spot. His practice did not suffer adversely from the publicity. The coroner in the second case was Thomas Wakley, editor of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. Wakley described Long as the &#145;king of humbugs&#146;  (Wakley, &#145;John St John Long&#146;, 506) and his patients as the &#145;willing dupes and fools of a dishonest and tricking knave&#146;  (Wakley, &#145;Second trial&#146;, 726). The cases brought against Long provoked him to write two books setting forth his methods: <span class="italic">Discoveries in the Science and Art of Healing</span> (1830) and <span class="italic">A critical exposure of the ignorance and malpractice of certain medical practitioners, in their theory and treatment of diseases</span> (1831).<br>
<br>Long, who did not marry, died on 2 July 1834, at Elm Grove, near Roehampton. His death was allegedly due to consumption, which he had steadfastly refused to treat by his own methods. This story is almost certainly apocryphal. Long had fallen from his horse in May 1834, and a later bad cough caused a ruptured blood vessel. His tomb was erected in Kensal Green cemetery, Middlesex, and was built in the style of a Greek temple, decorated with Aesculapian emblems. His epitaph noted that he had &#145;many enemies and few friends&#146;. The secret of his lotion was later purchased from his executors, allegedly for &pound;10,000, by Lewis C. Kinchela, an Irish medical practitioner&#151;to unknown success. Although a minor talent as a painter, Long exemplified how swiftly fame and fortune could be achieved by unqualified medical practitioners in early nineteenth-century London.<br>
