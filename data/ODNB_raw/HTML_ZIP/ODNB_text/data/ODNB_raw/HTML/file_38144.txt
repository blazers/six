<span class="headword">Witt,  Richard</span>  (1567/8&#150;1624), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was baptized on 27 March 1568 at St Clement, Eastcheap, London, the only and posthumous child of Richard Witt (<i>d</i>. 1567), salter, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Dickenson, butcher. He was descended from a Northamptonshire farming family, his grandfather probably being William Wytt of Dene. His father died in November 1567, leaving his mother pregnant and in debt. In February 1570 she married William Smyth, embroiderer, of London. They had five children, two of whom were admitted to Christ's Hospital. Witt's own education is obscure. He may perhaps have been the Richard Whit or White who matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1584. He later became a freeman of the Salters' Company, like his father, but it is probable that his only occupation was as a mathematical practitioner. His continuing care of his mother was acknowledged when, in 1605, Anne Smyth, now a widow again, made her will, Witt being the main beneficiary:<blockquote>And whereas I do owe and am indebted unto my said son, Richard Witt, in the sum of seven pounds, which he at divers and sundry times disbursed and lent unto me in my want and necessity, and hath been alway a careful loving and kind son towards me, I do therefore give unto him &hellip;</blockquote>In 1610 Witt joined with seven other London mathematicians in recommending a new book on accountancy and arithmetic, William Colson's <span class="italic">A General Tresury &hellip; of Accounts for All Countries in Christendome</span>, which was published in 1612 and contained the earliest tables of compound interest to appear in an English book.<br>
<br>Possibly Colson's limited venture into this field inspired Witt to write his own much more comprehensive book, both the first to be written in English, and the first to be published in England, dealing solely with compound interest. Entitled <span class="italic">Arithmeticall Questions, Touching the Buying or Exchange of Annuities</span> (1613), it delved deeply into the subject in a very practical way. The book was examined and corrected at the press by the author himself. It contained accumulation and discount tables based on 10 per cent per annum interest, which was the rate of interest usually charged on loans, together with a range of tables based on lower rates. The book contained 124 worked examples, the solutions to some of which were extremely elegant. In particular these demonstrated a knowledge of the equation of payments (whereby one series of payments has to be equal in value to a different series) which has since come to be a fundamental concept in actuarial work. They also showed a clear understanding of the difference between, for example, rates of 10 per cent per annum and 2&frac12; per cent per quarter. Witt made some remarks about the usefulness of arithmetic, pointing out that, although some businessmen managed to get by without such knowledge, &#145;it is as true that the blind drink many a fly&#146;. The book was also one of the earliest publications to use a form of decimal arithmetic. A second, revised edition was published in 1634.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1613 Witt married Helen Pennaunt, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berry (<i>d</i>. 1631), a widow about two years younger than himself, in the parish church of St Stephen, Coleman Street. He moved into her home, &#145;a small low messuage or tenement&#146;, on the corner of Coleman Street and London Wall. They had no children. Unfortunately the house had to be rebuilt about 1619 and this cost the couple almost all their estate&#151;&pound;290.<br>
<br>Witt died on 4 November 1624, presumably in London, and was buried next to his mother in St Clement, Eastcheap, four days later. In his will, written in his own hand, he donated some of his books to Oxford University and bequeathed to his servant, Thomas Painter, &#145;all my books and papers of Arithmetic and Geometry in English and all my copies written and printed and all mine instruments of geometry&#146;. Many of his relations were left a copy of Calvin's <span class="italic">Institutions</span> or a bible. He left &pound;8 to the Salters' Company, for a supper on the day of his burial.<br>
