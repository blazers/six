<span class="headword">Smith,  Walter Campbell-</span>  (1887&#150;1988), <span class="occ">mineralogist and petrologist</span>, was born on 30 November 1887 at 41 York Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, the second son of George Hamilton Smith (1860&#150;1929), paper merchant, and his wife, Charlotte Eliza (1859&#150;1935), daughter of Henry William Ashford, chairmaker, of Birmingham and his wife, Charlotte. Known always as Campbell Smith, the hyphenated form of the name was formalized by deed poll in 1959.<br>
<br>After attending Solihull School (1895&#150;1906), Campbell Smith entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating with first-class honours (1910) and becoming Wiltshire prizeman in mineralogy in 1909. On 1 December 1910 he joined the mineralogy department at the British Museum (Natural History) initially to work on minerals but, with the arrival in 1913 of the geological specimens collected by the <i>Terra Nova</i> Antarctic Expedition, he was assigned to describe their physical properties. Thereafter he became first and foremost a petrologist.<br>
<br>In 1910 Campell Smith joined the Territorial Army (Artists' Rifles) and was mobilized on the declaration of war in 1914, serving throughout, mainly in France. In 1917 he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry on the Blaireville&#150;Ficheux front the previous year. He was demobilized on 11 April 1919 and was made a brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1935. He was later awarded the Territorial decoration.<br>
<br>Between the wars the British Colonial Geological Surveys were investigating the complex geology of Africa and Campbell Smith's help was sought in examining carbonate rocks collected by Frank Dixey from within igneous complexes in Nyasaland. From his microscopical observations Campbell Smith concluded, contrary to contemporary opinion, that these were igneous carbonatites rather than sedimentary limestones. He continued to develop his ideas as more occurrences were investigated and he chose carbonatites as the subject of his presidential address to the Geological Society in 1956. This, together with a similar review by Pecora in the USA, changed world opinion. Since that time many more carbonatites have been discovered and their economic potential has been increasingly exploited. In addition to his Antarctic and African work Campbell Smith wrote about one hundred articles on minerals, meteorites, and other petrological topics. He was also well known for his work on Neolithic jadeite implements and he was awarded the ScD degree in 1939.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1936 Campbell Smith married Susan Finnegan (1903&#150;1995), a zoologist and the first woman to be appointed to the senior staff of the British Museum (Natural History). They had a son (<i>b</i>. 1938) who became vicar of Goudhurst, Kent, and an adopted daughter (<i>b</i>. 1942). Campbell Smith became deputy keeper of the mineralogy department on 1 April 1931 and keeper on 27 May 1937. He was appointed CBE in 1949 and retired on 30 November 1952.<br>
<br>Campbell Smith was president of the Geological Society (1955&#150;6), secretary (1921&#150;32), and Murchison medallist for 1945. He was president also of the Mineralogical Society (1945&#150;8), general secretary (1927&#150;38), foreign secretary (1959&#150;67), managing trustee (1949&#150;55), and four times a councillor. He contributed greatly to the founding of the International Mineralogical Association.<br>
<br>Slim and erect, Campbell-Smith was regarded highly by his scientific colleagues, his regimental association, and his many friends. The warmth of his personality was such that the word &#145;gentleman&#146; most accurately describes him. The cordiality and affection of his home meant much to him, as did his personal faith; he was a lifelong member of the Anglican church. Campbell-Smith died of old age at his home, Roof Tops, Back Lane, Goudhurst, on 6 December 1988 and was cremated at Tunbridge Wells on 13 December. His long life and distinguished career were celebrated at a memorial service in the parish church at Goudhurst later that day.<br>
