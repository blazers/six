<span class="headword">Thurtell,  John</span>  (1794&#150;1824), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, born on 21 December 1794, was the eldest son in the large family of Thomas Thurtell (1765&#150;1846), merchant (and in 1828 mayor of Norwich), and his wife, Susanna. The family home was at Lakenham, Norwich, and Thurtell may have received the rudiments of education at Norwich grammar school. After five years as a second lieutenant in the Royal Marines he became in 1814 a bombazine manufacturer, but went bankrupt in 1821 and moved to London. His venture of running a public house in Long Acre soon failed. He then acted intermittently as a trainer and backer of pugilists. Robustly built and muscular, he was an amateur boxer and had already been prominent in prize-fighting circles in his Norwich days. George Borrow's <span class="italic">Lavengro</span> (1851) gives a memorable account of him at one such fight. His downward progress continued as he lost heavily at gambling. In June 1823 he and his brother Thomas, in the teeth of the evidence indicating arson, were awarded &pound;1900 in their action against the County Fire Office over a warehouse fire. Payment was, however, withheld pending an indictment for conspiracy to defraud. Thurtell's desperate financial situation was aggravated by continued gambling, in which he was no match for crooked adversaries. Among these was William Weare of Lyon's Inn, a former waiter and professional gamester against whom Thurtell bore a grudge for cheating him of &pound;300 at cards. He persuaded Weare to accompany him out of London on 24 October 1823. He may have been seeking revenge for the lost &pound;300; he may have been hoping that Weare would be carrying a sizeable sum of money. For whatever reason, he was determined on murder.<br>
<br>Thurtell had two accomplices, William Probert and Joseph Hunt. It was to Probert's cottage in Gill's Hill Lane, near Radlett, Hertfordshire, that the gig carrying Thurtell and Weare headed. Probert and Hunt followed on behind. Once in the lane Thurtell shot Weare at point-blank range with a pistol, but the bullet glanced off the victim's cheekbone. He then cut Weare's throat and jammed the pistol into his skull. Probert and Hunt arrived shortly afterwards and helped to dump the body in a pond in Probert's garden, but later it was transferred to a more distant pond. Thurtell had mislaid the pistol and knife, which were discovered by two labourers. An investigation soon led to the arrest of the three suspects, and Hunt, against a promise of his life, lost no time in disclosing where the corpse was. The magistrates' examination touched off an outburst of sensation-mongering, making the case the first trial by newspaper and the most notorious of the decade. Liberal use of engravings secured the future of illustrated crime journalism; broadsheets, chapbooks, and ballads flooded the streets. The case was also taken up on stage, even before the trial, with a play called <span class="italic">The Gamblers</span>, in which appeared the very horse and gig used by Thurtell.<br>
<br>Probert turned king's evidence. In accordance with the custom of the time the accused men had to defend themselves. No confession of guilt entered Thurtell's measured speech. The best passages were of his own composition; the judge described them as &#145;eminently manly, energetic, and powerful&#146;. Hunt could utter no more than one sentence before having his plea read for him. Both were found guilty and sentenced to death. Thurtell showed remarkable sang-froid throughout. One full day elapsed between sentencing and hanging. During it, Thurtell was anxious to learn the result of the big prize-fight of the day before, and repeatedly assured Hunt that he was forgiven. He appeared just as self-possessed on the scaffold outside Hertford gaol on 9 January 1824. The inglorious Hunt had his sentence commuted to transportation to Botany Bay.<br>
<br>The Gill's Hill murder took powerful hold of the popular imagination, despite its bungling brutality. The fever aroused by press and pamphlets was heightened by Thurtell's studied composure during his final week and his perceived fall from respectability through evil acquaintance. Relics were much sought after. Bits of Thurtell's corpse disappeared when it was dissected in front of a throng at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Memorabilia were preserved in several museums. The skeleton eventually passed to the Royal College of Surgeons of England, where the skull was displayed. The case was manna from heaven for the moralists of post-Regency England, who inveighed against the twin evils of gambling and pugilism. Magistrates cracked down on the ring. The card-playing, prize-fighting, horse-racing, and cock-fighting set known as the Fancy faded away. The affair was treated by a remarkable array of authors: De Quincey, Borrow, Bulwer-Lytton, Carlyle, and Dickens all made use of it; Lamb, Thackeray, FitzGerald, and Browning were intrigued by it. Walter Scott made a detour on the way from London to Scotland in 1828 to visit the scene of the crime, and revelled in the lines ascribed to William Webb (which Browning also admired):<blockquote>
<div>His throat they cut from ear to ear,<br>
</div>
<div>His brains they battered in,<br>
</div>
<div>His name was Mr William Weare,<br>
</div>
<div>Wot lived in Lyon's Inn.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
