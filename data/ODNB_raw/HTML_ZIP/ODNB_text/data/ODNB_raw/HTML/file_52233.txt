<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Women traders and artisans in London</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>1200&#150;<em>c.</em>1500) <span class="occ"></span>formed a significant group within the city's workforce at every social level. City custom allowed them considerable economic opportunities. No more than men are they commonly recorded before about 1250, but thereafter wills and the records alike of city government and of London's craft and trading associations bring their activities into ever sharper focus, in spite of the difficulties created by the instability of female surnames, resulting from migration and multiple marriages. The greater visibility of women in London's economic life in the later middle ages is not solely the result of the thickening of the records, however. The demographic decline which reduced the population of the city by half between 1300 and 1400 created an acute labour shortage which threw women more prominently into the trained labour force. So they are to be found not only at the poor and unskilled end of the labour market, but also training as apprentices, as independent artisans, managers of craft workshops, and heads of trading households.<h2>
<a name="Huckstersandprostitutes"></a>Hucksters and prostitutes</h2>At the poorest end of the economic scale women were found in London selling a variety of goods, but particularly foods that they had grown or cooked themselves, or had bought in a city market, or from a wholesaler, and then sold on. Such women were known as hucksters, a word that appears about 1300 and which applied primarily, but not exclusively, to women. Hucksters appear in the mayor's court pursuing debtors or being pursued by their creditors. Most of them are only names, but <a name="cosubject_75207"></a><span class="headword">Joan Staunford</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1379)<span class="occ"></span>, who leased one of the stalls at the Cheapside Cross, can be more precisely identified. She was a frutestere, a seller of fruit, with an eight-year-old son but, apparently, deserted by her husband. In October of the year in which his mother had leased the stall, young John had been bequeathed 40<i>s</i>. in the will of John Cornwaille, a currier. In order that she might receive the money on her son's behalf, in December 1379 the mayor and chamberlain entrusted Joan with the guardianship of John and the 40<i>s</i>., also providing two men to act as her sureties. Sixteen years later, when John would have been twenty-four, he came to court to seek his 40<i>s</i>. By this time his mother and one of her sureties were dead, so the court decided that the money should be levied from the tenements of the remaining surety. Hucksters were quite often in trouble in the mayor's court, not least when they engaged in the ubiquitous trade of selling secondhand clothing. Fourteen of the sixty-eight Londoners convicted in 1321 of selling clothes at the evening markets held at Cornhill and in Cheapside (contrary to civic regulation because it was too dark to examine the goods properly) were women.<br>
<br>Women hucksters were also sometimes convicted of deliberately practising to deceive the ignorant customer. <a name="cosubject_75208"></a><span class="headword">Alice Causton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1364)<span class="occ"></span> used unsealed measures when she sold beer and thickened their bottoms with 1&frac12; inches of pitch. She was condemned to stand in the thewe (a special pillory for women in which they were confined by the neck) and half the false measure was tied to the pillory beside her; the other half was to remain at the guildhall. Other women worked in London as prostitutes. Many of those involved in this trade must have been poor, but not all were. <a name="cosubject_75209"></a><span class="headword">Alison Boston</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1424)<span class="occ"></span> was prosecuted by the city authorities and convicted not for being a prostitute herself but for having taken on a girl as an apprentice whom she then hired out for &#145;immoral purposes&#146;. She was condemned to the pillory, where she stood for an hour on three market days and was brought from prison to the pillory &#145;with pipes and minstralcy&#146; to make her humiliation as public as possible. Displayed alongside her was a bill written in English to explain her offence, and this was carefully copied into the city's letter-book.<h2>
<a name="Femaleapprentices"></a>Female apprentices</h2>The city authorities may have been anxious to make a public example of Alison Boston because she had betrayed the trust and obligations required of the mistress of an apprentice. As early as 1276 girl apprentices were found in the city, but the surge in their numbers came in the century after 1350, when thirty-eight are recorded. It is remarkable, considering how few medieval apprentice indentures survive, that five of the thirteen from London concern girls. In these the girls were bound as apprentices to learn their craft for seven years on exactly the same terms as boys. <a name="cosubject_75210"></a><span class="headword">Eleanor Fyncham</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1447)<span class="occ"></span> was the daughter of Simon Fyncham, a prosperous parvenu gentleman from the Norfolk parish of Fincham, where he farmed 400 acres and contributed substantially to the building of the church tower; her brothers were &#145;parish gentry&#146;, London lawyers, and merchants. On 27 February 1447 Eleanor's brother John Fyncham, &#145;gentleman&#146;, acted as her surety when she sealed (with her own seal) the indenture in which she bound herself to <a name="cosubject_75211"></a><span class="headword">Anne Rotheley</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1496), <span class="occ">throwester de serico or silkwoman</span>, the wife of the London goldsmith William Rotheley (<i>d</i>. 1469). The Rotheleys had several apprentices but do not appear always to have treated them well. Anne had been married before to another goldsmith, Richard Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1442&times;5), and in this marriage also had traded <i>sole</i> as a silk throwster and taken on apprentices. One of these, Joan Bosoun, the daughter of another goldsmith, sued Anne for failing to enrol her indentures at the guildhall within the first year of her term. William Rotheley served several times as warden between 1444 and 1465, but in 1468 he was fined by the Goldsmiths' court for having shut his &#145;mayde&#146; (perhaps a reference to one of his wife's apprentices) out of his house at night, so that she had to borrow money to buy a night's lodging at the Pewter Pot. Such behaviour was thought to reflect badly on the Goldsmiths' fellowship and to be &#145;against all humanity&#146;, and Rotheley was fined 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>The city authorities repeatedly showed themselves concerned to ensure that apprentices were properly treated, and their indentures enrolled at the guildhall within the first year of their service. Such precautions were needed not least because girl apprentices might be very young. <a name="cosubject_75212"></a><span class="headword">Agnes Tickhill</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1410&#150;1417)<span class="occ"></span>, the daughter of the successful saddler William Tickhill, was placed as an apprentice with the wiredrawer William Celler for a term of fourteen years. This apprenticeship had been arranged by Thomasina March, a widow not free of the city who lived in Buckinghamshire. In 1417 William Tickhill, claiming that his daughter had been indentured without his knowledge or consent, complained that William Celler had left the city and had not taught Agnes his craft, nor had he enrolled her indentures at the guildhall. Agnes was now living with William Celler's wife, Joan, who claimed to be teaching her the craft of a cardmaker (for carding wool) for which she had been properly apprenticed the previous Christmas. Joan admitted that Agnes had originally been apprenticed under age, that Thomasina March had no authority over the girl, and that her indentures had not been enrolled at the beginning of her term. Having decided to examine Joan and Agnes separately, the court learnt that Agnes, who was still under age, had sealed the indentures at Christmas only because she was threatened with a beating, and that she would prefer to return to her father. She was therefore released from her indentures. If she was still under age (younger than fourteen) in 1417, then Agnes can have been only six or seven when first apprenticed to the Cellers in 1410.<h2>
<a name="Femaleservants"></a>Female servants</h2>Parents valued apprenticeship for their daughters because it provided girls with patrons and business contacts and secured for them status and authority within the working community. It was an investment for the future, raising the prospect of a &#145;better class&#146; of husband (probably a citizen of London), while enabling the woman thus trained to keep herself either within, or following, her marriage. Many more girls, however, would have worked as servants for an annual wage. Such women might or might not have lived in their employers' households, and their commitment would have been short-term, under arrangements rarely formalized in writing. Because the mayor and aldermen were not directly responsible for contracts between masters and servants, cases involving female servants rarely appear in the records of the city courts, but a few cases were brought by petition to the attention of the lord chancellor. Richard Swan (<i>d</i>. 1492), a prosperous London skinner, employed <a name="cosubject_75213"></a><span class="headword">Joan Chamberlain</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1504?) as his <span class="occ">servant</span> on a one-year contract. She complained to the chancellor that Swan had tried to make her work for him beyond the agreed year by withholding 10<i>s</i>. of the wages due to her. Describing herself on this occasion as &#145;of London, gentilwoman&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 1/61/377), she may have been the Joan Chamberlain, &#145;widow, citizen, brewer and freewoman&#146; who drew up her will in 1504  (Sharpe, 2.644). If so, her stand against her employer earlier in her career suggests that she was a woman of mettle, just as her will attests her business success&#151;it includes a bequest of &pound;20 to be held in trust for the marriage of her niece, then acting as Joan's own servant.<br>
<br>Masters, too, might feel aggrieved. <a name="cosubject_75214"></a><span class="headword">Alice Shevyngton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 15th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> had worked for William Gregory (probably a skinner) for three years on annual contracts and received 16<i>s</i>. per annum. But although Gregory paid her wages regularly, in the fourth year Alice absented herself from his household for days and weeks at a time, &#145;pretending herself to have connyng in the tretyng of sore ighen [eyes]&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 1/66/264). To prevent her master from taking action against her, Alice was herself suing him for debt, and such was her popularity in the community that Gregory doubted whether he would be able to secure a fair trial. It is not easy to understand why Gregory was so upset. He may have been old and ill, but he may also have resented Alice's independent stance. Servants might be of the same age as apprentices, but they could also be considerably older, and as such skilled, knowledgeable, married, and independent. Their relationship with their masters and mistresses was that of employer and employee, rather than that between a surrogate parent and child envisaged in apprentice indentures.<h2>
<a name="Femessoles"></a>Femes soles</h2>It was unusual for women in medieval London to remain unmarried. A married woman could choose to trade as a feme sole independently of her husband and thus take on her own apprentices, run her own business, lease property, and sue and be sued for debt. But both husband and wife had to be free of the city. Both as wives and as widows women claimed to be freewomen of the city, with a status that carried privileges both within the city and further afield. The earliest reference to a widow identifying herself thus occurs in the will of <a name="cosubject_75215"></a><span class="headword">Katherine Pole</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1387)<span class="occ"></span>, drawn up in July 1387, where she is described as a &#145;citizen and freewoman of the city of London&#146;  (Sharpe, 2.263). Katherine was the daughter of Richard Lacer, mercer and mayor of London, and had married a London citizen, John Pole. Both her father and her husband appear to have died in the plague year of 1361. Katherine, together with her sister Alice, was later in dispute with her father's executors about the administration of his estate, and she may have asserted her status as a freewoman in her will in order to make more secure her bequest of a tenement to Elsyngspital at Cripplegate.<br>
<br>It may have been that women only really needed to trade as femes soles when they chose to follow crafts different from those of their husbands, since if they followed the same craft it would have been difficult to distinguish the trade of one from that of the other. Many of the women who brewed as femes soles, for instance, were married to men who practised other crafts. Where a woman is found as a feme sole following the same craft as her husband it is usually as a widow who has taken over her husband's business. <a name="cosubject_75216"></a><span class="headword">Mary Lodewyk</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1407)<span class="occ"></span>, the widow of the London tallow-chandler Robert Lodewyk, who had died in 1406, described herself in her own will, drawn up in the following year, as <i>libera</i> of the city of London. To her apprentice Andrew she left the moulds for making white and green candles with other tools, and also a covered cup decorated with popinjays. She was also able to make substantial bequests to her sister and goddaughter, to her servants, to a range of individuals including &#145;Alice nedilwyfe&#146; and &#145;Florence, a poor woman&#146;  (commissary will, Guildhall MS 9171/2, fol. 98), and to anchorites.<br>
<br>Women who traded as femes soles are most visible when they were sued for debt. At the time that her husband Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1395) was serving as an alderman <a name="cosubject_75217"></a><span class="headword">Maud Ireland</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1380)<span class="occ"></span> traded as a feme sole and &#145;according to the usage of the city is bound to answer her own contracts&#146;  (CLRO, mayor's court files, 1/123); in January 1380 she was sued for a debt of &pound;4 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. owed to Bartholomew Beauvais for white silk bought for her by her servant Alice Waldene. <a name="cosubject_75218"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Houghton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1441)<span class="occ"></span>, whose husband, John, was the city's water bailiff between 1431 and 1444, traded <i>sole</i> as a shepster (a cutter of clothes, or dressmaker), and in 1441 was sued by the mercer William Thornhill, for 8<i>s</i>. owed for woollen cloth. But some women made a public statement of their <i>sole</i> status. On 15 November 1457 <a name="cosubject_75219"></a><span class="headword">Isabelle Sayer</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1473)<span class="occ"></span> came before the mayor and aldermen and said that she practised the art of a silkwoman and no other, and asked to be allowed to &#145;merchandise&#146; without her husband, and to answer <i>sole</i> for her own contracts according to city custom. This was granted and entered as a record. Some time later Isabelle seems to have left the city and moved to West Bedfont in Stanwell, Middlesex, where she drew up her modest but self-sufficient will in 1473. She left the residue of her goods to her son William but made no mention of a husband. By her craft she had been able to maintain her independence and make bequests to the parish church, to various lights there, and to the fraternity of the Virgin.<br>
<br>Most of the women who appeared in the mayor's court to answer pleas of debt were probably doing business on quite a small scale. They may none the less have been able to read and write. There is good evidence that London women could write English, and doubtless read it also. <a name="cosubject_75220"></a><span class="headword">Joan Coggenhoe</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1423)<span class="occ"></span> was sufficiently skilled at writing to be able to forge a deed, and was consequently condemned to stand next to the pillory (not actually in it because she was too old), while a text of her forgery, together with an explanation of Joan's crime, was to be hung around her neck. There is a presumption in this case, as in that of the procuress Alison Boston, that those who saw these women in the pillory would be able to read the accounts of their offences that were displayed with them. And the groups that gathered round such ill doers in the market place would certainly have included women, at whom these deterrent accounts would have been particularly directed.<h2>
<a name="Businesswomenandmerchants"></a>Business women and merchants</h2>In the case of other women, whose business dealings were substantial, the presumption of literacy is even stronger. <a name="cosubject_75221"></a><span class="headword">Agnes Ramsey</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1399)<span class="occ"></span>, the daughter of the famous master mason <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37883/', "William Ramsey")</script>, and whose husband, Robert Huberd, was also a mason, ran her father's business after his death in 1349, and drew up a contract with Edward II's widow, Queen Isabella, for the construction of Edward's tomb in the London Greyfriars at a cost of over &pound;100. Styled &#145;Domina Agnes Ramsey&#146; in the accounts from 1377 of the fraternity of the Holy Trinity in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate (where her father's workshop and her own was situated), Agnes continued to collect her father's debts and to engage in property transactions until 1399. <a name="cosubject_75222"></a><span class="headword">Matilda Penne</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1392/3)<span class="occ"></span> as the widow of a skinner ran her late husband William's business for twelve years after his death. From her shop in Wood Street she maintained contacts with other citizens engaged in the clothing trade, and there she trained her own apprentices and employed male servants (and also, perhaps, a female scrivener to keep the accounts). A woman of convinced piety, she based her religious life upon St Peter's Church, Wood Street, and it was there that she required to be buried. In her will, drawn up on 4 November 1392 and proved on 3 February 1393, Matilda remembered forty-three people, twenty men and twenty-three women, ranging from the wives of city aldermen to monks of Westminster Abbey to little-known neighbours. Disposing of cash bequests totalling between &pound;60 and &pound;70, and of valuable plate and furnishings, it is a document that testifies both to her independence and to her success in trading as &#145;a woman skinner, a shopkeeper and craftswoman in her own right&#146;  (Veale, 54).<br>
<br>The workshops of founders (who made brass pots as well as church bells) were quite often managed by women. Twice during the fifteenth century the notable bell foundry outside Aldgate was run by widows who added a distinctive lozenge to the mark of their late husbands to signify the change of management. One of these was <a name="cosubject_75223"></a><span class="headword">Joan Hill</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1441)<span class="occ"></span>, whose husband, Richard Hill, cast bells that still survive in churches in eleven counties, from Cornwall to Rutland. When he died in 1440 Joan took over the business, for instance entering into a contract with the parishioners of Faversham to cast five new bells for their church and to remake any bells found to be defective. In her own will, made less than a year later, Joan made bequests to four male apprentices, two female servants, six male servants, four further men whose tasks were not specified, a specialized &#145;bell-maker&#146;, a clerk, and the daughter of another founder. She left her bell-making equipment to her daughter, another Joan, and the latter's husband, Henry Jordan, and clearly expected that they would carry on the business. <a name="cosubject_75224"></a><span class="headword">Joan Reynold</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1483)<span class="occ"></span> was the widow of Robert Reynold, a master of the craft who had died in 1476. She continued to run the business for another six years and in her will made bequests of tools to named servants and apprentices. Whereas her husband gave a maser weighing 9 ounces to the Founders' Company, Joan gave a double cup with a handle &#145;over gilted&#146; weighing twice as much. These and others like them were remarkable women, who made their mark in the commercial world of London and won respect within their social milieux.<h2>
<a name="Womeninthecompaniesandinpublicoffice"></a>Women in the companies and in public office</h2>The surviving records of the craft guilds and companies acknowledge the presence of women within the craft structure, but their role was not a formal one. Much of the evidence relates to women sharing in the religious, charitable, and social aspects of company life. The Skinners prayed for dead sisters as well as brothers of the craft, and the ordinances of many crafts and companies refer to sisters as well as brothers. Women who prospered through their links with the crafts remembered the latter in their wills. <a name="cosubject_75225"></a><span class="headword">Joan Bradbury</span>  (<em>c.</em>1450&#150;1530)<span class="occ"></span> married as her second husband the mercer Thomas Bradbury. It was probably with her encouragement that he started to become closely involved in the government of the city, culminating in his election as mayor in 1509. His death in office early in 1510 led to his widow's endowing a perpetual chantry for his soul (and also for that of her first husband, Thomas Bodley (<i>d</i>. 1492), a merchant tailor) in the church of St Stephen, Coleman Street. The Mercers' Company agreed to act as its trustees, and in return Joan gave her &#145;great house&#146; in Cheapside for use as the company hall. A woman of strong personality and considerable managerial abilities, her charitable activities extended to the endowment of a grammar school at Walden, Essex, where her brother was vicar. But although it is clear that the social activities of the companies included women&#151;the Mercers several times held their St Thomas's tide banquet in Joan Bradbury's house before it was finally conveyed to them&#151;the participation of women in the craft and trade organization of London was not confined solely to their charitable and social functions. Many guilds acknowledged that it was desirable to encourage widows to continue to maintain the workshops or businesses of their dead husbands and to train their apprentices. It is apparent that tanners left the tools of their craft, and their stalls in the establishment known as the Tanner's Seld, to their widows almost always in trust for their children, or on condition that these widows married within the craft: they were guardians of a communal resource.<br>
<br>In the fifteenth century, when labour was scarce, crafts and trades recognized, albeit grudgingly, the presence of women workers within their guilds and companies. In this respect the Brewers' Company may, however, have been unusual; in the early fifteenth century a third of all brewers paying quarterage to the company were women. <a name="cosubject_75226"></a><span class="headword">Agnes Bugge</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1417&#150;1430)<span class="occ"></span>, the wife of the draper Stephen Bugge, paid her dues independently to the Brewers' Company throughout the 1420s. When Stephen died in 1428&#150;30 he bequeathed &#145;his&#146; brewhouse to his widow, and in law it was undoubtedly his property, yet it is clear that it was she who had been the brewer while he was active as a draper. Agnes's success in her profession may be deduced from her response to the &#145;voluntary assessment&#146; whereby in 1419/20 the brewers raised money to fund a dispute with the city authorities; at 20<i>s</i>. hers was the largest single contribution. Companies that recognized the existence of women workers over and above the wives and daughters sometimes specified in their ordinances were, nevertheless, apt to restrict their access to craft skills. If women sometimes flourished as traders and artisans, this owed much to their ability to create informal networks of female friends, servants, apprentices, daughters, dependants, and patrons, networks that supplemented the formal craft relationships. In the same way women very seldom held public office, in the sense of office in which they might have been placed in authority over a man. It was exceptional that in 1372 women were sworn alongside their husbands to supervise the dyeing of leather.<br>
<br>In 1422 the jurors of Queenhythe complained that the official measurer of oysters, John Ely, had farmed his office to women &#145;who know not [how to do it]; nor is it worship to this city that women should have such things in governance&#146;  (Thomas and Jones, 3.138&#150;9). In spite of this attitude there were occasions when widows were allowed to carry on their husbands' official posts. <a name="cosubject_75227"></a><span class="headword">Katherine Bury</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1346&#150;1348?)<span class="occ"></span>, whose husband, Walter, had been the king's smith at the Tower, where he was succeeded by his son Andrew, was paid 8<i>d</i>. a day to &#145;keep up the king's forge in the Tower and carry on the work of the forge&#146; while her son was away on the Cr&eacute;cy campaign  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1345&#150;8</i>, 131). She may well have been the Katherine <i>fabra</i> who in 1348 was paid for refurbishing the masons' tools at Westminster. Even more strikingly, <a name="cosubject_75228"></a><span class="headword">Alice Holford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1455)<span class="occ"></span> acted as bailiff of London Bridge for over twenty years after the death of her husband, Nicholas, &#145;citizen and textwriter&#146;, in 1434. The bailiff collected the tolls due from boats passing through the bridge and from carts crossing over it into London, a complicated task since the charges varied according to the goods and the person transporting them. In her will, drawn up in May 1455, Alice left a missal (which may have been the work of her late husband) for the chapel on the bridge, but only on condition that the master and bridgewards granted the house in which she had lived there to her son Nicholas, at the same rent (32<i>s</i>. per annum) that she had paid. The bridgewards were also to pay 5 marks to her executors. In a world in which masculine control was usually taken for granted, the firm, almost commanding, tone of Alice's will suggests a woman confident of her authority and bargaining power.<br>
