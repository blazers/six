<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry</span>, fourth earl of Northumberland  (<em>c.</em>1449&#150;1489), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21934/', "Henry Percy, third earl of Northumberland (1421&#150;1461)")</script>, and his wife, Eleanor, Baroness Poynings (1428&#150;1484). Despite their reputation as the leading northern family, rivalled only by the Nevilles of Middleham, the Percys had still not entirely recovered from the reverses they suffered between 1403 and 1408, when in 1461 the third earl died fighting for the Lancastrians at Towton. He was attainted by the victorious Yorkists, and in 1464 the forfeited earldom and most of the Percy estates were conferred on the earl of Warwick's brother, John Neville, Lord Montagu, in reward for his recent victories over the Lancastrians. Lord Percy, as Henry was called, was then confined in the Fleet, attended by four servants; by 1468 he was the ward of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13053/', "William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke (d. 1469)")</script>, whose daughter Maud (<i>d</i>. in or before 1485) he later married (<i>c</i>.1476). Probably only the breach between Edward IV and the Nevilles allowed the future fourth earl to rebuild the fortunes of his family, though the difficulties facing any government that tried to rule the north of England without the Percys were also a significant factor in Henry Percy's recovery of his earldom. Following renewed disturbances in the north, which were accompanied by a demand for his restoration as earl, Henry Percy was released from the Tower of London on 27 October 1469 and did homage to Edward IV at Westminster. During March 1470 the Percy estates in Northumberland were restored to him following their surrender, with the earldom, by John Neville, who was promoted instead to be Marquess Montagu; and on the 25th, after Warwick's flight, Henry Percy was created earl of Northumberland, with custody of his father's estates elsewhere. On 24 June he was appointed to the wardenship of the east and middle marches, an office traditionally held by the Percys.<br>
<br>Percy retained his earldom during the readeption of Henry VI in 1470&#150;71, though displaced from his warden's office by Montagu, and he played a crucial role in Edward's recovery of his crown. Challenged after his landing at Ravenspur, Edward replied &#145;that he came thedere by the Erle of Northumberlondes avyse, and schewede the Erles lettere y-send to hym&#146;  (Warkworth, 14). The earl then sat still, so doing Edward &#145;a notable good service&#146;, since &#145;grete partye of [the] noble men and comons in thos parties [which] were towards th'Erle of Northumberland, and would not stire with any [other] lorde&#146; did likewise, despite their Lancastrian loyalties and bitter memories of kinsfolk killed at Towton.  (<span class="italic">Historie of the Arrivall</span>, 6&#150;7). The earl's reward, given on 12 June 1471, was restoration as march warden, initially for five years, and appointment as justice of the forests beyond Trent and constable of Bamburgh for life. His father's attainder was reversed in the parliament of 1472, and during 1474 he received life grants of other key border offices, as constable of Newcastle and sheriff of Northumberland, while his election as a knight of the Garter attested his favour at court. In 1475 he accompanied Edward IV to France, serving with 10 knights, 50 esquires, and 350 archers, and was present at Edward's interview with Louis XI at Picquigny. And in 1482 he raised 6000 men and commanded the van in Richard of Gloucester's invasion of Scotland.<br>
<br>Apart from a few months immediately after Henry Tudor's accession Northumberland controlled the wardenship of the east and middle marches for the rest of his life. The extent and strategic location of the Percy estates explain their central importance to the earl. The terms of his restoration had been generous, giving him a relatively compact lordship initially worth approximately &pound;3200 a year gross, all but &pound;400 coming from Yorkshire and the border counties of Northumberland and Cumberland. Yet border estates also needed defending against Scottish incursions and the depredations of the borderland's reiving clans. In the 1470s the earl appointed itinerant commissioners to tighten estate administration, and he also made intermittent efforts to exploit their mineral resources. The terms on which he held the wardenship gradually deteriorated, but new lands worth almost &pound;800 per annum which he inherited in the south in 1484 and 1488 compensated for this financially, without much altering the geographical balance of his estates.<br>
<br>Throughout Edward's second reign, however, Northumberland was overshadowed in northern government by the king's younger brother, Richard, duke of Gloucester, warden of the west marches, and inheritor of the Neville interest and estates. Initially the earl attempted to compete by building up his connection, but the threat posed by the duke's superior resources was underlined by Gloucester's retaining of John Widdrington of Chipchase, the earl's master forester of Alnwick, and by his displacement of the earl as justice of the forests beyond Trent in 1472. An unsuccessful attempt at mediation by the king's council in 1473, and the well-known indenture between duke and earl in 1474, seeking to limit their rivalry and safeguard the peace, shows Northumberland on the defensive. In effect Northumberland was obliged in the indenture to become Gloucester's &#145;faithful servant&#146;  (de Fonblanque) in return for assurances that the duke should neither retain any of the earl's servants, nor claim any office or fee which Northumberland had of the king. The agreement was flexibly observed by both parties: the earl was unchallenged in Northumberland, where he continued to fee the leading gentry, and in north Durham too, but in the west he granted no new fees. In Yorkshire the earl dominated the East Riding, where he had most land, while North Riding gentry mostly followed Gloucester. Relations between the two magnates were apparently amicable too, as was attested by their co-operation during the Scottish war of 1480&#150;83. Although Gloucester was appointed king's lieutenant, and so given general precedence in the north, after the recovery of Berwick it was the earl who received command of this key outpost; and initially, too, he had the gift of 600 places in the garrison, at a cost of &pound;438 per month.<br>
<br>Northumberland's support for Gloucester was crucial in providing the military muscle behind the latter's coup in June 1483. The earl raised troops in his own territory, particularly the East Riding, and had command of the northern army which backed Richard's claim to the throne. He bore the curtana, the blunt sword which was the emblem of royal mercy, at Richard III's coronation; and once Richard was established at Westminster, Northumberland no doubt hoped to take over his role as king's lieutenant in the north. He was to be disappointed. The earl was handsomely rewarded for his support, with the title of great chamberlain of England and probably the most valuable land grant (approximately &pound;1500 per annum) of the reign. But a third of this land (by value) was the Brian estate in the south-west, which the earl claimed through his mother; and in political terms the forfeited Stafford lordship of Holderness merely complemented his existing East Riding possessions. In Northumberland he continued to act as warden, albeit from year to year, but any expansion of Percy influence in the region was checked by Richard's decision to retain direct control of the north through his ducal household and council there, headed successively by his son and his nephew. Moreover, the king's local knowledge, his continuing reliance on his northern affinity, and his more attractive lordship, probably meant that Northumberland's position was now even weaker. Several Percy associates entered the king's household, accounting for about one-eighth of his known knights.<br>
<br>As in 1471, therefore, circumstances again prompted Northumberland to place personal interests before the loyalties and expectations of his retainers. Perhaps calculating that an inexperienced king without other supporters in the north would allow him the regional hegemony Richard had withheld&#151;and perhaps also in accordance with an earlier undertaking to Henry Tudor&#151;Northumberland brought a large army to Bosworth but then once more sat still, so keeping his retainers, and probably many of Richard's northern supporters, out of the battle. In the short term this strategy proved successful. Richard III was defeated and killed, and although Northumberland was briefly imprisoned after Bosworth, lack of support in the north soon forced Henry VII to restore the earl&#151;albeit, in effect, on probation. The earl lacked connections at the new king's court, but again built up his regional affinity: by 1489 he was retaining eighty-four lords, knights and esquires, and spending &pound;1708 a year (42 per cent of his income) on fees to officials and retainers. And over the next three years he repaid Henry's confidence in him with unswerving loyalty as king's lieutenant in a hostile north. In April 1486 he brought a powerful retinue, including thirty-three knights, to escort the king into York at the time of Lovell's rebellion. In June 1487 he reacted promptly to Lambert Simnel's invasion, organizing York's defence, and raising 6700 men to hold the north-east against the rebels. And in April 1489, upon news of a tax rising in Cleveland, he summoned his retainers to come with &#145;bowes &amp; arrowes &amp; pryvy harnest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plumpton Letters</span>, no. 74) and set out to enforce collection.<br>
<br>Yet Northumberland's equivocal conduct at Bosworth was widely seen as treachery; many northerners suffered in the ensuing political reaction against the followers of Richard III; and subsequently the earl's energetic enforcement of Tudor policy in the region marked him as the leading instrument of an unpopular regime. These developments so undermined the earl's standing among his retainers that they failed to protect him, instead leaving him to be killed when he confronted a mob of protesters at South Kilvington, just outside Thirsk, on 28 April. In John Skelton's words:<blockquote>
<div>Barons, knightis, squyers, one and alle,<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; Turnd ther backis and let ther master fall,<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; Alas his golde, his fee, his annuall rente,<br>
</div>
<div>Upon suche a sort was ille bestowde and spent.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">John Skelton: the Complete English Poems</span>, 31&#150;2)</blockquote>Northumberland was buried as he had requested in Beverley Minster, after a lavish funeral costing &pound;1037. His wife had died before 1485, but he was survived by their four sons and three daughters, of whom the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21936/', "Henry Algernon Percy")</script>, succeeded his father as fifth earl. Their third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21922/', "Alan Percy")</script>, became master of St John's College, Cambridge.<br>
