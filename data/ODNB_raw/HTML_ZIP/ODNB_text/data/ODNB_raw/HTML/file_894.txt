<span class="headword">Audley,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1272), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/892/', "Henry Audley")</script> and Bertred, daughter of Ralph Mainwaring, county justice of Chester. He had paid homage to Henry III for his father's lands by 19 November 1246. He had one brother, Ralph (<i>d</i>. before 1240), and his sister Alice married Peter de Montfort. In 1244 Audley married Ela (<i>d</i>. 1299) daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16984/', "William (II) Longesp&#233;e (c.1209&#150;1250)")</script>, claimant to the earldom of Salisbury and cousin of Henry III. The couple had five sons, James, Henry, William, Nicholas, and Hugh, who succeeded to the family estates, which were overwhelmingly concentrated in Staffordshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire.<br>
<br>Audley's service to the crown began in 1250, when he was appointed keeper of the town and castle of Newcastle under Lyme, and was commissioned to settle a dispute in the Welsh marches concerning Fulk Fitzwarine and Thomas Corbet. Similar commissions followed in the next few years. On 29 April 1257 he accompanied Richard, earl of Cornwall, at his coronation as king of the Romans at Aachen. The Welsh took advantage of his absence and ravaged his estates, but he exacted particularly savage retribution on his return, around Michaelmas 1257. Audley's regional power and closeness to the royal family help to explain the more significant role that he played in the following turbulent decade. He was one of the royalist members of the council of fifteen appointed to advise Henry III in accordance with the provisions of Oxford (1258), and witnessed the king's confirmation of their powers on 18 October 1258. However, his involvement in marcher affairs, as relations with the Welsh deteriorated and as the situation in the marches became more volatile, largely accounts for the limited role that he played in purely English affairs in the next few years. In particular he was appointed in November 1259 to visit Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire with Giles of Erdington, as part of the general eyre stipulated in the provisions of Westminster (October 1259), but after duly visiting Northamptonshire he was replaced by Philip Marmion. Already, in 1258, he had been commissioned to arrange a truce with Llywelyn and to settle disputes; in June 1259 he was sent to prolong the truce and negotiate a peace; and in 1260, 1262, 1263, and 1265 he was employed in further negotiations. As the rule of the baronial council disintegrated, Audley emerged as a leading royalist partisan in the Welsh marches. In May 1261 he was appointed keeper of Bridgnorth and Shrewsbury castles and in July he was made sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire. He met with some considerable resistance, and in 1262 his lands were seized by the rebels. They were restored in late 1263 on his agreeing to uphold the provisions of Oxford. In August 1263 he was removed by the baronial party from the two shrievalties, but in December 1263 he was appointed a royal <i>custos pacis</i> (keeper of the peace) in the two counties. He was one of the royalists who swore (16 December 1263) to uphold Louis IX of France's judgment in the quarrel between Henry III and the baronial party. He fought for the king at Northampton (6 April 1264) and at Lewes (14 May), where he was captured. He was quickly released, but with most of his fellow marchers he refused to attend the parliament summoned in early July. When Simon de Montfort marched against them, they were forced to submit, and Audley was obliged to hand over his son Nicholas as a hostage (25 August 1264). He remained in arms in support of the royalist cause, establishing close relations with the Lord Edward in this critical period. After the battle of Evesham he acted as Edward's justiciar for Chester (1265&#150;7).<br>
<br>Audley almost certainly went on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1268, and as a crusader he received a judicial protection on 10 July 1270 to accompany the Lord Edward to the Holy Land. But he never went, as he was appointed Edward's justiciar for Ireland on or before 8 August. He held the post until his death in Ireland, which resulted from a broken neck, on or about 11 June 1272. He was succeeded by his son James, who did homage on 29 July 1272.<br>
