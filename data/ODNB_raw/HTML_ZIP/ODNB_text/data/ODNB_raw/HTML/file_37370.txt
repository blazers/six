<span class="headword">Drake,  Judith</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1696&#150;1723), <span class="occ">writer and medical practitioner</span>, was the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8026/', "James Drake (bap. 1666, d. 1707)")</script>, physician and political writer. Although no marriage is traceable the register of St Andrew's, Holborn, records the baptism of &#145;Ann daughter of James Drake and Judith&#146;. It was probably from James Drake, a fellow of the Royal Society and of the College of Physicians, that she acquired her medical knowledge. In 1723, summoned to appear before Sir Hans Sloane, president of the Royal College of Physicians, she defended herself against accusations of medical malpractice made by &#145;a malicious informant&#146;. Apparently she regularly dispensed medicines to &#145;those not in acute distempers&#146; among her &#145;own sex and little children&#146;. She little suspected that this would make her &#145;obnoxious to the censure of the College&#146;. The complainant had made no objection &#145;against the price (which he all along knew) nor the success of the medicines, till they came to be pay'd for&#146;. He had accused her of administering poisons, but, as she retorted, &#145;the only poison &hellip; administered was to his Ears&#151;in a demand for money&#146;. Since he had made the accusation his mistress had three times sent for more medicines. As Drake commented, &#145;when a man permits that to be taken by his Friend which he calls poison, he must not wonder if we reflect upon him for want of sense or sincerity&#146;  (Sloane MS 4047, fol. 38).<br>
<br>Drake is best known for her probable authorship of the anonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">An Essay in Defence of the Female Sex</span> (1696), frequently ascribed to Mary Astell. It was included in a catalogue of second-hand books sold after 1741 by the publisher Edmund Curll, where it was described as written by &#145;Mrs. Drake, probably a sister of Dr. James Drake, who attended to the publication of the pamphlet&#146;  (F. M. Smith, appendix). The author's preface refers to &#145;the gentleman, who was so kind as to take care of the Publication of it, only to excuse me from appearing&#146;. &#145;The same gentleman&#146; persuaded her not to put her name to the pamphlet for fear of the malice of men who &#145;greedily &hellip; suck in anything to the prejudice of A Woman&#146;. She wrote that there were &#145;some Men, (I hear) who will not allow this Piece to be written by a Woman&#146;. The true author, they held, was James Drake. She saw no reason why her sex &#145;shou'd be robb'd of the Honour of it, since there have been Women in all Ages whose Writings might vie with those of the greatest Men&#146;  (Drake, <span class="italic">Essay in Defence of the Female Sex</span>). James Drake in the preface wrote an elegant poem in praise of his wife's work.<br>
<br>Written in a lively and witty style, Drake's pamphlet defends women against the accusations of vanity, impertinence, enviousness, dissimulation, and inconstancy which men make against them. In satirical sketches of the Scholar, the Country Squire, the Beau, the Virtuoso, the Poet, and the Coffee-house Politicians she revealed the weaknesses of men. While admitting to &#145;a very great Veneration&#146; for the Royal Society in general, she thought there was &#145;a vast difference between the particular Members&#146;. She attacked the &#145;<i>Mushrome</i> and <i>Cockel-shell</i> Hunters&#146;. What &#145;noble Remedies, what serviceable Instruments&#146; had they produced to equal &#145;so good a Med'cine as Stew'd <i>Prunes</i>, or so necessary an Instrument as a <i>Flye-Flap</i>&#146;? She argued that women by nature were no less talented than men. &#145;Never design'd for Fatigue&#146;, they were &#145;chiefly intended for Thought and the Exercise of the Mind&#146;. Men's physical strength made them more fitted &#145;for Action and Labour&#146;  (Drake, <span class="italic">Essay</span>, 18). Aware of women's potential to &#145;become their Superiours&#146; men had denied them access to education  (ibid., 21). She had sharp words for those men who believed time spent in women's company was &#145;mis'employ'd&#146;  (ibid., 6) but admitted that among the &#145;inferior sort&#146;, &#145;the Condition of the two Sexes&#146; was &#145;more level&#146; than among their social superiors  (ibid., 15&#150;16).<br>
<br>Drake appears to have abandoned writing after 1696, but when her husband died on 2 March 1707, having just completed his second volume of <span class="italic">Anthropologia Nova, or, A New System of Anatomy</span>, Judith published it, edited the text, and was responsible for the dedication to Henry, duke of Beaufort. In it she described herself as a &#145;Retir'd Disconsolate Woman, whose Great Misfortune it is that it was not offer'd to Your Grace by a better Hand&#146;.<br>
