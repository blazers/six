<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Charles</span>, third Earl Stanhope  (1753&#150;1816), <span class="occ">politician and inventor</span>, was born in London on 3 August 1753. He was the second, but only surviving, son of Philip Stanhope, second Earl Stanhope (1714&#150;1786), and his wife, Grizel Hamilton (1719&#150;1811). His father, the son of the general and whig politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26248/', "James Stanhope, first Earl Stanhope")</script>, was a relatively minor politician in the House of Lords but an accomplished mathematician and classical scholar. A fellow and benefactor of the Royal Society, he was a close friend of Robert Simson, professor of mathematics at Glasgow University and the dedicatee of the third volume of Joseph Priestley's <span class="italic">Experiments on Air</span>. Partly because of his political independence he was held in high regard by William Pitt the elder and by Benjamin Franklin. Lady Stanhope was the daughter of Charles Hamilton, Lord Binning, and Rachel Baillie, and sister of the seventh earl of Haddington.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Charles Stanhope was therefore bred to aristocratic society virtually from birth. He entered Eton College on 24 September 1761, shortly after his eighth birthday, and remained there for two years. His dame at Eton was Mrs Frances Yonge. His elder brother, Philip, suffered from tuberculosis and was sent to Geneva for the benefit of his health. However, he died there on 6 July 1763 and Charles assumed the courtesy title of Lord Mahon and became the heir to the earldom of Stanhope. The family lived at Geneva from July 1764 until 1774. At first the objective was to preserve Mahon's health, which, like that of his brother, was thought to be delicate, and the services of Dr Theodore Tronchin were obtained. Once it became clear that Mahon was in no danger of succumbing to any serious ailment his father decided to remain in Geneva, where he could enjoy intellectual exchanges with fellow mathematicians and arrange for his son to have expert tuition. Mahon received private instruction from Georges Le Sage and, despite his youth, was allowed to meet his father's friends as if he were an adult. The family would have nothing to do with Voltaire, but Mahon met Horace-Benedict de Saussure and in 1765 was frequently in the company of Adam Smith. It has been suggested, though not conclusively, that the Stanhopes in Geneva were engaged in an unofficial mission to observe the political situation, and to keep a watching brief on English commercial interests in the city  (Bennett, chap. 3). At all events Mahon quickly became involved in cultural and political activities which undoubtedly influenced his later career.<br>
<br>From 1771 Mahon began to spend more time with his Genevan friends. He belonged to a society of artists and such was his skill with the crossbow that he became &#145;king&#146;, or commander, of the archers. In this capacity he associated with a wider range of people than would have been the case had he experienced a full education at Eton. He was elected to the Council of Two Hundred. Though his involvement in Genevan politics was cautious, he made the acquaintance of, and sympathized with, those excluded from power, including the discontented <i>Natifs</i>. Several personal traits which characterized his later life were already apparent. His hostility to the theatre in Geneva, especially when comedy was performed, suggests a puritanical streak, while his physical awkwardness and indifference to dress and to such manifestations of elegance as hair powder led his mother to dub him &#145;the Quaker&#146;  (Newman, 131). He dabbled in scientific experimentation, invented a pyrometer, composed a paper on the pendulum, and wrote a volume recommending methods of preventing the fraudulent use of gold coins. In 1773 he was elected to the Royal Society.<h2>
<a name="Entryintopoliticsandfirstmarriage"></a>Entry into politics and first marriage</h2>In summer 1774 the family left Geneva and, after a brief sojourn in Paris, returned to England. In September Mahon was presented at court. On the dissolution of parliament he made his first attempt to enter parliament as a candidate for the city of Westminster, which, with some 12,000 voters, was the largest and most independent borough constituency in the country. He stood in the radical interest, supported by John Wilkes, with Lord Mountmorres and polled 2342 votes, but ended in fourth place. His candidature for Maidstone, when he challenged the Aylesbury interest in a by-election in 1777, was too brief for success. He had, however, attracted favourable comment from critics of Lord North's administration. Chatham observed &#145;Lord Mahon is himself a <i>Mine</i> richer than all&#146;  (Newman, 134). His connection with Chatham's family was cemented by his marriage, on 19 December 1774, to Lady Hester Pitt (1755&#150;1780), the eldest daughter of Chatham and his wife, Lady Hester Grenville; he thus became the brother-in-law of William Pitt the younger. Mahon and his wife had three daughters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26247/', "Hester Stanhope (1776&#150;1839)")</script>, Griselda (<i>b</i>. 1778), and Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1780), but his wife never fully recovered from the birth of the latter and died, apparently of dropsy, on 20 July 1780.<br>
<br>Mahon was identified in politics with Lord Chatham's small, though intellectually powerful, group of followers in opposition to North's policies, particularly over America. He was in attendance when Chatham collapsed following his last speech in the House of Lords on 7 April 1778. Thereafter he transferred his allegiance to the earl of Shelburne, who succeeded to the leadership of Chatham's group. In 1775 he had visited Shelburne and met Joseph Priestley and Richard Price, thus strengthening his affinities with radical dissenters. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the county association movement for economical and parliamentary reform in spring 1780 and formed a friendship with its most prominent spokesman Christopher Wyvill, whose Yorkshire Association had launched the movement. He helped to organize the petitions in Buckinghamshire and in Kent, where he was elected chairman of the committee of correspondence. He joined the Society for Constitutional Information shortly after its foundation in 1780. He strongly opposed the attempts of Lord George Gordon's Protestant Association to repeal the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> of 1778 and, according to Horace Walpole, &#145;laboured to pacify the tempest&#146; on 2 June 1780, prevailing upon at least one section of the rioters to disperse  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 25.54).<h2>
<a name="TheCommonsandsecondmarriage"></a>The Commons and second marriage</h2>At the general election held in autumn 1780 Shelburne brought Mahon into parliament without a contest for his pocket borough of Chipping Wycombe. Mahon was re-elected in 1784. He created an immediate impression in the House of Commons and made more than ninety speeches in his short career in the lower house. Persevering with one of his Genevan obsessions he took a particular interest in questions of currency, and subjected the financial policies of North, and even of Pitt, to critical scrutiny. His ungainly energy is said to have caused him inadvertently to strike Pitt on the head in the course of an enthusiastic declamation. Meanwhile, on 19 March 1781 he married as his second wife Louisa (1758&#150;1829), the daughter of Lady Chatham's younger brother, James Grenville, and Margaret Eleanor Banks. They had four sons, one of whom died in infancy; the eldest,<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60698/', "Philip Henry Stanhope (1781&#150;1855)")</script>, ultimately succeeded to the earldom [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26256/', "Stanhope, Philip Henry, fifth Earl Stanhope")</script>].<br>
<br>The fall of North's administration in March 1782 gave rise to a fluid and unstable parliamentary situation. Mahon gave cautious support to Shelburne's ministry (July 1782 to February 1793) and began a campaign for the reform of electoral law with the objective of placing a limit upon expenses and reducing corruption. In 1782 he introduced a bill to reduce electoral costs by allowing the sheriffs to move the place of polling to different locations within constituencies. When its key clause was defeated in committee Mahon withdrew the bill completely. In May 1783 he succeeded in steering a similar bill through the Commons but it was lost in the House of Lords. He gave full support to the parliamentary reform bills introduced by Pitt and vehemently opposed the Fox&#150;North coalition and in particular its <span class="roman">East India Bill</span>. When the coalition was dismissed by George III in December 1783 Mahon gave strong encouragement to the new and insecure ministry formed by Pitt, and indeed helped to stiffen the resolve of the new minister when the resignation of Lord Temple and the prospect of immediate defeat in the Commons led Pitt to consider the abandonment of the enterprise. When parliament was dissolved at the end of March 1784, however, it was clear that Pitt would survive, and Mahon threw himself eagerly into the general election campaign. In Buckinghamshire he addressed a meeting which voted an address of thanks to the crown with an outspoken attack on the <span class="roman">India Bill</span>: &#145;Why, says Mr Fox, give to me, and seven men named by me, two million sterling of annual patronage, and that shall be your remedy, God defend the Nation from such a remedy as that!&#146;  (Stanhope and Gooch, 59). He also took part in the unsuccessful campaign to secure the defeat of Fox in Westminster.<br>
<br>In the new parliament Mahon continued to give independent support to Pitt's ministry. Pitt consulted him over the proposal to reduce the tea duty in 1784. The following year he introduced a bill which would have established a register of voters in county constituencies in the hope of curbing fraudulent voting. It was carried in the Commons but fell foul of some of Pitt's own cabinet colleagues, notably Lord Thurlow, in the Lords. Mahon had voted for Pitt's own <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> on 18 April 1785. By this time he had acquired a reputation for a certain radical eccentricity and excessive optimism, both for his opinions and for the manner in which he expressed them.<h2>
<a name="TheLords"></a>The Lords</h2>On the death of his father (7 March 1786) Mahon succeeded as third Earl Stanhope. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 31 March. Almost immediately he introduced, in collaboration with William Wilberforce, a further bill for district polling. Like its predecessor of 1785 it was defeated in the Lords by what Wyvill termed &#145;a formidable coalition of the King's Friends and the Whig Aristocracy&#146;  (Ditchfield, &#145;House of Lords and parliamentary reform&#146;, 213). Although increasingly critical of Pitt's ministry, especially over financial policy, his previous record obstructed any co-operation with the opposition of Fox and Portland. None the less Stanhope enjoyed a moment of success in 1788 when he piloted a district polling bill into law. It provided for an electoral register in each county constituency. Stanhope canvassed assiduously in its favour and sought to meet some of the criticisms of his previous bills. But his success was short-lived, since a series of petitions from English counties, complaining that the costs of the registers would be borne by the county rate, led to the repeal of the act, untried in a general election, in 1789. Stanhope then abandoned his efforts to reform the electoral law.<br>
<br>During the later 1780s Stanhope renewed his connections with protestant dissent. He came to favour universal toleration, with a repeal of all discriminatory religious legislation. In 1789 he introduced into the Lords a bill to this effect, with the reluctant exclusion of Catholics from its benefits. Not surprisingly it encountered episcopal hostility, particularly from John Moore, archbishop of Canterbury, and Samuel Horsley. After a lengthy debate the bill was rejected without a division. Stanhope's pledge that &#145;if the right reverend Bench would not suffer him to load away their rubbish by cart-fulls, he would endeavour to carry it away in wheelbarrows, and if that mode of removal was resisted, he would take it, if possible, away with a spade, a little at a time&#146; and his claim to have &#145;taught the bench of bishops religion&#146;  (Debrett, 26.261, 262) only served to accentuate his public reputation as an obsessive crank, with an almost unlimited capacity to bore. Graphic satires depicted him as a rod-wielding schoolmaster. In private, however, Stanhope could be intellectually engaging, with genuine scientific interests which included fireproofing, calculating machines, and the development of lightning conductors. He addressed the Royal Society on the latter subject in February 1787. He also proved himself accessible to those outside the political &eacute;lite. In 1789 he held detailed consultations with representatives of the Society of Friends, and as a result introduced (June 1789) a bill to relieve Quakers from the more burdensome consequences of non-payment of tithes. By this time Stanhope's anti-clerical motivation was plainly in evidence, and the <span class="roman">Quaker Bill</span>, now associated with a more general threat to the Church of England, was summarily dismissed in the House of Lords.<h2>
<a name="CitizenStanhope"></a>Citizen Stanhope</h2>Stanhope had moved away from support of Pitt's administration some years before the start of the French Revolution. Indeed, Pitt, like Stanhope himself, was no sympathizer with the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> in France. But the wider ramifications of the Revolution caused a breach in their relations. Stanhope became chairman of the Revolution Society, founded to commemorate the centenary of the events of 1688, and renewed his friendship with Richard Price. He defended the latter against the strictures of Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections</span> in <span class="italic">A Letter from Earl Stanhope to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke</span> (1790) and was praised by Catharine Macaulay as &#145;a patriot, a philosopher, and the firm friend of the general rights of man&#146;  (Macaulay, 5). He endorsed the address of congratulations from the Revolution Society to the French people on the fall of the Bastille and in letters to Condorcet and Rochefoucault, some of which were published, he expressed strong approval of the early stages of the Revolution. Even when he withdrew from the Revolution Society it was over a matter of personal pique rather than any difference of political sentiments. His libertarian reputation was enhanced by his support for the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> of 1791 and his energetic defence of the relaxation of the law of libel which took legislative form in Fox's <span class="roman">Libel Act</span> of 1792. He published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Rights of Juries Defended</span> (1792), which drew admiring letters from sympathizers such as Wyvill and Bishop Richard Watson. At the same time he was &#145;deeply occupied&#146; with his &#145;great project&#146;, the construction of a form of steamship; its importance, in his eyes, was increased by the prospect that it would bring Britain and France, under its new regime, closer together  (Newman, 152&#150;3).<br>
<br>The outbreak of war between Britain and revolutionary France in February 1793 marked a decisive change in Stanhope's political career. A little earlier Stanhope had been asked by Talleyrand, the British envoy in London, to obtain British arbitration between France and Austria in the hope of avoiding a general European conflict. Grenville, the foreign secretary, and Pitt discountenanced the idea. Stanhope consistently opposed the French war as unjust and inexpedient. On 1 February 1793 he told the House of Lords &#145;You will not make this a war of the people of Great Britain&#146;, adding &#145;it is a war of the Government of England against the funds of England, against her paper currency, against her best and dearest interests&#146;. He argued that &#145;The real motives for this war is that you dislike the principles of the French Revolution. If these principles are good, it is not your war that will extinguish them&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 30, 1792&#150;4, 323). His amendment urging the king to seek every means to avoid war was negatived without a division. Stanhope was now increasingly perceived as a dangerous fanatic rather than a relatively harmless eccentric. As early as December 1790 Horace Walpole had described Stanhope's <span class="italic">Letter to Burke</span> as &#145;the ravings of a lunatic, imagining he could set the world on fire with phosphorus&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 34.98). The reference to a chemical process was not accidental, and Stanhope was soon linked with Joseph Priestley as a theological heterodox and politically dangerous menace. Indeed he employed one of Priestley's fellow Unitarians, the Revd Jeremiah Joyce, as tutor to his sons. Joyce shared Stanhope's political opinions and in May 1794 was arrested at Chevening on a charge of treasonable practices. When Joyce was released in the following December without being charged Stanhope held a large public entertainment in celebration; the songs, toasts to liberty, and dancing continued through the night.<br>
<br>On 23 January 1794 Stanhope moved in the House of Lords a motion to recognize the French republic and in the following April moved that there should be no British interference in the internal affairs of France. Much of his opposition to the war was based on an oft-repeated assertion of the liberty of the French people to determine their own form of government. He spoke against the suspension of habeas corpus, criticized the <span class="roman">Treasonable Practices</span> and <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings</span> Bills and, with Lauderdale, called for a review of the trials of T. F. Palmer and Thomas Muir. In this spirit he supported the London Corresponding Society and adopted the sobriquet Citizen Stanhope; as late as 1804 he was still signing letters with this appellation. Although his radical principles never extended to abandoning his own privileges and property, he was fond of symbolic gestures such as the removal of the coronets from the gates at Chevening. Horace Walpole relished the idea of &#145;a detachment of <i>poissardes</i> on the road to Chevening to create Earl Stanhope no peer!&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 11.97). Stanhope's isolation among the political &eacute;lite was now almost complete; in 1794 most of the Portland whigs joined in coalition with Pitt's government, while the few remaining Foxites found him too disreputable and unreliable an ally. Stanhope responded by writing a series of protests in the House of Lords, to which he was the only signatory. Hence there emerged his image as the minority of one, enshrined in a medal of that title which was by no means unflattering to its subject; its obverse declared him a &#145;friend of trial by jury, liberty of the press, parliamentary reform&#146; and other radical causes  (Newman, 158). In 1798 he was even suspected of association with Arthur O'Connor, the &#145;United Irishman&#146; arrested at Margate in 1798. Three years earlier he had seceded from the House of Lords in frustration, and did not resume attending until February 1800, although in the previous year he had written <span class="italic">An Address to the Nations of Great Britain and Ireland on the Projected Union</span>, a proposal which he opposed.<br>
<br>Stanhope continued in his single-handed motions for peace, but by this time was more occupied with opposition to the slave trade, a subject on which he found himself in unwonted harmony with much of the political nation. He was among the strongest advocates of the abolition bill which was passed in 1807. He never abandoned his libertarian principles, criticizing the <span class="roman">Indictment Bill</span> of 1808 and introducing a new <span class="roman">Toleration Bill</span> into the House of Lords in 1812. Although the latter was defeated a more effectively promoted measure, securing the repeal of the <span class="roman">Five Mile and Conventicle Acts</span>, was carried in the same year under the leadership of William Smith MP. Stanhope even achieved some success with his financial proposals. In 1811 cases of forgery and fears of depreciation led him to sponsor a bill to make it illegal for guineas to be sold at more than 21<i>s</i>., and for paper money to be accepted at less than its face value. The bill was accepted by the ministry and became law. At the same time he used his position in the Lords to table motions urging a uniform system of weights and measures, and opposing the imposition of the corn duty in 1815. The rejection of the latter gave rise to the last of his long sequence of Lords' protests.<h2>
<a name="Inventions"></a>Inventions</h2>At no time did Stanhope relinquish his interest in scientific discovery and technological invention. He was far more than an amateur dabbler in these areas. He registered patents for steamships in 1790 and in 1807, had some of his designs accepted by the Admiralty in 1795&#150;6, and consulted Boulton and Watt over developing steam-powered propulsion. He arranged for an engine to be constructed by his own engineer, Robert Walker, and persuaded the Admiralty to build a vessel, the <i>Kent</i>, to his specifications. He agreed to enter into a bond of &pound;6000 to be forfeited in the event of the ship's failure. It was to have no masts or sails and to be powered by a vibrator, a mechanically driven &#145;self-feathering paddle&#146;  (Newman, 174), but its sea trials in March 1797 did not justify the new technology and the Admiralty discontinued the experiment. His other main experiment in the design of a ship, the <i>Weatherer</i>, met a similar fate in 1808 and 1813, while his scheme for a floating mine to be used as a weapon against hostile fleets did not materialize. Although still an advocate of a negotiated peace, Stanhope entertained less sympathy with Napoleonic than with revolutionary France and saw no inconsistency between his political opinions and designing weapons of war for the British armed forces.<br>
<br>From about 1800 Stanhope took up an interest in the technology of printing, notably by devising a new printing press which bore his name, by developing a form of stereotyping and by introducing a system of logotypes. The latter proved a failure, but his stereotyping was taken up both by the Cambridge and by the Oxford university presses. His printing press, constructed of iron and employing a novel lever and screw motion, was a labour-saving device which amounted to a considerable improvement on its predecessors and, indeed, the most successful device of its type before the arrival of the steam press. The Oxford University Press purchased several models and it was used for the printing of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. At no time did Stanhope expect to derive a profit from these inventions, and over a long period they proved costly to him. That cost, however, may serve as evidence of his genuine commitment to scientific and technical advance, and of his restless and widely dispersed energy. Among his other schemes was a plan for a canal in Devon to serve his estate in that county and (1801) a new method for burning lime.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>In the later part of his life Stanhope's family relationships were unhappy. Lord Holland's observation that he was &#145;a bad husband, an unkind, perhaps an unjust, father&#146;  (Newman, 186), though exaggerated, was not wholly inaccurate. His erratic conduct and obsessional interests undoubtedly made him difficult to live with. In 1800 his daughter Hester left Chevening to stay with Lady Chatham at Burton Pynsent; shortly afterwards she found refuge with her uncle, William Pitt, and served as his hostess at Downing Street and at Walmer Castle, Pitt's seat as lord warden of the Cinque Ports. She encouraged Stanhope's sons, her half-brothers, to follow her example in departing from the family home. There were unseemly financial wrangles, some of which found their way into court and into print, between Stanhope and his eldest son, Philip Henry, Lord Mahon. The marriage of his daughter Lucy, at sixteen, to the surgeon Thomas Taylor did not receive her father's approval and caused some public amusement. Stanhope disinherited all his children. In his will, dated 22 November 1805, the only member of his family who was even mentioned was his mother, who, in the event, predeceased him. His relations with his second wife deteriorated after the arrival at Chevening of Mrs Walburgh Lackner (<i>d</i>. 1838) as music teacher; she became his mistress and gave up her musical profession on being promised a bequest of &pound;5000 on his death. Stanhope and his wife drew up a deed of separation in 1806. When he died of dropsy at Chevening on 15 December 1816 it was with a distinct sense of personal even more than political isolation. He was buried at Chevening on Christmas eve.<br>
<br>Stanhope was a man of considerable intellectual ability. Many of his ideas, particularly in the scientific and industrial spheres, were successfully taken up by others. In politics he belonged to a group of aristocratic radicals who, for all their energy and sincerity, brought their cause into disrepute and found it difficult to reconcile their principles with their privileges. In the 1780s Wraxall wrote of him<blockquote>His person was tall and thin, his countenance expressive of ardour and impetuosity, as were all his movements. Over his whole figure, and even his dress, an air of puritanism reminded the beholder of the sectaries under Cromwell, rather than a young man of quality in an age of refinement and elegance. (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 3.401&#150;2)</blockquote>Yet he also possessed charm, and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> wrote on his death &#145;Though we did not coincide with the political principles of this distinguished Nobleman, we admired his talents, and hesitate not to admit the eulogy of a partial friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 86/2, 1816, 563). His achievements fell far short of his efforts, but he had the consolation of knowing that he had made a considerable impression among his contemporaries.<br>
