<span class="headword">Boase,  Henry</span>  (1763&#150;1827), <span class="occ">banker and writer on finance</span>, was born at Madron, Cornwall, on 3 June 1763, the fourth son of Arthur Boase (<i>d</i>. 1780) and Jane, daughter of Henry Lugg. He was educated privately in classical languages and French, and in 1779 became a clerk in the office of a relative, Stephen Luke, of Penzance. In 1785 Boase went from Penzance to Roscoff, in Brittany, in a fishing boat, and resided for a time at Morlaix, where he perfected his knowledge of French.<br>
<br>In 1788, not finding any business opening in Cornwall, he obtained a situation in London, as corresponding clerk in the West End banking house of Ransom, Morland, and Hammersley. This house had an extensive continental connection, and after the flight of Louis XVI in 1791 a large part of the funds for the support of the emigrant clergy and nobility passed through its hands. Boase prospered in this position, being promoted to chief clerk in 1792. Seven years later he became the managing partner. On 26 October 1794, Boase married Anne, only child of Matthew and Anne Craige, of Walsall, at St Andrew's Church, Holborn, London. They had a large family, consisting of eight daughters and five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2738/', "Henry Samuel Boase")</script>, geologist and chemist.<br>
<br>During his residence in London, Boase moved in philanthropic and reforming circles and was acquainted with Granville Sharp and Robert Owen. He was a leading member of the London Missionary Society [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "Founders of the London Missionary Society")</script>], and played a considerable part in the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society, in conjunction with the Revd Thomas Charles, of Bala. He was also much interested in the formation of schools on the new monitorial system of Joseph Lancaster.<br>
<br>Boase wrote a number of works on financial questions, including, in 1802, a discussion of the <span class="roman">Bank Restriction Bill</span>, as well as various proposals for the reform of the currency. In 1804 he went to Scotland to examine the affairs of the Dundee New Bank. This led to its reconstruction under new proprietors, including two of Boase's own sons.<br>
<br>Boase's health was seriously affected by the severe winters in London, and in 1809 he retired from his business interests in the City, and went to live at Penzance. There he became a partner in the banking house of Batten, Oxham, and Carne, from 1810 until 1823, when, with the copper manufacturers George Grenfell and Pascoe Grenfell as partners, Boase took over the Penzance Union Bank. A prominent figure in the town, Boase served as a magistrate before becoming mayor of Penzance in 1816.<br>
<br>Scientific and literary pursuits flourished in Cornwall early in the nineteenth century, and Boase found time for both. He played an active role in 1814, along with Dr John Paris and Ashhurst Majendie, in the foundation of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall: he contributed to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, and his eldest son, Dr Henry S. Boase, served as its secretary. He also helped promote the Penzance Public Library. In 1821 Boase was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Boase died at Alverton, Penzance, on 8 April 1827. He was survived by his wife and twelve of his children, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Penzance. His wife died in 1863 at the age of eighty-eight. Boase's sons were also important Cornish figures, and extended their father's banking and intellectual pursuits.<br>
