<span class="headword">Bagster,  Samuel, the younger</span>  (1800&#150;1835), <span class="occ">printer and author</span>, was born in the Strand, London, on 19 October 1800, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1048/', "Samuel Bagster (1772&#150;1851)")</script> and his wife, Eunice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Birch (1777&#150;1877). His two elder brothers died in infancy. He was educated at a school in Oxford, led by the Revd James Hinton, and was articled to his father's publishing business in 1815. He showed a keen interest in religion from an early age and in October 1822 became a member of Blackfriars Baptist Church. After acquiring technical training in his father's publishing house Bagster started his own printing business in Bartholomew Close in 1824. After a brief courtship he married Elizabeth Hunt (<i>d</i>. 1879) on 22 June 1825.<br>
<br>Bagster divided his time between printing, writing, social causes, and hobbies. He was a keen bee-keeper and poultry breeder. In 1831 he wrote and printed <span class="italic">The Management of Bees</span>, with forty wood-engravings. Published jointly by his father and William Pickering, the work was popular and highly thought of. Two further editions were published in 1838 and 1865. Bagster had been given the idea from a work by Samuel Purchas, son of the author of <span class="italic">Purchas, his Pilgrimes</span> (1624&#150;5), entitled <span class="italic">A Theatre of Politicall Flying-Insects</span> (1657). Published in two parts, it described the history and management of bees and provided &#145;meditations and observations, theological and moral&#146; upon the subject, which were reprinted by Bagster at the same time as his own work on bees.<br>
<br>Bagster contributed to his father's polyglot series <span class="italic">The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</span> [<i>c</i>.1833/4]. This consisted of &#145;a rich and copious assemblage of more than 500,000 scripture references and parallel passages from Canne, Brown, Blayney, Scott, and others&#146;. He also projected and planned to produce a series of questions on the gospels for Sunday school children, but the manuscript remained unfinished. Initially concerns about business worried Bagster, but within a few years he had established himself with many of the polyglot bibles and various other publications that came from his press.<br>
<br>Continued poor health induced Bagster to move to Aldine Cottage in the then rural Shepherd's Bush, where he continued his bee-keeping and poultry breeding. The Bagsters were active in the work of the local Baptist chapel. Bagster campaigned against the slave trade and for temperance, and wrote a number of pamphlets on the latter cause.<br>
<br>Bagster's health deteriorated during 1835; by early June he was extremely weak and was nursed by his wife at Aldine Cottage. Bagster sought to comfort his aged father with the words: &#145;I shall be in heaven before you&#146;. On 1 July 1835, at the age of thirty-four, he died at his home; he left no children. He was buried at Tottenham Court Chapel, London.<br>
<br>In 1837 the Revd John Broad published a <span class="italic">Memoir of the Life and Christian Experience of Samuel Bagster, Junr.</span>
<br>
<br>Bagster's remains were reinterred in 1843 in the family vault at Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, Middlesex.<br>
