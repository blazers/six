<span class="headword">Dinham <span class="st"> [ de Dinham]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1200&#150;<em>c.</em>1500), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, was in origin a branch of the Breton family of Dinan, named from the seigneurie of Dinan. The Breton Dinans formed part of a group of baronial families whose seats were located in north-east Brittany, bordering on western Normandy, and whose allegiances were consequently courted by the rulers of Normandy and post-conquest England. The Norman chronicler Wace, probably writing early in Henry II's reign, lists the Dinans among those who participated in the Norman conquest of England; but the first evidence for the family's presence in England is provided by a charter of 1122 of the Breton lord Geoffroi de Dinan, recording his grant of two manors in Devon (Harpford and Nutwell, previously granted to Geoffroi by Henry I) to the Norman monastery of Marmoutier, for the support of its Breton priory of St Malo at Dinan. Although there would later be claims for a greater antiquity for the Dinans in Britain, it is clear that they arrived among the &#145;new men&#146; promoted by Henry I.<br>
<br>Geoffroi de Dinan had three sons, Olivier, Alain, and Josselin, all of whom had significant interests in both England and Brittany. The pipe roll of 1130 shows that the English lands of Olivier, the eldest, were located exclusively in Devon, and it was in south-west England that his descendants were to be increasingly ensconced. Their main seat was to be the large manor of Hartland, on Devon's north coast, and it was there that an earlier college of secular canons was to be refounded as an Augustinian abbey some time before 1169. The refoundation was largely the responsibility of Geoffroi's grandson, another Olivier de Dinan, and his son Geoffrey, but they also had the co-operation of another Geoffroi de Dinan, whose interests lay principally in Brittany. However, by the late twelfth century the Breton and English lines of the family had decisively diverged, and in the following century the Dinhams of Hartland, as they came to be called, start to become prominent in English national life.<br>
<br>The process is to be associated above all with <a name="cosubject_69961"></a><span class="headword">Oliver  de Dinham</span>, Lord Dinham  (<em>c.</em>1234&#150;1299)<span class="occ"></span>, the great-great-grandson of Olivier, the founder of Hartland. Like several of his descendants he was active as a soldier. In March 1264 he was summoned to Oxford for operations against Simon de Montfort, and continued to support the king during the civil war, notably as constable of Exeter Castle later in 1264. A knight by 1271, he had the custody of Lundy island between 1272 and 1275. Under Edward I he campaigned in Wales in 1277 and 1282, and only ill health prevented his serving there again in 1295. He was frequently appointed to commissions in Devon. It was probably a determination to safeguard his interests which led Dinham into a dispute with Hartland Abbey. In 1272, following the death of the abbot, Dinham occupied the abbey, and was only persuaded to withdraw by the bishop of Exeter. He was also active in augmenting his estates. He repurchased the two manors once given to Marmoutier, and between 1268 and 1272 bought several Cornish manors from Isolda of Cardinham, including Cardinham itself. But he made his greatest contribution to his family's standing through his marriage, apparently his second, to Isabel, widow of Sir John Courtenay of Okehampton, and daughter of Hugh de Vere, earl of Oxford. Their union, which had taken place by 1277, cost Dinham &pound;100. Royal service and aristocratic connections no doubt account for the personal summonses to parliament which Dinham received in 1295 and 1296, in consequence of which he is regarded as having become Lord Dinham. When Oliver de Dinham died, on 26 February 1299, he held four manors in Devon, three in Cornwall, and one in Somerset.<br>
<br>Oliver was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_69962"></a><span class="headword">Joce  de Dinham</span>  (1273<span class="mult">x</span>5&#150;1301)<span class="occ"></span>, who was probably the child of his father's first marriage, born between 1273 and 1275 according to different accounts of his age at his father's death. He was summoned to serve in Scotland in 1300, but his death on 30 March 1301 ruled out any possibility of a summons to parliament. He followed his father, however, in making an advantageous marriage, to Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Richard de Hydon of Clayhidon and Hemyock, though the benefits to his descendants were slow to become apparent. Joce had two sons with Margaret, John and Oliver, and it was the latter who succeeded to Clayhidon and Hemyock, which only reverted to John's descendants at the end of the fourteenth century. A minor until 1316, <a name="cosubject_69963"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Dinham</span>  (1295&#150;1331/2)<span class="occ"></span>, was also a soldier, receiving several summonses to campaigns in Scotland, and also to service in Aquitaine in 1325. He was a commissioner of the peace in Devon in 1327 and 1331. But public service was overshadowed by the scandal of his private life. Although married to Margaret, possibly the daughter of Sir William Grandson, John was by 1329 involved in a liaison with Matilda Moleton, said to be his kinswoman. For this he was excommunicated by Bishop Grandison. Dinham appealed, and proceedings were only brought to an end in October 1331, when he was absolved by the archbishop of Canterbury, and went on pilgrimage by way of penance. He did not return, having died some time before 15 April 1332.<br>
<br>His affair with Matilda Moleton notwithstanding, John [i] Dinham left a legitimate heir, <a name="cosubject_69964"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [ii] Dinham</span>  (1317/18&#150;1383)<span class="occ"></span>, who was a minor at his father's death. Although he had been knighted by 1346, he does not appear to have served in Edward III's French campaigns, and he played relatively little part in local government, in 1359 obtaining exemption from jury service and office-holding. Instead he appears to have concentrated on the consolidation and extension of his estates, long reduced by the dowers of his grandmother and mother, who lived until 1357 and 1361 respectively. He made a particularly advantageous marriage, to Muriel, daughter of Sir Thomas Courtenay of Woodhuish, which renewed his own family's links with that of the earls of Devon, and brought him a number of manors, above all that of Kingskerswell; she died in 1374. In 1379 Dinham was said to hold twenty-six knights' fees in Devon and Cornwall.<br>
<br>John [ii] Dinham died on 7 January 1383, killed by two &#145;notorious&#146; thieves, probably in Somerset. His death was speedily avenged by his son, <a name="cosubject_69965"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [iii] Dinham</span>  (1358/9&#150;1428)<span class="occ"></span>, who, then aged twenty-four, slew one of his father's killers and captured the other in Exeter Cathedral, shedding blood in the process. This violent act was one of many in which John [iii] was to be involved. Following a dispute with the abbot of Hartland, in 1397 he was bound in the sum of 1000 marks to keep the peace, only to commit assaults in 1402 and 1404 which cost him 700 marks for a royal pardon. He quarrelled again with the abbey at the end of his life, over his rights as patron in times of vacancy, but the dispute was resolved in 1428. Unlike his immediate forebears, John [iii] had links with the court, perhaps through the Courtenays. Already a knight at his father's death, in 1382 he attended Richard II's wedding, giving a party for his friends before he left for Westminster. Under Henry IV he was appointed to the escort accompanying the king's daughter Blanche to Germany for her marriage, though in the end he did not go, and he came to be styled &#145;king's knight&#146;. A taste for luxury, deducible from his use of hunting arrows bound with gold, may bespeak the courtier. But Dinham was also a useful royal servant in his homeland, being several times appointed to commissions in Devon. In 1401 he obtained exemption from jury service and office-holding, but was still a commissioner of the peace in 1402 and a commissioner of array in 1418 and 1421.<br>
<br>Sir John [iii] married three times: his first wife was Eleanor (surname unknown), who died between 1387 and 1396; his second was Maud Mautravers, widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7432/', "Sir Peter de la Mare")</script>, who brought half the Dorset manor of Hooke to the Dinhams, and who died in 1402; and the third was Philippa, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53092/', "Sir John Lovell")</script>. Philippa was the mother of John Dinham's son and heir, but her husband had earlier shown himself concerned for the descent of his estates. In 1398 he had the manors of Kingskerswell and Nutwell conveyed jointly to his wife Maud and himself, and in 1401 he conveyed what seem to have been all his lands to feoffees, who still held them at his death. His evident concern for his family's possessions makes John [iii] the likeliest compiler of the Dinham cartulary (BL, Add. MS 34792A).<br>
<br>In 1400 John [iii] was reported to be suffering from &#145;a bloody flux&#146;, but he clearly rallied, dying only on Christmas day 1428. His son and heir, <a name="cosubject_69966"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [iv] Dinham</span>  (1405/6&#150;1458)<span class="occ"></span>, was then twenty-two. The fact that his mother lived until 1465, in occupation of her dower lands, may have been one reason why John [iv] took a more active part in public life than his father had done. A knight by 1 May 1430, he attended the young Henry VI to France in that year, and in 1436 was retained to serve at the relief of Calais with eleven men-at-arms and seventy-two archers. Regularly a JP in Devon from 1440, he frequently acted in the same capacity in Cornwall, and received numerous other commissions in both counties. Many of these were for military or peace-keeping purposes, but he was also appointed to assess a subsidy in 1436, to raise a loan to the crown in 1446, and to raise money for the defence of Calais in 1455. During the 1450s he seems to have remained loyal to Henry VI, a fact which makes his son's eventual Yorkism the more surprising. John [iv] married Joan, daughter of Sir Richard Arches, a match which brought him lands in Oxfordshire. He died on 25 January 1458, and was long outlived by his widow, who died early in 1497. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50234/', "John Dynham (c.1433&#150;1501)")</script>, would enter the peerage as Lord Dynham, though his title, like that of Oliver two centuries earlier, endured only for a single generation.<br>
