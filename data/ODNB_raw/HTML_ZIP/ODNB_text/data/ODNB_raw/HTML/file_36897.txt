<span class="headword">Wilding,  Anthony Frederick</span>  (1883&#150;1915), <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, was born on 31 October 1883 at Opawa, near Christchurch, New Zealand, the second of the five children of Frederick Wilding QC (1852&#150;1945) and his wife, Julia Anthony (1854&#150;1936), who had emigrated from England in 1879. Frederick Wilding, an accomplished sportsman, gave his eldest son lessons in rugby, cricket, and lawn tennis, games in which the young schoolboy soon excelled. Anthony Wilding attended Wilson's School at Christchurch, where he captained the football team and began winning tennis tournaments in his teenage years. In 1902 he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied law. He was an able scholar, but made a name for himself on the tennis court. During his first summer term he won the freshmen's lawn tennis tournament; in 1904 he was secretary of the university lawn tennis club; in 1905 he was the club president; and he represented Cambridge University against Oxford in both of these years, when he was their best singles player.<br>
<br>On graduating from Cambridge in 1905, Wilding read for the bar and was called by the Inner Temple in 1906, before qualifying as barrister and solicitor of the supreme court of New Zealand in 1909. Yet he retained a strong interest in lawn tennis, at which he had made steady progress. From 1903 onwards he won championships in virtually all parts of the tennis world. He was very fond of travelling to compete in tournaments, and sometimes journeyed half-way across Europe on his motorcycle to do so. From 1905 he represented Australasia in the Davis cup, a prize which, alongside Norman Brookes, he captured from Great Britain in 1907 and retained in 1908, 1909, and 1911. Wilding's record at Wimbledon was particularly impressive. In 1910 he won the All England singles championship by defeating the title-holder, A. Wentworth Gore; then he retained the title for the next three years (1911&#150;13), defeating in turn H. Roper Barrett, A. W. Gore, and M. E. McLoughlin in the final. Wilding also won the Wimbledon championship doubles in 1907 (partnered by Brookes), in 1908 and 1910 (partnered by M. J. G. Ritchie), and in 1914 (partnered again by Brookes).<br>
<br>It was by constant practice and rigorous physical training that Wilding made himself into one of the great players of his era. In his early days he would hit a tennis ball for hours against a wall. He was not regarded as one of the most brilliant or graceful of lawn tennis players, but was reckoned one of the most difficult to beat. His main strengths were concentration, determination, and physical fitness; his main weaknesses were a suspect backhand and somewhat erratic overhead play. His autobiography, <span class="italic">On the Court and Off</span> (1912), was published at the height of his tennis fame. By then he was having to concentrate on his business career in Britain and New Zealand.<br>
<br>In July 1914, at New York, Wilding and Brookes regained the Davis cup for Australasia from the United States. Shortly afterwards the outbreak of the First World War brought a halt to Wilding's tennis heroics. He joined the Royal Marines, and in October 1914 was gazetted second lieutenant at headquarters intelligence corps. His knowledge of European roads was potentially valuable, and he was keen to work with armoured vehicles. He volunteered for an auxiliary armoured squadron in the Royal Naval Air Service, and in March 1915 was posted to France with the rank of lieutenant. In early May 1915 Wilding was promoted captain, and his team was moved to the front line near Neuve Chapelle, France. Just one week later, on 9 May 1915, he was killed when a shell exploded adjacent to the dug-out in which he was sheltering. He was unmarried. He was buried the following day and reinterred after the war at a Rue-des-Berceux military ceremony.<br>
