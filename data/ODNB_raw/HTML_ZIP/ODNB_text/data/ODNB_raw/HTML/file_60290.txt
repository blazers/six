<span class="headword">Mitchell,  Charles</span>  (1807&#150;1859), <span class="occ">advertising agent and publisher of the first British press directory</span>, was born in Norwich and baptized on 22 March 1807 at St Giles's Church, Norwich. He was the son of Robert Mitchell, a fruiterer, and his wife, Letitia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moore. Of his first marriage nothing is known, but on 27 May 1839 he married, as a widower, Eliza Wellsman (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Rogers), an innkeeper's widowed daughter, at the parish church of St Benedict, Norwich.<br>
<br>Fresh from an apprenticeship under Thomas Sowler, founder in 1825 of the <span class="italic">Manchester Courier</span>, a conservative paper in opposition to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, he founded in 1837 C. Mitchell &amp; Co., one of the earliest advertising agencies, there being at the time probably no more than two or three others in the British Isles and none in Europe and America. In the quaint little offices at 12&#150;13 Red Lion Court, Fleet Street (demolished by 1912), he became acquainted with or had business dealings with the great journalists of the day, including Charles Dickens, Mark Lemon, Shirley Brooks of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, and Stirling Coyne, drama critic of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and a co-signatory of the foundation document of <span class="italic">Punch</span>. The exact circumstances of <span class="italic">Punch's</span> establishment remain unclear, but according to the <span class="italic">City Press</span> of 27 June 1892 Mitchell frequently asserted that the comic journal originated with him, Brooks, Henry Mayhew, and Ebenezer Landells. In his magisterial <span class="italic">History of &#145;Punch&#146;</span> (p. 32) M. H. Spielmann merely notes that the printing was executed by Mitchell.<br>
<br>As a publisher Mitchell issued the dramatic works of John Westland Marston (1819&#150;1890), notably his heroic blank verse poem &#145;The Patrician's Daughter&#146; (1842&#150;3), and in 1853 he acted as agent and publisher for a prospectus for the Athenaeum Institute in Sackville Street.<br>
<br>Mitchell's place in newspaper history stems directly from his chosen role of advertising agent for town and country newspapers. Awareness of a gap in the market prompted his decision in March 1846 to issue the first edition of the <span class="italic">Newspaper Press Directory</span>. Preceded by the intermittent <span class="italic">Advertisers' Guide to the Newspaper Press of the United Kingdom</span> (1844) and <span class="italic">S. Deacon's Correct List of All the English, Scotch and Irish Newspapers</span> (1846), the latter &#145;distinguishing those of Conservative Principles&#146;, Mitchell's directory promised to offer a regular and &#145;more dignified and permanent record&#146; replacing the more fugitive handbooks which he claimed inadequately promoted the &#145;interests of the proprietors&#146; and failed to guide advertisers in the choice of media best suited to their needs. Numerically slim as was the newspaper press at the time, the enterprise demanded great ability, tact, and judgement. Published initially in 1846, 1847, 1851, and 1854, and annually after 1856, this, among the eldest of all trade directories, offered generally impartial coverage of the national press. The earlier octavo volumes are primarily geographical indexes covering London, the provinces, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, with alphabetical cross-indexes. While reserving judgement on aims and characteristics, the directory's pen portraits of individual newspapers were generally friendly though naturally governed by self-interested commercialism and the wish for future generous treatment and advertisement allocation. There was surprisingly little early information on rates or circulation figures. Religious &#145;advocacy&#146; was given as much prominence as political affiliation. Entries varied in length and it is salutary to observe the warm welcome given to the closely coincidental arrival of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, in January 1846. Edited for twenty days by Dickens, with the assistance of John Forster and George Hogarth, the new paper was described in the directory as &#145;an organ which includes so eminently the men who at once guide and represent the public mind&#146;, lauding those leading minds who had not &#145;received their principles from tradition, but evolved them from a vivid and primary experience of life&#146;. The post-Dickens entry was significantly perfunctory. Due deference was paid in the first issue to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, whose influence Mitchell felt to be &#145;co-extensive with civilization&#146;. Uniquely featured in the 1846 issue was the topical theme of &#145;railway papers&#146; (eighteen titles). A year later the railway mania bubble had evidently burst, the list having completely disappeared.<br>
<br>Editorship passed in 1859 to Mitchell's adopted stepson Walter Wellsman (1834&#150;1911), then in his mid-twenties but well versed since schooldays in proof-reading and editorial duties and destined to become a most durable editor and a significant press historian. A notable collector also of Dickens memorabilia, Wellsman expanded the directory's scope by adding in 1860 an index of magazines and periodicals and a national newspaper map. Subsequent additions included an index of continental newspapers (1878), an index of American papers (1879), and a colonial supplement in 1885/6. Mitchell was strongly opposed to the abolition of stamp duty in 1855, which he feared would reduce press respectability to the level of American papers. But with the first change of format to &#145;extra imperial&#146; in 1854 (at the reduced price of a florin), due coverage was accorded to the highly contentious issue of press emancipation. Mitchell's death on 8 February 1859 at his home at 1 Edith Villas, Edith Grove, Chelsea, London, was reportedly as the result of a serious railway accident the previous year. The indispensable reference work he founded continues to this day in three volumes as <span class="italic">Benn's Media</span>.<br>
