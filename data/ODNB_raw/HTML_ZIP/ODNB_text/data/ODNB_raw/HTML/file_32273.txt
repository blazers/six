<span class="headword">Campbell, Sir  Ronald Hugh</span>  (1883&#150;1953), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in London on 27 September 1883, the eldest son of Sir Francis Alexander Campbell (1852&#150;1911), assistant under-secretary of state for foreign affairs from 1902 to 1911, and his wife, Dora Edith, daughter of Hugh Hammersley, army agent and banker. He was educated at Haileybury College and in June 1907 passed a competitive examination and was appointed a clerk in the Foreign Office. On 30 April 1908 he married Helen (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of Richard Graham. They had a son and a daughter. In October 1910 Campbell was appointed an acting third secretary in the diplomatic service, and in November of that year he accompanied Sir Arthur Paget on a special embassy to the courts of Munich, Stuttgart, and Sofia to announce the accession of George V. In the following year he was in attendance on the representative of Venezuela at the coronation. From October 1913 to July 1919 he was private secretary to the permanent under-secretary and in January 1919 he was promoted second secretary while in attendance at the Paris peace conference. From July 1919 to December 1920 he was private secretary to Lord Curzon, acting secretary of state. He was appointed CMG in 1917 and promoted first secretary in September 1919.<br>
<br>Having in April 1928 been promoted counsellor at the Foreign Office, Campbell was in November 1929 appointed envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary in Paris, where he often acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires. With his perfect command of French, he made many friends in official circles and proved himself a shrewd observer and an able negotiator. He was appointed minister to Belgrade in August 1935 and KCMG in January 1936. His lucid and well-balanced dispatches revealed an exceptional insight into the shifting pattern of Yugoslavia's foreign policy, subjected as it then was to mounting Nazi&#150;fascist pressures.<br>
<br>In July 1939 Campbell was promoted to succeed Sir Eric Phipps as ambassador at Paris. He was sworn of the privy council, and took up his new appointment early in November. Calm, unruffled, as impeccable in unravelling knotty problems as in his personal appearance, he was endowed with the sturdiest common sense, an infinite capacity for taking pains, and a dry sense of humour; it was said that he wrote with such meticulous care that he never needed to correct a draft telegram. When the Germans invaded France in May 1940 this unassuming and gently persuasive Scot soon found his qualities as a diplomatist put to the severest test. Major-General Sir Edward Spears, who liaised on Churchill's behalf with French premier Paul Reynaud, perceived &#145;a real toughness under the smoothness of his exterior, an unflinching purpose at the back of his non-committal manner&#146;  (Spears, 178). Campbell took part on 11 June 1940 in the exodus of the French government from Paris: first to Tours, and three days later to Bordeaux. In intensely trying conditions he attempted to prevail on the French leaders to transfer overseas at least the nucleus of a government and to place their fleet beyond the range of axis interference. After the signature of the Franco-German armistice had made it useless for him to remain at Bordeaux, he embarked for England on 22 June. On his return home he rejoined the Foreign Office and was promoted GCMG.<br>
<br>In November 1940 Campbell was appointed ambassador to Lisbon with a specific brief to maintain Portugal's benevolent neutrality and help prevent Spain from entering the war on the side of the axis powers. In mid-December 1941 Anglo-Portuguese relations came near to breaking-point as a result of the unannounced entry of Australian and Dutch troops into Portuguese Timor to protect the colony from invasion by the Japanese. Campbell's dogged resourcefulness prevented the crisis from becoming an open quarrel. His masterly telegrams stressed the vital importance of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance for British Atlantic strategy and the need to avoid further alienating the Portuguese government and its leader, the dictator Dr Antonio Salazar. They were also reinforced by a visit to London. As a result an agreement was brought about that the troops would be withdrawn as soon as Portuguese forces arrived to replace them. The Japanese seized the island before this arrangement could be completed&#151;which was fortunate, as Churchill intended that the Dutch and Australians should stay. In the summer of 1943 Campbell received the emissaries of Marshal Badoglio, who had been appointed Italian premier following the fall of Mussolini, when they arrived in Lisbon to sue for an armistice. In the same year he presided over the delicate negotiations which led to the grant of Portuguese facilities in the Azores to the allied forces. The Azores played an increasingly significant role in the build-up of American forces before and after the D-day landings in 1944. The negotiations over the Azores had been preceded by a great deal of preparation by Campbell and his staff, not least being his contribution to a series of secret conversations between Portuguese and British military staffs from the winter of 1941. Campbell's unremitting efforts also secured for Britain the lion's share of Portugal's vital supplies of wolfram ore (tungsten).<blockquote>Campbell &hellip; was just our man, courteous to everybody, rich in experience, dispassionate in his judgement &hellip; assuring us, with a touch of the best Foreign Office cynicism, that nothing was ever as serious as we thought it was. One day &hellip; when things had gone very wrong and we expected an explosion, he broke off the meeting and rang for the chef to tell him there was just time to make a better apple charlotte for lunch, &#145;You know, the brown stuff on top must crunch and taste burnt&#146;. We all loved him. (Eccles, 99)</blockquote>In July 1945 his superbly handled mission in Portugal came to an end and he retired.<br>
<br>It was appropriate that a man of Campbell's exemplary patience should have been an expert angler and that, with his keen eye for precise detail, he also excelled as a skilled cabinet-maker. The last years of his life were clouded by the death in 1949 of his charming and vivacious wife, Helen, and by the death of his daughter. He died at Lymington Hospital, Lymington, Hampshire, on 16 November 1953, of an intestinal obstruction. His son, Robin, who survived him, had been severely wounded in the attempt to kidnap Rommel during the North African campaign.<br>
<br>In 2002, many years after Campbell's death, it emerged that he had saved the lives of some 1000 Jews from Nazi-occupied central Europe, while ambassador in Lisbon, by arranging visas for them to flee to Mauritius, and by persuading the Portuguese authorities to issue transit or entrance visas. His actions led <span class="italic">The Times</span> to describe him as &#145;a British Oskar Schindler&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 April 2002), after the Sudeten German who had saved a similar number of Jews in German-occupied Poland.<br>
