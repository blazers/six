<span class="headword">Davenport,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> 1670), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was born in Coventry, Warwickshire, and baptized at Holy Trinity Church there on 9 April, the son of Henry Davenport (<i>d</i>. by 1627), a merchant and alderman of that city, and Winifred Barneby. Probably educated initially at the free school, Coventry, in 1613, shortly after having experienced a religious conversion, he matriculated at Merton College, Oxford. Two years later he transferred to Magdalen College, Oxford, which was known at that time for its puritan sympathies. Shortly thereafter, and before graduating, he left the university in order to accept a chaplaincy at Hylton Castle, co. Durham. He had married Elizabeth Wooley (<i>d</i>. 1676), about whom little is known, in or before 1619 when he became curate at St Lawrence Jewry in the City of London. He earned a reputation there as an inspiring preacher and in 1624 was elected vicar of St Stephen, Coleman Street. Because of doubts about his orthodoxy the influence of prominent puritans was needed to persuade the bishop of London to accept his election, but at this stage of his career Davenport conformed to the liturgical practices of the church, convinced that differences over such matters must be subordinated to the need for a united Calvinist front against Catholicism and Arminianism. On 28 June 1625 he was awarded both the BD and MA degrees of Oxford. In that same year he garnered favourable notice for ministering to his flock during a severe outbreak of plague.<br>
<br>The spread of anticalvinism in the church, coupled with the rise of a new ceremonialism, drove Davenport and other puritans towards nonconformity, while the failure of James I and Charles I to support the protestant cause on the continent led them to become critics as well of the government's foreign policy. In 1626 Davenport helped formally to organize the feoffees for impropriations, a corporation that sought to spread puritan influence by purchasing church livings and awarding them to zealous preachers. The same year he joined with Richard Sibbes, Thomas Taylor, and William Gouge in circulating a letter calling for contributions to aid protestant refugees from the Thirty Years' War. In a sermon preached before the London Artillery Company, &#145;A royal edict for military exercises&#146; (1629), he called for English support for the international protestant cause.<br>
<br>In 1633 the trustees of the feoffees for impropriations were called before high commission and the enterprise was quashed, but none the less that year Davenport joined with Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye, William Twisse, and other conforming puritans in a meeting at Ockley, Surrey, at the home of Henry Whitfield, where they endeavoured to persuade John Cotton and Thomas Hooker of the need to make what compromises were necessary to maintain their livings in the church. The outcome, however, was that Cotton persuaded a number of his friends, including Davenport, that the demands of the church had become too great and that nonconformity was required of puritan consciences. In consequence, Davenport left England for the Netherlands in December 1633. There he was called by the congregation of the English church in Amsterdam to serve as an assistant to John Paget but the latter, who had previously clashed with Hooker over issues of church government, blocked Davenport's appointment. The dispute in the Amsterdam church anticipated the tensions that would later divide puritans into congregationalists and presbyterians. Davenport's <span class="italic">Church Government and Church-Covenant Discussed</span> (1643) and <span class="italic">The Power of the Congregational Churches Asserted and Vindicated</span> (1672) were based on manuscripts that he circulated in the 1630s setting forth his position in opposition to Paget. Blocked from a formal call, he ministered to unofficial congregations in Amsterdam and Rotterdam for a time; his only child, John, was born and baptized on 15 April 1635 at The Hague.<br>
<br>In 1636 Davenport returned secretly to England to prepare to migrate to America. Together with other members of his former congregation of St Stephen, Coleman Street, Davenport arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, in June 1637. He participated in the Cambridge synod and the examination of Anne Hutchinson, and advised on the formation of Harvard College. In 1638 he and his followers founded the town and colony of Quinnipiac, later renamed New Haven. The new colony closely reflected Davenport's belief in congregations rigorously restricted to the elect and in civil affairs strongly controlled by the godly.<br>
<br>Davenport closely followed the course of political and religious change in England. He was invited to sit in the Westminster assembly of divines, convened in 1643 to propose a reform of the national church, but chose to stay in America and offer advice from afar. He was the spokesman for the New England clergy in <span class="italic">An Answer of the Elders of Severall Churches in New England</span> (1643) which responded to queries from England about colonial polity. He wrote other tracts on church reform in the 1640s and 1650s, defending congregationalism from both presbyterian and sectarian attacks. When the Cromwellian regime collapsed he was instrumental in providing refuge for the proscribed regicides Edward Whalley and William Goffe. His <span class="italic">The Saints Anchor-Hold, in All Storms and Tempests</span> (1661) was a series of sermons preached to the New Haven faithful urging them to remain committed to their mission despite the Stuart Restoration.<br>
<br>Davenport continued to cling to the model of reform created by his generation of founders. He unsuccessfully opposed the merger of New Haven with the more liberal Connecticut colony in 1662, and he was the foremost opponent of the liberalization of colonial church membership referred to as the half-way covenant. His career ended in controversy following his acceptance in 1667 of a call to replace the deceased John Wilson as pastor of the First Church of Boston. His claim to have been released for the new post by his New Haven church led to charges of deception, and his strong conservative stand caused a split in his new congregation, triggering a highly charged debate over the autonomy of local congregations, a debate that was further inflamed by his election sermon to the Massachusetts legislature in 1669. He died at Boston on 15 March of the following year of a paralytic stroke, and was buried in what became King's Chapel burial-ground; he was survived by his wife, who died on 15 September 1676. Less renowned as a preacher and theologian than Cotton or Hooker, Davenport's longevity and more mainstream views allowed him to have a longer and more profound role in the shaping of New England religion than his two famous contemporaries.<br>
