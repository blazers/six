<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Reade,  Charles</span>  (1814&#150;1884), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born on 8 June 1814 at Ipsden House, Oxfordshire, the seventh son and tenth and youngest surviving child of John Reade (<i>d</i>. 1849) and his wife, Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1862), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24893/', "Major John Scott (later Scott-Waring) MP")</script>, a former associate of Warren Hastings in India. Reade's mother, a devout evangelical, was a friend of Samuel Wilberforce, G. S. Faber, and other leading low-church clergymen and public figures. Charles was her favourite child and many of his most distinctive qualities as a writer, including his crusading humanitarian zeal, his dogmatism, and blind conviction of his own rightness, and even his brusque prose style, have been plausibly attributed to her influence. His father, a tory squire of the old school, had little in common with his wife and youngest son. Reade professed to believe that the best of his Reade blood came from a great-grandmother who was the daughter of a village blacksmith.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears18141850"></a>Early years, 1814&#150;1850</h2>As a small boy Reade depended for emotional support on his mother and an elder sister, Julia, rather than on his father. Julia, who may have been the model for Julia Dodd in his novel <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span>, married when he was nine, and he was sent to a private school at Rose Hill, Iffley, run by the Revd John Slatter. Reade nicknamed Slatter Scourger, but other old boys of the school denied that he was a ferocious disciplinarian, a possible prototype of the sadistic gaoler Hawes in <span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span>. After four years at Rose Hill, Reade spent two happier years (1827&#150;9) at Staines Lodge, a private school in Staines conducted by a curate named Hearn. He then studied with a crammer, a Mr Durham. His mother wished him to go to Oxford, expecting that he would enter the church after graduation, and in 1831 he won a demyship at Magdalen College with an essay on ambition and virtue. In 1835, according to the memoir by his son and elder brother, a college fellowship reserved for men born in Oxfordshire fell vacant unexpectedly, spurring him to sit for his final examinations after only three weeks' preparation  (Reade and Reade, 1.143). Although a third-class degree&#151;in Greats&#151;was the best he could manage in the circumstances, he was elected probationary fellow on 22 July 1835, Vinerian scholar on 1 December 1835, and fellow of Magdalen in the summer of 1836. His choice as fellow was challenged by a man with a better degree, and his parents and their friends were said to have secured him the Vinerian scholarship by bringing in MAs from miles around to vote for him. He remained a fellow of Magdalen for the rest of his life, serving as junior dean of arts in 1841 and 1843, bursar in 1844 and 1849, vice-president in 1851, and junior bursar in 1859. Once he had taken his MA degree (on 26 April 1838) his fellowship did not require him to reside in Oxford, but in the years of his fame, and particularly in the early 1860s, he did much of his writing in his rooms at Magdalen, using them as a retreat. His tenure of the fellowship was contingent on his remaining unmarried, a stipulation he complained of bitterly but continued to put up with, even when he was earning thousands a year as a writer and would hardly have missed the annual stipend of &pound;250 (which may eventually have risen to &pound;600).<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Reade laid the foundations of his lifelong reputation for eccentricity and nonconformity. He wore his hair unfashionably long, dressed colourfully, devoted all his time to reading, and abstained totally from alcohol and tobacco&#151;as he was to do throughout his life. He was tall and burly, with a tiny head and ungainly gait  (Elwin, 38). There is nothing to indicate that he ever intended to fall in with his mother's wishes and become ordained. His subsequent life and literary career leave no doubt that he would have found it impossible to submit to the discipline and decorum of the church and to subscribe to all of its teachings, especially those relating to sex. Both his fellowship and his Vinerian scholarship were lay awards, intended to enable him to read law (although later, in 1837 or 1838, he may also briefly have tried medicine, in Edinburgh). While he never actually practised law, litigation became one of his fiercest passions, and his legal training must also have played a significant part in developing the ostentatious reliance on &#145;facts&#146;, documentary evidence presented in the style of a courtroom advocate, which became the trade mark of his novels and plays &#145;with a purpose&#146;. After being entered at Lincoln's Inn on 20 November 1835, he first read in chambers with Samuel Warren, the novelist, soon to score a hit with his novel <span class="italic">Ten Thousand a Year</span>, which Reade greatly admired and perhaps tried to imitate in some of his own fiction. Subsequently, from 1838 to 1842, he read with another barrister, Matthew Fortescue. On 17 February 1842, immediately after being called to the bar, he was elected to a Vinerian fellowship worth &pound;80 a year which he thereafter held in conjunction with his college fellowship. He proceeded to the degree of DCL on 1 July 1847.<br>
<br>From the time he began reading with Fortescue, if not earlier, Reade lived in Soho, near Leicester Square, and pursued a mildly Bohemian existence, eating in out-of-the-way taverns and haunting the theatres. He was elected to the Garrick Club, of which he became a stalwart, on 14 December 1839. In the summer of 1839 he made his first trip abroad, to France and Switzerland. After his return he for the next few years &#145;oscillated between London, Ipsden, and Scotland&#146;  (Reade and Reade, 1.237). In London he collected, repaired, and traded in Cremona violins, about which he later published four learned articles in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (19&#150;31 August 1872). At Ipsden he hunted and shot, played cricket, or boated and fished. In Scotland, where his elder brother William married and settled in 1837, he acquired a herring fishery (which proved unprofitable); more momentously, he fell in love with a pretty young woman, the prototype of his fictional heroine Christie Johnstone, and probably contracted a Scottish (common-law) marriage with her. If Reade's mother found out about the relationship, it can be assumed that she strongly opposed it, just as the mother of Christie's lover opposed his. But Reade continued to live with the young woman, when he could, from 1838 or 1839 until 1848, when she died giving birth to their son. The boy was called Charles Liston, presumably taking his mother's surname; he was passed off as Reade's godson until just before Reade's death, when he took the name Charles Liston Reade and was declared Reade's heir and literary executor.<h2>
<a name="Risetofame18511870"></a>Rise to fame, 1851&#150;1870</h2>According to Reade he &#145;began to make notes with a view to writing fiction&#146; in 1835  (Reade and Reade, 2.159). However, his first published novel, <span class="italic">Peg Woffington</span>, did not appear until December 1852, when he was thirty-eight, and he was forty-two by the time he achieved his first great success as a novelist with <span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span> (1856). At the outset he had tried to make his mark as dramatist rather than novelist, producing no fewer than five plays that were staged in London in 1851&#150;2 and several others that remained unacted. Most were translations or &#145;adaptations&#146; from the French, including the first of his plays to be performed, <span class="italic">The Ladies' Battle</span> (Olympic Theatre, 7 May 1851), which was adapted from a play by Scribe and Legouv&eacute; that he had seen during one of his many visits to Paris as a dealer in violins. His first three novels were all initially written as plays and then turned into novels. <span class="italic">Christie Johnstone</span> (1853), which he said he wrote in 1849 or 1850, never saw the light of day in its dramatic form, but <span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span> was based on one successful play, <span class="italic">Gold</span>, which had opened at Drury Lane on 10 January 1853, and was later turned into another, <span class="italic">It's Never too Late to Mend</span> (Princess's Theatre, 4 October 1865). <span class="italic">Peg Woffington</span> was based on the highly popular sentimental comedy <span class="italic">Masks and Faces</span> (Haymarket Theatre, 20 November 1852), which Reade wrote in collaboration with his friend Tom Taylor, already an established dramatist; the collaboration proved difficult and Taylor completed the final draft on his own, Reade having withdrawn to Malvern to undergo a course of hydropathic treatment for his nerves. Dedicated to Taylor and published less than a month after <span class="italic">Masks and Faces</span> opened, <span class="italic">Peg Woffington</span> dealt with the same subject and appropriated much of Taylor's dialogue without his permission. This was one of the first and most notorious manifestations of what Edmund Yates described as Reade's &#145;odd notions of literary <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>&#146;  (Yates, 2.164). Previously, like other English dramatists at the time, Reade had shown no compunction about adapting or translating French plays without permission; in <span class="italic">The Eighth Commandment</span> (1860), the impassioned plea for the sanctity of &#145;literary property&#146; which he claimed cost him &pound;1000 to publish, he made out that he ceased doing so as soon as the <span class="roman">International Copyright Act</span> of 1851 came into force, but the facts suggest otherwise. Besides further adaptations from the French&#151;including some for which he really did obtain the authors' permission&#151;his early plays included a dramatized version of <span class="italic">Peregrine Pickle</span>. This opened in November 1854 at St James's Theatre, which he had leased for the season of 1854&#150;5, installing his friend the actress Laura Seymour as manager.<br>
<br>Reade boasted that all his major novels&#151;<span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span>, <span class="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</span> (1861), <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Griffith Gaunt</span> (1866), and <span class="italic">Put yourself in his Place</span> (1870)&#151;were written on a scientific &#145;Baconian&#146; system of induction from documented &#145;facts&#146;. The subtitle &#145;A matter-of-fact romance&#146; which he used for <span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span>, <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span>, and several of his shorter fictions reflects this aspiration to a documentary adherence to the &#145;truth&#146;, especially in the treatment of social problems. His principal source of facts was newspaper cuttings, which he began collecting in 1848 and continued to accumulate in hundreds of notebooks throughout his writing career. But he also drew unashamedly, often verbatim and at length, on facts set out in other people's books. In <span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span>, for example, the materials for his famously graphic exposure of the sadistic torture of prisoners, including the psychological torments caused by the &#145;silent and solitary&#146; system in vogue at the time, were drawn partly from his own on-the-spot research at Durham, Oxford, and Reading gaols, partly from newspaper articles&#151;including an opportune report of brutalities at Birmingham gaol in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (12 September 1853), but quite largely from a book by Hepworth Dixon, <span class="italic">The London Prisons</span> (1850). Some of the most admired details of the gold-digging scenes in the same novel were taken from William Howitt's <span class="italic">Land, Labour, and Gold, or, Two Years in Victoria</span>, and from other books. (Reade himself suffered from seasickness and never travelled further abroad than continental Europe.) He claimed to have toiled through eight volumes for the portrayal of Isaac Levi in <span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span>, but according to Wayne Burns  (p. 143) Levi is virtually the same in the novel as he had been in the play <span class="italic">Gold</span>, written before this copious research was undertaken. For <span class="italic">A Good Fight</span> (1859), the short novel which grew into <span class="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</span>, Reade said that he read seventy-nine books; while for <span class="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</span> itself he filled three &#145;gigantic cards&#146; with notes about hermits, and for <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span> no fewer than forty notecards containing 107,000 words. In the eyes of many reviewers the authenticity Reade laid claim to, especially when exposing social evils, was largely vitiated by his sensationalism and melodrama, which he defiantly defended, and which made it a simple matter for him to turn his novels into plays and his plays into novels. Several of his novels, particularly <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span>, <span class="italic">Griffith Gaunt</span>, and <span class="italic">A Terrible Temptation</span> (1871), also transgressed Victorian notions of sexual propriety. When <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span> (or <span class="italic">Very Hard Cash</span> as it was initially titled) reached the end of its serial run in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> (26 December 1863), Dickens took the extraordinary step of inserting a signed note after the final instalment effectively dissociating himself, as editor, from its &#145;statements and opinions&#146;, and although professing a high regard for Reade he privately considered some of the sexual episodes in <span class="italic">Griffith Gaunt</span> &#145;extremely coarse and disagreeable&#146;  (Burns, 261). But Reade's gift for rapid, exciting narrative, lively dialogue, and vivid, often horrific description ensured his popularity. For <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span> and <span class="italic">Griffith Gaunt</span>, the two novels that immediately followed his most acclaimed work, <span class="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</span>, Reade probably received total rates of payment unequalled at the time by any other novelist except Dickens, George Eliot, and Wilkie Collins. He became proverbial for his vigilance and bargaining skills in his dealings with his publishers. The sales of his novels in their initial multi-volume form suffered from a virtual boycott by Mudie's Library, which rejected several of them on the grounds of indecency, but he compensated by obtaining large prices for the serial rights and for the cheaper, one-volume editions, particularly those issued in America where he was the first major English novelist to negotiate directly with publishers.<br>
<br>Reade's personal life during the years of his rise to fame and prosperity is not well documented. His passion for the theatre, dating back at least to his days as a law student, evidently had much to do with his attraction to actresses. One such was the acclaimed comic actress Mary-Anne (Fanny) Stirling, under whose management his first play was produced in 1851, who later appeared in it herself, and who spent a week with him at Oxford before being driven away, it was said, by his mother  (Burns, 38&#150;9); as she was already married Reade's fellowship cannot have been seriously at risk. A few years later, in 1853, he fell in love with another married actress, Laura Seymour; they began living together then or soon after and continued to do so until Seymour's death in 1879. Though known as Reade's &#145;housekeeper&#146; she went on practising her profession until the onset of her terminal illness.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears18701884"></a>Later years, 1870&#150;1884</h2>Reade's literary career reached and passed its zenith about 1870. The year before, he and Laura Seymour had moved into a red-brick mansion at 2 Albert Gate, Knightsbridge, beside Hyde Park. In addition to the leasehold of this house he owned three freehold properties in the Brompton Road. All were purchased, presumably, with the huge proceeds of his novels <span class="italic">Hard Cash</span> and <span class="italic">Griffith Gaunt</span> and his play <span class="italic">It's Never too Late to Mend</span>, his first for eight years, which had its London opening at the Princess's Theatre on 4 October 1865, enjoyed a long run there, and was frequently revived afterwards. Reade and Seymour had previously resided first at 193 Piccadilly, and later, from 1856 to 1868, at 6 Bolton Row, Mayfair. In his new house Reade had a spacious writing-room overlooking the park and ample accommodation for a variety of animals, including at one time a &#145;small antelope or gazelle&#146;  (Maxwell, 324). <span class="italic">Put yourself in his Place</span>, the last three-volume novel written on Reade's &#145;great system&#146; of laborious fact-gathering, was published in June 1870. It sold well and was received kindly by the reviewers because of its lurid exposure of outrages allegedly committed by trade unions. Subsequently, however, both the quality of his fiction and the lump-sum payments he received for it began to fall away. <span class="italic">A Terrible Temptation</span> (1871) achieved a modest <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i> after being savagely attacked for its &#145;indelicacy&#146;, and the novelette <span class="italic">The Wandering Heir</span> (1873) successfully cashed in on the excitement generated by the Tichborne claimant. But neither these nor any of the other five novels he produced in the 1870s and 1880s did anything to enhance his critical standing. His greatest hit was scored with a play, <span class="italic">Drink</span> (Princess's Theatre, 2 June 1879), adapted from Zola's <span class="italic">L'assommoir</span>. Some of his earlier plays were also revived with considerable success, for example <span class="italic">Masks and Faces</span>, with Squire and Marie Bancroft, in 1875, and with other actors in 1881 and 1883; <span class="italic">It's Never too Late to Mend</span>, with Ellen Terry in 1874, and with other actors in 1878 and 1881; and <span class="italic">The Courier of Lyons</span> (1854), revised as <span class="italic">The Lyons Mail</span>, with Henry Irving in 1877. But other theatrical ventures cost him dearly. In 1867 both <span class="italic">Dora</span> (Adelphi, 1 June), with Kate Terry, and <span class="italic">The Double Marriage</span> (Queen's, 24 October), with Ellen Terry, had failed miserably and no theatre would stage his dramatic adaptation of <span class="italic">Griffith Gaunt</span>. And in 1870 he was said to have lost &pound;5000 when he staged <span class="italic">Free Labour</span>, adapted from <span class="italic">Put yourself in his Place</span>, at the Adelphi Theatre (28 May) under his own management, and subsequently at the National Standard Theatre and in the provinces. He was more successful with his stage version of <span class="italic">The Wandering Heir</span>, first performed in London at the Queen's Theatre, under Laura Seymour's management, on 15 November 1873; Ellen Terry began appearing in it on 28 February 1874 and remained with Reade's and Seymour's company when the play was subsequently transferred to Astley's Amphitheatre, then toured the provinces in repertory with several of Reade's other plays. Reade seems to have been infatuated with Terry, on stage at least.<br>
<br>Reade continued to indulge his propensity for litigation, almost regardless of the cost. With a few exceptions, including his earliest recourse to the courts, in March 1857, when he had unsuccessfully sued the publisher Richard Bentley for issuing a cheap edition of <span class="italic">Christie Johnstone</span> without his permission, he frequently acted on flimsy, if not vexatious grounds. One of his greatest victories, in a libel case against a New York paper which had branded <span class="italic">Griffith Gaunt</span> indecent&#151;a charge Reade had responded to in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Prurient Prude</span>&#151;returned him only a derisory six cents' damages. He did better later when similar complaints were made against <span class="italic">A Terrible Temptation</span>, suing and winning &pound;200 damages from a &#145;cabal&#146; of reviewers whom he branded &#145;the Licensed Victuallers&#146;, because they consorted in clubs and pubs where they learned &#145;the art of naughty interpretation and distortion of honest words&#146;  (Elwin, 240).<br>
<br>Allegations of plagiarism continued to dog Reade, the best-remembered of them arising from <span class="italic">Shilly-Shally</span>, his unauthorized dramatization of Anthony Trollope's novel <span class="italic">Ralph the Heir</span>, first performed at the Gaiety Theatre on 1 April 1872. Trollope protested angrily and publicly, and for several years afterwards he and Reade did not speak to each other even when playing whist or cribbage together at the Garrick Club. Closer friends like Tom Taylor were more forgiving, not doubting the sincerity of Reade's long campaign for the protection of literary and dramatic copyright in spite of his apparent double standards. At various stages of his career he waged many other campaigns with equal vehemence, and often with an almost laughable one-sidedness. Among the causes he took up were animal welfare and ambidexterity&#151;which he believed all children should be taught. His favourite targets included the incompetence and obfuscations of the medical and legal professions and the institutionalized cruelties practised in prisons and lunatic asylums. He propagated his messages, indiscriminately, in novels, plays, pamphlets, and journal articles, once even employing a fifteenth-century soldier as his mouthpiece for a diatribe against the dangerous and ridiculous practices of the Victorian medical profession (<span class="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</span>, chap. 26). His representations of the punitive tortures inflicted on inmates of prisons and lunatic asylums, which reached a blood-curdling climax in the play <span class="italic">It's Never too Late to Mend</span>, set a new standard of gruesome naturalism for the mid-Victorian period and reveal a vicarious sadism also evident, in a milder form, in many of the other scenes of violence in his novels and plays. For all his polemical combativeness and rhetorical violence, however, Reade seems to have been a soft-spoken man in private, and most of his contemporaries were perhaps more amused than affronted by his public pugnacity and conceit, viewing them, along with his odd physique and unconventional dress, as manifestations of an eccentric individualism that valuably enriched and enlivened the literary scene. Few would have dissented from Justin McCarthy's judgement that Reade:<blockquote>had a fine and noble nature under all his defects of temper and his inordinate self-esteem. No man was more chivalrous to stand by a cause which he believed to be just, or a friend whom he believed to be injured (McCarthy, 1.419)</blockquote>Convinced of his own genius, Reade made no secret of his scant regard for distinguished rival novelists such as George Eliot. He privately ranked <span class="italic">A Good Fight</span> above <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span>&#151;even though he thought Dickens &#145;the greatest genius of the century&#146;  (Elwin, 191). A hundred years after his death his novels were all out of print. Opinions about his literary stature differed widely during his lifetime, but then and for a while afterwards <span class="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</span>, with its endless succession of boisterous adventures in a sketchily picturesque medieval setting, and its topical theme of the evils of clerical celibacy, was regarded by some leading critics as perhaps the greatest historical novel in English.<br>
<br>Reade moved to 3 Blomfield Villas, Uxbridge Road, London, in 1881 and died there, after a long illness, on 11 April 1884, Good Friday. He was buried in Willesden old churchyard, alongside Laura Seymour and her husband, on 15 April. In his last years he was ostensibly &#145;converted&#146; by a Presbyterian minister, Charles Graham.<br>
