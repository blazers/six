<span class="headword">Dickson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dalzel]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>c.</em>1793&#150;1862), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47570/', "Archibald Dalzel (1740&#150;1818)")</script>, a surgeon and slave merchant, who for many years was employed by the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa, first at Ouidah and from 1791 at Cape Coast Castle, and eventually became governor-in-chief of the company's establishments on the west coast of Africa. In 1788 he was one of five delegates chosen by Liverpool common council and the merchants of the African Committee of Liverpool to give evidence against Sir William Dolben's <span class="roman">Slave Limitation Bill</span>, then going through parliament. Dalzel was also the author of <span class="italic">The History of Dahomy</span> (1793), a book which again reflected his strong anti-abolitionist sentiments.<br>
<br>It seems likely that Elizabeth Dalzel was born on the west coast of Africa. Little is known about her early education, but while she was still a teenager she visited Algiers, where her brother, Edward, was a merchant and, from 1812, agent and vice-consul for the Portuguese government. It was here that she witnessed the terrible plight of white Christians who had been captured and enslaved by Barbary pirates. In Algiers alone in 1816 there were more than 1500 of these slaves, including men, women, and children from France, Spain, Portugal, and Britain. Others were held in captivity in Tunis and Tripoli.<br>
<br>Elizabeth was so incensed by what she saw in Algiers that she furnished reports to the British press. These, in turn, attracted the attention of the Knights Liberators and Anti-Piratical Society, founded in 1814 by Admiral Sir William Sidney Smith to agitate for the abolition of the Barbary slave trade. As a result Elizabeth was made a member of the society, &#145;with the honours and privileges of a lady Foundress&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, new ser., 13, 1862, 112), and presented with a gold medal and a unanimous vote of thanks.<br>
<br>Through these and other efforts the plight of the Christian slaves in Barbary was brought to the attention of the wider public. Henry Brougham took up the issue in the House of Commons in June 1816, and in August Lord Exmouth led a naval expedition to Algiers that crushed the Algerian slave trade and resulted in the release of 3000 Christian slaves.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Dalzel was married to John Dickson, probably about 1812; their eldest known child was born in 1815. Dickson was a surgeon in the Royal Navy. Declared unfit for active service in 1839, in May 1845 he was reported to be surgeon to the bashaw of Tripoli, where he and Elizabeth had made their home. Elizabeth died a widow at Tripoli on 30 April 1862, aged about seventy. Her will, executed in February of the previous year, mentions four sons and two daughters.<br>
