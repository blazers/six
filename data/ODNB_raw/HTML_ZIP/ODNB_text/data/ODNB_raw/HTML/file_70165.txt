<span class="headword">Kalm,  Pehr</span>  (1716&#150;1779), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in &Aring;ngermanland, Sweden, in March 1716, the son of Gabriel Kalm, minister of Korsn&auml;s chapel, N&auml;rpes, Vasa county, in &Ouml;sterbotten, and Catharina Ross. His father died before Kalm was born, but with the help of relatives Kalm was able to attend elementary school in Vasa, and to matriculate in 1735 at &Aring;bo Academy, both in the Swedish-speaking part of Finland and the latter then a flourishing centre for the study of natural history. In 1740 he gained the patronage of Friherre Sten Carl Bielke who took him to live on his estate near Uppsala, at which university Kalm matriculated on 5 December 1740. Here his teachers were Linnaeus and Anders Celsius. Their example and the support of Bielke, who was keenly interested in natural history, particularly as applied to agricultural improvement, led to Kalm's undertaking several journeys for research purposes between 1740 and 1745 through Finland, Sweden, Russia, and Ukraine. He graduated doctor of natural history and economics of &Aring;bo Academy in 1746 and became on 31 August 1747 its first professor of <i>oeconomie</i>, a subject which included mineralogy, botany, zoology, and chemistry, and their economic application. At the instigation of Linnaeus, who had himself hoped to make the journey, and with the support of the &Aring;bo Academy, Kalm travelled in North America between 1747 and 1751 with explicit instructions to gather information and specimens such as seed which would be of practical economic use to Sweden. To this end he was to go particularly to areas in the north with climates similar to that of Sweden. Setting off in November 1747 he travelled first to England. The English leg was always seen as an important part of his journey since British botanists had had considerable experience and success in introducing North American plants and they had important contacts with American botanists. He stayed and met with British scientists, particularly Peter Collinson, a botanist with American contacts who introduced Kalm to the Royal Society, Mark Catesby, a botanist with extensive American contacts, Philip Miller, keeper of the Chelsea Physic Garden, and John Mitchell, the Virginian natural historian, then in London, who was Kalm's chief guide in England. He made a visit into the Chilterns to see William Ellis whose works on agricultural improvements he had read in &Aring;bo and Uppsala, but came away sharing the poor opinion of Ellis held by some of his neighbours. He sent quantities of seed and specimens back to Sweden and made detailed notes of all he saw.<br>
<br>The War of the Austrian Succession disrupted shipping but Kalm finally sailed for America on 6 August 1748, arriving there in November. He visited Philadelphia, where on 1 January 1750 he married Anna Margareta (<i>d</i>. 1787), daughter of Johan Sj&ouml;man, commissioner at the Stockholm arsenal, and widow of John Sandin, dean of the Swedish congregation in Philadelphia. He was warmly received into the leading scientific circles in Philadelphia. He then went on to Canada, where he arrived in the summer of 1749, and travelled extensively in areas of British and French settlement. He was particularly well received in New France, then the focus of much French scientific attention. He reached home in 1751, having been away four instead of the projected two years. He brought back plants and seeds of medicinal use and of benefit to agriculture and industry. All were planted enthusiastically, notably in his new botanical garden at &Aring;bo. Although few flourished the practice of systematic cultivation and experiment with plants gained wide currency among the well educated and the well born and his efforts were in this way very influential.<br>
<br>Kalm reached a wider audience through his publications. Reports of his travels were published in Swedish, German, Dutch, and English in the eighteenth century, some in his lifetime, and a French and other editions followed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These reports, although containing detailed and pertinent observations, were less detailed than his journals (fair copy in Helsinki University Library), which were published in the twentieth century in Swedish and English and further consolidated his reputation. All his writings show his thirst for information, and his thoughtfulness in interpreting what he saw, particularly in the light of his scientific and medical knowledge. He was the first European traveller with scientific knowledge to visit and report on many areas; his report of Niagara Falls, for example, published by Benjamin Franklin and John Bartram in 1751, was the first English description of the falls. Though his primary aim was scientific Kalm was no less acute an observer of the economic, ethnographic, and social characteristics of the lands through which he travelled, and his comments on Native Americans, European colonists, and the relations between the two are of particular interest on both sides of the Atlantic. Kalm intended a Flora Canadiensis, but this eagerly awaited work was never completed. Most of the material for it was recorded in his travel diaries and Kalm's students and Linnaeus and his students made considerable use of the information in their writings.<br>
<br>In 1763 Kalm declined the offer of the chair of botany from the academy of sciences in St Petersburg and remained at &Aring;bo, where he took his duties very seriously. Under his direction 146 dissertations were completed. His emphasis on the applied and the empirical and on communicating in Swedish set his school apart from the old academic tradition and foreshadowed the later establishment of agricultural, economic, and technical colleges. Most of his students became clergymen and, by adopting new practices on their church farms, helped to raise the standards of Finnish agriculture and husbandry. He was made doctor of theology at Lund University in 1768. He died on 16 November 1779 in &Aring;bo.<br>
<br>Kalm was important as a link between the natural history communities of England, North America, and Sweden, the last being in the mid-eighteenth century of crucial importance because of Linnaeus. Scientific links between Sweden and England were well established, not least by Linnaeus himself and his pupil Daniel Solander, Joseph Banks's secretary. Connections between North America and England were similarly well developed, for example by John Ellis, Peter Collinson, and John Mitchell; but Kalm linked all three. These links make him important in the development of eighteenth-century natural history, and the quality and early date of his descriptions, economic and social as well as botanical, give them continuing importance as a historical source.<br>
