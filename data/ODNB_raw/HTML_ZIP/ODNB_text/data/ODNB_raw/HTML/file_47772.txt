<span class="headword">Tod,  Isabella Maria Susan</span>  (1836&#150;1896), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 18 May 1836 in Edinburgh. Her father, James Banks Tod, was a Scottish merchant, and her mother, Maria Isabella Waddell, was a native of co. Monaghan. Tod was always proud of her Scottish blood and frequently alluded to the fact that one of her ancestors signed the copy of the solemn league and covenant at Holywood, co. Down, in 1646. Little else is known of her family background or circumstances, though she had at least one brother, Henry, a merchant who lived in London. She was educated at home, apparently by her mother, who had a profound influence on her life. By the 1860s she was living in Belfast with her mother, who remained with her until her death in 1877. For a period Tod earned her living by writing leaders for the Belfast newspaper the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>.<br>
<br>Tod first entered public life in 1867, when her paper &#145;On advanced education for girls of the upper and middle classes&#146; was read for her at a meeting of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science. The immediate result of this meeting was Tod's organization of a committee to promote alterations in the married women's property laws. In 1867 she was instrumental in establishing in Belfast the Ladies' Institute, whose original function was to provide classes for young women interested in improving their education and hence their employment prospects. The institute organized lectures on such subjects as modern languages, history, and astronomy, and it also petitioned the Queen's College, Belfast, eventually successfully, to allow women to take their examinations. Tod played a leading role in ensuring the inclusion of girls in the <span class="roman">Intermediate Education Act</span> (1878), which proved an important step toward making university education available to women. She was also instrumental in setting up the Ulster Schoolmistresses' Association to look after the interests of girls' education.<br>
<br>The difficulties involved in securing educational rights for women led Tod to believe that the acquisition of the franchise was the clearest way to secure change for women in society. In 1871 she organized the first suffrage society in the country, the North of Ireland Women's Suffrage Committee. Her speeches were widely reported in the suffrage journals and daily newspapers of both Ireland and England. She shared platforms with, and was a friend of, many of the leading English suffragists, such as Helen Blackburn, Josephine Butler, and Lydia Becker. She campaigned to ensure that women were granted the municipal franchise and was rewarded for her efforts by the granting of this franchise to Belfast women in 1887, eleven years before women in other Irish towns were bestowed with the same privilege.<br>
<br>From the beginning of her career Tod was a strong temperance advocate, and in 1874, with Margaret Byers, she formed the Belfast Women's Temperance Association. She established a Belfast branch of the Ladies National Association (LNA) to campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> and served on the executive committee of the London-based LNA until 1889. 1886 saw the introduction of Gladstone's first <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> for Ireland. The bill was seen by Tod as the instrument that would destroy all her work. In later years she was to write:<blockquote>I can scarcely write of the sickening shock of the Home Rule proposals of 1886. Knowing Ireland thoroughly, I knew that all the social work in which I had taken so prominent a part for twenty years was in danger, and that most of it could not exist for a day under a petty legislature of the character which would be inevitable. &hellip; I shrank in horror from the revival of the religious and racial difference which was certain to ensue. (<span class="italic">The Queen</span>)</blockquote>As always, Tod threw herself into a campaign to ensure that the bill would not pass. The resulting crusade, which found her canvassing in Devon, Cornwall, and London, not only lost her a number of friends in the suffrage movement but also seriously damaged her health. The last ten years of her life were devoted primarily to ensuring that home rule would not become a reality.<br>
<br>Isabella Tod died at her home at 71 Botanic Avenue, Belfast, on 8 December 1896. The cause of her death was given as pulmonary illness, an illness, it was claimed, that was brought on and exacerbated by the stress of her campaigns against home rule. She was buried in Balmoral cemetery, Belfast.<br>
