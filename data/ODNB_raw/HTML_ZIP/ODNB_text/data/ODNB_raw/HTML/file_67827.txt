<span class="headword">Buck,  Samuel</span>  (1696&#150;1779), <span class="occ">topographical draughtsman, engraver, and print publisher</span>, is usually said to have been born in Richmond, Yorkshire, though firm evidence of his birth place is lacking. Hauxwell, 4&frac12; miles south of Richmond, has also been suggested. His father was living near Elvil Bridge, Durham, in 1722, but no other information about his parents is known. Although Buck's familiarity with shorthand could suggest an original intention to enter the legal profession, by 1719 he was known to the Leeds antiquary Ralph Thoresby as an amateur, though useful, artist. Thoresby introduced him to John Warburton, an antiquary then engaged in writing a county topography for Yorkshire. Sketches made by Samuel Buck in 1719 and 1720 for plates intended for this later abandoned topography can be found in the British Library.<br>
<br>In 1720 Buck published proposals for two large engraved prospects of Leeds and Wakefield. These two prints proved to be the first in a series of town prospects. Eventually there were ten in the first series (1720&#150;25), the others being of York, Newcastle upon Tyne, Durham, Stockton-on-Tees, Maidstone (two), Sunderland, and Lincoln. Measuring on average about 410 mm &times; 1000 mm, each was printed on two sheets, and no more were printed off than were subscribed for. Today they are extremely rare.<br>
<br>By this time Buck had moved to London. The first address he gave for subscribers was the White Swan, Brownlow Street, off High Holborn. Later he operated from his brother's address at the Golden Buck, Warwick Street, near Golden Square, Soho, and also at the Golden Buck, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, and at 1 Garden Court, Middle Temple. The Green Canister, next to the Crown and Anchor in the Strand, seems to have been his residence. From his arrival in London he worked closely with the fellows of the Society of Antiquaries, attending their meetings at The Mitre tavern in the Strand and showing them specimens of his town prospects. In 1724 and 1725 he accompanied the society's secretary, William Stukeley, on two of his antiquarian peregrinations. The resulting drawings are in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. A view of the gatehouse of Thornton College, Lincoln, carries a Stukeley inscription: &#145;Mr. Saml. Buck now with me whom I engaged to begin his drawings of Antiquitys&#146;  (Gough Top. 17512, fol. 56, Bodleian Library, Oxford).<br>
<br>In January 1724 Buck issued proposals for publishing a collection of twenty-four perspective views (&#145;antiquities&#146;) in the county of York. These views were published in 1726. A number of the prints were based on sketches he had made when with Warburton. Thanks largely to the fellows of the Society of Antiquities, who had encouraged its publication, it was a success. In proposals issued in May 1726 Buck announced that he was working on a second set of twenty-four antiquities, representing &#145;remarkable ruins&#146; in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, places drawn when he accompanied William Stukeley. These were published in 1727, the same year he married Catherine Faussett, on 20 April. By this date Buck had developed a more ambitious plan. In November 1726 he announced his intention of systematically recording ruins throughout England. The castles, religious foundations, and other remains of antiquity throughout the kingdom, he argued, were in a lamentable condition. He would &#145;rescue the mangled remains&#146; of &#145;these aged &amp; venerable edifices from the inexorable jaws of time&#146;  (S. Buck, &#145;Proposals for the publication of &hellip; twenty-four views of castles &hellip; in the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham&#146;, 1 Nov 1726, copy in priv. coll.), by visiting and recording them.<br>
<br>Samuel's brother, <a name="cosubject_67827"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Buck</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1724&#150;1759)<span class="occ"></span>, was associated with this project from the start, taking in subscriptions at the Golden Buck, Warwick Street, Soho. It is assumed that he was born in or near Richmond, Yorkshire, though the earliest mention of him is not until 1724. In the summer of 1727 Nathaniel accompanied Samuel on a peregrination of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire. The third antiquities collection thus consists of ruins in those counties, and the views are signed either &#145;S. B. delin. N. B. sculp.&#146; or vice versa. In 1728 the brothers announced their plan to undertake the remaining counties of northern England, but they discovered enough recordable ruins in Durham and Northumberland for the following year's set of twenty-four, and Cumberland and Westmorland had to wait. In 1729&#150;31 they took their sketch-boards to the midlands, between 1732 and 1736 they covered the counties in the south of England and also in Monmouthshire, in 1737 they covered the counties of East Anglia, and in 1738 they completed England by dealing with Cumberland and Westmorland. Finally they produced sets for Wales, apparently touring the counties of Wales in 1739&#150;41. With the publication in 1742 of Anglesey, Caernarvonshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Merioneth, Montgomeryshire, and Radnor, the antiquities project was completed.<br>
<br>This project constituted only half of the Buck brothers' enterprise. From 1728 they had worked on a parallel project: producing and publishing a series of long prospects of English and Welsh &#145;Cities, Sea-ports, and Capital Towns&#146;. In this second, &#145;principal&#146; series of townscapes each prospect consisted of an image on a single sheet measuring 305 mm &times; 775 mm. They are taken in most cases from the nearby countryside, 1 or 2 miles from the town, and from an elevated spot where possible. In the cases of London and of Greenwich and Deptford (two views that abut to form one) they are taken from several viewpoints. All the town prospects carry a numbered key and most are accompanied by a diligently compiled panegyric. The Bucks' usual practice was to market the town prospects in sets of six.<br>
<br>The drawings for the town prospects were usually made on the same peregrinations as those for the antiquities. After the completion of the antiquities, however, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Leicestershire were revisited and their principal towns recorded. Because several towns in the north had been dealt with in the first series, the Bucks left that area of England until last. They then turned their attention to Wales in 1748, publishing prospects of the six principal Welsh towns. The set, which was supposed to conclude the project, consisting of London in five sheets plus a sheet for Portsmouth, appeared on 11 September 1749. However, on the same day the brothers issued the finest of all their town prospects&#151;two long views of Richmond, Yorkshire, the town with which they had been so closely associated. These were surely intended as the grand finale. Nevertheless, in 1752 they published second views of Birmingham and Oxford. Nathaniel died some time between 1759 and 14 May 1774, when Garden Court, Middle Temple, was to be disposed of on behalf of his executrix, Mrs Rebecca Buck.<br>
<br>Samuel Buck continued to advertise and sell his antiquities and town prospects. He advertised that he would instruct young ladies and gentlemen in their own houses in the art of drawing and painting in oils and watercolours; he made flower drawings; he sold drawings specially designed for young beginners to copy and improve their skills; he offered to clean and mend pictures; and he exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Free Society, and the Society of Artists. Two years before he died he issued proposals for a set of four perspective views in Yorkshire from drawings made on the spot by himself.<br>
<br>In their proposals for the Glamorgan, Brecknockshire, and Cardiganshire antiquities the Bucks firmly stated that they &#145;do design and draw the Views on the spot and engrave their own Copper-Plates&#146;  (copy inserted in collections for a third edition of Gough's <span class="italic">British Topography</span>, vol. 4, 161, in the Bodleian Library). These claims must be treated with caution. The Bucks were not the only people involved. Other artists were employed to strengthen their drawings, to draw the staffage, and generally to bring their awkward drawings to life. These artists included Thomas Rosse, Hubert-Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot, Jean-Baptiste Claude Chatelain, Peter Monamy, and probably Samuel Scott. The style of engraving changes markedly from time to time. Engravers employed for the first series of town prospects included John Harris and Gerard Vandergucht. Chatelain may have been the engraver of the various towns that concluded the principal series.<br>
<br>In his proposals for the prospects of Durham and Stockton in the first series Buck announced: &#145;Any Gentleman may have his Seat drawn and engraved by the same Hand at a reasonable Rate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newcastle Weekly Courant</span>, 15 Sept 1722). He made drawings of Bolton in Yorkshire, and prints of Chilham Castle in Kent, Powderham Castle in Devon, Melton Constable in Norfolk, Aston in Warwickshire, and Worksop Manor in Nottinghamshire. In Cornwall the Bucks produced four views of St Michael's Mount.<br>
<br>Samuel Buck's final years were spent in poverty. Richard Gough supported him out of his own pocket and encouraged his friends to follow suit, publishing an appeal in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and elsewhere, and attempting to present it in the chamber of the Society of Antiquaries. It provoked a generous response, and in his last six months Buck was free from financial anxiety. He died at eighty-three on 17 August 1779, and was buried in the churchyard of St Clement Danes three days later.<br>
<br>The copper plates for printing the antiquities and the principal series of town prospects were acquired by the Fleet Street printmaker Robert Sayer. Sayer reissued the prints in 1774, making them available in single sheets, or bound into three volumes with the comprehensive title <span class="italic">Buck's Antiquities</span>. The Sayer impressions have the original imprints but can be distinguished from the impressions made by Buck by the plate numbers Sayer added at the top right corner. They are listed in print catalogues as late as 1813, by which date some of the prints had been on the market for eighty-seven years. Only the London prospect was updated, though not thoroughly.<br>
<br>Large numbers of preparatory drawings for Buck's antiquities and town prospects survive in libraries, art galleries, museums, and record offices, drawn by the Bucks themselves or by the artists they employed. Some are inscribed with shorthand notes. Though the Buck brothers were not the only ones producing views of antiquities and town prospects in the eighteenth century they were much the most prolific. They published 428 engravings of monasteries, abbeys, castles, and other ruins, three unsigned engravings of Fountains Abbey, two town plans, an engraving of Bristol high cross, and eighty-seven long prospects of English and Welsh towns. Collectively their engravings constitute a national survey of ruins of the period, and provide us with an indispensable record of what English and Welsh towns looked like before the industrial revolution.<br>
