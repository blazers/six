<span class="headword">Crealock,  John North</span>  (1836&#150;1895), <span class="occ">army officer and artist</span>, was born on 21 May 1836, the second son of William Betton Crealock of Langeston, Littleham, near Bideford. Educated at Rugby School, he was commissioned as ensign in the 95th (Derbyshire) regiment on 13 October 1854 and promoted lieutenant on 9 February 1855. From May 1855 to June 1856 he was inspector of musketry at Aldershot. He served with his regiment in the Indian mutiny (1858&#150;9), and was present at the siege and capture of Kotah, Chundaree, and Gwalior, and at the battle of Kotah-ki-sarai, where he was wounded. He was mentioned three times in dispatches. On 6 May 1859 he was promoted captain and was aide-de-camp to the lieutenant-general, Bombay, from 16 December 1862 to 11 March 1864. He passed staff college in 1868. In London, on 20 May 1869, he married Marion, the daughter of Morgan Lloyd; they had three sons.<br>
<br>Crealock was promoted brevet major on 5 July 1872, becoming a major in the 95th regiment on 30 March 1875. Between 1870 and 1878 he held a series of staff appointments, first as aide-de-camp to the general officer commanding the forces, headquarters, Ireland, between 1 August 1870 and 15 November 1871, then as deputy assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot from 16 November 1871 to 19 May 1875, and finally as deputy assistant quartermaster-general, intelligence branch of the army at Adair House, London, from 30 September 1877 to February 1878.<br>
<br>On 25 February 1878 Crealock was appointed assistant military secretary, Cape of Good Hope, to Lieutenant-General the Hon. F. Thesiger (later Lord Chelmsford), the officer commanding in South Africa, and accompanied him to the Cape. In recognition of his services in the Cape Frontier War of 1878 he was made a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 11 November 1878. During the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War he continued on Chelmsford's personal staff and was promoted military secretary in May 1879. He served as senior staff officer to the Eshowe relief column and was slightly wounded at the battle of Gingindlovu on 2 April 1879. He was present at the battle of Ulundi on 4 July 1879 which ended the campaign. He returned with Chelmsford to England when the general resigned his command in July 1879, and was made CB on 27 November 1879.<br>
<br>During his service in South Africa, Crealock had been Chelmsford's constant companion and was suspected of wielding undue influence over the general and of shielding him by withholding information. Yet he was not noted for his efficiency as military secretary nor for the legibility of his dispatches. Crealock was privately critical of the general's military capabilities, but he always staunchly defended him in public, gaining a reputation for haughtiness, facetiousness, and sharp retorts. His overbearing manner did nothing to ease Chelmsford's always difficult relations with the local colonial officials upon whom he relied for transport and supplies, and alienated many of his fellow officers.<br>
<br>Promoted lieutenant-colonel in the 95th regiment on 21 July 1880 and colonel in the army on 11 November 1882, Crealock commanded his regiment (which became the 2nd battalion, Sherwood Foresters, in 1881) from 1880 to 1885 while it was deployed in Gibraltar, Egypt, and India. During the Egyptian expedition of 1882 he was commandant at Alexandria and at El Mex. Subsequently he held senior staff appointments, first as assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot from 1 April 1887 to 22 May 1890, and then from 23 May 1890 to 29 February 1892 as assistant quartermaster-general, headquarters of the army. On 24 December 1891 he was promoted major-general, and on 1 April 1892 given command of the 3rd infantry brigade at Aldershot. Crealock returned to India as major-general, Madras, first-class district commander, a post he held from 13 November 1893 until his retirement on 5 March 1895. He died at Rawalpindi on 24 April 1895. His body was brought back to England and was buried in Littleham churchyard.<br>
<br>Crealock excelled at watercolour paintings and sketches, many executed while on campaign and, presumably, to the detriment of his military duties. On his death, 189 of his watercolours of the eastern Cape, Natal, and Zululand, executed during 1878&#150;9, were given to the Sherwood Foresters Museum, Nottingham. They depict landscapes, camp scenes, forts, battles, and military and civilian personalities (both black and white) during the Cape Frontier War and the Anglo-Zulu War. They are a valuable historical record of the campaigns and of the South African countryside, besides being of pleasing artistic quality. Their detail, wit, and accurate sense of topography have been commended by historians, botanists, and geographers alike.<br>
