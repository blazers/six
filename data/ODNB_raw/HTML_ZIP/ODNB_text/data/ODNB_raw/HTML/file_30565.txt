<span class="headword">Ball,  John</span>  (1861&#150;1940), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born on 24 December 1861 at Hoylake, Cheshire, the second son of John Ball (<i>d</i>. 1905) and his wife, Margaret Parry. The father was of yeoman farmer stock and the owner of the Royal Hotel at Hoylake, which became the headquarters of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club when the course was laid out in 1869. The boy was therefore brought up with golf on his doorstep, and his early promise was such that at the age of sixteen he entered for the open championship in 1878 and finished sixth.<br>
<br>Ball's career in big matches began in 1883, and he became widely known when the amateur championship was founded in 1885; but it was not until 1888 that he came into his own by beating J. E. Laidlay at Prestwick by five and four in the final of the amateur championship. He won the championship again at Hoylake in 1890, and in that same year&#151;on what Dr Laidlaw Purves called &#145;a great day for golf&#146;&#151;he won the open championship at Prestwick with a score of 164; he beat all the professionals, a feat hitherto deemed impossible for an amateur. In 1892 he tied for second place in the open championship at Muirfield, which was won by another Hoylake amateur, Harold Hilton, and he also won the amateur championship for the third time at Sandwich. In 1894 he won it for the fourth time at Hoylake, and in 1899 won again at Prestwick.<br>
<br>After the South African War, when he served with the Denbighshire yeomanry, Ball's play showed no perceptible falling off; but it was not until 1907 that he won the amateur championship again, this time at St Andrews. In 1910 at Hoylake he won it for the seventh time, and in 1912 at Westward Ho! won for the eighth time, a record wholly without parallel. Of these matches the most memorable were that of 1894 at Hoylake with S. Mure Fergusson, in which Ball played a famous brassy shot over the cross bunkers to the Dun (then the seventeenth) hole and won by a hole, and the Prestwick final of 1899 against his great Scottish competitor F. G. Tait, when Ball won at the thirty-seventh hole. Having been at one time five down, Ball retrieved himself and stood one up with two to play: at the thirty-fifth hole both played historic recovery shots, Tait from a watery bunker and Ball from hard wet sand close to the boarded edge of the same hazard. Tait saved the match with a three at the home hole, but at the thirty-seventh Ball laid an iron shot about 8 feet from the hole and holed the putt for a winning three. In 1912 he beat Abe Mitchell, later a famous professional, at the thirty-eighth hole, but perhaps the finest golf he ever played in his later years was in the final of 1910, when he beat Collinson Charleton Aylmer by ten and nine.<br>
<br>Ball's lesser successes were innumerable: he was three times Irish open amateur champion (1893, 1894, and 1899); he won the St George's cup at Sandwich, then considered the amateur stroke play championship, four years running (1888&#150;91); and he regularly played for England against Scotland from the first international match in 1902 until 1911.<br>
<br>Ball's style was eminently characteristic, with a peculiar underhand grip of the right hand, but the swing was a perfect model of grace and rhythm. He was a magnificent iron player and he set a new standard of accuracy in long iron shots right up to the flag. If he had a comparatively weak spot, it was on the green: he was inclined to miss short putts. As a match player he had the most indomitable spirit and seemed to revel in a close finish. No golfer has ever come close to his record of eight amateur championships plus an open championship, nor is ever likely to do so.<br>
<br>A quiet, reserved man, and always something of a puritan in golfing matters, Ball had a great dislike of publicity, but none the less a remarkable power for inspiring hero worship, especially at Hoylake. In his later years he parted with his interest in the Royal Hotel there, and went to live at Lygan-y-wern, near Holywell, Flintshire, with his unmarried sister Elizabeth and their housekeeper Nellie Williams, whom he married in July 1932, a development which severed Ball's remaining family ties. From Flintshire he made very occasional forays back to Hoylake, not least to witness the amateur championship of 1939, where the beautiful condition of the fairways (&#145;damned croquet lawns&#146;) earned his particular scorn. One of the greatest and most romantic figures in the history of English golf, John Ball died at Lygan-y-wern on 2 December 1940. His wife survived him.<br>
