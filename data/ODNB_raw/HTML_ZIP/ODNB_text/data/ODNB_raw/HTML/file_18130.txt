<span class="headword">Marshall,  Charles</span>  (1637&#150;1698), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and apothecary</span>, was born at Bristol in June 1637. He noted in his short journal that his &#145;education and bringing up was after the strictest manner of religion&#146;, his parents &#145;being such as feared the Lord&#146;  (Marshall, sig. d1<i>r</i>). He went on to recount how at the age of five or six he started to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and that at about eleven or twelve years he accompanied his mother to meetings of Independents and Baptists. As he grew older he wrote of his spiritual state, &#145;I became like the solitary Desart, and mourned like a Dove without a Mate&#146;  (ibid., sig. d2<i>r</i>). About 1654 he joined a group of people who met weekly for fasting and prayer. John Audland and John Camm attended one of these meetings, and Marshall describes how he was convinced by the former's &#145;powerful Ministry&#146; and became a Quaker  (ibid., sig. d4<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>On 6 May 1662 Marshall married Hannah, daughter of Edward Prince, an ironmonger of Bristol. She too became a Quaker, and in 1664 they were convicted under the <span class="roman">Act for Banishment</span> for attending Quaker meetings and committed to prison, along with 217 others. In 1668 they settled at Tytherington, Wiltshire. They had a number of children: two sons, Beulah and Charles, and two daughters, Sarah, who became the wife of Richard Scott, and another who married &#145;Ja: Honour&#146;.<br>
<br>Marshall appears to have been an apothecary and published a number of medical works. In 1670 he wrote <span class="italic">A Plain and Candid Relation of the Nature, Use, and Dose of Several Approved Medicines</span>, in which he described a number of his preparations such as &#145;Spiritus Sedativus&#146; and &#145;Expulsive Cordial&#146; that were to be sold at his house near Castlegate in Bristol  (pp. 10, 13). This was published again in 1681, with changes and additions, under a similar title. It contained some general guidelines for the preservation of health, and was written while Marshall was living in London at the Golden Bull, Winchester Street. Letters of recommendation for his medicines, subscribed by Richard Snead with a few lines from William Penn, were printed as a broadside in 1681.<br>
<br>In 1670, Marshall later wrote, he &#145;faithfully gave up Liberty, Estate and Relations&#146; and began preaching in Bristol and the surrounding areas  (Marshall, sig. e3<i>r</i>). He went on to describe how he &#145;received&#146; a &#145;Commission from God&#146; to travel through the nation  (ibid., sig. e3<i>r</i>), writing that &#145;the Word of the Lord was as a Fire in my Bones, to run through the Land&#146;  (ibid., sig. f5<i>v</i>). In the space of two years he held 400 meetings in most parts of England, returning home only twice&#151;once through illness, and once owing to the death of a favourite child. Through his work he noted that &#145;Thousands received the Word of Life, and many were added to the Church in divers places&#146;  (ibid., sig. f6<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Marshall recounted that during his travels he was not persecuted at all and &#145;no Man was suffered to lay Hands on me, to stop my Way&#146;  (Marshall, sig. f6<i>r</i>). However, some years later, in December 1674, while at prayer in a meeting at Claverham, Somerset, he was injured when justices violently dragged him through the gallery rail; he was later fined for non-attendance at church.<br>
<br>On his return to Bristol, Marshall worked hard to counteract the divisions made by the Quaker separatists John Story and John Wilkinson, whom he believed were trying to oppose &#145;Order and Discipline&#146; by &#145;endeavouring to lay waste the Quarterly, Monthly, Yearly, and Women's-Meetings, by opposing the settled methods thereof; calling them, <i>Forms</i> and <i>an Idol</i>&#146;  (Marshall, sig. f7<i>v</i>). He took part with George Fox in a large meeting at Bristol in 1677 at the house of William Rogers, another separatist. George Whitehead noted that Marshall &#145;Zealously often Testified against the Spirit of <i>Division</i> and <i>Separation</i>, and against <i>Treacherous Apostates</i> and <i>Sowers of Discord</i>&#146;  (ibid., sig. b2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Marshall lost much property by distraints for tithes, and in 1682 or 1683 was prosecuted by the vicar of Tytherington and committed to the Fleet prison, where he remained for two years. During his incarceration he wrote <span class="italic">A Tender Visitation in the Love of God</span> (1684), addressed to his parish neighbours and the inhabitants of Wiltshire, Gloucester, and Bristol. Once released and back in Winchester Street, London, he tended the sick &#145;and was frequently concerned with some in the Government, on behalf of his suffering People&#146;  (Marshall, sig. i3<i>r</i>). He appears to have become a very important leading Friend, as in 1697 he was a chief signatory along with William Penn, Leonard Fell, and others to the postscript to an epistle of John Bellers regarding Bellers's proposals for a college of industry.<br>
<br>A number of testimonies to Marshall's good character exist. George Whitehead called him &#145;a Loving and Tender hearted Man&#146; who &#145;was truly Tender and Zealous of the Glory of God&#146;  (Marshall, sig. b2<i>r</i>). His wife, Hannah, wrote that &#145;He was a Lover of the Poor, and a Friend to the Rich, often putting the latter, at their well-furnished Tables, in mind of the former&#146;. She added that he visited the poor, &#145;supplying the Sick, with Advice and Physick; the Hungry, with Bread; and the Naked with Clothes&#146;  (ibid., sig. c6<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Marshall was the author of many works, chiefly epistles containing warnings and reproofs, twenty-six of which are included in his posthumous collection of works, <span class="italic">Sion's Travellers Comforted</span> (1704). This also contains his journal, a preface by William Penn, and testimonies by his wife and other Friends. Works included in it are <span class="italic">The Way of Life Revealed, and the Way of Death Discovered</span> (1674) and <span class="italic">The Trumpet of the Lord</span> (1675); the former tract contained a discussion of the fall of man together with the Quaker idea of salvation, via the inner light, which Marshall described as &#145;a measure of the divine fullness&#146;, which was &#145;communicated to, and placed in all immortal souls&#146;  (p. 14). Along with Thomas Camm, Marshall also edited <span class="italic">The Memory of the Righteous Revived</span> (1689), a collection of writings and testimonies concerning the Quakers John Camm and John Audland.<br>
<br>Marshall's last journey was to Bristol at the beginning of 1698. On his return to London he fell ill and was moved to the house of John Padley, near the riverside at Southwark, where after four months he died of a fever and consumption on 15 November 1698, aged sixty-one. The Quaker digest registers state that he was buried at Chequer Alley, London, two days later. The esteem in which he was held can be seen from a letter from John Tomkins to Sir John Rodes, dated 18 November 1698, concerning his funeral, in which it was noted that &#145;it's thought to be the greatest appearance of Friends at his burial &hellip; as of any yet, exceeding in number either G.F's, S.C. or F.S. [George Fox, Stephen Crisp, Francis Stamper]&#146;  (&#145;Large gatherings of Friends&#146;, 8). Marshall left a will in which he bequeathed estates in Pennsylvania to his son Beulah, his shares in mines in Cumberland to his other son, Charles, and his property at Tytherington and Bromhill to his wife, who survived him.<br>
