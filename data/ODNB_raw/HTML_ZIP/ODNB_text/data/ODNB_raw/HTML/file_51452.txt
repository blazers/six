<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Calvert,  Charles Alexander</span>  (1828&#150;1879), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in London on 28 February 1828, the son of William Henry Calvert (<i>d</i>. 1857), a silk merchant, who claimed descent from George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore. A. W. Ward's assertion  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) that Calvert attended King's College School is not substantiated by that institution's records; his education was undoubtedly affected by reverses in his father's business, as was his aspiration to take holy orders in the Church of England. Calvert's father was a man of deep but unconventional piety, who had his son &#145;baptized into no less than four different denominations&#146;  (Calvert, 18). As a young man Charles was drawn to the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, as a result of which he felt that he could no longer accept the tenets of the Church of England. In later life he found a religious refuge in Unitarianism. Having abandoned the idea of a religious vocation, he was articled to a solicitor, but gave up the law in favour of commerce and became a traveller for a company dealing chiefly in straw hats.<h2>
<a name="Earlytheatricalcareer"></a>Early theatrical career</h2>Calvert's interest in the theatre was awakened by Samuel Phelps, whose performances at Sadler's Wells he attended, as he did W. C. Macready's farewell London seasons. He entered the theatrical profession in 1852 and gained early experience in Weymouth (with E. A. Sothern), in Southampton (where he met his future wife, <a href="#cosubject_38746">Adelaide Biddles [<i>see below</i>]</a>), and in south Wales. He made his London d&eacute;but, as Leonardo, prince of Mantua, in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Wife</span> (24 September 1855) at the Surrey Theatre under the managers Richard Shepherd and William Creswick, who aspired to emulate, south of the river, Phelps's regime at Sadler's Wells. The repertory was varied, including melodrama, Shakespeare, and an adaptation of Henry Mayhew's <span class="italic">London Labour and London Poor</span> by J. B. Johnstone, entitled <span class="italic">How we Live in the World of London</span> (March 1856). On 31 August 1856 Calvert married Adelaide Biddles at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, after which she joined the Surrey company. In April 1857 Calvert used an inheritance of &pound;500 to establish the Allied Metropolitan Dramatic Company, whose touring venues included Southampton and Manchester. The venture was not a financial success, and in the autumn of 1858 the Calverts returned to the Surrey, but not before Charles had gained his first experience of management and established contacts in the city to which he was to devote the greater part of his professional life&#151;Manchester.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1859 Calvert was engaged by the legendary John Knowles at the Theatre Royal, Manchester; he impressed as an actor (alternating Othello and Iago with David H. Jones), but it was in his capacity as stage manager that he made the greatest mark. Undeterred by Knowles's penny-pinching regime, Calvert staged <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (November 1859) with Scandinavian-style costumes (refashioned from the wardrobe), graphic scenery (painted over old stock), atmospheric lighting, and extensive use of music. The result was hailed as a triumph. Calvert's relationship with Knowles was never easy and he spent periods in Newcastle and Glasgow; he also wrote a number of plays, of which <span class="italic">Rube the Showman</span> was the most successful, but his industriousness combined with his highly strung temperament resulted in the first of the nervous illnesses from which he was to suffer for the rest of his life.<h2>
<a name="ProductionsofShakespeare"></a>Productions of Shakespeare</h2>To a man of Calvert's intelligence and social awareness, the opportunities afforded by the expansion and growing wealth of Manchester must have been clearly apparent. Fortunately, a group of local businessmen launched an enterprise well suited to Calvert's aspirations, and in the autumn of 1864 he became manager of the new Prince's Theatre. The nature of Calvert's involvement in the Prince's fluctuated (for a time he held a significant financial stake), but essentially between 1864 and 1875 the architect Edward Salomon's beautiful and intimate theatre provided Calvert with the base for a management which was unrivalled in the provinces and not consistently matched in the metropolis. The cornerstone of Calvert's achievement was Shakespeare&#151;from the opening production of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (15 October 1864) to <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (13 February 1865), <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (2 September 1865), <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (10 September 1866), <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (8 September 1869), <span class="italic">Richard III</span> (31 January 1870), <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> (6 March 1871), <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (18 August 1871), <span class="italic">Henry V</span> (16 September 1872), <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (8 September 1873), and <span class="italic">Henry IV Part 2</span> (28 September 1874). Although it was Samuel Phelps whose work had fired Calvert's interest in the theatre (he appeared in two of Calvert's revivals, <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> and <span class="italic">Henry IV Part 2</span>), Charles Kean was a stronger influence. Calvert fully subscribed to Kean's antiquarianism and the place in the theatre of the allied arts of painting (the Telbins, the Gordons, and the Grieves provided scenery) and music (Clay, Macfarren, and Sullivan composed settings and background music). Several of Calvert's published acting editions reveal his indebtedness to Kean, but they also show an awareness of textual scholarship. Beddoes Peacock recalled Calvert's scrutiny of the Folio text, and in A. W. Ward, successively professor of history and English literature and language and principal of Owens College, Manchester, Calvert had recourse to a scholar of dramatic literature. The monumental task of mounting these revivals meant that Calvert's own performances were often under-prepared, but his capacity for original interpretation was evident in his sympathetic Shylock and reflective Henry V. The production of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> was bought by the New York managers Jarrett and Palmer&#151;as <span class="italic">Richard III</span> had been&#151;and Calvert supervised the staging at Booth's Theatre in February 1875 with George Rignold in the title role.<br>
<br>Calvert's management of the Prince's was also characterized by revivals of Byron (<span class="italic">The Two Foscari</span>, <span class="italic">Manfred</span>, and <span class="italic">Sardanapalus</span>, the last also being bought by Jarrett and Palmer) and the annual pantomimes, upon which he lavished the same attention as he did on his Shakespearian revivals. Despite his own incursion into playwriting Calvert did little to encourage new plays. At the Theatre Royal he had encouraged the youthful talent of Henry Irving, and the Prince's was renowned as a nursery for aspiring actors, including Frank Archer, A. W. Pinero, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Pauline Markham, Teresa Furtado, Fanny Brough, Kate Bishop, Nelly Moore, and Rose Coghlan. Just how much individual attention these performers received from Calvert is a matter of dispute, but the experience of working with a man endowed with such idealism, integrity, and imagination stood them in good stead in their later careers.<br>
<br>Calvert departed the Prince's Theatre in 1875. He achieved one further major Shakespearian revival&#151;<span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> at the Theatre Royal, Manchester (28 September 1877)&#151;but his plans to stage <span class="italic">Henry VI</span> and <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> remained unrealized, as did his involvement in a Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and Colonel J. H. Mapleson's Grand Opera House&#151;both in London. The remaining years of Calvert's life were spent touring the provinces with his own company in a repertory which still included Shakespeare alongside other less worthy offerings. He succumbed to a terminal bout of nervous prostration in Glasgow in April 1879 and died, aged fifty-one, in Fulham on 12 June 1879. The high esteem in which Calvert was held by his profession and the public was manifested in two ways. An estimated 50,000 people lined the route of his funeral procession through the streets of Manchester to Brooklands cemetery, where the liberal-minded Congregational minister Edwin Paxton Hood presided over the service, as a result of which he incurred the disfavour of his congregation at the Alexander Street Chapel. On 1 and 2 October two memorial (benefit) performances of <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> were played at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, with a combined cast of amateurs and professionals, led on 2 October by Helen Faucit as Rosalind. Calvert left a widow, five sons, and two daughters. In his address, spoken before the performances, H. M. Acton wrote<blockquote>
<div class="indent">But none who Calvert knew<br>
</div>
<div>Will doubt his place amongst the foremost few.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>As an actor, though his physical advantages were few, Calvert had stage presence and a good voice. Above all he brought a sharp intelligence to his interpretations, especially of Shakespearian roles. As a manager &#145;his place amongst the foremost few&#146; is assured. Calvert's Shakespearian revivals were not merely stepping-stones between the eras of Phelps&#150;Kean and Irving, but they stand proud in their own right, equal to comparison with what was to come and what had gone before.<h2>
<a name="OtheractingCalverts"></a>Other acting Calverts</h2>Calvert's widow, <a name="cosubject_38746"></a><span class="headword">Adelaide Helen Calvert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1836, <em>d.</em> 1921), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Loughborough, the eldest of the four daughters of James Biddles, then a tobacconist, soon to be an actor and entertainer, and his first wife, Ann Maria. Adelaide was baptized at All Saints' Church, Loughborough, on 1 April 1836. At the age of six she was established as &#145;an infant prodigy&#146; in the stock company (that of Mr Harvey operating in Weymouth, Guernsey, and Exeter) of which her parents were members. She appeared with Henry Betty, son of the &#145;Infant Roscius&#146;, and Charles and Ellen Kean. Following the death of their mother, Adelaide and her sister Clara were sent to a boarding-school in Nottingham, but when their father took over the management of the Bower Saloon in October 1845 they rejoined him (and his second wife) and were soon appearing on stage. In a varied repertory Adelaide undertook roles in melodrama, Shakespeare, and pantomime; she also became the pupil of the celebrated clown Richard Flexmore, a neighbour in Hercules Buildings, Lambeth. In October 1851 her drama <span class="italic">Amy Lawrence: a Tale of an Old Man's Love</span> (adapted from a story serialized in the <span class="italic">London Journal of Science and Art</span>) was successfully staged at the Bower with the author in the title role.<br>
<br>In August 1853 Biddles secured engagements for both Adelaide and Clara with E. Holmes at the Theatre Royal, Southampton, where the company included Mary Seyton (Mary E. Braddon, the novelist) and Charles Calvert, Adelaide's future husband. Adelaide achieved further success with <span class="italic">Amy Lawrence</span>, wrote and appeared in <span class="italic">Minnegray the Gipsy Girl</span>, and was acclaimed as Ophelia and Juliet. The sisters were recalled in the summer of 1854 to the Bower Saloon, where their acting impressed Thomas Barry and was the major inducement for Barry to contract the whole Biddles family for the new Boston Theatre, of which he was the manager. Following a prolonged and stormy voyage, during which Adelaide exercised her literary talents, writing poetry and short stories, the Biddleses arrived in the New World in the autumn of 1854. Adelaide swiftly proved her worth, appearing with Edwin Forrest, who coached her as Calanthe in <span class="italic">Damon and Pythias</span>, and as Lady Percy to James Hackett's Falstaff in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>. Adelaide remained in Boston for the 1855&#150;6 season, adding to her laurels as Hero and Black-eyed Susan, but Calvert was still pressing his suit and she returned to England for their marriage, at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, on 31 August 1856. Adelaide joined her husband at the Surrey Theatre, where her performance as Juliet won plaudits from <span class="italic">The Times</span> (18 December 1856): &#145;a commanding yet delicate figure, a distinct but not unfeminine voice, and a profusion of raven hair &hellip; In the traditional business of the character she is thoroughly versed, and &hellip; she manifests an amount of genuine feeling that may obtain for her a position more generally recognised than that which she at present holds.&#146;<br>
<br>Adelaide's &#145;delicate figure&#146; soon swelled with the first (Leonard) of eight children (of whom seven survived) but she resolutely pursued her acting career, appearing not only with her husband, but also, in Brighton in October 1860, with Ira Aldridge (the &#145;Negro Tragedian&#146;), as Lavinia, in his singular adaptation of <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span>. By then Charles was in Manchester, and when he assumed the management of the Prince's Theatre in 1864 Adelaide supported him not only on stage, but also in the management. Family responsibilities and the perennial dearth of roles for actresses of middle years somewhat curtailed her appearances for a time, but she played Miranda, Beatrice, Cleopatra (with thrilling power in the final act), Hermione, Queen Elizabeth in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, and Chorus in <span class="italic">Henry V</span> in Calvert's revivals and was also admired as Portia (<span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>) and Queen Katharine. She repeated Chorus in the opening weeks (February 1875) of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> in New York, before which she visited her sister Clara (who had married Thomas Barry, forty years her senior) in Boston.<br>
<br>At the time of Charles Calvert's last illness in April 1879 Adelaide was appearing, as Gertrude to Barry Sullivan's Hamlet, at the opening of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford upon Avon. Once she was widowed, the pursuit of her career was a financial imperative. In October 1881 she embarked on a forty-week tour of the United States with Edwin Booth, playing Emilia, Goneril, and Gertrude; back in England&#151;in 1883&#151;she appeared with Adelaide Ristori, partnering the Italian actress as Queen Elizabeth in Schiller's <span class="italic">Mary Stuart</span>. Further visits to America followed with Mary Anderson (1885&#150;6 and 1888) and with Lillie Langtry (1886), but Adelaide's opportunities were limited to relatively minor roles.<br>
<br>Adelaide Calvert was reconciling herself to imminent retirement when very much by chance, in April 1894, came what Shaw described as the &#145;rise from utter extinction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bernard Shaw and Mrs Patrick Campbell: their Correspondence</span>, ed. A. Dent, 1952, 264) with the role of Catherine Petkoff in <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span>. This revived her career for a further fifteen years, during which she appeared, principally in the West End, in a succession of contemporary plays (by F. C. Burnand, Captain Marshall, H. A. Jones, R. C. Carton, Maugham) and classic revivals. Her Mrs Malaprop in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (March 1900), her Mrs Heidleberg in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> (March 1903)&#151;both with Cyril Maude at the Haymarket&#151;and her Mrs Hardcastle in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (first in New York and then at the Waldorf Theatre with Maude in February 1906) were hailed as definitive performances in the finest tradition of comedy character acting. Adelaide joined Beerbohm Tree's company for <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> at His Majesty's to play An Old Lady in September 1910, and in June 1911 she took her place alongside Madge Kendal and Ellen Terry in the coronation gala performance. In that year she published her memoirs, <span class="italic">Sixty-Eight Years on the Stage</span>, in which she recounted her remarkable career and reflected upon the changes, principally its &#145;gentrification&#146;, in her profession. From infant prodigy in an 1840s stock company to <i>grande dame</i> at the 1911 coronation gala, from Juliet to Mrs Malaprop, Adelaide Calvert had achieved distinction in every age of her lengthy career. She died, after forty-two years of widowhood, in Barnes on 20 September 1921.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51452"></a><span class="headword">Louis Calvert</span>  (1859&#150;1923), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the third son of Charles and Adelaide Calvert, was born in Manchester on 25 November 1859. He was educated at Dr Ernest Adams's academy in Manchester, where he showed an early inclination towards acting, and in Germany. Although Charles Calvert discouraged his children from taking up the theatre as a career, Louis, like his brothers Leonard, William, Alexander, and Cecil, followed in his parents' footsteps on to the stage. Louis made his d&eacute;but in Natal in 1878 and proceeded to Australia before returning to England in 1880. During the following decade he gained varied experience with Sarah Thorne at Margate, with Henry Irving at the Lyceum, and with Lillie Langtry in America.<br>
<br>By the mid-1890s Calvert was concentrating on Shakespeare and earning a reputation as both an actor and a producer. He was a finely articulated Mark Antony in Frank Benson's <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>. For the Manchester committee of the Independent Theatre he staged an Elizabethan-style production of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (February 1895), to which his work for Richard Flanagan at the Queen's Theatre in the same city (<span class="italic">Henry IV Part 1</span>, February 1896; <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, February 1897) was&#151;in its Saxe-Meiningen style of archaeological naturalism&#151;a marked contrast. It was this style of production which commended Calvert to Beerbohm Tree initially as co-producer of <span class="italic">Henry IV Part 1</span> at the Haymarket (May 1896) and in the same capacity with <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> at Her Majesty's in January 1898. Calvert's performances as Casca, Cardinal Pandulf (<span class="italic">King John</span>, September 1899), Flute (January 1900), and Dogberry were noted for his ability to deliver dialogue with freshness and clarity. Of Calvert's Dogberry Shaw wrote: &#145;To Mr Calvert it [the dialogue] is as natural as his native speech; he makes it clear, expressive and vivid without the least preoccupation&#146;  (&#145;The dying tongue of Great Elizabeth&#146;, <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 11 Feb 1905).<br>
<br>By 1905 Calvert had already created the role of Broadbent in Shaw's <span class="italic">John Bull's other Island</span> under the Vedrenne&#150;Barker management at the Court Theatre (November 1904). A hard taskmaster, Shaw recognized Calvert's ability to give just the right emphasis and accentuation down to the minutest inflection. In May 1905 Calvert played the Waiter in <span class="italic">You Never can Tell</span>, but it was his creation of the role of Andrew Undershaft in <span class="italic">Major Barbara</span> (Court Theatre, 28 November 1905) that posed the greatest challenge to the partnership between author and actor. Shaw likened the role to playing a trombone; Calvert certainly had the volume, and under Shaw's tutelage he gradually mastered the structure of the long speeches and their infinite nuances. In his manual <span class="italic">Problems of the Actor</span> (1919), Calvert acknowledged his debt to Shaw and upheld the virtues of traditional&#151;by then often damned as declamatory&#151;elocution which, he maintained, was not incompatible with the appearance of naturalism.<br>
<br>With numerous relatives in the United States (seventy-two in Chicago alone), Calvert was a regular visitor. In 1909 he was engaged as stage-manager of the recently constructed New Theatre in New York, an ambitious venture modelled on the state theatres of Europe, but without their subsidies. Calvert's brief was to supervise, and appear in, productions of plays from the English repertory, particularly Shakespeare. The task was a difficult one with mixed casts of English and American actors, the latter with little experience of classical acting. The opening production of <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (in November 1909) foundered under monumental sets and the egos of E. H. Sothern and Julia Marlowe in the title roles; <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (January 1910) was lacklustre, but with <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (March 1910) Calvert combined ensemble acting with an Elizabethan-style setting in a production which prefigured Granville Barker's at the Savoy Theatre, London, in 1912. The repertory seasons at the New Theatre survived for less than two years, but Calvert spent most of the remainder of his life in America, establishing himself as a respected teacher of acting in several universities and academies. Calvert was twice married, first to Rose Roberts, an actress, and secondly to Violet Fenton, also an actress, with whom he had two daughters, Ray (Beatrice) and Patricia. He died at his home, 321, West 55th Street, New York, on 18 July 1923. James Agate's verdict was &#145;Calvert was not only a fine actor, but the cause whereby fine acting is in others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 22 July 1923).<br>
