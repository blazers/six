<span class="headword">Seton,  Alexander</span>, first Viscount Kingston  (1621&#150;1691), <span class="occ">nobleman and soldier</span>, was born at Seton Palace, Haddingtonshire, the fourth but second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25122/', "George Seton, third earl of Winton (1584&#150;1650)")</script>, and his first wife, Lady Anne Hay (<i>d</i>. 1623&times;5), eldest daughter of Francis Hay, ninth earl of Erroll. On the visit of Charles I to Seton Palace in 1633, as a boy of twelve, he welcomed the king at the iron gate of Seton with a Latin oration and was knighted on the completion of his discourse. In 1636 he commenced a two-year period of study at the Jesuit college of La Fl&egrave;che in France where he successfully defended his thesis and had it printed on satin and sent home to his father, to whom it was dedicated. Afterwards he made a tour through a great part of Italy, Spain, and France. He returned via England to Scotland in 1640, carrying with him letters of encouragement from Charles I to Catholic loyalists such as George Gordon, second marquess of Huntly, Robert Maxwell, first earl of Nithsdale, and his own father, the earl of Winton; he himself probably continued to embrace Catholicism. To avoid subscribing the solemn league and covenant, he went in 1643 to the Netherlands and on returning to Scotland some eight months later was excommunicated in Tranent church on 8 October 1644.<br>
<br>Shortly thereafter Seton crossed to France, where he remained in attendance on the young Prince Charles for three years. Late in 1647 he returned to England and carried messages back from the king to his wife, Henrietta Maria, and to the prince. According to his continuation of Sir Richard Maitland's history of his family, published as <span class="italic">History of the House of Seton</span> (1829), Seton carried word of the engagement to the queen at St Germain, telling her that a large Scottish army would invade England in the summer of 1648 and restore the king to his dignity. In August of that year he was a lieutenant-colonel of horse in the army of the engagement that was defeated by Oliver Cromwell at Preston.<br>
<br>Three days after the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651, Seton was created, by patent dated at Perth, Viscount Kingston and Lord Craigiehall, possibly the new king's first creation. By this time he had married Jean, daughter of Sir Andrew Fletcher, who had been a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I; their eldest child, Jean (or Anne), was born in April 1651, and there followed Charles (1653&#150;1682), George (1654&#150;1678), Alexander (1655&#150;1676), and Isobel (1656&#150;1677). Viscountess Jean died in the later 1650s. Barbara (1659&#150;1679) may have been the daughter of Kingston's second wife, Elizabeth (1635/6&#150;1668), daughter of Sir Archibald Douglas of Whittingehame, Haddingtonshire; they had three other children, Archibald (1661&#150;1714), James (1667&#150;1743), and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1668), before Viscountess Elizabeth also died.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Kingston held various military positions and commanded the militia troop of Haddingtonshire at the defeat of the covenanters on the Pentland Hills on 28 November 1666. He also served at his own expense under the duke of Monmouth, and played a part in the victory over the covenanters at Bothwell Bridge on 22 June 1679. On 28 July 1681 Kingston was one of the signatories to a declaration stating that it was unlawful under all circumstances to take up arms against the king, and that the national covenant and the solemn league and covenant were against the &#145;fundamental laws and liberties&#146; of the kingdom  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 7.705).<br>
<br>Kingston married again, first Elizabeth, daughter of John Hamilton, first Lord Belhaven, and then, on 3 August 1686, Lady Margaret (1651&#150;1692), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7869/', "Archibald Douglas, styled earl of Angus (c.1609&#150;1655)")</script>, and sister of James Douglas, second marquess of Douglas, and Archibald Douglas, first earl of Forfar. There were no children from either marriage. Kingston died on 21 October 1691 and was buried in the family vault at Seton Palace. Most of his children having predeceased him, his sons Archibald and James became successively second and third Viscount Kingston. The latter was attainted in the aftermath of the 1715 Jacobite rising, and the title became extinct.<br>
