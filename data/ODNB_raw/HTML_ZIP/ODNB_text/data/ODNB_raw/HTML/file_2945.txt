<span class="headword">Bosville,  William</span>  (1745&#150;1813), <span class="occ">society host and radical</span>, was born on 21 July 1745, the eldest son of Godfrey Bosville of Gunthwaite, Yorkshire, and his wife, Diana, the eldest daughter of Sir William Wentworth, baronet, of West Bretton. Bosville was able to trace his family back to the reign of William I and proved to be the last male descendant of Richard Bosville, who had inherited Gunthwaite during the reign of Henry VI. He was educated at Harrow School, and received a commission in the Coldstream Guards on 24 December 1761. He rose to the rank of lieutenant in January 1769, and served with the regiment during the early stages of the American War of Independence. On retirement from the army in June 1777 he returned to England with a son of Edward, Baron Hawke, via France, Italy, and Morocco.<br>
<br>Back in London, Bosville established a reputation as a generous, if somewhat inflexible, host at his house on Welbeck Street. On each weekday he received no more than twelve guests to dine with him at 5 p.m. precisely. Visitors who missed the appointment by even a couple of minutes were refused entry, a measure Bosville justified with a favoured maxim: &#145;Some say better late than never; I say better never than late&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Sinclair, 2.183). Among his regular guests, who were expected to sign their name on a slate kept in the hall, were Sir Francis Burdett, the Revd Charles Este, lords Oxford and Hutchinson, and the radical and philologist John Horne Tooke. Tooke repaid Bosville's generosity by including him as one of the circle who visited his Wimbledon house, Chester Lodge, to dine on Sundays during spring and summer.<br>
<br>Politically Bosville was a committed supporter of Tooke, assisting his campaign for the Westminster election in 1796 and acting, unsuccessfully, as an intermediary between Tooke and Charles James Fox. An original member of the Friends of the People (formed in April 1792), Bosville was adjudged soon after his death to have been &#145;one of the most ultra-liberal spirits of the time&#146;  (Sinclair, 2.183). With others from his dining circle, he contributed to Tooke's dwindling finances during the late 1790s as well as donating &pound;1000 to William Cobbett, whom he visited during his imprisonment in Newgate between 1810 and 1812.<br>
<br>Sartorially Bosville proved rather more conservative, indeed eccentric, dressing only in the outmoded powdered wig and frock coat of a mid-eighteenth-century courtier. His clear preference for metropolitan life meant that he made few journeys to his considerable estates in the north of England, notably that of Thorp Hall near Bridlington, which he refused to visit lest he become involved in the responsibilities of landowning. His stories of travelling&#151;to the Isles of Scilly and to Rome during the final days of Clement XIV&#151;were fictions to entertain guests at Welbeck Street. In his will the unmarried Bosville left the majority of his property, including Thorp Hall, to his nephew Godfrey Macdonald, later third Baron Macdonald. He also left &#145;a large sum of ready money&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 64, 1813, 553) and, in addition to landed estates, bequeathed &pound;19,000 to friends including Charles Este.<br>
<br>Though in increasingly poor health, Bosville continued to hold daily dinner parties at Welbeck Street until 16 December 1813, when, with his guests due at 5 p.m., he died earlier in the day. He was buried eight days later in the chancel of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London.<br>
