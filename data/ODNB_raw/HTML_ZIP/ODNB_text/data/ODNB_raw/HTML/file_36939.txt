<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wills, Sir  George Alfred</span>, first baronet  (1854&#150;1928), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer and benefactor</span>, was born at Rusholme Villas, Victoria Road, Kingsdown, Bristol, on 3 June 1854, the eldest son of Henry Overton Wills (1828&#150;1911), tobacco manufacturer, of Kelston Knoll, near Bath, and his wife, Alice Hopkinson, of Manchester. He was educated first at Dr Hudson's private school, Manilla Hall, Clifton, where he was contemporary with (Thomas) Herbert Warren (afterwards president of Magdalen College, Oxford), with whom he retained a lifelong friendship. From about 1868 to 1872 he was at Mill Hill School, London, where he developed an interest in history which was maintained throughout his life. It was not customary at that time to send to university boys who were intended for a business career. Wills always regretted his lack of a university education, a subject in which in later life he took the keenest interest.<br>
<br>In October 1874, at the age of twenty, Wills entered the Bristol tobacco firm of W. D. and H. O. Wills. This firm had had a continuous history from the early eighteenth century. Wills's father, Henry Overton Wills, had retired from the business and took no further part in the management. Wills quickly proved his capacity. He was trained in every department of the business, and became factory manager in 1875, aged only twenty-one. Together with his brother Henry Herbert (Harry) Wills, George gradually took a dominant role in the day-to-day management of the firm. He became a partner in June 1882, followed by his brother Harry two years later. It was Harry, in charge of the technical aspects of the business, who first came across the Bonsack cigarette-making machine, but it was George who successfully negotiated for Wills to have exclusive patent rights to the machine in Britain for only &pound;4000. This has been described as &#145;one of the best buys in industrial history&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>).<br>
<br>It was not until 1888 that George and Harry were able to persuade the more conservative members of the family to introduce cheap, machine-made cigarettes. However, the first Woodbines, selling for 1<i>d</i>. for five, proved phenomenally successful. &#145;That moment marks the beginning of Wills's transformation from a prosperous manufacturing company into an enormously rich enterprise of international standing. And the Wills family became one of the richest in the land&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>).<br>
<br>Wills had enormous drive, as well as a real knack for business. He mastered the intricacies of producing tobacco, and proved to be an expert buyer of the leaf. In 1886 George and Harry persuaded their uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36940/', "William Henry Wills")</script> of the need to move production to a new purpose-built factory at Bedminster, near Bristol, and in 1888 George became its manager.<br>
<br>In the early years of the twentieth century the tobacco trade in Great Britain was seriously threatened by a trial of strength between the American Tobacco Company and a combination of British manufacturers. George Wills and his second cousin William Henry Wills (later Baron Winterstoke) were together responsible for conducting the intricate and difficult negotiations which resulted in the foundation of the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland in 1901. The Wills family controlled 60 per cent of the new company, and in 1902 an agreement was reached to end the tobacco war, with the American company agreeing to withdraw from the UK market. George played a leading role in the negotiations. He was an original director of Imperial. On Lord Winterstoke's death in 1911 Wills became chairman of the company, and he remained actively in business until 1924, when he retired on account of failing health; he continued, however, to act in an advisory capacity, with the title of president of the company, until his death.<br>
<br>Wills took no part in politics, and never stood for municipal office, though he was sheriff of Bristol from 1899 to 1900, but throughout his life he took a keen interest in Bristol charitable institutions, particularly the General Hospital. After long association with it he became president of the hospital in 1913. He not merely contributed munificently to its development and maintenance, but was active and constant in its administration and a regular visitor to the wards. He was a generous supporter of other hospitals and institutions. In 1909 he purchased the Leigh Woods on the banks of the Avon and presented them to the National Trust to preserve them for the public.<br>
<br>Wills's greatest public work was in the cause of the University of Bristol, of which his father was the founder and first chancellor. The University College of Bristol had been opened in 1876. In the early years of the twentieth century a movement was set on foot to erect the college into a university, but little progress was made with the scheme in spite of the labours of an energetic committee under the chairmanship of Lewis Fry. In 1908 Wills was president, for the year, of the Colston Society, a local body for the encouragement of research, and at the annual dinner of the society in that year he announced the gift of &pound;100,000 from his father towards the establishing of a university in Bristol. Wills himself purchased the Coombe Dingle estate, and equipped it as playing fields for the university. A charter for the university was granted in 1909. Four years later, in February 1913, Wills wrote to Lewis Fry, chairman of the council, stating simply that he and his brother Henry Herbert Wills considered the time to be due for extending the university and ensuring to it a building worthy of the city; accordingly, they offered the sum of &pound;150,000. The onset of the First World War, and the enormous increase in costs, slowed progress, but Wills, who always saw through to completion every project he initiated, gave continued support, notwithstanding that the total expenditure on the new building&#151;great hall, reception and lecture rooms, tower, and offices&#151;amounted to &pound;600,000. Wills always made it a rule to give funds for maintenance as well as for construction, and thus the university was relieved of very considerable charges in the future. He purchased the Victoria Rooms, Clifton, and equipped them as a university union, with a fund for maintenance. His final gift was to purchase an estate on the downs, at Stoke Bishop, and to build and endow a magnificent hall of residence for men. This was completed in 1929, the year after his death.<br>
<br>Besides his princely generosity to the University of Bristol, Wills devoted much time and energy to its affairs. He was a governor of the old University College, and treasurer of the university from its foundation in 1909 until 1918. He became a pro-chancellor in 1911, and in 1913 he succeeded Lewis Fry in the onerous position of chairman of the council.<br>
<br>A man of retiring but lovable nature, George Wills exercised a wide personal influence. Sympathetic, and with a keen sense of humour, he was always approachable. He had strong nonconformist beliefs, and his outlook was marked by a high degree of sobriety, including opposition to all forms of speculation or gambling. He was favourable to his workmen joining a trade union, although he felt that no union could offer them benefits equal to those which they already enjoyed in his works. He was personally well known to very large numbers of the workers in the tobacco factory and was on the best possible terms with them; it was a source of satisfaction to him that there was never a strike in the factory in his time.<br>
<br>On 12 September 1878 Wills married Susan Britton, daughter of Robert Proctor, of Clifton; they had one son and four daughters. Wills lived chiefly at Burwalls, Leigh Woods, outside Clifton, and at Blagdon, Somerset, but he usually went with his family for three or four weeks each year to Scotland, or to a farm which he owned at Aale, in Ramsdelen, Norway. Fishing and walking were his chief recreations. He was also keenly interested in music and was an accomplished organist.<br>
<br>George Wills was created a baronet in 1923, and received the honorary degree of DCL from the University of Oxford in 1926: as he was unable to travel, the vice-chancellor visited Bristol and conferred the degree on him in his own house. He died at Burwalls on 11 July 1928, and was succeeded as second baronet by his son, George Vernon Proctor (<i>b</i>. 1887). The near monopoly enjoyed by Wills in the UK cigarette market brought enormous rewards, and after his death Sir George's estate was valued at &pound;10 million.<br>
