<span class="headword">Acton,  Henry</span>  (1797&#150;1843), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born on 10 March 1797, at Lewes, Sussex, the third of four sons of William Acton, a labourer, and his wife, Mary. Apprenticed at sixteen to a printer, Acton was led by biblical study from Anglicanism to Unitarianism and to the General Baptist chapel in Eastport Lane, Southover. So evident was his promise in a small discussion group there, as well as in a similar group of fellow working men, that when his apprenticeship was ended by agreement in 1818, members of Westgate Chapel, the Unitarian congregation in Lewes, offered to subsidize his attendance at the school in Hove kept by Dr John Morell (1775&#150;1840), the Unitarian minister at Brighton.<br>
<br>Earlier the same year, with William Browne, a fellow apprentice, Acton had begun to supply the pulpit at the Old Meeting-House in nearby Ditchling, alternating services there with Eastport Lane. When his schooling ended in 1821, he became minister at Walthamstow and two years later was made co-pastor with James Manning (1754&#150;1831) at George's Meeting, Exeter. There, for a time, he was second master at a school at Mount Radford. In 1833&#150;7, with a member of his congregation, the physician and classicist Thomas Foster Barham (1794&#150;1869), he conducted a periodical, the <span class="italic">Gospel Advocate</span>. Shortly after his settlement he married Mary Curtis (<i>d</i>. 1868); they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>On Manning's death in 1831 Acton wanted to be made sole pastor, but the congregation, despite its declining state, chose to appoint a second minister, probably reflecting Acton's disinclination to pastoral work. Strangers sometimes found him haughty, and his talent at raillery gave some offence, but his extraordinary skill at extempore preaching&#151;a formidable memory made even prepared sermons seem spontaneous&#151;was greatly appreciated. His lectures in 1835 defending Unitarianism against an Anglican challenger, Dr Daniel Bagot, led a grateful congregation to vote him &pound;100; a year earlier he had taken on Henry Phillpotts (1778&#150;1869), bishop of Exeter, and in a series of lectures in 1840 attacked the then much-canvassed doctrine of apostolic succession. His published works are listed in the volume of selected sermons that appeared in 1846.<br>
<br>Acton was also active in civil rights and liberal causes; his last appearance at a public meeting was to protest the education clauses of Sir James Graham's factory bill of 1843. He died of apoplexy at Exeter, on 22 August 1843; an appeal to assist his widow and children brought wide support.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_65464"></a><span class="headword">Roger Curtis Acton</span>  (1827&#150;1906)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son and second child of the above, was born in Exeter and trained there as a journalist under Thomas Latimer, the crusading editor of the radical <span class="italic">Western Times</span>. He later joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. Loyal to his inherited liberalism, in 1860 Acton published (and dedicated to Lord John Russell) a translation of a work by Conte Terenzio Mamiani della Rovere, entitled <span class="italic">Rights of Nations, or, The New Law of European States</span>, which set out a clear doctrine of national sovereignty. Acton's contributions to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> cannot be traced, but his general area of responsibility is suggested by subsequent publications. In 1869 he provided the narrative history for an account, separately published by the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, of the British Abyssinian expedition of 1868 and the life and reign of King Theodore which it ended. An early member of the Royal Colonial Institute (later the Royal Empire Society), he published a descriptive sketch of British possessions in <span class="italic">Our Colonial Empire</span> (1881), and in 1899 produced <span class="italic">The Transvaal Boer Speaking for Himself</span>, an abridged translation of a history of the southern African republic by C. N. J. du Plessis (1836&#150;1928). Acton died in Hale, Cheshire, on 2 March 1906 of broncho-pneumonia and heart failure.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49449"></a><span class="headword">Henry Morell Acton</span>  (1828&#150;1907), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Exeter in 1827, third child and second son of Henry Acton. From the Presbyterian college, Carmarthen, he entered Manchester New College in 1845, but uncertainty about the ministry led him to resign in 1848. He was recruited by Jeremiah Garnett (1793&#150;1870) to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, where he became a leader writer. His &#145;tact and delicacy&#146; were called upon notably in 1871 to make amends when the new editor, C. P. Scott (1846&#150;1932), incautiously appealed to wealthy Mancunians to support physical science at Oxford just as Owens College, in Manchester, was struggling into existence. On 29 July 1863 Acton married Anne Shaw Williamson, daughter of Nathaniel Williamson, sharebroker, of Whalley Range, Lancashire; they had a daughter and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30328/', "Edward Acton")</script>, who achieved prominence as a judge.<br>
<br>In 1844 Acton was forced into retirement, with a handsome (and unusual) pension, to make way for William Thomas Arnold, whom Scott thought essential to his own future political career. The newspaper's historian sees Acton's departure as marking the end of an era, as whiggism was abandoned for Gladstonian Liberalism  (Ayerst, 237&#150;8), but it also signals a shift from an earlier reliance on a notably Unitarian provincial culture to recruiting from the older universities. Acton was deeply involved in Manchester literary and theatrical life. Suffering from &#145;senile decay&#146;, he died on 21 February 1907 at Glendale, Ashley Road, Hale, Cheshire.<br>
