<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heath,  Neville George Clevely</span>  (1917&#150;1946), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born on 6 June 1917 at 15 Dudley Road, Ilford, Essex, the elder son of William George Heath, a soft goods traveller, and his wife, Bessie Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clevely. His father claimed descent from James Heath the engraver. After leaving Rutlish, a local authority grammar school in Merton, south London, at the age of seventeen, Heath worked as a packer in a City warehouse before enlisting in the Artists' Rifles in 1935. He received a short service commission in the RAF in 1936, but was court-martialled and dismissed the following year. The charges against him included embezzlement, being absent without leave, and borrowing a car without its owner's permission.<br>
<br>Heath was a bright, personable young man with charm and ability. Tall, broad, spruce, and fresh complexioned, with blue eyes and fair, wavy hair, he attracted many women. He used his gifts to woo a succession of middle-class young women with the intention of extracting money from their families. He was an incorrigible liar, braggart, cheat, and impostor. Although it is impossible to trace all his misdeeds some episodes reached the public domain. In November 1937 he was put on probation for two years after being convicted of fraudulently obtaining credit at a Nottingham hotel and of attempting to obtain a car by false pretences. Eight other offences were taken into consideration, including impersonation of the thirteenth Baron Dudley. In July 1938 he was sentenced to three years' borstal treatment after convictions for housebreaking, forging a banker's order, and stealing jewellery. He was released from the borstal at Hollesley Bay in Suffolk immediately after the outbreak of war, and was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps in March 1940. While serving in the Middle East he spent lavishly in the clubs and brothels of Cairo, where he liked to flagellate young women. In July 1941 he was court-martialled for being absent without leave, issuing dishonoured cheques, and fraudulently obtaining a second pay book. He absconded from a troopship returning him to England, and under the name of Armstrong enlisted in the South African Air Force, where he undertook transport and instructional duties. His operational duties amounted to one flight in October 1944 while seconded to the RAF. He stood his third court martial in South Africa in December 1945 on charges that included wearing decorations without authority. Wimbledon magistrates convicted him on a similar charge in February 1946.<br>
<br>In February 1942 in South Africa, Heath married Elizabeth Hardcastle Pitt-Rivers of Johannesburg, but she divorced him in October 1945. They had one son. His sexual aggression and dissolute habits were becoming more pronounced. After being deported from South Africa he returned to London. In February 1946 he took a married woman to a bedroom of the Strand Palace Hotel, where he had registered under his favourite alias, Captain James Cadogan Armstrong. He stunned and tied her, and was caning her when the hotel manager broke in. Neither the hotel nor the woman desired publicity. On the night of 20&#150;21 June 1946, after a day of heavy drinking, he took Mrs Margery Aim&eacute;e Brownell Gardner (<i>b</i>. 1915) to his room at the Pembridge Court Hotel at Notting Hill Gate. She was a masochist who had consented to sado-masochistic rites but (perhaps inflamed by drink) he lost control. After gagging her, he lashed her with a riding crop and subjected her to cruel and disgusting violence both externally and internally. During the attack she was suffocated. Afterwards he went to Worthing to meet his fianc&eacute;e, Yvonne Symonds, to whom he spoke about the murder with a detailed accuracy that could not have been gleaned from newspapers. He also sent an ill-advised letter about the murder to the investigating officer at Scotland Yard, who initiated a nationwide search so that he could be questioned. On 23 June he arrived at Tollard Royal Hotel in Bournemouth staying under the name of Group Captain Rupert Brooke. In Bournemouth on 3 July he met a young convalescent rating in the Women's Royal Naval Service, Doreen Marshall, and, after getting drunk, cut her throat, leaving her naked body in Branksome Chine. Again he subjected her body to the most intrusive and repellent mutilations. Although her body was not found until 8 July, he was detained on 6 July by police investigating her disappearance, a detective constable having noticed the resemblance between Group Captain Brooke and Heath, whom Scotland Yard wanted for questioning in the Gardner murder. Evidence quickly accumulated tying him to both crimes.<br>
<br>Heath went for trial for the Gardner murder at the Old Bailey on 24 September 1946 before Sir John Morris (the Marshall murder charge was held back). Heath expressed no contrition, but made little effort to escape the gallows. His counsel, Joshua Casswell, was fascinated and charmed by him. The committal proceedings aroused a great sensation, while the trial was notable for its discussion by expert witnesses of the nature of sadism as a sexual perversion, and of the question of criminal responsibility in such a murder. This was the first time in British criminal justice that sadism was examined in such scrupulous detail in a murder trial. The jury on 26 September took under an hour to find him guilty; there was no appeal. Accordingly he was executed by Albert Pierrepoint on 26 October 1946 at Pentonville prison, and was buried a few hours later in quicklime by the prison wall.<br>
