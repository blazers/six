<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hibberd,  (James) Shirley</span>  (1825&#150;1890), <span class="occ">journalist and writer on horticulture</span>, was born in the parish of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, the son of a retired sea captain who had served under Nelson. He attended the Old Meeting House School, Stepney but, following the early death of his father (who had connections with the printing trade), he gave up his intention to have a career in medicine, and was apprenticed to a Stepney bookseller, though he retained his scientific interests and gave lectures on chemistry. He was also a speaker and writer advocating temperance and vegetarianism. In 1850, after several years of bookselling, he married Sarah Elizabeth Voyer (1823/4&#150;1880), an author and compiler, the daughter of a bookseller and gold engraver. They moved to Pentonville, and turned to horticultural journalism, in which he soon became a leader of middle-class fashionable taste. His earliest essays were on brambles, quickly followed by a practical gardening book, <span class="italic">The Town Garden: a Manual for the Management of City and Suburban Gardens</span> (1855). Sensing a market among the advice books and gardening manuals of the era, Hibberd followed up with the very successful <span class="italic">Rustic Adornments</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">Garden Favourites</span> (1858). In 1858 he became the first editor of the newly established magazine <span class="italic">Floral World</span>, which he managed until 1875 with considerable success. From then onwards he turned his energies towards writing popular gardening manuals, making horticultural experiments, and creating a succession of specialist gardens in various parts of north London. In Stoke Newington he created one garden for fruit, another for vegetables, another for roses, and so on. Eventually lack of space encouraged him to move to 74 The Hermitage, a private road in Muswell Hill. By the time of his death this too was filled with his gardens.<br>
<br>Hibberd reported the results of his experiments in a series of fluent and engagingly personal books which contributed greatly to the new, highly decorative, ornamental fashion in gardens. He wrote with the experience of trial and error. His <span class="italic">Profitable Gardening</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Rose Book</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">Fern Garden</span> (1869) were particularly successful. Among other things, Hibberd grew shrubs and trees in pots, built up a collection of specimen hollies and ivies, gave a number of popular lectures, and wrote on greenhouse design, interior flower arrangements, water gardens, seats, arbours, Wardian cases, and ferneries. As a social historian of internal and exterior furnishings his work is almost unchallenged. From 1861 he was also connected with the <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span>, becoming editor towards the end of his life. He was an active member of the Royal Horticultural Society, often exhibiting specimen plants from his own collection and judging others, and also wrote on seaweeds and aquarium plants. In the 1880s, his fame as a practical plantsman was sufficient for him to be consulted by the government about potatoes and the potato blight.<br>
<br>Hibberd wrote <span class="italic">An Epitome of the War</span> (1856), an account of the Crimean War, before concentrating on botanical writing. His wife suffered long periods of ill health, and there were no children of the marriage. Following her death, he married in 1884 his cook, Ellen Mantle (1855/6&#150;1885), who was over thirty years his junior, but she died within days of the birth of their daughter. Hibberd died at 1 Priory Road, Kew, on 16 November 1890 and was buried six days later in Abney Park cemetery at Stoke Newington. The <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> printed an obituary with a portrait, regretting that he was &#145;a victim to his own zeal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, 22 Nov 1890, 596).<br>
