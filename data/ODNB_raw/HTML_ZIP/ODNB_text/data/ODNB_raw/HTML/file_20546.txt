<span class="headword">O'Doherty, Sir  Cahir</span> <span class="st"> [Cathaoir &Oacute; Dochartaigh]</span>  (1587&#150;1608), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was born in Aileach Mor on the Inishowen peninsula, co. Donegal, the eldest legitimate son of Sir John (Se&aacute;n &Oacute;g) O'Doherty (<i>d</i>. 1601), lord of Inishowen. Although Sir John had striven to assure the English authorities of his loyalty, he fled from his territory with his family and possessions in 1600 to the lands of Hugh Roe O'Donnell (Aodh Rua &Oacute; Domhnaill) and died on 27 January 1601, a traitor in the eyes of the authorities. But in accordance with native Irish law, the inheritance of his title and estates fell to Felim Oge O'Doherty, Cahir's uncle, who was inaugurated by Hugh O'Donnell in order to ensure that Inishowen remained under his control. The exclusion of Cahir from the lordship on account of his youth gave offence to Aodh Buidhe McDavitt and Felim Riabhach MacDavitt (Mac D&aacute;ibh&eacute;id), who belonged to a sept of the O'Dohertys, and with whom Cahir had been fostered from childhood. Aodh Buidhe promised to Lord Deputy Mountjoy to submit himself to Queen Elizabeth and renounce allegiance to Hugh O'Neill and O'Donnell if Cahir's right to succession were acknowledged. After some persuasion by the MacDavitts, Cahir was confirmed as successor by the lord deputy and privy council in Ireland to ensure peace and stability in an area of strategic importance. He was removed from O'Donnell's territory, and returned with his family and possessions to Inishowen, where he was taken under the tutelage of Sir Henry Dowcra in Derry, who styled him the &Oacute; Dochartaigh and educated him as an English gentleman. Dowcra even suggested in a letter written in September 1601 to the privy council that Cahir be taken to England and educated there, but it was not acted upon.<br>
<br>Cahir O'Doherty became a fine soldier, and was knighted for bravery by Mountjoy at Augher, near Clogher, in co. Tyrone in 1602. In the following year he visited the court of James I in London, where he claimed his father's title and lands, which were in due course restored to him. On his return to Ireland, in 1604 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1609), daughter of Christopher Preston, fourth Viscount Gormanstown, was made a JP, and became an alderman of the city of Derry. When he came of age in 1605, he was established as lord of Inishowen. He stood out from his fellow clansmen by virtue of his great stature, red hair, and English dress.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1606 Dowcra retired from the governorship of Derry because of a disagreement with Lord Deputy Chichester and gave it to George Paulet, who was generally unpopular and disliked. The loss of the support of Dowcra curtailed O'Doherty's power. Early in November 1607 O'Doherty went on certain manoeuvres which aroused Paulet's suspicions and he reported to the lord deputy that O'Doherty was preparing a revolt. O'Doherty denied this and signed a document to that effect in the presence of two sureties before the lord deputy in Dublin Castle on 2 December 1607. This document, with his signature, survives.<br>
<br>In 1608 O'Doherty was appointed to a commission to rule the territory of co. Tyrone, and acted as foreman of the jury that indicted the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell, O'Neill and O'Donnell, of treason after their flight from Ireland in 1607 with their families and followers. This led to the confiscation of their lands and became known as the &#145;flight of the earls&#146;. Although O'Doherty did not follow them in flight, in the hope of something better arising from the new situation, he was ultimately driven into open rebellion. In April 1608 he was charged with treason, stripped of his lordship, and verbally and physically abused by Paulet, &#145;so that he would rather have suffered death than live to brook such insult and dishonor, or defer or delay to take revenge for it&#146;  (O'Donovan, s.a. 1608). He planned to take the fort of Culmore, which he succeeded in capturing through the unwilling assistance of the wife of Captain Harte, constable of the fort, whom he had imprisoned after inviting the couple to dine at his residence at Inishowen. He and Felim Riabhach later marched on Derry, which was sacked and burnt&#151;an attack in which Paulet was one of the first victims. The garrison was put to the sword, but the unarmed men were spared. Following this O'Doherty attacked Lifford, but was tracked down and killed by a shot in the head from the English forces under Sir Francis Rushe at Kilmacrenan in co. Donegal on 5 July 1608. His body was quartered and his head removed and sent to Dublin, and stuck on a spike above the main gate for public exhibition. Felim Riabhach was later tried for treason at Derry, convicted, and executed. Niall Garbh O'Donnell, who had ambitions of becoming the new earl of Tyrone and who had at least tacitly sided with O'Doherty, was arrested and accused of taking part in the insurrection, and sent to the Tower, where he remained for the rest of his life. O'Doherty's widow was held under arrest in Dublin but was later released and in 1609 given a pension of &pound;40 per annum out of the rents of Inishowen by Chichester. Cahir O'Doherty had an only daughter from his marriage and his younger brothers, John (Eoghan) and Rory (Ruairi), were still in fosterage at the time of his rebellion. Rory joined the &#145;wild geese&#146; and died in service in Belgium; John married Eliza, daughter of Patrick O'Cahan of Derry, and died in 1638.<br>
<br>The revolt had lasted only eleven weeks, but its results for Cahir O'Doherty's allies were catastrophic: the MacDavitts were rendered powerless and the entire barony of Inishowen was confiscated and later granted to Chichester in May 1609. The flight of the earls and the suppression of O'Doherty's brief rebellion paved the way for the plantation of Ulster between 1609 and 1613, which had certainly been the chief objective of James I's government in Ireland. Ironically, O'Doherty had at the end sought a place at court in an attempt to exert some influence over the colonial government in Dublin, and an order was received for his restoration to his former lordship on the day that his rebellion broke out.<br>
