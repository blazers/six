<span class="headword">Thomas,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Islwyn]</span>  (1832&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was born on 3 April 1832 at T&#375;'r Agent, near Ynys-ddu, in the parish of Mynyddislwyn, Monmouthshire, the ninth child and youngest son of Morgan Thomas (1776&#150;1857) and his wife, Mary (1789&#150;1866). His home language was English, and he enjoyed a comfortable upbringing. His father intended that he should become a surveyor, sending him to private schools and, finally, to Dr Evan Davies's College in Swansea. But he was accepted as a preacher in August 1854, and ordained as a Calvinistic Methodist minister in 1859 (he never accepted a pastorate) after experiencing a religious conversion under the ministry of his brother-in-law, Daniel Jenkyns. It was Jenkyns who first recognized his promise and introduced him to local poets and bardic teachers, particularly Gwilym Ilid 
    (William Jones; <i>fl</i>. 1835&#150;1853)
   and Aneurin Fardd 
    (Aneurin Jones; 1822&#150;1904)
  . Thomas adopted his bardic name in the early 1850s, taking it from Mynyddislwyn (Islwyn's Mountain) near his birthplace. Before long Islwyn was well known in the literary life of Gwent, writing in both strict and free metres and competing, with some success, in local eisteddfodau. During his time in Swansea he became engaged to Anne Bowen. In October 1853 she collapsed and died, aged twenty, a traumatic experience for the young man which left him with a lifelong psychological scar, although in 1864 he married Martha Davies, the daughter of Anne Bowen's mother's second marriage. Soon after the death of Anne, Islwyn began his major work, a long epic of the soul, &#145;Y storm&#146; (&#145;The Storm&#146;), written in two parts. The first, a poem of over 6500 lines in blank verse and other metres, was composed between December 1854 and February 1856. In May 1856 he began a second version, finishing in July of that year. Extracts from both parts appeared subsequently in periodicals and in his <span class="italic">Caniadau</span> (1867), but the poem was not published in its entirety during Islwyn's lifetime. In 1897 a confused text was included in <span class="italic">Gwaith barddonol Islwyn</span>, edited by Owen M. Edwards. Both parts received more expert editorial treatment from Meurig Walters in 1980 and 1990.<br>
<br>Modern critics, concentrating on one or other of Islwyn's versions, have attempted to elucidate a putative plan for his poem. It is, perhaps, safest to say that &#145;The Storm&#146; is a discursive, comprehensive meditation, asserting eternal providence and justifying the ways of God to men. The death of Anne Bowen may well have been the initial trigger, but the poem soon broadens its boundaries in ways no Welsh poet had attempted, using the storm image imaginatively to pursue Milton's basic theme. Here and there the Miltonic pattern of paradise lost and regained saves the work from falling apart: a world without spiritual and physical storms (paradise and memories of Eden); the storm (and its metaphorical implications); the restoration of a stormless world (through divine grace and resurrection). &#145;The Storm&#146; shows that Islwyn was indebted to the popular contemporary Spasmodic school for much of his stance as a poet. Islwyn followed Alexander Smith's <span class="italic">Life-Drama</span> (1853) in holding that the poet's duty was to go forward &#145;in his spirit's strength&#146; to wring meaning from &#145;the questions of all time&#146;. The poet was an intensely imaginative, uniquely sensitive, suffering being, able to pursue these &#145;king thoughts&#146; in divinely inspired (and often long-winded) poems, finally asserting what another spasmodic, Philip James Baily, described as &#145;confidence in God and good&#146;. In addition, Islwyn admired Ralph Waldo Emerson and welcomed the American's emphasis on the poet as a prophetic interpreter who should rise above &#145;stock poetry&#146; and &#145;the coils of rhythm and number&#146;. This influence helped the Welsh poet to stand apart from the laboured arguments in Wales about the appropriate metre for epic poetry, freeing him to make lively use of a variety of metres (but favouring blank verse), including a pastiche of Longfellow's <span class="italic">Hiawatha</span> medium and a section in strict metres. He also made consistent and effective use of the Romantic reconciliation of opposites. The grave is a beginning not an end, and is to be welcomed, not feared. The night is full of stars. The storm signifies judgment, death, and destruction, but is followed by peace and happiness. Suffering inspires spiritual victory. The poet of &#145;The Storm&#146; is Carlyle's hero-soul, seeking to show the ultimate harmony of the apparent opposites and inconsistencies in spiritual life and nature.<br>
<br>Islwyn never again wrote anything to equal this multi-layered poem, which stands unique in nineteenth-century Welsh literature. He went on to busy himself with preaching and editing the poetry columns in several periodicals and newspapers and to reassume the familiar role of a competitive eisteddfod poet and adjudicator, winning prizes but never a major national eisteddfod prize. Always delicate, by 1877 his health was deteriorating, and he died at Y Glyn, Ynys-ddu, on 20 November 1878, saying, according to the testimony of his niece, &#145;I am going to Anne now&#146;. He was buried at Y Glyn seven days later. The unfortunate legacy of &#145;Y storm&#146; was the creation of a school of so-called new poets in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Islwyn had sought to make poetry a unique method of understanding man's relation to nature and God, but the attempts of the new poets to imitate him were feeble, lacking his conviction and originality.<br>
