<span class="headword">Dynham,  John</span>, Baron Dynham  (<em>c.</em>1433&#150;1501), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son and heir of Sir John Dynham and his wife, Elizabeth, the sister and heir of John Arches. At Nutwell in Devon since at least 1122 and patrons of Hartland Abbey, the Dinhams or Dynhams [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54520/', "Dinham family")</script>] were a leading family of gentry in the county. There were five successive Sir John Dynhams: Lord Dynham's grandfather, who died in 1428, left a widow who survived until 1465; his father's widow occupied Nutwell itself until her death in 1496. Thus John, Lord Dynham, who was twenty-four and more when he entered his father's lands in 1458, held his whole ancestral estate only very briefly: some compensation was afforded by his first marriage in 1467 to the widowed Elizabeth Ratcliffe (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fitzwalter), whose heir was her son from her previous marriage.<br>
<br>Quite how Dynham was connected with the Yorkist earls is unclear. In 1459 he accompanied them to Devon, where they may have stayed at his mother's house at Nutwell, and it was he who purchased them the balinger for &pound;40 that carried them first to Guernsey and thence to Calais. He was attainted with them at the Coventry parliament of 1459. From Calais he led two successful raids against the king's forces at Sandwich in 1460, capturing Lord Rivers on the first and being wounded on the second. Following the Yorkist victory he was appointed sheriff of Devon and, in November, chancellor of Ireland. He fought for Edward IV at Towton, was a member of the new king's household by July 1461, and was granted the custody of the lands of the widowed Elizabeth Fulford. However, Dynham's rewards came slowly and contrast sharply with those of Humphrey Stafford of Southwick, earl of Devon. Whereas Stafford's interests spanned all five south-western counties and he rapidly monopolized royal office and succeeded to the pre-eminence of the Courtenays, Dynham's importance was essentially within Devon and he had some limited interests in Cornwall. It is significant that all four of his sisters married into families prominent only in Devon and Cornwall, two of them baronial: lords Fitzwarine and Zouche, Sir John Carew and Sir Thomas Arundel of Lanherne. Dynham was granted eight Hungerford manors in 1464, but was unable to make his title good and had to content himself with a &pound;100 annuity. His summons to parliament as Lord Dynham of Cardenham on 28 February 1467 was unaccompanied by any other grant. Following Stafford's execution in 1469 he became steward of all his lands and keeper of the forests of Exmoor and Neroche for life, but the Courtenay lands were granted in turn to the Marquess Montagu (1470) and George, duke of Clarence (1471), who was resident at Tiverton Castle and politically active in Devon for part of each year. The Courtenay lands were kept in royal hands after Clarence's death in 1478.<br>
<br>Dynham was a member of the royal council in London during Warwick's coup in the summer and of Edward's great council in the autumn of 1469. He was ordered to act against the rebels the following March when, however, he inadvertently helped them. Dynham and the other commissioners were besieged in Exeter by the Courtenays of Bocannoc, perhaps before the king's commission arrived, and were relieved by Warwick and Clarence. It may have been at this time that Clarence extorted money from him, for which he was compensated with an annuity of &pound;100 on the duke's fall. In 1471 Dynham was one of the commissioners who fined those who had rebelled with Thomas Neville, the Bastard of Fauconberg, in Kent. In 1475 he was commander of the fleet during Edward IV's Picquigny campaign and he was sworn as a royal councillor with a further annuity of &pound;100. In 1480 he was granted the former Courtenay manor of Thorne. Already Lord Hastings's lieutenant at Calais in 1483, Dynham was retained as such by Richard III and was not promoted to the captaincy of Calais. Even though his west country importance was recognized by his appointment as chief forester of Dartmoor, steward of Bradninch, and the chief steward and surveyor of the duchy of Cornwall, it was not he but Sir Richard Ratcliffe and others who secured the major grants of forfeited lands in the west country. Offices and annuities he had secured, but the family patrimony was little changed.<br>
<br>While Dynham did not betray King Richard, he evidently had better connections with Henry VII, most probably through Robert Willoughby, steward of the king's household, who was created Lord Willoughby de Broke. Dynham married Willoughby's sister Elizabeth in or after 1485. His brother-in-law Lord Zouche had been attainted and his sister therefore impoverished, so in 1488 Dynham was one of those granted 100 marks a year on her behalf. However, Dynham was not to be the king's man in the west country, but instead a royal minister and courtier. Elected knight of the Garter before 23 April 1487, he was appointed treasurer of England on 14 July 1486 and remained in office until his death. He was a frequent commissioner not just in Devon but elsewhere: indeed in 1497 he was one of those commissioned to act as constable and marshal of England for the trial of the rebel James, Lord Audley, who was duly executed. Henceforth, it seems, he was occupied continually at the exchequer at Westminster and resided for convenience at his house at Lambeth. It was there that his only two children died: George (<i>b</i>. before 1470) in 1487 and Philippa in 1485; both were buried at Lambeth church. It was there also that he died on 28 January 1501. He was buried two days later at the London Greyfriars. At his death he possessed a great stock of plate. As his three younger brothers Charles, Roger, and the clerk Oliver had also died childless, Dynham was the last of his line: his lands were divided among the families of his four sisters. A bastard son, Thomas, was endowed with land in Buckinghamshire.<br>
