<span class="headword">Welton,  Richard</span>  (1671/2&#150;1726), <span class="occ">clergyman of the nonjuring Church of England</span>, was born at Framlingham, Suffolk, the son of Thomas Welton, druggist, of Woodbridge, Suffolk. First educated at Woodbridge, he was admitted on 3 March 1688 to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, aged sixteen, and graduated BA (1692), MA (1695), and DD (1708). He was married to Temperance Goodwyn, and they had at least one child, Richard, who was baptized at Whitechapel in 1708.<br>
<br>Welton was ordained in 1695 and served as rector of St Mary's, Whitechapel, London, from 1697 to 1715. To his rectory, the vicarage of East Ham, Essex, was added in 1710. A friend and supporter of fellow London minister Henry Sacheverell, in 1710 Welton preached the controversial sermon <span class="italic">The Wise Man's Counsel upon the Test</span>, which attacked occasional conformity, which he claimed &#145;abused and perverted&#146; the Lord's supper &#145;to countenance and secure the PATRIOTS of Resistance, in places of great station and power&#146;  (R. Welton, <span class="italic">The Wise Man's Counsel upon the Test</span>, 1710, Preface). The sermon also defended absolute monarchy and urged active obedience to the monarchy, except where contrary to God's word, in which circumstances one &#145;must submit and yield Passive Obedience unto them&#146;, withstanding the government only with tears and prayers  (ibid., 9). The sermon drew an anonymous response entitled <span class="italic">Solomon Against Welton</span> (1710), which raised the spectre of Jacobitism. Further controversy arose in 1713 when Welton had the portrait painter James Fellowes create a new altarpiece for Whitechapel which portrayed Bishop White Kennett as Judas at the last supper. Kennett appealed to the bishop of London to have the painting removed and in April 1714 he succeeded, despite Welton's claim that the bishop's own chancellor had asked only that minor changes be made to the painting. Welton's response to the controversy, a sermon entitled <span class="italic">Church Ornament without Idolatry Vindicated</span> (1714), defended the piece, suggesting that opposition to it was political in nature for it had offended &#145;the very scum of a whigg-faction&#146;  (Welton, Preface). Welton's Jacobite sympathies were also expressed in his sermon &#145;The shipwreck of faith&#146;, preached in honour of Queen Anne's memory. There he spoke of the Stuart name being &#145;hateful to our Enemies, but the glory of our Country&#146;  (R. Welton, <span class="italic">The Substance of the Christian Faith and Practice</span>, 1724, 261&#150;2). He then suffered deprival from his clerical positions on 3 March 1715 after he failed to appear and take the oath of allegiance in October 1714.<br>
<br>After his deprival Welton led a nonjuring congregation in Whitehall, London. In 1717 government agents raided his chapel in Goodman's Fields, finding there a gathering of 250 people. Those assembled were requested to take the oaths of abjuration, which Welton and forty others refused. Consecrated irregularly to the nonjuring episcopate in 1722 by Ralph Taylor of the nonusager party, he went to America in 1724 and was called as rector of Christ Church, Philadelphia, on 27 July 1724. There he published a collection of eighteen sermons, including a reprinting of &#145;Church ornament without idolatry vindicated&#146;, published at the request of the Whitechapel congregation, under the title <span class="italic">The Substance of the Christian Faith and Practice</span> (1724). Welton also translated, as <span class="italic">The Sufferings of the Son of God</span> (1720), the <span class="italic">Trabalhos de Jesus</span> written by the Portuguese mystic Thomas of Jesus (1529&#150;1582). He served at Christ Church, despite the objections of William Keith, the governor of Pennsylvania, until he was requested to return to England by royal writ in January 1726. There is no evidence that he exercised episcopal jurisdiction, and at his request the church in Philadelphia prepared a testimonial to his conduct. He went instead to Lisbon, in Portugal, where he seems to have had some connections. He died there on 22 July 1726.<br>
