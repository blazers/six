<span class="headword">Hilder,  Rowland Frederick</span>  (1905&#150;1993), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at Great Neck, Long Island, New York, on 28 June 1905, the son of Roland Hilder (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1880) and his wife, Kitty, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fissenden (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1885), both originally from Birling, Kent. The &#145;w&#146; in his forename originated from a misspelling on his birth registration form. His parents had moved to America shortly after their marriage, his father working first as a butler and then as a tour organizer for Americans visiting Britain. After Hilder's birth they moved to an apartment in Manhattan, New York, off Central Park, before settling in Morristown, New Jersey, where Hilder went to school. They made annual visits home to see his grandparents at Birling, where a memorial plaque to the artist stands in the churchyard. In 1915 the family returned to England for good (his father enlisting in the Royal Horse Artillery), living above a tobacconist's shop in New Cross, London, which Hilder's father bought for his wife in case he did not return from the war.<br>
<br>In 1921, aged sixteen, Hilder enrolled at Goldsmiths' College, London, where he was tutored by the noted illustrator Edmund J. Sullivan, to whom he was to acknowledge a lifelong debt as his own career developed as an illustrator and draughtsman. Commissions followed, ranging from Mary Webb's <span class="italic">Precious Bane</span> (1930), to the cover wrapper for a new book by C. S. Forester, an Oxford University Press edition of <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span> (1929), and various marine subjects and boys' adventure stories. On 17 December 1929 he married Edith Elizabeth Blenkiron (1903/4&#150;1992), a fellow student and botanical artist, and daughter of Robert Henry Blenkiron, a boot and shoe buyer. They had one son, Anthony Rowland&#151;himself an artist, under the <i>nom de brosse</i> Anthony Fleming&#151;and a daughter, Mary.<br>
<br>The popularity of Hilder's work was a testimony to the place he held in people's affections&#151;not only in his beloved England but everywhere where &#145;the Englishness of English art&#146; struck a reminiscent chord. It is hard to think of any landscape painter of his generation whose work was so widely accessible. He shared with John Constable the distinction of having seen, in his own lifetime, an entire region of England identified with his name and art. The description &#145;Rowland Hilder country&#146; (attached primarily to the weald of Kent) evokes a landscape as distinctive and personal as &#145;Constable's country&#146; along the Suffolk Stour.<br>
<br>As an artist Hilder had two lifelong loves: the Thames, which he explored as a boy, and which prompted his early ambition to become a marine painter, and the Shoreham valley, that corner of Kent beloved of Samuel Palmer as his own &#145;valley of vision&#146;. Hilder's drawings of moored sailing barges, his earliest exercises in documentary draughtsmanship, gave him a feeling for the great waterway that in those days was an artery of the empire. He immersed himself in the skills and crafts of the seaman, taught himself to sail, and worked happily amid the clatter and clamour of London's dockland, sketching scenes that few of his admirers ever set eyes on. All this gave his marine subjects the smack of authentic observation, as his exhibits at the Royal Society of Marine Artists testified. His Shoreham experience, on which his fame as a landscape painter came to be based, dated from his student days at Goldsmiths' College. As it happened, the Shoreham valley was the first stretch of undeveloped countryside, still a rich farming and hop-growing area, that Hilder and his fellow students could easily reach by train or bicycle. He himself was to return to it over and over again, walking its lanes, revisiting its farmsteads, studying its moods and the pastoral drama of the seasons. It remained a fixed point in his imaginative universe, the epicentre of his popularity as a landscape painter.<br>
<br>More generally, Hilder found all he needed in the familiar middle-ground of English art, a territory identified in the hugely popular exhibition at London's Hayward Gallery, &#145;The British landscape, 1920&#150;1950&#146;, as &#145;a constant negotiation between pastoral and modernising tendencies, with the pastoral usually in the ascendant&#146;  (Jeffrey, 7). That certainly holds for Hilder, except that modernizing tendencies were seldom apparent. He remained true to the instinctively natural images of his local painting: horses, corn stooks, hay wains&#151;not the mechanical uproar of a later age. John and Paul Nash, Eric Ravilious, Edward Bawden, and Graham Sutherland were among contemporaries of Hilder's who shared and promoted this distinctively English mood between the two world wars. Geoffrey Grigson, who supplied the text for Rowland and Edith Hilder's illustrations for <span class="italic">The Shell Guide to Flowers of the Countryside</span> (1955), wrote of the latent emotion, for the English, of words such as &#145;hill&#146; and &#145;tree&#146; and &#145;green&#146;, sensing in them origins almost beyond recall. Hilder remained close to this tradition. His images still stay in the mind, half-remembered, yet still within ken. The typical &#145;Hilderscape&#146; is for the most part a land of plenty, in an untroubled heartland, most often stripped of its summer graces and clad in the naked decency of winter.<br>
<br>Distinguished as he was in oils, Hilder was at his most eloquent in watercolour&#151;&#145;the most wonderful medium of expression yet invented&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">Rowland Hilder Sketching Country</span>, 8). He marvelled that he and his generation, when they started out to be artists, seemed totally unaware of the long line of creative achievement that stretches back in English art form to Cozens, Girtin, Turner, Cotman, and the Norwich men. Such names, he said, were never on his own teachers' lips, nor was he taught watercolour painting. Finding out for himself was a continuous process, both technical and artistic. One of his satisfactions was to notice how often his beloved predecessors in the English school broke away from orthodoxy, mixing media and methods, as Hilder himself liked to do in his own on-the-spot studies, whether impromptu notes or first thoughts towards more considered work to come.<br>
<br>Hilder was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1938, becoming vice-president in 1959 and president in 1964, a post he held for ten years. He taught at Farnham School of Art, Surrey, and in London taught at Blackheath School of Art, and was professor of art at Goldsmiths' College. He was appointed OBE in 1986. In his latter years he was an active member of the Fellowship Party. He died of heart failure at the Greenwich District Hospital, Greenwich, London, on 21 April 1993, and was cremated at Sidcup crematorium. He was survived by his son and daughter, his wife having died nine months previously. The Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours honoured him by instituting an annual Rowland Hilder award in his memory.<br>
