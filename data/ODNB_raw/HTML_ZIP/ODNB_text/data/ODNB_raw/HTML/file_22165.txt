<span class="headword">Phillips,  John Roland</span>  (1844&#150;1887), <span class="occ">lawyer and antiquary</span>, the only son of David Phillips, was born in June 1844 at Cilgerran, Pembrokeshire. He received no regular education, but at an early age entered a solicitor's office in the neighbouring town of Cardigan. His legal studies led him to take a great interest in local history and antiquities, and in August 1866 he won the prize offered at Cardigan eisteddfod for the best essay on the history of Cilgerran. The publication of the essay, the <span class="italic">History of Cilgerran</span>, in an enlarged form in early 1867 was followed by Phillips's settlement in London. He entered Lincoln's Inn in November 1867, and was called to the bar on 10 June 1870. On 31 March 1873 he married Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Abraham Hargreaves of Nebraska, USA. Literary work still took up much of his time. From 1869 to 1871 he was employed by the duke of Norfolk as the keeper of archives at Norfolk House. He began the sorting and cataloguing of papers which was completed by his successor, Charles Kent. The schedule of title deeds and court rolls, which he drew up in 1870, is still held in the archives, which continue to work on the system established by him. <br>
<br>In 1874 Phillips published <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Civil War in Wales and the Marches</span>. A reviewer in the <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambriensis</span> of 1875 accused Phillips of bias towards the republican party in his narrative in the first volume of the work, but the collection of original documents in the second volume proved to be extremely valuable and the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> are still referred to by historians of seventeenth-century Wales. At the same time, Phillips was also involved, in conjunction with J. F. B. Firth, in collecting material relating to the history and management of the city companies, which led to the appointment of the commission of 1880. He was the first secretary of the Cymmrodorion Society after its revival in 1873, and published several further works of Welsh local history. His knowledge of documents relating to Wales in the British Museum was extensive.<br>
<br>On the formation of West Ham as a separate policy district, Phillips was appointed its first stipendiary magistrate on 22 June 1881. He contributed an essay on local taxation in England and Wales to the second volume of Cobden Club essays entitled <span class="italic">Local Government and Taxation</span> (1882). After a long illness, Phillips died at South Hampstead, where he lived, on 3 June 1887, leaving a widow and four children. At the time of his death he was working on histories of Tudor Wales and Welsh castles and abbeys.<br>
