<span class="headword">Blackwell,  Ebenezer</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1782), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born in Tewkesbury. In 1731 he joined Martin's Bank, Lombard Street, London, as principal clerk, later becoming a partner and retiring in 1780. In August 1739 George Whitefield entrusted to him the &pound;15 collected for his charity school at Kingswood when he preached on Blackheath, and this brought Blackwell into correspondence with John Wesley. His country home, The Limes, Lewisham, became Wesley's favourite retreat from the pressures of London life. A number of his sermons and other publications were written there and at the end of 1753 he spent five weeks recuperating from a serious illness under the devoted nursing of Blackwell's first wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mowland). On visiting the house in August 1782 with his brother Charles, Wesley wrote: &#145;We took one more walk round the garden and meadow, which he took so much pains to improve. Upward of forty years this has been my place of retirement when I could spare two or three days from London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 6.363). Elizabeth died on 27 March 1772 and Charles Wesley wrote an elegiac poem commemorating her piety. In the same year Blackwell married Mary Eden, the niece of Robert Lowth, bishop of London. It was at the Blackwells' home that Lowth and Wesley met and exchanged courtesies on 24 November 1777, the day after Wesley preached a sermon for the Humane Society in Lewisham church.<br>
<br>Blackwell's business acumen and experience were always at Wesley's disposal and their correspondence was full of financial as well as spiritual matters. Towards the end of his life he became one of the first trustees of the new City Road Chapel. Over the years he gave generous support to Wesley's charitable activities and Wesley did not hesitate to appeal to him when, for example, the growing number of poor coming to the dispensary at the Foundery Chapel left him desperately short of medicines. Wesley's letter of 4 February 1751 shows how meticulous he was, in his turn, in giving a detailed account of ways in which Blackwell's charitable gifts had been disbursed. At the same time Wesley repeatedly expressed his concern for the spiritual well-being of his Lewisham friend, seeing his &#145;natural cheerfulness of temper&#146; and fear of being &#145;singular&#146; as worldly temptations, and expressed the hope that he would be &#145;not almost only, but altogether a Christian&#146;  (16 May 1753, <span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 3.98&#150;9). He repeatedly warned him of the dangers inherent in being so fully occupied with financial responsibilities: &#145;Engaging in these temporal affairs is apt to dampen and deaden the soul&#146;  (14 May 1747, ibid., 2.97). &#145;Business itself, when it comes in such a flood upon you, must needs be one of the greatest temptations, since it naturally tends to hinder your waiting upon God &hellip; without distraction&#146;  (14 Aug 1748, ibid., 2.151). And in asking for Blackwell's help with his wife's financial affairs, Wesley prayed in the same letter that he might<blockquote>
<div>serve with careful Martha's hands<br>
</div>
<div>And loving Mary's heart.<br>
</div> (14 May 1751, ibid., 3.67)</blockquote>Blackwell became Wesley's most trusted confidant, with whom he shared both religious and marital problems. He had known Mrs Vazeille, probably through her first husband, before her marriage to Wesley, and may have been more than a passive observer of the events that led to that less-than-happy union. There was a period at the end of the 1750s when Mrs Wesley came near to effecting an estrangement between them. But the frankness they had nurtured over the years enabled their long association to hold firm. When Blackwell died on 21 April 1782, Charles Wesley wrote verses celebrating his old friend's philanthropy:<blockquote>
<div>Obedient both in word and deed,<br>
</div>
<div>By works his genuine faith he showed,<br>
</div>
<div>Rejoiced in Jesu's steps to tread<br>
</div>
<div>And spent his life in doing good.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Journal of &hellip; Charles Wesley</span>, 2.390)</blockquote>
