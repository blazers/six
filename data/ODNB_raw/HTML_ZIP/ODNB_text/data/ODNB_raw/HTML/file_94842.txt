<span class="headword">Ackroyd,  Peter Runham</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">Old Testament scholar</span>, was born on 15 September 1917 at 66 Stone Hill Road, Derby, the son of Jabez Robert Ackroyd, Congregational minister, and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown. When the family moved to Harrow, Middlesex, he attended the county boys' school. He matriculated from Downing College, Cambridge, in 1935 to read modern and medieval languages as an exhibitioner, and graduated in 1938. After theological study in London (BD, 1940; MTh, 1942) he returned to Cambridge as Stanton student at Trinity College (1941&#150;3), and received the degree of PhD in 1945 for a thesis on the criteria for the Maccabean dating of psalms. Meanwhile he was ordained a minister of the Congregational church in 1940. On 25 July the same year he married Evelyn Alice Nutt (<i>d</i>. 1990), a 25-year-old schoolteacher, and daughter of William Young Nutt, auctioneer and valuer. They had five children (two sons and three daughters).<br>
<br>Ackroyd served as minister of Congregational churches in Roydon, Essex (1943&#150;7) and Balham, London (1947&#150;8). In 1948 he was appointed lecturer in <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and Hebrew studies at Leeds University and in 1952 he became lecturer in divinity at the University of Cambridge. In 1957 he was ordained deacon in the Church of England and in 1958 priest, serving as honorary curate of Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge. In 1961 he was elected to the Samuel Davidson chair of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> studies at King's College, London, which he held until his retirement in 1982.<br>
<br>Drawing on his competence in German Ackroyd published, in 1957, an English translation of Ernst W&uuml;rthwein's <span class="italic">The Text of the Old Testament</span> and, in the same year, a translation of Ludwig K&ouml;hler's <span class="italic">Hebrew Man</span>. These were followed in 1965 by <span class="italic">The Old Testament: an Introduction</span>, a translation of the comprehensive work by Otto Eissfeldt, which was extensively revised and updated from the first German edition of 1934. These books provided major study tools for English-language readers; the latter volume in particular presented detailed surveys of the complex literary analyses of the sources, structures, and forms of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In 1968 Ackroyd published a revised version of his Hulsean lectures given in Cambridge in 1960&#150;62, as <span class="italic">Exile and Restoration: a Study of Hebrew Thought of the Sixth Century <span class="smallcap">BC</span></span>. This was his most original published writing and marked a fundamental rethinking of the literary consequences of the sixth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> in the formation of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. It proved a seminal work of historical research, highlighting the theme of continuity through experiences of crisis which Ackroyd also explored in several short essays and articles. He contributed a chapter on this Persian period to the first volume of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of Judaism</span> (1983).<br>
<br>The theme of continuity provided the subject of Ackroyd's inaugural lecture at King's College in 1962, in which he affirmed his regard for the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as the church's primary vehicle for upholding spiritual values. Both within the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and in its subsequent literary history, he traced the theme of continuity through periods of crisis and upheaval, returning to the theme repeatedly in numerous short perceptive studies. Both prophets and historians he regarded as agents fulfilling such a role.<br>
<br>Throughout his career in London he also made an extensive contribution as editor and promoter of popular commentaries, dictionaries, and surveys of current biblical research, encouraging a new generation of younger scholars to place a modern understanding of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> at the service of the church. He edited the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> volumes of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Commentaries on the New English Bible</span> for Cambridge University Press and, with James Barr, the <span class="roman">Old Testament Library</span> and <span class="roman">Studies in Biblical Theology</span> for the SCM Press. He was also instrumental in promoting and editing, with C. F. Evans, the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of the Bible</span> (vol. 1, 1975), which marked a new departure in awakening interest in the contribution of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to the history of ideas and to world literature. His short commentaries on several of the biblical historical books&#151;<span class="italic">1 Samuel</span> (1971), <span class="italic">2 Samuel</span> (1973), <span class="italic">1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">The Chronicler in his Age</span> (1991)&#151;reflected his close interest in historical writing as an expression of moral and spiritual vitality.<br>
<br>Ackroyd was assiduous in engaging and encouraging friends and colleagues to write for a wide readership, offering advice and urging the necessity of combining scholarship with piety and social commitment. He himself lectured extensively abroad and maintained close links with colleagues and former students internationally. He was honorary secretary of the Palestine Exploration Fund (1962&#150;70), editing its quarterly journal, and the annual <span class="italic">Book List</span> of the Society for Old Testament Study (1967&#150;73), becoming the society's president in 1972. He served as dean of the faculty of divinity at King's College, London, in 1968&#150;9 and was elected a fellow of the college in 1969; he served as dean of the university faculty of theology in 1976&#150;80. He was made a DD of the University of London in 1970 and an honorary DD of the University of St Andrews the same year.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, on 7 September 1991 Ackroyd married Ann Golden, aged fifty-seven, also a schoolteacher, and the daughter of Arthur James Golden, sales representative. He died on 23 January 2005 at Littleport Grange nursing home, Grange Lane, Littleport, Cambridgeshire, and was survived by his second wife, two sons, and two daughters, one daughter having predeceased him.<br>
