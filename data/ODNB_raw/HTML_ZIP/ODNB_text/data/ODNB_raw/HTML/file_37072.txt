<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  Francis  Brett</span>  (1884&#150;1954), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 29 June 1884 at The Laurels, Halesowen, Worcestershire, the eldest son of Thomas Brett Young (<i>b</i>. 1855), a doctor, and his wife, Elizabeth (Annie) Jackson (1858&#150;1898), daughter of John Jackson, a surgeon of Somerby, Leicestershire. From 1895 until 1901 he was educated at Epsom College, Surrey, where he won the Sands Cox scholarship to the University of Birmingham. In 1907 he gained a first-class medical degree and settled in practice at Brixham, Devon.<br>
<br>On 28 December 1908 Brett Young married Jessie, later Jessica (1883&#150;1970), daughter of John Hankinson, a farmer; she was a teacher of physical training who later became a concert singer. &#145;In between epidemics&#146; he began to write novels, his first, <span class="italic">Undergrowth</span>, co-authored with his brother Eric and published in 1913. It was followed a year later by <span class="italic">Deep Sea</span>, spoken of as &#145;the Fisherman's <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146;, and in 1915 by <span class="italic">Dark Tower</span>, praised for its &#145;almost Jamesian subtlety of narrative method&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 March 1954). In these early novels he drew heavily on his work as a GP for the substance of his fiction, a trend which was to continue throughout his career, as all his novels are semi-autobiographical. His pre-war fiction enjoyed respectable reviews, and each book sold on average 2000 copies.<br>
<br>When the First World War broke out, Brett Young joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served with the 2nd (Rhodesian) regiment in Jan Smuts's campaign in east Africa. <span class="italic">Marching on Tanga</span> (1917) was inspired by his experiences and is one of the best depictions of east African life, but the campaign took a heavy toll on his health. In 1918 he was invalided out with the rank of major, and he and his wife moved to Capri.<br>
<br>While convalescing Brett Young published <span class="italic">The Crescent Moon</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">Poems, 1916&#150;1918</span> (1919), both influenced by his war experiences. In Capri he began to write his first essentially west midland stories, and after the publication of several unremarkable novels the appearance of <span class="italic">Portrait of Clare</span> in 1927 signalled the beginning of his career as a best-selling writer. It was his first great commercial success, won him the James Tait Black memorial prize, and was adapted for the stage in 1946 and made into a film in 1949. The <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> commented that &#145;We have to go back sixty years for any parallel in size and subject to this entirely English tale&#146;  (Young, 151). A year after <span class="italic">Portrait of Clare</span> the publication of <span class="italic">My Brother Jonathan</span> repeated this success, and in 1948 it was also made into a film; it was serialized on BBC television in 1985. The sales from the two novels enabled the Youngs to leave Capri and settle in the Lake District in England.<br>
<br>Between the wars Brett Young produced at least one novel a year, works which appealed to both the general public and the critics. John Masefield saw him as &#145;the most gifted, most interesting mind amongst the younger men writing English&#146;  (Young, 146). His novels, however, suffered from their great length&#151;most were over 600 pages long&#151;and their repetitiveness of plot and character. His belief that a medical training and a doctor's career were the best ways for a novelist to learn about humanity began to backfire; as it has been calculated that, up to and including <span class="italic">White Ladies</span> (1935), there were no fewer than thirty-three doctors of medicine in his work, an average of 3.38 per novel  (Twitchett, 281). <span class="italic">A Man about the House</span> (1942; adapted for film in 1947) was his last novel to enjoy anything like the success of his writing of the late twenties; and <span class="italic">The Island</span> (1944), an ambitious verse history of England from the viking invasion to the latest Nazi attempt, was largely ignored. He was awarded the honorary degree of DLitt from the University of Birmingham in 1950.<br>
<br>After the Second World War Brett Young retired to South Africa on medical advice, as he was suffering from a weak heart. He and his wife settled at Santici Montagu, near Cape Town. He died of heart failure at Tamboers Kloof Nursing Home, Cape Town, on 28 March 1954. His widow took his ashes to England, where they were placed in Worcester Cathedral. Despite his earlier success, &#145;His death passed almost unnoticed by the literary press&#146;  (Church, 13).<br>
