<span class="headword">Wilson,  Henry</span>  (1864&#150;1934), <span class="occ">architect and metalworker</span>, was born on 12 March 1864 at 91 Red Rock Street, West Derby, near Liverpool, the eldest of three surviving children, all sons, of William Henry Wilson, schoolmaster, and his wife, Clara Louisa Broadley. Wilson, who was to become one of the most original and versatile practitioners of the arts and crafts style, studied at Kidderminster School of Art, Westminster School of Art, and the Royal College of Art, before training as an architect in the offices of John Oldrid Scott and John Belcher. His appointment in 1888 as chief assistant to the fervent Gothicist John Dando Sedding encouraged the increasingly idiosyncratic tenor of his work. Sedding, a pivotal figure in the arts and crafts movement, was himself a practising craftsman in metal and embroidery. From Sedding, Henry Wilson absorbed the heady doctrine of architectural supremacy; he later maintained that an architect &#145;should be the invisible inspiring, ever active force animating all the activities necessary for the production of architecture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>, 5, 1898&#150;9, 188). Wilson too came to believe that it was the sacred duty of the architect to unite the crafts, conducting a dedicated orchestra of masons, carvers, woodworkers, metalworkers, glaziers, and embroiderers.<br>
<br>Wilson paid homage to his master in &#145;A memorial to the late J. D. Sedding&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">British Architect</span> after Sedding's sudden death in 1891. He then completed Sedding's plans for three London churches: Holy Redeemer, Clerkenwell; St Peter's, Ealing; and, most remarkably, Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, finest of arts and crafts churches and the subject of a poem by John Betjeman. He continued to practise architecture on his own account, designing a majestic free-style tower for St Clement's Church, Bournemouth (1895), and (with T. Phillips Figgis) the Notting Hill Library in Ladbroke Grove, London (1891&#150;4). Wilson was still at the height of his architectural powers in the middle 1890s, as evidenced by Brithdir church in north Wales (1845&#150;7) and his additions to Sedding's St Martin's Church at Marple, Cheshire (1895&#150;6 and <i>c</i>.1909). But he was now gradually moving away from built structures towards architectural metalwork and sculpture, and spent two years in a foundry learning professional techniques.<br>
<br>Wilson was unique among arts and crafts architects in his zest for the exotic and high-flown. He was a wonderful draughtsman, and his large-scale coloured drawings (many in the RIBA collection) summon up dream interiors, inspired by Byzantine art, extravagant in materials and heavy with symbolism. His sense of drama emerges most successfully in his redecoration of St Bartholomew's Church, Brighton (1898), with its soaring marble baldachin, gold mosaic ceiling, and beaten silver tabernacle door. Wilson also carried out spectacular schemes for the library at Welbeck Abbey (1889&#150;96) and the chapel and monument room at Wynyard Park, co. Durham (1903&#150;6), an Edwardian shrine in richly coloured marbles. His bronze and silver pulpit for Ripon Cathedral (1913) shows Wilson consciously reviving the use of beaten metal as a decorative architectural technique, as described in the biblical account of the building of King Solomon's temple. The ornate vinous symbolism amplifies Christ's statement &#145;I am the vine.&#146;<br>
<br>At the same time Wilson was working on a small scale, designing the most flamboyant and inventive British jewellery of its period, originating a full-blown arts and crafts mannerist style for gold and silver brooches, cloak and bolt clasps, necklaces, combs, and tiaras. These sumptuous articles were made either in his London workshop or, from 1909, at the Thatched House, St Mary's Platt, Kent, the rural thatched and whitewashed cottage which he acquired after his marriage on 1 August 1901 to Margaret Ellinor Morse (1869&#150;1931). Wilson's esoteric jewels were often decorated with enamelled panels, modelled figures, and unexpected combinations of, for instance, rock crystals, moonstones, and baroque drop pearls. They draw on Greek mythological and early Christian motifs. There is an impressive collection of his jewellery at the Victoria and Albert Museum; the Goldsmiths' Company, London, also holds some pieces by him.<br>
<br>Henry Wilson, often known as Harry, was described by Janet Ashbee as looking &#145;like a seedy bank clerk&#146;  (Ashbee journals, May 1899, King's Cam.). His portrait by Sir George Clausen (Art-Workers' Guild; since stolen) gives no impression of his inner fire. Wilson was an inveterate idealist, whose belief in the moral force of handwork dominated his life. As an energetic educationist and teacher, he was associated with W. R. Lethaby both at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and at the Royal College of Art. From 1896 to 1901 he was a quixotic first editor of the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>. In 1903 his handbook <span class="italic">Silverwork and Jewellery</span> was published in a series of technical handbooks edited by Lethaby and written by teachers from the Central School. His treatise <span class="italic">On Workmanship</span> (1912) propounded his belief that the moral health of a nation was revealed by the standards of its artefacts. This theme reappeared in his writings and lectures during and immediately after the First World War, which proposed a central role for the crafts in national regeneration.<br>
<br>For thirty years Henry Wilson was in the inner circle of the arts and crafts movement, becoming master of the Art-Workers' Guild in 1917 and president of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society from 1915 to 1922. In the view of his contemporary C. R. Ashbee he was &#145;one of the greatest Masters the Guild produced&#146;, but &#145;England wasted him as she wasted Alfred Stevens and Alfred Gilbert&#146;  (&#145;Masters of the Art-Workers' Guild&#146;, unpublished manuscript, part 3, 55). His combination of stubbornness and rash emotionalism certainly circumscribed his sphere of influence. He was the designer of the 1916 arts and crafts exhibition at the Royal Academy, controversial in its time and now regarded by many design historians as the swansong of the movement. His own professional career was in abeyance too, though his histrionic talents resurged in the design for the monument to Bishop Elphinstone at King's College, Aberdeen (<i>c</i>.1910&#150;31) and sculpture for Coventry Council House (1912&#150;1920) where the council chamber was richly decorated inside and outside with carvings based on animal and plant life, Lady Godiva, and other historical figures with associated heraldry, in an ambitious late flowering of Arts and Crafts eclecticism. He was always a superlative modeller, and his great bronze doors for the cathedral of St John the Divine, New York (<i>c</i>.1930), represent his final homage to Renaissance metalwork. In 1922, out of tune with the design for industry pressure groups and encroaching modernism, Wilson went to live in Paris. Family life, although impoverished, was happy and creative. The third of Wilson's four children was the violinist Orrea Pernel (who changed her name by deed poll); his youngest daughter, Dione Narona Margaris, became a well-known cookery writer and teacher [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/101356">Lucas,  Dione</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/101013">Lucas,  Colin</a>]. He was heartbroken when his wife died in 1931, and moved to Menton, where he died, weakened and suffering from Parkinson's disease, on 7 March 1934. The maker of magnificent monuments had no official grave.<br>
