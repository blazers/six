<span class="headword">Locke,  Joseph</span>  (1805&#150;1860), <span class="occ">railway engineer</span>, was born at Attercliffe, near Sheffield, on 9 August 1805, the fourth and youngest son of William Locke (<i>b</i>. 1770), colliery manager, and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Teesdale. He was educated at Barnsley grammar school, and from 1818 to 1820 was a pupil of William Stobart of Pelaw, co. Durham, a colliery viewer. In 1823 he was articled as a pupil engineer to George Stephenson at his works in Newcastle upon Tyne, and after the expiration of his time in 1826 stayed on with Stephenson, and was appointed one of his assistants in the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He was involved in the debate over the form of motive power to be used on the new railway, and in 1829, with Stephenson, published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Observations on the comparative merits of locomotive and fixed engines, being a reply to the report of Mr James Walker</span>, which finally settled the question in favour of locomotive engines. In 1834 he married Phoebe (1811&#150;1866), daughter of John McCreery.<br>
<br>Locke's first major project as a civil engineer after the completion of the Liverpool and Manchester was the first trunk railway line, the Grand Junction Railway between Birmingham and Warrington, for which he was to conduct the survey under the line's chief engineer, George Stephenson. The railway's directors were greatly impressed with Locke and indicated to him that they wished him to take sole charge of building the line, which angered Stephenson and led to a rift between the great engineer and his former pupil. A compromise of dividing work on the line between the two men was agreed; but Stephenson's tendency to delegate work to inexperienced assistants led to expensive mistakes and more ill feeling. In August 1835 Stephenson withdrew from the Grand Junction project, leaving the line's construction wholly in Locke's hands. His work on the Grand Junction established Locke's reputation for good engineering combined with economy and speed of construction, and he was soon in great demand as the pace of railway construction increased. Among the many lines he went on to construct in the British Isles the main line from London to Southampton (1836&#150;40) stands out for its directness and fine civil engineering, while the line between Sheffield and Manchester (1838&#150;40) and the Greenock, Paisley, and Glasgow line (1837&#150;41), with their steep gradients, are examples of Locke at his most daring. Abroad, he constructed the line between Paris and Rouen (1841&#150;3), and that between Rouen and Le Havre (1843), for which he was awarded the grand cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by Louis-Philippe. He also designed and supervised the construction of the line between Barcelona and Mattaro in Spain (1847&#150;8) and the Dutch&#150;Rhenish railway, completed in 1856. While working on the continent Locke took John Edward Errington into partnership in 1840, and together they constructed lines in Lancashire and north-western England, and many difficult lines in Scotland, including the Caledonian main line. They also constructed a line from Mantes to Caen and Cherbourg in 1852, for which Locke was created a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by Napoleon III. Despite the heavy civil-engineering works on the Caledonian Railway main line its cost, including the stations, was a relatively modest &pound;16,000 a mile. This economy resulted from the adoption of steeper gradients than had previously been thought suitable for railway locomotives, and proved that level track was not absolutely necessary to prevent a loss of power, especially given the continually improving performance of British locomotives during this period. Throughout his career Locke avoided undertaking very great and costly civil-engineering works, but he approached all his work with a dauntless determination to see the job through. He also had an unerring ability to select ideal collaborators, subcontractors, and assistants; a notable example was Thomas Brassey, whom Locke brought with him from the Grand Junction Railway to work on the Basingstoke to Winchester section of the London to Southampton line.<br>
<br>In 1847 Locke purchased the manor of Honiton, Devon, and sat in parliament as a Liberal for the borough of Honiton from that date to his death. He seldom spoke in the house except on matters within his special knowledge, but engaged in many parliamentary struggles, and took part in the &#145;battle of the gauges&#146;, favouring Stephenson's narrower gauge over Brunel's broad gauge.<br>
<br>Locke died suddenly at Moffat, near Dumfries, Scotland, on 18 September 1860. He was widely mourned; a window (since removed) was installed to his memory in Westminster Abbey, and an obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> referred to him as having formed, with Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the &#145;triumvirate of the engineering world&#146;. Locke was always proud of his Yorkshire origins, and left a number of legacies to institutions in that county, notably Barnsley grammar school. His widow presented Locke Park to the people of Barnsley in his memory, and in 1866 his statue was erected there.<br>
