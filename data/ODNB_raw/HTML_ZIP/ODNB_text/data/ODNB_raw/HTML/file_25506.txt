<span class="headword">Sibson,  Thomas</span>  (1817&#150;1844), <span class="occ">book illustrator</span>, son of Francis Sibson, an unsuccessful farmer, and his wife, Jane, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25505/', "Francis Sibson MD (1814&#150;1876)")</script>, was born in the parish of Cross Canonby, Cumberland, in March 1817, and baptized along with his four brothers in 1819 after the family moved to Edinburgh. Sibson initially trained as an accountant and until he was nearly twenty-one he worked in his uncle's mercantile firm at Manchester. Then late in 1837, despite his family's disapproval, he left the firm and moved to London, where he studied with the painter Ralph Nicholson Wornum (1812&#150;1877), later keeper of the National Gallery. Over the next several years Sibson, &#145;a pictorial Boz&#146;  (Grego, 1.456), published extra illustrations to Dickens's <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span> (ten etchings and illustrated wrapper, 1838) and <span class="italic">Master Humphrey's Clock</span> (seventy-two etchings in eighteen monthly parts, 1840&#150;41; copies were re-etched by J. Yeager for the Philadelphia edition of <span class="italic">Barnaby Rudge</span>), alongside <span class="italic">Sibson's Sketches of Life and Humour</span> (1838).<br>
<br>Sibson was a tall, sinewy youth with a winning manner, quaint humour, and earnest determination, who quickly earned the devoted friendship of the poet and painter William Bell Scott (1811&#150;1890) and the wood-engraver William James Linton (1812&#150;1897). He produced many octavo drawings for Linton's projected <span class="italic">History of England</span>, then tore them up before they were carved into the block and replaced them on a larger scale. His work, exploiting a sprightly brio, clean linearity, and considerable antiquarianism, received high praise from friends and later critics. He was much in demand, designing many of the illustrations to Samuel Carter Hall's <span class="italic">Book of Ballads</span> and the Abbotsford edition of the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels. Moved by the plans to decorate the rebuilt houses of parliament with frescoes depicting British history, Sibson decided to become a history painter. In September 1842, after taking a strenuous walking tour through Wales with Linton, Sibson went to Munich to study with Wilhelm von Kaulbach (1804&#150;1874), court painter to Ludwig I. Although Kaulbach had ceased to take pupils, he was so impressed by Sibson that he gave the student free lessons and studio space. But Sibson, suffering from advanced tuberculosis, was compelled by his failing health to return home early in 1844. Too weak to walk, he was cared for by Linton, who brought him wild flowers from Hampstead Heath for him to draw. Richard Twentyman of Bennoch and Twentyman, silk and gimp dealers, provided money for Sibson to winter at Malta. Accompanied by Linton, Sibson set forth from Newcastle; their ship struck a reef on the Yorkshire coast and they barely made it to land. He then stayed with his physician brother in Nottingham for a few weeks to recover his strength before once more setting out for Malta. Shortly after arriving there he died, on 28 November 1844. An album containing 1426 chalk, ink, and watercolour studies that Sibson made before his visit to Munich was bequeathed to Scott, purchased at the sale of Scott's collections in 1890 by Linton, and by him presented to the British Museum. Another sketchbook is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
