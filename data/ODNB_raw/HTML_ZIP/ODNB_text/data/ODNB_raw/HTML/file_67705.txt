<span class="headword">Tomlinson,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1650&#150;1696), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was probably from the North Riding of Yorkshire, and may have been the person of this name who matriculated as a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, in Michaelmas term 1632 and graduated BA in 1637. According to George Fox, Tomlinson was a priest (by which he meant an Anglican clergyman) before becoming a Quaker. Tomlinson served as a lieutenant in Colonel Thomas Saunders's regiment of horse, but he claimed that he was dismissed in 1650 for opposing Saunders's views when the regiment was at Derby. However, when Tomlinson unsuccessfully sought reinstatement in June 1659, Saunders insisted he had voluntarily relinquished his commission, claiming to be lame and unable to participate in the campaign against the Scots.<br>
<br>In or before 1653 Tomlinson became a Quaker. In the first of his many tracts, <span class="italic">A Word of Reproof to the Priests or Ministers</span> (1653; 3rd edn., 1656), he castigated the Church of England's clergy as deceivers who boast of their ministry and sacraments while disdaining and persecuting others. The kings of the earth, he averred, commit fornication with the clergy because of their close relationship. Three years later, in a broadside entitled <span class="italic">A Bosome Opened to the Jews</span>, he added his voice to those urging the readmission of Jews to England. When James Nayler was tried by parliament in December 1656, Tomlinson, Fox, and Robert Rich submitted statements pertaining to the case. Tomlinson challenged parliament to define and prove the alleged blasphemy, for embracing Christ was not such an offence. In seeking to kill God's enemies, he warned, the MPs were in reality slaying his children. The statements were published as <span class="italic">Copies of some few of the papers given unto the house of parliament in the time of James Naylers tryal there</span> (1656). The following year Tomlinson published <span class="italic">Seven Particulars</span>, which opened with a powerful condemnation of those who oppress the poor, not least by charging exorbitant rents. Such oppressors, he proclaimed, are the pharaohs and taskmasters of the earth. He also denounced capital punishment for theft, the importance attributed to one's ancestry, compulsory tithes, and the persecution of Quakers who proclaimed their message of the inner light in traditional churches.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Tomlinson was imprisoned in the North Riding for refusing to take an oath. In <span class="italic">A Word of Information to them that Need it</span> (1660) he denounced episcopacy as unscriptural and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> as replete with evil. &#145;<i>A Cup of Fornication</i>&#146;, by which he meant &#145;a Pack of mens Inventions and Traditions&#146;, is spreading through the nations, intoxicating them  (pp. 18&#150;19). About the same time he wrote <span class="italic">A Position Concerning Persecution</span> (1660?), arguing that any religion which persecutes those who follow their consciences is an abomination. From Beaudesert, Warwickshire, on 30 August 1669, Sir Bryan Broughton reported to Joseph Williamson that Tomlinson, whom he described as a former eminent officer, had warned that civil war would ensue if people were not free to attend conventicles. In <span class="italic">An Awakening Voice to the Papists</span> (1673) Tomlinson accused the Catholic church of espousing doctrines and practices from the bottomless pit and labelled the pope &#145;that Man of Sin&#146;  (p. 27). His next work, <span class="italic">An Epistle to the Flock</span> (1674), reminded fellow Friends of the need to expel those whose religion was only formal; Quakers must walk in the light, not merely talk about it. In May 1675 Fox wanted Tomlinson to found a school to teach languages and botany, apparently in conjunction with the schoolmaster and botanist Thomas Lawson, but nothing came of this. Tomlinson renewed his attack on the Catholics in 1679, when he published <span class="italic">The principles of the papists &hellip; plainly demonstrated by the scriptures to be most erroneous and wicked</span>. He followed this in 1684 with <span class="italic">A Synopsis, or Short View of Essential Christianity in Part</span>, which reflects the Quakers' interest in the primitive church. The Catholics again occupied his attention, this time in <span class="italic">Innovations of Popery</span> (1689). The Finch manuscripts contain a letter dated 10 June 1690 from William III to the earl of Nottingham, directing him to do as he saw fit with a petition from Tomlinson to the countess of Derby. Tomlinson's final tract (and the last that is known of him), <span class="italic">A Short Work, but of the Greatest Concern</span>, was published in 1696. In his later years Tomlinson continued to manifest the stridency that characterized some of the earliest Friends, as reflected by the fact that in the 1670s and 1680s six of his tracts were edited or rejected by his colleagues.<br>
