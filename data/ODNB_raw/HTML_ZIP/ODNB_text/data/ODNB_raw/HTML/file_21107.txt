<span class="headword">Paget,  Francis Edward</span>  (1806&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born on 24 May 1806, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21106/', "General Sir Edward Paget (1775&#150;1849)")</script> and his first wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1806), daughter of William, first Baron Bagot. He was educated at Westminster School, where he was admitted on 16 September 1817; he proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 3 June 1824. From 1825 to 1836 he held a studentship, and graduated BA in 1828 and MA in 1830. He became rector of Elford, near Lichfield, in 1835, and for some years was chaplain to Richard Bagot, bishop of Bath and Wells. On 2 June 1840 he married Fanny (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of William Chester, rector of Denton, Norfolk, with whom he had six daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Paget was an early and consistent supporter of the Oxford Movement, and in common with other Tractarian clergy he exploited the contemporary popularity of the novel to disseminate the ideas of the movement to a wider audience. In 1840 he began to contribute to <span class="roman">The Englishman's Library</span> (vols. 9, 16, and 18) with his <span class="italic">Tales of the Village</span> (3 vols., 1840&#150;41), short stories designed to show how the parochial life of the Church of England could be revived. In 1841 followed <span class="italic">St Antholin's, or, Old Churches and New: a Tale for the Times</span>, which dealt with the problems of raising funds for church restoration. In 1842 came <span class="italic">Milford Malvoisin, or, Pews and Pewholders</span>, significant for its early criticism of the social fractures resulting from pewed churches, and in which Paget argued that, as a consequence, &#145;the wealthy few have driven, in many places, the Poor from our Churches&#146;.<br>
<br>In his own parish of Elford, Paget implemented in a practical way the ideas advocated in his fiction. As with other Tractarian clergy he introduced the practice of daily morning and evening prayer in the church, and began to increase the frequency with which holy communion was celebrated. He raised funds to restore the building, including the collection of pennies from the children for a new font. The reopening of the restored church was celebrated on 2 August 1849, during which Paget preached a sermon published as <span class="italic">The Destinies of God's Temples</span> (1849). The annual dedication festival became, in subsequent years, an important meeting place for Staffordshire clergy. Further restoration work in 1869 was followed by his published account of the church in 1870.<br>
<br>Paget's literary output was also notable for the variety of its subject matter. In 1840 he edited Bishop Simon Patrick's <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning Prayer</span> and <span class="italic">Treatise of Repentance and Fasting</span>, similar to Newman's reprints from the writings of English bishops. He wrote for children in <span class="roman">The Juvenile Englishman's Library</span> from 1845, including two series of <span class="italic">Tales of Village Children</span>, and for some while was editor of this collection. Under the pseudonym William Churne of Staffordshire he wrote the fairy tale <span class="italic">The Hope of the Katzekopfs</span> in 1844. In 1859 his novel <span class="italic">The Curate of Cumberworth and the Vicar of Roost</span> was published as a warning to his fellow clergy not to be too enthusiastic or to move too quickly in matters of parochial reform. <span class="italic">Lucretia, or, The Heroine of the Nineteenth Century</span> (1868) was a satire on the sensationalist novel. <span class="italic">The Pageant</span>, a novel deploring the employment conditions of milliners' apprentices, led to Paget's appearance as defendant in a successful libel case in 1844. He also published other novels, and volumes of sermons, prayers, and religious treatises.<br>
<br>Paget's final works continued this note of variety. In 1873 he privately printed <span class="italic">Some records of the Ashtead estate and of its Howard possessors: with notices of Elford, Castle Rising, Levens, and Charlton</span>, an uncritical compilation from family papers and other private sources. <span class="italic">A Student Penitent of 1695</span>, based on seventeenth-century letters between an Oxford undergraduate and his tutor, followed in 1875. <span class="italic">Homeward Bound</span> in 1876 was a series of meditative essays about preparation for death, in a style typical of the period. Paget died at his rectory in Elford on 4 August 1882, and was buried there on 8 August.<br>
