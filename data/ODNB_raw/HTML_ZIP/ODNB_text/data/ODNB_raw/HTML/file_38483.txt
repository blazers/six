<span class="headword">Nicholson,  John William</span>  (1881&#150;1955), <span class="occ">mathematical physicist</span>, was born on 1 November 1881 at 7 High Terrace, Darlington, first child of John William Nicholson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1853), ironworks clerk (afterwards a works manager, of Redcar), and his wife, Alice Emily (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1860), daughter of John Kirton, painter. Nicholson had a brother and two sisters. From Middlesbrough high school he went to the University of Manchester where he graduated BSc in physics in 1902 and MSc in 1905. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1902 and was equal tenth wrangler in part one of the mathematical tripos of 1904 and gained a 1:2 in part two in 1905. He won the Isaac Newton studentship in 1906 and numerous other awards and prizes. He also took a London BSc (second class in mathematics, first class in experimental physics, 1903) and DSc (1906).<br>
<br>In 1912 Nicholson was appointed (controversially, as there was an established internal candidate) professor of mathematics in the University of London at King's College. He collaborated there with T. R. Merton on the measurement and interpretation of spectral line intensities. Balliol College, Oxford, recruited him as fellow and tutor in mathematics and physics in 1921, and he became a university lecturer in mathematics at Oxford in 1927. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1917 (council member 1920&#150;21), and was an influential member of many scientific bodies, including the Royal Astronomical Society (a fellow from 1911), the R&ouml;ntgen Society (president 1921&#150;2), and the British Association committee on mathematical tables (chairman 1920&#150;30).<br>
<br>Nicholson assisted Arthur Schuster with the third edition of <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Theory of Optics</span> (1924), and made some ninety journal contributions on diverse topics. His most significant work was on an atomic structure model he derived from a study of unassigned lines in the spectra of stellar nebulae and the solar corona. This he unveiled at the Portsmouth British Association meeting of August 1911, and developed in <span class="italic">Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</span> during 1912. In his first note (dated from Trinity College, 25 October 1911), he described an atomic model comprising a tiny heavy positively charged nucleus around which electrons rotated in a circular orbit equidistant from each other. A four-electron element which he called &#145;nebulium&#146; was identified as the origin of the mysterious nebular lines, which he was able to account for quantitatively using the model. Turning to the coronal spectra, a further protoelement, &#145;protofluorine&#146;, was proposed. In his second note about it (dated again from Trinity, 28 April 1912) he introduced Planck's constant into his analysis, suggesting that &#145;the angular momentum of an atom can only rise or fall by discrete amounts&#146;. He appears to have been the first to relate quantum theory to atomic spectra. Niels Bohr knew of Nicholson's work and discussed it in the first of his 1913 trilogy on atomic structure  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, July 1913), tactfully objecting (<i>inter alia</i>) that Nicholson's model was inherently unstable. In his old age, Bohr was more dismissive: &#145;It was a play with numbers&#146;, he said  (Bohr).<br>
<br>In 1922, with the Astronomer Royal and the mistress of Girton among the witnesses, Nicholson married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53495/', "Dorothy Maud Wrinch (1894&#150;1976)")</script>, feminist and mathematician. In 1930, as Jean Ayling, she published a polemic on marriage and parenthood, <span class="italic">Retreat from Parenthood</span>. The couple had one child, Pamela (1927&#150;1975). In the later twenties Nicholson published little and his teaching deteriorated. In May 1930 he was treated in Norwood Sanatorium for alcoholism. Shortly afterwards a conjugal separation was agreed. On 12 October 1930 he was removed from Balliol to the Warneford Hospital in Oxford, where he was confined as a certified lunatic. Incurable insanity became a ground for divorce by the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Causes Act</span> of 1937; Nicholson and Wrinch were divorced in 1938. He died at the Warneford from heart disease on 10 October 1955. His funeral was held at Redcar four days later. Nicholson had made a will in favour of Wrinch on their wedding day; it was proved on her behalf despite their divorce and her remarriage.<br>
