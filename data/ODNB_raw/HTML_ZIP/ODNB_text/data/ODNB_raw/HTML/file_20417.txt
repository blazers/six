<span class="headword">Nye,  Philip</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1595, <em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born in Sussex and baptized on 19 January 1595, the ninth of eleven children of John Nye (<i>d</i>. 1626) of Hayes, Slinfold, Sussex, and his wife, Dorothy West (<i>d</i>. 1622). Like his elder brother, Henry Nye (1589&#150;1645), vicar of Cobham, Sussex, from 1615 to 1620 and rector of Clapham, Sussex, from 1620, Nye entered Brasenose College, Oxford, matriculating on 28 June 1616. He transferred to Magdalen Hall, where he was placed under &#145;a puritanical tutor&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.963) and earned the reputation of &#145;a very hard student&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.96). He graduated BA on 24 April 1619 and proceeded MA on 9 May 1622. He apparently began to preach in 1620. On 20 May 1624 he married Judith Keddington (<i>d</i>. 1680?); they had at least five sons and two daughters. In 1627 he became curate of All Hallows Staining, and in 1630 was lecturer at St Michael Cornhill, both in London.<h2>
<a name="OverseasactivitiesandearlyIndependency"></a>Overseas activities and early Independency</h2>In 1632 Nye was one of those who tried to persuade John Cotton, then in hiding in London, to conform but by August 1633 Nye himself was suspect as a nonconformist and it was rumoured that he would go with John Davenport to New England. He seems, however, to have remained in England: daughters were baptized at Hackney in March 1635 and June 1636, and in London he was associated with puritan colonizing ventures and through them forged early connections with influential dissidents. Already in 1632 he had links with Providence Island and in the same year was one of those to whom the earl of Warwick, as president of the Council for New England, granted joint tenancy of lands along the Connecticut River; over five years sales of cattle there netted &pound;161 15<i>s</i>. for Nye.<br>
<br>Some potential colonizers were disturbed by reports from Massachusetts Bay of the &#145;blurring of civil and religious jurisdictions&#146;, a theme to which Nye and other Independents frequently returned  (K. O. Kupperman, <span class="italic">Providence Island, 1630&#150;1641</span>, 1993, 326). The Connecticut River patentees prepared to act, and in the summer of 1635 Nye was a confidential intermediary and financial agent for the projected settlement, ensuring, as he said, that the younger John Winthrop, its governor, would enjoy &#145;all the advantages the busines will afford for your comfortable and creditfull going on in this project&#146;  (<span class="italic">Winthrop Papers</span>, 3.201). In September Nye reported on &#145;Gentlemen of the North&#146; who were &#145;in a way of selling off their estates with the greatest expedicion&#146;  (ibid., 3.211), and in November 1636 he represented other gentlemen who, in the interests of God and profit, were prepared to supply clothing to the colony at a reasonable rate in return for a monopoly of the trade. He was thus already engaged as a trusted agent whose skills in management and negotiation served both God and Mammon.<br>
<br>Nye's interest in New England survived the outbreak of civil war. In 1645 he and other Independents wrote to the general court in Boston deploring its persecution of Anabaptists. They pointed out that they themselves benefited from toleration &#145;from them whose established lawes and orders about the worship of god we Dissent from&#146; and that persecution by beneficiaries of such liberty would only encourage those who favoured &#145;such severityes&#146; to employ them against the Independents  (<span class="italic">Winthrop Papers</span>, 5.24).<br>
<br>Between 1636 and 1639 Nye and Thomas Goodwin published in London six of the works of Richard Sibbes, but by 1639 Nye was in the Netherlands, where he remained until 1640 as one of three ministers of an Independent church in Arnhem. Its prosperous congregation included some of the &#145;Gentlemen of the North&#146; from Yorkshire, and three of its members had been fellow Connecticut patentees with Nye. John Archer was &#145;pastor&#146; and Goodwin and Nye &#145;teachers&#146;, an arrangement later espoused by Nye for Independent congregations in England. Indeed, the Arnhem church was to become a model for later Independents. Only the truly godly&#151;so judged after thorough scrutiny&#151;were admitted, and the church provided an exemplary case of dispute resolution to which Nye and the Independent cadre in the Westminster assembly later reverted in their <span class="italic">Apologeticall Narration</span>. Nye's role in settling a conflict in the English church in Rotterdam demonstrated, they believed, that disputes within individual congregations could be resolved by the mediation of peer congregations without reference to an authoritative external body. His record was less pacific in his own church, where his censure of one member led to a long-running dispute and charges of &#145;pride [and] want of charity&#146;  (Edwards, 36).<br>
<br>By 1640 Nye, already in middle age, held fully formed views on church government and church&#150;state relations, and was committed to a church organization of non-parochial gathered churches rather than one of parochial congregationalism. When the times began to change in England most of the Arnhem congregation dispersed homewards, where Independents were for the first time confronted by the complex problem of the relation between gathered churches and a national parochial church system. Nye went first to Hull where his influence alarmed the orthodox and led to the formation of a small Independent church in May 1643. An unfriendly witness declared that after his return Nye &#145;lived a great part of his time &hellip; in Noblemen's families&#146;  (Edwards, 217) where he cultivated useful connections. By April 1642 the earl of Manchester, Warwick's son-in-law, had presented him to the living of Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire; in that month Nye was chosen as one of the county's two representatives to the Westminster assembly.<h2>
<a name="ReligiouspoliticsinLondon16431659"></a>Religious politics in London, 1643&#150;1659</h2>Henceforth Nye's career centred on London and national religious politics. Until then he had preached little there, but according to Thomas Edwards he had &#145;acted the State-parasite and played the polititian the more, &hellip; dealing in private, under hand, and hand to hand with some men of note&#146;  (Edwards, 217). He quickly emerged as a powerful Independent leader. In 1643 he and the eminent presbyterian Stephen Marshall accompanied the parliamentary commissioners to Edinburgh to negotiate Scottish entry into the war; there he praised the solemn league and covenant as &#145;warranted by both human and divine story&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.963). Nevertheless he recognized English reservations, and in a letter to the Westminster assembly he and Marshall claimed the agreement had been drawn up with such &#145;warinesse &hellip; there might be no bogling at it&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter from Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Nye</span>, 1643, 2). On his return to London he presented the draft agreement to parliament on 25 September 1643. His speech before the reading of the covenant, together with Alexander Henderson's on the same occasion, was printed by order of parliament as <span class="italic">The Covenant with a Narrative of the Proceedings and Solemn Manner of Taking it</span> (London, 1643) and <span class="italic">Two Speeches Delivered before the Subscribing of the Covenant</span> (Edinburgh, 1643).<br>
<br>Although he strongly supported the solemn league and covenant, Nye stopped short of advocacy of a presbyterian system; instead his tone was moderate and he deplored the bitterness of debates over church government. Independents were alarmed, but he exerted his influence to abort their petition of protest. The royalists acknowledged his standing in late 1643 when they vainly attempted to lure him and Goodwin to their side with offers of toleration, preferment, and a royal chaplaincy for Nye. Nye, however, renewed his advocacy of the covenant with an exhortation read in the House of Commons on 9 February 1644, now emphasizing the &#145;righteousnesse&#146; of the Scots and the dangers from &#145;Popish and Prelatick Projectors&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Exhortation to the Taking of the Solemne League and Covenant</span>, 1644, 6).<br>
<br>In the Westminster assembly, Nye was a leader of the small band of Independent clergy whose disproportionate influence enabled them to obstruct the presbyterian programme and, Edmund Calamy complained, buy time for their party to gain ground in the army and parliament  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.9). In November 1643 London ministers petitioned the Westminster assembly against gathered churches, a breach of the agreement reached in 1641 that religious differences between allies would not be publicly aired. With the other leading &#145;Dissenting Brethren&#146; (Goodwin, Sidrach Simpson, Jeremiah Burroughes, and William Bridge, all returned &eacute;migr&eacute;s) Nye published <span class="italic">An Apologeticall Narration</span>. They made much of the moral authority bestowed by exile and stressed their clerical respectability in order to dissociate themselves from Brownists. They emphasized their Englishness, distinguishing themselves from churches abroad, including that of Scotland, and argued against rigidity and making &#145;present judgement and practice a binding law &hellip; for the future&#146;  (Goodwin and others, 10). Doctrine had been settled by &#145;the good old Non-conformists&#146;  (ibid., 4); instead they concentrated on their programme for church government, advocating autonomous, gathered congregations exempt from any external &#145;Presbyteriall&#146; authority to excommunicate either churches or individuals. To the dismay of the Scots they accepted civil authority over the church, and in 1644 Nye argued in the Westminster assembly for &#145;the inconsistency of a presbytery with a civil state&#146;  (Tolmie, 96). Although his speech to parliament on his return from Scotland in 1643 was reprinted in January 1646 as <span class="italic">The Excellency and Lawfulnesse of the Solemne League</span>, his Independent credentials remained untarnished, perhaps in part because of the work's moderate tone. In 1644 Nye and Goodwin in a preface to John Cotton's <span class="italic">The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven</span> defended the Independent &#145;<i>Middle-Way</i> &hellip; between &hellip; <i>Brownisme</i>, and the Presbyteriall-government&#146;  (&#145;To the reader&#146;, Cotton), and defended the autonomy of the individual church. They also struggled to delineate the respective powers of pastors, elders, and brethren of the gathered church.<br>
<br>Nye wrote the preface to the Westminster assembly's <span class="italic">Directory for the Publique Worship of God</span> and he preached, albeit infrequently (six times between 1643 and 1653), before parliament. He also preached a Sunday morning and a weekly lecture at St Margaret's, Westminster, and gave a termly lecture in Westminster Abbey. In 1643 parliament installed him in the rectory of Acton, Middlesex, on the ejection of the incumbent, Dr Daniel Featley. In 1646 Nye was a member of the committee for sending ministers into the northern parts of the kingdom, and in December 1647 he and Stephen Marshall accompanied the commissioners to the king on the Isle of Wight. He was also one of the &#145;pestilent <i>Firebrands</i> of <i>Sedition</i>&#146; dispatched to calm the restive army in the winter of 1647&#150;8  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Elenticus</span>, 12&#150;19 Jan 1648, 59).<br>
<br>At the debate in the general council of the army at Whitehall on 14 December 1648, on whether the power of the civil magistrate derived from God and could be exercised in matters of religion, Nye was allied with Henry Ireton against the radicals. He allowed extensive powers to the magistrate, for authority to act in a commonwealth did &#145;nott in the least lie in the Ministeriall power butt in the Legislative power&#146;. These powers were &#145;conveyed to him by the people&#146;; hence &#145;the thinges of our God&#146; that were &#145;of publique good and publique concernment&#146; were legitimate areas for magisterial action  (<span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 2.118&#150;19). If the magistrate lacked a positive right to determine and enforce true religion, he none the less had negative powers to act against false religion.<br>
<br>Nye protested in 1648 against a personal treaty with the king. Although he was said to object to Pride's Purge and the king's execution, Cromwell employed Nye in 1649 to negotiate with the London presbyterians and to try to persuade secluded members to return to parliament. He joined with presbyterians in 1651 in their vain intervention on behalf of Christopher Love, and again in 1652 in opposing Fifth Monarchist attacks on tithes and a national church. With John Owen and others he presented the <span class="italic">Humble Proposal</span> for a religious settlement to the Rump and later the Barebones parliaments. Their approach, favouring toleration for those who accepted the &#145;fundamentals&#146; of Christianity, met with Cromwell's approval, and Nye's career prospered under his regime. He was a member of the commissions appointed in 1654 to &#145;try&#146; candidates for livings and to eject the undesirable. Anthony Sadler's record of his own failed candidature, <span class="italic">Inquisitio Anglicana</span> (1654), reveals Nye's cross-examination as hectoring and inquisitorial, an impression not refuted by the defence published anonymously by Nye's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75543/', "John Nye")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20415/', "Nye, John")</script>], who served as his clerk. In 1655, against the wishes of the parishioners, Cromwell gave the living of St Bartholomew by the Exchange to Nye and his gathered church. The parishioners complained that they were now excluded, for both pulpit and pews had been taken over by &#145;strainge congregacons&#146;  (Shaw, 2.133). They withheld their tithes and the rancorous dispute continued until the Restoration.<br>
<br>Nye was prominent in the Savoy conference of 1658 and was one of the leaders who drafted its <span class="italic">Declaration of the Faith and Order</span> of English congregational churches (1659). He participated in efforts to reconcile Independents and presbyterians but was prepared to make few compromises. Richard Baxter recognized his &#145;very great power&#146; with the Independents but Nye rebuffed efforts to achieve agreement &#145;between the Honest and Moderate&#146; of both parties, remaining elusive and ultimately intransigent  (<span class="italic">Calendar</span>, 1.298&#150;9). He objected that Baxter's criterion for admission to church membership&#151;&#145;a credible profession of faith &amp; holinesse&#146;&#151;failed to meet the need for &#145;deeper discoverie&#146;, and he rejected any association based on a covenant regarding church practice, &#145;for hee said &hellip; hee was borne free &amp; why should hee come under bonds?&#146;  (ibid., 1.306). Owen's &#145;Pride, &amp; Mr. Philip Nye's Policie&#146;, said Baxter, &#145;increased the flame, &amp; kept open our wounds&#146;  (G. Nuttall, &#145;The MS of <i>Reliquiae Baxterianae</i>&#146;, <span class="italic">Journal of Ecclesiastical History</span>, 6, 1995, 78).<h2>
<a name="RestorationIndependencyandthecivilmagistrate"></a>Restoration Independency and the civil magistrate</h2>At the Restoration, Nye was initially excluded from clemency because he &#145;had acted so highly &hellip; against the king, and had been instrumental in bringing all things into confusion&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.964). In the end his life was spared on condition that he never again hold civil or ecclesiastical office. In May 1660 he signed an address to Charles II, and in the same year he published <span class="italic">Beames of Former Light</span> (1660) in which, although he argued against using the threat of ejection to enforce conformity, he still acknowledged the magistrate's powers in religion. He later fruitlessly urged Baxter to join him in &#145;owning&#146; the king's proposed declaration of indulgence. He remained, however, an object of mistrust and he was accused of corruption and abuse of power as a trier. In 1662, in his only personal statement, he defended himself in a brief pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Case of Philip Nye, Minister, Humbly Tendered to the Consideration of the Parliament</span> and appealed for sympathy: he had been a preacher for forty years, was now infirm and dependent on voluntary contributions, and had a wife and three children (all in fact now adult) to provide for.<br>
<br>In 1662 Nye published <span class="italic">The Lawfulness of the Oath of Supremacy</span>, which argued for the king's power in ecclesiastical affairs and reiterated his earlier views on the legitimate powers of the civil magistrate to protect &#145;a gospel-Ministry&#146; and regulate the practice of religion  (<span class="italic">Lawfulness</span>, 1683, 25). The work revealed both caution in the face of restored monarchy and the alarm induced in an orderly and authoritarian cleric by interregnum radicalism and &#145;unseemly&#146; religious proceedings  (<span class="italic">Beames</span>, 4). He denied coercive power to the clergy but allowed it to the civil power. Outward conformity, he now said, was a means to &#145;restrain our inbred corruption&#146; and while it could not save it could &#145;work preparatively to Conversion&#146;. Christ's presence in men's souls was made manifest in their outward behaviour: politeness, civility, and &#145;Civil Relations&#146; had become signs of godliness  (<span class="italic">Lawfulness</span>, 25&#150;8).<br>
<br>Posthumously published works apparently dating from this period of Nye's &#145;unhappy leisure&#146; similarly accommodated the Independent position to changed political circumstances. He argued that church members might legitimately hear the sermons of ministers of the established church and, in a work diplomatically dedicated to James II by Nye's son Henry in 1687, he asserted the king's right to dispense with penal laws in religion. He was also reported to have written &#145;a compleat history of the old Puritan Dissenters&#146; which burned in the fire of London in 1666  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.97). Nye returned to London after the fire. In 1669 he was a lecturer in the Hackney combination, and in April 1672 he was licensed to preach in an Independent church in which he served as &#145;doctor&#146; and John Loder as pastor. He died at Brompton in September 1672 and was buried on 27 September at St Michael Cornhill.<h2>
<a name="Nyeandhiscontemporaries"></a>Nye and his contemporaries</h2>In an age of vivid clerical personalities Nye's remains elusive. The works published in his lifetime were largely co-operative and programmatic; those few of his sermons that found their way into print had a specific political purpose. His long-standing partnerships, notably with Goodwin and Marshall&#151;whose daughter married his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20415/', "John Nye (bap. 1620, d. 1686?)")</script>&#151;and his rapid emergence as an influential figure in religious politics indicate force of intellect and personality as well as political skill, yet the absence of affectionate or admiring tributes is notable. Instead assessments ranged from wary to hostile. Baxter thought Nye able but deplored the exclusive rigour of his Christianity, noting that at Acton he admitted so few to the communion that this &#145;rigour made the People think hardly of [him]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, ed. M. Sylvester, 1696, 3.46). Calamy praised Nye's thorough knowledge of &#145;the Disciplinarian controversy&#146;, and Nye had the reputation &#145;of a man of uncommon depth, who was seldom or never outreached, but &hellip; was of too warm a spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.96&#150;7).<br>
<br>Nye's enemies said that he grew rich through greed and corruption. Wood claimed that parliament gave him &pound;500 after his expedition to the king at Carisbrooke Castle, and a living worth &pound;400 per annum. He certainly had 4<i>s</i>. a day for expenses as a member of the Westminster assembly, and &pound;120 per annum for his lectureships at St Margaret's, Westminster, and the abbey. There were presumably other similar payments, and when bishops' lands were sold in 1651 Nye bought land in Yorkshire and, with a partner, a manor in Somerset for &pound;722. On the other hand, he paid rent for the house assigned to him in Westminster; some grants were contingent on raising money from designated sources (sometimes problematic); and his income from lecturing appears to have been significantly less than that of a star preacher such as Marshall.<br>
<br>Nye was &#145;a great politician&#146;  (D. Neal, <span class="italic">The History of the Puritans</span>, 5 vols., 1822, 4.416) who was disliked for his &#145;policie and subtility&#146;  (Edwards, 242); he was one of the &#145;two politic pulpit-drivers of Independency&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 2.75n.a). He was clearly a skilled political manager whose belief in the legitimate power of the civil magistrate facilitated flexibility in changed secular circumstances, while at the same time he remained intransigent in those religious matters that absorbed his attention, namely the government and organization of gathered churches. He was a libertarian in his demands for the unfettered autonomy of each church, but he was not a democrat. Authority in the church lay in the elders, a few &#145;select persons&#146; (never women, excluded from power by &#145;<i>Statute-law</i> of Christ&#146;), and in particular in the minister who alone had &#145;a Ministeriall Doctrinall authority&#146; over all its members &#145;<i>to instruct, rebuke</i>, [and] exhort with all authority&#146;  (Cotton). These views, joined with Nye's determination, religious inflexibility, and exclusiveness, help to explain the quarrels that marked his career and the reservations of more moderate and ecumenical colleagues. His surviving legacy was not in England but, through the influence of the <span class="italic">Declaration of Faith</span> of the Savoy conference, in the congregational churches of New England.<br>
