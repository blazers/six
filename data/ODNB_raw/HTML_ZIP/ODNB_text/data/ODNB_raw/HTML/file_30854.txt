<span class="headword">Broad, Sir  Charles Noel Frank</span>  (1882&#150;1976), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Lahore on 29 December 1882, the only child of Major Charles Herbert Broad, 5th fusiliers, and his wife, Ann Paul. He was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and Pembroke College, Cambridge, but did not take a degree. After serving in the South African War as a private in the militia he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1905. He went to the Staff College, Camberley, in 1914 and eventually went to France as a brigade major in the late summer of 1915. In the Somme campaign of 1916 he was chief staff officer (as a major) to General H. C. C. Uniacke, an outstanding gunner, who was major-general Royal Artillery in the Fifth Army. He was appointed to the DSO in 1917, and received the Croix de Guerre and L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In 1915 he married Lillian Mary, daughter of Edwin Mackintosh, who worked in shipping; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Broad's proven ability was recognized by his appointment as artillery instructor at the Staff College in 1919 where his students included four future chiefs of the Imperial General Staff. Four years later he transferred to the newly established Royal Tank Corps (RTC), and during the next decade he made his chief contribution to the profession as an exponent of mechanization and armoured warfare. Broad's talents were at once recognized by his appointment as commandant of the tank gunnery school at Lulworth, and in 1925 he succeeded another brilliant newcomer to the corps, George Mackintosh Lindsay, as chief instructor at the tank corps central school. Here he contributed to the first tactical manual for armoured forces and developed the medium tank, equipped with anti-tank gun and machine-guns and designed to fire on the move.<br>
<br>During the years 1927&#150;31, which witnessed the climax of British experiments with mechanized forces, Broad served in the staff duties section of the general staff at the War Office responsible for organizing for war. In 1929 he drafted what was to become a famous manual&#151;<span class="italic">Mechanised and Armoured Formations</span>&#151;popularly known in the army as the &#145;purple primer&#146; from the colour of its covers. Although progressive in tone, Broad's manual skilfully avoided the extremism and polemics which characterized much of the literature on mechanization. He stressed the superiority of armoured forces over infantry in power, mobility, and endurance; moreover he made the revolutionary suggestion that armoured forces might keep up advances of 30 to 50 miles a day for nearly a week&#151;a feat which was achieved by Germany's Panzer divisions in the early campaigns of the Second World War. General Heinz Guderian later acknowledged Broad's influence on his thinking, though it should be noted that the infantry component of the Panzer divisions was much stronger than Broad had recommended.<br>
<br>In 1931 Broad, now a brigadier, was given a wonderful opportunity to try out his ideas as commander of the experimental 1st brigade RTC. According to the expert on tank warfare Basil Liddell Hart those trials on Salisbury Plain were &#145;the most influential tactical experiments in the British Army since Sir John Moore's training of the Light Brigade at Shorncliffe Camp&#146;  (Liddell Hart, 1.179) during the Napoleonic wars. Broad demonstrated that his units, composed of medium and light tanks, could play a more adventurous role than close co-operation with slow-moving infantry. He proved that tank formations could be controlled while manoeuvring over difficult terrain by a combination of flags and radio telephony. These trials lent support to the proposition that only mechanized armoured forces could be manoeuvred under the intense fire to be expected on the modern battlefield. Unfortunately Broad's &#145;five year plan&#146; for the creation of four permanent armoured brigades was shelved owing to the financial crisis and the resignation of the Labour government in 1931. The momentum generated by Broad and his colleagues such as Lindsay, Sir F. A. Pile, and P. C. S. Hobart was lost, and six years elapsed before mechanization began in earnest in 1937.<br>
<br>This proved to be Broad's last direct connection with mechanization, though he remained deeply interested in the subject for the rest of his life. He became major-general in 1936. In 1937 he made an excellent impression on the new secretary of state for war, Leslie Hore-Belisha, but was given only the dead-end job of major-general in charge of administration at Aldershot. Since the main duty there was to organize the annual tattoo this was a scandalous waste of expertise. Whether there was an actual conspiracy at the War Office against Broad and the other tank pioneers is uncertain; but there was evidently a feeling in the military hierarchy that they should not be conspicuously rewarded in competition with sound but conservative officers of equivalent rank. Broad had not helped his prospects by a contretemps with the chief of the Imperial General Staff, Viscount Gort  (Liddell Hart, 2.35).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Broad was promoted to the Aldershot command, and in the following year he was made lieutenant-general and general officer commanding-in-chief, Eastern army, India, where he worked hard to modernize the Indian army under the threat of a Japanese invasion. He was appointed CB in 1938 and KCB in 1941 and retired in the following year on reaching retirement age, though he continued to be colonel commandant of the RTC until 1948. Broad's first wife died in 1942, and in 1944 he married Diana Myrtle, younger daughter of Colonel Philip Robert Bald, of Barton Lodge, Cerne Abbas; they had three sons (one deceased) and one daughter.<br>
<br>Slight of stature and generally mild of manner, Broad occasionally showed impatience with slower-minded senior officers. Several of his peers rated him an outstanding officer but one also mentioned his occasional want of tact. Perhaps it was this flaw which caused his estrangement from Gort over a trivial misunderstanding. Broad was sometimes depressed by the lack of funds for new equipment and realistic training, and also felt that the army was bedevilled by cliques. In later years he was apt to reproach himself for lacking the crusading zeal of a Joan of Arc, but it is hard to see that he could have made more of his brief opportunities in comparatively junior positions. Indeed his reputation is assured as a shrewd and balanced theoretician of armoured warfare in the years when Britain led the world in its tank manuals and field exercises. Broad died at Beaminster, Dorset, on 23 March 1976.<br>
