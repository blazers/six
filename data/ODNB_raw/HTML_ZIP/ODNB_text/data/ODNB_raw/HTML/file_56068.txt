<span class="headword">Nevill,  Wilfred Percy</span>  (1894&#150;1916), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 14 July 1894 at 15 Canonbury Park, North Islington, London, a younger son&#151;among nine children of whom seven survived childhood&#151;of Thomas George Nevill (1852&#150;1903), coal merchant (of George Nevill &amp; Son, Hoxton) and managing director of Kelly's Directories, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1856&#150;<i>c</i>.1948). The family was affluent, and staunchly Anglican. Following T. G. Nevill's death they moved to Tennyson's House, Montpelier Road, Twickenham, Middlesex. Nevill, called Billie or Bill by his family, from 1902 to 1908 attended Penrhyn Lodge, Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, a small &#145;dame preparatory school&#146;, where he became captain of the school, gained cricket, football, and hockey colours, topped the bowling averages, and won the shooting prize. From 1908 to 1913 at Dover College, a small Victorian public school, he was notably successful at games: he played in the first fifteen, the first eleven&#151;as captain in 1913, and scoring 107 not out against 6th flotilla, RN&#151;and the first hockey eleven, and was a member of the school running team. In 1913 he was head prefect and head of School House. He was a sergeant in the Officers' Training Corps, active in the debating society, and on the committee of the school branch of the Navy League. In October 1913 he was admitted a pensioner at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he read for the classics tripos, intending to become a schoolmaster. Jesus was then known as a sporting college, and he played hockey for it. He also enjoyed winter sports and London musicals and reviews.<br>
<br>In November 1914 Nevill was commissioned second lieutenant&#151;one of &#145;K's pups&#146;  (<span class="italic">Billie</span>, 72)&#151;in the 8th battalion of the East Surrey regiment, whose depot was at Kingston, a few miles from his home. The 8th was a service battalion, a Kitchener's New Army unit, and was in the 18th (eastern) division commanded by Major-General F. I. Maxse. After a month's course at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in December 1914, Nevill trained with his battalion in England, was promoted lieutenant (dated from 11 April 1915), and went to France with the battalion in July 1915. From August he served in the trenches, and in September he was promoted captain (backdated to 11 April 1915). He liked army life and applied for a regular commission. In November 1915 he was appointed a regular second lieutenant in the East Yorkshire regiment&#151;he wrote, &#145;Never heard of 'em before. I'm trying to get transferred to 1st E.S.R.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Billie</span>, 73)&#151;though he continued to serve in the 8th East Surreys with the temporary rank of captain. He hoped after the war to serve in India. He wrote letters home to his family: in them he appears cheerful, jaunty, and confident of ultimate British victory. Concerned about inadequate religious provision&#151;he wrote home in April 1916, &#145;it's disgraceful how few services we get out here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Billie</span>, 174)&#151;he held services for his unit. He may have been informally engaged to his sweetheart, Alice (Muffie or Muff) Schooling (<i>b</i>. 7 June 1898), who had been his next-door neighbour in Twickenham until her family moved to Hastings: her family assumed that the couple would have married had Nevill survived.<br>
<br>The 18th division was part of the Fourth Army, commanded by General Sir Henry Rawlinson, which in 1916 was to attack the German lines at the Somme. On leave in England in May Nevill bought footballs for his company to dribble across no man's land in the offensive: he hoped that it would help their advance. There had been similar uses of footballs previously, but it is not known whether he had heard of them. At 7.27 a.m. on Saturday 1 July 1916, the first day of the battle of the Somme, Nevill went over the parapet, kicking off his football, and led his company across no man's land towards the German lines and Montauban. He was shot in the head and killed, just outside the German wire. He was buried in Carnoy military cemetery, Somme.<br>
<br>Nevill was one of over 19,000 British killed that day: available statistics indicate that the most vulnerable rank was captain. Nearly 1000 officers were killed, and of these very few gained individual recognition from the wider public. However, Captain Nevill and his footballs were featured in the local and national press: the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> published a dramatic drawing by Richard Caton Woodville, &#145;The Surreys Play the Game!&#146;, and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> published a verse, &#145;The Game&#146;. Nevill's deed was commemorated by his regiment, and the story was subsequently retold in successive accounts of the Somme. His letters home were preserved by his family, and were later edited as <span class="italic">Billie: the Nevill Letters, 1914&#150;1916</span> (1991) by Ruth Elwin Harris. Nevill is commemorated, with other men from east Twickenham, on the war memorial in St Stephen's Church, near his family home.<br>
