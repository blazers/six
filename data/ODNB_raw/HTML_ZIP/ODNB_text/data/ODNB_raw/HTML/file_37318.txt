<span class="headword">Cox,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1776&#150;1845), <span class="occ">gardener</span>, is a figure about whose early life little is known. His first career as a brewer in Bermondsey came to an end when he retired about 1820 to a house then called Lawn Cottage (later Colnbrook Lawn), in Colnbrook, near Slough, Buckinghamshire. A 2 acre garden surrounded the house, and here Cox devoted his time to horticultural experiments, among them the one that produced the apple bearing his name, Cox's orange pippin. Two pips of a Ribston pippin, sown in a pot about 1830, grew into seedlings of two new and promising varieties, Cox's pomona and Cox's orange pippin, though the second soon eclipsed the first to become the most popular English dessert apple. The original tree survived until 1911, when it was blown down in a storm.<br>
<br>In 1836 grafts of both of Cox's new apple trees were given to E. Small &amp; Son, nurserymen of Colnbrook, who began to sell young trees locally four years later. About 1850 trees of the orange pippin were given a wider distribution by Charles Turner, of the Royal Nurseries, Slough, and the fruit soon began to attract attention. Thomas Ingram, Queen Victoria's head gardener at Frogmore and Windsor, showed the apple to a meeting of the British Pomological Society in December 1856, when it was acclaimed as one of the best kinds for the table, &#145;sweet, aromatic and very tender, a fair sized and handsome fruit&#146;. At the Grand Fruit Exhibition of the Horticultural Society on 24 October 1857, &#145;Cox's Orange Pippin, a medium-sized, warm-looking, brownish-red variety with a yellow crisp flesh of most exquisite flavour&#146;, won first prize  (Simmonds, <span class="italic">A Horticultural Who Was Who</span>, 14). After that its popularity spread so rapidly that by 1883, the year of the National Apple Congress held at the society's garden in Chiswick, 183 out of 231 exhibitors included it among the varieties they showed. In spite of its brilliant career, the society's delay in giving it an award of merit and a first-class certificate indicates unusual prudence, for &#145;the Ch&acirc;teau Yquem of apples&#146;, as E. A. Bunyard described it in 1929, did not receive these confirmations of its quality until 1962. Bunyard's accolade referred to a perfectly ripe Cox, left on its tree until October and not snatched off before it is anywhere near maturity, as so many commercially grown apples were later treated. The tree bearing Cox's orange pippin is vigorous enough to be a favourite for orchards in Britain and several other countries with a similar climate, and it has also been used as a parent in breeding a number of other varieties which share some of its desirable characteristics.<br>
<br>Richard Cox did not live long enough to see the triumph of his apple, for he died in Colnbrook on 20 May 1845, eight years after his wife, Ann. Both were buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Harmondsworth. There was no mention of any children in his will.<br>
