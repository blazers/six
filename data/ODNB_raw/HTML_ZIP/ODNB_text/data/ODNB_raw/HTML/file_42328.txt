<span class="headword">Baird,  John</span>  (1788&#150;1820), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was, with <a name="cosubject_42329"></a><span class="headword">Andrew Hardie</span>  (1792&#150;1820)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_64455"></a><span class="headword">James Wilson</span>  (1757&#150;1820)<span class="occ"></span>, one of the three &#145;Radical Martyrs&#146; executed for their part in the Scottish insurrection of April 1820. Baird, born in Condorrat, Stirling, was the third son of a Condorrat weaver named James Baird (<i>b</i>. 1740) and Isobel Edmond. He had two brothers and two sisters. Baird joined the 2nd battalion of 95th regiment of foot (the Rifle brigade) on 13 September 1806 in Glasgow. Promoted to bugler, he went with his battalion in the expeditionary force commanded by General Whitelock to attack Napoleon's Spanish allies in Buenos Aires. His battalion was based at Colonia, in Uruguay. He returned on the transport <i>Osborne</i>, on which he became ill. Having recovered, he went with the 95th to Spain and saw action during the Peninsular campaign under Wellington. By 1812 he was stationed at Getafe outside Madrid. On 15 March 1813 Baird returned to Glasgow on furlough. He was due to report back to his unit on 22 May but obtained a certificate from the district surgeon, Glasgow, stating that he was ill. On 22 June 1813 he was posted as a deserter. There is no record that the army was able to arrest him. Like many others at this period he simply disappeared.<br>
<br>Baird eventually returned to Condorrat and joined his father and brothers in the weaving trade. He could read and write very well, began to devour radical literature, and joined his local circulating library, becoming a radical reformer seeking the universal franchise, annual parliaments, and the repeal of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> with England of 1707. He became a prominent figure among the Condorrat radicals.<br>
<br>Many Scottish radical leaders saw armed insurrection as the only way to achieve their ends. Conditions were right as the post-war depression and unemployment created great unrest in the industrial south of Scotland, particularly among weavers. Government agents, however, were at work among the radical leadership. John King of Anderston, sometimes calling himself John Andrews, appeared to be their chief agent. The Glasgow police commander, James Mitchell, reported to home secretary Lord Sidmouth in March 1820 that the radicals were preparing a general rising in Scotland. A few days later, on King's advice, Mitchell arrested the entire 28-man radical central committee in Gallowgate. He then wrote to Lord Sidmouth suggesting that the agents provocateurs take over and issue a call to the rank and file for the rising on, significantly, 1 April 1820 (All Fools' day). The idea, explained Mitchell, was &#145;to catch them abroad and undefended&#146; so that the troops in Scotland could &#145;quench all thoughts of [Scottish] patriotic pride and Radical feeling among the disaffected&#146;  (Ellis and Mac a' Ghobhainn, 1989, 140). The &#145;Proclamation of the provisional government&#146; (the authorship of which is clearly English) was duly issued  (ibid., plate opposite p. 96). Some armed radicals answered the call, to be immediately arrested by the military.<br>
<br>On the evening of 4 April at about 11 p.m. King, the agent, had arrived at the house of John Baird's brother, Robert (baptized 8 April 1787 at Stirling), and his wife, where John Baird was lodging. Baird had been elected commander of the Condorrat insurgents. King told him that he had &#145;orders from the central committee&#146;. Baird was to take his men and join with a larger contingent in an attack on the Carron Iron Works near Falkirk, which was the largest single ironworks in Europe, employing 2000 men and supplying all the main artillery pieces to both navy and army. There was, in fact, no larger contingent on the way, and a company of the 80th regiment were at the works waiting for the hapless radicals.<br>
<br>At 5 a.m. Baird was joined by Andrew Hardie with twenty-five men who had marched up from Glasgow on King's instructions. Baird and his ten men combined forces with them under his command. They set off towards the Glasgow and Edinburgh Canal. King was never seen again after this. Baird split his forces in case he missed the supposed main force, and he and Hardie took separate routes to a point about a mile and a half beyond Bonnybridge village. Here they rejoined forces.<br>
<br>A troop of the 10th hussars, commanded by Lieutenant Ellis Hodgson, and the Kilsyth troop of the Stirlingshire yeomanry, commanded by Lieutenant John James Davidson, a tory lawyer from Edinburgh, were converging on their position. Baird's men were resting on a hill in the area known as Bonnymuir. Hodgson and the 10th hussars led a sabre charge against them. Baird instructed his men to take defensive positions. Hardie wrote:<blockquote>Mr Baird defended himself in a most gallant manner; after discharging his piece he presented it at the officer [Hodgson] empty, and told him he would do for him if he did not stand off. The officer presented his pistol at him, but it flashed and did not go off. Mr Baird then took the butt end of his piece and struck a private on the left thigh, where upon the sergeant of Hussars [Sergeant Saxelby] fired at him. Baird then threw his musket from him and seized a pike, and while the sergeant was in the act of drawing his sword, wounded him in the right arm. (Ellis and Mac a' Ghobhainn, 1970, 172&#150;3)</blockquote>But with the reinforcement of yeomanry troops under Davidson, Hodgson called on the insurgents to surrender, and Baird, seeing the futility of a prolonged struggle, agreed. Several of the insurgents were sabred by yeomanry troops after their surrender. Significantly enough, Hodgson already knew the name of the insurgent's leader. King had done his work well.<br>
<br>The wounded were placed on a cart and the prisoners marched to Stirling Castle, where Baird told the commander, Major W. Preddie: &#145;Sir, if there is to be any severity exercised towards us, let it be on me. I am their leader, and have caused them being here. I hope that I alone may suffer&#146;  (Ellis and Mac a' Ghobhainn, 315). Preddie observed: &#145;Throughout he [Baird] never shrunk from the position he assumed&#146;  (ibid., 176). Baird wrote several letters from prison and appeared to have developed a friendship with Miss Isobella Condy of Stirling, who had nursed some of the prisoners.<br>
<br>The unrest was over within a week and numerous other radicals were arrested elsewhere in Scotland. There were to be eighty-eight charged with high treason. The trials started in July. To ensure convictions the lord president of the court of sessions, Charles Hope, accepted that all trials would be held under English law and not under Scottish law, contrary to the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1707. Sir William Rae, the lord advocate, prosecuted with the aid of a leading English lawyer, Mr Serjeant Hullock, who advised on English law. The trial of Baird and Hardie, with the Bonnymuir prisoners, began on 13 July at Stirling. Francis Jeffrey (1773&#150;1850) led for the defence.<br>
<br>Baird was convicted on two of the four counts of high treason charged against him. On 4 August Baird, Hardie, and twenty others were sentenced to death. The twenty others had their sentences commuted, and a total of twenty-two were transported to the penal colonies for life. Throughout Scotland the other trials resulted in only one other death sentence. This was on 63-year-old James Wilson, a <span class="occ">weaver</span> of Strathaven.<br>
<br>On Friday 8 September 1820 Baird and Hardie were led to a public execution platform at Stirling Castle in front of a crowd of several thousand. Before his execution Baird told the crowd: &#145;What I have hitherto done, and which brought me here, was for the cause of truth and justice&#146;  (Ellis and Mac a' Ghobhainn, 279). The sympathy of the crowd caused the officer commanding to order his troops to present arms and a panic ensued. Sheriff Ranald MacDonald of Staffa refused to let the speeches continue. Both Baird and Hardie were hanged, their bodies cut down after half an hour, and their heads severed and held up with the cry: &#145;Behold the head of a traitor!&#146;<br>
<br>When details of how the insurrection had been initiated by government spies and agents provocateurs were revealed by Peter Mackenzie in his <span class="italic">An Exposure of the Spy System Pursued in Glasgow</span> (1832) a protest movement forced the whig government of 1835 to ask William IV to grant absolute pardons to all the 1820 insurgents who had been transported for life. It was not until 1847 that the bodies of Baird and Hardie were exhumed from Stirling Castle and placed in Sighthill cemetery, Glasgow. Wilson was commemorated in his native Strathaven.<br>
