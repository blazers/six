<span class="headword">Hog,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1736?), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and religious controversialist</span>, was the son of Thomas Hog (1625&#150;1680/81), minister of Larbert, Stirlingshire, and Marjory Murray of Philiphaugh (<i>d</i>. in or before 1693). Distinguished as a pious and thoughtful youth, with a particular gift for languages, philosophy, and theology, he graduated MA from Edinburgh University in 1677. However, the persecution suffered by his father (deprived in 1662 and outlawed in 1675), and by other covenanter ministers who refused to accept the declarations of indulgence, compelled him to cut short his studies and to seek refuge in the Netherlands. Once there he enrolled in Utrecht University to study divinity, and supported himself by offering private tuition to two young noblemen from The Hague. Although pressed by his friends to take up a ministry in the Reformed church there he declined on account of his inability to accept the doctrines of that church in their entirety. At the request of his mother he returned to Scotland after the revolution of 1688&#150;9, and was licensed by the presbytery of Edinburgh before being ordained as the minister of Dalserf, Lanarkshire, on 20 January 1691.<br>
<br>Hog soon became disillusioned with the course charted by the Scottish church, particularly in its willing acceptance of interference from temporal powers, and came to believe passionately that it had squandered the golden opportunities offered to it by the revolution. Consequently, even though he continued to support the person and the political legitimacy of William III, his conscience would not permit him to take the oath of allegiance in 1693. Elected as a member of the assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1695 he again refused to take the necessary oaths and returned home, having secured a certificate of attendance from that body even though he had never actually been permitted to take his seat. His criticisms of Erastian encroachments, the role of curates, and the failure of the church sufficiently to acknowledge the centrality of the covenant led to a rapid deterioration in his relationship with his parishioners and the elders of the presbytery of Hamilton. As a result he pleaded ill health and chose to demit his office on 30 March 1697.<br>
<br>Hog did, however, respond to a timely call from Carnock parish, in Dunfermline, and was admitted as minister there on 23 August 1699. In 1711 he stood as an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of divinity at Marischal College, Aberdeen. The rest of his career was devoted to writing and publishing tracts in order to defend and propagate his personal vision of a church loyal to the covenanter traditions of the previous generation. In particular he attacked the terms of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, the implementation of the abjuration oath, and the attempts to restore lay patronage to the church during the reign of Queen Anne. However, it was his discovery&#151;&#145;by a merciful and most unexpected disclosure of providence&#146;&#151;of Edward Fisher's <span class="italic">Marrow of Modern Divinity</span> (1645) that reignited doctrinal controversy within the kirk and sparked fresh calls for separation from it  (Fisher, 1789, xii). In 1718 Hog played an instrumental role in the republication of the work, which had &#145;been traversing the World since the Days of Oliver Cromwell&#146;, and contributed a fresh preface to it (<span class="italic">Snake in the Grass</span>, iii; Fisher, 1789, xii&#150;xiii). This new edition of the <span class="italic">Marrow</span> was intended to refute the general assembly's decision, in 1717, that it was no longer sound &#145;to teach that men must forsake sin in order to come to Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of the Rev. Robert Wodrow</span>, 1.24), and also in order to combat the perceived growth of Arminian practices within the Church of Scotland. Its impact was immediate and its growing popularity, among the laity, came to be seen as a threat to the authority of the hierarchy of the church. As a consequence, the <span class="italic">Marrow</span> was condemned, on 20 May 1720, by an act of the assembly of the Church of Scotland, which ordered ministers to forbid members of their congregations from reading it, on account of its reputed antinomian errors. Enraged, Hog was one of the twelve clergymen&#151;subsequently dubbed the &#145;Marrow men&#146; by their detractors&#151;who launched a vigorous protest against the decision. As an extremely prolific writer and polemicist he poured forth a stream of books and pamphlets that sought to explain passages in that work and to vindicate its leading tenets (<span class="italic">A Letter to a Gentleman</span>, 1719; <span class="italic">Cromwellian Ghost Conjur'd</span>, 1720; <span class="italic">A letter wherein the scriptural grounds &hellip; for the reformation of the churches &hellip; are succinctly considered</span>, 1717; <span class="italic">Twelve Queries</span>, 1812). As a result he not only rendered himself &#145;most obnoxious to the ecclesiastical leaders of the day&#146;, but also contributed indirectly to the secession of several ministers from the church in 1733  (Fraser, 125). His health failed in 1729, and he probably died in Edinburgh in 1736. He had married, and had two daughters, Alison and Janet, both of whom married ministers in the Church of Scotland. Powerful and solemn in his manner of speech and preaching, his Scottish accent was roughly overlaid with Dutch as the result of his early years spent in exile. He was eulogized in verse by his friend the Revd Ralph Erskine as a<blockquote>
<div class="indent">venerable sage<br>
</div>
<div>the humble witness 'gainst the haughty age<br>
</div>
</blockquote>&#151;on account of his thorough opposition to deism.<br>
