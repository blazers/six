<span class="headword">Cammaerts,  Francis Charles Albert</span>  (1916&#150;2006), <span class="occ">special operations officer and teacher</span>, was born on 19 June 1916 at 17 Launceston Place, South Kensington, London, the elder son and third of the six children of Emile Leon Cammaerts (1878&#150;1953) and his wife, Helen Geralda Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Braun (1879&#150;1964), an actress with the stage name Tita Brand. His Belgian father was a journalist, a respected poet, and professor of Belgian studies at the University of London from 1933 to 1947. His wife, Cammaerts's mother, was the daughter of the Wagnerian diva Marie Brema. Cammaerts was brought up at Radlett, Hertfordshire, going to preparatory school in Harpenden followed by Mill Hill School and then St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he got a poor degree in English and history. He became a schoolteacher, first in Belfast and then in Penge in Kent. A pacifist from childhood, he resigned in 1940 and went to work as a farm labourer in Lincolnshire. On 15 March 1941, at the register office in Caistor, Lincolnshire, he married Nancy (Nan) Findlay (1916&#150;2001), daughter of James Smith Findlay, architect. They had a son and three daughters (one of whom died young).<br>
<br>Cammaerts's brother Pieter's death in the RAF cured him of pacifism. A chance meeting with Harry R&eacute;e, a friend and colleague from Penge, led him into the Special Operations Executive (SOE), where his perfect fluency in French commended him to the independent French section. He had one great disadvantage as a secret agent&#151;he stood six feet four inches tall, and thus caught policemen's eyes. Moreover, the training staff did not notice his qualities of leadership, and pronounced him no more than a competent instructor in sabotage. As such, ranked as a lieutenant in the intelligence corps but wearing plain clothes, he went to France by Lysander aircraft on the night of 23&#150;4 March 1943 to join the circuit of Peter Churchill, who returned by the same aircraft to England for rebriefing. Churchill's circuit had just moved from the riviera to Annecy, near the Swiss frontier. Cammaerts found it dangerously insecure, separated himself from it at once, and settled down in Nice to discover what life in Nazi-occupied France was like, pretending that he was recovering from tuberculosis.<br>
<br>With the help of some retired policemen Cammaerts gradually assembled a powerful circuit of his own, codenamed Jockey, in some of the d&eacute;partements to the east of the Rh&ocirc;ne, mainly in the Dr&ocirc;me. His own codename was Roger. With the help of Auguste Floiras, his radio operator, he was able to secure parachuted drops of supplies, and so to arm the saboteurs he trained. In parallel with his sabotage circuits he had a private circuit of safe houses round which he rotated, never staying more than two nights in any one place; nobody else, not even Floiras, knew where he would be&#151;an invaluable safety precaution. He carried the papers of an electricity inspector, which enabled him to travel widely. In the spring of 1944&#151;by now a lieutenant-colonel&#151;he effected some useful sabotage, both of railways and of electric power supplies. He redoubled his efforts after the allied landings in Normandy in June 1944. He visited the Vercors during its rising, but escaped from it when the Germans attacked, with his courier, the Polish countess Krystyna Gizycka. The <i>&eacute;tat-major des forces fran&ccedil;aises de l'int&eacute;rieur</i> gave him command of all resistance forces east of the Rh&ocirc;ne, but no orders. The Germans offered two million francs for his capture; no one turned him in.<br>
<br>By bad luck Cammaerts fell into enemy hands at a road block on 13 August, was identified, and condemned to death. The night before he was to have been shot his courier appeared with a vast sum in francs and bought his release. His teams offered invaluable help to the American troops who landed on the riviera on 15 August and inflicted heavy casualties on the retreating Germans. He was awarded a DSO by the British, the Croix de Guerre and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by the French, and the medal of freedom by the Americans. He and Floiras rescued the latter's wife and daughter from Ravensbr&uuml;ck concentration camp.<br>
<br>After the war Cammaerts served briefly in the allied military government in Berlin, before being posted to Brussels&#151;where his family could join him&#151;as deputy director of the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency (1946&#150;8). He then spent four years running an international bureau for educational visits and exchanges, before he went back to teaching. He became headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School at the new town of Stevenage, which in nine years (1952&#150;61) he built up into a flourishing eight-hundred-strong comprehensive school. He then spent five years (1961&#150;6) as principal of Scraptoft teacher training college, Leicester, treating trainees as his equal, and instilling his theories of how children should be taught. He always stressed the importance of bringing out each child's individuality, rather than cramming them with data. Staff and pupils alike warmed to his outgoing personality. In 1966 he became professor of education in Nairobi, Kenya, as that former colony recovered from the ravages of Mau Mau, and assured Kenyan predominance over former missionary schools of several faiths. From 1972 to 1981 he was principal of Rolle College, Exmouth, again sustaining teacher training. His last official post was in Botswana, where from 1982 to 1988 he set up a teacher training system at Molepolole from scratch.<br>
<br>Cammaerts and his wife, Nan, retired to Combemaure in the Dr&ocirc;me, and then moved on to Le Pouget in the H&eacute;rault, where she died in 2001. He lived another five years, dying in his house at Le Pouget on 3 July 2006. He was survived by his son and two daughters. He often said he would rather be remembered as a teacher than as a secret agent.<br>
