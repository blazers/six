<span class="headword">Jaffa <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jaffe]</span>,  Max</span>  (1911&#150;1991), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born on 28 December 1911 at 25 Goodge Street, London, the son of Israel Jaffe, an immigrant Russian&#150;Jewish tailor then working as a butcher, and his London-born Russian wife, Millie Makoff (<i>d</i>. 1932). On his sixth birthday his father gave him a half-size violin, hoping the boy would later make money from the instrument. He studied for two years under a second-rate teacher, and was about to give up when he was taken to hear Jascha Heifetz's d&eacute;but, and changed his mind. He then took lessons from Wilhelm Sachse, and at the age of thirteen auditioned for the Guildhall School of Music, where his main teacher was Max Mossel. To supplement his scholarship he played in orchestras at Lyons tea houses and as an accompanist to silent films in cinemas, and formed a trio which played in hotels; later he led the orchestras at the Trocadero and Piccadilly hotels, playing the light classics which were to become his stock-in-trade. He won several college prizes, and in October 1931 he graduated from the Guildhall with the gold medal and principal's prize.<br>
<br>Still only nineteen, Jaffa was appointed leader of the Scottish Orchestra (later the Scottish Symphony Orchestra) in November 1931, taking leave from the Piccadilly Hotel, but he did not enjoy the experience, and he returned to London in February 1932 to resume his career with the Piccadilly Salon Orchestra, before going freelance and playing at venues including the Caf&eacute; de Paris and Ciro's, and for film soundtracks. On 7 October 1934 he married Bessie Joseph (<i>b</i>. 1911/12); their daughter, Elizabeth, was born in January 1936, but the couple lived almost separate lives.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Jaffa served in the Royal Artillery, then as a pilot in the RAF, and later in the Air Transport Auxiliary. He hardly touched the violin during the war, and after demobilization in November 1945 had practically to relearn it with the help of his last teacher, Sasha Lasserson. He joined the Mantovani Orchestra, at the back desk (though he eventually became its leader), was the violin soloist on its bestseller <span class="italic">Charmaine</span> (1951), and made regular broadcasts with the orchestra for the BBC. In 1948 he bought a Pietro Guarnerius violin of 1704, which became his favourite instrument. He also played with the BBC London Studio Players and occasionally stepped in to the Albert Sandler Trio when Sandler was ill. After Sandler's death in 1948, Jaffa took his place (with the cellist Reginald Kilbey and the pianist Jack Byfield), and the Max Jaffa Trio toured the country, making their first television appearance in 1954. From May 1956 they were regulars on <span class="italic">Music at Ten</span>, where their lack of scores and scripts lent an air of easy informality to the show. They toured widely and played together until Jack Byfield's death in 1976. Also in 1956, Jaffa became soloist and leader of the BBC Palm Court Orchestra for the popular and long-running radio programme <span class="italic">Grand Hotel</span>. Jaffa was divorced from his first wife, and on 24 June 1959 he married the singer Jean Grayston 
    (real name Jean Sylvia Gluckstein, <i>b</i>. 1925/6)
  , whom he had met in 1956. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1960 Jaffa began his long association with Scarborough: for twenty-seven years he entertained holidaymakers there during a seventeen-week summer season of concerts given by his fifteen-piece Spa Orchestra. Consisting of light classical pieces, often including more substantial works, these concerts were given in the Grand Hall and broadcast by the BBC. Jaffa had a different programme each night for three weeks, and then repeated the concerts. He received the freedom of the borough of Scarborough in 1986, when, after a mix-up, he gave up the summer seasons. But he did not retire, making broadcasts on BBC Radio 2 while leading the Palm Court Orchestra at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, and toured Britain with a programme entitled &#145;Max Jaffa&#151;sixty years of music&#146;. During his last performing years he suffered from tinnitus, and he finally retired in 1990. He was appointed OBE in 1982 and was an honorary fellow of the Guildhall School of Music. He published <span class="italic">How to Play the Violin</span> (1986) and his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Life on the Fiddle</span> (1991), and made several recordings. Of short stature, always immaculately dressed, Jaffa was a friendly man much loved by his public, his colleagues, and his family. He died peacefully at his home, 31 Elm Tree Road, St John's Wood, London, on 30 July 1991; his second wife, Jean, survived him.<br>
