<span class="headword">Capetanakis,  Demetrios</span>  (1912&#150;1944), <span class="occ">poet and literary critic</span>, was born in Smyrna (now Izmir in Turkey) on 22 January 1912, the son of Apostolos Capetanakis, a medical doctor from Zagora in Pelion, who settled in Athens in 1922. Demetrios was educated at Athens University, where he studied political science and economics. In Greece he published several philosophical works, including <span class="italic"><i>Apo ton ag&#333;na ton psychik&#333;s monou</i></span> (&#145;The struggle of the solitary soul&#146;, 1934) and <span class="italic"><i>Mythologia tou &#333;raiou</i></span> (&#145;The mythology of beauty&#146;, 1937). He studied at Heidelberg University (1934&#150;6) under Karl Jaspers, where he obtained the degree of DPhil, writing a dissertation entitled <span class="italic">Liebe und Zeit</span> (&#145;Love and time&#146;). In Germany he came under the influence of the writings of the German poet Stefan George. He later rejected George's influence, saying in his essay on George that in his attitudes he &#145;was one of those who prepared the way for the Nazis&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">Demetrios Capetanakis</span>, 89).<br>
<br>In 1939, with a British Council scholarship, Capetanakis arrived in England, where he spent the remainder of his brief life. At Cambridge he was a pupil of Dadie Rylands at King's College. It was there that he met John Lehmann, the editor of <span class="italic">New Writing</span> and of <span class="italic">Penguin New Writing</span>, who became a close friend. While he said of Lehmann, &#145;away from you I am just nothing&#146;  (Wright, 129) and &#145;all I have created up to now was the work of both of us&#146;  (ibid., 128), it seems unlikely that he and Lehmann were lovers. Much of his writing appeared in Lehmann's periodicals, in the wartime evolution of which he was very active, contributing essays, poems, and translations of Greek poetry.<br>
<br>Capetanakis was fluent in French and German and had written in both languages. On his arrival in England he began to write in English. Capetanakis wrote major essays on Rimbaud, Dostoyevsky, and Proust, as well as briefer pieces on Thomas Gray and Horace Walpole, Charlotte Bront&euml;, &#145;A view of English poetry&#146;, and &#145;Notes on some contemporary writers&#146;. The ideas in these essays may well derive from his time with the existentialist Karl Jaspers: &#145;Silence is what surrounds our lives&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">Demetrios Capetanakis</span>, 136); &#145;It is only when we dare to face unreality, nothingness, that we become real&#146;  (ibid., 131).<br>
<br>It is in his dozen or so poems in English that Capetanakis shows himself to be remarkable&#151;not merely because they are written by someone who had studied English for only a few months before coming to England, but because of their power, directness, and economy. They are reminiscent of Emily Dickinson, whom Capetanakis was precocious in admiring. In his essay on Dostoyevsky he spoke of &#145;two kinds of writers: those whose world is protected by a hedge &hellip; and those whose world is not protected by anything against the powers of nothingness&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">Demetrios Capetanakis</span>, 104). His poems are clearly the work of a writer who does not see his world as &#145;protected&#146;. His poem &#145;Abel&#146; expresses starkly the ambiguous relation of victim and perpetrator that we have to evil:<blockquote>
<div>The ageless ambiguity of things<br>
</div>
<div>Which makes our life mean death, our love be hate.<br>
</div>
<div>My blood that streams across the bedroom sings:<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;I am my brother opening the gate!&#146;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Edith Sitwell, who championed Capetanakis's poetry, said of this poem that in it &#145;the central problem of humanity is finding words&#146;  (ibid., 38).<br>
<br>Capetanakis had a profound effect on those who knew him. William Plomer wrote:<blockquote>Of his physical presence the chief feature was his dark eyes, glowing with intelligence and feeling. He was slight in build and had delicate, nervous hands &hellip; the whole face was harmonious &hellip; it had a kind of radiance, an effect of luminosity. (Lehmann, <span class="italic">Demetrios Capetanakis</span>, 183)</blockquote>John Lehmann said, &#145;he entered into your mind and heart with an uncanny power of imaginative understanding&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">I am my Brother</span>, 119).<br>
<br>Capetanakis left Cambridge in 1941 to join the press office of the Greek embassy in London; but before that he showed signs of the leukaemia which eventually killed him, though it was not then correctly diagnosed. Shortly after arriving in London, he found himself in hospital; but he rallied sufficiently to continue his activities, and looked forward to a long period of literary work. By autumn 1942 he was ill again, and was sent to Devon to rest. In 1943 he was invited to the Cadbury's Manor Farm in Birmingham to assist in training members of the Friends' Ambulance Unit who would be working in Greece at its liberation. He returned to London, but his apparent recovery did not continue. He had fits of dizziness and was finally admitted to the Westminster Hospital in London, where he died on 9 March 1944.<br>
<br>Capetanakis's funeral was held at the Greek cathedral in Bayswater and he was interred in the Greek enclosure at Norwood cemetery. His passing was commemorated in a volume edited and published in 1947 by John Lehmann, <span class="italic">Demetrios Capetanakis: a Greek Poet in England</span>, bringing together his writings in English along with recollections by friends.<br>
