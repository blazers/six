<span class="headword">Semple,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1782), <span class="occ">architect and engineer</span>, claimed to have had modest origins&#151;&#145;my father &hellip; was a workman about the year 1675&#146;  (Semple, 79)&#151;and little formal education, but he seems to have been descended from a well-connected line of Ulster-Scottish clergymen. He served an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, and was admitted a freeman of Dublin in 1735. By 1743&#151;when transacting property business in Armagh&#151;he was describing himself as an architect. He had at least two brothers: Edward (<i>d</i>. 1787), who was apprenticed to him, became a plasterer and architect, while John (<i>d</i>. 1784), also a plasterer, turned to brick and stone contracting.<br>
<br>Semple must have been married by 1740, but his wife's name has not been traced. In 1754 he acquired a site on Queen Street in the Oxmantown area of Dublin, where he built a number of houses, including his own residence. Semple also built three houses on Capel Street: a pair for Dr Edward Leigh, constructed next to the old mansion of the Conolly family in 1751&#150;2, and another for Arthur Newburgh. Leigh was treasurer of St Patrick's Cathedral, where Semple designed and erected the 103 foot steeple in 1749. In the same year Semple built Newbridge, a country house at Donabate, co. Dublin, for the archbishop of Dublin, Charles Cobbe. His other country houses included Ramsfort, co. Wexford, for Colonel Abel Ram (1751; des. 1798) and Headfort, co. Meath, for the first earl of Bective (from 1760), a property which could boast interiors completed by Robert Adam in the 1770s. He also designed and built St Patrick's Hospital, Dublin (1749&#150;57), erected with a legacy of Dean Swift.<br>
<br>Semple's best-known work was Essex Bridge (1753&#150;5; replaced 1872&#150;5) across the Liffey, which although visually similar to Labelye's Westminster Bridge (1739&#150;50), was constructed by the coffer-dam method rather than the more usual caissons. The government awarded him &pound;500 for his services after he lodged a petition in 1761. Semple described and illustrated the project in his expansive <span class="italic">Treatise on Building in Water</span> (1776), which he later reissued in 1780 with an appended paper entitled &#145;Hibernia's free trade, or, A plan for the general improvement of Ireland&#146;. Throughout his career Semple attempted to interest public authorities in unsolicited projects, some stillborn examples of which he published. His proposal for a replacement for Ormonde Bridge in Dublin in 1776 was grounded on necessity, but other schemes were grandiose and impractical, such as the realignment of the mouth of the Liffey (1755), which he submitted to the ballast office in 1762, his plans for a &#145;spacious and commodious harbour for the Downs in England&#146;, and a system of 120 foot wide roads running the length and breadth of Ireland.<br>
<br>Semple died at Queen Street in April 1782. The principal beneficiaries of his estate were his daughter Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Keating, a member of a Clonmel brewing family, and her children. The architectural succession passed in time to John Semple's son John (1763&#150;1840), who started out as a bricklayer and builder, and grandson John (1801&#150;1882), who together as John Semple &amp; Son were architects to the board of first fruits for the province of Dublin (1824&#150;32), in which capacity they designed a number of quirky and inventive churches. John, a member of Dublin corporation, served as its unsalaried architect from 1823 to 1829, when he was succeeded by his son, who left office in 1832.<br>
