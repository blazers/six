<span class="headword">Squire,  Rose Elizabeth</span>  (1861&#150;1938), <span class="occ">factory inspector</span>, was born at 6 Orchard Street, Marylebone, London, on 19 May 1861, the youngest daughter of William Squire (1825&#150;1899), surgeon, and his wife, Martha Wilkinson. Her father had, as a medical student, administered ether at Robert Liston's first major operation under anaesthetic (1846); he later practised as a Harley Street physician and was known for his work on epidemiology and preventive medicine. Her elder brother, John Edward Squire (1855&#150;1917), also became a physician, and made the prevention and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis &#145;his life's work&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>, 4.506). As was common for the period, she was educated at home by a governess, &#145;came out&#146; into fashionable London society, and took up voluntary social work. By the age of thirty-two, however, she was unmarried and in need of an income.<br>
<br>Despite the campaigns of middle-class women to open up educational and professional employment opportunities, there were few respectable openings, and competition for them was fierce. At various stages in her career Squire expressed frustration at the unequal treatment of women in employment and politics. Her own predicament in the early 1890s was worsened by the fact that many middle-class girls had by then received a schooling and were potentially more employable than she was. It was her own choice to become a sanitary inspector and then a factory inspector. Neither occupation was widely regarded as suitable work for a woman, and her family and friends expressed disapproval and dismay.<br>
<br>In 1893 Squire began training with Lucy Deane under the auspices of the National Health Society to qualify as a lecturer on hygiene, nursing, and first aid. She also studied and undertook practical nursing, and took examinations for the society's diploma in anatomy, physiology, hygiene, nursing, and first aid. In November 1893 she began inspecting workshops and laundries in Kensington and then, in 1894, became the first woman to sit for the sanitary inspectors' certificate. At first the Local Government Board had been loath to recognize women as sanitary inspectors, but in the end it had to give way.<br>
<br>Squire had stood up to family and Local Government Board prejudice, but then found the work of sanitary inspector too limited and therefore frustrating. Problems were brought to her attention about which she could do nothing as they fell under the remit of the factory inspectors. She, moreover, became aware of the greater scope of factory inspectors. As the 1895 <span class="roman">Factory and Workshop Bill</span> passed through parliament she worked closely with the three women factory inspectors behind the scenes, feeding information to back-benchers. The contents of the bill related to her everyday work, and she found it irksome playing an indirect role in policy making when men ignorant of the facts played a direct role.<br>
<br>In December 1895 Squire was appointed a lady inspector of factories. All the women were at this time peripatetic inspectors, and Squire therefore gained experience of women's working conditions throughout the country. In 1903 she was promoted to senior lady inspector and in 1908 she moved with her sister to Manchester, where she was based for four and a half years. In 1912 she returned to London as deputy principal inspector.<br>
<br>From 1906 to 1907 Squire served as a special investigator to the royal commission on the poor laws, which brought her into contact with male workers for the first time. With Arthur Steel-Maitland, her fellow special investigator, she examined the relationship between industrial and sanitary conditions and pauperism. She discussed with Beatrice Webb, the member of the royal commission for whom she was working, not just the details of her own subject but the principles and problems of poor relief in general.<br>
<br>Factory inspection, although far closer to the heart of the policy-making process than sanitary inspection, also held frustrations for Squire, many of them to do with gender. She found it difficult working in a separate branch from the men inspectors when a hierarchy of men with vested interests in their positions and duties existed. Even after women ceased to be peripatetic, she still found it difficult; she commented on the galling sense of the limitations and isolation of the women's branch from the main current of Home Office practice and policy. She did, however, remark on the friendship and harmony with male colleagues in Manchester, which suggests that she did not encounter these experiences elsewhere.<br>
<br>During the war Squire, like other women inspectors, expanded the scope of her work. From 1915 she worked closely with the Ministry of Munitions, now responsible for the production of munitions and for maximizing munition workers' productivity, which included promoting health and safety at the workplace, low absenteeism rates, and low staff turnover. The recognition within the ministry, albeit slowly and partially, of the link between productivity and good working conditions led to her involvement in conferences at the ministry and a place on its Health of Munition Workers Committee. Early in 1918 she transferred from the Home Office to the ministry as director of the women's welfare department, which involved her developing new policies as well as supporting and instructing welfare officers. The war heightened interdepartmental rivalries, and her transfer helped to improve communications between an old and conservative department and a new ministry under less orthodox leadership. She was not keen on the temporary transfer, and although she did not subsequently regret it she did feel that it had militated against her promotion. In 1918 she was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>In 1919 Squire became director of women's training at the Ministry of Labour, which involved training former service personnel and munitions workers for peacetime work. In 1920 she returned to the Home Office as a principal, the first woman to hold an administrative post in the Home Office. At the Home Office she worked directly on the drafting of a new factory bill, but short-lived governments, employers' hostility, and Conservative home secretaries' sympathy for the employers' case in the 1920s meant that a new <span class="roman">Factory Act</span> was not passed until 1937, eleven years after her retirement.<br>
<br>On her retirement Squire immediately wrote her memoirs, <span class="italic">Thirty Years in the Public Service: an Industrial Retrospect</span> (1927) which reveal little of her motivations and personal thoughts, and even less of her private life. She died on 15 April 1938 at the home of her sister and brother-in-law at Wellmead, Fryerning, Ingatestone, Essex. Her funeral took place on 20 April 1938 at Ealing cemetery.<br>
