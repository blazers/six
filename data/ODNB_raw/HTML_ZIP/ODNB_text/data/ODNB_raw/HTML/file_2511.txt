<span class="headword">Blackburn,  William</span>  (1750&#150;1790), <span class="occ">surveyor and architect</span>, was born in Southwark, the son of a tradesman of St John's Horsleydown, probably the John Blackburn who on 15 November 1749 married Eleanor Howell of that parish. His mother, said to be a native of Spain, died in his infancy. Though apprenticed to a surveyor, Blackburn was essentially self-educated. In 1769 he competed for the Dublin royal exchange. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1772, and obtained a silver medal in 1773 for the best drawing of the interior of Wren's St Stephen Walbrook. In 1775 he exhibited drawings of minor buildings &#145;designed for a gentleman in Surrey&#146;.<br>
<br>Blackburn's great opportunity arose from the 1779 <span class="roman">Penitentiary Act</span>, which permitted imprisonment to replace transportation: solitary confinement was to induce remorse, and hard labour to provide correction. In 1782 he won the subsequent competition for a national male penitentiary house to accommodate 600, out of a field of sixty-three entries which included designs by John Soane, Thomas Hardwick, and Thomas Baldwin. It was he who &#145;first turned prison design into a kind of technology, translating the doctrine of reform into the practicalities of construction&#146;  (Evans, 118). Financial exigencies prevented the construction of his prize design (now lost), but the ideas embodied in the <span class="roman">Penitentiary Act</span> were extensively implemented by local authorities under the 1784 <span class="roman">Gaols Acts</span>; Blackburn secured many of their commissions and began &#145;to develop prison design into a kind of moral geography&#146;  (ibid., 142). By 1787 he was regarded as the leading authority in the country on prison design.<br>
<br>According to a report of 1826, the plan of Liverpool borough gaol (1786&#150;9; dem. 1855) resembled Blackburn's original proposal. The 1784 legislation required such local prisons to be divided into &#145;distinct apartments&#146; for various classes of prisoner, graded by sex and delinquency. Designed for 270 inmates&#151;huge by contemporary standards&#151;Liverpool gaol's six free-standing radial blocks were all externally visible from the gaoler's house at the hub. John Howard praised it when under construction: &#145;with a view to security, health, reformation and convenience, I apprehend, it will be one of the first borough gaols in the kingdom&#146;  (Howard, 206). Blackburn had in each of his prisons to resolve the problem of reconciling these prerequisites. To achieve security he established a patrollable zone between the cell blocks and the perimeter wall, itself designed so as to afford no internal foothold. He told Jeremy Bentham that his stone walls were too massive to break through, and undermining was blocked by a water trap. His radial plans, perhaps influenced by contemporary French circular forms, facilitated maintenance of order. Fragmentation of the structure facilitated the ventilation then regarded as essential to prevent &#145;gaol fever&#146;, typhus or typhoid; furthermore&#151;as in his Gloucester gaol and &#145;houses of correction&#146;&#151;the structure was punctured by air holes in walls, floors, and ceilings, the cell blocks being elevated on piers or arcades. His gaols were further characterized by a severe flat-roofed entrance lodge that provided a platform for executions. Blackburn was the originator of a type of architecture in which the formal traditional elements were &#145;sublimated to the requirements of reform&#146;  (Evans, 181). John Howard regarded Blackburn as the only man capable of delineating upon paper his ideas of what a prison ought to be.<br>
<br>In addition to executing or beginning gaols in Gloucestershire (the county gaol, 1788&#150;91, and four houses of correction, 1787&#150;91) and at Oxford (county gaol, <i>c</i>.1785, and city gaol, 1786&#150;9; dem. 1879), Liverpool (1786&#150;7; dem. 1855), Ipswich (1786&#150;90), Salford (New Bayley, 1787&#150;90; dem. <i>c</i>.1872), Preston (house of correction, 1789), Monmouth (1788&#150;90), Dorchester (1789&#150;95), Exeter (1789&#150;95; dem. 1853), Lewes (house of correction, 1789&#150;93; dem. 1967), Stafford (<i>c</i>.1789&#150;93), and Shrewsbury (1789&#150;93), Blackburn prepared designs for gaols at Bedford and Lancaster Castle. He is said to have planned the gaol at Limerick (<i>c</i>.1789), and designed improvements to the Dublin Newgate (dem. <i>c</i>.1880). For the Bristol Unitarians he designed the chapel at Lewin's Mead (1788&#150;91) and in September 1790 he surveyed the cathedral at Exeter. As surveyor to the Watermen's Company from 1776, he designed their hall in St Mary-at-Hill, London (1778&#150;80). Blackburn also designed houses both on his account and for others: a villa at Denmark Hill (1785&#150;6), &#145;perhaps the finest house&#146; in South Lambeth  (<span class="roman">Survey of London</span>, 146), provided a model for others close by. He worked consistently within the classical tradition, influenced by Robert Adam, employing such features as a rusticated ground floor, lunettes, and continuous sill-courses generally throughout his <i>&#339;uvre</i>. He was surveyor to St Thomas's Hospital and Guy's Hospital (alterations <i>c</i>.1788) in his native Southwark. His design for rebuilding Hackney church, Middlesex, was set aside by his death.<br>
<br>Corpulent in figure, medium in height, Presbyterian in religion, Blackburn was noted, according to an obituary, for his candour and modesty. He married a Quaker, Lydia, daughter of Joshua Hobson, a Southwark builder, on 2 February 1783 at St Olave's, Southwark. He died suddenly on 28 October 1790 at Preston, Lancashire, as he was on his way to Glasgow to discuss a proposal for a new prison there. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, London. His wife survived him with a son and two daughters; a second son was born posthumously. Blackburn owned leasehold and freehold property, and left his family in comfortable circumstances. His brother-in-law William Hobson completed several of his undertakings.<br>
