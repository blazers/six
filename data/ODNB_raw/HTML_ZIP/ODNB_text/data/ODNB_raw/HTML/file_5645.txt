<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clifford,  George</span>, third earl of Cumberland  (1558&#150;1605), <span class="occ">courtier and privateer</span>, was born on 8 August 1558 in Brougham Castle, Westmorland, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5648/', "Henry Clifford, second earl of Cumberland (1517&#150;1570)")</script>, and his second wife, Anne (<i>c</i>.1538&#150;1581), daughter of William, third Baron Dacre. He spent his early years on his father's estates near his birthplace, and at Skipton Castle in Yorkshire; his education at this stage was Roman Catholic. In January 1570 his father died and George inherited the title and estate, although since he was under age he became a ward of the crown. The wardship was granted to Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, with whom George's father had already been in negotiations concerning the boy's marriage to one of Bedford's daughters. George therefore went to live among the devoutly protestant Russells at Chenies in Hertfordshire. In 1571 he became a student at Trinity College, Cambridge, with the master and future archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, as his tutor. According to his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5641/', "Anne Clifford")</script>, who was his first biographer, it was his love of mathematics which led him to take an interest in navigation. Having graduated MA at Cambridge in 1576, he may also have undertaken a more informal course of study at Oxford.<h2>
<a name="Husbandandcourtier"></a>Husband and courtier</h2>On 24 June 1577 in the church of St Saviour, Southwark, in the presence of the queen, Cumberland wed Lady Margaret Russell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5655/', "Clifford, Margaret, countess of Cumberland (1560&#150;1616)")</script>], the daughter of his guardian, the earl of Bedford. This marriage had long been planned by the families. They had a daughter, Anne, and two sons, Francis and George, both of whom died young. The marriage is reckoned not to have been happy, although the evidence of letters the earl wrote from time to time to his &#145;sweet Meg&#146; suggests that this was not always the case. The countess worried about the immense debts her spendthrift husband built up and described her life as &#145;a dance to the pilgrimage of grief&#146;  (Williamson, <span class="italic">George, Third Earl of Cumberland</span>, 285), which suggests a depressive character. The earl had at least two illegitimate children with different mistresses. At some point in the 1590s the couple began to live apart, although a reconciliation was effected as Clifford lay dying and after he had written begging his wife's forgiveness.<br>
<br>His education and marriage complete, Cumberland became a courtier of Queen Elizabeth. He was never a major political figure under Elizabeth, and was not given a place on her privy council; he did not receive, to his chagrin, a military command under the queen, nor could he be described as one of her most powerful favourites. Nevertheless, he was a most loyal courtier and played an important ceremonial role at court. He enjoyed royal favour, and the distinction of a royal nickname; he was Elizabeth's &#145;rogue&#146;. It seems likely that the queen underestimated Clifford's abilities, but it is understandable perhaps that she should. His most important promotion at court was achieved in 1590, when he was made the queen's champion, a position he held until her death. The main duties involved in this post were to perform at the jousts, especially those held annually to commemorate the queen's accession, when he also gave a speech, some examples of which have survived. Clifford entered enthusiastically into the rich life of a courtier. To quote his puritanical daughter, who perhaps was remembering her mother's views on this: he had &#145;an extreme love for horse races, tiltings, bowling matches and shooting &hellip; and hunting, and all such expensive sports did contribute the more to the wasting of his estate&#146;  (Williamson, <span class="italic">George, Third Earl of Cumberland</span>, 17). He played a more serious role in affairs from time to time, sitting in 1586 on the commission which tried Mary, queen of Scots, and attending her execution the following year at Fotheringhay.<h2>
<a name="Privateer"></a>Privateer</h2>It was partly to recoup some of his losses as a gambler and a courtier that in 1586 Cumberland began his career as a privateer. The war with Spain was just beginning, and Cumberland was also keen to do his patriotic duty and win honour and glory in the maritime sphere, which had interested him since his student days. The first privateering venture he financed he did not himself accompany. Four ships, including two which he had just purchased, the <i>Red Dragon</i> and the <i>Bark Clifford</i>, sailed from Gravesend under Robert Withrington, with instructions to emulate Drake and sail round the Horn to the south seas, where much valuable plunder was to be had. Instead the small fleet turned back without leaving the Atlantic, and gained a few minor prizes off Brazil at the loss of a number of lives. The venture was a considerable waste of money.<br>
<br>The escalating conflict with Spain allowed Cumberland to gain his first personal taste of naval action. In 1587 he sailed across the channel in an attempt to help protect Sluys from the duke of Parma. He arrived too late to prevent the fall of Sluys and instead visited the earl of Leicester's camp at Bergen-op-Zoom. Cumberland played a brave part in the Armada campaign of 1588, offering his two ships for service in the English fleet, and serving himself on board a royal ship, the <i>Elizabeth Bonaventure</i>. He was included in Howard's council of war, fought courageously at the battle off Gravelines, and after the Spanish had retreated north of Harwich he was sent by the admiral to report to the queen at Tilbury. He then returned to the fleet, to help guard against any attempt by Parma to invade from the Netherlands. The earl completed this eventful year by setting out on the first privateering voyage which he himself accompanied, commanded, and financed. The queen lent two royal ships for this expedition, which was intended to intercept enemy shipping in the channel. Cumberland took one insignificant prize, but the royal ship the <i>Golden Lion</i> lost its mast while at anchor in a storm.<br>
<br>During the next ten years Cumberland engaged, either as commander or as promoter, in a privateering voyage every year. The expedition of 1589 was, unusually, a financial success, although with more luck it might have been much more lucrative still. Cumberland commanded the <i>Victory</i>, a royal ship, and took three of his own. He was accompanied by two professional naval commanders, Christopher Lister and William Monson, the latter a man with whom he was to work on other occasions, and with whom he later quarrelled violently. They sailed for the Azores, but narrowly missed intercepting both the Portuguese carracks returning from the East Indies and the Spanish silver fleet sailing from the West. They did take one very rich prize, worth apparently &pound;100,000, but it sank in a storm in Mount's Bay, off Cornwall, as it was being escorted home. Nevertheless, some of its cargo was salvaged, and this, together with the other vessels taken and the proceeds from pillaging Santa Cruz, in the Azores, enabled Cumberland to make a profit on this expedition. He showed his bravery during the voyage, being wounded in an action at St Marie in the Azores, and sharing the considerable suffering of his men as they struggled home with low stocks of water and the wind against them.<br>
<br>In 1590 Cumberland financed two small privateering ventures, which sailed without him and probably broke even financially. The expedition of 1591 he accompanied himself. It involved an attempt to blockade the coast of Spain, while Lord Thomas Howard patrolled the Azores awaiting the Portuguese carracks. Cumberland did not show a profit on this expedition, although his action in dispatching one of his ships to warn Howard of the approach of a Spanish fleet saved much of the Royal Navy from danger. In 1592 Cumberland, undaunted by his previous financial failures, planned to take an expedition across the Atlantic and to harry the Spanish West Indies. He was held up at Plymouth for three months by bad weather, thus missing the chance to cross the ocean, and when the fleet departed with the more limited goal of the Azores, he did not accompany it; it was led instead by John Norton. It joined up with a royal fleet under Sir John Burgh, and together they captured the great Portuguese carrack the <i>Madre de Dios</i> and her cargo of spices, silks, and jewels, estimated to be worth &pound;500,000. Much of the profit from the voyage was lost, plundered by the sailors, and the queen claimed the main share of what was left. This led to a rather bitter dispute between Elizabeth and Cumberland, which ended in the earl's recovering &pound;36,000, which eased his financial position a little while tempting him to continue to try his luck as a privateer.<br>
<br>The following year Cumberland understandably set off for the Azores again, hoping to net another carrack. The voyage was cut short, however, by the earl's illness. He was close to death and his life was only saved by Captain Monson, at great personal risk, securing a cow from the island of Corvo in order to supply him with milk. The bulk of the fleet turned for home to enable their leader to recover his health. In 1594 Cumberland, who from now on worked increasingly closely with syndicates of London merchants, dispatched another fleet to the Azores. It came tantalizingly close to capturing two great carracks, the <i>Cince Chagas</i> of 2000 tons, and the <i>San Felipe</i> of 1500 tons; but the first ship sank after being set on fire in the fight, and the second fought off the privateers. The losses to the earl on this expedition were considerable. Undaunted by this reverse, he commissioned late in 1594 the building at Deptford of the largest ship ever built by an English subject, the 600 ton <i>Malice Scourge</i>, which cost &pound;6000. The expedition of 1595 was a somewhat limited affair, which the earl did not accompany, but the <i>Malice Scourge</i> was at least given her sea trials.<br>
<br>Weighed down with debts, Cumberland suffered two further barren years. Efforts to prosecute a successful expedition early in 1596 were frustrated when the queen ordered him to return to England to station himself off Dover for defensive purposes as the Spanish attacked Calais. The following year his voyage was cut short again, this time when the <i>Malice Scourge</i> lost her main mast in a storm no more than 40 leagues out at sea, and was forced to limp home for repairs.<h2>
<a name="PuertoRico1598andlastyears"></a>Puerto Rico, 1598, and last years</h2>In 1598 Cumberland set out on his last and most glorious expedition, financed by him and his London merchant backers. He took a substantial fleet of twenty vessels, six of which he owned himself, with 1000 seamen and 700 soldiers. After taking a few prizes on the way, the fleet arrived in the West Indies, where Cumberland succeeded in taking San Juan de Puerto Rico. This town had been previously attacked unsuccessfully in 1595 by Drake. Cumberland displayed considerable military skill in devising a successful means of capturing this strongly defended town. He entered the thick of the fighting and would have drowned, having fallen in full armour into a defensive moat, had he not been rescued by one of his officers. The capture of the port proved to be of no great value, however. Like many English strategists, Cumberland had high hopes of establishing a permanent settlement in the West Indies from which to attack the Spanish. But the reality was very different. His men began to die of dysentery in increasing numbers, and in the end he was forced to abandon his conquest and sail home, with very little plunder to show for his expensive investment. He had, however, succeeded in disrupting the economy of the great Spanish empire: as a result of his raid the plate fleet did not sail to Spain in 1598. Although this was the last privateering expedition of the earl, he continued to take an interest in maritime matters; in 1601, when the East India Company was founded, he was one of the original members, and his ship the <i>Malice Scourge</i> was commissioned as one of the first merchantmen employed by the company.<br>
<br>Cumberland's last years were spent in desperate efforts to clear his debts. He seems to have become, rather late in life, more responsible, surprising his friends with a new restraint as a gambler. He began a concerted effort with his estate officials to recover some control over his lands. A process of renegotiating the terms on which his property was leased began, in the course of which large sums of money were raised, which were then used to pay off his debts. He remained active in the life of the court at the end of Elizabeth's reign, sitting on the commission which condemned his friend the earl of Essex in 1601. He was able to transfer his loyalty successfully from Elizabeth to James I. In 1603 he rode north to welcome the new king into his kingdom. James was quick to recognize the value of Cumberland, and appointed him to his privy council. The earl was given an important role to play in the new Stuart settlement of the Anglo-Scottish border. He was appointed warden of the west and middle marches and applied himself assiduously to the pacification of this area, a project which was greatly assisted by the union of the two crowns, and in which as a landowner on the border he had a personal stake.<br>
<br>Cumberland had lived a full and unhealthy life. He died from &#145;a bloody flux&#146;  (Spence, 215)&#151;probably dysentery&#151;on 29 October 1605 at the duchy house by the Savoy in London. Not being survived by any of his sons, in his will he left his lands and titles to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67095/', "Francis Clifford")</script>, which would be the cause of a major dispute when his daughter Anne questioned this settlement. He was buried on 29 December 1605 in the family vault at Holy Trinity, Skipton.<br>
<br>There are many portraits of Cumberland, which show him resplendent as a dazzling aristocratic courtier. Perhaps the best example hangs in the National Maritime Museum; the work of Nicholas Hilliard, it depicts Cumberland as the queen's champion, his hat adorned with the jewelled glove given to him by Elizabeth as a token. Two centuries ago the great antiquary William Whitaker took a look at his embalmed body in the crypt of Skipton church and reported with relish that the portraitists had none of them shown the three warts on his cheek. The judgement of Whitaker on the character and achievements of Cumberland has left its mark on his later biographers. He was &#145;a great but unamiable man&#146; whose story &#145;admirably illustrates the difference &hellip; between fame and virtue&#146;  (Whitaker, 2.354). Whitaker acknowledged the earl's military prowess but condemned him as an unkind father, a faithless husband, and a poor manager of his estates. What Whitaker neglected to weigh in the balance was Cumberland's pious commitment to his family's tradition of absolute loyalty to the Tudor crown. His estate and his marriage were to some degree sacrificed to this.<br>
