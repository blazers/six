<span class="headword">Markham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clutterbuck]</span>,  Beryl</span>  (1902&#150;1986), <span class="occ">aviator and author</span>, was born on 26 October 1902 at Westfield House, Ashwell, Rutland, the younger child and only daughter of Charles Baldwin Clutterbuck, farmer and formerly a lieutenant in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, from which he was cashiered for absence without leave, and his wife, Clara Agnes, daughter of Josiah William Alexander, of the Indian Civil Service. The Clutterbucks went to British East Africa in 1904 and in the following year bought Ndimu Farm at Njoro, overlooking the Rift Valley, where they built a timber and flour mill. In July 1906 Clara left for England with her son and soon divorced her husband. Left with her father, Beryl did not see her mother again until she was twenty-one. She lived a wild childhood with the farm's African children, particularly Kibii (whose name after initiation was arap Ruta), a Kipsigis boy.<br>
<br>In 1911 Beryl was sent to Nairobi European School, from which she was expelled in her third term. She returned to the farm and possibly a promiscuous early adolescence, not being sent to school again until 1916, when an army officer paid for her to attend Miss Seccombe's school in Nairobi, providing he could marry her. She was again expelled. On 15 October 1919, at the age of sixteen, she married the officer&#151;Captain Alexander Laidlaw (Jock) Purves, son of Dr William Laidlaw Purves, founder of the Royal St George's Golf Club in Scotland. Purves bought land adjoining Ndimu Farm, but the marriage lasted only six months. Beryl began to train horses, as her father had done, and in 1921 left her husband to live on Soysambu, the farm on the floor of the Rift Valley owned by the third Baron Delamere. She stayed there as a trainer until 1924, when she left for London, where she discovered she was pregnant. She claimed the child's father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39434/', "Denys Finch-Hatton")</script>, the lover of Karen Blixen, who later wrote <span class="italic">Out of Africa</span> (1937), but she had been so free with her sexual favours that any of a number of people could have been responsible. She had a late abortion and returned to Kenya, where she met Mansfield Markham, the son of Sir Arthur Basil Markham, first baronet, Liberal MP and owner of collieries in the north of England. He was wealthy and they married in 1927.<br>
<br>In 1928 Edward, prince of Wales, and his brother Henry, duke of Gloucester (1900&#150;1974), visited Kenya. Beryl became mistress to Henry. She agreed to go to London to be with him, and he established her in a suite at the Grosvenor Hotel. On 25 February 1929 she had a son, about whom there was much speculation. However, he cannot have been fathered by Prince Henry, because Beryl must already have been pregnant when she met him. The boy was given to Markham's mother to bring up. When Markham threatened to cite Henry as co-respondent in a divorce, Queen Mary, in an effort to avoid scandal, made Henry settle on Beryl a capital sum of &pound;15,000, which provided her with an annuity of &pound;500 until her death.<br>
<br>Beryl stayed in England until 1929, and learned to fly. Back in Kenya, she obtained her commercial pilot's licence in 1933. Following a dare, she decided to fly the Atlantic from east to west. On 4 September 1936 she took off from Abingdon, near Oxford, in a Vega Gull, without a radio. After 21 hours 35 minutes she landed in a bog at Baleine Cove, near Louisburg, Nova Scotia, 100 yards from the ocean, having run out of fuel. She was the first woman to fly the Atlantic from east to west, and the first person to make a solo non-stop crossing in that direction.<br>
<br>F&ecirc;ted in America, she returned there in 1939, and met Raoul Cottereau Schumacher, son of Henri Schumacher, farmer, of Minneapolis. A well-read and articulate man, Schumacher worked as a ghost writer. In 1942 Beryl married him, having divorced Markham in the same year. In June 1942 <span class="italic">West with the Night</span>, by Beryl Markham, was published in America. A remarkable account of her African childhood, it reached thirteen best-seller lists. The book was lyrically written, with many classical and Shakespearian allusions, and in a style similar in places to that of Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, who had befriended Beryl in Hollywood and who may well have been a help with the manuscript. Beryl later claimed that he encouraged her to write the book. It is thought that Schumacher was also a considerable help in editing the manuscript. Some short stories she wrote were later gathered together by her biographer, Mary Lovell, and published as <span class="italic">The Splendid Outcast</span> (1987).<br>
<br>In 1950 Beryl returned to Kenya without Schumacher. Schumacher divorced Beryl in 1960 and died in 1962. Her remaining days were spent training horses in Kenya, South Africa, and Rhodesia. She won the Kenya top trainer's award five times and the Kenya Derby six times. In 1971 her son, whom she had seldom seen, died after a car accident in France, leaving two daughters, and Markham died three months later.<br>
<br>In 1979 the Jockey Club of Kenya allocated Beryl a bungalow at its racecourse. <span class="italic">West with the Night</span> was republished in 1982 and hailed as a lost masterpiece. By 1987, 140,000 copies had been sold and royalties began to pour in. Over a million copies were sold.<br>
<br>Beryl Markham was 5 feet 8 inches tall, of willowy build, with blue eyes, fair hair, slightly wide-spaced teeth, and slim, boyish hips. Her beautiful long oval face had a determined chin. She was exceptionally promiscuous, but retained the loyalty of her male friends. Women found her often ruthless and selfish, although they admitted her stamina, physical prowess, courage, and ability to withstand pain. She died on 3 August 1986 in Nairobi Hospital, from pneumonia, which followed a broken hip. A service of thanksgiving was held in St Clement Danes, London, in September, also marking the fiftieth anniversary of her flight.<br>
