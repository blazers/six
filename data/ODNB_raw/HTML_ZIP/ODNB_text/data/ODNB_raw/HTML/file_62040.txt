<span class="headword">Triplet <span class="st"> [Triplett]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1603?&#150;1670), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in or near Oxford, of unknown parentage, and educated at St Paul's School, London; he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 16 March 1621, and graduated BA on 27 June 1622 and MA 20 June 1625. At Oxford he became a distinguished Greek scholar, wit, and poet. Bishop Morton presented Triplet in 1630 to Woodhorn vicarage, Northumberland, and in 1631 to Whitburn rectory, co. Durham. On 10 April 1640 he was inducted to Washington rectory, co. Durham, holding three parishes in plurality. He was proctor for the archdeacon of Northumberland in the convocation of 1640, and became prebendary of Fenton in York Cathedral in 1641. In October 1645 he was appointed prebendary of Preston in Salisbury Cathedral; he was collated to the ninth stall in Durham Cathedral on 20 March 1649, but parliament sequestrated his ecclesiastical preferments. Following ejection from Washington on 10 September 1644, he fled to Ireland; in 1649 he was keeping a school in Dublin. He edited the 1651 edition of Lord Falkland's <span class="italic">Infallibility of the Church of Rome</span>. In 1656 he was resident teacher at the Dutch embassy, and he was mentioned in John Evelyn's diary in May.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Triplet petitioned for the livings of Whitburn and Washington, regaining Washington rectory in 1660, but resigning in 1662. In April 1661 he proceeded DD by diploma. On 13 March 1662 Triplet established a school at Hayes, Middlesex. Among his pupils was George Ent who, according to Aubrey, was kicked downstairs by Triplet in anger at the boy's cheek. His father, the physician Sir George Ent, took the boy away; &#145;an accident&#146; that &#145;did well-nigh breake Dr Triplett's schoole&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 299). The school survives in the form of Dr Triplett's Church of England primary school, Hayes, Middlesex.<br>
<br>By deed dated 18 November 1664 Triplet named ten life trustees, including John Sudbury, William Sancroft, Isaac Basire, and local gentry, to administer his gift of capital to invest in property, first in Ryton, the annual rents to be divided proportionally between his three former parishes for binding out poor children as apprentices. In 1686, after selling the Ryton property, the trustees bought a 42 acre farm at Stockton-on-Tees. As apprenticeship fees died out, much income remained unused. Rents increased, and an acre of land sold to the North Eastern Railway Company yielded &pound;1000. The surplus was invested in 4 per cent navy stock. As new trustees had no local interest, irregularities occurred in applying funds: some parents apprenticed their children to themselves, and others made up the balance of higher premiums for entrants to occupations not intended by the charity. When no children in Woodhorn were eligible in the early nineteenth century, the rector temporarily ceased to participate in the scheme. The trustees refused the charity commissioners' proposal to take advantage of section 30 of the <span class="roman">Endaved Schools Act</span> of 1869 to use funds for educational purposes; but in 1895 they were obliged to seek permission to offer grants other than for apprenticeships. From 1898 the charity, like others, was controlled by the charity commissioners. They were then permitted to award scholarships and sums below &pound;10 each to deserving children. In 1943 the charity was re-established in three independent trusts, with new rules for appointing trustees, who were to include local authority representatives.<br>
<br>Triplet died on 18 July 1670. His will bequeaths 20 shillings to buy a ring for each of thirty of his previous scholars, and lists his extensive library, which he disposed of among his friends. He was buried later in July 1670 in Westminster Abbey &#145;near the Vestry&#146;, formerly St Faith's Chapel. In the distant south transept, his wall memorial is surmounted by his uncoloured coat of arms in a circle: a doe statant regardant, transfixed at the neck by an arrow, a chief indented. The tinctures are unrecorded.<br>
