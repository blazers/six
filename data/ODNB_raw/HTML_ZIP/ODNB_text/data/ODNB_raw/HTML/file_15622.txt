<span class="headword">Kingsmill,  Andrew</span>  (1537/8&#150;1569), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and religious activist</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75326/', "Sir John Kingsmill (c.1497&#150;1556)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71875/', "Kingsmill family (per. c.1480&#150;1698)")</script>] of Sidmontan, Hampshire, and Constance Goring (<i>d</i>. 1580/81) of Burton, Sussex; he was the fourth of their thirteen children. The Kingsmills were a family of common lawyers that had been prominent in the local politics of Hampshire only since the later 1530s. Both the Kingsmill and Goring families had supported Thomas Cromwell and his policies during the 1530s, along with the incipient cause of protestantism.<br>
<br>Andrew Kingsmill shared his parents' commitment to protestantism and followed his father in studying the law, although in his case it was the civil law. On 23 August 1553 he matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and in 1558 All Souls College elected him a fellow. At the beginning of 1562 he earned the degree of BCL, and with it a reputation for great legal learning which propelled him into the position of dean of law at All Souls College. But during that same time his interests shifted to studying the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and theology. Francis Mills, his friend and contemporary at All Souls, reported that Kingsmill wrote his <span class="italic">A View of Man's Estate; wherein the Great Mercy of God in Man's Free Justification is Showed</span> (posthumously published in London, 1574; reprinted 1576 and 1577) when he was twenty-two years old. According to that statement composition would have taken place some time between 1559 and 1561, but a printed note at the end of the book reads &#145;By M. A. K. The yeare of our Lorde 1562&#146;. It was also said that Kingsmill could recite from memory in Greek the epistles to the <span class="roman">Romans</span> and <span class="roman">Galatians</span>, the first epistle of <span class="roman">St John</span>, various other chapters from the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments, and certain psalms.<br>
<br>According to Wood, at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign Kingsmill was sometimes engaged in preaching protestantism, albeit informally, in an Oxford still dominated by Marian Catholics. During the vestiarian controversy he took up a position opposed to the use of vestments, and wrote to Archbishop Matthew Parker urging tolerance of nonconformity in that matter, which he defined as an indifferent practice. He discussed the same issue with his brother-in-law, Bishop James Pilkington of Durham. In 1566 an anti-vestiarian delegation, including Kingsmill, was sent to Theodore Beza of Geneva but failed to obtain his full support. Kingsmill never returned to England. Instead he remained in Geneva, where he was well regarded. After studying Greek, Hebrew, and theology there for three years as preparation for becoming a minister of religion, he moved on to Lausanne, where he died during September 1569, aged only thirty-one. In his will he left &pound;5 to All Souls to buy the works of Calvin and Peter Martyr for the college library; they were purchased in 1576. Kingsmill published nothing during his short life, but two of his writings were posthumously seen through to publication by Francis Mills, his literary executor and a fellow protestant. Like <span class="italic">A View of Man's Estate</span>, his other work, <span class="italic">A most excellent and comfortable treatise, for all such as are any maner of way either troubled in minde or afflicted in bodie</span> (1577; repr. 1578, 1585), was theological and devotional in nature. Mills assessed Andrew Kingsmill as &#145;a Phoenix among Lawyers, a rare example of godlynesse amongst gentlemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">A View of Man's Estate</span>, preface, sig. A iii).<br>
