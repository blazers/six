<span class="headword">Percival,  Thomas</span>  (1740&#150;1804), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Sankey Street, Warrington, Lancashire, on 29 September 1740, was the son of Joseph Percival (1694&#150;1744), a merchant in Warrington, and his wife, Margaret Orred (1704&#150;1744). His grandfather Peter Percival, the younger son in an old Cheshire yeoman family farming an estate they had long held near Thelwall, Latchford, practised physic in Warrington. His parents died in March 1744, a few days apart, when Thomas, the only surviving son, was three; he was left to the care of an elder sister. In 1750, when he was ten, Thomas Percival MD, his father's eldest brother, a physician in the town and district around Warrington, died, and left him a valuable library and modest private means; Percival was educated first at a private seminary, and then at Boteler grammar school in Warrington, with a year at Manchester grammar school, and he resolved to enter the medical profession.<br>
<br>Percival was a dissenter, and was known in later life as a staunch Unitarian; in 1757 he is said to have been the first student enrolled at the newly established Warrington Academy, which was founded to give a collegiate education to dissenters. On the completion of his course at Warrington he proceeded to the University of Edinburgh, about 1761, where he formed lasting friendships with William Robertson, the historian, David Hume, and other distinguished men. While still a student at Edinburgh he spent a year in London, where he became known to many scientific men, and through the influence of its vice-president, Lord Willoughby de Parham, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 March 1765. It is said that he was the youngest man at that time on whom that honour had been conferred. From Edinburgh he proceeded to Leiden, where he completed his medical studies, and he took his degree on 6 July 1765. For two years he practised his profession in his native town. On 24 March 1766 he married Elizabeth (1747&#150;1822), the only surviving child of Nathaniel Bassnett, merchant, of London.<br>
<br>In 1767 Percival moved to Manchester, where he immediately made many friends; he abandoned his original intention of going to London, and lived in Manchester for the rest of his life. He soon made a reputation by contributing papers to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, and various periodicals, and his essays, medical and experimental, published between 1767 and 1776, attracted wide attention. In 1775 he published the first of three parts of <span class="italic">A Father's Instructions</span>; the concluding part was not issued until 1800. This book for children achieved great popularity. In reply to Richard Price's <span class="italic">Observations on Reversionary Payments</span> (1771), Percival wrote his <span class="italic">Proposals for Establishing More Accurate and Comprehensive Bills of Mortality in Manchester</span>&#151;a contribution to the growing interest in demography. This appeared in his <span class="italic">Essays Medical and Experimental</span> (1773).<br>
<br>Percival became a central figure in the cultural circles of Enlightenment Manchester. At his house the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society was brought into being in 1781. He was elected a vice-president on its foundation, and, with the exception of one year, he occupied the presidential chair from 1782 until his death. In 1785 Percival aided the removal to Manchester of the Warrington Academy, and he took a great interest in its management. An endeavour on his part and that of his friends to found a college of arts and sciences proved unsuccessful, but the scheme was accomplished half a century later under the will of John Owens.<br>
<br>Percival served but briefly as a physician to the Manchester Infirmary, but he helped to lead the reformist faction which took over the governance of the infirmary in 1790 and greatly expanded its services. He helped to form a committee to enforce proper sanitation in Manchester, and advocated the establishment of public baths. He may also be considered as the earliest advocate of factory legislation. On 25 January 1796 he addressed the Manchester committee or board of health on certain evils which had arisen from the growth of the factory system, and he recommended legislative interference in the working conditions of those employed in factories. He helped to found the Manchester Fever Hospital in 1796, and his involvement with infirmary politics led to the publication of his <span class="italic">Medical Ethics</span> (1803), which was widely influential in Britain and the USA. Percival's charm of manner and wide learning gained him friends and correspondents among the most distinguished men and women of his time, in both Europe and North America.<br>
<br>Percival died at his house in Mosley Street, Manchester, on 30 August 1804, leaving a widow, three sons, and more than one daughter. He was buried in the church in which he had been baptized, Warrington parish church, on 3 September, where there is an epitaph by his friend Dr Samuel Parr. A memorial tablet was placed above the president's chair in the rooms of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.<br>
