<span class="headword">Hamilton,  Douglas  Douglas-</span>, fourteenth duke of Hamilton and eleventh duke of Brandon  (1903&#150;1973), <span class="occ">boxer, aviator, and politician</span>, was born on 3 February 1903, the eldest of the seven children of Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, thirteenth duke of Hamilton (1862&#150;1940), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47021/', "Nina Mary Benita Douglas-Hamilton, n&#233;e Poore (1878&#150;1951)")</script>, anti-vivisectionist. He was educated at Eton College and at Balliol College, Oxford (1921&#150;5), but took no degree. Then styled marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale, he was 5 feet 7 inches in height and possessed of exceptional strength. At Oxford he formed a close friendship with Eddie Eagan, the American Rhodes scholar who was the Olympic light heavyweight boxing champion, and Clydesdale succeeded Eagan as captain of the Oxford boxing team. Eagan described Clydesdale as having &#145;the broad shoulders and deft balance of a natural fighter&#146;, and together they went on a world boxing tour, taking on all comers. The tour was chronicled in Eagan's enthusiastic, if effusive, book <span class="italic">Fighting for Fun</span> (1932). Clydesdale reached the semi-finals of the British middleweight amateur championships and won the Scottish middleweight championship; in Scotland his prowess resulted in the sobriquet the Boxing Marquis.<br>
<br>Clydesdale joined the Royal Auxiliary Air Force in 1927 and was rapidly promoted, becoming squadron leader of 602 (City of Glasgow) squadron in 1931. In 1933 he was chosen to be chief pilot of the Houston Mount Everest flight expedition, and on 3 April 1933 was the first man to fly over Everest; he was followed by Flight Lieutenant David McIntyre, both in experimental Westland aircraft. This feat represented a decisive leap forward in aviation development and technology. Clydesdale and McIntyre recounted their experiences in <span class="italic">The Pilot's Book of Everest</span> (1936). Clydesdale was granted the freedom of Hamilton in 1933 and made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society; in 1935 he was awarded the Air Force Cross. The Everest expedition gave Clydesdale and McIntyre the standing as professional flying instructors that they needed to start a flying school at Prestwick, after which they founded Scottish Aviation to build aircraft. More than sixty years and several mergers later, it constituted the Scottish division of British Aerospace. On 2 December 1937 Clydesdale married Lady Elizabeth Ivy Percy (1916&#150;2008), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35472/', "Alan Ian Percy, eighth duke of Northumberland")</script>. They had five sons.<br>
<br>Having unsuccessfully contested Govan in 1929 Clydesdale was elected MP for East Renfrewshire as a Conservative in 1930, and retained the seat until he succeeded to the dukedom in 1940. He spoke in the House of Commons on RAF and Scottish matters, and travelled with other MPs to Russia, Italy, and Germany. His visit to the Berlin Olympic games in 1936 was to have repercussions: while there, he met not only Goering and Milch, in charge of the Luftwaffe, but also Professor Albrecht Haushofer, a personal adviser to Rudolf Hess, and special adviser on foreign affairs to Hitler and Ribbentrop. From the outbreak of war in 1939, Clydesdale served full time with the RAF. He was a sector commander of 11 group, Fighter Command, and was mentioned in dispatches for service during the battle for France in 1940. During the battle of Britain he was station commander for the Turnhouse air sector in Scotland. He succeeded his father as fourteenth duke of Hamilton and hereditary keeper of Holyroodhouse in 1940, and in the same year became lord steward of the royal household, a position he retained until 1964.<br>
<br>Unbeknown to the new duke, in the autumn of 1940 Haushofer had told Hess that Hamilton &#145;had access, at all times, to all important persons in London, even to Churchill and the King&#146;. Hess, who had conceived of the idea of negotiating a peace settlement between Britain and Germany, asked Haushofer to write to Hamilton, a letter which received no reply. On 10 May 1941, the same evening that the House of Commons was bombed, Hess parachuted into Scotland, gave a false name, and asked to see the duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met before. On 11 May Hess admitted to Hamilton that he was on a &#145;personal unauthorised mission&#146;, but claimed that he knew what Hitler's peace terms would be. Hamilton at once flew south to report to the prime minister, who was then at Ditchley Park. Churchill found Hamilton's report hard to believe, saying, &#145;Well, Hess or no Hess, I am going to see the Marx Brothers&#146;. However, later that night he had a long interview with Hamilton, and Hess was identified and treated as a prisoner of war. Later in 1941 Hamilton was promoted to group captain, in command of the Air Training Corps in Scotland. He was made honorary air commodore, and in 1946 was appointed GCVO.<br>
<br>Hamilton, who became president of the British Airline Pilots Association in 1937, was president of the Air League of the British Empire from 1959 to 1968. He was also associated with the Air Cadet Council and the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. In 1962 Julian Amery, minister for aviation, appointed him to chair a committee on civil aviation pilot training; his recommendations were implemented. He was active as an elder of the Church of Scotland, serving as lord high commissioner to the general assembly in 1953, 1954, 1955, and 1958. He had a lifelong interest in young people, and was president of the Boys' Brigade in Scotland, and in promoting sport, presiding over the National Advisory Council on Physical Training (Scotland) and the Scottish Amateur Boxing Association. He had many business interests, and was president of the Building Societies Association (1961&#150;5). From 1948 until his death he was chancellor of St Andrews University, and his last major act was to go to North America in the early 1970s to raise more than &pound;1 million of funds for the university. He died in Edinburgh on 30 March 1973, and was succeeded by his eldest son. His ashes were scattered from the air beside Lennoxlove Politicians Walk on the fortieth anniversary of his flight over Everest.<br>
<br>A devoted Scot, the duke of Hamilton &#145;cared very much about everything to do with Scotland, both in the preservation of her past tradition and continuing identity, but more especially in the building of her future as a meaningful country in the modern world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>); his creation of the aviation industry in Scotland was his single most important contribution.<br>
