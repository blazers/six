<span class="headword">Walton,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1415, <em>d.</em> 1489?), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born before 1415 in the diocese of Lincoln. He was educated at Oxford, being dispensed in connection with qualifications for a doctorate on 6 June 1450, and was made a BCnL before 1472, probably long before that date. He was a canon of the Augustinian abbey of Osney, near Oxford, by 1433 and was ordained deacon in Worcester Cathedral on 20 February 1434. In 1452 he became abbot of Osney; the temporalities were restored on 1 November 1452. After twenty years as abbot, during which the <span class="italic">English Register</span> of the abbey was compiled, he was promoted by Edward IV to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1472. On 19 March 1472 he was granted custody of temporalities of the see; the papal provision was dated 4 May 1472 and he was consecrated archbishop in England by August of that year. Subsequently he was enthroned in Holy Trinity Cathedral in Dublin.<br>
<br>Within his diocese Walton was active in pastoral and diocesan affairs if not in politics. He defended the rights of his see; he controversially attempted to exercise his jurisdiction over the dean and chapter of St Patrick's Cathedral; he asserted his rights of visitation of religious houses. In 1478 he procured from the Irish parliament the restitution of several manors alienated by his predecessors earlier in the century. A letter was addressed to him by the University of Oxford about its <i>degenerate alumni</i> preaching heresy in his diocese in 1483. He retained connections with Osney Abbey and clearly travelled between Ireland and England since letters of protection were granted to him crossing to England on business in 1474 and 1477. On 14 June 1484, being then blind and infirm, Walton resigned the archbishopric and retired to his manor of Swords with an annual pension of &pound;100 drawn from the revenues of the archiespiscopal mensa of Dublin. The manor of Swords was also reserved to him for his maintenance for life, the possession of which was assured to him by an act of parliament in the following year. According to the antiquarian James Ware, the register of Swords commented favourably on Walton's generous hospitality and cheerful, innocent disposition.<br>
<br>Despite his infirmity Walton continued to preach on occasion. On St Patrick's day (17 March) 1489 he preached a sermon before the lord deputy and nobility in St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. He died soon afterwards. His will is undated but was made, before his resignation as archbishop, on an occasion when he was about to cross from Ireland to England. In it he requested that should he die in England his body should be buried among the abbots in Osney Abbey. He wished his copy of John de Burgh's <span class="italic">Pupilla oculi</span> to be restored to the abbey, along with numerous vestments and mass requisites and other books. It is unknown, however, where and when he died or where he was buried; but it is most probable that he died at his castle of Swords and that he was buried in the vicinity.<br>
