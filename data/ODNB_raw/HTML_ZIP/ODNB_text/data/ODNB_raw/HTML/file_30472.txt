<span class="headword">Ashley, Sir  William James</span>  (1860&#150;1927), <span class="occ">economic historian</span>, was born at 11 Sun Street, Bermondsey, London, on 25 February 1860. He was the eldest son of James Ashley, a journeyman hatter from Wrexham, Denbighshire, and his wife, Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Short). He was educated at St Olave's Grammar School, Southwark, London, and in 1878 went up to Balliol College, Oxford, as Brackenbury scholar in modern history, graduating in 1881 with first-class honours. In 1882 he won the university's Lothian essay prize. Ashley remained in Oxford until 1888, continuing with his studies, acting initially as a private tutor and, after 1885, as a fellow of Lincoln College and lecturer at Corpus Christi College. He had developed an interest in economic history as an undergraduate: this interest was strengthened by his attending the lectures of Arnold Toynbee on the industrial revolution in the winter of 1881&#150;2, and by three visits to Germany, in particular to the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where he was influenced by the work of the German historical school of economists, notably Gustav Schmoller (whom he was to meet in 1902), Karl Knies, Bruno Hildebrand, Wilhelm Roscher, and Adolf Wagner. On 2 July 1888 he married Annie Margaret Hill (1859/60&#150;1922), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33870/', "George Birkbeck Hill")</script>, the Johnsonian scholar. They had three children, one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Shortly after his marriage Ashley took up the post of professor of political economy and constitutional history at the University of Toronto, Canada. His main reason for leaving Oxford was to be &#145;free from the irksome necessity of tutorial work&#146;  (W. J. Ashley to Richard T. Ely, 2 Feb 1888, Ely MSS) which, he stated, &#145;prevented my doing good work on my own&#146;  (W. J. Ashley to E. R. A. Seligman, n.d. 1888, Seligman MSS). He had attempted to gain more freedom in Oxford by applying for the chair of political economy in early 1888, but he had been unsuccessful. At the time of this application Ashley had felt that his chances of success were slim because historical economic studies were looked down upon by the increasingly powerful mathematical school of economists led by Alfred Marshall of Cambridge. One of Marshall's acolytes, F. Y. Edgeworth, did indeed get the Oxford chair, thereby confirming Ashley's view that he was unlikely to prosper in the world of academic economics in Britain.<br>
<br>The basis for Ashley's differences with the Marshallians was crisply outlined in the preface to his <span class="italic">Introduction to Economic History and Theory</span>, published in 1888 soon after his arrival at Toronto. Ashley stated that &#145;Political Economy is not a body of absolutely true doctrines&#146;. Like other British historical economists, notably W. Cunningham, H. S. Foxwell, W. A. S. Hewins, and L. L. Price, Ashley argued that deductive, abstract reasoning could not provide the basis for meaningful or effective economic theory or practice, and that statements of economic principle were true only in relation to given historical conditions. This historical relativism was anathema to Marshallian, neo-classical economists who were keen to establish economics as a science, and in both academic debate and in the distribution of senior academic appointments the Marshallians sought to marginalize the historical school.<br>
<br>The North American academic world was, however, more open to historical economics, and Ashley flourished at Toronto and then, in 1892, was appointed to a chair specifically created for him in economic history at Harvard University. At Harvard he completed the second volume of his <span class="italic">Introduction</span> (1893) and produced a series of lectures and essays arguing for the centrality of the historical method to economics which were published in 1900 as <span class="italic">Surveys, Historic and Economic</span>. In the latter half of the 1890s he turned his mind to the problems of eighteenth-century commercial history, and his works <span class="italic">The Tory Origin of Free Trade Policy</span> (1897) and <span class="italic">The Commercial Legislation of England and the American Colonies</span> were not only important historical studies of the theory and practice of eighteenth-century mercantilism, but also indicated an implicit scepticism about the wisdom of free trade.<br>
<br>In 1901 Ashley and his wife returned to Britain. Mason College, Birmingham, had been converted into the University of Birmingham and Ashley was appointed as its first professor of commerce. Here Ashley had the chance to design his own curriculum, and sought to structure a course that was both academically strong and of practical use to businessmen. The degree course he designed was based on economics and economic history with particular emphasis on the structure, organization, and administration of industry, which reflected his own interests and also the influence of the American institutional economists (such as Richard T. Ely and E. R. A. Seligman) with whom he had worked in the United States. Ashley held this post until his retirement in 1925.<br>
<br>Birmingham University owed its existence to the interest and wealth of the great local businessman and politician Joseph Chamberlain. When Chamberlain launched the campaign for tariff reform in May 1903 Ashley became one of its strongest academic supporters. After Alfred Marshall and his neo-classical acolytes sent a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in September 1903 criticizing tariff reform and defending free trade, Ashley, along with most of his fellow historical economists, signed a countering letter the next month. Late in 1903 Ashley produced a powerful case for tariffs in <span class="italic">The Tariff Problem</span>, which Chamberlain himself described as &#145;the best manual we have&#146;  (J. Chamberlain to W. J. Ashley, 26 April 1904, Chamberlain MSS), and he further pressed the tariff case in a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> and <span class="italic">Economic Review</span> throughout the first decade of the century. Ashley's historical approach to economic problems had led him to the conclusion that, as circumstances had changed since the introduction of free trade, so policy had to be adapted to new conditions. But Ashley was not simply interested in tariffs for their own sake. He had long been interested in social questions, and his book <span class="italic">The Progress of the German Working Class in the Last Quarter of a Century</span>, published in 1904, argued that the protection afforded to German domestic employment by tariffs and the German government's social insurance and old age pensions provision, partly paid for by tariff revenues, showed how to achieve improved social conditions in Britain. His correspondence with leading Conservative politicians during the Edwardian period thus stressed the need for a social reform programme, and he became an adviser to the unionist Social Reform Committee after 1911.<br>
<br>Ashley was awarded a PhD by the University of Berlin in 1910 and in 1912 delivered a series of lectures at Hamburg, published as <span class="italic">The Economic Organisation of England</span> (1914). With the outbreak of the First World War he was drawn into government service, largely as an expert adviser on, for example, the departmental committee on food prices in 1916, and the Sumner committee on the cost of living in 1918, where his statistical knowledge was at a premium. It was largely for these services that he was knighted in 1917. He was appointed a member of the royal commission on agriculture in 1919 and also to the agricultural tribunal of investigation which sat from December 1922 to May 1924. While working for the tribunal he undertook a tour of Denmark to study that country's agricultural system, and he became a great admirer of Danish farming. In December 1924 Ashley was appointed a member of the departmental committee on industry and trade, and, following his retirement from his chair in 1925, devoted a great deal of time to the committee's work&#151;so much so that he turned down an offer to sit on the Coal Commission in 1925 on the grounds that, though retired, he was too busy.<br>
<br>Ashley spent his last years working in his various public capacities and on his own studies. He had retained his links with Oxford. In 1920 he was made an honorary fellow of Lincoln College, and in 1925 he was one of the main organizers of the celebrations to mark the bicentennial of John Wesley's election to a fellowship at the college. In 1923 he had been invited by Oxford University to be Ford's lecturer, and intended to take as his subject the historical place of rye in the diet of the English people, but his work for the agricultural tribunal had made it impossible to deliver the lectures. However, he continued to work on the subject and completed the manuscript of his book <span class="italic">The Bread of our Forefathers: an Enquiry in Economic History</span>, which was to be published posthumously in 1928. Ashley's last important public, academic role was when he acted as chairman of the economic history section of the Anglo-American Conference of Professors and Teachers of History in July 1926. That summer he was taken ill with cancer. In November he underwent a major operation, but the progress of the illness was not halted and he died at his home, 3 St Stephen's Road, Canterbury, Kent, on 23 July 1927. His funeral service was held in Canterbury Cathedral on 27 July and he was buried there the same day. That his funeral was held in such a location was a tribute not only to his academic and public distinction, but also to his active membership of the Church of England which had culminated with a leading role in the Modern Churchman's Conference.<br>
<br>Ashley's career as an academic was, both institutionally and intellectually, of great significance. At Harvard he held the first chair in economic history in the English-speaking world, and, as professor of commerce at Birmingham, he has reasonable claims to being the founder of business studies in Britain. As a leading member of the British school of historical economics he played an important role in the <i>Methodenstreit</i> with the Marshallians, and made a significant contribution to the development of economic history as a discipline in Britain.<br>
