<span class="headword">Dixon,  Ella Nora  Hepworth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Margaret Wynman]</span>  (1857&#150;1932), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, was born on 27 March 1857 at Essex Villa, Queens Road, Marylebone, London, the seventh of the eight children (two of whom died young) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7709/', "William Hepworth Dixon (1821&#150;1879)")</script>, author and traveller, who came from Yorkshire, and his wife, Mary Ann MacMahon, a forward-looking Irishwoman. Hepworth Dixon's reminiscences, <span class="italic">As I Knew Them: Sketches of People I have Met on the Way</span> (1930), portray some of the people she met at her parents' parties. Privately tutored, she went briefly to school in Heidelberg and studied painting in Paris. After her father died she began a career as a journalist, writing for <span class="italic">The World</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. She was the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>'s art critic and published short stories in <span class="italic">Lady's Pictorial</span>, <span class="italic">Woman's World</span>, the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, and <span class="italic">Woman</span>. Her first book, published under the pseudonym Margaret Wynman, was <span class="italic">My Flirtations</span> (1892), light-hearted pieces about contemporary life.<br>
<br>In 1894 Hepworth Dixon published <span class="italic">The Story of a Modern Woman</span>, a realistic novel which explores (by implication) the difficulties women have in writing truthfully about their lives. Partly autobiographical, it is about Mary Erle, who attends art school while living with her eminent scientist father; after his early death she is close only to Alison Ives and Vincent Hemming. The former dies after visiting her fianc&eacute;'s abandoned mistress; on her deathbed she exhorts Mary: &#145;If women &hellip; were only united we could lead the world&#146;  (Dixon, <span class="italic">Modern Woman</span>, 213). Vincent rejects Mary and marries for money, unhappily; she becomes an illustrator and journalist. In the end she refuses to become her lover's mistress but chooses instead a life that is fulfilled, if lonely. Her motive is solidarity with Vincent's wife: &#145;All we modern women mean to help each other now&#146;  (ibid., 255). This phrase, Hepworth Dixon said, was the keynote of the book: &#145;It is a plea for a kind of moral and social trades-unionism among women&#146;  (<span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, 71). An additional theme is a satire on Grub Street, as Mary is shown trying to earn her living despite the prejudices of male editors who tell her that, unlike newspapers, fiction has to be written for &#145;healthy English homes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Modern Woman</span>, 181). Published to huge acclaim by William Heinemann, &#145;a lifelong friend&#146;, the novel &#145;led to many literary friendships&#146;  (Dixon, <span class="italic">As I Knew Them</span>, 187) in England, America, and Europe&#151;it was translated into French&#151;and also led to the nickname the &#145;New Woman&#146; for its author.<br>
<br>Hepworth Dixon never published another novel but led an extremely sociable life, describing in her reminiscences people such as Oscar Wilde, H. G. Wells, Max Beerbohm, Yeats, Osbert Sitwell, and Somerset Maugham. Her life is an example of the seductive rewards of literary success leaving little time for further serious literary work; also an example, perhaps, of someone whose emotional life was blighted by the death of an adored parent. Hepworth Dixon edited <span class="italic">The Englishwoman</span> from March to August 1895 (and increasingly came to champion women's rights); in 1904 she published <span class="italic">One Doubtful Hour, and other Side-Lights on the Feminine Temperament</span>, a collection of short stories. In 1908 her one-act play <span class="italic">The Toy-Shop of the Heart</span> was produced in London. She continued in her &#145;pleasant, easy style&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) to write numerous articles for magazines on subjects such as &#145;Is marriage a failure?&#146; or &#145;Wardrobes&#146;. She was vice-president of the committee of the Femina Vie Heureuse and Northcliffe prizes for literature. A charming-looking woman with curly brown hair and a pert nose, Ella Hepworth Dixon died unmarried, of respiratory disease, on 12 January 1932 at the Savoy Court Hotel, 23 Granville Place, London, and was cremated three days later at Golders Green.<br>
