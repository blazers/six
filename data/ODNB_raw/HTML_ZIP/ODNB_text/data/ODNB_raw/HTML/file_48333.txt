<span class="headword">Tattersall,  John Brown</span>  (1845&#150;1925), <span class="occ">cotton spinner</span>, was born on 30 September 1845 at Sandy Lane, Royton, Oldham, Lancashire, one of the nine children of Stanley Tattersall, a master tailor, and his wife, Nancy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kershaw. Having started work at the age of ten as a half-time little piecer in the Sandy Lane cotton mill, he graduated to become a minder of cotton mules and became actively involved in the spinners' union. He was elected to the executive committee of the Oldham Operative Cotton Spinners' Union in April 1870, participated over the years 1870&#150;73 in the shorter working hours campaign, served on the Oldham Trades Council in 1872, and became a key figure in the Factory Acts Reform Association. On 18 December 1867 he married Mary Ann Cocker (<i>b</i>. 1843/4), a weaver, the daughter of Matthew Cocker, a draper, at Prestwich parish church.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Tattersall had accumulated funds which he invested in the Royton Spinning Company. In November 1873 he made the transition from manual to white-collar worker when he was appointed secretary of the Royton mill. Thereafter he moved through various jobs&#151;he was in Manchester for a spell as yarn salesman for Royton&#151;and into company management. He served successively as general manager (1891&#150;1903), managing director (1903&#150;6), and chairman of the Royton company (1906&#150;23). The survival of the company through the slump in the 1920s is testimony to the firm foundations which he laid. His opposition to mill recapitalization in 1919&#150;20 played an important part in this. Tattersall used the Royton company as a base from which he invested in and promoted other limited liability cotton manufacturing companies in the region. By the 1900s his directorships included twelve mills, and he controlled almost half of the spinning capacity of the Royton area.<br>
<br>It was perhaps inevitable that Tattersall, as a prominent and gregarious employer, should become embroiled in the politics of the industry. He was an active member of the Limited Liability Association in the 1870s and 1880s (acting as secretary for a while) and in February 1890 was elected to the executive committee of the Oldham Master Cotton Spinners' Association, of which he became president a year later. One of his earliest confrontations with the Oldham Spinners' Union concerned his opposition to proposed new factory legislation (1891), the irony of which was not overlooked by his former trade union colleagues.<br>
<br>In the early 1890s Tattersall worked to promote more representative and powerful employer combinations in cotton spinning, and he played a key part in the formation of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners' Associations (FMCSA) in 1892; later he became federation vice-president. He was one of a handful of mill owners (including Macara, Andrew, and Reyner) who led the industry-wide Brooklands lock-out and the negotiations thereafter. During this pivotal confrontation Tattersall gained a reputation as an uncompromising hardliner and champion of managerial prerogatives: &#145;We cannot allow the operatives&#146;, he commented, &#145;to dictate as to the conditions upon which we shall work our concerns&#151;it won't do at all!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cotton Factory Times</span>, 13 Jan 1893).<br>
<br>For almost thirty years Tattersall devoted his energies to industry politics and the advancement of mill owners' interests; he remained president of the Oldham Master Cotton Spinners' Association until 1919, and was vice-president of the FMCSA until 1914 and president from 1914 to 1918. He was an active Liberal in politics, one-time president of the Royton Liberal Association, and a staunch supporter of free trade. He co-ordinated the FMCSA's parliamentary monitoring and pressure group activities (serving on the cotton employers' parliamentary committee, 1893&#150;1910), became involved in cotton trade regulation (through the federation cotton committee and the British Cotton Growing Association), and served as a committee member of the International Cotton Spinners' Association (1903&#150;14). Through active involvement in the organization committee, Tattersall bears some credit for the increasing power of the FMCSA, which grew from representing around 40 per cent (17 million spindles) of the capacity of the spinning industry in 1892 to nearly 75 per cent (46 million spindles) in 1918.<br>
<br>As far as industrial relations policy making was concerned, Tattersall was involved at the highest levels of the federation, representing the employers in the conciliation board, the emergency committee, the various wage-list committees, and the joint disputes committees which met under the Brooklands procedure. He developed a reputation as a defender of managerial rights, an astute and tough negotiator who promulgated, on a number of occasions, the use of the industry-wide lock-out as a tactic. Over time, however, he came to realize the potential within the formalized disputes procedure for containing and defusing trade union militancy and became adept at exploiting the system to protect employers' interests. In one dispute over a mill owner's alleged use of shoddy raw cotton in 1901, for example, he entered the mill (J. Mayall's, Ashton) as part of a joint inspection team, immediately held up a wet finger, and declared that an east wind was blowing off the Pennines and that the spinning could not be inspected properly until it had stopped! The inspection took place several days later, giving the mill owner time to purchase better cotton and get it through the mules.<br>
<br>Mainly because of the paucity of extant source material, Tattersall's role has been overshadowed by that of Charles Macara, FMCSA president from 1894 to 1914. What appears evident from the records of the mill owners' associations, however, is that Tattersall's contribution to cotton industry politics was far more significant than Macara's autobiography and biography were willing to concede.<br>
<br>Tattersall presided over the FMCSA, after Macara resigned in 1914, during the difficult wartime years. He retired from his associational activities in 1918&#150;19 and from his directorships in 1923. He was reported to have been in failing health for some time, and died on 3 September 1925, at his home, Ash Grove, Oriel Road, Didsbury, Manchester, leaving &pound;71,661 gross.<br>
