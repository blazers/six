</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hickeringill,  Edmund</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1631, <em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Aberford (near Leeds) where he was baptized on 19 September 1631. His father, Edmund Hickhorngill, the subject of a public proclamation in 1638 for absenting himself from church, was a recusant and the favoured servant of the papist Sir John Gascoigne. After attending Pocklington School, Yorkshire, on 17 June 1647 Hickeringill was admitted as pensioner to St John's College, Cambridge, where some of the principles he would later display were, perhaps, instilled by his tutor Zachary Cawdrey. After the Restoration Cawdrey, although a conforming and beneficed Anglican minister, was nevertheless considered &#145;guilty of sinfull popularity and coaxing the Dissenters Party&#146; in Chester, and produced a discourse on conformity to the established church, &#145;on principles granted by the Non-Conformists&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 34, fols. 26&#150;7). Hickeringill graduated BA in 1651 and on Lady day was intruded as junior fellow into Gonville and Caius College by the parliamentary committee for regulating the universities&#151;probably at the instigation of his tutor. Despite a mission to London by the master, William Dell, &#145;to reverse if possible the Orders&#146;  (C. Brooke, <span class="italic">History of Caius College</span>, 1985, 133), Hickeringill proceeded MA in midsummer 1652. On 24 August, having undertaken adult baptism, he was admitted to the communion of Thomas Tillam's newly founded Baptist congregation at Hexham in Northumberland, and on 20 December the church &#145;ordained brother Hickhorngill a minister, and their messenger in Scotland&#146;  (Underhill, 251). He arrived at Dalkeith on 30 December whence, having been handed over by General Monck to be chaplain in Robert Lilburne's regiment of horse, on 8 January 1653 he began a series of letters to the Hexham congregation relating his progress.<h2>
<a name="Apostasytoordination16531664"></a>Apostasy to ordination, 1653&#150;1664</h2>Hickeringill soon perceived that to elements within the rank and file his position as chaplain was a &#145;chief stumbling-block&#146; from the way of God, and desired of Lilburne some other employment &#145;whereby I might live without making the gospel burdensome&#146;  (Underhill, 308). In March 1653 he joined a Baptist congregation at Leith, but by May his religious opinions were in turmoil: he became a Quaker and went missing. He returned to Dalkeith on 12 July &#145;in a swaggering garb&#146;, declaring that his devotion was worn threadbare, and that he had &#145;left his religion in England&#146;  (Underhill, 330). The Hexham congregation excommunicated their &#145;alas! deluded&#146; messenger, but it was reported that Hickeringill&#151;a &#145;desperate atheist&#146;&#151;cared &#145;not a fig&#146; for this sentence  (ibid., 328, 330, 331). &#145;Full of joy in his God&#146;, he propounded &#145;no other rule to himself but his reason&#146;  (ibid., 331). Despite resuming his chaplaincy, he nevertheless omitted from his duties any sacerdotal functions, so that he &#145;would neither pray nor preach, otherwise than by common discourse&#146;, and was granted instead a military commission as lieutenant to Captain Gascoigne in Colonel Daniell's regiment  (Underhill, 331). Although his links with the Baptists were apparently severed, his religious mission did not end here. In Gelsland, Hickeringill was one of a number of &#145;Military Independent Officers&#146;, men of &#145;more Witt and Ingenuity then solidity and serious Religion&#146;, who &#145;in their Buff-Coats and Armour&#146; preached in vacant cures around Carlisle. A hostile account of their ministry, noting their capacity for sowing schism, commented that they &#145;talked to the people what they saw fitt&#146;  (Nightingale, 1.376).<br>
<br>By his own account Hickeringill remained four years in Scotland, where he was &#145;governor and deputy governor&#146; of Finlarig and Meikleour castles, Perthshire, and was &#145;one of the first and last justices of the peace that ever were in Scotland&#146;  (Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.29). Entering next into foreign service, he accepted a commission as captain under Major-General Fleetwood, then ambassador to Sweden. He departed Hull for Hamburg with a company of 125 mercenaries, was made governor of Buckstaho, a Swedish garrison in Bremen, and was present at the siege of Elsinor. He sailed to Spain and Portugal, was active throughout the West Indies, and made a stay in Jamaica  (<span class="italic">Letters to Thoresby</span>, 2.10&#150;12). Prompted to return to England at the Restoration, Hickeringill curried favour by drafting and publishing in 1661 an account of Jamaica dedicated to Charles II. In reward Charles made him secretary of state for Jamaica under Baron Windsor &#145;then going governour&#146;, a post worth &pound;1000 a year. Awaiting departure for the Caribbean, however, Hickeringill performed an enigmatic volte-face: why he &#145;left the Secretaries place (so very profitable and honourable) to be a Divine, I do not know&#146;, puzzled his editor  (E. Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Jamaica Viewed</span>, 1705, preface). He was &#145;persuaded into orders&#146; by Robert Sanderson, bishop of Lincoln, nicknamed (Hickeringill claimed) the &#145;presbyterian bishop&#146;  (Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.379). Sanderson and Gilbert Sheldon, the bishop of London, apparently considered him particularly suited, in the wake of the St Bartholomew's day ejections, to minister to the burgeoning nonconformity in Colchester, Essex  (<span class="italic">Letters to Thoresby</span>, 2.15). Following brief preferment as vicar of St Peter's there, Hickeringill was instituted on 21 October 1662 to the neighbouring rectory of All Saints, which he would hold until his death, and on 22 October to the vicarage of Boxted, 10 miles to the north. He settled in nearby Wickes and married; his wife's name was Mary, and they had four daughters and two sons, Thomas and Matthias.<h2>
<a name="Conductasaminister"></a>Conduct as a minister</h2>Following his ordination Hickeringill swiftly signalled his loyalty to the royal supremacy but also his dissidence from episcopal authority. In a sermon on 30 January 1662 he likened the royal martyr to the biblical figure of Naboth, an innocent vintner stoned to death for blasphemy. Yet at the same time in Boxted he began a habit of adapting Church of England ceremonial to his own standards. In 1664 he was prosecuted in the court of arches by a number of the village's dissenting (probably Quaker) parishioners for omitting to recite the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> before his congregation in the words and manner stipulated by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. Reciting the articles before his congregation, Hickeringill had interjected into the ceremony a list of heterodox beliefs which contradicted the established articles, so as to underscore the divisiveness of the church's liturgy. The irony of nonconformist parishioners' stipulating precise adherence to the Anglican rubric is a symptom of Hickeringill's equivocal relationship with the orthodox communion. In pursuing a local policy of comprehension, which undermined the national religious settlement, he won over moderate nonconformists but alienated more uncompromising dissidents. By 1663 his dispensation to hold the Boxted living was withdrawn, and his relations with his dissenting parishioners had descended into a series of violent skirmishes. Abandoning Boxted in 1664, he received a new presentation to All Saints under the great seal of England. His turbulent reputation did not diminish: in 1668 he was ejected from his house near Wickes in Essex, where he was perpetual curate, by a clamorous uprising of more than forty people from three villages, and the same year the Colchester borough assembly advised the bishop of London that he was &#145;not a man of peaceable and quiet temper&#146;, and thus not suitable for presentation to an additional living  (Essex RO D/b5, Gb5, fol. 10). In 1673 he appeared as pamphleteer with an attack against Andrew Marvell's <span class="italic">Rehearsal Transpros'd</span> and the philosophy behind religious separatism. &#145;For all our worship of God; prayers, praises, and preachings, observing Lords Days and Sacraments&#146;, asked Hickeringill, &#145;Is He the better for them?&#146;  (E. Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Gregory, Father Greybeard</span>, 1673, 67). Dissenters placed empty doctrine before the king's laws; instead, he proposed that adherence to a minimalist creed could make all fanatics good conformists. He dramatized this theme on 9 May 1680 when, in a caustic sermon before the lord mayor, Sir Robert Clayton, in the Guildhall chapel, London, he hurled the curse of Meroz on all who, like his bishop, Henry Compton, slighted the law by allowing latitude to dissenters. This sharp reproach, which Hickeringill acknowledged was contrary to his &#145;natural tenderness and inclination&#146; towards nonconformists, displayed instead his antipathy towards the meddling of bishops in civil affairs; a symptom of which, he claimed, was that English clergymen treated as a piece of apocrypha the best example of loyalty in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. For Hickeringill, concerned with the political status of doctrines and beliefs, all rebellion came cloaked in religious dress. He challenged both bishops and nonconformists, who concurred that domination was founded in grace.<br>
<br>This enmity with his diocesan was to shape Hickeringill's subsequent career: through litigation or print he was in almost constant dispute with the forces of ecclesiastical authority. Compton set aside the tithes of St Botolph's, Colchester, which had (since 1544) been enjoyed by the rectors of All Saints, in favour of a more compliant clergyman. Ignoring the edict, Hickeringill established himself in open competition with his local rival for church business: he poached tithes, proposed to &#145;rout&#146; a neighbouring cleric from his livings for a &pound;20 fee, offered to marry at reduced rates and without banns or licence, and intercepted funeral processions in order to read the service. He posed as a barrister, teaching his neighbours how to avoid the exactions of the spiritual courts, and between 1680 and 1683 unleashed a virulent print attack on episcopacy and the legality of church courts. Compton pursued him with a stream of litigation: on 3 March 1681 Hickeringill was tried, before Judge Baron Weston at Chelmsford assizes, on an indictment of twenty-four charges of barratry. He mounted his own defence, and in a display of legal acumen trounced the prosecution's rising star, Sir George Jeffreys. The case was dismissed, although the tory press reported his conviction for perjury. Compton next had him cited to the court of arches to answer charges relating to his deviant ministerial conduct around Colchester, but when he appeared before Sir Robert Wiseman on 8 June 1681, he adopted the sectarian gesture of refusing to remove his hat, and would speak only in Greek, the language (he claimed) of the canon law. When a court official grabbed the offending headgear, Hickeringill snatched it back, and upon the announcement that his carriage amounted to a non-appearance, he denounced the arches as &#145;no Court of Law&#146;, and threatened to prosecute Wiseman according to statute for citing him outside his own diocese  (Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.176). Wiseman stopped the proceedings. Upon a second appearance on 21 November Hickeringill submitted a written defence, which four days later was allowed. The consequence of his Erastian protest was, on 8 February, to be bound over to good behaviour in king's bench, for &#145;his unmannerly deportment before the Court of Civil Law&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>9 Feb 1682</i>).<br>
<br>Compton settled the score by prosecuting Hickeringill for slander, &#145;scandalum magnatum&#146;, under the statute 2 Ric. II c. 5. The cleric had defamed his bishop with &#145;several false news and horrible lyes&#146;  (Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Scandalum magnatum</span>, 8) at an Easter election of parish officials, although in his defence Hickeringill claimed to have been quoted out of context. Furthermore, he had failed to address his superior with the customary epithet of &#145;Right Reverend Father in God&#146;. He subsequently compounded his insubordination by using the occasion of his trial, at Chelmsford assizes on 8 March, as a public platform to derogate the &#145;Black Regiment&#146; of bishops  (ibid., 15). Jeffreys, again counsel for the prosecution, elicited a conviction and a &pound;2000 fine against Hickeringill, which Compton earmarked for the rebuilding of St Paul's. For celebrating clandestine marriages Hickeringill was suspended for three years. In the aftermath he sent (and then published) a letter to Compton which, purportedly seeking an accommodation through flattery, in fact boldly restated the grounds of his original dissidence. He refused to pay the fine and, offering to pay Compton's legal costs, challenged a retrial. Finally, on 27 June 1684, Hickeringill received restoration and exemption from the punishment upon a public recantation in the court of arches of the &#145;scandalous, erroneous, and seditious principles&#146; of several of his publications  (Luttrell, 1.312). The dean of the arches offered to Sancroft &#145;to burne with mine owne hands&#146; each of the books in public  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 32, fol. 70). The fine's remission, however, came too late to secure Hickeringill a &pound;20,000 fortune: his uncle Dr Troutbeck, Charles II's surgeon in the north and sometime translator of Erastus, had altered the disposal of his estate, &#145;lest any of the lawn-sleeves should lay their fingers on't&#146;  (Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.117). Hickeringill's redemption was short-lived. His sermon in 1685 on <span class="roman">Philippians</span> 2: 10&#151;&#145;At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow&#146;&#151;was a pretext for the tory recorder of Colchester and activist against nonconformity, Sir John Shaw, to complain to his friend the chancellor of the diocese. Hickeringill was charged with preaching against Anglican ceremonial, and peremptorily suspended. Petitions to the king, and a letter of &#145;apology and defence&#146; to Sancroft&#151;in which he compared the Romanist doctrine of infallibility with the Church of England's prescriptions on ceremonies and matters &#145;indifferent&#146;, and made a strong historical defence of dissent within a fallible church&#151;were to no avail  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 32, fol. 232). Only in 1688, &#145;about a month before the Dutch landed&#146;, was he recalled  (Hickeringill, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.380).<br>
<br>On 15 January 1691 Hickeringill became chaplain to the whig Edward Howard, earl of Carlisle, and the following day was granted dispensation to hold the vicarage of Fingringhoe, adjoining Colchester. In <span class="italic">The Survey of the Earth</span> (1705) he implicated the Church of England in a long historical tradition where true religion was supplanted by superstition: the common prayer in particular was cited as containing pagan beliefs. Though Hickeringill was now old, Compton had him cited before the ecclesiastical court for its authorship in November  (Luttrell, 5.607), and, perhaps as a consequence, in March 1706 Hickeringill published a <span class="italic">Letter Concerning Barretry, Forgery and the Danger and Malignity of Partial Judges and Jurymen</span>. In 1707 he was tried for forgery in his capacity as tax assessor for the parish of Wickes. For altering the rate books, and &#145;as a specimen of his morality&#146;, he was fined &pound;400. &#145;He carried himself with that indecency to the court&#146;, noted Hearne, &#145;that he was thought to be mad&#146;  (Hearne, <span class="italic">Collectanea</span>, 2.33). His final court appearance, on 1 November, was in queen's bench on an information against him for writing libels.<br>
<br>Hickeringill died at his home, Pond Hall, near Wickes, on 30 November 1708. Buried in his church of All Saints, he suffered a final indignity when the lengthy epitaph on his tombstone was defaced. The words &#145;Reverendus admodum Dominus&#146; (&#145;a master greatly to be respected&#146;) and praise of his military ability and literary success were erased&#151;Colcestrians believed&#151;by Compton.<h2>
<a name="Writingsandhistoricalsignificance"></a>Writings and historical significance</h2>Hickeringill used print culture as an alternative forum for articulating his resistance to episcopal ecclesiology. He was the author of some thirty individual tracts, for which he became notorious; the &#145;great scribbler of the nation&#146;. The odium he incurred, from the likes of the censor Sir Roger L'Estrange, was premised upon his skill at political disguise: throughout his pamphlets he intruded a critique of ecclesiological pretensions and practice in the form of protestant orthodoxy. <span class="italic">Naked Truth the Second Part</span> (1681), taking its name though not its theme from Bishop Herbert Croft's work, denounced all independent ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The church's power was defined by <i>regnum</i>, but its courts operated under the myth of a <i>jus divinum</i>: they were relics of popery. Hickeringill used his scholarly research into history and law to underpin a practicable assault on priestly authority. He taught, for example, that it was not &#145;sacrilege&#146; for parishioners to withhold tithes  (<span class="italic">Naked Truth</span>, 29&#150;30). Similar themes appeared in his <span class="italic">The Test or Tryal of the Goodness and Value of Spiritual Courts</span> (1683), where readers were urged to take no notice of their summons to the church court. At the pamphlet's end, to prevent extortion, appeared a &#145;just table&#146; of clerical fees with the slogan &#145;And no more!&#146;.<br>
<br>At the same time Hickeringill launched theological and dogmatic attacks on established church practice, exposing and undermining the cultural foundations of sacerdotal authority. <span class="italic">The Black Non-Conformist</span> (1682) revealed church ceremonial to be intimate with political power. There was a characteristic dose of rationalism: the historical appearance of bishops in the world was commensurate with the invention of ceremonies and eschatological supernaturalism. The central charge&#151;that English bishops were nonconformists, as practising popish ceremonies contrary to the king's ecclesiastical laws&#151;was extended in his <span class="italic">Ceremony-Monger</span> (1689). Prelates maintained the ignorance of Anglican congregations by imposing blind devotion and implicit faith. It was this concentration on the whiggish theme of &#145;priestcraft&#146; which distinguished his thinking from Reformation ecclesiology. The <span class="italic">Lay Elder</span> (1695) went beyond Erastianism, in suggesting that the distinction between the laity and a priestly caste itself was fraudulent, without historical or scriptural pedigree. Central to its priestcraft was the church's monopoly on interpreting scripture. In <span class="italic">Priestcraft; its Character and Consequences</span> (1705?) he undermined inerrant and inspired exegesis, by exposing the variations and contradictions of scriptural texts. For his description of the corruption of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> from primitive Christian purity through its duplicitous transmission by priests, he was charged by some with blasphemy. This notion of an overarching clerical conspiracy, mapped out over centuries, was a core theme in contemporary and later deist tracts. Hickeringill's bad press denotes a coarse appeal: in <span class="italic">Reformator Vapulans</span> (1691) Tom Brown portrayed him (negatively) as a popular oracle.<br>
<br>Hickeringill is an ambiguous figure: his position as conforming clergyman of the Church of England sits ill at ease with his conduct and writing. Contemporaries portrayed him as an opportunist who &#145;would change note or coat if it was possible to get into some fatter pastures&#146;  (<span class="italic">Observations on Meroz</span>, 1680, 26). In 1710 his writings were read out in open court during the state trial of Henry Sacheverell, as evidence that the church was in danger from a blasphemous coven of &#145;false brethren&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trial of Henry Sacheverell</span>, 216). In historiography his example has been used to illustrate the evolution of a tradition of interregnum puritan thought into deism after the Restoration  (Emerson, 396&#150;7). Hickeringill here represents a cadre of figures who, having lost their faith, marginalized a seam of radical thought that had previously been central to national discourse. Yet Hickeringill promoted his writings as remedial rather than revolutionary, and throughout his trials was concerned to preserve his status as a true and sincere clergymen. More recently it has been suggested that, rather than demonstrating the peripheral nature of heterodox beliefs, Hickeringill's conduct (parochially, in print, and in the courts) illustrates the difficulty for the ruling &eacute;lite in making routine the acts of conformity which symbolized religious order. Hickeringill used the authority of clerical office as a platform for both dissent, and the fabrication of order and compliance. Orthodoxy in Hickeringill's case was not a category of doctrinal authenticity that could be imposed by his superiors, but was attempted in a process of negotiation between the agencies of priest, laity, and ecclesiastical institution.<br>
