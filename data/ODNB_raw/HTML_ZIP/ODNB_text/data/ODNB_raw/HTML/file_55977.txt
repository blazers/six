<span class="headword">Willard,  Frances Elizabeth</span>  (1839&#150;1898), <span class="occ">social activist and suffragist</span>, was born on 28 September 1839 in Churchville, New York, the fourth of five children (only three of whom survived infancy) of Mary Thompson Hill (1805&#150;1892), a teacher, and Josiah Flint Willard (1805&#150;1868), a gentleman farmer and businessman. Willard, by all accounts plain in appearance, possessed a strong mind, a quick wit, and enormous personal charm, which won her many friends and admirers but few suitors. Her only serious romance, with Methodist minister and future president of Northwestern University Charles Fowler, ended in 1862 when Willard broke off their eight-month engagement. With this gesture Willard opted for a life of independence, work, and female companionship; her most intimate friendships were to be with women who provided her with the emotional, intellectual, and often financial support to pursue her reform work.<br>
<br>Descended on both sides from English puritans who emigrated to Massachusetts in the seventeenth century, Willard lived nearly all of her life in the mid-west (Oberlin, Ohio, 1841&#150;6; Janesville, Wisconsin, 1846&#150;58; Evanston, Illinois, 1858&#150;98), and fully imbibed the Methodism and Free Soil republicanism of her parents and neighbours. The monotony of life on the frontier sharpened Willard's awareness of the restrictions that gender placed on her activity and contributed to her intense desire for education and for &#145;useful&#146; intercourse with the world. Taught by her mother and by private tutors until she was sixteen, she eagerly attended the local schoolhouse in 1856, Milwaukee Female College in 1857, and North Western Female College in Evanston, Illinois, from which she graduated valedictorian in 1859. Her reading of John Stuart Mill and Margaret Fuller, together with an extended trip to Europe and the Middle East (1868&#150;70), cemented her commitment to the woman movement.<br>
<br>In 1870, after teaching for ten years at various secondary schools and women's colleges, Willard became president of the Evanston College for Ladies. When the school was merged with Northwestern University in 1873, however, Willard was demoted to dean by her former fianc&eacute;. Her autonomy seriously diminished, she resigned the following year and turned her considerable talents to the temperance crusade. Having served simultaneously as president of the Chicago Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and corresponding secretary of the National WCTU from 1874 to 1877, Willard was voted president of the latter in 1879, a position she held until her death. Her interest in temperance was an extension of her ongoing involvement in the woman movement. A member of Sorosis and the American Suffrage Association, Willard helped found the Association for the Advancement of Women (1873) and the International Council of Women (1888), and served as the first president of the National Council of Women. Irreproachably feminine, Willard avoided the taint of &#145;militancy&#146; and &#145;mannishness&#146; that plagued many suffragists by couching her pleas for the franchise in the language of domesticity. Under the banner of &#145;home protection&#146; Willard won respectability for the WCTU while subtly moving it away from the female realm of moral suasion and into the masculine world of politics. Willard prompted the WCTU to endorse a wide range of legislative reforms, including women's suffrage, and brought it into close co-operation with both the prohibition and the populist parties, though she failed in her efforts to fuse the two into a single, broad-based reform party. A gifted orator and a skilled organizer, Willard dramatically increased the size and strength of the WCTU. In 1891 she was elected president of the World WCTU. This position, along with her new-found friendship with Lady Henry Somerset, head of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA), brought her growing influence in British reform circles.<br>
<br>Between 1892 and 1897 Willard spent more than half her time in Britain, residing with Lady Henry at Eastnor Castle. In England Willard's conversion to Christian socialism (begun years earlier) was made complete. She joined the Fabian Society in 1893 and redoubled her commitment to state-sponsored reform. Though she continued to run both the National (American) and World WCTUs, Willard now also served as corresponding editor of the <span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span> and vice-president of the BWTA. In her efforts to assist Lady Henry move the BWTA away from its single-issue focus and toward the American &#145;do everything&#146; policy, Willard accompanied her on extended speaking tours, addressing large, enthusiastic crowds throughout Great Britain in support of temperance and other reform causes. Willard continued to be politically active in England: elected vice-president of the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1893, she worked closely with the Women's Liberal Federation and campaigned for temperance candidates of the Liberal Party in the 1895 elections. That same year she and Somerset took up yet another cause&#151;the plight of Armenian Christians. In May both women were on hand for a mass rally at London's St James's Hall, and that summer, while vacationing in France, they personally arranged for the medical treatment and resettlement of refugees they encountered in Marseilles.<br>
<br>Frances Willard died at the Royal Empire Hotel in New York on 17 February 1898, the victim of chronic pernicious anaemia; her remains were cremated in Chicago on 9 April. At the time of her death she was probably the best-known woman in America and had written twelve books (of which her autobiography, <span class="italic">Glimpses of Fifty Years</span>, 1889, is the most important) as well as numerous newspaper columns, and given thousands of speeches. Though generally revered by the English and American reform communities, Willard was often criticized by both the conservative and radical factions thereof. For the latter group, as for some scholars, Willard's reputation as a reformer had been tainted by her equivocal stand on racial equality, her support of immigration restriction, and her use of nativist language. But to her many friends and admirers she was an icon for reform; in 1905 the state of Illinois put her statue in the Capitol building at Washington, &#145;a tribute to the progress of women, as well as to her own greatness&#146;  (Strachey, 295).<br>
