<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maurice</span>, prince palatine of the Rhine  (1621&#150;1652), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and naval officer</span>, was the fourth son of Frederick V (1596&#150;1632), elector palatine of the Rhine, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8638/', "Elizabeth (1596&#150;1662)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14592/', "James VI and I of Great Britain")</script> and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5143/', "Charles I")</script>. Maurice was born in the castle of K&uuml;strin, on the Oder, on 16 January 1621 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. There George William, the elector of Brandenburg, the husband of Frederick's sister, had offered temporary refuge to Elizabeth on the flight of her family after the battle of the White Mountain, which two months earlier had ended their short-lived occupation of the Bohemian throne and residence in Prague. The new baby, baptized four days after his birth, was named after Maurice of Nassau (<i>d</i>. 1625), the hero of the Dutch resistance to Spain. He was sent to Berlin for safe keeping, while the family found protection in the Netherlands at the hands of the stadholder Frederick Henry, prince of Orange, Nassau's younger brother. Maurice stayed in the care of his Brandenburg kin in Berlin for seven years, and only joined his parents in Holland in 1628.<h2>
<a name="ExileandthebeginningoftheEnglishcivilwar"></a>Exile and the beginning of the English civil war</h2>In the years that followed the White Mountain the exiled palatines at their court at The Hague were the object of international protestant conspiracy and intermittent military activity, designed to recover their patrimony. After the death of Frederick V, Elizabeth (still styled queen of Bohemia) brought up a large family, which included her eldest surviving sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65815/', "Charles Lewis")</script> (elector after 1632), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24281/', "Rupert")</script>, and Maurice, and her youngest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37994/', "Sophia")</script>. While Rupert attracted attention by his angelic appearance and devilish ways, Maurice was distinguished, at least in his mother's eyes, only by his great height. With her family in exile, and their homeland under military occupation, Elizabeth had few illusions about their future prospects. She wrote to Archbishop William Laud in May 1637 that Maurice (then sixteen) would be joining the prince of Orange in the forthcoming campaign in Germany &#145;to learn that profession I believe he must live by&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637</i>, 138). Laud approved. She may also have wished him away from The Hague, where he had got into scrapes and had even fought a duel. With Rupert at the siege of Breda in 1637, he was commended for his courage. Military service was mixed with study at a French university (perhaps at Paris, as he was in the city in 1638&#150;9) and, possibly, Leiden. In 1640 he entered the Swedish general Banier's army. In spite of a pension provided by the English government, money was desperately short at The Hague, and Charles I, concerned for his sister's welfare, had lavishly entertained her two eldest sons at Whitehall. He now promised assistance to Maurice, to &#145;go to what army he pleaseth&#146;  (Bromley, 124).<br>
<br>But before Maurice could do so, the political crisis in the British Isles, and the uprising in Ulster, turned into civil war in all three kingdoms. When Charles I sent his queen to The Hague&#151;ostensibly to bring their daughter Mary to join her newly married husband, the son of the stadholder, but also to seek recruits, arms, and money from the Dutch&#151;Rupert and Maurice sprang to her side. They sailed to the north of England in August 1642 in time to appear at the raising of the royal standard, the signal for war, at Nottingham. No doubt arrangements had already been made for Rupert to be given command of his uncle's cavalry. For his part Maurice became colonel of a regiment of horse. As might be expected from his closeness to the king and his brother, the general, Maurice's regiment was a favoured unit. It was officered by professional soldiers and supported by wealthy gentlemen; many of its junior officers went on to high command in the war. It was an early and effective presence in the first skirmish, at Powick Bridge, near Worcester, on 23 September 1642. Maurice was wounded at this engagement. His regiment of four troops fought in Rupert's right wing of horse at Edgehill.<br>
<br>When the king's cavalry quartered around the royalist capital, Oxford, Maurice was called on to attend the council of war on six of the sixteen recorded meetings which took place between November 1642 and May 1643. The youngest of the royal counsellors (he was twenty-two), he did not impress the chancellor of the exchequer, twelve years older. Sir Edward Hyde later wrote that &#145;he was not qualified with parts of nature, and less with any acquired &hellip; He understood very little more of the war than to fight very stoutly when there was occasion&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.67). Maurice rode with his brother in the successful assault on Cirencester in February 1643. On 2 March that year he was given his first independent command, as general of horse and foot in Gloucestershire and south Wales, with the objective of shadowing Sir William Waller, whose rapid progress in the west was causing alarm at Oxford. His little army skirmished with Waller's larger force in the Forest of Dean (Little Dean, 11 April), and the following day, at Ripple Field, near Tewkesbury, inflicted some damage.<br>
<br>Maurice showed flair and skill in taking his forces across the Severn and outmanoeuvring his much more experienced opponent on this narrow site. His growing reputation further recruited his cavalry unit, as it was &#145;accounted the most active regiment in the army&#146;. One of his new officers reckoned that six months' service with it in summer 1643 &#145;gave me more proficiency as a soldier &hellip; than generally in the Low Countries in 4 or 5 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Military Memoirs</span>, 8). It was heavily involved in the unsuccessful attempt by the king and Oxford forces to relieve Reading at the end of April.<h2>
<a name="Thewarinthewestcountry"></a>The war in the west country</h2>William Seymour, marquess of Hertford, had been given supreme command of the western counties by the king at the beginning of the war, but had been forced to retire and go to Oxford. A fragment of his forces under Sir Ralph Hopton, however, had prospered in Cornwall, and had been encouraged by the king to march east. Maurice was to return to the west to assist him and supplement his largely infantry force with a strong body of horse, as well as foot and munitions, under Hertford's nominal command. Rupert had wanted his brother to command in chief, and intrigued with the king to this effect. But Hertford, although no soldier, was of great political importance in the west country; and Maurice consented to serve under him, as lieutenant-general. Unfortunately, as Hyde commented, there were in the king's camp &#145;no two men of more contrary natures and dispositions&#146;, and the basis was laid for further quarrels in the high command  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.67).<br>
<br>At the first skirmish with Waller's men at Chewton Mendip, near Wells, Somerset, in June 1643 the prince was wounded with &#145;two shrewd hurts in his head&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.87) and briefly taken prisoner. Although the Cornish stormed Waller's strong position at Lansdown on 5 July, the parliamentarian general was able to withdraw in good order, interrupt vital supplies, and pen Hopton's forces into Devizes. It was left to Maurice's cavalry to summon further help from Oxford, covering 44 miles in a desperate night ride. Wilmot, with fresh horse, brought Waller to battle at Roundway Down (13 July), shattered his wings of cavalry, and, joined with the Cornish issuing out of Devizes, put his foot to flight.<br>
<br>Bristol was left in a vulnerable position by Waller's defeat, in which some of the city garrison had been involved, and his army's withdrawal. The Oxford and western forces combined to storm the city on 26 July 1643. While Rupert's attack on the north-west sector of the defensive line was successful, Maurice's men and the Cornish suffered heavy casualties on the other side, which was strongly held. In the appointment of a governor of the conquered city the rivalry between the princes and Hertford erupted again. Hertford, as regional commander, nominated Hopton. Rupert claimed it for himself. The king confirmed this but made Hopton his deputy, and recalled Hertford to Oxford. Maurice was made sole general of the western forces.<br>
<br>With a largely infantry army Maurice followed the earl of Carnarvon's cavalry sweep through the Dorset countryside, which had been successful in persuading several formerly parliamentarian towns to make terms. But as Hopton had already noted, the Oxford horse and the Cornish foot did not mix well, and often came to blows. The prince's men were unpaid and disorderly; they now breached agreements made, and resorted to plunder. There was another quarrel, this time with Carnarvon, over a new appointment, and the earl resigned his commission. Maurice turned west to quicken the siege of Exeter. It surrendered on 4 September. Dartmouth fell to his troops in October, by which time most of the ports vital to hopes of supply from the continent were in the king's hands.<br>
<br>Only Plymouth remained of any significance, and Maurice was about to assist the siege there when he fell seriously ill. William Harvey and other royal physicians were sent to treat him and diagnosed &#145;the ordinary raging disease of the army, a slow fever with great dejection of strength&#146;  (Warburton, 2.307). As others in his entourage fell sick at the same time, the common contagion of that summer, a form of typhus, can be identified. &#145;The disease of the camp&#146; (<i>morbus campestris</i>) had decimated the armies of both sides in the Thames valley earlier. Maurice survived after a month's convalescence, but the siege of Plymouth was impeded. The town could be supplied from the sea, the defences were strong, and the garrison and townsmen resolute. Initial attacks were beaten off, and it also became clear that with the loss of so many of their old leaders the Cornish foot were less effective in this and the campaigns which followed.<br>
<br>The king's concern for his nephew was shown not only in the dispatch of royal doctors to his side, but in his plans for Maurice to marry a rich French heiress. &#145;Though Mars be now most in voag&#146;, he wrote in July 1643, &#145;yet Hymen may sometimes be remembyred&#146;  (Scott, 32). Rupert had spurned the favoured bride, and Charles I did not want to lose a lady whose wealth might be tapped for the royalist cause. But in spite of his uncle's pleas, Maurice remained unmarried.<h2>
<a name="Thesouthernandmarchercommands16441645"></a>The southern and marcher commands, 1644&#150;1645</h2>In the new year Maurice was commissioned to command all the southern counties except Hampshire, where Hopton's new army was active. His first task was to besiege Lyme Regis, which threatened the royalist supply lines from the western ports to Oxford and Bristol. With a considerable force of Cornish, Devon, and Irish foot, and twelve well-equipped siege guns, he opened the assault in April 1644. He built new batteries and poured shot, including &#145;hot iron&#146;, &#145;fire-arrows&#146;, and other forms of wildfire, into the little town, burning wooden houses, and barges in the harbour. But as with Plymouth, the besieged could be reinforced from the sea, sailors fought alongside the defenders, and Robert Blake conducted a skilful resistance. Several attacks were bloodily repulsed. In a wet season, and suffering heavy casualties, Maurice's troops wasted away. When forced to raise the siege, on the approach of Essex's army in mid-June, only half his force remained.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, when his army was reviewed by the king, marching west on the tail of Essex's army, at Crediton on 26 July 1644, it was 2500 horse and 5000 foot strong, with a full complement of general staff. Its commander now possessed a troop of mounted lifeguards. Maurice provided the advance guard of the royal forces that pursued the parliamentarians into Cornwall and eventually compelled their surrender. For the prince, however, the Lostwithiel victory was a turning point. He found that his Cornish troops would not leave the county to follow him east with the main Oxford army, and his attempts to surprise Taunton and Bridgwater, and drive in Waller's outposts, were all repulsed. He did have some success at the second battle of Newbury, where his much reduced force held Speen Hill against the odds, and by means of a complicated manoeuvre managed to draw off the guns, placed in Donnington Castle, after the battle.<br>
<br>The situation was altered with the appointment of Rupert as supreme commander in November 1644. Maurice replaced him as lieutenant-general in Wales and the marcher counties, without, however, the title of president. He set up his headquarters at Worcester in mid-January 1645, and energetically reorganized the royalist war effort in the region. He agreed articles of co-operation with the local commissioners, imposed a loyalty oath, and gathered recruits, munitions, and draught horses, in short supply at Oxford. But the local parliamentarians were increasingly confident and active; in meeting the threat to Chester the garrison of Shrewsbury was weakened, and it fell to a surprise assault. With it Maurice lost his base magazine. Other set-backs followed. Several of his leading supporters were killed or captured and their houses destroyed. His men deserted, and their conduct deteriorated to the extent that public opinion, formerly favourable, turned against them. The clubman movement in Worcestershire and Herefordshire began to take shape.<br>
<br>Maurice played a crucial role in spring 1645, however, in the preparations for the coming campaign. Most of the royalist-controlled munitions industry lay in the region he commanded, and Rupert joined his brother to make full use of it in March and April. Early in May they brought these essential supplies to Oxford, and provided a cavalry screen, to allow the king's army to take the field. Maurice was present at the sack of Leicester, and at the battle of Naseby on 14 June. With his regiment of horse and his own troop of lifeguards, he fought alongside his brother in the right wing of horse.<br>
<br>In the dispersal of the royal forces after this disaster Maurice returned to Worcester. A source hostile to him admitted that he was &#145;in himselfe cyvyll to all and wel beeloved of the cytyzens&#146;, though too tolerant of the undisciplined and disbanded soldiery who crowded into the city at this stage of the war  (P. Styles, <span class="italic">Studies in Seventeenth Century West Midlands History</span>, 229). The presence of the Scots army, its siege of Hereford, and its threat to Worcester put Maurice on the defensive. But with the aid of the king's remaining forces he raised the siege in mid-September, and brought 600&#150;700 horse to the king in north Wales after his defeat at Rowton Heath, outside Chester.<br>
<br>Rupert had surrendered Bristol on 10 September, however, much to the king's indignation. In dismissing his nephew instantly he compromised the position of Maurice and many other of Rupert's appointees. While Maurice had not been named in the wild rumours of plots that reached the ears of the king, and he received a friendly letter from Charles, he left his post and joined his brother. Together with about 200 followers they challenged their uncle at Newark, on 26 October 1645. Although a council of war cleared Rupert of any treachery in his surrender of the city, both brothers applied to parliament for passes to go abroad. In the interim they stayed at Oxford, and before the fall of the royal headquarters (June 1646) the king and Rupert were reconciled.<h2>
<a name="Waratsea"></a>War at sea</h2>The brothers separated on leaving England, Rupert travelling to France, Maurice returning to Holland. He took service with the prince of Orange's army in 1648, as he had before. The revolt of the English fleet altered prospects again for the exiled royalists in summer 1648, providing an opportunity for direct action against the parliamentarian authorities and the chance to win prizes for the impoverished court of Prince Charles at The Hague. Rupert and Maurice took the revolted ships (January 1649) to assist the royalists in Ireland; they raided commerce from their base at Kinsale, until Robert Blake's arrival with the main fleet and Oliver Cromwell's conquests on the mainland. They then accepted the protection of the king of Portugal, and sailed to Lisbon. But Blake followed and the brothers were forced to seek refuge in the Mediterranean, until&#151;in the hope of further booty&#151;they sailed to the coast of west Africa, where on 2 March 1652 Maurice raised his flag as vice-admiral on a captured English ship, renamed the <i>Defiance</i>. From there the brothers took their little privateering fleet, reduced to four ships, to the West Indies.<br>
<br>Disaster struck in mid-September. A hurricane caught the flotilla as it sailed close to the Virgin Islands, and continued for four days (13&#150;16 September). Only Rupert's flagship survived. Maurice and the rest disappeared on the second day of the storm, no doubt wrecked on one of the extensive reefs of Anegada or Sombrero Islands. Rumours persisted for years that he was still alive, possibly a prisoner of the Spanish on Puerto Rico. This myth was disposed of when Sir Robert Holmes, Rupert's follower and former subordinate of Maurice, questioned captured Spanish seamen with local knowledge before the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1664. They had heard of no survivors, and had seen among the wreckage on Puerto Rico's shores &#145;a great quantitie of pipestaves markt MP as all prince Maurice his cask[s] were&#146;  (Ollard, 125).<br>
<br>As a general and admiral Maurice was overshadowed by his elder brother, to whom he was very close, sharing his good and bad fortune unhesitatingly during the civil war and after. Like Rupert he was personally brave, and was loved and respected by his immediate followers as both a dashing cavalry leader and a good organizer. He was equally ignorant of English politics and lacking in diplomatic and debating skills, with the result that, despite his high connections, he contributed little to the overall direction of the war. Hyde accused him of being too familiar with his subordinates, which the frequent indiscipline of his troops might confirm, and not giving due respect to the leading figures of the court (Hyde no doubt included). He lacked his brother's intellectual and artistic interests. His failures before Plymouth and, particularly, Lyme lessened the reputation he had acquired earlier. His competent and popular government in the Welsh marches in 1645, however, indicated that he might have pursued a successful career had he lived to enjoy the restoration of the royalists' fortunes later.<br>
