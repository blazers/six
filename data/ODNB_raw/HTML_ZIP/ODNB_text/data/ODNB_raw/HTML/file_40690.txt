<span class="headword">Peterson,  John Charles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Jack Petersen]</span>  (1911&#150;1990), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born in Cardiff on 2 September 1911, the only son (there was also a daughter) of John Thomas Peterson, massage specialist, and his wife, Melinda Laura Rossiter. The family's name was Peterson, but Jack was known professionally as Petersen. It was a sporting family&#151;his father (whom the press called &#145;Pa&#146;) had trained south Wales boxers who were near-British champions. The younger Peterson was never a &#145;mountain&#146; fighter (a bare-knuckle boxer who fought illegally). He did well at school and was an enthusiastic boy scout. Not surprisingly, he took up amateur boxing, and by the age of eighteen had reached the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (ABA) finals at both middle and light heavyweight. In the following season he won Welsh titles at light heavy and heavyweight (1931), and the national ABA championships at the lighter weight.<br>
<br>Petersen immediately turned professional, managed by his father and backed by a syndicate of Welsh sportsmen. He won his first nine contests within the space of ten weeks at the stadium in Holborn, London. Cardiff was considered by professionals not to be a boxing city, though the Petersons lived in Whitchurch and Jack trained at St John Square, taking the train to go up for his Monday evening matches. Cardiff's Greyfriars Hall was soon used to display this stylish, hard punching boxing prospect to his home supporters, and they became vociferously excited when he rescued a contest by a knockout in the fifteenth round.<br>
<br>The British light heavyweight championship fell to Petersen at Holborn, and seven weeks later (July 1932), at Wimbledon stadium, he knocked out Reggie Meen, of Leicester, to become the British heavyweight champion, in his eighteenth professional contest, aged twenty. He was the first Welshman, and the youngest man, ever to win that title, and it was accomplished in ten months. The Cardiff press and the people of Wales glowed with pride. The light heavyweight division did not draw crowds to boxing matches, and though Petersen could still weigh 12 stones and 7 pounds he relinquished this title. As the champion at catchweights he became extraordinarily popular, partly because his opponents often outweighed him by 1 or 2 stones. He was an attacking boxer, a dark haired good-looking man, and the adjective &#145;gallant&#146; appeared frequently in boxing reporters' commentary. On cinema newsreels his modesty and pride in his own locality registered with the general public. Petersen was the most popular British boxer since Bombardier Billy Wells.<br>
<br>In 1933 an even younger man emerged as a contender. Jack Doyle, from co. Cork via the Irish Guards, had won his ten fights by knockouts within two rounds, and he and Petersen were matched at the White City stadium in July. The largest crowd at a boxing match in Britain at that time (some 30,000) assembled, only to watch Doyle repeatedly punch Petersen below the belt and be disqualified in the second round. Petersen ignored the fouls, did not go down, and honourably matched the bigger man blow for blow. In his next contest Petersen unexpectedly lost the British title to Len Harvey on points at the Royal Albert Hall (December 1933). It was his first defeat in twenty-five professional contests, and to a smaller, though exceptionally clever, man.<br>
<br>Six months later (June 1934) Petersen beat Harvey to regain this title and also win the heavyweight championship of the British empire, for which black men were allowed to box. One such contender, Larry Gains from Canada, was the next boxer that Petersen defeated. The man from Cardiff defended both championships successfully until August 1936, when he lost heavily to Ben Foord, a Leicester based white South African, who was qualified by residence for both titles. While champion for the second time, however, Petersen had suffered international reverses. In 1935 he boxed only twice, and was beaten both times by a strong, young, 14 stone heavyweight from Germany, Walter Neusel. Petersen retired from boxing in February 1937, at the early age of twenty-five, after losing bruisingly to Neusel for a third time.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Petersen was a physical training instructor in the Royal Air Force, and subsequently was heavily involved in Welsh affairs of the British Boxing Board of Control. In 1986 he became president of the board and was appointed OBE for his services to sport. He was also vice-chairman of the Sports Council for Wales. Petersen lifted the low prestige of British heavyweights in the inter-war years, and retired from boxing gracefully. In October 1935 he married Annie Elizabeth (Betty), daughter of Thomas Baker Williams, auctioneer, of Cardiff. His parents did not attend the long planned ceremony. &#145;Pa&#146; had been in his son's corner throughout his career, but the boxer&#150;manager relationship stopped after the second contest with Neusel, and Petersen managed himself for the last four matches of his six years' career. He died on 22 November 1990 at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, of cancer of the lung.<br>
