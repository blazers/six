<span class="headword">Beale,  Lionel Smith</span>  (1828&#150;1906), <span class="occ">physician and microscopist</span>, was born on 5 February 1828 at Bedford Street, Covent Garden, London, the only son of Lionel John Beale (1796&#150;1871), surgeon and first medical officer of health for St Martin-in-the-Fields, and Frances Smith Beale (1800&#150;1849), the third daughter of James Frost Sheppard. Of his three sisters, one was the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57882/', "Sarah Sophia Beale")</script>, and another, Ellen Brooker (1831&#150;1900), was married to the Shakespearian scholar William Watkiss Lloyd. After attending a private school in Highgate, Beale entered King's College School, London, at the age of nine, and began an association that lasted for almost the whole of his career. Apprenticed to an apothecary and surgeon in Islington at thirteen, Beale matriculated at the University of London with honours in chemistry and zoology in 1847; he then worked for two years as assistant to Henry Wentworth Acland in the Anatomical Museum at Oxford. He obtained his licence of the Society of Apothecaries in 1849 and in the same year was an inspector for the Board of Health, monitoring the cholera epidemic in Windsor. In 1850&#150;51 he was resident physician at King's College Hospital, and he graduated MB (London) in 1851. In 1859 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1892), only daughter of the Revd Peyton Blakiston MD FRS of St Leonards.<br>
<br>In 1852 Beale established a private laboratory in Carey Street and taught medical students physiological chemistry and normal and morbid anatomy, with special emphasis on the use of the microscope. In 1853, at the age of twenty-five, he succeeded Robert Bentley Todd as professor of physiology at King's College, being preferred to Thomas Henry Huxley among other candidates. For the first two years Beale shared the post with William Bowman (1816&#150;1892), who had been Todd's assistant, but he was subsequently sole professor until he resigned the post in 1869. He was then made physician to King's College Hospital and promoted to professor of medicine in 1876. He held both positions until ill health prompted his retirement in 1896, though he retained his links with King's, being nominated emeritus professor and honorary consulting physician. His lectures did not prepare students for passing examinations, but were valued for their scientific merit, and he was also highly regarded as a clinician, especially for speed and intuition in diagnosis. This skill was no doubt honed in the many examinations he made as medical adviser to the Clerical and Medical Assurance Company. He also acted from 1891 to 1904 as physician to the pensions commutation board and as government medical referee for England.<br>
<br>Beale's name became well known in medicine from the 1850s as a result of the popularity of his books on the clinical uses of microscopy. In 1854 he published <span class="italic">The Microscope and its Application to Clinical Medicine</span>, which set out the procedures of microscopy and showed clinicians how to use the instrument in diagnosis through the examination of urine, blood, tumours, and parasites. This manual went through four editions, the last of which was published in 1878. A companion volume, <span class="italic">How to Work with the Microscope</span>, was first published in 1857 and appeared in its fifth and final edition in 1880. Beale was ahead of his time as a pioneer of clinical pathology, as this medical specialism was not formally established in Britain until the 1920s.<br>
<br>Beale was a tireless researcher and a prolific writer on microscopy, histology, and chemical pathology. Initially he worked with William Bowman on the histology of renal structures and muscle fibres, but his range of interests soon grew, as is evident from his publications: <span class="italic">On some Points of the Anatomy of the Liver of Man and Vertebrate Animals</span> (1856), <span class="italic">On Urine, Urinary Deposits and Calculi, their Microscopical and Chemical Examination</span> (1861, and later editions with amended titles in 1863, 1869, and 1885). He edited the journal <span class="italic">Archives of Medicine</span> from 1857 to 1870. His last major work on clinical medicine appeared in 1880, entitled <span class="italic">On Slight Ailments, their Nature and Treatment</span>. In this volume, first delivered as a lecture series at King's College, Beale demonstrated his diagnostic acumen and therapeutic knowledge, including many of the wrinkles he had learnt from the previous generation of great clinicians.<br>
<br>To facilitate the differentiation of the component parts of cells and tissues, Beale developed various techniques of staining and fixing, most notably with his carmine solution. He also pioneered the practice of fixing tissues by injections to prevent alterations after death, and the use of high-power, oil-immersion magnification. Notable among his many novel observations was his identification of the pyriform nerve ganglion cells, now called &#145;Beale's cells&#146;. Beale never shied away from controversy in any field, as was evident in his long dispute with the German histologists Wilhelm K&uuml;hne and Rudolf von K&ouml;lliker over how nerve endings terminated in voluntary muscle. He illustrated all of his publications with his own excellent drawings, many of which were coloured. In the early 1860s his work on differential staining led him to distinguish two fundamentally different types of protoplasm&#151;&#145;germinal&#146; and &#145;formed&#146; matter&#151;and his ideas were first published as <span class="italic">On the Structure of the Simple Tissues of the Human Body</span>, in 1861. The German translation published in the following year caused controversy because of Beale's apparent departure from the dogma of cell theory. Much of the material was then reworked, though with more philosophical reflections, in a series of lectures at King's College in 1865, and published as <span class="italic">On the Structure and Growth of the Tissues, and on Life</span> (1865).<br>
<br>Beale undoubtedly did more than any other medical scientist of his generation to diffuse the new techniques and approaches of laboratory medicine, especially microscopy, to English-speaking audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, this aspect of his work was more influential than his original research and hypotheses on germ theories of disease, the nature of life, and the relations between science and religion.<br>
<br>In 1866 Beale's standing as a researcher led to an invitation from the royal commission on the cattle plague to make investigations of the histology of the epizootic disease that was decimating British livestock. In his report he claimed to have found the &#145;germs&#146; of the disease. However, he was unable to convince his peers of the truth of his observations, or of the explanation of the disease he proposed. Beale developed a germ theory of disease, in which the causative agents of disease were elements of degraded protoplasm not independent micro-organisms. His &#145;disease-germs&#146; were composed of what he called &#145;bioplasm&#146;, which he saw as elements of protoplasm that were more like fundamental units of life than cells. He argued that disease-germs arose within the human body, and he opposed the germ theories of Pasteur and others who implicated ferments, fungi, bacteria, parasites, and other &#145;external&#146; agents. His ideas on disease and germs were set out in his Radcliffe lectures at Oxford in 1868&#150;9, and published in two volumes in 1870: <span class="italic">Disease Germs, their Supposed Nature</span> and <span class="italic">Disease Germs, their Real Nature, an Original Investigation</span>. Both works were reissued in 1872 in a single volume, <span class="italic">Disease Germs, their Nature and Origin</span>. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Bioplasm, an Introduction to the Study of Physiology and Medicine</span>. Although soon regarded as misguided, Beale's objections to the eventually all-conquering bacterial germ theory were well grounded and in the early 1870s were widely cited by those who were opposed to Pasteur, Lister, Tyndall, and their followers.<br>
<br>Concurrent with his writing on germs Beale produced a cluster of linked publications, both biological and philosophical, on the nature of life. In 1870 he published <span class="italic">Protoplasm, or, Life Force and Matter</span>, and <span class="italic">The Mystery of Life</span>, in which he replied to the attack on vitalism mounted by Sir William Gull (1815&#150;1890) in the Harveian oration of that year. The religious influences on Beale's ideas and work were revealed in <span class="italic">Life Theories: their Influence on Religious Thought</span> (1871). All these publications advanced the claims of vitalism against what Beale saw as the growing influence of mechanistic materialism in biology, in medicine, and in culture more generally. Polemics against those who sought to reduce biology to physics and chemistry, and to deny that there was an absolute difference between living and non-living matter, became the major theme of Beale's writing. The boldness of his views stemmed from his conviction that modern biological knowledge supported the existence of a vital force in living organisms. Beale's standing in medical science and his prolific output should have made him a major figure in the nineteenth-century debate on science and religion, but he largely failed to engage his peers, despite the production of pamphlets with provocative titles such as <span class="italic">The New Materialism: Dictatorial Scientific Utterances and the Decline of Thought</span> (1885). In large part this was because the issue of materialism versus vitalism was seen to be largely metaphysical, it not having the same immediacy as, for example, the question of evolution had for relations between humankind and animals. Beale was convinced that there was no necessary conflict between science and faith, and set out the basis of his views in 1887 in a long essay, <span class="italic">Our Morality, and the Moral Question, Chiefly from the Medical Aspect</span>. After retirement Beale's convictions and penchant for polemics remained as strong as ever and he continued to rail against atheism, materialism agnosticism, monism, and free thought. His series of essays entitled <span class="italic">Vitality</span> (1898, 1899, and 1900) had more recognition and impact than his earlier writings.<br>
<br>Beale had two sons, the elder of whom died while the family was visiting Beale's lifelong friend Edward Thring (1821&#150;1887), headmaster of Uppingham School. This death deepened Beale's already close friendship with Thring, whose ideas were a major influence on Beale. The second son, Peyton Todd Bowman Beale MRCS, shared his father's interests in microscopy and publishing. An indefatigable worker, Beale took no real holiday after 1858. He eschewed alcohol and ate little meat. He was of moderate height and of sturdy build, with remarkable, abundant hair that remained brown until he was seventy. An enthusiastic gardener, he made his country home in Surrey at Weybridge, where he grew palms and Japanese plants, while in a small greenhouse at 61 Grosvenor Street, where he lived for forty-five years, he successfully grew orchids and other hothouse plants. In 1904 he left Weybridge, where he had taken a cottage in 1885 because of his wife's ill health, and moved to the house of his surviving son, 6 Bentinck Street, London. He died there on 28 March 1906 and was buried at Weybridge cemetery three days later.<br>
<br>Beale was elected a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1856 and became a fellow in 1859; he was a frequent examiner, a member of its council in 1877 and 1878, censor in 1881 and 1882, and curator of the museum from 1876 to 1888. In 1871 he was awarded the Baly gold medal for his physiological work and in 1875 he delivered the Lumleian lectures. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1857, Beale was Croonian lecturer in 1865; his address was entitled, &#145;The ultimate nerve fibres distributed to the muscles and some other tissues&#146;. He joined the Royal Microscopical Society in 1852, and was president in 1879 and 1880 and treasurer from 1881 to 1890.<br>
<br>Beale was a key figure in the development and diffusion of medical laboratory techniques in Britain from the 1850s and was a leading London physician for half a century. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century his ideas and commitments, especially his robust defence of vitalism, distanced him from his scientific peers and made him a focus of Christian opposition to scientific materialism.<br>
