</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coke, Sir  Edward</span>  (1552&#150;1634), <span class="occ">lawyer, legal writer, and politician</span>, was born on 1 February 1552 at Mileham, Norfolk, the only surviving son of Robert Coke (1513&#150;1561), lawyer and landowner of Mileham, and his wife, Winifred (<i>d</i>. 1569), daughter of William Knightley of Norwich. The families whose arms Coke quartered bore names long known in Norfolk and the Conisford ward of Norwich&#151;Coke, Pawe, Folcard, and Woodhouse&#151;while the Knightleys were prominent in Northamptonshire. Coke's family were minor gentry. Estimates of the family's income vary from &pound;40 per annum to &pound;300 per annum. Robert Coke was a rising man, a member of Lincoln's Inn and an attorney and servant to the Townshend family. He obtained a coat of arms during Mary Tudor's reign and served as JP during the reign of Elizabeth. The fact that Winifred Coke owned law books suggests something remarkable. Her connections aided her son. Her sister Elizabeth married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10469/', "Sir Thomas Gawdy")</script>, providing a useful link to that clan of lawyers and judges. Winifred's second husband, Robert Bozoun, of Whissonsett, Norfolk, was a man who drove hard bargains, even when dealing with Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper, and probably taught his stepson some of his hard-headedness.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Coke was probably a middle child, the only boy among seven sisters. After attending the grammar school in Norwich, he enrolled in 1567 as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge; he left at the end of 1570 without taking a degree. His years at Cambridge, significantly, were also the years of the vestiarian controversy&#151;protests by puritan dons and students which culminated in an attack by Thomas Cartwright on the governing structure of the Church of England. During Coke's last term the protests ended with a crackdown by John Whitgift, master of Trinity College, presaging decades of conflict between the church establishment and puritan dissidents. Coke was enmeshed in these stirs both professionally and personally. Whitgift, Coke's college tutor, later sent his old student a <span class="roman">Bible</span>, urging that he study the law of God. Cartwright was linked to Coke by marriage, being brother-in-law to one of his sisters.<br>
<br>When Coke set off for London, it is said that he left with the horse on which he rode, &pound;10 in his pocket, a rapier, and a diamond ring inscribed &#145;O prepare&#146;. He reached the capital on 21 January 1571 and that same day enrolled at Clifford's Inn, an inn of chancery. In 1572 he moved on from this minor institution to the more prominent Inner Temple. In a Temple moot Coke reportedly won acclaim for arguing &#145;the cook's case&#146;. This may be a stale pun on Coke's name, or, possibly, raised issues of parliamentary privilege: in 1532 the Inner Temple's cook had avoided arrest for debt because he also served Thomas Audley, speaker of the House of Commons. By early 1572 Coke was attending the courts in Westminster Hall. At some point during his student days he began keeping a commonplace book; in 1579, possibly in connection with his taking up a readership at Lyon's Inn, Coke began keeping detailed records of cases.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Coke was called to the bar on 20 April 1578. In 1579 he argued his first case in the court of king's bench, and won because he presented it well and it was thoroughly researched. Edward Cromwell, third Baron Cromwell, had sued a parson for defamation, and construing the governing statute Coke showed that opposing counsel had cited a badly translated and recent law French abridgement rather than the original Latin text. Soon afterwards Coke's role in arguing <i>Shelley's case</i> (1581) brought him wider acclaim. The case featured anomalous facts, an ingenious new reading of standard conveyancing terms, and a prominent family bitterly divided over religion. Likely selected by William Cecil, first Baron Burghley and lord treasurer, to protect royal interests, Coke pulled off an energetic, brilliant defensive action. He commemorated the victory by circulating manuscript copies of his arguments.<br>
<br>During the 1580s and 1590s Coke became one of the most prominent lawyers in England. His fame grew. In 1579&#150;80 he gave readings on the statute of 27 Edward I, <span class="italic">Finibus levatis</span>, and in 1592, at the Inner Temple, on the statute of uses. The readings in 1592 were cut short when plague broke out in London. To browse through any volume of Elizabethan law cases&#151;the reports ascribed to Sir George Croke, William Leonard, John Godbolt, or Sir Francis Moore&#151;is to find Coke representing a broad range of clients: country gentlemen, acquisitive parsons, Roman Catholic exiles, puritan dissidents, cockney publicans and City haberdashers, duellists, forgers, and burglars. He represented the Drapers' Company and other London guilds. The Howard family, struggling after the attainder of Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, were important clients; others included the family of the financier Sir Thomas Gresham and the sons of Sir Nicholas Bacon (1509&#150;1579)&#151;Sir Nathaniel (<i>d</i>. 1624) and Sir Nicholas Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1624).<br>
<br>Coke argued successfully many of the great cases to come before the bar during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I and these helped to refine legal doctrine. In <i>Chudleigh's case</i> (1594) he argued that the statute of uses categorically made all transfers &#145;to use&#146; subject to the rules on similar transfers made at law. In <i>Slade's case</i> (1602) he argued successfully that a plaintiff seeking payment for an unkept promise to pay money should be allowed to sue in assumpsit, rather than be required to bring an action for debt. Coke owed something of his success to his growing status. He married Bridget (1565&#150;1598), daughter of John Paston of Suffolk, on 13 August 1582. It was rumoured that this connection brought a dowry of &pound;30,000 and substantial amounts of property. Bridget Coke was a beautiful young woman and the couple set up house together at Huntingfield, Suffolk. They had seven sons and three daughters, including Anne (1585&#150;1671/2) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68095/', "Sadleir, Anne")</script>]. Coke became a notable figure in Norfolk's emerging county community&#151;though local politics became more volatile in the wake of the collapse of the Howard family and the growing conflict among the gentry leaders. He was appointed JP for Norfolk in 1586 and for Suffolk and Middlesex by 1593. As his practice grew and he travelled to cities and towns throughout England, including Coventry and London, his expertise was sought by various municipal governments: he was appointed recorder of Coventry in 1585, Norwich in 1586, London in 1591&#150;2, Orford in 1593, and Harwich by 1604.<h2>
<a name="Politicalconflictandstateoffice"></a>Political conflict and state office</h2>In the closing years of Elizabeth's reign, Norfolk displayed the political fracture lines that later divided the nation under the Stuarts. Ambitious gentlemen allied with the episcopal hierarchy, and armed with royal patents and militia commissions, challenged the traditional system of county government. They were resisted by country magistrates and puritans, on whose side Coke generally stood. When the authorities cracked down on puritan ministers at Bury St Edmunds, Coke represented pastor William Fleming and won his acquittal. In 1591, from a Norfolk quarter session bench, Coke and Francis Wyndham, justice of the common pleas, charged the grand jury that church courts could not force defendants to incriminate themselves. The statement resonates in Coke's later jurisprudence. In his native Launditch hundred, where his purchases made him a landowner to be reckoned with, he allied himself with puritan partisans&#151;squires who feuded over grazing rights and brought lawsuits over rectories. During the parliamentary election of 1592 Coke stood as MP in partnership with the austere religious Sir Nathaniel Bacon; a hard-fought campaign saw them elected as knights of the shire.<br>
<br>Coke's partnership with the Cecil family was close. It was to Burghley that he owed his appointments as solicitor-general on 16 June 1592 and attorney-general on 10 April 1594 over the claims of his rival Francis Bacon, who had been supported by Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. That conflict was part of the ongoing faction between Essex and the Cecils during the 1590s, being one of the biggest flashpoints. Coke was among the courtiers who profited from the wardships in which Burghley trafficked. He served as speaker of the House of Commons in 1593, the first parliament in which Sir Robert Cecil played a prominent part. Over the rest of the decade, as Norfolk politics became more volatile and popular, with mob violence and local rivalries (between supporters of the Cecils and Essex), Coke proved a shrewd electoral manager. As East Anglian boroughs put themselves into his pocket, allowing him to name the MPs that they returned, he dealt out seats to other Cecil partisans.<h2>
<a name="Cokeasattorneygeneral"></a>Coke as attorney-general</h2>In the early 1590s Coke advanced rapidly. In 1596 he became treasurer of the Inner Temple, and for years thereafter he had a strong influence on the inn, especially regarding admissions. As attorney-general he took part in the treason trials of Roderigo Lopez, Edward Squire, the Jesuits John Gerard and Henry Walpole, and Sir John Smyth. He badgered Essex after the earl's disastrous return from Ireland, and early in 1601, after Essex's frustrated <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, Coke presented the case which sent the one-time favourite to the scaffold. He also helped to orchestrate the government's running battle against Catholic infiltrators. On 15 November 1602, with Sir John Popham, chief justice of the queen's bench, and &#145;such men as we could trust&#146;, he staked out a corner of Gray's Inn Fields and personally arrested couriers from an Italian cardinal  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 261&#150;2). He questioned suspects in the Tower of London, and Gerard, who later escaped, provided a unique account of one such interrogation from the prisoner's point of view. Coke served the crown in this position for twelve years, prosecuting Sir Walter Ralegh and Henry Brooke, eleventh Baron Cobham, in 1603. There were mundane, lawyerly duties as well&#151;drafting pardons and engrossing commissions. However, if the treason prosecutions earned Coke prominence, the routine legal work finally brought him wealth. As attorney-general he collected fees for processing certain transactions, and the growing popularity of recourse to law made life particularly lucrative. During the 1590s, by Thomas Wilson's jaundiced but well-informed estimate, Coke's income rose from &pound;100 per annum to &pound;12,000 per annum, a figure comparable with those of the wealthiest men in the kingdom. In 1603, when James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth, a coronation windfall came Coke's way. John Aubrey had the story: Coke advised &#145;every man of estate (right or wrong) to sue-out a pardon&#146; from the incoming monarch. With a fee of &pound;5 for processing each pardon, Coke was said to have gained &pound;100,000 that year  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 162). However, this practice was rare and Aubrey may have exaggerated. In the heady days of James's arrival at Westminster, a knighthood followed, on 22 May.<br>
<br>In prosecuting Ralegh, the bitterest proceeding of his career, Coke was brutally vituperative. &#145;Thou viper&#146;, he called him, &#145;thou hast an English face, but a Spanish heart &hellip; thou art the most vile and execrable traitor that ever lived&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 2.7, 10, 25). Coke's language was so overwrought that Ralegh turned its force against the attorney-general, like a swordsman sidestepping the clumsy sweep of a halberd, and with fearless calm and quiet rejoinders redeemed his own reputation. Yet despite his eloquence and the lack of any real connection between the &#145;Main plot&#146;, with which he was charged, and the &#145;Bye plot&#146;, which Coke attributed to him, the fact remains that Ralegh could not explain why he had known so much and yet kept silent about Cobham's dubious political designs; and while proof of his guilt was weak, much stronger was the evidence that he had tried to conceal his own uncertain role. It was this part of the case that Coke hammered home, and, however inflammatory his rhetoric, he used language no more abusive than that with which Sir Thomas More had berated heretics. In other courtrooms, moreover&#151;notably in <i>Lord Paget's case</i> (1591)&#151;Coke argued just as forcefully on behalf of other enemies of the state.<br>
<br>By 1600 Coke was a very wealthy man with many possessions; he eventually owned at least 105 properties (manors, farms, rectories, advowsons, mills, and two mansions), most dotting the landscape in north-western Norfolk around Tittleshall and Holkham, with another cluster in Suffolk near Huntingfield. He was extremely acquisitive. A suit brought by Sir Francis Hubert, a hapless courtier and poet who blundered across his path, records the guile and audacity which the great lawyer could show. Coke acknowledged his tight-fistedness with a hint of self-mockery: when someone suggested that his high-living sons would spend his wealth faster than he had earned it, he replied, &#145;They cannot take more delight in the spending of it than I did in the getting of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 162). Yet very often he showed a neighbourly generosity. Bridget Coke's household account book, preserved at Holkham, records regular payment for favours and the exchange of presents&#151;salmon and venison traded back and forth between courtiers and her husband, 4<i>d</i>. was given to a boy who brought strawberries, and &pound;1 was provided for Coke's superannuated nurse.<br>
<br>Bridget Coke died on 27 June 1598. On 6 November Coke married Elizabeth, Lady Hatton (1578&#150;1646), daughter of Thomas Cecil, second Baron Burghley and first earl of Exeter, and his first wife, Dorothy, and widow of Sir William Hatton. By worldly standards it was a brilliant marriage. Elizabeth was a young widow, an heiress, a society beauty, and a niece of Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary. Held at night without banns or licence, the wedding gave rise to considerable speculation. The incredulity of the letter writer John Chamberlain was typical:<blockquote>the quenes atturney married the Lady Hatton, to the great admiration of all men, that after so many large and likely offers she sholde decline to a man of his qualitie, and the[y] will not beleve it was without a misterie. (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 29, 63)</blockquote>Certainly Lady Hatton had her own motives. She was twenty-six years younger than Coke, kept her former title, and sparred with her new husband over her jointure property. Gossips questioned her faithfulness. Yet if Coke and she were not wholly compatible, at least they were well matched. They had two daughters and over the years, as she herself matured from a society beauty into a royal confidante, she stalwartly supported her husband's standing at court.<h2>
<a name="Cokesjudicialcareer"></a>Coke's judicial career</h2>Coke was appointed chief justice of the court of common pleas on 30 June 1606, being created serjeant-at-law for the occasion, and chief justice of the king's bench on 25 October 1613. His tenure in these courts proved turbulent, being marked by friction with James and with two archbishops of Canterbury, Richard Bancroft and George Abbot. Early in James's reign, after the Hampton Court conference of 1604 had failed to resolve the tensions within the Church of England, the puritan leadership revived a strategy that had served them well in the 1590s. Facing prosecution by church courts and by the court of high commission&#151;tribunals which were perennially criticized, not unjustly, for handling sectaries more harshly than Roman Catholic recusants&#151;the puritans sued in common-law courts for writs of prohibition, orders enjoining prosecutions in such ecclesiastical tribunals. To enforce religious conformity, the commission compelled self-incrimination. Commissioners put defendants under oath in order to interrogate them about their religious principles as well as any plans further to reform the English church. (This was the notorious <i>ex officio</i> oath, so called because it was used in proceedings initiated directly by the commission.) The commission also meted out fines and prison terms. Critically, none of these powers was spelled out in the <span class="roman">Act of Supremacy</span> (1559), which authorized the commission. The commissioners claimed the powers because they were authorized by letters patent, as the statute had stipulated rather vaguely, commissions issued by crown officials. On the other side puritan lawyers argued that the commission's powers to interrogate, fine, and imprison were invalid, simply because these powers were not set forth in the statute. This set the common-law judges against the Church of England. To say that the commission's powers were limited by the statute was to say that the commission was subject to parliament and to the common-law judges who interpreted the law. More broadly, such arguments aligned judges and parliament against the crown. As a matter of constitutional logic, if the statute limited the powers which the king's commissions could grant, then parliament's authority on religious matters outweighed the king's.<br>
<br>In 1591, in <i>Cawdrey's case</i>, the judges ruled broadly in the high commission's favour&#151;so broadly that the case settled little. By the first years of James's reign, many prohibitions had issued from the common-law courts. Coke was only the most prominent of the many common lawyers who favoured such limitations on ecclesiastical tribunals. In 1604 he sought to restrict the commission's use of the oath <i>ex officio</i>. In October 1605 Bancroft presented to the king a list of complaints against the judges, the so-called &#145;articuli cleri&#146;. Over the next four years an indecisive series of conferences between the churchmen and the judges was held. In the meantime Coke and the judges continued to issue prohibitions, barring church-court prosecutions for churchyard altercations and vandalism, simony, and irregular sexual conduct. Coke was not opposed to the commission's existence, nor even categorically opposed to the use of the oath <i>ex officio</i>. Rather, he emphasized the need to limit the commission to serious, &#145;enormous&#146; cases, and to prevent misuse of the power to compel self-incrimination. None the less, compared to other judges, Coke circumscribed the commission's jurisdiction more closely, and ruled more frequently against self-incrimination. He argued, with transparent na&iuml;vety, that the oath <i>ex officio</i> so strongly tempted men to perjury (at the risk of their souls) that only the common law or statute should require its administration.<br>
<br>Two years after Coke's appointment to the bench the controversy deepened. One milestone was <i>Fuller's case</i> (1607). Nicholas Fuller, a lawyer, tried and failed to obtain a ruling in a test case that the high commission lacked the power to fine and imprison. Until the end, he was supported by the judges of both common pleas and king's bench. Even though he went to prison, he retained Coke's support. It had been determined in this litigation, Coke wrote, that &#145;when there is any question concerning what power or jurisdiction belongs to ecclesiastical judges &hellip; the determination of this belongs to the judges of the common law&#146;  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1600&#150;1659, 12.41). In November 1608, when James tried personally to resolve the feuds among his various courts of law, the controversy intensified. The king summoned the common-law judges to the council chamber in Whitehall Palace to explain their obstruction of the high commission. He informed the judges that he planned to decide the dispute among his courts; the judges were all his servants, he explained, and accordingly he could withdraw cases from their consideration and decide them himself. He questioned the decision. As Coke recalled the incident, he had told the king:<blockquote>God had endowed His Majesty with excellent science, and great endowments of nature; but his Majesty was not learned in the laws of his realm of England &hellip; which law is an act which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it. (ibid., 12.63, 65)</blockquote>Other sources say that Coke denounced church-court jurisdiction as &#145;foreign&#146;, and asserted that James was &#145;defended by his laws&#146;&#151;which triggered an angry reaction from the monarch, who was already furious about Coke's assertion that he could not participate in judicial proceedings:<blockquote>[the king] fell into that high indignation as the like was never known in him, looking and speaking fiercely with bended fist, offering to strike him, etc., which the Lord Coke perceiving fell flat on all four; humbly beseeching his majesty to take compassion on him and to pardon him. (Usher, &#145;James I&#146;, 669&#150;70)</blockquote>James continued to rage, until Cecil (now first earl of Salisbury), also knelt and asked pardon for his niece's husband.<br>
<br>As tempers cooled James, rather than issuing further prohibitions, instructed his judges to refer jurisdictional conflicts to him. They ignored this. In May 1609 the churchmen asked for a declaration regarding the high commission's powers. The judges responded by denying that the commission could rule on &#145;any thing concerning meum and tuum [such] as legacies, tithes, and pensions&#146;, and that it was restricted to heresy and &#145;enormous&#146; offences  (Usher, &#145;James I&#146;, 191). The May conference ended inconclusively and the skirmishing continued. William Crashawe, an Inner Temple preacher and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Coke's, was apprehended by the church authorities during the summer. In 1610 the Commons attacked one of Bancroft's closest allies, the civil lawyer John Cowell, an action traditionally ascribed to Coke. In May 1611 the judges were summoned before the privy council&#151;&#145;the first time&#146;, Coke told the privy councillors, &#145;that ever any judges of the realm have been questioned for delivering their opinion in matter of law according to their consciences in public and solemn arguments&#146;  (Usher, <span class="italic">High Commission</span>, 213). Coke reaffirmed the judges' stand that the commission could punish only &#145;enormous&#146; crimes, and that it could fine and imprison only heretics, schismatics, and incontinent priests. Then he flung out a final barb: that the commission's penalties had to be reasonable, which would have allowed the judges to test the reasonableness of every fine or gaol term. He later turned against the churchmen even this concession. When heresy proceedings were opened against Bartholomew Legate, Coke's argument that heresy could be investigated only by the high commission, and not by any bishop, threatened briefly to derail the prosecution.<br>
<br>Comparing two decisions which Coke wrote or published about this time, <i>Mackalley's case</i> (1611) and <i>Allan Ball's case</i> (1609), shows how opinions had hardened. It should be adjudged murder if a debtor killed a bailiff arresting him for debt, Coke affirmed, but only manslaughter if a householder killed a high-commission pursuivant trying to make an arrest for adultery. In autumn 1611 Abbot offered a final compromise by allowing eight judges (including Coke) to sit as commissioners. The new body convened with an odd interlude of legal pantomime. The judges, after entering the conference room, refused to take their oaths as commissioners, asserting that they had not seen the oath's terms. To show that they did not sit officially, the judges physically remained standing, and on this singular discordant note the controversy faded away.<br>
<br>In these same years the high commission was not the only court whose jurisdiction the common-law judges sought to circumscribe. Prohibitions were issued against the court of admiralty, the king's council of the north, the council in the marches of Wales, and virtually all prerogative courts. (All of these, like the church tribunals, were courts with which the common-law courts had long-standing rivalries.) In 1608 Coke and the judges ruled that commissions of inquiry held only limited powers. In 1610, while affirming the king's right to issue proclamations, Coke and the judges implied that such royal action needed validation by their own decision. In <i>Bagg's case</i> (1615), Coke announced that the king's bench had the authority &#145;to correct all lesser authorities in the realm&#146;, a claim which could be stretched to cover even the court of chancery  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1600&#150;1659, 11.93b, 98a).<br>
<br>However confrontational the course Coke steered as chief justice, the confrontations are not the entire story. He was not constantly at odds with the crown and with chancery; nor was he the only judge to infuriate James, or whom James bullied or suspended. Coke was frequently willing to favour the crown. <i>The prince's case</i> (1606) flattered royal finances, allowing James to recover many properties hastily sold off under Elizabeth. In <i>Calvin's case</i> (1608), Coke and the judges finessed a delicate political compromise over whether James's Scottish subjects, through his accession, had acquired the rights of English subjects. Coke threw James yet another favour in a lawsuit between the crown and the bishop of Bristol, ruling that benefices should pay taxes on their actual current values, not according to values discounted by decades of inflation&#151;a decision which enriched the crown at the church's expense.<br>
<br>In the long pauses between the explosive confrontations, Coke prospered. The period 1603&#150;25 saw Coke's children married into wealthy families. Coke himself bought up manors and profited every year in reputation and fortune, as volume after volume of his case reports was published. In 1614 Coke was named vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. He and his sons invested in the Virginia Company of London, profiting from the growth of English foreign trade. The storms of legend, so to speak, may also be considered the tempests of a balmy summer.<h2>
<a name="Kingsbenchandchancery"></a>King's bench and chancery</h2>In 1613, against his own will, Coke was advanced to chief justice of the king's bench. Bacon had proposed his promotion: the lower fees of this office, he argued, &#145;will be thought abroad a kind of discipline to him for opposing himself in the king's causes&#146;. Bacon also thought, however, that Coke would &#145;think himself near a privy councillor's place, and thereupon turn obsequious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.381). On 25 October Coke was sworn in as chief justice and on 4 November he was sworn in as a member of the privy council. This elevation did not make him obsequious.<br>
<br>For more than a century a quarrel had intermittently flared up between king's bench and chancery. King's bench judges asserted that lord chancellors could not interfere with the finality of their judgments, while lord chancellors just as often asserted their power to mitigate after a judgment had been made. Sir Thomas Fleming, chief justice, breathed new life into the dispute, and Coke, on his transfer to king's bench, inflamed the controversy. In <i>Heath v. Ridley</i> (1614) Coke announced that no court of equity could interfere with judgments given by common-law courts, and that any litigant who sought this would violate the statutes against <i>praemunire</i> (originally enacted to keep English litigants from appealing to papal courts, but which had more recently been used to rein in church tribunals). In <i>Glanvill v. Courtney</i> (1614), Coke and Thomas Egerton, first Baron Ellesmere and lord chancellor, clashed again. Richard Glanvill, a jeweller of dubious reputation, had won a king's bench judgment allowing him to collect on a transparently usurious contract. The debtor counter-sued in equity, alleging fraud; Ellesmere gaoled Glanvill when he failed to appear, prompting Coke to issue a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Another conflict, with more exalted parties, was the <i>Case of Magdalene College</i> (1614). This pitted Magdalene College, Cambridge (which was suing to reclaim a property in London), against Henry de Vere, eighteenth earl of Oxford, who had erected buildings worth more than &pound;10,000 on the site. When Coke ruled in the college's favour, the earl applied for relief to Ellesmere and won the appeal.<br>
<br>Within two years of his elevation, Coke stirred up the enmities which eventually brought him down. In 1614, during the Addled Parliament, he reversed precedent, and kept the judges from advising the House of Lords on points of law. He prevented the crown from appropriating the estate of Sir Thomas Sutton, ensuring that these went to endow Charterhouse School. A puritan parson in Somerset, Edward Peacham, was gaoled for writing a sermon which stressed God's judgments on wicked kings; Bacon polled the judges <i>seriatim</i> before the trial, asking each whether this were treason, but Coke growled at this &#145;auricular taking of opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.100). Coke would readily give out-of-court opinions to the crown&#151;he did so, in these same months, in another treason prosecution, <i>Owen's case</i>&#151;provided that the judges collectively considered the issues. What he resisted in <i>Peacham's case</i> was the king's attempt to exert pressure on individual judges. It is very likely (Coke thought so, among others) that Bacon's enmity ensured that the king remembered this resistance.<br>
<br>Coke's fall was postponed by the greatest scandal of James's reign, the prosecution of Robert and Frances Carr, earl and countess of Somerset, for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. During autumn 1615 this played out on the rostrum of Westminster Hall. Every motif of Jacobean melodrama was present: intrigue, adultery, love potions, poisons, the hint of witchcraft, and the suggestion of regicide. This was the last great investigation Coke directed and possibly the most intense, and he personally took more than 300 depositions. He had lost none of his prosecutor's harshness and sent several conspirators to the gallows while other defendants were still awaiting trial. Closely involved with the case, he is said to have voiced a suspicion he could not prove: that Somerset had procured the death of James's son Henry, prince of Wales, in 1612. Such overzealousness may have persuaded James to replace Coke with Bacon for the last phase of the proceedings. In spring 1616 hostilities resumed. Arrayed against Coke were the Church of England, chancery, and the crown&#151;and now, perhaps most fatally, the rising George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, to whom Coke had denied a choice patronage appointment. Glanvill, who also acted as a moneylender, returned to king's bench, seeking a <i>praemunire</i> indictment against the chancery officials who had hindered his earlier lawsuit. A grand jury was convened; Coke tried futilely to browbeat the jurors into issuing charges.<br>
<br>Meanwhile a new case arose which pitted common-law rights against episcopal privilege. James supplemented the income of John Overall, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, with the profits of an additional rectory, granted <i>in commendam</i>, only to see a landowner challenge his action. Coke's pivotal role in <i>Colt v. Glover</i>, also known as <i>The case of commendams</i> (1616), finally brought matters to a head. James wrote to the judges that the case concerned his power to govern the church, and asked that they stay proceedings until he decided whether further consultation between judges and churchmen was required. His position was strengthened by a writ which Bacon produced, <i>non procedendo rege inconsulto</i>, allowing the king to intervene in cases close to royal interests, which the attorney-general had tested in other cases. The judges countered unanimously, in a reply drafted probably by Coke, that the king's letter was &#145;contrary to law&#146; and that &#145;our oath in express words is that in case any letter comes to use contrary to law that we do nothing by such letters, but certify your Majesty thereof, and go forth to do the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC, 372). Responding forcefully, James summoned the judges before the privy council, tore up their letter, and demanded of each judge whether he would obey any future royal order. All the judges save Coke backed down. Asked what he would do, Coke answered, &#145;when that case should be, he would do that should be fit for a judge to do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Francis Bacon</span>, 5.367).<br>
<br>Armed with memoranda from Bacon and Ellesmere, both strong critics of Coke's objectionable rulings, James offered his chief justice one further chance to conform. Late in June Coke was suspended from the privy council&#151;charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with showing contempt for chancery and the crown. Meanwhile James ordered that Coke was not to ride on the summer assize circuit. Instead he was to censor his own law reports, &#145;wherein (as his majesty is informed) there be many exorbitant and extravagant opinions set down and published for positive and good law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.14). Coke complied, albeit superficially. He acceded to James's views on the commendams lawsuit; more than that he would not do. On 2 October 1616, after perusing his <span class="italic">Reports</span>, Coke reported that he had found only five trifling errors. This was defiance, and James took up the gauntlet. He demanded that his obstinate chief justice explain five of his most dangerous conceits. When Coke refused this final opportunity to recant, yielding nothing, the king acted. On 16 November Coke was removed from the bench. It was said, Chamberlain wrote, that &#145;four p's&#146; had overthrown the chief justice: &#145;that is, pride, prohibitions, praemunire, and prerogative&#146;  (ibid., 2.34).<br>
<br>Within six weeks Coke had bought back royal favour. He arranged a match between his fourteen-year-old daughter, Frances, and Sir John Villiers, Buckingham's older brother (apparently a gentle lunatic). Lady Hatton opposed the marriage. In July 1617 she carried the girl out of her husband's reach, and he pursued her. Both sides obtained warrants and exchanged charges in the court of Star Chamber, but the struggle was lawless: troops of bully-boys were hired, pistols issued to servants, and two doors smashed in with a heavy piece of timber. As his servants moved forward with their makeshift battering ram, Coke is said to have dispersed his wife's men by shouting that it would be justifiable homicide if his men killed any of them, but murder if he or his own people were killed. Little evidence supports this or the darker allegation that he tied Frances to the bedposts and whipped her until she agreed to the marriage. In September 1617, after final haggling&#151;Coke refused to buy favour too dearly&#151;the wedding was celebrated. The marriage was not happy, providing twenty years of scandal and doing nothing to improve Coke's reputation. Lady Hatton, who briefly suffered confinement at her husband's instigation, never willingly suffered his presence again. Coke returned to the privy council on 28 September, the day before Frances's wedding, though he was not restored to the judiciary. In winter 1619&#150;20, when chronic illness kept Bacon from sitting in the Star Chamber, other privy councillors treated Coke as the senior member. Coke chaired the committee which ran the treasury. He sat in judgment on Thomas and Catherine Howard, earl and countess of Suffolk, and on Sir Henry Yelverton. Although he seems never to have returned to the courtroom, let alone to the bench, he proved too useful to be ignored.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandculturalinterests"></a>Personality and cultural interests</h2>Coke showed an unusual blend of energy, obstinacy, bookishness, and vanity. &#145;He would play with his case as a cat would with a mouse, and be so fulsomely pedantic that a schoolboy would nauseate at it&#146;, John Aubrey wrote. &#145;But when he comes to matter of law, all acknowledge him to be admirable &hellip; He was of wonderful painstaking, as appears by his writings. He was short-sighted but never used spectacles to his dying day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 163). An anonymous puritan, who knew Coke well (possibly the young Joseph Hall), warned him in <span class="italic">An Expostulation to the Lord Coke</span> against loving his own words, preferring books to men, and patronizing sycophants. The other side of Coke's vanity was a ferocious energy. Not only did he regularly rise at three o'clock in the morning; he posted letters from the Tower of London at three in the morning. At the Northampton assizes in 1606 he spoke for two and a half hours. With this energy went a hard-edged inverse snobbery. Near the end of the great lawyer's career, after his prosecutions of Essex, Ralegh, Somerset, Bacon, and Lionel Cranfield, first earl of Middlesex, Sir Edward Conway quipped that Coke would die if he could not help ruin a great man at least once every seven years. &#145;Succedo arduus Eduardus cucus&#146;, runs an anagram penned in one of Coke's early law books: &#145;I Edward Coke succeed through hard work&#146;, or, &#145;To be Edward Coke is to work hard&#146;  (Hassall, 33). This was the most fitting motto Coke ever chose for himself. Neither of his two official mottos, <i>Prudens qui patiens</i> (&#145;It is prudent to be patient&#146;), which he copied from Burghley, or <i>Lex est tutissima cassis</i> (&#145;Law is the surest protection&#146;), which he took when created serjeant-at-law, offer as sharply drawn a self-portrait.<br>
<br>Coke was a handsome man, with something of the lawyer's vanity and pomposity. &#145;The jewel of his mind was put into a fair case, a beautiful body, with a comely countenance&#146;, Thomas Fuller flatteringly wrote, &#145;a case which he did wipe and keep clean, delighting in good clothes well worn, and being wont to say &#147;that the outward neatness of our bodies might be a monitor of purity to our souls&#148;&#146;  (Fuller, 415). A jibe from Bacon suggests that Coke gained weight as he prospered (neither the judge nor the philosopher took a lofty tone in comments about each other). Coke's portraits show that he had brown hair and a well-kept beard, with dark, penetrating eyes. They suggest a good deal of self-assurance and calculation.<br>
<br>Coke lived his life on the cusp between the international aspirations of Renaissance learning&#151;extensive in its breadth, Latin in its ancestry&#151;and the insular, assertive traditions of the English common law. When he quoted the <span class="roman">Bible</span> he generally quoted the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>. It was in Latin that he composed serious verses&#151;to commemorate his son's wedding, or to while away confinement in the Tower. He knew his classical authors well: Virgil, Cicero, Tacitus, Ovid, Sallust, Seneca. But while Coke knew Justinian's codes, he resisted the codification of the judges' wisdom. He challenged the civil law of the continent by reporting cases in the peculiar professional dialect, law French, of the English bar, and by using English for his institutional writings. He wrote:<blockquote>Our English language is as copious and significant, and as able to express any thing in as few and as apt words, as any other native language &hellip; And (to speak what we think) we would derive from the Conqueror as little as we could. (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Third Institute</span>, &#145;Proeme&#146;, 1642&#150;4)</blockquote>Deriving little from William the Conqueror&#151;that is, finding the source of law in popular custom and judicial wisdom rather than in royal command&#151;Coke gave mythic dimensions to the common law by tracing legal doctrines into dim antiquity. Following Sir John Fortescue he claimed that the unwritten law of England had operated unchanged since the days of the druids. He traced parliament to Anglo-Saxon days, possibly back to the <i>conventus</i> described by Tacitus, and he held that the rule against distraining beasts of the plough had been established by the mythical Celtic lawgiver Dunwallo Molmutius. This penchant for anachronism, common among Tudor lawyers, has been derided as a pathology of &#145;the common-law mind&#146;. Yet Coke's myth-making was rooted less in mentality than in ideology. Like the Tudor divines who unearthed proofs that the Church of England was as ancient as the Church of Rome and preceded the establishment of papal authority, the lawyers' efforts to trace their discipline to a glorious British past reflected nationalist sentiment; the venerability of the common law reflected the heroic character of the English people. It was also a useful weapon against the encroachment of civil law. Fittingly, it was from Geoffrey Chaucer that Coke took his favourite judicial saying: &#145;out of the old fields, as men saith, cometh at this new corne fro yere to yere&#146;.<br>
<br>Despite his reckless conclusions, Coke was a diligent searcher of the historical record. He collected manuscripts, trying to obtain the best possible versions and exchanging them with Sir Robert Cotton. Some of his historical manuscripts had been among those collected by Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, and Coke drew on the knowledge of prominent members of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries, Joseph Holland, Francis Tate, and Arthur Agard. Coke never questioned how the <i>feodum</i> of English law might relate to the <i>feodum</i> of the continent; but Sir Henry Spelman, who did make this connection&#151;and so, as the legal historian Frederic Maitland put it, introduced the feudal system to England&#151;was a neighbour and friend. Another member of Coke's circle was Sir John Davies, one of the shrewdest historians of his day. In this intellectual milieu Coke may have been something of a savant.<br>
<br>Coke's relationship with literature has been double-edged. He denigrated players and rhyming poets. In 1606 he advised a Norfolk grand jury that they might properly drive out of the shire &#145;stage players, wherewith I find the country much troubled&#146;&#151;but in the same speech borrowed from <span class="italic">The Summoning of Everyman</span> and stole from Shakespeare the famous patriotic speech of John of Gaunt in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">The Lord Coke his Speech and Charge</span>, 1607, sig. H2). Coke even alluded, very specifically, to <span class="italic">The Poetaster</span> by Ben Jonson, who returned the compliment with verses suggesting that Coke's rise owed everything to talent and industry. To James's great merriment the Cambridge production of <span class="italic">Ignoramus</span> (1615) broadly ridiculed both the common law and the chief justice. Coke's conflict with Ellesmere and the king found its way into the satirical twists of Jacobean drama (<span class="italic">The Widow's Tears</span>, by George Chapman, and <span class="italic">The Old Law</span>, by Thomas Middleton). For a flattering literary portrait, the chief justice had to wait three centuries, for the later cantos of Ezra Pound (particularly the &#145;Rock-drill&#146; and &#145;Thrones&#146; sections, published in the 1950s). In Pound's verses, which recite snippets of the <span class="italic">Institutes</span> to denounce usury and extol the people's ancient liberties, Coke appears alongside John Adams and classical Chinese mandarins, as a statesman and jurisprudent.<h2>
<a name="Puritanconnections"></a>Puritan connections</h2>Across fifty years Coke befriended the puritans of England. The connections began with his own family. His cousin and ally in the Commons, Sir Richard Knightley of Fawsley, Northamptonshire, sheltered the Marprelate press. Even more important was Coke's sister Anne. She married into the Stubbe family, becoming sister-in-law to both Thomas Cartwright and John Stubbe. She was prominent among the sectaries of Norfolk, and criticized Cartwright vigorously for arguing that churches should be led by learned preachers rather than steered by the voice of the congregation.<br>
<br>Coke's religious beliefs were conventional. His household met for daily prayer, but he obtained a licence to eat meat himself on fast days. A deathbed prayer ascribed to him recites blocks of the Church of England liturgy. In churches under his influence (Weasenham in Norfolk, and Huntingfield and Bramfield in Suffolk), medieval decorations and rood screens survived intact. He could parrot the official line that Brownists were nearly as dangerous as papists. Nevertheless, inconspicuously but consistently, he favoured puritans. He was among the Inner Temple lawyers who took notes of the sermons preached by Walter Travers. He gave livings to ministers who avoided wearing surplices, omitted ceremonies, and taught in unlicensed schools: Robert Gold at Cokely in Suffolk, Edmund Stubbe at Huntingfield, and Coke's brother-in-law George Leedes at Holt. In 1600 he endorsed William Playfair as master of Clare College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Coke attracted sermon dedications from godly divines such as Richard Rogers, Miles Mosse, and the literary executors of Thomas Perkins. The author of <span class="italic">A Godly Sermon Preached at Tittleshall</span> (1600), who dedicated this work to Coke, showed a puritan's concern with politics and disdain for chivalric romances. Coke's library at Holkham was filled with similar works: books by Hugh Broughton, William Crashawe, Samuel Hieron, Andrew Willet, and Thomas Brightman. Among his trusted servants in Norfolk were the Skippon family of Weasenham. Philip Skippon, Christian apologist and ramrod of the New Model Army, grew up on the edge of Coke's household. Coke's daughter Bridget chose John Milton to tutor her son Cyriack, and is said to have paid for the schooling of Andrew Marvell. Perhaps the most vital connection came late in Coke's career, between the elderly privy councillor and the young Roger Williams, who, long before he argued against religious persecution in England and made religious toleration a political reality in Rhode Island, took shorthand notes for Coke in the Star Chamber.<h2>
<a name="Cokeasjudgeandjurisprudent"></a>Coke as judge and jurisprudent</h2>Coke defined law as the &#145;artificial reason&#146; of the judges, a professional consensus based on training and experience. Paying lip service to the view that the common law was custom, he was in fact a great believer in judicial action, who viewed the practice of law as an art: &#145;Reason is the life of the law&#146;, he wrote, &#145;nay the common law itself is nothing else but reason; which is to be understood of an artificial perfection of reason, gotten by long study, observation and experience, and not of every man's natural reason.&#146; The common law of England, he continued, had &#145;been fined and refined by an infinite succession of grave and learned men, and by long experience grown to such a perfection, for the government of this realm&#146;  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">The First Part of the Institutes</span>, 1628, 97b). This view of law was grounded in the traditions of classical rhetoric, learning drilled into Coke and every other lawyer of his generation, in the grammar schools of Tudor England. It equated the good and the true with the persuasive and the public-spirited. Coke maintained (following Cicero and Quintilian) that, &#145;I never saw any man of excellent judgment in these laws, but was withall &hellip; honest, faithful, and virtuous&#146;  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1600&#150;1659, 2, preface). He asserted that the common law was inerrantly &#145;certain&#146;, in other words, reliable  (ibid., 4, preface).<br>
<br>Part of this vision was conservative. Coke asserted that judges found law and did not make it. He felt that legal traditions were rich enough to solve any question facing a court. He felt that legal rules were best exemplified in individual cases and set great store by precedent, which he saw as the unique quality of common law. In <i>Calvin's case</i> he argued that medieval precedents on the rights of Edward III's Gascon subjects defined the rights of James's Scottish subjects. By contrast Ellesmere suggested frankly that, when new issues arose, courts made new law in resolving them. Rather than asking whether legal fictions, in order to ensure precedent, might be a cancer on the legal system, Coke unhesitatingly approved their use. In cases such as <i>Rockwood v. Feasar</i> (1591), he proved his magisterial ability, as George Croke admiringly put it, to devise a plea to alter the trial. His faith in the professional wisdom of bench and bar did not go unchallenged. Thomas Hobbes, most notably, argued that the law should be rooted in common reason rather than legal arcana. None the less, Coke's focus on the craft of lawyering&#151;the etiquette of beheading a peer, the details of executing a will&#151;emphasized the careful practice and broad learning necessary to put law into action.<br>
<br>Coke consistently held to the Tudor vision of the realm as a commonwealth, distinguishing public good from private gain. As a lawyer and judge&#151;in cases such as <i>Davenant v. Hurdis</i> (1598), <i>Tooley's case</i> (1613), and the notable <i>Taylors of Ipswich</i> (1614)&#151;he supported artisans seeking to follow their trades over opposition from craft guilds. In 1607, in the Star Chamber, Coke ruled in favour of a west country apothecary who faced hostility from the medical establishment. He mocked purveyance and wanted to abolish certain feudal tenures. He opposed the sale of office; the positions which he had held, he boasted, had all been acquired <i>sine prece et pretio</i>, without begging or bribery  (<span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC, 374). In tithe litigation he led the judges who broke with medieval practice, forbidding the tithes on products of the earth (stone, brick, lead, coal, peat) and profits earned on sales of real estate and beer. He denounced torture, though he had signed warrants for torture in the past, including authorizing its use on Bartholomew Steer. He brooded over the number of felons who every year were sent to the gallows, and hoped that &#145;justice sever&eacute; puniens&#146; might be replaced with &#145;preventing justice&#146;, instruction in trade, and religion  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, 1642&#150;4, 3.243).<h2>
<a name="Cokeandjudicialreview"></a>Coke and judicial review</h2>&#145;Nothing that is contrary to reason, is consonant to law&#146;, Coke wrote  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">The First Part of the Institutes</span>, 1628, 56b). While such assertions dated back to Henry of Bratton, Coke and his colleagues pursued the principle with new-found energy. Defining law as the judges' reason allowed Tudor courts to review manorial customs, medieval precedents, municipal ordinances, and even acts of parliament. What they found reasonable, the judges approved; whatever failed to satisfy them, they struck down. Coke was willing to extract principles from yearbook jurisprudence, supplying new rules which the common law found indispensable. He preferred such reform by judicial action to reform by legislation. He looked down on statutes &#145;overladen with provisoes and additions&#146;, or &#145;penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law&#146; (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1600&#150;1659, 2, preface; 4, preface). Despite his reputation as a master of the unwritten law, Coke worked routinely and comfortably with statutes. The law had three parts, he wrote&#151;common law, statute, and custom&#151;and he chose to report cases which elucidated important statutes.<br>
<br>In 1610, in <i>Bonham's case</i>, Coke laid the foundations for judicial review of legislation, allowing judges to strike down statutes. Thomas Bonham was a doctor practising in London, who, denied admission by the College of Physicians, was gaoled and fined when he continued to work. The court of common pleas, led by Coke, freed Bonham and fined the college. The relevant statute, Coke explained, improperly made the college a judge of cases in which it held an interest:<blockquote>And it appears in our books, that in many cases, the common law will control acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void; for when an act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it, and adjudge such act to be void. (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1600&#150;1659, 8.107a, 117b)</blockquote>With this sentence Coke broke new ground: in the scattered medieval precedents which supported his ruling, judges might have ignored the effect of a statute, but &#145;to this fact Coke [had] really added an explanation and a theory all his own&#146;  (T. F. Plucknett, &#145;<i>Bonham's case</i> and judicial review&#146;, <span class="italic">Harvard Law Review</span>, 40, 1927, 36). Pressed to recant this ruling, Coke never explicitly did so; neither did he expressly reaffirm it, nor did he ever clearly state which he held to be the highest constitutional authority&#151;the court of king's bench or the high court of parliament. However, in his <span class="italic">Fourth Institutes</span> he may have backed down somewhat. English courts soon abandoned the theory of judicial review, but in colonial Massachusetts and Virginia <i>Bonham's case</i> was cited as precedent for striking down unjust laws, and lawyers in the United States have not hesitated to see Coke's decision as a forerunner of <i>Marbury v. Madison</i> (1803), which asserted it for American federal courts.<h2>
<a name="Cokesserviceinparliament"></a>Coke's service in parliament</h2>Coke's experience as a lawyer and judge was matched by his record as a parliamentarian. He sat in the parliaments of 1589 and 1593 as MP for Aldeburgh, Suffolk, and for Norfolk respectively, serving as speaker of the Commons during the latter session. He markedly tightened procedure. Absent from the Commons for nearly thirty years, he was returned for four parliaments in the 1620s: for Liskeard, Cornwall, in 1621, Coventry in 1624, Norfolk in 1625, and Buckinghamshire in 1628. In these assemblies he figured as one of the Commons' most prominent leaders. Always an oracle, Coke ended as something of a statesman, moving into opposition to the crown&#151;ambivalently and intermittently, but ineluctably. Against the background of a trade depression Coke attacked bills of conformity (chancery orders which settled debts at a discount) and abuses within the legal system, seeking to define the courts' jurisdiction and to streamline proceedings in the exchequer and the court of wards. On trade and commerce, another area in which he hammered on grievances, his outlook was quintessentially mercantilist. He sought to keep wool prices high, rather than promote free trade; he attacked monopolies and trading companies' privileges, but intimated that trade was an area in which government policy had a role.<br>
<br>His fondness for denouncing abuses and attacking scapegoats made it easy for Coke to lead the Commons in its new-found vogue for impeaching state officers. He supported this effort by supplying medieval precedents and conducting crucial hearings himself&#151;gradually distancing himself from royal interests. This zealousness drew from the king a pointed criticism, made in a speech to the Lords:<blockquote>For though Sir Edward Coke be very busy and be called the Father of the Law and the Commons house have divers young lawyers in it, yet all is not law that they say, and I could wish, nay I have told Sir Edward Coke, that he [should] bring precedents [from] good kings' times &hellip; [and not from the reigns of] silly weak kings [such as Henry VI]. (Zaller, 69)</blockquote>James concluded ominously, &#145;I hope in his vouching precedents to compare my actions to usurpers or tyrants' times you will punish him&#146;  (ibid.). This warning put at risk Coke's liberty and fortune, and possibly more. Yet within weeks he had snatched a great deal of gratification from the jaws of his own potential ruin. From corrupt patentees like Sir Giles Mompesson, the Commons turned relentlessly upon the man who had approved their patents&#151;Francis Bacon, first Baron Verulam and Viscount St Albans, the lord chancellor&#151;bringing well-founded charges of bribery. Coke headed the committee which investigated Bacon and fended off compromises which might have saved his rival. He must also have been active behind the scenes: some unknown individual had painstakingly gathered the evidence which the Commons now so quickly and devastatingly threw into public view, and the thoroughness of the inquiry betrayed a master's hand. Coke remained vulnerable himself to the rough power-plays of impeachment politics, even after Bacon resigned his office and was sent to the Tower. James long retained hopes that the Commons would vote him what he sought, and he continued to draw on Coke's legal knowledge. In autumn 1621, while the Commons continued to sit, James relied on Coke in a case involving Archbishop Abbot. Abbot had accidentally killed a gamekeeper while hunting, and, under scrutiny for shedding guiltless blood, was cleared by Coke's opinion that it was lawful for a bishop to hunt&#151;implicit, Coke explained, in the old rule that a bishop's pack of hunting dogs escheated to the crown. Yet over the course of the autumn James's exasperation with the Commons and with his uncompliant privy councillor continued to grow. In November, with royal support, two patentees, John Lepton and Henry Goldsmith, prepared their own attack on Coke: a long list of alleged misconduct from his days as a judge. Coke parried this initiative, but James was ready to take stronger measures himself. At the end of the year, after Coke and the Commons had asserted the right to debate and legislate on all matters concerning the commonwealth, James struck. On 27 December, eight halberdiers marched Coke off to the Tower, and shortly thereafter the king dissolved parliament. Coke spent most of 1622 in confinement, first in the Tower and later under house arrest at his mansion in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. He consoled himself by writing Latin verses which mentioned the lions roaring in the Tower precincts and wishing himself back at his house in Godwick, Norfolk.<br>
<br>In the parliament of 1624 Coke was returned for Coventry. The king planned to keep him out of the way by sending him on a commission to Ireland, but last-minute lobbying by Charles, prince of Wales, changed James's mind. Shifts in foreign policy had reduced frictions between crown and Commons and also contributed to the king's decision. Complaints were once more aired, but this time hopefully, and Coke chaired the committee on grievances. Two bills he had sponsored but seen voted down in 1621, on monopolies and bankruptcy reform, were now enacted. Some tensions remained in one bill that he sponsored, a limitations measure which would have protected against &#145;concealers&#146; (and the crown) all land already held for more than sixty years. Concealers were typically vilified as minions of a corrupt and venal court; Coke played the country gentleman memorably in denouncing them as &#145;viperous vermin&#146; and &#145;caterpillars of the commonwealth&#146;  (White, 72&#150;6). Yet he worked well in this parliament with Buckingham. When the duke spoke of war with Spain, Coke seconded him&#151;perhaps outdid him. When the duke moved to bring down Cranfield, it was Coke who marshalled the evidence and managed proceedings in the Commons.<br>
<br>The parliament of 1625, the first convened by Charles I, saw a sea change in Coke's role. No longer was he the energetic committee-man who argued the details of countless bills. Instead, linked with Sir John Eliot and Sir Edwin Sandys in a loose opposition group, he pressed a series of initiatives uncongenial to the new king, criticizing Charles's foreign policy, challenging his decisions on religion, and hesitating to grant financial support. Coke clearly thought that the king's expenses could be trimmed. In a major speech on 4 August 1625 he analysed the income and expenses of the crown, making recommendations on both sides. He argued that the king should ordinarily live of his own, seeking taxes only for extraordinary ventures, and that the king could do this if he would only improve the management of crown lands and cut expenses by reducing the size of the royal household, limiting pensions, and eliminating prerogative courts. Amid the debate over tonnage and poundage, Coke seems to have intended an attractive compromise. He clearly meant to establish that tonnage and poundage was revenue which the king enjoyed only by parliamentary grant. However, he also proposed that parliament establish a new scale of customs tariffs, which would likely have adjusted duties to account for inflation, thus offering Charles a larger, more predictable income. On matters of religion Coke also joined vigorously in the Commons' attack on Richard Montague, whose Arminian beliefs were portrayed as crypto-Catholic. Beneath discussions of religious doctrine lay power politics. The crown had begun to pack the bench with its supporters among the Laudian clergy, and the wealth of the Church of England had become a reservoir upon which the king might draw without parliamentary approval.<br>
<br>As well as exploring fiscal concerns, debating crown finances, and defending the Church of England, parliament took the opportunity to review foreign policy. It found little to praise. Coke was among the veteran legislators who found putting royal finances in order more important than funding a fleet. As the parliament ended he obliquely criticized Buckingham with obscure historical references, approving the medieval practice of not creating dukes (Buckingham had reached this title with unseemly speed) and questioning whether one lord admiral (Buckingham's title) could meet the duties traditionally allotted to two. Charles fathomed Coke's historical allusions and prevented him from sitting in the parliament of 1626. Coke was among six former parliamentarians pricked by the crown that year to serve as sheriffs, a duty requiring that they remain in their home counties (in Coke's case, Buckinghamshire) rather than join the Commons at Westminster. Coke fought this. With a typical blend of antiquarian learning, protestant sympathy, and canny legalism, he insisted that he could not in good faith take the sheriff's oath because it required him to persecute Lollards. The government riposted, graciously and effectively; it struck the clause on Lollards, and required Coke to take the oath and serve.<h2>
<a name="Theparliamentof1628andthepetitionofright"></a>The parliament of 1628 and the petition of right</h2>In 1628 Coke returned for what proved to be his most memorable parliament. Buckingham's wars with France and Spain led to new crises at home: soldiers quartered in citizens' homes, martial law (imposed on soldiers, threatened for civilians), and the king's penchant for demanding funds under colour of prerogative claims and then gaoling gentlemen who objected to paying the taxes that he demanded. Coke was perhaps the king's most prominent critic, speaking out against taxation without parliamentary consent, the creeping spread of martial law, and the royal power to imprison without cause shown, a prerogative claim which he sought to ban absolutely. Coke was now seventy-six. Some of his oratory was needlessly baroque, and gaps appeared in his vaunted memory. The king's lawyers nettled him with proof that he himself had long supported a royal power to gaol men without showing cause. Yet ultimately Coke proved invaluable. According to Conrad Russell, &#145;Other Parliaments had been concerned with particular liberties&#146;, purveyance and customs duties, and monopolies, but it was this parliament &#145;which first saw these liberties as collectively threatened by a threat to the ideal which held them all together, the rule of law&#146;  (Russell, 343). The metaphors on which Coke relied&#151;his claim that no man was a tenant-at-will for his liberties, or that if a lord could not imprison a villein without cause then no king could imprison a freeman without cause&#151;essentially provided an ideology which closely linked liberty and property, an ideal at the heart of the English psyche.<br>
<br>Coke led the Commons in rejecting compromise. With John Selden he carefully picked apart the ambiguities and omissions which made Charles's proposals meaningless. In conference with the Lords he proved an effective spokesman. He refused to trust the king's personal word. &#145;I know that prerogative is part of the law&#146;, he cautioned, &#145;but sovereign power is no parliamentary word: in my opinion, it weakens Magna Carta &hellip; Magna Carta is such a fellow that he will have no sovereign&#146;  (Russell, 352).<br>
<br>When Charles warned the Commons that he would veto any bill that did more than reconfirm Magna Carta, Coke must have scented a rare opportunity; the king's demand offered the old judge the chance to make new law out of the greatest medieval statute. The result was the petition of right, something more than a list of grievances, if less than an actual bill of rights. It was Coke who suggested the petition. The king answered the petition evasively, and on 4 June did so a second time announcing his intention to prorogue parliament. Coke now played a final, pivotal role. On 6 June, in highly dramatic circumstances, he spoke up, telling his colleagues that there were no abuses that the Commons could not debate or act on, and that medieval parliaments had not hesitated to name and condemn ministers of state. In this tradition Coke then pointed to Buckingham, finally, by name, as &#145;the grievance of grievances&#146; and &#145;the cause of all our miseries&#146;. This speech, wrote one Yorkshire MP, was &#145;answered with a cheerful acclamation of the House, as when one good hound recovers the scent, the rest come in with a full cry&#146;  (Bowen, 502). Coke spoke in the afternoon; by evening work on impeachment was well advanced. With the favourite under attack, Charles backed down. On 7 June the king came to Westminster and assented to the petition, &#145;soit droit fait comme est desir&eacute;&#146;&#151;words acceptable to show royal assent, as Coke assertively told the Commons  (E. Foster, &#145;Petitions and the petition of right&#146;, <span class="italic">Journal of British Studies</span>, 13, 1973, 22).<br>
<br>This was Coke's last venture into public life. He retired to his mansion at Stoke Poges. In 1628 he published <span class="italic">The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England, or, A Commentarie upon Littleton</span>, and for the remaining six years of his life he seems to have worked to complete his <span class="italic">Institutes</span>. He was seriously ill in 1631. Friends sent him doctors, Lady Hatton set out for Stoke to claim what she could find there, and the government pondered seizing his papers. Coke recovered. He was still hale in many respects and could ride at eighty, worry over his sons' debts, and hunt ready money for orphaned granddaughters' marriage portions. He played out, too, an endgame with Charles. In April 1632 the king's men raided Stoke; newswriter John Pory reported that Coke wept as his papers were removed. In 1633 Charles sealed Coke's rooms at the Inner Temple. Finally, in the last days of August 1634, while the old man lay dying, the king's men ransacked both Coke's study at Stoke and his files at the Inner Temple. Roger Coke, the judge's grandson, wrote that they seized more than fifty manuscripts and other papers.<br>
<br>Coke died at Stoke House shortly before midnight on 3 September 1634, &#145;in his bed quietly like a lamb, without any groans or outward signs of sickness, but only spent by age&#146;, his friend Sir Julius Caesar noted  (Inderwick and Roberts, 2.lxix). His body was interred in St Mary's Church at Tittleshall, Norfolk, exactly one month later. His papers vanished for seven years, until the Long Parliament voted that they be returned to his heir, Robert Coke, and published. The vote was taken, perhaps not coincidentally, on the same day on which Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, was beheaded.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5829/', "Roger Coke (c.1628&#150;1704x7)")</script> claimed that his grandfather's will was removed by Charles's servants and never seen again. However, a will and a codicil, signed by Coke in November 1623, were proved in early 1635. Throughout his career Coke had put in trust the lands he acquired, and his will added the briefest coda to these dispositions, directing simply that his executors dispose of his estate as directed by the trustees. This masterfully opaque directive left Coke's property in hands he trusted, revealed nothing to outsiders, and skirted the church courts' probate jurisdiction. The codicil added only one detail, his request that his library be preserved. Coke's executors, Sir Thomas Coventry and Sir Randolph Crewe, carried out the testator's intentions. Coke had amassed great wealth&#151;all his sons had eldest sons' portions, it was said&#151;and his heirs and their trustees kept firm hands on it. Indeed, in the reign of Elizabeth II his descendants retained much of the wealth that the family had acquired during the reign of Elizabeth I.<h2>
<a name="Cokespublications"></a>Coke's publications</h2>Coke's first well-known work was a manuscript report of <i>Shelley's case</i>, circulated soon after the decision in 1581. In 1600, afraid that unauthorized versions of his case reports might be printed&#151;and probably following the example of Edmund Plowden, with whom he had worked and whom he revered&#151;Coke issued the <span class="italic">First Part</span> of his <span class="italic">Reports</span>. He put out eleven volumes by 1615. Making available more than 467 cases, carrying the <i>imprimatur</i> and the authority of the lord chief justice, these case reports provided a critical mass of material for the rapidly developing modern common law. Reversing medieval jurisprudence, which had often relied on general learning and reason, Coke preferred to amass precedents. &#145;The reporting of particular cases or examples&#146;, he asserted, was &#145;the most perspicuous course of teaching the right rule and reason of the law&#146;  (E. Coke, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, 1600&#150;1659, 4, preface).<br>
<br>Coke began by printing great cases. With the <span class="italic">Fourth Part</span> and <span class="italic">Fifth Part</span> (1604&#150;5) he shifted to shorter cases, grouped by topics. The <span class="italic">Fifth Part</span> featured <i>Cawdrey's case</i>, with Coke's treatise on the crown's ecclesiastical supremacy. Beginning with the <span class="italic">Sixth Part</span> (1607), Coke emphasized recent decisions. For his massive <span class="italic">Book of Entries</span> (1614) he collected pleadings for his fellow lawyers' better guidance.<br>
<br>In reporting cases Coke could be robustly egocentric, trimming or omitting other lawyers' arguments. His accuracy could vary. Yet the value of these collections, as a working reference for the bar, has never been gainsaid. Bacon himself wrote:<blockquote>Had it not been for Sir Edward Coke's reports (which, though they may have errors, and some peremptory and extrajudicial resolutions more than are warranted, yet they contain infinite good decisions and rulings over of cases), the law, by this time, had been almost like a ship without ballast. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.65)</blockquote>In prefaces to each <span class="italic">Part</span>, very often free-standing essays, Coke found opportunity to expound his understanding of the law. It was in these pages, <i>inter alia</i>, that he praised the common law, honoured parliament, and attacked the Huguenot jurist Fran&ccedil;ois Hotman for his irreverence toward Littleton. In the prefaces to the <span class="italic">Fifth</span> and <span class="italic">Sixth</span> parts, Coke quarrelled with the exiled Jesuit Robert Persons, unwisely drawing return fire from a deadlier wit.<br>
<br>In 1628 Coke published his masterwork, the <span class="italic">Commentarie upon Littleton</span>, known ever thereafter as <span class="italic">Coke on Littleton</span>. The book ostensibly presents Coke's glosses on the text of Littleton's <span class="italic">Tenures</span>, an outline of the law of real property. In fact, however, his glosses overwhelm Littleton's language, ranging broadly across the law of his day. To Littleton's short first paragraph, defining tenancy in fee simple, Coke devoted eighteen folio pages of annotations. He is described as writing:<blockquote>like a helpful old wizard &hellip; anxious to pass on all his secrets, but not quite sure where to begin or end &hellip; [T]he commentary wanders through such disparate topics as etymology, alien status, misnomer in grants, interest rates and usury &hellip; the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, the eight parts of a deed, the styles and titles of the kings of England, the ownership of the Isle of Man, and the legal status of monsters and hermaphrodites. (Baker, <span class="italic">Introduction</span>, 218)</blockquote>The book long absorbed and exasperated lawyers. In the opinion of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, &#145;A more disorderly mind than Coke's and one less gifted with the power of analysing common words it would be impossible to find&#146; (<span class="italic">History of the English Criminal Law</span>, 1883, 2.206). The height of idiosyncrasy may be the section in which Coke collects the 119 places where Littleton uses the abbreviation &#145;&amp;c.&#146;<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Coke on Littleton</span> was the first volume of Coke's four <span class="italic">Institutes of the Laws of England</span>. He probably chose the title to assert that his work, in epitomizing the law of England, ranked equally with Justinian's codification of Roman law. The <span class="italic">Second Institute</span> covers thirty-nine statutes of significance, glossing them on a clause-by-clause basis. It begins with Magna Carta, continues through Plantagenet and Tudor legislation, and ultimately ends with the Jacobean statutes on houses of correction. Coke heaped honorifics on Magna Carta, which he asserted merely declared the rights all English people enjoyed under common law. The <span class="italic">Third Institute</span> covers the criminal law. Coke's background as attorney-general shaped it: more pages are devoted to treason, misprision of treason, and heresy than to homicide, rape, robbery, burglary, larceny, and theft, because the first three crimes were more serious. The <span class="italic">Fourth Institute</span>, concerning the jurisdiction of courts, was a treatise on structural constitutional law and organs of government. Coke reviewed the powers of the various government bodies existing in England&#151;legislative, administrative, fiscal, mercantile, ecclesiastical, collegiate, metropolitan, and baronial.<br>
<br>After Coke died some of his other works found their way into print, including his <span class="italic">Treatise on Bail and Mainprise</span> (1634) and <span class="italic">The Complete Copyholder</span> (1650). Publishers, working from manuscript collections of his opinions and memoranda, brought out books denominated the <span class="italic">Twelfth</span> and <span class="italic">Thirteenth</span> parts of the <span class="italic">Reports</span> in 1658 and 1659 respectively. Their uncertain provenance and varying quality long cast doubts on these reports' authority, but their connection with Coke now appears established. <span class="italic">The Complete Copyholder</span> explored a narrow topic in a rigorously structured manner, in sharp contrast to the sprawl of <span class="italic">Coke on Littleton</span>.<h2>
<a name="Cokesreputation"></a>Coke's reputation</h2>Thomas Fuller wrote that Coke would be admired &#145;whilst Fame hath a trumpet left her, and any breath to blow therein&#146;  (Fuller, 416). Wherever the common law has been applied, Coke's influence has been monumental. Between the medieval era and the modern, Maitland wrote, &#145;Coke's books are the great dividing line, and we are hardly out of the Middle Ages till he has dogmatized its results&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 5.489). Coke is the earliest judge whose decisions are still routinely cited by practising lawyers, and to whose writings one turns for a statement of what the common law held on any given topic.<br>
<br>As Sir William Holdsworth noted, Coke's works have been to the common law what Shakespeare has been to literature and the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> to religion. No master of the common law bears more responsibility than Coke for creating the legal regime which Sir William Blackstone rationalized, and Jeremy Bentham attacked, the idea of law as a <i>forest sauvage</i> of archaicism and legal fictions. At the same time&#151;and with no less fairness&#151;Coke has always been honoured as a champion of progress and justice. His commentary on the phrase <i>nisi legem terrae</i>, in a discussion of Magna Carta, is one of the earliest judicial commentaries to give a truly constitutional resonance to the phrase &#145;due process of law&#146;. John Lilburne and other Levellers cited his writings, and Thomas Jefferson considered that &#145;a sounder Whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning&#146;  (Bowen, 514). From Coke's stenographer and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Roger Williams derives a tradition of religious toleration and political independence which contrasts sharply with the intellectual legacy of Bacon's stenographer and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Thomas Hobbes.<br>
<br>The nineteenth century honoured Coke as an exponent of personal liberty and representative government. The twentieth century honoured him as the prototype of the activist judge&#151;able to draw broadly on social and economic knowledge, and not afraid to strike down laws. For the learning he amassed, for the reports he published, for pioneering judicial review, and for asserting judicial independence, Coke deserves to retain this respect.<br>
