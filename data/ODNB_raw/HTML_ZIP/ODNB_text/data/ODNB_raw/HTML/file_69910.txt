<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Agnes Syme</span>  (1882&#150;1966), <span class="occ">suffragette and campaigner for women's citizenship</span>, was born on 8 September 1882 at 23 Dublin Street, Edinburgh, the fifth child and only daughter of the six children of Alexander Macdonald and his wife, Euphemia Henderson. Alexander Macdonald, from Kiltarlity, Inverness, was a wine and spirit merchant in Edinburgh; Euphemia, who was born in Kinross, took over the business in 1893.<br>
<br>Agnes &#145;was one of the many daughters of the house who stayed at home&#146; and she later said that was why she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). &#145;Possibly it's because I was a so-called &#147;lady of leisure&#148; &hellip; At that time there were too many women running around with no training to do anything&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Dispatch</span>, 12 Dec 1962). In the autumn of 1911 the truce in suffragette militancy ended when the government announced that no further time would be given to the <span class="roman">Conciliation Bill</span>, which would have introduced a measure of women's suffrage. The most dramatic protests so far took place in early March 1912, with window-smashing raids on the West End and Whitehall. A number of Scottish women travelled to London to take part. Using &#145;a hammer, which we wore round the neck on a rope and a bit of string&#146;  (ibid.), Agnes broke a police office window. She was charged with malicious damage on 5 March 1912 and, in common with others who had attacked government property, was given two months' hard labour. That period in Holloway was formative. &#145;We learned a lot about social conditions, particularly from the women who cleaned out our cells. It was a tremendous experience, and later it helped me after I trained to become a secretary, and took up social work&#146;  (ibid.). That social work was primarily women's movement organization and campaigning on social and equality issues.<br>
<br>Agnes was secretary of the Edinburgh branch of the WSPU for a short time in 1913, but became alienated by what she saw as extreme militant activity. In 1918, with other women from both militant and constitutional suffrage campaigns, she set up the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association (WCA); she was its first and longest-serving secretary. Women's citizens' associations were formed throughout Britain at this time to organize and educate women voters into a political force and to promote women's representation. The Edinburgh association was inaugurated in Edinburgh city chambers on 9 May 1918 when &#145;The Lord Provost presided, and the hall was filled to overflowing with women, who showed keen interest and great enthusiasm in the new movement&#146;  (minutes, Edinburgh WCA, 1918&#150;19). In 1919 fifteen Scottish women's citizens' associations formed the Scottish Council of Women Citizens' Associations; they remained independent of the London-based National Women Citizens' Association.<br>
<br>Agnes remembered the inter-war Edinburgh WCA as busy and effective. &#145;There was such efficiency and drive! Deputations to Government Departments and town councils! Meetings all over the country, constant efforts to get things done. And we did get things done&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 31 March 1962). Organized citizenship was seen as the next stage for the women's movement; as well as continuing to campaign for the franchise on equal terms to men, they believed women's status as citizens would lead to feminist and social reforms. Their programme was ambitious, encompassing efforts to get more women elected to central and local government (the latter successfully) and campaigning for equal pay and promotion for women teachers and council employees, against marriage bans in employment, for pre-school nursery and play facilities, and on mental illness and handicap, public health, and social housing. With other women's organizations in 1920 they launched a campaign on &#145;child outrage&#146; (child sexual abuse), and from 1925 began to lobby for a national maternity service.<br>
<br>In July 1939 Agnes retired as secretary of the Edinburgh WCA; at that time she was caring for her younger, disabled brother, Roddy, with whom she shared a house in Strathfillan Road, Edinburgh. She had joined the Society of Friends and her organizational skills found outlet in Quaker relief work for European refugees and as a member of the management committee of Barns School in the Scottish borders. Set up in 1940 for delinquent city boys, it was run on progressive principles and was highly controversial. Agnes is well remembered by Edinburgh Friends for her strong, left-leaning beliefs and sense of injustice, her efficiency, energy, and enthusiasm, and sharp wit. Quakers who were children then remember her as &#145;the pan drop lady&#146; who brought peppermints to meeting for them. She was also active on the Edinburgh Old People's Welfare Council.<br>
<br>Agnes Macdonald died, unmarried, on 21 October 1966, aged eighty-four, after a period in a nursing home, at St Raphael's Home, Blackford Avenue, Edinburgh.<br>
