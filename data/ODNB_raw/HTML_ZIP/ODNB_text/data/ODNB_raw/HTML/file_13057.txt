<span class="headword">Herbert <span class="st"> [Harbert]</span>,  William</span>  (1583?&#150;1628), <span class="occ">poet and adventurer</span>, was born in Glamorgan, the son of Nicholas Herbert (1543&#150;1601), writer, pirate, merchant, and public official, and either his first wife, Mary Morgan, or his second wife, Catherine or Jennett Herbert (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Edward). He attended Eton College as a servitor during 1598&#150;1600 and he matriculated &#145;<i>arm. fil.</i>&#146; (that is, esquire's son) at Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 October 1600, though he was in residence from March onward, and remained for most of 1601. Following a prenuptial settlement in 1601 Herbert married Blanche Morgan, the daughter of Catherine Morgan of Llanrumney, a widow, in April 1602. In 1603 he was placed in attendance upon Prince Henry as groom of the privy chamber extraordinary, apparently for a period of twelve months. In that same year, upon reaching legal age, he inherited the administration of his estates. Throughout his adulthood he was an apparent conformist in religion, as attested by extant signed oaths.<br>
<br>The first of Herbert's two major publications, both of them extended mytho-historical poems, was <span class="italic">A Prophesie of Cadwallader, Last King of the Britaines</span> (1604), which has won critical favour over the years. Written in part to celebrate James I's accession, <span class="italic">Cadwallader</span> traces his lineage to ancient times, relying heavily (though without acknowledgement) on George Owen Harry's <span class="italic">Genealogy of the High and Mighty Monarch, James</span> (1604). In 1605 either he or his uncle William Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1609) wrote the commendatory poem &#145;In Laudem Authoris&#146; as a preface to <span class="italic">The French Garden</span> by Peter Erondell (Pierre Erondelle), a friend of the young poet's father and uncle. In 1606 appeared Herbert's second major work, <span class="italic">Englands Sorrowe, or, A Farewell to Essex</span>, which had been entered in the Stationers' register on 30 April 1605 as <span class="italic">Honors epitaphes, or, The lamentation of Brittaine, for the untimely loss of many worthy late personages</span>, and the abbreviated headline, Honors Epitaphs, appears at the top of each page.<br>
<br>Verse that is plausibly attributable to Herbert includes two poems in <span class="italic">England's Helicon</span> (1600, 1614), &#145;Wodenfrides Song in Praise of Amargana&#146; and &#145;Another of the Same&#146;; the bawdy &#145;To the Uncapable Reader&#146; that prefaces Robert Anton's <span class="italic">Moriomachia</span> (1613); and two commendatory poems written for William Browne's <span class="italic">Brittania Pastorals</span> (1625). Herbert is clearly a Spenserian, yet he also demonstrates (and acknowledges) indebtedness to Drayton, Daniel, and Chapman. In 1613 his friend William Gamage published a laudatory epigram on Herbert and <span class="italic">Cadwallader</span> in <span class="italic">Linsi-Woolsie</span>; this also contains an epigram on Herbert's father that provides the otherwise vanished information that Nicholas Herbert was the author of <span class="italic">Lle y Kymero</span>, now presumably lost. During his period as a poet Herbert lived with his wife at Llanrumney; they moved from there to his seat at St Fagans where they lived until 1616. (Herbert's other principal seat was Cogan Pill; both these properties came down to him from his father.) In 1607 he was under sheriff for Monmouthshire. A son, William, was born in 1609 (<i>d</i>. 1638).<br>
<br>In 1616 Herbert sold St Fagans to raise investment cash for Ralegh's doomed expedition to Guiana in search of goldmines. (He knew Ralegh through the Gamages of Coety, including the epigrammatist William.) Herbert financed a quarter of this venture, in the amount of &pound;1200, much of the rest being an investment by Lady Ralegh herself, and Herbert apparently contributed several hundred pounds more upon Ralegh's subsequent request. In 1617, after also investing in a voyage to America by the <span class="italic">Flying Harte</span>, he left with Ralegh for Guiana, where, among other misadventures, he nearly lost his life in a gunfight during the final, failed assault on the supposed mine site. Ralegh wrote of &#145;my cosen Herbert&#146; that he was &#145;a very valiant and honest gentleman&#146; and &#145;of singular courage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Ralegh</span>, ed. A. Latham and J. Youings, 1999, 349, 352). Herbert and Ralegh sailed back separately in 1618, with Herbert commanding a shipload of dissident Guiana veterans, whom Ralegh termed &#145;scumme&#146;  (ibid., 352), at his despairing commander's behest.<br>
<br>Upon his return Ralegh was placed under a sort of house arrest in the custody of Sir Lewis Stucley. Knowing he was headed for the block, he made a feebly conceived attempt to escape on 19 August. Herbert betrayed Ralegh in this attempt, and in fact he and two others had apparently conspired with Stucley to lead Ralegh into the escape, in order to give James yet another pretext for executing the popular old hero. On 17 September Herbert betrayed Ralegh yet again by turning king's evidence in his testimony, contradicting and discrediting Ralegh on key points  (BL, Harleian MS 6846, fol. 16). On 4 October Ralegh insisted as a matter of honour that Lady Ralegh pay Herbert what was properly owed him on his investment in the Guiana voyage from her own returns  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Ralegh</span> ed. A. Latham and J. Youings, 1999, 371&#150;2), but following the execution she baulked at doing so&#151;most likely because she knew of Herbert's betrayals. She got most of her own money back from the government (which had confiscated the ship <i>Destiny</i>), but Herbert was given a minimal &pound;700 award that was detained in the exchequer owing to a claim against it, and it is unclear whether he was ever repaid. In 1619&#150;20 he invested in an elaborate scheme to export Welsh butter by sea, and in 1620 he purchased a house in Gosfield, Essex, where his family later moved from Cogan Pill to join him. A 1624 document reports him as involved in &#145;outlawry&#146;  (NL Wales, Bute L2/57) and he was in Newgate prison in 1625. Three years later he was lodged in king's bench, Southwark, apparently for debt, and he died either there or in Cardiff on 20 November 1628.<br>
<br>Care must be taken in order to distinguish this William Herbert from his several contemporaries who bore the same name, most of them his kinsmen, some of them also writers, and with all of whom he has been understandably confused in one way or another by researchers. Among these are his uncle Sir William Herbert of Swansea (<i>d</i>. 1609); his first cousin William Herbert of White Friars (<i>d</i>. 1645); William Herbert, first Baron Powis, sometimes styled &#145;of the Red Castle&#146;, his second cousin once removed; William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke (1580&#150;1630), another second cousin once removed; Sir William Herbert of St Julian's (<i>d</i>. 1593), his third cousin once removed; William Herbert of Coldbrook, his distant cousin but near-contemporary; his own son William Herbert (1609&#150;1638); the William Herbert (<i>fl</i>. 1634&#150;1662) who wrote various religious and &#145;self-help&#146; manuals; and the W. Har. who published the funeral poem <span class="italic">Epicedium</span> (1594).<br>
