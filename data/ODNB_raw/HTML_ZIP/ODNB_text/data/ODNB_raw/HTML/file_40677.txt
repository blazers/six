<span class="headword">Skyrme,  Tony Hilton Royle</span>  (1922&#150;1987), <span class="occ">theoretical physicist</span>, was born on 5 December 1922 at 7 Blessington Road, Lewisham, London, the only child of John Hilton Royle Skyrme, bank clerk, and his wife, Muriel May Roberts. After attending a boarding-school in Lewisham he won a scholarship to Eton College, where he distinguished himself by outstanding work in mathematics, gaining a number of prizes. In 1940 he became a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, reading mathematics, and there he maintained the high standard shown at Eton. He passed part one of the mathematical tripos as a wrangler in 1942, and part three in 1943.<br>
<br>On graduating he was directed by the wartime central register of scientists to Birmingham, where a group under Rudolf Peierls was working on the theoretical aspects of atomic energy, particularly atomic weapons. Here his great ability soon attracted attention. While capable of using abstract reasoning on difficult problems, he was prepared to look at experimental situations and at measurements which needed theoretical analysis. He wrote a number of useful reports, one of which, concerned with neutron scattering, remained in demand for many years. At the end of 1943 several scientists working on atomic energy, including Peierls, were transferred to the United States to assist in the &#145;Manhattan project&#146;. Skyrme followed a little later, and worked first in New York, on problems concerning the diffusion plant for isotope separation, and then at Los Alamos.<br>
<br>After the end of the Second World War Skyrme spent two years (1946&#150;7) as a research fellow at Birmingham University, where he acquired a command of modern theoretical physics. One of the results he obtained provided a rigorous mathematical proof of an important theorem in nuclear physics. He submitted this for publication, but the referee wanted one section expanded; Skyrme never complied with this request, and the paper remained unpublished. The academic years 1948&#150;9 and 1949&#150;50 were spent at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, respectively. In 1949 he married Dorothy Mildred, daughter of Francis Charles Millest, commercial traveller; they had no children.<br>
<br>From 1950 to 1962 Skyrme worked at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, and these were his most productive years. Apart from papers relating to the design or interpretation of experiments in nuclear physics, and much work on specific problems of nuclear structure, he made two pioneering contributions to nuclear physics. One was to show how to handle short-range forces in a three-body problem; the other, not unrelated, was a powerful approximation to nuclear forces, later widely used as the &#145;Skyrme model&#146;. An even more original contribution was a treatment of fundamental particles, in which particles such as neutrons and protons, which obey the Pauli exclusion principle, appear as manifestations of fields such as that of mesons. These ideas were so revolutionary that it was some years before they received adequate attention. Later the study of these &#145;Skyrmions&#146; became a flourishing branch of theoretical physics. For this work Skyrme was awarded the Hughes medal of the Royal Society in 1985.<br>
<br>During a year's leave from Harwell he and his wife spent a semester in the University of Pennsylvania and then returned via the United States, Australia, and the Far and Middle East, making all the land journeys by Land Rover. They had enjoyed Malaysia, and when changes at Harwell made his condition there less congenial, he accepted a post in the University of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, where they arrived, again by Land Rover, in the autumn of 1962. Since the staff of the department was much smaller than he had been led to believe, there were heavy teaching duties and few people interested in research. In 1964 Skyrme accepted an invitation to a professorship in Birmingham, initially as head of the department, but later he was relieved of the administrative duties. He remained in Birmingham until his death.<br>
<br>Skyrme was distinguished by a deep understanding of physics, by a great command of mathematics, and, above all, by an original and fertile imagination. He was of medium height, with light brown hair and brown eyes. As a young man he had a slim, athletic figure; in later life he put on much weight. He tended to be rather quiet, being a solitary person who did not like joint work, but preferred to think about problems on his own. Skyrme died on 25 June 1987 in Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, of an embolism after an operation, his wife surviving him.<br>
