<span class="headword">Polwhele,  Theophilus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was of Cornish birth but was living in Somerset when, on 29 March 1644, he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a sizar. He was placed under the tutorship of William Sancroft, later archbishop of Canterbury, and graduated BA in 1648. On 5 September 1649 the county committee of Dorset ordered his appointment as rector of Langton Long Blandford, Dorset. Soon afterwards, Polwhele married a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2099/', "William Benn (1600&#150;1681)")</script>, minister of All Saints in nearby Dorchester. On 27 May 1650 the town corporation voted &pound;10 &#145;out of the parsonage monny&#146; to be paid to Polwhele &#145;as a testimony of our respects to Mr Ben (whose eldest daughter he hath lately marryed)&#146;. The marriage produced a son, Isaac, and three daughters, Elizabeth (possibly the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45820/', "E. Polewheele")</script>), Susanna, and Johannah.<br>
<br>On 18 June 1651 &#145;whereas Mr Theophilus Polwhele late minister &hellip; hath lately left the place, so that the people there have no preaching minister&#146;, a successor was appointed at Long Blandford  (Mayo, <span class="italic">Minute Books</span>, 572). It seems that Polwhele returned to Cambridge for admission in 1651 to the degree of MA, but soon moved to Carlisle as a preacher, for he later referred to the kindness to him of its governors and citizens, while he was &#145;a student in the university, and afterwards a preacher in their city&#146;  (T. Polwheile, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Self-Deniall</span>, 1658, title-page). On 29 March 1653 the commissioners for the propagation of the gospel wrote from Newcastle confirming that he had been examined and approved by a panel of godly ministers to preach at Carlisle, and allocating for his use rents to the value of over &pound;100. In 1654 he was a member of the committee for ejecting scandalous ministers in the counties of Cumberland, Durham, Northumberland, and Westmorland. His impressive stipend, however, was not actually paid in full; on 18 May 1655 it was ordered that the shortfall be paid him by the collector.<br>
<br>However, Polwhele had already left the north-east. On 8 January 1655 he was admitted to the Clare and Tidcombe portions of the vicarage of Tiverton, in succession to John Rowe, newly appointed preacher at Westminster Abbey. Having come to a financial agreement with the sequestered rector, Richard Newte, Polwhele compounded for the first fruits of this well-endowed benefice in 1658. On 24 October 1657 he was appointed an assistant to the commissioners into the ministry of Devon. The following year he published <span class="italic">A Treatise of Self-Deniall</span>, which included a notable attack on the hypocrisy of those who pretended to live virtuous lives while drinking, gambling, and committing adultery behind closed doors: &#145;there is no difference betwixt the grossest anti-scripturists, as familists, ranters, etc, and many of those that seem to be their greatest adversaries and opposers but in words only&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>). Polwhele sympathized with the Independent or congregational outlook, and the work contains a second preface by the minister Ralph Venning which describes the author as his friend. In May 1660 Polwhele was one of the signatories of the address to Charles II from congregational ministers in Devon.<br>
<br>To John Walker's charge that Polwhele had allowed the parsonage at Clare to fall into ruin, Edmund Calamy responded with the claim that the damage dated back to the civil wars. He adds that Polwhele rebuilt and lived in the parsonage house of Tidcombe, remaining there until his ejection in 1660. In 1665 he was still living at Tiverton, and &#145;there keepes seditious Conventicles&#146;  (quoted in <span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>). In 1667 he published <span class="italic">Of Quencing the Spirit</span>, to which Lewis Stuckey contributed a preface. In 1669 he was reported to be preaching at Cruwys Morchard and was bound over at the Devon assizes and later fined. One of Polwhele's chief enemies was &#145;Mr Foot, an eminent merchant of Tiverton&#146;, a former member of his congregation, who on becoming mayor is reported to have interrupted his preaching and &#145;committed him to the custody of a sergeant&#146;  (Dunsford, 371&#150;2).<br>
<br>Polwhele had married a second wife, Maria, but she died before 7 April 1671. On 5 August 1673 at Bideford, he married Jane Strange of Huntsham; there seem not to have been any children of these two marriages. On 2 April 1672, under the indulgence, he was granted a licence to teach as a congregationalist at Tiverton. He was living there when he signed on 10 October 1674 the preface to his <span class="italic">Of Ejaculatory Prayer</span>, dedicated to a merchant, Mr Matthew Skinner. In 1687, after the declaration of indulgence by James II, the Steps Meeting-House was built at Tiverton. Polwhele was appointed its first minister; Samuel Bartlett was made his assistant, and succeeded him as pastor. Polwhele died in 1689 and was buried in the churchyard of St Peter, Tiverton, on 3 April. His daughter Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1691) had married fellow Independent minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16878/', "Stephen Lobb (d. 1699)")</script>; their son was the physician and nonconformist minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16879/', "Theophilus Lobb (1678&#150;1763)")</script>.<br>
