<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  William Robert</span>, second duke of Leinster  (1749&#150;1804), <span class="occ">landowner and political reformer</span>, was born on 12 March 1749 at Arlington Place, Piccadilly, London, the second of nineteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9565/', "James Fitzgerald, first duke of Leinster (1722&#150;1773)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Lady Emily Mary Lennox (1731&#150;1814) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48893/', "Fitzgerald, Emilia Mary")</script>], daughter of Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond, and his wife, Lady Sarah Cadogan. On the death of his elder brother George in 1765 he became earl of Offaly and the following year, when his father was created duke of Leinster, he assumed the title marquess of Kildare. He was educated at Eton College between 1758 and 1765, and then received a commission as cornet in the army. In the same year his parents sent him to a military academy in France, which led to a grand tour in Europe, ostensibly to study military tactics and fortifications. In his absence he was elected MP for Dublin City in 1767, though he was too young to sit in parliament. He was re-elected the following year and returned to Ireland in October 1769 to take his seat.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1773 Kildare became second duke of Leinster and assumed the role of Ireland's premier peer. Financial pressures on the family were temporarily eased two years later when on 7 November 1775 he married Emilia Olivia St George (1759&#150;1798), daughter and heir of St George Saint-George, Baron St George, and Elizabeth Dominick. He and Emilia had ten children, of whom their second son, Augustus Frederick, born in 1791, became the third duke of Leinster. The duke's social position, coupled with his patriotic reputation, led to his being closely involved in the volunteer movement in Ireland, most notably during the &#145;free trade or else&#146; demonstration in Dublin on 4 November 1779. Despite his appointment as commander-in-chief of the volunteers in 1779 his essentially moderate stance on legislative independence resulted in his replacement in 1780 by Lord Charlemont.<br>
<br>During the 1780s, because of his pressing financial situation, Leinster vacillated between the parliamentary opposition, with whom he shared a natural whig outlook, and the Irish administration. The lord lieutenant, Rutland, described him as &#145;fickle and unsteady in his opinions&#146;. He was the first knight created under the newly instituted Order of St Patrick in 1783 and took a place in the privy council in the same year. By 1788 he had entered government with the lucrative sinecure of master of the rolls. However, the duke's stance in favour of the prince of Wales during the Regency crisis resulted in his loss of office and his alignment with the Irish Whig Club. During the early 1790s he declared in favour of parliamentary reform and full Catholic relief and organized the short-lived Association of the Friends of the Constitution, Liberty, and Peace in an attempt to combat the ineffective Irish Whig Club and radical United Irishmen. His opposition to the war with France slowed his appointment to the command of the Kildare militia, which he received a year late in 1794.<br>
<br>The duke, with other reformers, was gradually stranded by the growing polarization of Irish politics in the late 1790s, and his support for a radical petition and meeting of Kildare inhabitants in 1797 resulted in a serious rift with the lord lieutenant, Lord Camden, and the loss of his political and military positions. As a result of the decision by Irish (and English) whigs to withdraw from parliamentary activity he effectively abandoned his political position in Ireland shortly afterwards and travelled to Bristol with his wife, who was dangerously ill and died the following year on 23 June 1798. In Ireland the rising of 1798 destroyed large areas of his Kildare estates. The capture and death of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9546/', "Lord Edward Fitzgerald")</script>, a leading United Irishman, together with unfounded suspicions in Ireland and England that Leinster secretly supported the rebels, seriously damaged his reputation. The <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1800 destroyed the major plank of his political power though he received much-needed compensation for his disenfranchised boroughs of Kildare and Athy. In July 1803 he had just returned from London when United Irishmen from Maynooth, close to his seat at Carton, rose in support of a second, smaller, rebellion, in which he was again implicated. He died of strangury on 20 October 1804 at his residence, Carton House, and was buried at St Bridget's Cathedral, Kildare, five days later.<br>
