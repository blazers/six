<span class="headword">Lindsay,  David</span>, eleventh earl of Crawford  (<em>d.</em> 1607), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_16692"></a><span class="headword">David Lindsay</span>, tenth earl of Crawford  (1526/7&#150;1574)<span class="occ"></span>, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1574), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1823/', "David Beaton (1494?&#150;1546)")</script>, cardinal and archbishop of St Andrews, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66295/', "Marion Ogilvy (d. 1575)")</script>; his parents married at Finavon in April 1546, his mother bringing a substantial dowry. His paternal grandfather, Alexander Lindsay (<i>d</i>. 1542), usually known as &#145;the wicked master&#146;, had forfeited the Crawford title following his murder of a servant of Lord Glamis; this began a feud with the Lyon family that was to erupt at intervals for the remainder of the century. However, his first marriage being childless, David Lindsay of Edzell (<i>d</i>. 1558), who had become ninth earl of Crawford, adopted as his heir David son of Alexander, who in due course became tenth earl. This earl acted as cupbearer to Queen Mary at her marriage to Lord Darnley in July 1565 and took his seat as a privy councillor the following October. He supported the queen at the battle of Langside in 1568, but submitted to the new regime in 1570. He died at Finavon or Cairnie, Fife, shortly before 1 November 1574, when his son David was recorded as eleventh earl; the tenth earl was buried at Dundee.<br>
<br>The eleventh earl had married at Perth on 12 February 1573 Lilias, daughter of David Drummond, second Lord Drummond, and his wife, Lilias Ruthven. Lilias brought a portion of 10,000 marks, but the couple soon separated. Crawford continued the conservative political and religious traditions of the family, being regarded as a &#145;convert&#146; of the Jesuit William Crichton, and he was a supporter of the imprisoned Queen Mary. He is recorded as a member of the privy council in 1575, but in March 1578 an encounter in School House Wynd in Stirling between John Lyon, eighth Lord Glamis, the chancellor, and Crawford, together with their respective retinues, culminated in the shooting of the chancellor. Glamis had been a prominent member of King James's party and a supporter of the recently deposed regent, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton. Crawford, who had a reputation as a marksman, was held responsible for the murder and was temporarily imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle before being allowed to return to his house at Cairnie. Further trouble followed with the master of Glamis and the Lyon family. In September 1579 Crawford was summoned to answer on 3 November for various crimes in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh. Lord Lindsay of the Byres and David Lindsay of Edzell stood caution for him. On 7 November Crawford signed a bond valid until 1 May 1579 undertaking not to molest the master of Glamis any further. In December he was given licence to go abroad for three years, with a group of Lindsays and Gordons standing surety for him.<br>
<br>The arrival in September 1579, at the invitation of James VI, of Esm&eacute; Stewart, later duke of Lennox, prompted a resurgence of the minority pro-Marian interest within the country and the final eclipse of the earl of Morton, along with the increase in power and influence of a Stewart faction. A distinct, but secret, foreign policy developed, Francophile in character, sympathetic to the exiled Queen Mary, and with vague and half-hearted aspirations for the restoration of Roman Catholicism. Contacts were fostered between James VI, Lennox, Catholic exiles in France, English and Scottish Jesuits, and seminary priests. Crawford was part of this network. He was at the French court in February 1580, and was reported to have left in May for Orl&eacute;ans with a view to travelling to Italy. By October he had apparently departed Orl&eacute;ans for Rome, with David Graham of Fintry, an important Marian and member of the Catholic party. On 22 July 1581 Crawford returned from France with George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, a prominent conservative who had been in exile at Orl&eacute;ans, and from this time was to be associated with him and with the policies of Lennox, especially in his confrontation with the presbyterian party in the reformed kirk. Having divorced his first wife, in December Crawford married Lady Grizel Stewart, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26491/', "John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl (d. 1579)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret Fleming.<br>
<br>In August 1582 an Anglophile party of disaffected nobles and lairds united around a platform of militant protestantism, and seized the king in a coup&#151;the Ruthven raid&#151;which forced the exile of Lennox. During the king's captivity Crawford several times asked for leave to go to France, but was not granted a safe conduct by the English. In June 1583, when James escaped from the government of the Ruthven raiders, Crawford and the conservative, Francophile, and Marian party rallied to his support. A new favourite emerged, James Stewart, fifth earl of Arran, who consolidated his authority by intruding royal agents into positions of power. In September 1583 Crawford was made provost of Dundee, against the will of the burgesses. James demonstrated his favour by spending two days with the earl at Cairnie, continuing to urge reconciliation between Crawford and the master of Glamis. James displayed his confidence in Crawford and cultivated the Catholic party, which was useful to him for its cosmopolitan contacts and as an alternative to an increasingly aggressive kirk. Crawford was a consistent opponent of the Melvillian party in the kirk; he was a lord of the articles at the parliament of May 1584, which drew up the &#145;black acts&#146; and which reasserted the authority of bishops and denounced the new presbyteries. In 1587 he protested against an act of parliament appropriating ecclesiastical revenues to the crown, displaying his innate religious conservatism but also arguing for the right of noble patronage and the continuance of the manipulation of ecclesiastical revenues which had been customary for centuries.<br>
<br>During the ascendancy of Arran the English government worked with Scottish dissidents to undermine his position. Arran's fall in November 1587, engineered by a coalition of nobles including some Ruthven raiders, caused a reversal of Crawford's fortunes. Crawford continued to manoeuvre to regain access to the king and to promote pro-Marian and anti-English policies. He was imprisoned from November 1585 to March 1586 by the new government because of his French and Catholic sympathies. On his release he joined his former confederate the earl of Huntly. The emergence of John Maitland of Thirlestane as chancellor in 1587 signalled for Crawford another unwelcome development in Scottish politics. As well as sealing an alliance with England, Maitland promoted greater participation by the lairds in parliament as shire commissioners, and co-operated with the radical presbyterians in the general assembly of the kirk, using them as a counterweight to the influence of the Catholic earls. Crawford rightly saw this as a challenge to the traditional privileges of the nobility and opposed it.<br>
<br>Scottish political society became increasingly polarized in the late 1580s, reflecting the unresolved tensions of the Lennox years. Each faction attempted to increase its power at home through winning foreign support. Throughout 1588 the earls conspired to destabilize the king's government by ejecting Maitland from the chancellorship and Crawford's old enemy, the master of Glamis, from the treasurership. The king retained his chancellor while urging reconciliation between Crawford and Glamis and showing personal favour and patronage to Huntly. A precarious balance between the factions was thus maintained. Although Crawford was suspected of disaffection and of links with Spain he was still given charge of the defence of Forfarshire and the neighbouring coast against the threat of the Spanish Armada.<br>
<br>Despite its defeat, the Armada showed that Spain retained considerable power. Huntly, Crawford, and their confederates, advised by the duke of Guise, had been trying to tap into this source of power since 1586. The nature of their correspondence with Spain was revealed to James VI by the English ambassador in February 1589. It is likely that James had been aware of these contacts for some time and may even have encouraged them. Huntly, the emerging leader of the Roman Catholic anti-Maitland and pro-Spanish party, was imprisoned for a week on easy terms in Edinburgh Castle. On his release he made for the north-east, where he began an insurrection designed to win the king to his cause and eradicate Maitland; he was joined by Francis Hay, ninth earl of Erroll, and Crawford, and later by Francis Stewart, fifth earl of Bothwell.<br>
<br>On 10 April Crawford, with Huntly and Erroll, captured the master of Glamis in Perth, thereby striking at a reported plot against them by Maitland, John Stewart, twenty-fourth earl of Atholl, and Morton. The Catholic earls declared that their grievance was solely against Maitland, while religious concerns were added to their manifesto to encourage further support from Spain, whose considerable subsidies enabled them to maintain their forces in the field. The earls took possession of Aberdeen, from where they issued proclamations in the king's name stating that he was held captive and forced against his will to treat the nobles with more rigour than he desired. The king adhered to Maitland and the English alliance and marched north to confront the earls at the Brig O'Dee outside Aberdeen in April 1589. Despite their superior force, 3000 men to the king's 1000, the earls did not give battle but surrendered. Crawford confessed his crime and was imprisoned briefly in Edinburgh before being warded in St Andrews, nearer his own power base. He was released in September 1589.<br>
<br>Crawford's public involvement with the Catholic party diminished after 1589. He attended the privy council in 1591, and his religious opinions were still causing concern in 1593 when the provincial synod of Fife advised Andrew Melville to confer with him and the earl of Rothes. He maintained his attachment to the Huntly faction since in October 1593 he was on the assize which acquitted Huntly, Erroll, and Angus for the murder of the earl of Moray. Crawford was present at the parliament of May 1594 but did not play a prominent role. By 1595 he was observed attending protestant sermons and religious exercises. In 1596 the king was still trying to achieve the final reconciliation of Crawford and the master of Glamis. In March that year Crawford sought a safe conduct to go abroad; it was also reported that he was a possible ambassador to France. In April a further opportunity arose for him to serve as envoy, to Denmark. The safe conduct was granted since the English government believed that careful handling might win Crawford to their cause but already he was politically a spent force. He found himself more isolated, with his own former allies on the defensive.<br>
<br>Crawford's last years were marked by the resurgence of a feud. In October 1605 his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_16696"></a><span class="headword">David Lindsay</span>, master of Crawford  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1620)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized at Perth on 8 March 1576, murdered and mutilated David Lindsay of Balgavie, a Roman Catholic convert of William Crichton and deeply implicated in traffic with Spain and Rome. Despite his conviction and outlawry the master remained at large and appeared in Edinburgh in June 1607. On 5 June David Lindsay of Edzell, son of Walter Lindsay of Balgavie, lay in wait for the master, and in the resulting ambush the master's uncle and the earl of Crawford's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16679/', "Alexander Lindsay, Lord Spynie")</script>, were killed. Spynie was a friend of Walter and his murder split the Lindsay family more deeply. Crawford himself died either early in October that year or on 22 November, at Cupar, Fife. He was buried at Dundee. His son David, who succeeded as twelfth earl, married some time between 4 March 1606 and 16 April 1610 Lady Jane (Joan) Kerr, daughter of Mark Kerr, first earl of Lothian and widow of Robert Boyd, master of Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1597); the couple later divorced. The twelfth earl died in June 1620 at Edinburgh Castle and was buried in the Canongate. His former countess had married before 16 February 1618 Thomas Hamilton of Robertoun; she died before 1633.<br>
