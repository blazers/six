<span class="headword">Lake, Sir  Edward</span>, baronet  (1596<span class="mult">x</span>1600&#150;1674), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Lake of Irby-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, and Anne, youngest daughter and coheir of Edward Wardell of Keelby in the same county. He graduated BA from St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1626, was incorporated in the same degree at Oxford on 15 December 1627, and was admitted bachelor of civil law on 24 January 1628 as a member of St Alban Hall, Oxford. He ultimately took his doctor's degree, practised as a civilian, and in May 1639 became advocate-general for Ireland, where he served as MP for the borough of Cavan from 1639 until his expulsion on 9 November 1640.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the civil war Lake both fought, and reputedly wrote, on the king's side; <span class="italic">A Just Apology for his Sacred Majestie</span> (1642) has been attributed to him. At the battle of Edgehill he earned fame, and royal gratitude, for a signal act of heroism when, having lost the use of his left hand by a shot, he placed his horse's bridle between his teeth and fought with his sword in his right hand. He received sixteen wounds, was taken prisoner, and detained seven weeks at Great Crosby, Lancashire. He managed to escape and by Christmas 1642 was safe at Bangor, Caernarvonshire. On 20 October 1643 he arrived at Oxford, and on the 23rd, the anniversary of Edgehill, was kindly received by the king. He was promised a baronetcy, granted by a warrant for a patent which never passed the great seal, as well as the honour of an augmentation to his arms incorporating a royal lion, besides some compensation for the loss of his estate in England and Ireland. Two months afterwards the king sent him to Worcester. At the Restoration, Lake petitioned importunately for preferment claiming he had been promised mastership of the rolls in Ireland and a grant of forfeited lands worth &pound;600 a year, but had to content himself with the chancellorship of the diocese of Lincoln. He was granted the title of baronet by a patent dated 10 July 1661.<br>
<br>At Lincoln, Lake occupied the front line in the war between orthodoxy and dissent, having played his own small part in the unfolding Restoration church settlement with the publication in 1662 of his <span class="italic">Memoranda: Touching the Oath ex officio</span>. In 1666 a nonconformist barrister named Edward King of Ashby, Lincolnshire, charged him before the committee of parliament for grievances with extortion and illegal conduct. King printed his petition and circulated it throughout the county. Lake published an elaborate <span class="italic">Answer</span> which apparently satisfied the committee, but his struggles with the highly litigious, and highly effective, King ran the chancellor ragged. Although Lake fought back, he was repeatedly worsted, then left high and dry by his royal master's declaration of indulgence against which he protested in 1672. He died on 18 July 1674, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 20 July, where his monument describes him as of Bishop's Norton, Lincolnshire. His wife, Anne, eldest daughter and coheir of Simon Bibye of Buckden, Huntingdonshire, died in or before 1670. The couple had at least one child, Edward, who died an infant before 1666. Lake was succeeded in his title by his grandnephew, Bibye Lake (1684&#150;1744), who petitioned Queen Anne on the nature of Charles I's award to his great-uncle; Lake was granted the title of first baronet in 1711.<br>
