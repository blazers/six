<span class="headword">Ferrey,  Benjamin</span>  (1810&#150;1880), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 1 April 1810 at Christchurch, Hampshire, the youngest son of Benjamin Ferrey, draper and sometime mayor of Christchurch, who traced his descent from Huguenot &eacute;migr&eacute;s. While at the grammar school at Wimborne in Dorset, where he received his early education, Ferrey used to spend hours drawing in the minster. In or about 1825 he was sent to London to study architectural draughtsmanship with Augustus Charles Pugin. He remained with him for seven years as a boarder in the Pugins' house in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. During this time he accompanied Pugin and his other pupils on drawing tours in England and France, the purpose of which was, in part, to assemble illustrations for Pugin's books. Ferrey is credited with plates in several of them, including <span class="italic">Views in Paris</span> (1829&#150;31). For <span class="italic">A series of ornamental timber gables from existing examples in England and France, of the sixteenth century, drawn by B. Ferrey under the direction of A. Pugin, with descriptive letter-press by E. J. Willson</span> (1831), he made all the original drawings. Ferrey was the only one of Pugin's pupils who lived too far from London to go home at weekends. As a result he became more intimate with the family and in particular with the young Augustus Welby Pugin, of whom he was a close companion in their formative years. The friendship was to have a considerable influence on Ferrey as an architect and eventually led him to become Pugin's biographer.<br>
<br>In 1833 Ferrey went to work in the office of William Wilkins, where he gained a practical training in architecture, working on the detail drawings for the National Gallery. He was also able to expand his repertoire beyond the Gothic, for which A. C. Pugin's school maintained a strongly partisan support in the battle of the styles. Ferrey's links with the school remained close, however. In his first publication, <span class="italic">The Antiquities of the Priory of Christchurch, Hants</span> (1834), with text by E. W. Brayley, he followed the style of A. C. Pugin's own antiquarian works. Ferry entered the competition for the rebuilding of the palace of Westminster in 1835. He also entered into the pamphlet war surrounding the competition. Like A. W. N. Pugin he was moved to respond to A. W. Hakewill's attack on the Gothic and published his <span class="italic">Answer to Thoughts on Rebuilding the Houses of Parliament</span> in 1835. No copy of it is known to survive. From 1834 to 1836 Ferrey was in partnership with Thomas Larkins Walker, who had been a fellow pupil, and they kept an office in Great Russell Street. During these years Ferrey laid out the estate of Sir George Gervis at Bournemouth. Most of his villas were destroyed in the 1920s, but the hotel, now the Royal Bath, survives. It was possibly on the strength of this first important commission that in 1836 he married Ann Lucas (<i>c</i>.1812&#150;1871), of Stapleton Hall, Hornsey. She shared her husband's antiquarian interests and their domestic life was happy. They had three children, two daughters and a son. The latter, Edmund Benjamin (<i>c</i>.1846&#150;1900), became an architect.<br>
<br>Ferrey was an amiable man and popular, with a pleasing, friendly appearance. He was a capable if not an outstanding architect. His practice expanded steadily and respectably over the years. In 1839 he became one of the first fellows of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was later twice vice-president. His most distinguished work was ecclesiastical, his training with the Pugins helping him to become, according to Charles Eastlake, &#145;one of the earliest, ablest, and most zealous pioneers of the modern Gothic school&#146;  (<span class="italic">A History of the Gothic Revival</span>, 1872, 220). After experiments in various styles, including the Norman, he settled, like most of his contemporaries, for the &#145;middle pointed&#146; or Decorated. The patronage of Angela Burdett Coutts enabled him to realize, in St Stephen's, Rochester Row, and its vicarage and associated schools (1845&#150;50) &#145;one of the most complete and costly&#146;  (ibid., 381) exercises in that style to date. The closest Ferrey ever came to scandal was in 1842, when his church of St Nicholas, East Grafton, Wiltshire, was under construction. The stone vaulting collapsed, killing a visiting antiquary, the Revd George Montgomery, who was subsequently buried at Bishopstone in a handsome Gothic tomb, for which the commission was given to A. W. N. Pugin. Despite this accident, Ferrey became one of the consulting architects of the Incorporated Church Building Society. In his own ecclesiastical work, however, he did not develop. Remaining loyal to the Puginian tradition, he refused to look at the continental models that inspired the structural polychromy and the more robust manner of the &#145;high Victorian&#146; style. As a result his own began to seem old-fashioned. All Saints', Blackheath, completed in 1867, looks like a building of the 1840s. It is, nevertheless, a fine church set picturesquely in the hollow of the heath.<br>
<br>Ferrey also had an extensive country house practice, in which he was more stylistically flexible. He rebuilt Wynnstay, Denbighshire, for Sir Watkin Wynn, after a fire in 1858, in the French Renaissance revival style. He partially rebuilt Bulstrode Park in Buckinghamshire for the duke of Somerset from 1861 to 1870. Correspondence relating to this commission survives in the Devon Record Office. His last commission was Bagshot Park in Surrey (1877), for the duke of Connaught, a brick and stone Tudor mansion. Neither house has, however, been much admired. The rest of Ferrey's architectural efforts were devoted to parsonages, schools, and public buildings, of which the town hall in Dorchester (1847&#150;8) is one of the most successful. Others include Luton town hall (1846), Dorset County Hospital (1839&#150;56), and St Peter's College, Saltley, Birmingham (1847&#150;50). Like many of his contemporaries, he was an active restorer of medieval churches, notably of the lady chapel and west front of Wells Cathedral (1842&#150;50). He became honorary architect to the diocese of Bath and Wells in 1841 and held the post until his death. His restorations have sometimes seemed insensitive to later commentators, but they were always thoughtful. In 1845 he contributed &#145;Remarks on the Gothic towers of Somerset&#146; to James Cottle's <span class="italic">Some Account of the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Taunton, and the Restoration Thereof</span>. Ferrey was proud of his election, in 1863, to the Society of Antiquaries. He also helped to found the Royal Architectural Museum.<br>
<br>Arguably Ferrey's most important work, however, was his second and last book, <span class="italic">Recollections of A. N. Welby Pugin and his Father, Augustus Pugin</span>, published in 1861. This memoir, one of the first architectural biographies, brings the reader close to both its subjects. Ferrey's style is plain but engaging and his value as an eyewitness far outweighs his inability to organize material. A devout, conventional Anglican, Ferrey found it impossible to sympathize with his friend's conversion to Roman Catholicism and had, apparently, lost touch with him in later years. The book's greatest strength is its account of the young Pugin and his father, of the Great Russell Street school, and the world of architectural practice in late Georgian London. The quality of the book that ensured its survival, its author's unconcern with the depiction of its subjects as &#145;great men&#146; according to the conventions of Victorian biography, gave rise to criticism when it was published. Ferrey's childhood dislike of Catherine Pugin, A. C. Pugin's wife, led him to caricature her in a manner that was also felt, by contemporaries, to be unfair. The book's reception was, however, generally enthusiastic.<br>
<br>With the exception of a brief but happy period from 1846 to 1853, when the family home was near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, Ferrey seems to have lived entirely in London. He always kept an office there and had several articled pupils, including his son, Edmund Benjamin Ferrey. His leisure time was occupied with drawing: some of his views of Italy, Switzerland, and Germany were lithographed for the Architectural Publication Society. He was also a keen amateur musician and fly-fisherman. Ferrey was well known and well liked in his profession, and received in 1870 the RIBA royal gold medal. The following year his wife died and in 1872 he married Emily Hopkinson. With his son's help he continued to practise, despite a stroke and failing health. He died on 22 August 1880, at his home, 55 Inverness Terrace, Bayswater, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
