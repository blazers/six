<span class="headword">Bingham,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1668, <em>d.</em> 1723), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, was baptized on 28 September 1668 at All Saints', Wakefield, Yorkshire, the son of Francis Bingham (<i>b</i>. 1625, <i>d</i>. in or after 1680), of Wakefield, a nonconformist, who had originally been apprenticed as a cutler. He was educated at Wakefield grammar school and matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 26 May 1684 and graduated BA in 1688. He was elected a fellow on 1 July 1689 and proceeded MA in 1691. By June 1691 he was a tutor, one of his first pupils being another native of Wakefield, John Potter, the future archbishop of Canterbury. Bingham was ordained deacon on 20 December 1691 by the bishop of Oxford, and ordained a priest on 12 March 1693.<br>
<br>Bingham's promising university career was cut short following a topical sermon preached at St Peter-in-the-East on 28 October 1695 on the Trinity, in which he expounded the patristic notions of <i>ousia</i>, <i>persona</i>, and <i>substantia</i>. It was denounced as heretical to the vice-chancellor by John Beauchamp, a fellow of Trinity, and the hebdomadal board condemned part of it as &#145;false, impious and heretical&#146;  (Barnard, &#145;Bingham and asceticism&#146;, 300). Other charges were also levelled including accusations of Arianism, tritheism, and the heresy of Valentinus Gentilis, and Bingham was denounced by Robert South as a follower of Dr William Sherlock. To avoid deprivation Bingham resigned his fellowship on 23 November 1695 and was then presented to the rectory of Headbourne Worthy, near Winchester, by Dr John Radcliffe, another native of Wakefield, who had recently purchased the advowson. From this preferment, valued at about &pound;100 per annum, and conveniently situated near to the cathedral library, Bingham undertook his scholarly research into the antiquities of the church. Nor did his exile from Oxford curtail his appetite for controversy, for soon after his appointment to Headbourne Worthy he preached a visitation sermon on 12 May 1696 on the same subject, and returned to the subject in the following year in a visitation sermon preached on 16 September 1697. All three sermons were published as <span class="italic">Three Sermons on the Trinity</span>.<br>
<br>On 26 November 1702 Bingham married Dorothy (1672&#150;1755), daughter of Richard and Constance Pocock of Colemore, Hampshire. They had ten children, two sons and four daughters surviving their father. In 1706 Bingham published <span class="italic">The French Church's Apology for the Church of England</span>, which &#145;contains a modest vindication of the doctrine, worship, government, and discipline of our church from the chief objections of dissenters, and returns answer to them upon the principles of the reformed church of France&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). It was dedicated to Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury, who Thomas Hearne felt would &#145;grumble at his writings against dissenters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.221). In 1708 the first volume of Bingham's <span class="italic">Origines ecclesiasticae, or, Antiquities of the Christian Church</span> was published. By 1711 three volumes had been published. Bingham was then diverted into a controversy concerning lay baptism, responding to Roger Lawrence's <span class="italic">Lay Baptism Invalid</span> (1708) with his <span class="italic">Scholastical History of Lay Baptism</span> (1712). This was originally intended as a chapter in the <span class="italic">Origines</span>, but Bingham decided to publish it separately to refute the view that those who had not been baptized by an episcopally ordained minister lacked true Christian initiation. Bingham contended that the ancient church when she received members of other sects &#145;did not recognize their ordinations, but by her determination gave them the authority which they had not previously possessed&#146;  (Every, 129&#150;30).<br>
<br>In 1712 Bishop Jonathan Trelawny of Winchester collated Bingham to the rectory of Havant, near Portsmouth, which he was allowed to hold with Headbourne Worthy. In May 1713 Bingham approached the lord treasurer, Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, after hearing that Oxford, a noted patron of scholarly research, approved of his historical endeavours. After detailing his &#145;labouring hard at this work&#146; almost twenty years and his financial commitment to six children and &#145;some poor relations that depend also entirely upon my charity&#146;, he requested from Oxford some further preferment to continue &#145;the work of the antiquities of the church&#146;. His ideal was a prebend of Winchester, &#145;where my business chiefly lies among the books of the library&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.289), but realizing that this would not be possible he asked for any place that would answer his designs. However, he did not receive another living, and yet he continued to ask Oxford for patronage, including a place at Charterhouse for his son Joseph. Moreover, Bingham seems to have lost money in government lottery schemes and also in the South Sea Bubble.<br>
<br>Work continued on the <span class="italic">Origines</span>, the tenth and final volume being published in 1722, Bingham telling Hearne &#145;he hath been twenty years about it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.19). Bingham's aim as outlined in the work was:<blockquote>to give such a methodical account of the antiquities of the christian church as others have done of the Greek and Roman and Jewish antiquities, by reducing the ancient customs, usages, and practices of the church under certain proper heads, whereby the reader may take a view at once of any particular usage or custom of christians for four or five centuries. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>It covered &#145;the hierarchy, ecclesiology, territorial organization, rites, discipline, and calendar of the primitive church&#146;  (Barnard, &#145;Bingham and the early church&#146;, 197), based on primary sources.<br>
<br>Bingham was working on a second edition of the <span class="italic">Origines</span>, together with an abridgement, when he died on 17 August 1723. He was buried at St Swithen's, Headbourne Worthy. His undated will left &pound;50 and half his books to each of his two sons, Richard and Joseph, &pound;100 each to his four daughters, and &pound;50 to his sister, Welcom. To his wife he left &#145;my house and yard&#146; in Headbourne Worthy and the &#145;right and title&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/594, Fol. 8<i>r</i>) to the <span class="italic">Origines</span>. However, his wife appears to have ended her life in relative poverty, dying in 1755 in Bishop Warner's College for Clergymen's Widows at Bromley. The <span class="italic">Origines</span> was translated into Latin and published by J. H. Grischovius of Halle between 1724 and 1729; a German abridgement was published in Augsburg between 1788 and 1796. <span class="italic">The Works of the Rev. Joseph Bingham</span>, edited by R. Bingham, was published in nine volumes in 1840, with a new edition in ten volumes in 1855.<br>
