<span class="headword">Oliver,  Thomas</span>  (1731/2&#150;1815), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, the son of Robert Oliver and Ann, daughter of James Brown of Antigua. His father was living in Antigua in 1738, but had settled at Dorchester before 1747. Thomas was educated at Harvard University, where he graduated in 1753. He probably resided at Dorchester until 1766, when he purchased an estate on Elmwood Avenue, near Mount Auburn, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and erected the mansion which was afterwards the residence of Governor Elbridge Gerry, and later the author and diplomatist James Russell Lowell. A man of fortune, he did not take much part in public affairs until March 1774, when he accepted the office of lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts. In addition he became the president of a council appointed by George III in a manner especially galling to popular feeling. Prior to Oliver's appointment existing councillors had been visited by bands of Middlesex freeholders, and one after another forced to renounce their offices. When royal troops seized the militia's stock of powder, the yeomen of the neighbouring towns marched to Cambridge, some of them bringing arms. Governor-General Thomas Gage prepared to send troops against them. After vainly endeavouring to persuade the yeomen to turn back, Oliver hastened to Boston and prevailed on Gage to refrain from military action. On his return the resignation of his seat on the council board was demanded. He urgently requested delay, inasmuch as he could not renounce that office while lieutenant-governor. A threatening multitude outside his residence on the morning of 2 September forced him to step down and to swear his commitment not to take any further part in the &#145;present novel and oppressive plan of the government&#146;. He left Cambridge immediately and never returned. He was accompanied by his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel John Vassall, whom he had married in 1760; the couple had several daughters. In 1775 he accompanied the British forces from Boston, and soon afterwards took passage from Halifax to England. He was proscribed in 1778 and his estate confiscated. Oliver died aged eighty-three at Bristol on 29 November 1815.<br>
