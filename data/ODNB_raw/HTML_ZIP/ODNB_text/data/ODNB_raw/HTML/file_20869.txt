<span class="headword">Osborn,  Elias</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1643, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born at Chillington, Somerset, where he was baptized on 24 June 1643, the son of Timothy Osborn; his mother, whose name is unknown, died when he was two years old. Osborn records in his autobiography that his parents &#145;were religious people, of those who were then called Puritans&#146;  (Osborn, 16), and that his father kept him at school and made him attend weekly lectures and repeat the substance of the sermon on the way home. Elias was, as he recalled, &#145;inclined to religion&#146; when he was thirteen, but also loved &#145;pleasure and vanity&#146;  (ibid., 18). At about fifteen he left school and was employed in the clothing trade. At the Restoration he records how &#145;I tried the common prayer, but was very soon weary of it, and indeed of all other religions that I then knew&#146;  (ibid., 19).<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen Osborn first heard of the Quakers, and after reading some of their books finally became &#145;convinced of the truth&#146;  (Osborn, 19). His father and other puritan relatives strongly opposed his conversion, and Osborn left home and began working in the clothing trade for a widow with two daughters, all of whom were Quakers. On 1 October 1665, at the age of twenty-two, Osborn married Mary Horte (<i>d</i>. 1675), the younger of the daughters. His father, though strongly objecting to this Quaker daughter-in-law, afterwards &#145;loved her dearly&#146;, and desired her to be buried by his side  (ibid., 21). Indeed, he eventually accepted his son's beliefs and &#145;came to have a love for Friends, and would sometimes go to meetings, which was a great comfort to me&#146;  (ibid., 29).<br>
<br>Osborn and his family entertained many travelling Friends at their home in Chillington, but began to feel the brunt of persecution in the 1670s. In 1670 Osborn and his mother-in-law were imprisoned at the suit of Lord Paulet's steward for non-payment of tithes, and their goods were seized more than once for the same cause. After the passage of the 1670 <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, Osborn remembered, &#145;the nation seemed all of a flame&#146; and the &#145;worst of men let loose to ruin honest neighbours by a law&#146;  (Osborn, 23). A large monthly meeting at Stoke Gregory was the first in the area to be broken up, and other meetings were disturbed, chiefly by Henry Waldron, a JP and militia captain who employed informers and illegally consigned numbers of Quakers from meetings as &#145;rioters&#146; and &#145;conventiclers&#146;  (ibid., 25). Osborn and some others procured a counsel to plead their case and defeated Waldron at quarter sessions. Some land was then bought and a large meeting-house built at Ilminster, 3 miles from Chillington, mainly at the expense of Osborn and his family.<br>
<br>In 1673 Osborn moved to Chard, where he continued to suffer frequently from distraints on his property. On 12 July 1675 his wife died, leaving four children. About three years later, in 1678, he married Mary Smith, with whom he had a further three children. Of the seven children, the eldest son, Elias, born at Chillington on 15 June 1668, settled at Bristol and died there on 3 August 1703, and the second son, Timothy, born on 30 April 1670, died at Ilminster on 15 November 1704.<br>
<br>On 23 September 1680, the day appointed for the Somerset quarterly meeting at Ilchester, the Friends met in the house of an innkeeper named Abbott, as the house usually rented by them from the gaolkeeper was full of prisoners. After the meeting for worship they had divided as usual for separate business meetings&#151;women upstairs, men below&#151;when Captain Waldron appeared with his troop, took down many names, and, treating the assembly as two conventicles, fined Abbott &pound;40. Assisted by Osborn and other Quakers, the innkeeper brought an action at common law against Waldron at Wells assizes, but without success. A month later Waldron went to Ilminster while Osborn was preaching, and carried him and sixty-nine others before Sir Edward Phillips. The group included Osborn's wife, who suffered a miscarriage as a result of the turmoil. Phillips fortunately allowed Osborn time to explain the case, so that only he and a few others were committed to prison. They appeared at Bath and were remanded until the next sessions, but through the influence of Lord Fitzhardinge, who represented that the Quakers were clothiers and large employers of labour, were released. Osborn was returned to prison, but allowed considerable liberty and discharged at the next sessions. On 28 April 1685 Osborn and three Somerset Quakers drew up an address to the county MPs in which they outlined the ill treatment of Friends, quoting the declaration of Breda as a guarantee for liberty of conscience, apparently to no effect.<br>
<br>After his release Osborn continued preaching around the villages of Somerset, whose inhabitants joined the Quakers in large numbers. He held a meeting of 500 people in the market-house of Wellington, and in Devon at Spiceland, Collumpton, Okehampton, and Crediton. He was prominent in the local business meetings of the Society of Friends as well as in the quarterly meeting, and he was often chosen to represent his county at the yearly meeting in London. He was evidently well liked in these circles, for a testimony by the quarterly meeting written after his death described him as &#145;a great and good man&#146;, who was &#145;well gifted in the ministry&#146; and &#145;of good service&#146; in meetings for business  (Osborn, 4&#150;7).<br>
<br>On 26 October 1711, aged sixty-eight, Osborn completed his autobiography, published after his death as <span class="italic">A Brief Narrative of the Life, Labours and Sufferings of Elias Osborn</span> (1723). On 13 December 1718 he wrote of his inability through age and deafness to be present at the funeral of William Penn, of whom he said, &#145;I can truly say, that I never loved any man better on a religious or civil account&#146;  (Osborn, 121). Osborn died on 29 June 1720 in his own house at Chard, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground there on 5 July.<br>
