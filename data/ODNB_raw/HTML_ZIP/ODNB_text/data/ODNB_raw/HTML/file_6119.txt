<span class="headword">Conway <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Finch]</span>,  Anne</span>, Viscountess Conway and Killultagh  (1631&#150;1679), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 14 December 1631, the posthumous and second surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9432/', "Heneage Finch (1580&#150;1631)")</script>, former speaker of the House of Commons, who predeceased her birth by a week, and of his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Cradock and widow of Richard Bennett, and was the half-sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9433/', "Heneage Finch (1621&#150;1682)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9439/', "John Finch (1626&#150;1682)")</script>. Little is known about Anne's upbringing and education. A good part of it was spent at home in the house that is now Kensington Palace. Anne's aptitude for learning must have been obvious, and her desire to study philosophy resulted in arrangements being made through her brother, John Finch, for her to receive instruction from his Cambridge tutor, the Cambridge Platonist Henry More [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94274', "Cambridge Platonists")</script>]. Since, as a woman, she was not able to attend the university, More instructed her by letter. This early tutorial relationship, which commenced in 1650, subsequently blossomed into a lifelong friendship which afforded Anne intellectual companionship unmatched for a woman of her generation. On 11 February 1651 Anne married at Kensington <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39681/', "Edward Conway (c.1623&#150;1683)")</script>, the eldest son of the second Viscount Conway and Killultagh, who owned estates in Warwickshire and Ulster, at Portmore. Her husband's efforts in opposing the Irish uprising had helped to secure his family's fortunes in the immediate aftermath of the English civil war, and on the death of his father on 26 June 1655, he became third Viscount Conway. After the Restoration he played an active part in English and in Irish politics. The couple had only one child, a son, Heneage, who was born on 6 February 1658 but died of smallpox on 14 October 1660.<br>
<br>The first part of Anne's married life was spent in London (where Lord Conway owned a house in Queen Street) and at Ragley Hall in Warwickshire (the Conway family seat). From 1661 to 1664 she visited Ireland. Chronic illness, however, took its toll, increasingly curtailing her movements. Her illness took the form of repeated bouts of chronic pain which grew more severe and more frequent as she got older. The main symptom was a headache, but her whole body was affected during these episodes, which first occurred when she was only twelve. She sought the advice of the leading medical practitioners of her time, including Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne, William Harvey, and Thomas Willis. An account of her symptoms is given, anonymously, by Willis in his <span class="italic">De anima brutorum</span> (1672). In 1656 she travelled to Paris in the hope that trepanning might bring relief, but she was dissuaded from going through with the operation. In 1666 her husband persuaded the healer Valentine Greatrakes, known as the &#145;Irish stroker&#146;, to visit her, but he had no more success than the other physicians she consulted. The increasing severity of her illness meant that, for the last years of her life, she was confined to her home, Ragley Hall.<br>
<br>Her semi-retired way of life notwithstanding, Lady Conway was able to pursue her interest in philosophy. Her husband appears to have encouraged her in her intellectual pursuits. At all events, marrying into the Conway family made her the mistress of one of the largest private libraries in England. In spite of the disabling effects of her illness, she was at the centre of a lively intellectual circle. The most significant figure in this group was Henry More, with whom she kept up a correspondence when he could not visit her in person. Through More, Lady Conway had contact with others of the Cambridge Platonists, including Ralph Cudworth and John Worthington. From 1666 to 1672, Elizabeth Foxcroft, the sister of Benjamin Whichcote, lived with her as her companion. In Ireland she enjoyed the company of Jeremy Taylor, of whom Lord Conway was chief patron, and of George Rust.<br>
<br>It was Lady Conway's search for a cure for her illness that brought her into contact with Francis Mercury Van Helmont, son of the Flemish biologist and natural philosopher, who first met her in 1670 when he was visiting England on a mission on behalf of Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia. Van Helmont returned to become a member of Lady Conway's household for the last years of her life. He awakened her interest in studying Jewish cabbala, bringing her into contact with the German cabbalist scholar Christian Knorr von Rosenroth. Van Helmont also had a profound influence on her religious life. Through him she encountered Quakerism. During her last years she was visited by the Quaker leaders George Fox, Robert Barclay, George Keith, and William Penn. She used her influence to help imprisoned members of their following. She converted to Quakerism just before her death, despite opposition from Henry More and her own family. When she died on 23 February 1679, Van Helmont preserved her body in a glass coffin. Contrary to her express wish not to be given a Church of England funeral, she was buried in the family vault at Arrow church, Warwickshire, according to the Anglican rite.<br>
<br>For a woman of her time, Anne Conway had unusual opportunities to pursue her interest in philosophy, but she treated it as very much a private activity and never wrote for publication. After her death a manuscript treatise was discovered among her effects. This was published anonymously in a Latin translation with the title, <span class="italic">Principia philosophiae antiquissimae et recentissimae</span> in Amsterdam in 1690 under the auspices of Van Helmont who wrote a short preface for it. An English translation by J. C. was published, also anonymously, in London in 1692, with the title, <span class="italic">The Principles of the most Ancient and Modern Philosophy</span>. This treatise clearly shows her acquaintance with contemporary philosophy as well as the impact of her cabbalistic studies. Her <span class="italic">Principia</span> outlines an original metaphysical system according to which all created things are constituted of monads of spiritual substance deriving from God. She proposes a tripartite hierarchy of being where the infinite monads of created substance express the infinity of the divine creator, and where causality is mediated through an intermediate level of being that participates in both the divine and created being. Since God is essentially good, so too is his creation. Conway denies the eternity of hell, arguing for a perfective order of things. In the course of her discussion she attacks the dualism of Descartes and Henry More, and the materialism of Hobbes and Spinoza. As a theodicy and monadology, her system anticipates the philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. It is certain that Leibniz knew of the work, and indeed possessed a copy (probably the gift of their mutual friend, Van Helmont).<br>
