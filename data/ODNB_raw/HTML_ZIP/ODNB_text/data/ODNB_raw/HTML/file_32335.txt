<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cecil,  (Edgar Algernon) Robert  Gascoyne-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lord Robert Cecil]</span>, Viscount Cecil of Chelwood  (1864&#150;1958), <span class="occ">politician and peace campaigner</span>, always best-known as Lord Robert Cecil, was born on 14 September 1864 at 11 Duchess Street, Portland Place, London, the third son in the family of five sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32339/', "Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, third marquess of Salisbury (1830&#150;1903)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Georgina Caroline Alderson (<i>d</i>. 1899).<h2>
<a name="Educationthebarandmarriage"></a>Education, the bar, and marriage</h2>As the son of a long-serving Conservative prime minister, Lord Robert Cecil inherited a party affiliation which, though reinforced by his devout high-Anglicanism, was in conflict with his progressive political instincts. As his nephew Lord David Cecil observed, he &#145;lacked his father's melancholy and scepticism&#146;, being instead &#145;sanguine and positive and impetuous like his mother&#146;  (D. Cecil, 294). He was educated by governesses and tutors at home until he was thirteen, a segregating experience which, though congenial, may have contributed to the individualism and propensity to resign which were to mark his political career. He then spent four not very agreeable years at Eton College, followed by another spell with a private tutor, after which, in January 1883, he went to University College, Oxford, where he flourished, becoming friendly with Edward Grey (the future Liberal foreign secretary), being elected to the Canning Club, speaking at the Oxford Union Society, playing real tennis against Cambridge, and taking a second in jurisprudence in 1886.<br>
<br>Cecil was employed for the next two years as his father's private secretary, during which time he was called to the bar (Inner Temple) in 1887. He established himself comfortably as a barrister, specializing in parliamentary work but also publishing a joint work on the principles of commercial law in 1891, and took silk in 1900. He also made a successful marriage in 1889 to Lady Eleanor Lambton (1868&#150;1959), daughter of George Frederick D'Arcy Lambton, second earl of Durham: their relationship was always close, despite her almost complete loss of hearing from the age of about twenty-six; she died five months to the day after he did. In addition to maintaining a succession of London residences of increasingly fashionable location, of which 16 South Eaton Place was the apogee, they built a modest country house, which they called Gale on account of its exposed location, at Chelwood Gate, between East Grinstead and Uckfield, in Sussex: surviving a Luftwaffe bomb which fell just outside its front door in November 1940, it remained their best-loved home for more than half a century.<h2>
<a name="Unionistfreetrader"></a>Unionist free-trader</h2>Cecil's political career began when he was returned as Conservative MP for Marylebone East at the 1906 general election. He soon made his mark as a diligent opposition back-bencher, though he was uneasy about the direction his party was taking: he was a free-trader, albeit of the moderate kind that accepted the case for retaliatory duties, and with a landowner's disdain for the rising commercial wing of his party dismissed tariff reform as &#145;a rather sordid attempt to ally Imperialism with State assistance for the rich&#146;  (R. Cecil, <span class="italic">All the Way</span>, 244). He was also a supporter of women's suffrage on the same basis as men's and of industrial co-partnership; and he disapproved of the rejection of the People's Budget by the House of Lords. Fear of opposition from tariff reformers within his constituency association caused him to quit East Marylebone; and at the two general elections of 1910 he unsuccessfully contested Blackburn and the Wisbech division of Cambridgeshire respectively, before winning a by-election for the Hitchin division of Hertfordshire in November 1911 as a Unionist free-trader.<h2>
<a name="WarcabinetandtheLeagueofNations"></a>War cabinet and the League of Nations</h2>Too old to enlist when the First World War broke out, Cecil worked for the Red Cross in France, helping to organize its department of wounded and missing, an experience which helped to persuade him that war prevention was &#145;the only political object worth while&#146;  (R. Cecil, <span class="italic">A Great Experiment</span>, 189). When Asquith broadened his Liberal government into a coalition in May 1915, Cecil entered it as parliamentary under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, a post he held for over four years, and was also sworn of the privy council. He joined the cabinet in February 1916 with the additional title of minister for blockade; and, despite disapproving of Lloyd George, who replaced Asquith as prime minister in December of that year, he remained in office under him, though the cabinet was replaced by a small war cabinet of which he was not a member. Cecil's experience of administering the blockade persuaded him that economic sanctions could prove a powerful yet non-military means of enforcing international law. The creation of a league of nations had become progressive opinion's leading war aim; and Cecil, who regarded his support for it as a logical development of the respect for the concert of Europe shown by his father, became the first ministerial convert to the league idea. He circulated a Foreign Office paper on the subject in September 1916, and thereafter pressed determinedly for a governmental commitment to it, though he did not join the League of Nations Society. He was promoted to the rank of assistant secretary of state for foreign affairs in June 1918, thereby becoming deputy to his cousin A. J. Balfour, but formally resigned from the government on 21 November 1918 because as a loyal Anglican&#151;who indeed had co-authored a book entitled <span class="italic">Our National Church</span> in 1913&#151;he opposed the disestablishment of the Welsh church, which was due to be implemented once the war was over.<br>
<br>None the less Cecil stayed in office on a caretaker basis and was re-elected at the December 1918 general election as a coalition Conservative. In January 1919 he finally left the Foreign Office to take up an appointment as adviser on league issues to Britain's delegation at the Paris peace conference, where he played an important part in establishing the League of Nations and shaping its covenant&#151;unquestionably the most significant achievement of his career.<br>
<br>This work having been completed by the summer of 1919, Cecil severed his governmental links. He agreed to represent South Africa at the first three League of Nations assemblies (1920&#150;22). With British politics in flux owing to the continuation of the coalition government, the Liberal split, and Labour's advance, he came close to changing parties. He sent a message of support to Asquith when he contested a by-election at Paisley in February 1920&#151;a gesture which proved controversial when a coalition Conservative decided to stand and lost his deposit&#151;and also tried to persuade Grey to offer himself as the leader of a new party of the centre. After Austen Chamberlain became Conservative leader in March 1921, Cecil lost the party whip and moved to the opposition benches. Moreover, although he was regarded as the official Conservative candidate in the 1922 general election, which followed the collapse of the coalition, he described himself in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as an independent Conservative.<h2>
<a name="LeagueofNationsUnionandConservativecabinets"></a>League of Nations Union and Conservative cabinets</h2>Meanwhile, instead of returning to the law Cecil devoted an increasing amount of his time to the League of Nations Union (LNU), which had been formed in November 1918 as a merger of the League of Nations Society and a rival body, the League of Free Nations Association. Cecil became its acknowledged leader: he took over from Professor Gilbert Murray, with whom he was to develop a strong working relationship, as chairman of its executive committee in June 1919; and he made his first public appearance on an LNU platform the following month. As an influential Conservative, he brought the LNU authority and respectability, helping it to develop into one of Britain's most remarkable voluntary associations, with more than 400,000 paid-up members at its peak in 1931. Moreover, as a political maverick with great confidence in his own judgement, he was willing to insist that the LNU do more than educate the public in league principles, as its general secretary Maxwell Garnett merely wished it to do. Cecil wanted the LNU to press successive British governments to be more supportive of the League of Nations even at the risk of being thought &#145;political&#146;. In 1922, for example, he persuaded the LNU to oppose Lloyd George's proposed bilateral pact with France, as a relapse into the old diplomacy, and to support a strengthening of the league's security provisions through a draft treaty of mutual assistance instead.<br>
<br>Though omitted from Bonar Law's government in November 1922, Cecil was made cabinet minister responsible for league affairs, with the title of lord privy seal, when Baldwin took over as prime minister in May 1923, though he was not allowed to base himself in the Foreign Office. He handed the chairmanship of the LNU's executive committee back to Murray, but became its president in 1923, at first jointly with Grey, an office he held for the remainder of the LNU's existence (until 1945). The tension between his positions as minister and leader of a major pressure group did not have time to become acute in 1923: Baldwin failed to receive the mandate for protection which he sought in a general election in December, and resigned the following month. Cecil, who had refused to seek re-election on a protectionist programme, went to the House of Lords as the first&#151;and, being childless, only&#151;Viscount Cecil of Chelwood (24 December 1923).<br>
<br>Rumours that Viscount Cecil might join the first Labour government proved to be unfounded. But when Baldwin returned to office in November 1924, Cecil was reappointed to the cabinet, this time with the title of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, though once again excluded from the Foreign Office. Baldwin presumably hoped that Cecil would be tamed by office; but instead he was irritated by his lack of influence within the government, and by 21 March 1926 was complaining to the prime minister: &#145;I cannot remain as a kind of guarantee to supporters of the League in the country, that the policy they so much desire is safe, unless I am given some means of delivering the goods&#146;  (Middlemas and Barnes, 360). What Cecil saw as his colleagues' foot-dragging approach to arbitration and disarmament caused him to resign on 9 August 1927; and though, in response to entreaties from Austen Chamberlain, Cecil's resignation letter was progressively toned down in the course of five drafts, it none the less embarrassed the government. Moreover, he followed his resignation with an LNU campaign over the autumn and winter of 1927&#150;8 which even Murray feared might seem anti-Conservative. And in the 1929 general election Cecil urged the electorate to ignore party considerations and vote only for pro-league candidates.<h2>
<a name="ThePeaceBallot"></a>The Peace Ballot</h2>Cecil was rewarded by being appointed by the second MacDonald government as a British delegate to the League of Nations: he was given a room at the Foreign Office, and enjoyed excellent relations there with Arthur Henderson and his junior ministers Hugh Dalton and Philip Noel Baker (this last having at one time been Cecil's private secretary). When this administration fell in the financial crisis of 1931 he felt obliged to support the National Government which replaced it, and so stayed on as a league delegate. However, in the light of the new ministry's half-hearted policy on the issue he declined to represent Britain at the World Disarmament Conference, which opened at Geneva in February 1932.<br>
<br>The collapse of that conference in October 1933, when Germany also gave notice of leaving the league, produced a vocal anti-Geneva reaction among both left and right in Britain. Cecil's challenge to this essentially isolationist response led to his most impressive campaigning achievement. The <span class="italic">Ilford Recorder</span>, whose editor was chairman of his LNU branch, had run a local poll which suggested that public opinion was more pro-league than politicians realized; and this result was confirmed by a number of other local newspapers. Cecil persuaded the LNU to hold a national poll on the same lines: a prodigious organizational feat as well as a major financial and political gamble, the National Declaration on the League of Nations Union and Armaments (or Peace Ballot, as it was colloquially known) secured responses from 38 per cent of the adult population between November 1934 and June 1935. These revealed not only overwhelming support for the league but also majority support for military sanctions, though Cecil later privately conceded that not enough emphasis had been placed on the latter in LNU propaganda prior to 1936. The success of the Peace Ballot encouraged the National Government to support the application of mild economic sanctions against Italy when it attacked Abyssinia and to take a pro-league line in the November 1935 general election. It also caused it to dismiss its foreign secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, the following month when a leak of his discussions with his French opposite number revealed that he was privately seeking a deal with Mussolini.<h2>
<a name="InternationalPeaceCampaignandNobelpeaceprize"></a>International Peace Campaign and Nobel peace prize</h2>However, Cecil's greatest triumph led directly to his greatest frustration. The Peace Ballot highlighted the weakness of efforts to arouse pro-league sentiment in Europe. When, as an offshoot of popular-front politics, a collective security campaign known as the Rassemblement Universel pour la Paix was launched in France in the autumn of 1935, Cecil was determined that the British league movement support the continental initiative in order to lend it some of its own prestige. However, when extended to Britain in 1936 under the name International Peace Campaign (IPC), the Rassemblement ran into three difficulties. First, its timing was unlucky: the league was discredited in the spring of 1936 by its inability to stop Mussolini conquering Abyssinia, with the result that many former supporters of collective security began to advocate appeasement instead. Second, the IPC duplicated the LNU's work and drew funds away from it at a time when these were anyway drying up because of the league's unpopularity. Third, its communist links offended the labour movement and the Roman Catholic church in particular.<br>
<br>Cecil underestimated these difficulties, and hinted at resignation if the LNU did not co-operate with the IPC. The LNU agreed to do so, but despite several attempts failed to work out a satisfactory constitutional relationship to the new body. Cecil grew irritated, and suggested that the Nobel peace prize which he was awarded in 1937 was a tribute to the IPC rather than to the LNU. At that year's LNU staff Christmas party he was further enraged by a satirical sketch written by a Catholic member of staff known to dislike the IPC which depicted him as not only fanatical about the IPC but also senile. In the ensuing row he forced the LNU's general secretary, Garnett, to resign.<br>
<br>However, for all Cecil's exertions, and those of loyal associates in the LNU such as Noel Baker, the IPC failed to make headway in Britain, either as a committee of the LNU, or as an independent body on which the LNU was represented on the same basis as other supportive associations, or even (in a desperate last throw) as a wholly separate organization. In 1939 Cecil wearily resigned as president of the IPC's British national committee (though he remained co-president with Pierre Cot of its parent body). He was to experience further disillusionment when as a result of the Molotov&#150;Ribbentrop pact the IPC's communist element revealed its true loyalties by trying to turn the IPC against collective security in line with Soviet policy; and by the end of 1940 the IPC and its parent body had both, in effect, collapsed. Within Britain, Cecil's preoccupation with the IPC had thus hindered rather than helped the campaign for British rearmament and the containment of Germany, to which he was fully committed from 1936 onwards. And although on the continent the Rassemblement had made more political impact, it too ultimately failed.<h2>
<a name="SecondWorldWarandafter"></a>Second World War and after</h2>A further tribulation for Cecil was that during 1939&#150;40 the younger generation of British and American internationalists lost faith in confederal organizations such as the league and became converted to federalism. They therefore devoted their energies to a new organization, Federal Union, rather than to the LNU. Cecil remained doggedly loyal to the latter, however, and towards the end of the Second World War was rewarded by the revival of the confederal cause in the form of the allied agreement to replace the defunct league with a somewhat similar United Nations Organization. By his eightieth birthday in 1944 he was honoured by public praise from Winston Churchill, who also made a warm speech when the Royal Institute of International Affairs presented Cecil with a bust. He was invited to the final session of the league assembly at Geneva in the spring of 1946, where he ended his speech with the phrase: &#145;The League is dead; long live the United Nations&#146;.<br>
<br>Thereafter Cecil's public work was virtually over. He was made an honorary life president of the United Nations Association, which succeeded the LNU without achieving anything like the same public support. In 1948 he wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">An Emergency Policy</span>, warning of the need for a western union against the Soviet threat. And on 23 April 1953, in what turned out to be his last speech in the House of Lords, he argued that &#145;Christian civilisation is the only real alternative to dialectical materialism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 181, 1953, 1159). In 1956 he was made a Companion of Honour.<br>
<br>Cecil, who from the late 1930s was increasingly deaf, was very tall, with a pronounced stoop, prominent eyes, a mobile and expressive face, an eagle-like profile, and a forehead which became more pronounced as his hair receded. Throughout his career he was in demand for honorific positions, and at various times served as chancellor of Birmingham University, rector of Aberdeen University, and visitor of St Hugh's College, Oxford. He died at the Lonsdale Nursing Home, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 24 November 1958. Paying tribute to him in the House of Lords two days later, the fourteenth earl of Home, whose father had been a league supporter prior to 1936, recalled of Cecil's visits to his home that<blockquote>many a time at dinner &hellip; I would watch him, with his long figure, slide more and more under the table, until only the distinguished head was left above his plate, and he would tell us all of his plans for the future peace of the world. (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 212, 1958, 838)</blockquote>
