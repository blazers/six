<span class="headword">Cross,  Charles Frederick</span>  (1855&#150;1935), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 11 December 1855 at Brentford, Middlesex, the second son of Charles James Cross JP, of Brentford, who was at first a schoolmaster and later a director of T. B. Rowe &amp; Sons, soap makers, of Brentford, and his wife, Ella Mendham. He was educated at King's College, London where he graduated BSc in 1878, and spent some time at Z&uuml;rich university and polytechnic and Owens College, Manchester. He thus had two outstanding teachers&#151;Georg Lunge in Z&uuml;rich and H. E. Roscoe in Manchester. Thereafter he devoted his life to the field of cellulose technology. After early work on jute fibre in Barrow in Furness and Kew, in 1885 he set up in business in Lincoln's Inn in partnership with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37190/', "Edward J. Bevan")</script>, his fellow student at Manchester, as analytical and consulting chemists. In 1890 he married Edith Vernon, daughter of Major-General Charles Roper Stainforth, Madras cavalry. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Cross's popular reputation was based upon his discovery in 1892 of viscose, which made possible the manufacture of artificial silk, afterwards called rayon, and was also used in the manufacture of photographic film. His achievement was no less esteemed by chemists. The discovery consisted in treating cellulose with aqueous caustic soda and then with carbon bisulphide, producing a golden yellow viscous liquid. This liquid when projected or spun through fine nozzles into a precipitating bath of sulphuric acid yielded fibres. These, after further treatment to remove the sulphur, left a pure regenerated cellulose. Initially, his interest in the fibre was not as a new textile but as a basis for the fine filaments needed for the newly developed electric lamp. Cross's patent remained a chemical master patent for its full term of years and was extended for a further term in view of its outstanding merit. It was soon worked throughout the world, and over the years 1893&#150;1900 his process was developed through proprietary companies in London, Breslau, and Paris. With C. H. Stearn he founded the Viscose Spinning Syndicate, which developed the spinning of artificial silk. This was later acquired by Courtaulds.<br>
<br>Cross was also a pioneer in the production of transparent viscose films (cellophane), used in huge quantities by the packaging industry. In addition he initiated the production of cellulose acetate, later associated in the public mind with the name Celanese: he took out the first industrial patent for its manufacture in 1894. Although less spectacular than his discovery of viscose, this work was likewise of remarkable influence, in the development of the paper trade.<br>
<br>Cross, who was far ahead of his time in working with a substance so unusual in its chemical behaviour, never ceased to be actively interested in the theoretical as well as the practical chemistry of cellulose. When he began his research its chemical identity was obscure: by the 1920s his work had contributed largely to elucidating the basic features of its structure. He published his researches in book form as well as in contributions to scientific journals. His book <span class="italic">Cellulose</span> (written in collaboration with Bevan, 1895) is unique, full of imagination and stimulating ideas. He also published four volumes of <span class="italic">Researches on Cellulose</span> (1901&#150;22), the first three in collaboration with Bevan, the last with Charles Dor&eacute;e. Although he achieved so much on the technical side, at heart he was a scientist, chiefly interested in the pursuit of pure knowledge.<br>
<br>Cross was elected FRS in 1917, with the unusual citation, &#145;as the founder of a great industry &hellip; based on scientific work&#146; (Royal Society Election Certificate). He was awarded the medal of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1916, the research medal of the Dyers' Company in 1918, and in 1924 the Perkin medal of the Society of Dyers and Colourists, of which he was president (1918&#150;20). Owing to ill health he retired to Hove about eight years before his death. He was fortunate in his artistic temperament and happy in his musical gifts&#151;he was an organist of ability. A man of striking appearance, cultured, and with broad interests, he was widely popular. He died at his home, 4C King's Gardens, Hove, Sussex, on 15 April 1935.<br>
