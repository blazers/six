</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lingard,  John</span>  (1771&#150;1851), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and historian</span>, only son of John Lingard (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1804), a carpenter and builder, and his wife, Elizabeth Reynolds (<i>c</i>.1733&#150;1824), was born in Winchester on 5 February 1771. He was one of the last students to study at the English College, Douai, in northern France, caught up as it was in events following the French Revolution. Lingard arrived there at the age of eleven in 1782 and left for Britain a few days after the French <i>commissaires</i> had taken possession of the college in 1793. Eventually he joined the handful of northern exiles which settled at Crook Hall, near Durham. Lingard was ordained deacon there in December 1794, and priest at the Bar Convent in York on 18 April 1795. At Crook he took on various administrative and academic tasks and moved with the community to the new buildings at Ushaw, Durham, in 1808. In 1810 he became acting president but a year of &#145;anxiety and misery&#146;  (Lingard to Bishop Poynter, 26 Feb 1817, CUL, Add. MS 9418), peppered by unnecessary interference from Bishop Gibson, convinced him that college life was not for him; he refused invitations to St Edmund's College, Ware, and to Maynooth. He was grateful for the chance of moving in 1811 to the small Catholic mission in Hornby, Lancashire, where he remained until his death in 1851.<br>
<br>Here Lingard not only wrote his major <span class="italic">History of England</span> (London, 1819&#150;30), a study of English history from the Roman invasion to 1688, but a host of smaller works of history and theology, including a collection of English prayers for the use of his parishioners (1833), an English translation of the gospels (1836), and a volume of catechetical instruction (1840). Lingard's version of the <span class="italic">Ave maris stella</span>, &#145;Hail queen of heaven&#146;, remains a popular hymn among Roman Catholics. In 1820, out of the profits of the first volumes of his <span class="italic">History</span>, Lingard built a simple Catholic chapel, adjoining the priest's house in Hornby. He preferred liturgy to be intelligible and attractive both to the Catholic community and to protestant visitors, disliking repetitious litanies and over-fanciful metaphor. He wanted his congregation to understand and follow the priest's prayers at the altar and, in Holy Week, for example, had someone read the <span class="roman">Passion</span> clearly in English while he continued quietly in Latin. Above all, he wanted simplicity, and disdained both the medievalism of Pugin's Gothic revival and the unwarranted pomp that often accompanied the opening of churches, with the church being &#145;turned into an opera house&#146; and &#145;the bishop performing as the first dancer in the ballet&#146;  (Lingard to John Walker, 16 Nov 1843, Ushaw, LL 1361). His vast and delightfully unbuttoned correspondence reveals him as an important commentator on Catholic life during the first half of the nineteenth century. He was a valued adviser to vicars apostolic as well as to laity; his work represented an important contribution to the political programme of the English Catholics petitioning for emancipation.<br>
<br>To strangers Lingard could be somewhat off-putting but he delighted in his friends. A regular visitor to Hornby in the last years of Lingard's life described him as<blockquote>a thin, spare, light-figured, sallow, dark complexioned man, about 5ft 9in, or 5ft 10in in height, with remarkably small feet and small hands, and apparently of delicate constitution &hellip; [looking] quite as old at 65 as he did at eighty, with the exception of the whitening ring often seen in the eyes of old people. (Mrs Thomas Lomax, unpublished memoir, priv. coll.)</blockquote>Everything in the house was &#145;small and of the neatest&#146;  (ibid.). Lingard was a keen gardener, &#145;a great grafter of pear trees&#146;  (ibid.), and was proud of the oaks he grew from acorns gathered once in Italy. He boasted a series of pets, including a tortoise and a guinea fowl. To Mrs Lomax, he was, above all, friend and scholar, &#145;his sacerdotal character never particularly present[ing] itself to me, unless I happened to be there on a Sunday&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Lingard rarely travelled, though he went to Rome in 1817, both in search of manuscripts and to assist in negotiations for the reopening of the English College after the devastations of Napoleon. In 1821 Pius VII conferred on him the triple degrees of doctor of divinity and of civil and canon law and gradually he achieved European acclaim, his <span class="italic">History of England</span> being published in French, German, and Italian editions. He became an associate of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1839 was elected a corresponding member of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise. Leo XII presented him with a gold medal on a return visit to Rome in 1825, and invited him to stay in the city, but Lingard preferred to return to his historical studies in the seclusion of Hornby. It was rumoured that Leo had created Lingard a cardinal <i>in petto</i> in the consistory of October 1826. This is a secret which died with the pope but, in the more expansive mood of old age, Lingard considered it to have been the case. The issue was raised again after Lingard's death by Mark Tierney (historian and priest of the Southwark diocese, who was Lingard's first memoirist) in a sharp exchange with Cardinal Wiseman, who, though acknowledging himself to be close to Lingard, his old teacher, was anxious to scotch the idea. The same official unease pervades a guarded obituary of Lingard in <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> (26 July 1851), written from a decidedly ultramontanist perspective. This is fighting new battles on old ground: Wiseman was not prepared to concede additional ammunition to Tierney's championing of the Cisalpine tradition, for which Tierney claimed Lingard as a leading representative.<br>
<br>Like many Catholics, Lingard had contact with whig circles, for the whigs had for long espoused the cause of Catholic emancipation. It was Lord Holland who had encouraged Joseph Mawman to publish the first edition of the <span class="italic">History of England</span>, and Henry Brougham was a welcome visitor to Hornby, when travelling north for the Lancaster assizes. Lord Melbourne made him a grant from the public purse in 1839 of &pound;300, and Lingard forwarded Ullathorne's <span class="italic">The Catholic Mission in Australia</span> to a select committee on transportation, resulting in Ullathorne's call to give useful evidence before the committee in 1838. Lingard was no whig, however. The volumes of his <span class="italic">History</span> dealing with the Reformation provided material for the blatant anti-Anglican polemic of William Cobbett's <span class="italic">The Protestant Reformation</span> (1824&#150;7), which betrays Lingard's subtle undermining of the prevailing protestant interpretation. John Allen, a close associate of the Holland House circle, could only alight on a footnote regarding the St Bartholomew's day massacre as grounds for a vigorous attack on Lingard in the pages of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, an attack which provoked Lingard to one of his very few public responses, <span class="italic">A Vindication of Certain Passages in the Fourth and Fifth Volumes of the History of England</span> (1826).<br>
<br>Correspondence reveals that Lingard thought little of the whig historians, and described Macaulay's work as &#145;abound[ing] in claptrap of every description&#146;  (Lingard to John Walker, 27 Dec 1848, Ushaw, LL 1296). Lingard set out his programme in the preface to his <span class="italic">Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</span>, clearly distancing himself from whig history: &#145;my object is truth; and in the pursuit of truth I have made it a religious duty to consult the original historians. Who would draw from the troubled stream, when he may drink at the fountainhead?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</span>, 1806, 1.vi). It was a programme he stuck to, searching out manuscripts and relying on colleagues to do the same. Lingard was the first English historian to make serious use of rare printed material and manuscript sources in the Vatican and other Italian libraries, as well as French dispatches, and material from the state papers of Ferdinand and Isabella and Philip II of Spain preserved in an almost inaccessible state in the Spanish castle of Simancas. The pioneering use of such material enabled him to move away from a tendency towards parochialism in English political history, placing it in a more broadly European context. The five editions of the <span class="italic">History</span> published during his lifetime allowed him to include new collections of sources as they were brought to his notice and set out a more explicit statement of Catholic revisionism than he had felt to be appropriate in the pre-emancipation years of the 1820s.<br>
<br>Lingard professed to acknowledge no interpretative scheme of history but sought to let the facts speak for themselves. His was a revisionist history: he considered this dry clarity, with its appearance of impartiality, to be the best way of serving the Catholic cause. This was not always accepted as the case: Bishop Milner, strident ultramontanist and vicar apostolic for the midland district since 1803, was particularly outspoken in his attacks. The pages of the <span class="italic">Orthodox Journal</span> chart the progress of this debate, although Rome intervened in April 1820 to demand that Milner sever his connection with the journal. Milner, and Lingard's other Catholic critics, objected to his eirenic approach to non-Catholics: Lingard numbered non-Catholics among his friends and correspondents, and struck up a close friendship with the local Anglican incumbent at Hornby, who, on his death, bequeathed his pets to Lingard's care, and rather unusually the Anglican church at Hornby has a memorial to the Catholic priest whose chapel was across the road.<br>
<br>Lingard, however, was not averse to formal controversy and published a series of pamphlets initiated by an attack made on Catholicism by Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham (<span class="italic">A collection of tracts on several subjects connected with the civil and religious principles of Catholics</span>, 1826). As in his historical work, Lingard felt the Catholic cause best served by a calm and conscientious statement of facts which would serve to disabuse opponents of misapprehensions. This almost na&iuml;ve, Enlightenment, belief in the power of fact, it must be conceded, was more a matter of Catholic apologetic than ecumenical intent. Lingard never warmed to the Oxford Movement, always remaining suspicious of its converts to Catholicism, and, in a long review of works by William Palmer of Worcester and of the early <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>, disputed the continuities claimed by these authors, praising the Catholic martyrs who had preserved the tradition handed on by Augustine and his companions  (<span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, May 1842).<br>
<br>Accusations regarding the illiberality of Roman Catholicism were addressed by Lingard in his first work, <span class="italic">The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</span> (1806), a work which reveals him to be a moderate upholder of the Catholic cisalpine and Gallican tradition of historical scholarship. In this work he sought to oppose the errors of a generation of protestant Anglo-Saxon scholars who argued for an English church, which was from the beginning independent from Rome. Against these writers Lingard asserts the catholicity of the Anglo-Saxon church, presenting a picture of a national church, guided by regular diocesan and provincial synods, but always absolutely loyal to the representative of St Peter. Lingard was anxious to show how Christianity brings culture and civilization, together with its promise of salvation, and was keen, quietly and subtly, to undermine arguments which suggest an aggressive approach to the English church on the part of Rome.<br>
<br>Impervious to the wiles of romanticism, Lingard's work belongs to the Enlightenment; his style is akin to that of Gibbon, though his irony is more gentle. As the nineteenth century progressed, Lingard appeared increasingly old-fashioned, though his <span class="italic">History</span> remained a standard English text for Catholics into the twentieth century. He disliked innovation, and looked askance at nineteenth-century theories of doctrinal development, and was always to emphasize the permanence and unchanging nature of the doctrine received from Christ by the apostolic community. Lingard's is a political history, cool towards the miraculous, cool towards heroes: his treatment of Thomas Becket was as irritating to Milner as was his treatment of William Wallace to his Scottish critics. His uncomplimentary characterizations of Henry VIII and Elizabeth emerge from the unfolding of events and Mary Tudor is equally disdained, though he does not dwell on her persecutions. Lingard's work looks back to the great tradition of historical scholarship and source criticism established by the Bollandists and Maurists and is consonant with the marked revival of historical study in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain. There is nothing more revealing of Lingard's somewhat tetchy eighteenth-century rationalism than a comment on Sharon Turner (1768&#150;1847), perhaps his closest contemporary among the British historians:<blockquote>To my surprise he has written to me a congratulatory letter &hellip; and has sent me as a present a poem which he has just published. Unfortunately that detracts from the compliment. For he is seventy-seven, and a man who publishes a poem in his seventy-seventh year must be on the high road to a second childhood. (Lingard to John Coulston, 10 June 1845, Ushaw, LL 290)</blockquote>Lingard outlived Turner, although troubled by worsening eyesight and increasing bouts of ill health. He walked in his garden for the last time on Easter Sunday 1851 and the following day took to his bed. Severe bouts of asthma in the last few weeks of his life made it more convenient to spend his days and nights propped up on the sofa in his library, and there he died just before midnight on 17 July 1851. At Lingard's own request his body was taken to Ushaw College, where he was buried on 22 July.<br>
