<span class="headword">Delaram,  Francis</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1615&#150;1624), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was a contemporary of Simon de Passe, with whom he dominated the London engraving trade in the second half of the reign of James I, putting an end to the near monopoly that had previously been held by Renold Elstrack. Nothing is known about his life apart from what can be deduced from his forty-seven surviving prints. The earliest of them is a portrait of James's botanist Matthias de Lobel, dated 1615, which is fully developed in style and among the best of his plates. This, and the fact that other plates are lettered &#145;Londini&#146;, suggests that Delaram had been trained abroad and had recently arrived in London. But if he was (as seems most likely on stylistic grounds) a Netherlander, no trace of his activity has been recorded in the Low Countries either before or after his time in London.<br>
<br>Most of Delaram's plates are title-pages and portraits, apparently after his own designs. He also made some of the first English books of flowers, beasts, and birds, and probably the first English drawing-book (of which no copy survives). Delaram worked for all the main London publishers of the day, including Compton Holland, Sudbury and Humble, Thomas Jenner, Roger Daniell, and Maurice Blount; he never published anything himself. His most interesting works are a portrait of Queen Elizabeth after Nicholas Hilliard, published with a royal privilege; this has always been linked with a licence that Hilliard was given in 1617 that gave him a monopoly of printed portraits of James I. Delaram's major plate, a very large portrait of James, published by Edward Pierson, is dated 1619, the year of Hilliard's death, and therefore after the expiry of his monopoly. Only one impression of it survives and is now in the British Museum.<br>
