<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  Allen</span>  (1809&#150;1884), <span class="occ">anatomist and embryologist</span>, was born on 2 April 1809 in Edinburgh, the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27316/', "John Thomson (1765&#150;1846)")</script>, surgeon, and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18716/', "John Millar (1735&#150;1801)")</script>, professor of jurisprudence at Glasgow University. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27329/', "William Thomson (1802&#150;1852)")</script> was his half-brother.<br>
<br>Allen Thomson's schooling took place at the high school of Edinburgh, after which, at his father's behest, he attended Edinburgh University from 1824 to study medicine. He also attended classes at the Edinburgh extramural medical school. He graduated MD from Edinburgh University in 1830. His graduation thesis was entitled &#145;De evolutione cordis in animalibus vertebratis&#146;, revealing his early interest in what was to become his life's work. As an undergraduate he was president of the Royal Medical Society. His father had a profound influence in Thomson's choice of career, and as it was Thomson senior's &#145;great desire that he should become a teacher of anatomy, and devote himself to anatomical and physiological pursuits&#146;  (Aitken, xiii), Thomson travelled to Europe to undertake further anatomical and physiological study, visiting anatomical and pathological collections in Amsterdam, Strasbourg, and Berlin.<br>
<br>Thomson returned to Edinburgh in 1831 and immediately took up teaching. He entered into partnership with William Sharpey, the two offering a course in anatomy and physiology. Sharpey taught the anatomical portion of the course, Thomson the physiological. Thomson became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1832. His partnership with Sharpey lasted until 1836, being interrupted in 1833 by a trip Thomson undertook with his father to London and Europe for further anatomical study. In London, some indication of the direction Allen Thomson was expected to take surfaced when he was introduced to Lord Melbourne by Lady Holland with the words &#145;Melbourne, allow me to introduce to you the future Professor of Anatomy in the University of Glasgow&#146;  (Aitken, xvi).<br>
<br>In 1836 the Sharpey&#150;Thomson partnership was dissolved because Sharpey had been appointed professor of anatomy at University College, London. Thomson gave up teaching temporarily at this time because of ill health. He entered the service of the duke of Bedford as physician to his family in that year, and remained in post until 1837, travelling with the family to the highlands in 1836 and 1837, and accompanying the duke on his European tour. Correspondence between Thomson and Sharpey during this period shows that Thomson had no intention of making ducal service his long-term career, and that he wished to resume teaching when he was able.<br>
<br>In session 1837&#150;8 Thomson began to teach again in Edinburgh, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of that city in 1838. On 4 September that year he married Nina Jane Hill (1810&#150;1893), daughter of Ninian Hill, writer to the signet, of Edinburgh, and sister of Thomson's half-brother William's wife, Eliza. They had one son. In 1839 Thomson was appointed professor of anatomy at Marischal College in Aberdeen. He remained at Marischal College until 1841, when he returned to Edinburgh as extramural lecturer in anatomy. His reasons for leaving Aberdeen are unclear, but he may not have been earning enough from his anatomy classes, which were small, and there has also been conjecture that he wished to return to Edinburgh to await the post of professor of the institutes of medicine (physiology) at the university becoming vacant. This it did in 1842, with the resignation of William Pulteney Alison, and Thomson was appointed to the post. One of the innovations he introduced on his return to Edinburgh was to use the microscope in the teaching of anatomy. He commenced a course of weekly lectures on microscopic anatomy in the summer of 1842.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Thomson was regarded as a great teacher, who utilized fully contemporary scientific advances in his lectures. Professor John Struthers of Aberdeen remarked that, &#145;his abilities as a teacher and observer were fully recognised by the medical profession of Edinburgh&#146;  (Struthers, 1154). Thomson was also possessed of great artistic talent, and his lectures were well illustrated by chalk drawings. His approach to lecturing was systematic and methodical, with perhaps his main fault being that he gave no clear lead to the students as to his own views when lecturing on areas which were the subject of much scientific debate. He was, however, very highly regarded by his students, in whom he had a great interest.<br>
<br>Thomson remained at Edinburgh until 1848, in which year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In that same year, after much intense politicking, he was appointed regius professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow in succession to Professor James Jeffray, who had held that chair since 1790. Under Jeffray the teaching of anatomy in the University of Glasgow had fallen into disrepute, but the arrival of Thomson reinvigorated the subject, and he introduced a more up-to-date view of anatomy, and of its teaching. Thomson's appointment did not meet with the complete approval of his fellow professors, who have been described as a &#145;notoriously conservative, self-perpetuating clique&#146;  (Jacyna, xxiv). Indeed Thomson was antipathetic to any suggestion of nepotism or favouritism in the appointment of chairs in Glasgow University and fought strongly against such means being used to fill the chair of chemistry, in 1852, and the regius chair of surgery, in 1859.<br>
<br>Thomson, as well as teaching, was much involved in the administration of Glasgow University during his time there. His greatest contribution to the university's welfare was made during its move from the High Street in the 1860s to Gilmorehill. In 1864 he was appointed convenor of the removal committee, charged with overseeing the move. On 6 June 1866 he cut the first sod at the new site in Gilmorehill. He was also one of the main planners in the construction of the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, opened in 1874. He represented Glasgow University on the General Medical Council from 1859 until 1877. In 1871 the University of Edinburgh conferred upon him the degree of LLD, as did Glasgow University in 1877. He was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University in 1882.<br>
<br>Anatomical and embryological research featured heavily in Thomson's life, and he made a number of original contributions to the scientific literature, although he made no one great eponymous discovery. He edited a number of textbooks, including the seventh, eighth, and ninth editions of Quain's <span class="italic">System of Human Anatomy</span>. In 1859 he also published a second edition of his father's <span class="italic">Life of William Cullen</span>.<br>
<br>Having held his professorship for twenty-nine years Thomson retired from Glasgow University in 1877 with the reputation &#145;throughout the scientific world as one of the most careful, judicious, accurate, and learned of investigators and teachers of his favourite subjects&#146;  (Aitken, xxii). He and his wife went to London to live with their son, John Millar Thomson. He remained in London until his death. Late in 1883 he suffered a short episode of glaucoma in his left eye for which an iridectomy was performed. Shortly after this, however, he lost the sight in his right eye. He began to suffer from local paralyses, which became more generalized. His breathing finally became obstructed, and he died on 21 March 1884 at his address, 66 Palace Terrace Gardens, Kensington, London, leaving a widow.<br>
