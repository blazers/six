<span class="headword">Pennyman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Angier]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1685, <em>d.</em> 1733), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 3 May 1685, the daughter of Barnet Angier of the City of Westminster, sometime carpenter to Charles II, and Jane Salter (or Slater). She is said to have been well educated and extraordinarily beautiful. In 1703 she eloped with Thomas Pennyman (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1669), of a good Yorkshire family, and was married on 18 June at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. Around this time, Thomas Pennyman came into an inheritance on the death of an elder brother. His wife brought him a fortune of &pound;2000, but the marriage was disastrous and the couple obtained a legal separation after only three months. She lost much of her fortune in the Mississippi scheme, having travelled to Paris to dispose of her stock in 1720. Her journey to Paris, undertaken with another young woman and two male relatives, is recorded in her journal, printed in the <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, by the Honourable Lady Margaret Pennyman</span>, published posthumously in September 1739 (dated 1740 on title-page). The journal, which makes no direct mention of any financial transactions, is a pedestrian account of the logistics of travel and Parisian tourist sites. Pennyman does mention seeing Louis XV at mass, and shows an interest in Catholic rites and ceremonies. The preface to this volume, probably by her publisher, the scandalmonger Edmund Curll, states that after returning from France, Pennyman lived reclusively until her death.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, a small octavo volume priced at a modest 3<i>s</i>., gives some indication of Pennyman's life and ideas, as well as revealing an unconventional poetic talent. The most arresting poem, &#145;A Paradox Against Life&#146; (dated 1713) provides a series of bitter philosophical reflections on the pointlessness of desire and hope, in fluent yet robust couplets:<blockquote>
<div>Life, the great Hinge, on which uneasy Man<br>
</div>
<div>Does turn in Pain, and never quiet hang;<br>
</div>
<div>Life, which from worldly Cares contracts each Day<br>
</div>
<div>A Rust which eats our polish'd Joys away,<br>
</div>
<div>Life is a strange and fatal Energy.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Among the more public poems, &#145;A Ballad on the Duke of Marlborough's Funeral&#146; (dated 1722) adopts a similarly tough, sardonic tone in attacking the cruelty and greed of the man; it also implies that Pennyman may have been tory or Jacobite in her political opinions. A group of amorous lyrics, to &#145;Celia&#146; and &#145;Chloe&#146;, are written in the persona of man, but hint at passionate friendships between the women. The pseudonym Celia is used again in the short series of Pennyman's private letters appended to the volume, where she appears as the younger friend of the principal correspondent &#145;Mrs. D. F.&#146; (possibly the &#145;Mary Knight&#146; of the acrostic poem in one of the letters). Pennyman's letters profess extravagant devotion to both &#145;Celia&#146; and Mrs D. F. The friendship between Pennyman and Mrs D. F. cooled after the latter married in 1732 and thereafter Pennyman's letters become increasingly lonely and desperate: &#145;What can I say? What can I do? My Brain is strangely disordered&#146;. Pennyman died soon after this great disappointment, on 16 June 1733, and was buried by her brother Burridge Angier in St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
