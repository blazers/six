<span class="headword">Poyntz,  Charles</span>  (1734/5&#150;1809), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized in July 1735, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22694/', "Stephen Poyntz (bap. 1685, d. 1750)")</script> and his wife, Anna Maria Mordaunt (<i>d</i>. 1771). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39563/', "(Margaret) Georgiana Spencer (1737&#150;1814)")</script> was his sister. The godson of Princess Amelia, as a child Poyntz moved in royal circles; his father was governor to the duke of Cumberland, his mother had been maid of honour to Queen Caroline. With his elder brother, William, he was sent abroad, on Cumberland's bidding, to complete his education after the death of their father. Poyntz matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 13 December 1752, aged seventeen; he graduated BA in 1756, and proceeded MA in 1759 and DD in 1769. Though from a whig family, while at university he entered the circle of high-churchmen such as Samuel Glasse, George Horne, and William Jones, who were slightly older than himself. Their influence left an enduring impress on his churchmanship. Poyntz took holy orders and his friend George Horne wrote for him &#145;A Letter to a Young Gentleman Just Admitted into Holy Orders&#146;, dated 9 October 1759. As a charming and personable young man, the scion of a well-connected family, Poyntz might have expected to go far in his chosen career. As his mother put it in the early 1760s: &#145;If there was a Bishop of Hereford, and the Town could choose him, Charles would be the man, for he is adored here&#146;  (Maclean, 214). But Charles Poyntz was not chosen. His maturity coincided with the demise of Pelhamite power and he was left with patrons unable to help him.<br>
<br>Poyntz lived as a country parson all his adult life. He was named rector of North Creake, Norfolk, in 1760 and remained in post until his death, nearly half a century later. He was conscientious in his duties, for instance trying to hold monthly communion services for the people of North Creake, preaching occasionally in Norwich Cathedral, taking private pupils (such as Lord Duncannon in 1779), planting trees and walks on his glebe lands, and corresponding with friends. Though he was the brother of the first Countess Spencer, Poyntz was never able to obtain much in the patronage stakes beyond prebendal stalls at Llandaff (1769) and at Durham (1784). He preached in Oxford at the invitation of the vice-chancellor (George Horne) in 1780, and there was talk of his name going forward for the deanery of Worcester, which fell vacant while his political allies of the Fox&#150;North coalition held office in 1783, but nothing came of it; had the whigs taken power in 1788&#150;9, during the regency crisis, and had the second Earl Spencer gone to Dublin as lord lieutenant, Poyntz would have been favourite as chaplain. That scheme, too, was a non-starter. A lucrative additional promotion, to alleviate his troubled financial affairs, was his constant hope, but he obtained nothing further except occasional duties as one of the deputy clerks of the closet. He had taken on many of his mother's debts while chronically unable (like other members of his family) to handle money himself. Poyntz was a spendthrift, albeit a charitable one, and he invariably helped friends in financial need, such as George Berkeley, vice-dean of Canterbury. Periodically he took refuge abroad from his creditors. He passed the years 1800&#150;07 on the continent, mainly in G&ouml;ttingen, and died, unmarried, at the London house of his sister, the dowager Lady Spencer, on 10 May 1809. Despite the creation of a family trust his debts by that date were immense and Poyntz was begging his sister for ready money. On his death his executors were confronted with innumerable demands on his estate. He had once written, &#145;I am not that sad man the world suspects me to be&#146;  (Spencer MSS, E. 16), but though his friends knew other sides to him he could not dispel that overriding impression.<br>
