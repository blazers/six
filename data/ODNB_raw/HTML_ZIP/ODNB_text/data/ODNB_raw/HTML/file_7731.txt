<span class="headword">Dod <span class="st"> [Dodd]</span>,  Charles Roger Phipps</span>  (1793&#150;1855), <span class="occ">political journalist and author of reference works</span>, was born on 8 May 1793 in Drumlease, co. Leitrim, the son of the Revd Roger Dod, vicar of Drumlease, and his second wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phipps. Dod's father's family came from Cloverley in Shropshire, his mother's from Spurrtown, co. Leitrim. For most of his life, until 1847, he preferred to spell his name Dodd. On 30 July 1816 he entered King's Inns, Dublin, with the intention of studying law, but he soon gave it up for literature and journalism. Between 1816 and 1818 he was part-owner and editor of a provincial journal. On 24 October 1814 Dod married Jane Eliza Baldwin, the daughter of John Baldwin of Cork; they had one son, <a href="#cosubject_7731">Robert Phipps Dod [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Dod settled in London in 1818 and joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> parliamentary reporting staff. He worked initially for John Tyas, the head of the press gallery staff, whom he eventually succeeded. Horace Twiss and Tyas had established a tradition of providing summaries of parliamentary debates for readers of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, a tradition that Dod continued. His summaries were generally regarded as highly accurate and clear, and soon became more widely read than the complete transcriptions of debates. Dod's other duty at <span class="italic">The Times</span> was writing obituary notices and memoirs. An oft-repeated story was that he was so skilled at this, and so knowledgeable about the lives of public figures, that he was able to write <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary of Lord George Bentinck during a railway trip to London from Ramsgate (where he had been informed of Bentinck's death), without the aid of reference books or notes.<br>
<br>Dod is best known for his own publications, most notably the <span class="italic">Parliamentary Companion</span> and <span class="italic">Dod's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage</span>. The <span class="italic">Parliamentary Companion</span> was founded in 1832 as an annual biographical guide to MPs and peers, and included a short description of parliamentary procedure and other aspects of political life in London. The first edition appeared in 1833. It was originally entitled the <span class="italic">Parliamentary Pocket Companion</span>, and was a small and thin volume, as its name suggests. It immediately became an essential tool for parliamentary journalists and editors, but politicians and the politically active also found it a useful reference book. Dod changed its name to the <span class="italic">Parliamentary Companion</span> in 1841, and the series continued as <span class="italic">Dod's Parliamentary Companion</span>. The <span class="italic">Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage</span> began life in 1841 as a guide to the titled classes, and continued as a competitor to <span class="italic">Debrett's Peerage</span> until 1960 when the peerage information was incorporated into the <span class="italic">Parliamentary Companion</span>. Dod's other publications include <span class="italic">A Manual of Dignities, Privileges and Precedence</span> (1852) and <span class="italic">Electoral Facts from 1832 to 1852 Impartially Stated</span> (1852, 1853). Dod died at 5 Foxley Road, Brixton, London, on 21 February 1855.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_7731"></a><span class="headword">Robert Phipps Dod</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1865), <span class="occ">political editor</span>, was educated at King's College, London. Afterwards he entered the 54th Shropshire regiment and became a captain, a title he held until his death. He worked on the <span class="italic">Parliamentary Companion</span> and <span class="italic">Peerage</span> until his father's death in 1855, when he took over the editorship of both. He also wrote <span class="italic">Birth and Worth, an Enquiry into the Practical Uses of a Pedigree</span>, which was privately published in 1844. On 9 February 1859 he married Catherine Emma Kinchant, the daughter of the Revd John Kinchant. Dod died at his residence, Nant Isa Hall, Selattyn, near Oswestry, Shropshire, on 9 January 1865 from the effects of a shotgun wound to his foot, an accident which occurred while hunting in December 1864.<br>
