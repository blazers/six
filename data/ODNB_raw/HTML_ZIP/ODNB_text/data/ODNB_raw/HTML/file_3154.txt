<span class="headword">Brabazon, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1552), <span class="occ">lord justice of Ireland</span>, was the son of John Brabazon, a gentleman of Eastwell, Leicestershire; his mother's maiden name was Chaworth. At an unknown date he married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Nicholas Clifford of Holme, Kent; they had two sons and two daughters. William was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Cromwell. In April 1534 he was dispatched by the chief secretary to the northern marches of England to prepare for Lord Dacre's arrest. He was appointed under-treasurer, receiver-general, and treasurer-at-war in Ireland on 26 August 1534, holding this position until his death. From 1534 he was a member of the privy council of Ireland.<br>
<br>A virulent opponent of the Kildares, Brabazon was involved in killing 100 of Fitzgerald's galloglass near Naas in March 1535 and campaigned against Fitzgerald in Allen in early August. At that time he withstood the advance of Geraldine forces in co. Kildare, earning the praise of senior members of the Irish council. Later that month he and Lord Deputy Grey negotiated agreements with O'More and O'Connor. In April of the following year he overran MacMurrough's country. Grey departed Dublin in late July 1536 to negotiate with the earl of Desmond and the O'Briens, and left Brabazon in charge of defending Dublin, re-edifying Powerscourt, erecting defences at Fassaroe, and reconstructing the bridge and fortresses at Athy and Woodstock. Brabazon seconded Archbishop Browne's speech in parliament supporting the bill against papal authority and jurisdiction, a stance which is said to have spurred the members of the house to vote in favour of the bill.<br>
<br>The manner of his administration earned Brabazon a stiff reprimand from Henry VIII in February 1537. Before April, Archbishop Browne made allegations of fraud and peculation against Brabazon. In May Brabazon accompanied Grey on a campaign into the lordships of MacGeoghegan and O'Connor. He campaigned against the earl of Desmond and O'Carroll in August. In October 1538 he unsuccessfully tried to negotiate an agreement with MacMurrough. Later that month he accompanied Grey on a raid on Kavanagh's lordship, and they both travelled to Ulster in an effort to expel the Scots. In 1539 he was appointed a commissioner to take surrenders of monastic properties. The following year he went to England to testify at the impeachment of Lord Leonard Grey. In the summer of that year he was accused of misappropriation of the new crown possessions and an audit carried out in 1540&#150;41 unveiled his vast acquisitions and financial malpractice.<br>
<br>On 12 October 1543 Brabazon was appointed lord justice of Ireland, and held office from 10 February to 11 August 1544. In summer 1544 he sent 700 men to serve at the siege of Boulogne. On 16 February 1546 he was again appointed lord justice for a term lasting from 1 April to 16 December 1546. In July he drove O'More and O'Connor from co. Kildare, marched into Offaly, and garrisoned Dangan in Offaly and Ballyadams in Leix (Laois). In mid-December St Leger returned and criticized Brabazon for having goaded both Gaelic lords into rebellion. In 1547 Brabazon became constable of Athlone Castle. In spring 1548 he attended St Leger in suppressing the seditious practices of Viscount Baltinglass's sons in Kildare. In February 1550 he was elected lord justice by the council following the death of Francis Bryan and held office until 10 September 1550. He negotiated an agreement between the earls of Desmond and Thomond at Limerick in March, and campaigned against Charles MacArt Kavanagh in August. On 20 January 1551 he was appointed joint under-treasurer with his son-in-law Andrew Wise. He was nominated a commissioner of the court of wards on four occasions, in 1545, 1547, 1548, and 1550. He died while campaigning in Ulster in July 1552. His heart is said to have been interred with his ancestors in Eastwell and his remains were buried in the chancel of St Catherine's Church, Dublin, where a monument was erected in his memory.<br>
