<span class="headword">Vasey, Sir  Ernest Albert</span>  (1901&#150;1984), <span class="occ">politician in Kenya and businessman</span>, was born on 27 August 1901 in Maryport, Cumberland, the son of Ernest Albert Vasey, an actor. His mother, whose name is unknown, was described as a repertory actress. Vasey's early life was peripatetic. His formal education ended when he left the Bromley national school aged twelve. He followed various trades on his way to achieving a more secure position, working as a Manchester club pageboy, a newspaper vendor, a blacksmith, a cobbler, and a household furnishing salesman, and in the mines. Between 1929 and 1937 Vasey was active in west midlands Conservative politics, earning a reputation as a powerful speaker, and serving on Shrewsbury town council and on the executive committee of the National Conservative Association, as well as being involved with the West Midlands Unionist Association and the Junior Imperial League. On 19 July 1923 he married Norah May (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), daughter of William Percy Mitchell, a master household furnisher. The couple had a son.<br>
<br>A holiday in Kenya in 1935 marked the start of Vasey's long association with the colony, and he settled there in 1937. Resolved never to enter politics again, he followed a business career, eventually serving on the boards of various companies, including the Bata Shoe Company Ltd. In 1938, however, at the suggestion of Gwladys, Lady Delamere, he stood successfully for election to the Nairobi municipal council, remaining a member until 1950. As mayor in 1941&#150;2, he worked for an increase in African representation, securing during his second term in office (1944&#150;6) the addition of two nominated African representatives to the council. In 1944 he married Hannah Strauss (<i>d</i>. 1981); they had one son. In 1945 Vasey was elected legislative councillor for Nairobi North. In this capacity he pressed for greater direction in government policy towards industry, and helped bring about the creation of a ministry of commerce in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1950 Vasey crossed the floor to join the colonial government, becoming only the second European from outside the colonial service to be appointed by the government to the executive council and receiving under the new &#145;member system&#146; the portfolio for health, local government, and education. He later claimed that he had joined the government in order to articulate his &#145;moderate&#146; views more freely and to establish himself as an effective leader of all races  (Vasey to P. Rogers, 20 Dec 1952, Vasey MSS, box 1, file 3). Some, however, thought that the switch of allegiance reflected his failure to attract sufficient support among elected European members in the legislative council to secure his own election  (Blundell, 76). In 1952 Vasey was appointed minister of finance in a bid by the administration to end the political stand-off with European settlers over fiscal policy by promoting an unofficial. He remained in the post until 1959. Vasey was one of the key political figures in Kenya throughout the Mau Mau emergency. He reformed the treasury along more professional lines, and secured the addition of development to his portfolio in 1954 under the Lyttelton constitution. Protecting funds intended for development and attracting additional British financial assistance while ensuring that emergency expenditure did not result in British control over Kenyan finances, Vasey successfully steered the Kenyan economy through the emergency. He helped Kenya to establish strong connections with aid agencies at a relatively early stage, upheld confidence among investors, and urged government encouragement of new industries and the creation of the Nairobi stock exchange, established in 1954, as well as a loans scheme to assist African traders.<br>
<br>Admired by officials as a skilful administrator, Vasey played up his position as an unofficial, threatening resignation on several occasions when it strengthened his hand in negotiations with the Colonial Office and the Kenyan administration. Characterized by British officials in 1949 as &#145;a red hot settler&#146;  (Tignor, 309), Vasey, a member of the Capricorn Africa Society, was progressive politically, financing W. W. W. Awori's newspaper <span class="italic">Radio Posta</span> in the late 1940s, and consistently advocating greater African political advance, calling for instance for the introduction of a common roll. He was the most effective of settler politicians in securing multiracial support, working closely with Asian community leaders, although sometimes privately dismissive of Asian suitability for political office  (ibid.). Vasey formed the Unofficial Members' Organization in 1948 to provide a forum in which members representing all races could meet, and, in 1955, instituted a series of secret meetings with European, Asian, and African community leaders to discuss constitutional advance. In 1959 he was rumoured to be considering forming a multiracial party. Regarded as a man of great integrity, Vasey's robust and opinionated style and his political views left him, however, without significant support among European unofficials, and during his last years at the Treasury criticism of him culminated in demands for an inquiry into Kenya's fiscal policies.<br>
<br>Despite having been a significant influence behind the introduction in 1957 of multiracial representation through an electoral college, Vasey failed to gain election in 1958 to the legislative council as a special elected member owing to an African boycott. He resigned from the council of ministers and in 1959 was invited by Julius Nyerere to Tanganyika, where he was minister of finance and economics from 1959 to 1960 and minister for finance from 1960 to 1962. From 1962 to 1966 he was an economic adviser to the World Bank, and between 1963 and 1966 resident representative in Pakistan for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Returning to Kenya in 1966, Vasey sought a quieter life, working as a financial consultant with, among others, the International Finance Corporation. He chaired several important official inquiries, including an inquiry into local government in Zanzibar (1954). He also published various papers on Kenyan economic and political development.<br>
<br>Vasey's early theatrical associations inspired a lifelong love. He acted from an early age, tried dramatic writing (a one-scene play published in 1933 debated the social costs of industry), and became a partner in a Nairobi playhouse/cinema and managing director in the British East African cinema syndicate, the New Theatre Ltd. He was made CMG in 1945, awarded the insignia of the second class of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar in 1955, and made a freeman of Nairobi in 1957, KBE in 1959, and in 1966 Hilal-i-Quaid-i-Azam of Pakistan. He died in Nairobi on 10 January 1984, predeceased by his second wife.<br>
