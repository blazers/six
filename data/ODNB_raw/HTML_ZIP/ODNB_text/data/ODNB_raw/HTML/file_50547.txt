<span class="headword">Thomas,  Christopher James</span>  (1807&#150;1894), <span class="occ">soap boiler</span>, was born on 16 August 1807 in Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, the eldest of nine children (seven sons and two daughters) of Thomas Thomas (1776&#150;1856), wholesale grocer and butter merchant, and Anne (1785&#150;1842), daughter of Christopher James, grocer of Melingriffith, Glamorgan, and his wife, Mary. Both parents were Welsh.<br>
<br>Thomas's education was disrupted. He attended Taliesin School in Merthyr Tudful, but left at twelve to help run the family business while his father was away, though he returned briefly just before his fourteenth birthday. By 1830 he had moved to Bristol to work in the family soap business at the Red Lion Yard, 7 Redcliffe Street, after his uncle Jones, in one of his &#145;unaccountable fits&#146;  (Somerville, 29) had threatened to discharge the men and close the house.<br>
<br>In 1831 Thomas Thomas bought out John Jones, who was replaced by Christopher. Thomas Thomas retired in 1841 and the firm amalgamated with the soap boilers Fripp &amp; Co. as Thomas, Fripp, and Thomas. In 1856 the four surviving brothers, Christopher, Thomas, Herbert, and Charles, bought out the Fripps and the company was renamed Christr. Thomas &amp; Bros. In February 1844, at Lewins Mead Unitarian Chapel, Christopher married Mary (1813&#150;1893), the daughter of Samuel Lang, a Bristol ironmonger, and his wife, Protheria. After several moves the couple settled at Drayton Lodge, Durdham Park, Bristol. They had six children.<br>
<br>The technical progress of the firm owed much to the brothers' willingness to seek out and adopt new ideas, and they took out several patents: for &#145;Improvements in the manufacture of soap&#146; in 1852, for example, and &#145;the extraction of glycerine from lyes&#146; in 1879. The firm also pioneered the use of silicate of soda to fill soaps, patenting their method in 1855 and 1862. Christopher and Charles travelled widely in Europe and America. A visit to the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence apparently inspired the design of the chimneys of the Broad Plain works, rebuilt in 1882. Like other soap boilers Christr. Thomas &amp; Bros. adopted brand names. In the 1870s they introduced the good quality Sinclair's Cold Water Soap and the cheaper Magic Arizonic Soap which was sold beyond their usual territory by a Mr Harrison, &#145;a thorn in the side of many Northern makers&#146;  (Somerville, 50). Christopher Thomas retired in 1877 on a pension of &pound;600, and in 1881 he transferred his interest in the Broad Plain works to the other partners. The entry in <span class="italic">Kelly's Directory</span> for Bristol in 1894, the year of his death, shows how much the firm had diversified during his life, from just soap boilers to &#145;manufacturers of composite and paraffin candles, silicate of soda, glycerine &amp; refiners of Edible Cotton seed Oil&#146; as well.<br>
<br>From 1845 until 1887 Thomas served as Liberal councillor for the St Philip's ward of Bristol. In 1874 he was elected mayor, the council being influenced in their choice by his &#145;wide reading and cultivated mind&#146;  (Somerville, 26) which the councillors thought made him best suited to preside over the visit to Bristol that year of the British Association. He served on the Bristol city docks committee from 1848 until 1878, and was a member of the Bristol chamber of commerce from 1853 until 1877. He was president of the Anchor Society in 1853 and of the Bristol and Gloucester Archaeological Society in 1878. He was chairman of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway which opened in 1863, and one of its ferries was named after him.<br>
<br>Thomas died on 2 January 1894 in Bristol, less than three months after his wife, Mary. His memorial in Lewins Mead Unitarian Chapel, where he was an active worshipper, is a fitting tribute, recording that &#145;he here bore testimony to the simple truths of the Unitarian belief whereon his heart was ever stayed&#146;. Thomas's only son William died as a child and none of his five daughters was directly involved in the business, though the youngest, Anna Louise, married the brother of one of the directors. However, his brothers' descendants continued the family's involvement in the business until its take-over by W. H. Lever in 1912&#150;13.<br>
