<span class="headword">Borlase,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1682), <span class="occ">historian and physician</span>, was one of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2909/', "Sir John Borlase (c.1576&#150;1648)")</script>, a Cornishman who was appointed master-general of the ordnance in Ireland in 1634 and served as joint lord justice there from 1641 to 1644, and his wife, Alice. By his own account, Edmund Borlase was a member of Trinity College, Dublin, during the provostship of William Chappell (1634&#150;40), but he is not known to have graduated. It is likely that he became a member of the Irish parliament which convened in March 1640: though his return is not recorded, Edmund Borlase was appointed to committees on ten occasions between 27 February 1641 and 9 April 1644. He is said to have been awarded the degree of doctor of physic at Leiden in 1650. He was incorporated as a doctor of medicine of Oxford in August 1660 and set up practice in Chester where Charles Stanley, eighth earl of Derby, was among his patients.<br>
<br>In 1670 Derby was acknowledged in the dedication as the &#145;rise and original&#146; of Borlase's first publication, an account of Latham Spaw in Lancaster, which was situated on Derby's estate. His second book, <span class="italic">The Reduction of Ireland to the Crown of England</span>, which was dedicated to Derby's widow and included an account of the provosts of Trinity, was a &#145;catalogue&#146; of the governors of Ireland from the conquest to 1672 compiled from published works. It contained a brief vindication of the integrity of his father's government and this theme was developed extensively, though impersonally, in his next book, <span class="italic">The history of the execrable Irish rebellion, trac'd from many preceding acts to the grand eruption, the 23 of October, 1641, and thence pursued to the Act of Settlement, 1662</span>. This work, published anonymously after severe cuts had been made by the licenser to the press, Sir Roger L'Estrange, was dated 1680, but it was in print by August 1679.<br>
<br>In December 1679 Robert Clavell, who had published the two earlier works, reported a generally unfavourable reaction to the <span class="italic">History</span>, from the archbishop of Canterbury among others, specifying in particular complaints about &#145;the style and long parentheses of the book, and that in the end you leave people dissatisfyed&#146;: booksellers were already returning unsold copies and Clavell now regretted his investment  (BL, Sloane MS 1008, fol. 239). The earlier part of the <span class="italic">History</span>, though turgid and syntactically odd, is thorough and usefully documented, and benefited both from personal knowledge and from access to the collection of depositions made by Dr Henry Jones in the 1640s. However, Borlase simplified the task of dealing with the later period, of which he seems to have had no direct knowledge. As he acknowledged in his introduction, he had met &#145;with a Manuscript, whence I was supplied with much of the latter part of this History&#146;. Though the evidence suggests that Borlase was unaware of its authorship, this was the work of the earl of Clarendon, published in 1720 as <span class="italic">The History of the Rebellion and Civil War in Ireland</span>. Despite his parliamentarian sympathies, Borlase incorporated it in his text with such telling minor changes as the substitution of &#145;Parliament of England&#146; for &#145;English rebels&#146; and with omissions, since &#145;a part of it was so weaved, as if justice could not have been done to some, without mutchthing of others, which we had reason to wave&#146;. In 1682 John Nalson identified the source, described Borlase as having &#145;very artfully blended it with his own rough and unpolished Heap of Matter&#146;, and denounced him as a &#145;Plagiary&#146;  (Nalson, 2.viii). Borlase had already prepared a second edition, undoing the &#145;very many and large eradications and interpolations of the then corrector of the press&#146;, revising the text, and adding further documents. This remained unpublished and is now in the British Library (Stowe MS 82; quotation from flyleaf).<br>
<br>Borlase had also become involved in the dispute between the earl of Anglesey and the duke of Ormond which had been triggered by the publication of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> of the earl of Castlehaven in 1680 and Anglesey's anonymous reply, <span class="italic">A Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country</span>, a year later. At Anglesey's instigation, Borlase wrote his <span class="italic">Brief Reflections on the Earl of Castlehaven's Memoirs</span>, which was dedicated to the king over the initials E. B. and published posthumously in 1682. Although Borlase had commended Anglesey's <span class="italic">Letter</span>, he was not included in the English council's condemnation of the works of Castlehaven and Anglesey as scandalous libels. Borlase died at Chester on 5 January 1682 and was buried in the church of St John the Baptist in Chester.<br>
