<span class="headword">Leon,  Jack  de</span>  (1902&#150;1956), <span class="occ">theatre manager and impresario</span>, was born on 12 August 1902 at Colon, Panama, the second of eight children of Michael de Leon (1868&#150;1914), merchant, and his wife, May Miriam Maduro (1881&#150;1964). His love of drama developed from when he operated a puppet theatre as a child. In 1911 the family moved to London where he was educated at University College School, Hampstead. After brief forays into the import trade and publishing, he was articled to the legal practice of Indermaur and Brown in London in 1923. On 30 August 1921, at the St John's Wood synagogue, he married <a href="#cosubject_49623">Beatrice Lewisohn [<i>see below</i>]</a>, an actress and founder of a drama school.<br>
<br>In 1924, encouraged by Beatie's mother and with financial help from his elder sister, <a href="#cosubject_52223">Delia [<i>see below</i>]</a>, de Leon leased the Prince's Hall, Kew Bridge, Brentford, Middlesex, which had formerly served as a dance hall, a skating rink, and a cinema. It opened as the Q Theatre on 26 December 1924 with <span class="italic">The Young Person in Pink</span>, a comedy by Gertrude Jennings, and with Milton Rosmer as the production manager. Beatie was in the cast, making her professional d&eacute;but. Although their first production had already achieved success in London's West End, the de Leons' intention was to specialize in wholly new plays in the hope that after a week-long trial at the Q, they would be taken up by West End managers. The policy proved sufficiently successful for the theatre critic James Agate to write: &#145;Clever Mr Jack de Leon that what you think today &hellip; the West End managers often think tomorrow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 25 July 1926, 6). By now de Leon had surrendered his solicitor's articles. His own first play, <span class="italic">The Man at Six</span>, written under the name of Noel Doon and in collaboration with Steve Donohue, was produced at the Q on 16 January 1928.<br>
<br>Criticism of the contractual arrangements with new writers and a series of practical problems led the de Leons to relinquish management of the Q in March 1929. Their association was renewed two years later when Beatie reopened the theatre for a season of plays performed by students from her drama school.<br>
<br>Although he remained closely involved with the Q, de Leon's own future was expanding as a playwright and impresario associated increasingly with productions, including revues, in the West End and on provincial tour, and writing a number of film scripts. He also became an expert in stage lighting; his light cues were included in the publication of his version of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span> which he produced at the Q in April 1948. <span class="italic">The Man at Six</span> was produced at the Queen's Theatre at Easter 1929. For a few months in 1929 he leased the newly built Duchess Theatre. In April 1930 <span class="italic">The Silent Witness</span>, written again by de Leon and Donohue, opened at the Comedy Theatre. De Leon was involved with the production of Noel Scott's <span class="italic">Traffic</span> at the Lyceum Theatre in July 1930 and with <span class="italic">Rocklitz</span> by Marjorie Bowen at the Duke of York's Theatre in February 1931.<br>
<br>Gradually the Q became re-established on a fully professional basis, but now with Beatie in overall charge, and reverted to including in its programme new plays, many of which transferred to the West End. Among these in 1933 was de Leon's most ambitious and untypical play, <span class="italic">Francis Thompson</span>, based on the life of the poet. It was said to have &#145;several scenes which catch at one's throat&#146; but to &#145;emphasise too much the prostitute element&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Stage</span>, 9 March 1933, 12).<br>
<br>In the next twenty years the Q was a training ground for actors, producers, stage managers, and technicians. Among those whose careers began or were nurtured there were Richard Attenborough, Dirk Bogarde, Phyllis Calvert, Joan Collins, Joan Hickson, Vivien Leigh, Margaret Lockwood, James Mason, and Michael Wilding, and the director Peter Brook. Between 1938 and 1940 the de Leons ran the Embassy Theatre, Swiss Cottage, London, alongside the Q. In 1943 and 1944 de Leon put on summer seasons at the Savoy Theatre, Kettering.<br>
<br>De Leon's role as impresario created such West End successes as <span class="italic">See How They Run</span> at the Comedy Theatre in 1945, <span class="italic">The Giaconda Smile</span> at the New Theatre in 1948, <span class="italic">To Dorothy a Son</span> at the Savoy Theatre in 1950, and <span class="italic">And So to Bed</span> at the New Theatre in 1951. His last West End production was <span class="italic">The Count of Clerambard</span> at the Garrick Theatre in 1955. Competition from television and, more immediately, a leaking roof and insufficient financial support from the Arts Council and the local authority, led to the closure of the Q on 19 February 1956. De Leon died from a heart attack on 21 September 1956 at his mother's home, 254 Kew Road, Kew, Surrey, and was cremated at Golders Green on 23 September.<br>
<br>De Leon was tall and elegant with a shock of black, later grey, wavy hair. He always dressed in dark suits or a black jacket, waistcoat, and striped trousers. &#145;He was a barrister manqu&eacute; &hellip; [with] that sort of investigative mind, a natural feel for the dramatic and an arresting voice&#146;  (Barrow, 67).<br>
<br>His wife and co-founder of the Q Theatre, <a name="cosubject_49623"></a><span class="headword">Beatrice Augusta <span class="st"> [Beatie]</span>  de Leon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lewisohn]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1991)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 22 November 1900 at 26 Darnley Road, Hackney, London, the ninth child of Bernhard Lewisohn (1850&#150;1906), boot manufacturer, and his wife, Lydia Moses (1865&#150;1939). As a child she was taught by her widowed mother to recite and was often taken to the local theatre in Dalston and to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London. She was educated in London at Lady Hollis's School, Skinners' School, and Northfield high school. At thirteen she left to learn shorthand and typing and she worked until 1916 in clerical positions before she followed an older brother, Victor, to train at Herbert Beerbohm Tree's Academy of Dramatic Art (later the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art). With Delia de Leon she founded the London Academy of Dramatic Art in 1923.<br>
<br>Beatie de Leon acted occasionally at the Q but suffered from chronic stage fright and was far happier training others or in management. After the closure of the Q and de Leon's death she and the couple's only child, Jean, ran the De Leon Drama School in association with Richmond Adult College for some thirty years. She retired in 1984. Subsequently she became an &#145;angel&#146;, investing in West End shows including the musical <span class="italic">Oliver</span>. She was warm-hearted and had immense courage and drive. Dirk Bogarde compared her to a bright-eyed wren or robin, &#145;eager, alert, determined &hellip; [and] amazingly unsentimental&#146;  (Barrow, xv). She died of cancer on 16 February 1991 at the home she shared with her sister-in-law Delia, King's Lodge, Kew Green, Kew, Surrey, and was cremated at Golders Green on 19 February.<br>
<br>Jack de Leon's sister <a name="cosubject_52223"></a><span class="headword">Delia  de Leon</span>  (1901&#150;1993), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at Colon, Panama, on 10 February 1901. In 1909 she was sent to Jamaica to be educated at a school run by English women. She moved to London with her family in 1911. She had two ambitions: &#145;to be an actress and &hellip; to come to an understanding of God&#146;  (Barrow, 78). She appeared in a number of productions at the Q between 1925 and 1935, initially under the name of Delia Delvina, and was in <span class="italic">The Children of the Moon</span> when it transferred from the Q to the Royalty Theatre, London, in October 1926. She became a disciple of the Indian avatar, Meher Baba (1894&#150;1969), in the 1930s. She was both generous and impractical. Pete Townsend wrote of the &#145;passion, constancy, meticulousness, and enormous anxiety&#146; which combined in an &#145;endearing eccentricity&#146;  (de Leon, xiv). She never married. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">The Ocean of Love</span>, was published in 1991. She died on 21 January 1993 at Abbeyfield, 4 Ennerdale Road, Kew, and was cremated at Mortlake on 31 January.<br>
