<span class="headword">Ball, Sir  (George) Joseph</span>  (1885&#150;1961), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and political administrator</span>, was born at 24 Inkerman Street, Luton, Bedfordshire, on 21 September 1885, the son of George Ball, bookstall clerk, of Salisbury, and his wife, Sarah Ann Headey. He was educated at King's College School, Strand, and at King's College, London. After leaving college he worked as a civilian official in Scotland Yard, and he was called to the bar with first-class honours by Gray's Inn in 1913. He was a keen footballer, and played centre-half for the Casuals until prevented by injury. He was a good shot and an expert fly-fisher. On 16 April 1914 he married Gladys Emily, a school teacher, daughter of John Burch Penhorwood, with whom he had a daughter; after her death in 1918 he married, on 6 October 1919, her half-sister Mary Caroline Penhorwood (<i>d</i>. 1957), with whom he had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War Ball joined MI5, and in 1919 he was appointed OBE. He remained in the service until 1927, when he was persuaded by J. C. C. Davidson, chairman of the Conservative Party, to join the party organization as director of publicity. Major Joseph Ball, as he then was, proved to be a notable asset, along with Sir Patrick Gower, also diverted by Davidson from government employment. Years later, in 1955, Davidson said of Ball:<blockquote>he is undoubtedly tough and has looked after his own interests &hellip; On the other hand he is steeped in the Service tradition, and has had as much experience as anyone I know in the seamy side of life and the handling of crooks. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of a Conservative</span>, 272)</blockquote>One of Ball's successful clandestine efforts was to insert agents in the Labour Party headquarters and in Odham's Press, which did most of the party's printing. In this way he managed to secure both Labour reports of political feeling in the country and also advance &#145;pulls&#146; of their leaflets and pamphlets; it was thus possible for the Conservatives to reply suspiciously instantaneously to their opponents' propaganda. Not surprisingly, Ball was closely involved in assisting Stanley Baldwin to deal with the parliamentary debate in 1928 on the affair of the Zinoviev letter, which had occurred four years earlier. Baldwin was able to emerge triumphantly. It is not known whether Ball played any part in the original episode.<br>
<br>In 1930, in the aftermath of the loss of the general election, Davidson created the Conservative Research Department and made Ball its director, under the chairmanship first (briefly) of Lord Eustace Percy and then of Neville Chamberlain, to whom Ball is said to have taught the art of fly-fishing. Chamberlain respected Ball's knowledge, discretion, and reliability, and later used him in 1938 as an intermediary with Count Grandi, Italian ambassador in London, in order to bypass the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden. Ball was appointed KBE in 1936.<br>
<br>Ball was a very able director. He did much to lay the foundations for the success of the Conservative Party's research department after the Second World War, and recruited for it many young people of high calibre, among others Henry Brooke and Frank Pakenham; the latter, however, later moved to the Labour Party. Ball retired in 1939. From 1940 to 1942, having reverted to his earlier profession as an intelligence officer, he served as deputy chairman of the security executive.<br>
<br>After the end of the war Ball entered the world of business, and became chairman of Henderson's Transvaal Estates and five subsidiary companies, and also of Lake View and Star. He was a director of Consolidated Goldfields of South Africa and of the Beaumont property trust. He was chairman of the Hampshire rivers catchment board (1947&#150;53). He died at St Thomas's Home, Lambeth, London, on 10 July 1961.<br>
<br>Ball moved for most of his life in the shadow of events and was deeply averse to publicity of any sort. He gave very little away, and the formal accounts of his career, whether written by himself or others, are curt and uninformative. He was, however, a quintessential <i>&eacute;minence grise</i>, and his influence on affairs cannot be measured by the brevity of the printed references to him.<br>
