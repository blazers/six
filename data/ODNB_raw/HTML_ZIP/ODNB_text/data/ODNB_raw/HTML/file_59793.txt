<span class="headword">Pearson,  Weetman John Churchill</span>, third Viscount Cowdray  (1910&#150;1995), <span class="occ">businessman and landowner</span>, was born on 27 February 1910 at Midhurst, Sussex, the only son and third of six children of Weetman Harold Miller Pearson, second Viscount Cowdray (1882&#150;1933), Liberal MP for Eye from 1906 to 1918, and his wife, Agnes Beryl (1881&#150;1948), third and youngest daughter of Lord Edward Spencer Churchill (fifth son of George Spencer Churchill, sixth duke of Marlborough). Pearson was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, and became third Viscount Cowdray on his father's death on 5 October 1933. He married, on 19 July 1939, Lady Anne Pamela Bridgeman (<i>b</i>. 1913), third of the four daughters of Orlando Bridgeman, fifth earl of Bradford. There were three children of the marriage, Mary Teresa (<i>b</i>. 1940), Liza Jane (<i>b</i>. 1942), and Michael Orlando Weetman (<i>b</i>. 1944). The marriage ended in divorce in 1950, and on 4 March 1953 Cowdray married Elizabeth Georgiana Mather Mather-Jackson, second of the three daughters of Sir Anthony Henry Mather Mather-Jackson, sixth baronet. There were a further three children by this second marriage, Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1954), Charles Anthony (<i>b</i>. 1956), and Rosanna (<i>b</i>. 1959).<br>
<br>When succeeding to the title in 1933 Cowdray had taken over responsibility for two large estates&#151;at Cowdray Park in west Sussex and Dunecht in Aberdeenshire&#151;as well as a controlling interest in S. Pearson &amp; Son, a diversified business group founded by his grandfather, Weetman Dickinson Pearson, first Viscount Cowdray, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. S. Pearson was run at that time by his uncle, Clive Pearson, and Cowdray devoted much of his time to the management of the estates; he became a considerable authority on farming and forestry. He was also an active sportsman; in addition to the traditional country pursuits of hunting, shooting, and fishing he acquired a great enthusiasm for polo, reaching a handicap of four in 1939. In that year he joined the Sussex yeomanry as a captain. He was badly wounded at Dunkirk and lost his left arm. He made light of his disability and set about working out in practical ways how to minimize the damage&#151;perfecting, with the help of his gunmakers, Purdey, and the Roehampton centre, an artificial arm with a safety release mechanism which would enable him to ride and play polo with great success for many years. For the rest of the war he worked in the Air Ministry, serving as under-secretary of state for air in 1941&#150;2.<br>
<br>After the war Cowdray became increasingly involved in the affairs of S. Pearson, and took over as chairman when his uncle retired in 1954. The company, still wholly owned by the Pearson family, was in a difficult situation at that time. Its main aviation activities had been nationalized, as had its coal mines and electric utilities. It had a controlling interest in Lazards, the merchant bank, and a variety of other financial and industrial investments, including Westminster Press, a chain of provincial newspapers (of which Cowdray's twin sister, Angela, was chairman). Cowdray's achievement over the next twenty-three years was to transform the company, by acquisition, into a broadly based and highly profitable industrial group. Working closely with a group of talented colleagues, of whom Oliver Brian Sanderson Poole, later Baron Poole of Aldgate [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53145/', "Poole, Oliver Brian Sanderson")</script>], was the most important, he looked for well-managed firms which had a strong position in niche markets and which were capable of being developed over the long term. One of his most astute purchases was that of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, bought from the Eyre family in 1957; the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> was then in the early stages of what proved to be a highly successful transition from City news sheet to major international newspaper.<br>
<br>Brendan Bracken, chairman of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> at the time of the takeover, had been greatly impressed by Cowdray's &#145;sound stewardship&#146; of the Pearson business  (Kynaston, 254), and this was an accurate description of his management style. While not afraid to take risks, he eschewed acquisitions which might overstrain Pearson's management resources. He was concerned, above all, with the quality of the businesses he was buying and the calibre of the managers in charge of them. A group that included newspaper and book publishing, Royal Doulton china and Madame Tussaud's, might not fit the fashionable concept of &#145;synergy&#146;, but the formula worked well. When Cowdray retired from the chairmanship in 1977 pre-tax profits were forty times the 1953 level, and gross earnings per share had increased twenty-eight fold. Meanwhile S. Pearson had become a public company; the shares were floated on the stock exchange in 1969.<br>
<br>Cowdray combined his business career with an active life as landowner and sportsman. Polo remained one of his greatest loves, and through his efforts Cowdray Park was central to the revival of the sport which took place in Britain after the war. In 1956 he introduced the Cowdray Park gold cup, which later acquired the additional title of the British open championship. Following in his father's footsteps, he also served the Hurlingham Polo Association, as steward and chairman from 1947 to 1967, and later as president.<br>
<br>Like Pilkington, the glass makers, S. Pearson was one of Britain's last great family business empires, and its durability owed a great deal to Cowdray's personal qualities. An old-fashioned sense of family pride and continuity was linked to a shrewd appreciation of modern management practices. He had a remarkable memory for facts and figures, and knew how to isolate what was important. Unassuming and unpompous in demeanour, he was receptive to new ideas, and listened carefully to all points of view before reaching a decision. When the decision was made, he let others get on with it without interference; if things went wrong, he was always supportive, and ready to work with the managers concerned to put matters right. Above all, he had a rocklike sense of values, and the standards which he set infused all the businesses which he controlled, even those which he rarely visited in person. At a time when family control in large businesses was giving way to professionalization, Cowdray represented an older ethos, but it is one which had a lasting impact on the character of the Pearson group.<br>
<br>Cowdray died at the King Edward VII Hospital, Easebourne, Midhurst, Sussex, on 19 January 1995, following a stroke. He was survived by his second wife and his six children; his son Michael succeeded him as fourth viscount. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, on 7 March 1995.<br>
