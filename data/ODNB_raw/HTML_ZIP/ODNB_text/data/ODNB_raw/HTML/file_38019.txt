<span class="headword">Strangways,  Giles</span>  (1615&#150;1675), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 3 June 1615 in Melbury Sampford, Dorset, and baptized there on 15 June, the second but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39725/', "Sir John Strangways (1584&#150;1666)")</script> and his first wife, Grace (1583&#150;1652), daughter of Sir George Trenchard of Wolveton, Dorset. Of his six brothers and sisters only Howard, the wife of Sir Lewis Dyve, and James, a colonel of foot in the civil war, lived to maturity. His ancestors had established themselves in Dorset in the fifteenth century, and between 1529 and 1713 the parliamentary representation of the county was held by successive members of the family. His father, who sat in nine parliaments for Dorset or Weymouth, was prominent as an opponent of the court in the 1620s and as a royalist in the civil war. Giles was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, 1629&#150;32, and Sir Francis Wortley later wrote of him: &#145;What study e'er he undertakes, to master it he's able&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On returning from travel in France he married Susanna, daughter of Thomas Edwards, a London mercer and marine insurer, with a portion of &pound;10,000. Three of their children died young, but three sons survived to sit in parliament and three daughters to marry into minor gentry families.<br>
<br>Strangways represented Weymouth (with his father) in the Short Parliament (1640) and Bridport in its successor, and as a student of mathematics he was chiefly occupied in counting votes for the nascent royalist party in the Commons. After the outbreak of civil war he left Westminster to raise a cavalry regiment for the king. Taken prisoner with his brother-in-law at the fall of Sherborne Castle (1645) he spent nearly three years in the Tower with Wortley and other leading cavaliers until his father paid the maximum delinquency fine of &pound;10,000. Strangways later presented Charles II with &pound;100 in gold when the fleeing monarch visited Melbury Sampford after military defeat at Worcester. He was also listed by a contemporary among those who acted &#145;very zealously to advance the king's business&#146; in the west  (Smith, 284). His involvement in royalist conspiracy during the interregnum did not exceed the bounds of prudence, however.<br>
<br>From 1661 Strangways sat in the Cavalier Parliament for Dorset, and was in opposition under both the Clarendon administration and, after 1667, the Cabal, in which his local rival, Anthony Ashley Cooper, held high office. But his stalwart churchmanship brought him an honorary DCL from his old university in 1665, when he probably seconded the <span class="roman">Five Mile Bill</span> against dissenting ministers. He succeeded to the Melbury estate with an annual value of at least &pound;5000 in 1666.<br>
<br>Election defeats at the hands of Ashley (now earl of Shaftesbury and lord chancellor) in 1673 put Strangways into &#145;a great rage&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 3.496) and brought him to the fore in parliamentary debates. He attacked with equal vigour the indulgence shown to dissenters and Roman Catholics, the French alliance, and the venality of placemen. Sir William Temple described his principal aims as being to &#145;secure the business of religion [and] break the war with Holland&#146;  (ibid.). After the disruption of the Cabal, he was honoured by the Royal Society with a fellowship (1673) and by admission to Gray's Inn (1674). To him was also ascribed the chief credit for the failure to carry the impeachment of Danby, whose policies at the head of the new administration, both at home and abroad, harmonized with his own.<br>
<br>Strangways possessed real ability as a politician and was a prominent personality in the Commons. On secular matters he was far-sighted in his approval of neutrality between the French and the Dutch, and in proposing re-election as a requirement for members accepting office. Yet Andrew Marvell, who had applauded his single-handed resistance during a debate on the excise in 1666, later described him as &#145;a flagrant Churchman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Letters</span>, 2.320), and rejoiced at his death before he could embark on renewed persecution of dissenters. For after a number of outrageous demands for office Strangways was eventually rewarded with a seat on the privy council, but held it for less than a month before he died of apoplexy on 20 July 1675 at Melbury Sampford, where he was buried.<br>
