<span class="headword">Holyoake,  Austin</span>  (1826&#150;1874), <span class="occ">freethought printer and publisher</span>, was born on 27 October 1826 in Birmingham into an artisan household, the seventh child and fifth son of George Holyoake (1790&#150;1853), a printer, and Catherine Groves (1792&#150;1867), a horn-button maker. Influenced by his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33964/', "George Jacob Holyoake")</script> he became an Owenite, and from 1842 worked as a printer on radical papers in Birmingham and then London. In October 1847 he took charge of the printing of G. J. Holyoake's weekly periodical, <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>, at 54 Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell. Two years later the brothers went into partnership, operating from James Watson's premises at 3 Queen's Head Passage until 1853, when they acquired their own premises at 147 Fleet Street. Here, with Austin responsible for the printing and, from 1858, the publishing, they attempted to give leadership to the freethought movement. In 1862 the venture failed but two years later Austin revived the business, trading as Austin &amp; Co. at 17 Johnson's Court, Fleet Street. He was also active in radicalism during these years, with a reputation for fairmindedness and much in demand as a chairman of meetings. He was a member of the Association for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge and the last printer in England to be prosecuted under the <span class="roman">Newspaper Stamp Act</span>, repealed in 1855. He was also on the recruiting committee for the Garibaldi Legion (1860) and a member of the Reform League (1866). From 1866 until his death he was sub-editor of Bradlaugh's <span class="italic">National Reformer</span> and a vice-president and first treasurer of the National Secular Society, founded in 1866. From the mid-1850s he was a convinced atheist and published over a dozen tracts and lectures, including <span class="italic">Thoughts on Atheism, or, Can Man by Searching Find out God?</span> (1870) and a neo-Malthusean pamphlet, <span class="italic">Large or Small Families? On which Side Lies the Balance of Comfort?</span> (1870). He edited with Charles Watts <span class="italic">The Secularist's Manual of Songs and Ceremonies</span> (1871), to which he contributed secular marriage and burial services. In 1871 he presided over the formation of a republican committee in London, and two years later published his lecture <span class="italic">Would a Republican Form of Government be Suitable to England?</span>
<br>
<br>Austin Holyoake married twice. His first wife, whom he met at the Owenite John Street Institute, was Lucy, daughter of Robert Pettigrew, a tailor. They were married on 5 August 1851, but she died in childbirth on 23 September 1855, aged twenty-seven years. His second wife, Jane, the daughter of James Baker, a coach-maker, was a professional singer, performing as Alice Austin. They were married on 20 November 1858, and had one son, Percy (<i>b</i>. 1861), and one daughter. After Holyoake's death, his widow married Theodore Wright and became a well-known London actress.<br>
<br>Austin Holyoake's importance in radical freethought has been overshadowed by that of his elder brother, George Jacob, but he was an easier personality than the latter and his hard work behind the scenes did much both to launch the secularist movement and to smooth the difficult relations between his brother and Charles Bradlaugh. By 1872 his health was failing and consumption was diagnosed. He died on 10 April 1874 at 17 Johnson's Court, Fleet Street, and was buried a week later in Highgate cemetery, with Charles Watts reading Austin's own burial service over the grave.<br>
