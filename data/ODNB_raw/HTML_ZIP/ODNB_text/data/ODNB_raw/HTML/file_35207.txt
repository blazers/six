<span class="headword">Newall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Phillpotts]</span>, Dame  Bertha Surtees</span>  (1877&#150;1932), <span class="occ">educationist and Scandinavian scholar</span>, was born in Bedford on 25 October 1877, the second of three daughters of James Surtees Phillpotts (1839&#150;1930), headmaster of Bedford grammar school, and his wife, Marian Hadfield Cordery (1843&#150;1925). She was the fifth of six children to survive childhood. She apparently had little formal education, but with the extramural aid of the masters of her father's school she managed to win the gold medal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale des Professeurs de Fran&ccedil;ais en Angleterre in February 1897. Gaining a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge, where she studied between 1898 and 1901, she won a first in French and German in the medieval and modern languages tripos. Cambridge degrees were at that time closed to women so she took an MA degree from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1905 (subsequently becoming DLitt there). In the years before the First World War she worked intensively on developing her knowledge of Scandinavian history and archaeology and increasing her firm grasp of the Scandinavian languages. She showed a particular flair for Icelandic, for which she had the personal tutorage of the eminent Icelandic scholar Eir&iacute;kur Magn&uacute;sson (1833&#150;1913), then under-librarian at the University Library, Cambridge. Phillpotts proceeded to win the Pfeiffer scholarships to Girton in 1903&#150;4 and 1905&#150;6, before becoming librarian of Girton (1906&#150;9) and secretary to Baron Anatole von H&uuml;gel at the museum of archaeology and ethnology at Cambridge (1909&#150;13). In 1913 she was elected the first Lady Carlisle fellow of Somerville College, Oxford. There she made the influential acquaintance of Gilbert Murray.<br>
<br>In 1903 Phillpotts made her first trip to Iceland, spending the summer learning Icelandic in the household of high court judge J&oacute;n Jensson. During a further year of study in Copenhagen she encountered other important Icelandic scholars, including Finnur J&oacute;nsson and Sigf&uacute;s Bl&ouml;ndal. Attracted since childhood to outdoor pursuits such as walking and sailing, she also made visits to Iceland mainly for walking holidays in 1905, 1909, 1910, 1912, and 1914. On these largely unguided trips across the harsh Icelandic landscape she was usually accompanied by female friends from college. Her expeditions, and especially that undertaken in 1909 when she walked a total of about 500 miles around the country, wearing out several pairs of shoes on the way, astounded even the Icelanders  (the Icelandic newspaper, <span class="italic">&Iacute;safold</span>, 28 Aug 1909).<br>
<br>Of all the Europeans involved in Scandinavian studies during this time, Phillpotts probably had the most first-hand knowledge of the countries involved: she was certainly the first woman to enter the male realms of Scandinavian studies on an academic basis, and in 1911 became only the second woman to be elected as fellow to the Society of Northern Antiquities in Copenhagen. She also worked continuously to improve the opportunities and status of other women students. She visited other Nordic countries, spending the war years working as a clerical assistant at the British legation in Stockholm, where she later served as private secretary to the minister, Sir Esme Howard. For this she was appointed OBE in 1918.<br>
<br>On her return to England in 1919 Phillpotts became the principal of Westfield College, London, and was a member of the consultative committee of the Board of Education. In 1922 she succeeded her aunt, Katharine Jex-Blake, as mistress of Girton, a position she held until 1925 (during which time Girton at last received its charter). She then stepped aside to give more time to her ailing father. In 1926, however, she accepted a lecturing position in Scandinavian studies at the University of Cambridge, and subsequently became director of Scandinavian studies and head of other foreign languages. She was the sole female member of the statutory commission for the University of Cambridge (1923&#150;7), and was also a member of the statutory commission for the University of London (1926&#150;8).<br>
<br>Bertha Phillpotts was not a prolific author, but her main works have exerted continuing influence. Her first book, <span class="italic">Kindred and Clan in the Middle Ages and after</span> (1913), concerning the clan society of the medieval Germanic peoples, is still regularly quoted by historical anthropologists, and her final work, <span class="italic">Edda and Saga</span> (1931), has only recently been replaced as one of the best general introductions to early Icelandic literature. Phillpotts's most daring and original work, <span class="italic">The Elder Edda and Ancient Scandinavian Drama</span> (1920), which proposed a dramatic origin for some of the Eddic poems, has been under-rated. By the end of the twentieth century, the inspired and far-sighted arguments expressed in this book at last appeared to be gaining some vindication (see, for example, Terry Gunnell, <span class="italic">The Origins of Drama in Scandinavia</span>, 1995, and Ursula Dronke, <span class="italic">The Poetic Edda</span>, 2, 1997).<br>
<br>Phillpotts was made a DBE in 1929 and two years later married her friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35209/', "Hugh Frank Newall (1857&#150;1944)")</script>, emeritus professor of astrophysics at Cambridge. She died of cancer at their home, Madingley Rise, Madingley Road, Cambridge, on 20 January 1932, and was buried in the Tunbridge Wells cemetery.<br>
