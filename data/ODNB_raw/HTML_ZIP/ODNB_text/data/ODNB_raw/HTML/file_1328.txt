<span class="headword">Barber,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">General Baptist preacher</span>, was a son of William Barber (<i>d</i>. in or before 1611), yeoman of Sherborne, Somerset. In July 1611 he was apprenticed in London's Merchant Taylors' Company and gained his freedom in August 1620. Barber set up trade as a cloth drawer and by 1624 had married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1682) and was living in the London parish of St Benet Fink, where he resided for the remainder of his life. A number of his children were baptized in the parish and by his own account he was a conforming member of the established church for many years. However, in 1637 Barber and his wife were excommunicated from St Benet Fink, having been identified as Baptists.<br>
<br>In June 1639 Barber was summoned before the court of high commission for denying that infant baptism and the payment of tithes were God's ordinance. For this and his refusal to take the <i>ex officio</i> oath he was imprisoned in Newgate for eleven months. In 1641 the first of Barber's nine works was published, a petition, <span class="italic">To the Kings most Excellent Majesty, and the Honourable Court of Parliament</span>. This advanced the central principle of Barber's writing, namely a belief in religious liberty for all individuals on the grounds that only God had authority to judge in matters of faith. This, combined with the doctrine that God had endowed all men with the capacity for salvation, made any form of religious coercion abhorrent. Such views were typical of his sect, but Barber's second tract was far more original in its content. <span class="italic">A Small Treatise of Baptisme or Dipping</span>, published in late 1641, was the first work in England during the seventeenth century that favoured immersion as a form of baptism.<br>
<br>Alongside Thomas Nutt, a fellow General Baptist, Barber published <span class="italic">The Humble Request of Certain Christians</span> in September 1643. The authors called upon Londoners to join them in their petitions to the Westminster assembly and parliament commending Baptist doctrines as the word of God. However, their request generated little response. In Kent in 1644 Barber and Thomas Lambe, the prominent London General Baptist, debated issues of faith with the Particular Baptist leaders William Kiffin and Thomas Patient. This may have been part of a larger evangelical campaign, as in his 1645 tract, <span class="italic">A True Discovery of the Ministery of the Gospell</span>, Barber emphasized the importance of the role of the travelling apostle among the true churches of Christ. The same work attacked the established ministry with its lineage to Rome, arguing that a true minister required the gifts of God, not a university education, to perform his office. For, according to Barber, the minister of Christ was a baptized believer, a member of a true church who worked for a living to ensure that the gospel remained free.<br>
<br>Barber was almost certainly among the leading members of London's early General Baptist meetings and Thomas Edwards reported that in November 1645 he attended a congregation in a large house in Bishopsgate. Edwards's account also described Barber and one unnamed person laying their hands on some eighty people. The practice of laying on of hands on baptized believers at their reception into the church was to prove divisive among the General Baptists and this meeting may have been among the first to adopt the custom.<br>
<br>In August 1648 Barber's <span class="italic">A Declaration and Vindication</span> described how in July of that year a number of the parishioners of St Benet Fink invited him to the parish church to debate with the London minister, Edmund Calamy. After Calamy delivered a morning lecture Barber had attempted to speak but the congregation turned against him and became threatening. Fearing for his life, Barber was escorted home by a constable while Calamy and other ministers looked on.<br>
<br>Barber's tract of June 1649, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Essex Watchmens Watchword</span>, combined an attack on the established clergy and a plea for liberty of conscience with support for the Levellers' <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. He emphasized that the Leveller programme, with its aim of destroying tyrants in both civil and ecclesiastical government, would guarantee not only individual political rights but a complete freedom of worship. Prior to this pamphlet Barber's writings were little concerned with secular matters and he had not been among the General Baptist supporters of the Levellers. But by 1649 dissatisfaction with the presbyterian church settlement and the lack of a true reformation may have led to his endorsement of the <span class="italic">Agreement</span> on the premise that he and the Levellers sought similar freedoms. Two years later, following the Levellers' demise, Barber turned to the officers of the New Model Army with a similar plea. His final work, <span class="italic">The Storming and Totall Routing of Tythes</span> (1651), praised the army grandees for releasing the people from their bondage under the prelates, but demanded a more thorough reformation within the state. He argued that tithes were a remnant of popery and only their abolition would heal the current distractions of the nation. Barber died in 1663 and was buried in the parish of St Benet Fink on 22 June.<br>
