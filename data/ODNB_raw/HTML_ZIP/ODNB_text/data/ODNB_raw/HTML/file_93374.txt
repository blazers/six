<span class="headword">Tajuddin Ahmed</span>  (1925&#150;1975), <span class="occ">prime minister of Bangladesh</span>, was born in 1925 in the village of Dardaria in the <i>upazila</i> (sub-district) of Kapasia in the Gazipur district of Bengal. Little is known of his parents or early life. Often described as &#145;leftist&#146; or &#145;progressive&#146;, he was identified as a member of the &#145;liberal&#146; segment of the Muslim League, the party he joined in 1943. The All-India Muslim League campaigned for a separate state for the Muslim areas of India, a demand that resulted in the partition of India in 1947. While the league was united in its demand for partition, it was not united on the issue of what economic system would be adopted. Tajuddin Ahmed supported the small faction, especially based in what became East Bengal, that proposed a degree of socialism at least in that province. He was a founder of the East Pakistan Juba (youth) League, a radical group. He was also a key leader of the language movement of 1952 that demanded the recognition of Bengali as the language of East Bengal, ending the designation of Urdu as the sole national language of Pakistan.<br>
<br>Support for the Bengali language movement was one of the issues that led Tajuddin Ahmed to the Awami League, founded and led by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. The Awami League in coalition with the Krishak Sramik Party (KSP) routed the Muslim League in the election of 1954 for the provincial assembly. Nevertheless the coalition between the KSP and the Awami League soon failed and the two parties contested for the leadership of East Bengal. Tajuddin Ahmed was one of a number of younger leaders who rose to prominence in the Awami League at this time, the most noted being Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, known as Mujib, who became a minister in the Awami League government. Having graduated from Dacca University with an honours degree in economics the previous year, Tajuddin Ahmed was elected to the provincial assembly in 1954 and was named secretary of cultural affairs and social welfare of the Awami League in 1955. The assembly was dissolved in 1958 when martial law was declared by President Ayub Khan. Tajuddin Ahmed was gaoled for about a year, released, and again arrested in 1964 and 1966, the last time in connection with the Six Points movement, which demanded the transfer of much power from the centre to the provinces.<br>
<br>In the election of 1970 (held under Ayub Khan's successor, Yahya Khan), the only direct election after 1954, the Awami League won an overwhelming victory in East Pakistan (as the province had been renamed), and gained a majority in the Pakistan parliament. The Pakistan military government failed to honour this victory either at the centre or in the province, although negotiations took place. Widespread agitation began in East Pakistan before the election and intensified afterwards. The Pakistan army struck on 25 March 1971, and Mujib was arrested and taken to gaol in West Pakistan. As the conflict spread, several Bangladeshi leaders were able to flee in the last days of March and to form a government in exile. Tajuddin Ahmed was named prime minister of the government in exile and he and his associates organized resistance to the Pakistan army. On 27 March, Major Ziaur (Zia) Rahman had declared Bangladesh an independent state and stated that he was president in the absence of Mujib. Zia subsequently withdrew the statement and recognized Tajuddin as prime minister. In early December, India entered the conflict on the side of the Bangladeshi insurgents. The Pakistani forces surrendered to the Indian forces on 16 December, and Bangladesh became independent.<br>
<br>Tajuddin entered Dacca immediately. He and his associates assumed that the form of government of independent Bangladesh would be a presidential form of government, with Mujib as president. However, when Mujib was released from gaol in Pakistan and returned to Dacca (renamed Dhaka) on 10 January 1972 he stated that the government would take a parliamentary form. Tajuddin Ahmed retired from the prime ministership and was replaced by Mujib. From then until November 1974 Tajuddin Ahmed was minister of finance and planning, serving concurrently at various times as minister of defence, of forests, fisheries, and livestock, of information and broadcasting, and of jute. However, he differed, sometimes sharply, from Mujib on many economic issues. These included matters of the domestic economy, but also those concerning international relationships: Tajuddin leaned toward the patterns of socialist India and the Soviet Union, while Mujib recognized that assistance was much more likely to come from the United States and the western bloc. Tajuddin was dropped from the cabinet in November 1974.<br>
<br>Mujib was assassinated on 15 August 1975 in what is referred to as the &#145;majors' plot&#146; or the &#145;August coup&#146;. Tajuddin was arrested eight days later. He was gaoled along with Sayyid Nasrul Islam, Muhammad Qamaruzzaman, and Muhammad Mansur Ali, who had been members of the cabinet in exile and of Mujib's cabinet. Neither Tajuddin nor the other three were implicated in the plot against Mujib. The four were murdered in gaol in Dhaka on 3 November 1975. The killers were never arrested or tried.<br>
