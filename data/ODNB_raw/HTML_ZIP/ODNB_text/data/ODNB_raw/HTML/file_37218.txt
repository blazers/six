<span class="headword">Brampton, Sir  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [Duarte Brand&atilde;o]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1440&#150;1508), <span class="occ">soldier and merchant</span>, was born in Lisbon <i>c</i>.1440, reputedly the illegitimate son of Rui Barba and the wife of a Jewish blacksmith. About 1468 he travelled to England and converted to Christianity. As was usual in such cases, the king of England stood godfather. Brampton may have fought for Edward IV during the political upheavals of 1469&#150;71. In 1472 he was given joint command of an armed force sent to sea to resist the king's enemies. In October that year he was made denizen and rewarded &#145;for his good service to the king in many battles&#146; with property in London. In the following year he was commissioned to raise mariners for service against the king's enemies.<br>
<br>Brampton may have been the namesake &#145;of the king's household&#146; who entered Lincoln's Inn in 1475, although he can rarely have been in England in the next few years. He came to the attention of Charles, duke of Burgundy, in 1475, presumably as a consequence of the English invasion of France that year, and remained in Burgundy until the duke's death. He was back in Edward IV's service by 1479, when he was a gentleman usher of the chamber. In the following year he received a major grant of land in Northamptonshire formerly held by Isabel Peche, who had died in 1479. In 1481 Brampton served under John Howard, later first duke of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1485), on the naval expedition against the Scots, commanding a Portuguese carvel. By 1482 he had become an esquire of the king's body and was made captain and governor of Guernsey. He remained in the royal household under Richard III, who knighted him and gave him further land in Northamptonshire and London in 1484. In March 1485 he was sent to Portugal to pursue negotiations for a bride for the recently widowed king, and was thus out of England when Richard III was killed at Bosworth.<br>
<br>From the mid-1470s Brampton maintained extensive business interests. He was master of the Drapers' Company of London in 1477&#150;8, and in the latter year appears buying goods abroad for the royal wardrobe. He lent money to both Yorkist kings, repayment generally being made from the customs due on goods shipped by him. He also developed trading interests in Portugal. In return for financial help to Alfonso V he was renaturalized as a Portuguese subject in August 1479 and given trading privileges; in Portugal he was known as Duarte Brand&atilde;o.<br>
<br>After Bosworth, Brampton did not return to the English court. His grants were cancelled by the new regime, and he pursued his career elsewhere, settling initially in Bruges and returning to Portugal in 1487. It was during this period that he came to know Perkin Warbeck (<i>d</i>. 1499), who later claimed to be Edward IV's son, Richard, duke of York. Warbeck's knowledge of the Yorkist court, which impressed contemporaries, may have come partly from Brampton, although there is nothing to associate him with the conspiracy itself. Brampton was finally pardoned by Henry VII in 1489. There is no evidence that he returned to England, though his son was knighted by Henry VII in 1500.<br>
<br>The grant of land made to Brampton in 1480 describes Isabel Peche as his late wife. She was the daughter of William Vaux of Northampton, and the widow of William Tresham (<i>d</i>. 1450). On Tresham's death she married William Peche of Lullingstone, Kent, who outlived her. At her death, Isabel is elsewhere described as Peche's wife, and the nature of her liaison with Brampton is thus uncertain. By 1487 Brampton had remarried; his wife is named variously as Catherine de Bahamonde and Margaret Boemond. His licence to settle in Portugal in 1487 refers to his children, but his only known child is Henrique Brand&atilde;o (<i>d</i>. 1515). Edward Brampton died in Lisbon on 11 November 1508.<br>
