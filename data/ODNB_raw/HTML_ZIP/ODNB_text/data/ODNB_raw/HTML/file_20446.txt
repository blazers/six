<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Conor</span>, third earl of Thomond  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1581), <span class="occ">landowner and rebel</span>, was the eldest son of Donough O'Brien, second earl of Thomond (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1553), and Helen, youngest daughter of Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond. He was the first O'Brien to inherit the earldom since Sir Anthony St Leger, the lord deputy, engineered a compromise in 1543 whereby Donough O'Brien succeeded his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20462/', "Murrough O'Brien, first earl of Thomond")</script>, as second earl. The first earl's title of baron of Inchiquin was vested in his male descendants. Donough O'Brien's stepbrother Donnell O'Brien, however, gained little from the compromise and murdered him in April 1553 following the former's successful bid to have the earldom permanently vested in his male descendants. Conor O'Brien was thus challenged by his uncle Donnell O'Brien who was recognized by many clansmen to have succeeded by the Gaelic custom of tanistry&#151;a development that the 1543 compromise had aimed to avoid. The more experienced Donnell O'Brien, supported by his brothers Tadhg and Donough O'Brien, quickly gained the upper hand among the divided O'Briens. The government, which could not be seen to allow Gaelic custom to overrule English law, interceded on Conor O'Brien's behalf in the summer of 1558, when Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, lord deputy, forcibly installed him as third earl of Thomond. Yet Thomond's position was dangerously reliant on English support.<br>
<br>Tadhg and Donough O'Brien, supported by Gerald Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, assembled a force and defeated Thomond and his ally, Richard Burke, second earl of Clanricarde, at Cnoc Fuarchoilli (Spancel Hill), near Ennis. The attempted coup was thwarted, however, after Sir William Fitzwilliam, lord justice, intervened. This allowed Thomond a brief respite during which he could consolidate his position; but despite earning praise from the government for accompanying Fitzwilliam on an expedition against Shane O'Neill in August 1561 he failed to win unilateral support among the O'Briens. His marriages, moreover, failed to secure any powerful allies. He married first Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1560), daughter of Donald MacCarthy More and widow of James Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond, whose claim to Desmond lands only aggravated relations with the Geraldines. They had no children. He later married &Uacute;na (<i>d</i>. 1589), daughter of Turlough Mac I Brien Arra, with whom he had three sons and three daughters; his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20453/', "Donough O'Brien (d. 1624)")</script>, the young baron of Ibrackan, was raised at court. In 1562 Tadhg and Donnell O'Brien mounted another challenge to Thomond's leadership. They received support from Desmond, while the earl again turned to the government. English ordnance lent to Thomond ensured his survival, but it was clear that the threat posed by his half-uncles had to be addressed.<br>
<br>In September 1564 Thomond and the crown offered Donnell O'Brien a truce on generous terms that amounted to virtual joint rule of Thomond. O'Brien was not satisfied because he was not given recognition or a peerage and resumed hostilities in the spring of 1565. Thomond outfought him with English ordnance.<br>
<br>O'Brien surrendered his claim to the lordship of Thomond in April 1565 settling for possession of Corcomroe. Thomond was still not secure. The government, moreover, had become sceptical of his abilities: visiting Munster in 1566 Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy, noted the utter desolation of Thomond, and in 1567 blamed the earl's &#145;lack of discretion and insufficiency to govern&#146; for co. Limerick's desolation  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/20/66). Thomond became alienated and receptive to overtures from James Fitzmaurice who rebelled in June 1569.<br>
<br>Sir Edmund Fitton was concurrently appointed president of Connaught and set about erecting Thomond into the county of Clare and annexing it to Connaught. This, coupled with his appointment of Tadhg O'Brien as sheriff of co. Clare, pushed Thomond into a desperate attempt to restore his authority. In February 1570 he drove Fitton out of Ennis and arrested Tadhg and Donnell O'Brien, and William Martin, the provost-marshal. He quickly linked his actions to those of Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, and the northern earls, proclaiming &#145;he woulde do nothinge with the lord deputie nor lord president but as the Duke of Norfolk would say&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/30/15). His rebellion was short-lived as his kinsman and former ally <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4209/', "Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond")</script>, was immediately dispatched to bring order to Thomond. He fled to France in June after failing to secure the restoration of his possessions and was subsequently proclaimed a rebel.<br>
<br>In Paris, Thomond became acquainted with Sir Henry Norris, the English ambassador. He hoped that Norris would intercede with Elizabeth I for his pardon. Norris, however, approached the situation with caution, closely watching Thomond's behaviour while keeping the queen fully abreast of his actions. Though Thomond wrote to Elizabeth begging for clemency and claimed that he arrived in France &#145;without ani intention to practise with the French&#146;, it became clear to Norris that he was willing to practise with anyone who suggested intrigue  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/30/72). Norris noted &#145;he is tractable enough and rather apt to follow perilous counsel than to be a deviser therof&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, no. 1110). Elizabeth would not grant his pardon, but realized that he posed a more serious threat while in France and, through Norris, implored him to return to Ireland. He reluctantly departed following promises that his grievances would receive a favourable hearing upon his return.<br>
<br>Thomond returned to Ireland in December and was pardoned by Sidney after publicly confessing his treason. The following April he surrendered his lands to the queen and obtained leave to travel to court to solicit their restoration. He received a warrant for the restoration in June 1573, but was prevented from travelling to court due to his own precarious position in Thomond. In 1572 Thomond hanged three poets in his territory. Though an isolated incident it earned him the enmity of the Gaelic learned classes who vilified him in verse:<blockquote>The earl of the &Iacute; Bhriain, an enemy of the schools, is the most dangerous of monsters; he is a monster whom no man should trust; he is instructed in petty stratagems. (&Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, 132)</blockquote>Thomond's enemies among the O'Briens, moreover, had not melted away and the two factions clashed at Ard na gCabog, in Thomond, in 1573. The fighting continued intermittently until April 1576 when Sidney was once again forced to intervene. Despite the earl's favourable disposition toward the government, the lord deputy had to acknowledge Donnell O'Brien's superior position and ability. He insisted that Thomond surrender his authority to O'Brien who was made sheriff of co. Clare. Spent from years of feuding and in no position to challenge O'Brien militarily, Thomond sought an audience with Elizabeth to press his claims and those of his son. He repaired to England in autumn 1577 and in October a warrant for a new patent was issued upholding the terms of his former patent. His son's succession assured, he remained on good terms with the government despite the introduction of composition during his absence. He died in January 1581 and was buried in the abbey of Ennis, co. Clare. He was succeeded by Ibrackan. In a life marked by contradiction and struggle Thomond failed to exert control over his kinsmen and was uncomfortable with his transition from Gaelic chief to English landlord. Yet his ultimate acceptance of English sovereignty allowed his son, later president of Munster, to acquiesce more fully in English rule. The four masters note that he was:<blockquote>the first man of the descendants of Cormac Cas who had sat in his father's place over that portion of Munster possessed by the descendants of Lughaidh Meann, a junior branch [of his family], who had wrested the government of his principality from the hands of his seniors, according to the laws, regulations, and ordinances of the sovereign of England. (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1580)</blockquote>
