<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morishima,  Michio</span>  (1923&#150;2004), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 18 July 1923 in Osaka, Japan, the son of Kameji Morishima, businessman, and his wife, Tatsuo, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mikawa. Educated in Kobe and Osaka, he made a number of visits in the 1930s to Peking (Beijing), where his father was an airline executive. His university education in economics at Kyoto, at that time one of the largest and most traditional of universities, was interrupted by conscription in 1943 into the Japanese navy where he served as a radio operator and code-breaker. After the war he returned to Kyoto University, graduated in 1946, and then pursued postgraduate studies, latterly becoming a teaching assistant. On 31 March 1954 he married Yoko Tsuda, daughter of Isamu Tsuda, property owner. They had a daughter, Tokiko, and two sons, Akio and Haruo, and Yoko contributed to every aspect of Morishima's career. Appointed assistant professor at Kyoto in 1950, he moved in 1951 to Osaka. Becoming a full professor at Osaka in 1963, Morishima, together with Yasuma Takada, there established the Institute of Social and Economic Research, which was an important vehicle for the modernization of Japanese economics along Anglo-American lines, as was a newly established journal in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, the <span class="italic">International Economic Review</span>, of which he was a joint founding editor.<br>
<br>From the outset of his undergraduate studies in economics, Morishima's intellectual internationalism was evident. He early on discovered John Hick's <span class="italic">Value and Capital</span> (1939), a pathfinding work of general equilibrium analysis. It was a mathematization and theoretical extension of this that formed the subject of his postgraduate research, the fruits of which were published in Japanese in 1950 but not in English until, with other materials, they were published as his <span class="italic">Dynamic Economic Theory</span> (1996). Articles in such leading international journals as <span class="italic">Econometrica</span>, however, began to be published from the early 1950s onwards, and such was his growing reputation that he was able to secure a year at All Souls College, Oxford, with John Hicks in 1956&#150;7 and then again in 1963&#150;4. He became in 1965 the first Japanese president of the Econometric Society. Pursuing what has been seen as a coherent research programme that was established early and developed throughout his career, Morishima was at this time developing a distinctive style of economics that combined fundamental contributions to theory with a commitment, eclectic in its reach, to connect contemporary economics to the discipline's canonical figures, initially Marx and Walras, but later including also Ricardo, Keynes, and von Neumann. The eventual result was a series of monographs, for Morishima was an unusual economist who published books as well as scientific papers: <span class="italic">Marx's Economics: a Dual Theory of Value and Growth</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Walras' Economics: a Pure Theory of Capital and Money</span> (1977), and <span class="italic">Ricardo's Economics: a General Equilibrium Theory of Distribution and Growth</span> (1989), the subtitles of which indicate his central theoretical preoccupations.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the publication of his first English-language book, <span class="italic">Equilibrium, Stability and Growth</span> (1964), combined with his growing frustration with the conservatism of the Japanese economics profession, led Morishima to the next stage of his career: that of emigration to Britain, though he never became a British citizen. He was first appointed to a visiting professorship at Essex in 1968, moving in 1970 to a chair at the London School of Economics (LSE), becoming in 1984 Sir John Hicks professor of economics until his retirement in 1988, upon which he became emeritus professor and in 1991 received the rare distinction of an LSE honorary fellowship. Morishima's LSE years were highly productive, both personally and for his adopted institutional home. A former student, Sir John Morgan, described him as &#145;one of the most extraordinary teachers of mathematical economics of modern times&#146; who, &#145;despite his limited English, with a piece of chalk and a blackboard &hellip; filled the lecture halls &hellip; to overflowing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Aug 2004). Moreover, his textbook <span class="italic">The Economic Theory of Modern Society</span> (1976), developed for his undergraduates, showed that his was a rare mathematical economics that incorporated explicitly sociological and political factors. His commitment to practical, policy-orientated economics found fullest expression and an enduring legacy in the LSE's Suntory Toyota International Centres for Economics and Related Disciplines (STICERD), of which he was the intellectual founder, chief fund-raiser, and first chairman, from 1978.<br>
<br>The move to Britain did not lessen Morishima's engagement with Japanese economics, society, and politics. He wrote prolifically in Japanese on Japan, becoming a public intellectual there as well as, in his English-language publications (most notably his <span class="italic">Has Japan &#145;Succeeded&#146;?</span>, 1982, and <span class="italic">Japan at a Deadlock</span>, 2000), a conduit for greater understanding by foreigners of his home country. Somewhat idiosyncratic, but always elevating and commanding the deep affection of colleagues and students in Britain, Japan, and the USA, his was an academic life well lived. Awarded the Japanese Order of Culture (Bunka Kunsho, often described as the Japanese equivalent of a Nobel prize) in 1976 and made a fellow of the British Academy in 1981, he died on 13 July 2004 at Highwood Hospital, Brentwood, Essex. He was survived by his wife, Yoko, and their three children.<br>
