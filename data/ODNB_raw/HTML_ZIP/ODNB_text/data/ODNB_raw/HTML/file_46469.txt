<span class="headword">Barrington <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lytton]</span>,  Judith</span>, Lady Barrington  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">gentlewoman</span>, was the daughter of the MP Sir Rowland Lytton (<i>d</i>. 1615) of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. Her family had puritan sympathies and was one in which daughters were encouraged to read. In 1612 she married Sir George Smith (<i>d</i>. 1620) of Annables, Harpenden, Hertfordshire; the couple had two sons, Rowland (1614&#150;1639), and George (1619&#150;1634).<br>
<br>Judith's interest in estate management is evident in her careful notes of purchases, rents, leases, details of acreage, farming practice, and tithes. When Sir George died in 1620 leaving debts on a mortgaged property, Judith obtained the wardship of her sons and secured the administration of the estate herself. Within two years she had cleared the debts and proved herself a knowledgeable and competent administrator. As a widow she made an impression in her neighbourhood and was considered a good match. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70626/', "Sir Thomas Barrington (c.1585&#150;1644), MP")</script>, a widower with five children who became her second husband in 1624, remarked that she had turned down other more eminent suitors than himself and that he thought himself very fortunate. He was obviously deeply smitten and wrote several times to his mother praising Judith; admitting &#145;I thinke tis a greate advantage to be a successor to a husband not superlatively good&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2644, fol. 209). The marriage appears to have provided both parties with happiness, although there were no children. Their letters show their mutual commitment to religious reform: both Sir Thomas and Judith supported puritan preachers and Benjamin King dedicated <span class="italic">The Marriage of the Lambe</span> to them in 1640.<br>
<br>After her marriage to Sir Thomas, which took her to Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex, Judith continued with the management of her jointure lands from her former marriage, mainly in Hertfordshire. When Sir Thomas inherited in 1628 the Barrington estates in Lincolnshire, Essex, and the Isle of Wight, she became closely involved in the management of these too. From 1629 her main residence would appear to have been Hatfield Priory. As well as documenting the family's domestic arrangements, extensive notes in her hand surviving for the period 1614 to the 1640s indicate a detailed understanding of different aspects of estate management. She commented knowledgeably on a number of topics including legal matters, forestry, and gardening. She understood, for example, the practical importance of different types of wood to an estate and the management of an effective programme for timber felling; she appreciated the properties of different varieties of fruit trees. She was not just concerned to maximize profits; she displayed a concern for poor tenants unable to pay rents and attempted to mitigate their financial problems. She explained her understanding of the nature of her role in management: &#145;I being the manager of all things and usually what he [the steward] did was by my command, as from my husband&#146;  (Essex RO, D/DBa L35). A closely written memorandum to the steward, John Kendall, in 1632 where she gave extensive instructions and advice confirms her interpretation of this relationship.<br>
<br>Once Sir Thomas became more frequently absent in London with the opening of the Long Parliament and subsequently with his attendance at the Westminster assembly, Lady Barrington sent him news about events in Essex. With the outbreak of civil war she purveyed military as well as other news, on several occasions offering Sir Thomas advice on matters such as selecting an assistant and calling out the trained bands in time to meet the royalist challenge.<br>
<br>On the death of Sir Thomas in 1644, Lady Barrington was left once more to manage her jointure lands. Almost immediately relations deteriorated between Lady Barrington and her stepson Sir John Barrington, who seems to have been determined to be precise about the exact entitlements of his stepmother. The dispute worsened until finally Sir John petitioned parliament, accusing her of denuding the estate of timber to her own advantage and to the long-term detriment of his heirs. Lady Barrington countered the accusations vigorously, refusing to give in to her litigious stepson. The very large number of his lawsuits and the evidence of her former competence lends support to her side of the argument.<br>
<br>Lady Barrington's relations with the rest of the family, moreover, had been and continued to be cordial and based on mutual affection. Judith had been a frequent and lively correspondent with her mother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65888/', "Joan, Lady Barrington")</script>, passing on news and gossip on a wide range of topics both domestic and foreign. She acted as a link in the extended family, placing some members in households, looking after their future, acting as an intermediary with holders of public office, and, for example, writing in 1631 to Viscount Dorchester to seek his help in preventing Sir Thomas's appointment to the unpopular position of sheriff. Later, in her will, codicils distributed bequests of silver and money to affectionately named relatives and servants.<br>
<br>Judith Barrington's extensive papers reveal a depth of knowledge of estate management unusual in the period among women. Her wide-ranging concerns show an understanding of planning for the long-term future of a family, without losing sight of obligations to tenants in difficulties. Her personal letters reveal a woman with real affection for her immediate family and concern for the welfare of the wider family kinship network. Although a few contemporaries and some historians concluded she was bossy and overbearing, the question needs to be raised as to whether this may owe more to her departure from the more acceptable feminine characteristics considered desirable by the contemporary writers, than to a fair analysis of her true character. When she died in 1657 Thomas Goodwin commented in his funeral sermon on her &#145;Affability mixt with much Gravity; Humility with great Eminency; Temperance and Moderation in midst of great abundance&#146;  (Goodwin, 63). She was buried at Knebworth.<br>
