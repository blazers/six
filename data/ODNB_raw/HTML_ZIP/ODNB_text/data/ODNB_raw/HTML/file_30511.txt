<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Azariah, Vedanayagam Samuel</span>  (1874&#150;1945), <span class="occ">bishop of Dornakal</span>, was born on 17 August 1874 in the church rectory of Vellalanvilai, a village located in the Madras presidency of south India. He was the younger of the two children of the Revd Thomas Vedanayagam (1821&#150;1889), Anglican priest, and his second wife, Ellen. He became the first Indian bishop of an Anglican diocese and leader of agrarian depressed class and non-Brahman conversion movements to Christianity.<br>
<br>Azariah received his early education in schools established by the Church Missionary Society in Megnanapuram and Tinnevelly. From 1893 to 1896 he studied mathematics at Madras Christian College, where he was drawn into Christian missionary work through the inspiration of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He led spiritual meetings and evangelistic outreach for the YMCA in Madras during his college years and, in 1896, took a full-time position as a YMCA secretary, first in the Madura and then in the Tinnevelly districts. Azariah worked for the YMCA until 1909, attempting to revive Christian life in rural south India by establishing a grass-roots network of YMCA branches in the towns and villages of his large districts.<br>
<br>Azariah's primary goal during his early career was to recruit Indian missionaries who would devote their lives to carrying the gospel to the unevangelized regions of India and beyond. He gradually extended his universe of activity and influence from his native Tinnevelly (where he established the first major indigenous Indian missionary society in 1903), to greater India (establishing the indigenous National Missionary Society in 1905), to wider Asia (touring Japan and China in 1907), and finally to the West, where Azariah burst upon the international missionary scene in 1910 with an impassioned speech to the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference against Western missionary paternalism toward &#145;native&#146; Christians.<br>
<br>Although his work for the YMCA, the Indian Missionary Society (IMS), and the National Missionary Society (NMS) necessitated much travel during his early career, Azariah was always anchored at home by a strong and secure family life. He married Anbu Mariammal Samuel (1876&#150;1950) on 29 June 1898 in a simple ceremony that, to his delight but to the bride's grandmother's distress, cost less than 40 rupees. During their long and harmonious marriage the couple had four sons and two daughters, in addition to at least one child who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Just as Azariah was gaining international recognition as an effective promoter of Indian missions he received what he interpreted as a divine call to conduct evangelism himself in a specific locality. In 1909 he resigned from the YMCA and the NMS to become superintending missionary for the IMS in Dornakal, located in a small railway depot in the rural Warangal district of south-eastern Hyderabad state. Here, within the favourite hunting grounds of the nizam of Hyderabad, Azariah became a missionary to the Telugu-speaking depressed and non-Brahman classes. He lived first in a tent and travelled through the villages by foot, bullock cart, and bicycle, with his food and <span class="roman">Bible</span> tracts hanging in a bag suspended from his handlebar.<br>
<br>Azariah's self-imposed obscurity in rural Dornakal did not last long. He was soon recruited into Anglican church leadership by Bishop Henry Whitehead of Madras (1853&#150;1947), who persuaded his fellow bishops in India and civil authorities in Madras and London to constitute Dornakal as the centre of a new diocese with Azariah at its head. Azariah was consecrated as the first Indian Anglican bishop on Sunday 29 December 1912 in St Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta; and he remained the first and only Indian bishop of an Anglican diocese until his death.<br>
<br>During an age dominated by secular nationalism Azariah focused his energies mainly on sub-national local evangelism and transnational ecumenism. Azariah led grass-roots conversion movements of roughly 200,000 depressed class and non-Brahman Telugus into the church in his diocese; and he promoted education, temperance, and economic uplift in Andhra's villages. He also became the chief spokesman for non-Roman Catholic Indian Christians in key ecumenical fora: the National Christian Council, the Joint Committee on Union in south India, the Lambeth conferences of 1920 and 1930, the conferences on Faith and Order in Lausanne (1927) and Edinburgh (1937), and the International Missionary Council Conference at Tambaram (1938). Azariah was at least partly responsible for the first unification of episcopal and non-episcopal churches since the Reformation, which took place in south India two years after his death. The University of Cambridge awarded him the honorary degree of LLD in 1920.<br>
<br>As a man of faith in an age captivated by ideology Azariah rarely entered the political fray. One notable exception occurred in 1932, when he joined with Gandhi and other Indian nationalists to oppose the government's expanding policy of granting separate electorates along communal lines. Azariah's brief alliance with Gandhi in opposition to British policy was shattered later in the decade, however, because of a controversy over religious freedom in India. Azariah's advocacy of depressed class conversion movements to Christianity in this new age of mass, communally-based politics threatened Gandhi's bid to secure the allegiance of the untouchables within the political fold of his charismatically Hindu form of messianic nationalism. As a result, Gandhi considered Azariah to be his &#145;enemy number one&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Azariah rose to prominence in an age electrified by political nationalism, but he was neither very political nor very nationalistic. He was certainly influenced by Indian nationalism's desire for independence from Western control and, within the ecclesiastical arena, he helped the church to develop a more secure Indian identity and greater administrative independence from Western organizations. Azariah built both an Indian-style cathedral and an Indian-led clergy for his diocese. But he never advocated radical separation from either the Western church or the British empire. He worked to create an indigenous Indian form of Christianity, but never a Christianized form of Indian nationalism. His close association with Telugu depressed classes in the Dornakal diocese, who generally preferred British rule to the perceived threat of &#145;Hindu rule&#146; or &#145;Brahman rule&#146;, made the bishop wary of Congressite plans for independence. Bishop Azariah's sympathy for Indian nationalism's broadest aspirations was always subdued and moderated by local and transnational concerns.<br>
<br>Azariah died in Dornakal on 1 January 1945 of complications from a malarial fever contracted during a trip to rural areas of his diocese. He was buried the next day at Dornakal Cathedral. His wife survived him. He was known throughout Dornakal as Thandrigaru, a Telugu term meaning &#145;honourable father&#146;, and he is remembered by Indian Christians today for his humble devotion to the needs of often neglected village congregations.<br>
