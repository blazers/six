<span class="headword">Fischer,  Abraham</span>  (1850&#150;1913), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer in the Orange Free State</span>, was born in Green Point, Cape Town, on 9 April 1850, the younger of the two sons of Johannes Jacobus George Fischer (1807&#150;1861), a government official in Cape Town, and his wife, Catharina Anna Margaretha Brink (<i>d</i>. 1873). After the death of his father Fischer and his mother lived in the house of Abraham Denyssen, whose wife was a sister of Fischer's mother. He was educated at the Dutch school, Tot Nut van 't Algemeen, in Cape Town and, from the age of eleven, the South African College School in Newlands, Cape Town, where English was the language of instruction. During his initiation there, his right eye was injured and had to be removed. He nevertheless excelled at school and went on to study law at the South African College.<br>
<br>After completing his legal studies Fischer worked as an attorney's clerk in Cape Town, then as a clerk for Judge C. T. Smith in Grahamstown. In 1872 he started his own practice as an attorney and notary in Kimberley, where a few years earlier diamonds had been discovered. He married on 9 October 1873 Ada Robertson (<i>d</i>. 1927), an English-speaking woman from the Orange Free State (OFS), whose father, Thomas Robertson, a medical doctor, and mother were Scottish immigrants. After his marriage Fischer's home language was English, a circumstance that in due course led to suspicion against him in some Afrikaner circles.<br>
<br>In 1875 the Fischers settled in Bloemfontein, the capital of the OFS Boer republic, where they lived in a house called Fern Lodge. In 1895 they moved to the farm Hillandale, just outside the town. In Bloemfontein Fischer practised as an attorney and advocate in the supreme court, but from 1905 onwards only as an advocate. A successful legal practitioner, he became a friend of his fellow advocates M. T. Steyn (state president of the OFS from 1896 to 1902) and J. B. M. Hertzog (prime minister of the Union of South Africa from 1924 to 1939).<br>
<br>On 9 January 1879 Fischer was elected unopposed as member of the OFS parliament for Philippolis, which he represented until 1882. The demands of his legal practice made it impossible for him to sit in parliament between 1882 and 1886, but he went on to represent Fauresmith (1886&#150;90), Ladybrand (1890&#150;95), and Smithfield (1895&#150;6). He was an independent thinker and did not regard himself as bound by the wishes of the voters in his constituency. When this attitude brought him into conflict with the Smithfield voters he chose to resign as a member of parliament on 7 April 1896 rather than change his views. However, President M. T. Steyn had so high an opinion of Fischer's abilities that he appointed him a member of his executive council (cabinet), in which capacity Fischer served from 29 May 1896 to 10 March 1900.<br>
<br>Fischer played a leading role in the development of the OFS. In 1895 his far-sighted ideal of compulsory education (albeit only for whites) was realized. He also propagated the development of the railways in the OFS (with a view to linking the country with the colonial south and republican north), as well as the expansion of the telegraphic communication network. He favoured closer political and economic ties with the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (the Transvaal) of President S. J. P. Kruger in the republican north. He also encouraged a South African customs union.<br>
<br>In the wake of the failed Jameson raid (December 1895&#150;January 1896) Fischer came to the fore as the most prominent republican mediator between Steyn and Kruger on the one hand and Sir Alfred Milner, governor of Cape Colony and British high commissioner in South Africa, on the other. Fischer distinguished himself as a diplomat and adviser because he was acceptable to all parties: the Boers trusted him because he was outspoken in favour of peace and republican independence, while Milner regarded him as a progressive and as the most influential man in the OFS. Consequently Fischer chaired the Bloemfontein conference (31 May &#150; 5 June 1899), a last-ditch attempt to avert war; but it failed and the South African War broke out on 11 October 1899.<br>
<br>Fischer believed that if one wanted peace, one had to prepare for war. When war became inevitable Fischer wrote the final version of the Boer ultimatum, and spared no effort to ensure that the final preparations for military action went smoothly. During the first few months of the war he visited commandos to boost their morale, discussed tactics, and reported back to Steyn. In March 1900, when the war tide had turned dramatically against the Boers, Fischer was appointed chairman of a deputation that was sent overseas to obtain aid from and intervention by one or more of the great powers. His fellow members of the deputation were A. D. W. Wolmarans (Transvaal) and C. H. Wessels (OFS). They visited Italy, the Netherlands, the United States of America, France, Germany, and Russia. They were received sympathetically in all the countries, but politically did not achieve any positive results. The deputation then settled in the Netherlands, although Fischer spent most of his time in Belgium (in Brussels). Through the press and public addresses in the Netherlands (as well as in other countries) the deputation continued to pursue the Boer cause, and collected money for the victims of the war in South Africa. Fischer was in due course joined in Europe by his wife and two sons.<br>
<br>Although the conflict ended on 31 May 1902, Fischer was regarded by the British as an &#145;irreconcilable&#146; and was only allowed to return to the Orange River Colony (as the British now called the former OFS republic) at the beginning of 1903. There he became the co-founder and first chairman of the Orangia-Unie (1906), a political organization founded in the Orange River Colony to assist Afrikaners in finding their feet again. Fischer campaigned for responsible government and the interests of Afrikaners.<br>
<br>When responsible government was obtained, Fischer became prime minister of the colony in November 1907. He now worked for closer ties between the Afrikaans- and English-speaking inhabitants and for closer unity between the British colonies in South Africa. At the national convention (1908&#150;9) he played an important role in the establishment of the Union of South Africa (31 May 1910), and in Louis Botha's first union cabinet he served as minister of lands and irrigation. From June 1912 he also served as minister of the interior. He was sworn of the privy council in 1913.<br>
<br>By the beginning of 1913 the political strife that had developed in Afrikaner ranks regarding the course they should take to ensure their future as a people had taken its toll on Fischer's health. He suffered from nervous tension, and developed peritonitis and later pneumonia. Physically and emotionally worn down, he died at the Mount Royal Nursing Home, Cape Town, on 16 November 1913. He was buried in Cape Town's Woltemade cemetery on 18 November. Fischer's wife survived him. They had two sons, Harry Fischer (<i>b</i>. 1874) and Percy Ulrich Fischer (1878&#150;1957), who studied law at Cambridge and became judge-president of the supreme court in the OFS. Percy's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63287/', "Abraham (Bram) Fischer (1908&#150;1975)")</script>, also became a prominent advocate, joined the Communist Party of South Africa, defended Nelson Mandela and other accused during the Rivonia trial in 1964, and was himself sentenced to life imprisonment in 1966.<br>
<br>Abraham Fischer is remembered as a sober-minded person, an adroit politician, a capable administrator, an apostle of progress and development, and a great diplomat. A true OFS republican and patriot, he was also a co-founder of a unified South Africa.<br>
