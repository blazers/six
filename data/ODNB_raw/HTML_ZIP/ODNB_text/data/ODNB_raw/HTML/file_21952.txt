<span class="headword">Percy,  Richard  de</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1181, <em>d.</em> 1244), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the second son of Agnes (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1202), heir of the original Percy family, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47211/', "Joscelin de Louvain (d. 1180)")</script>, a younger son of Godefroi, duke of Lower Lorraine, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/165/', "Queen Adeliza")</script>, wife of Henry I. Besides his elder brother Richard de Percy had two brothers and four sisters. He first appears in the pipe rolls in 1181. Some time in or before 1198 Percy's elder brother, Henry, died, leaving a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21961/', "William de Percy (1191x3&#150;1245)")</script>, to whom Joscelin de Louvain's lands passed, but when Agnes de Percy died <i>c</i>.1202, Richard, probably taking advantage of the fact that King John had inherited the kingdom in preference to the son of a dead older brother, was able to claim her lands. He also obtained a small part of the lands of his aunt Matilda, the other heir to the Percy lands, when she died <i>c</i>.1204, although in an apparent compromise between the claims of uncle and nephew the bulk of Matilda's lands went to William de Percy, who in 1214, shortly after he came of age, claimed Richard's lands. This sparked an ongoing legal battle, punctuated by short-lived settlements, that lasted until 1234, when a more permanent settlement was made.<br>
<br>Richard de Percy served frequently on royal expeditions early in John's reign but he was one of the northern barons who began the struggle which ended in the signing of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> by refusing to accompany the king to France in 1214. On 7 May 1215 he and some others made an attempt to treat with the king; one of the twenty-five executors of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, he was excommunicated by Innocent III by name on 26 December [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93691', "Enforcers of Magna Carta")</script>]. In 1216 he and other northern barons reduced Yorkshire to the obedience of the dauphin, Louis of France. On 11 May 1217 Henry III granted Percy's lands to his nephew William, but they were restored by the king on Percy's submission on 2 November.<br>
<br>Percy helped to besiege Ralph de Gaugi in Newark Castle in 1218, and was one of three barons charged with the destruction of Skipton Castle in 1221; he served on campaign with the king in 1224 and 1230. In 1236 he appears among the witnesses of the confirmation of the charters. Percy generally maintained a low political profile in Henry III's reign, but in 1237, when in the parliament the barons prepared to deliberate apart on the king's demands, Gilbert Basset suggested to the king that he should send some of his friends to attend the conference. The words caught the ear of Richard de Percy, and he indignantly cried, &#145;What did you say, friend Gilbert? Are we foreigners then, and not friends of the king?&#146;  (Paris, 3.381&#150;2).<br>
<br>Percy married first Alice, of unknown parentage; on her death he married Agnes de Neville. He had a son, Henry, who must have been illegitimate since Percy's heir was his nephew William. Percy died in 1244, before 18 August. During his lifetime, he made gifts to the priory of St L&ocirc; in Rouen, Sallay Abbey, and Fountains Abbey, to which he gave Litton and Littondale in return for &pound;100 a year for life; if arrangements specified in a grant to Fountains were carried out, he was buried in that house.<br>
