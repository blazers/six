<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clutterbuck,  Robert</span>  (1772&#150;1831), <span class="occ">local historian and landowner</span>, was born and baptized at Watford House, High Street, Watford, in Hertfordshire, on 28 January 1772. He was the eldest surviving son of Thomas Clutterbuck the younger (1744&#150;1791) and Sarah Thurgood (1749&#150;1788), daughter of Robert and Sarah Thurgood, brewers of Baldock, also in Hertfordshire. Clutterbuck was educated at Harrow School and was gentleman commoner of Exeter College, Oxford, from 1791 until 1794, when he graduated BA. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn, London, in 1791, he was described as being a member in 1794. However, he abandoned law for chemistry and painting, taking lessons in the latter from James Barry (1741&#150;1806), and possibly living in London until his marriage, on 10 January 1798, to Marianne (1774&#150;1856), eldest daughter of James Capper (1743&#150;1825), a retired East India Company colonel. Clutterbuck and his wife were living at Cathays, near Cardiff, when their children Robert and Marianne were born, in October 1798 and March 1800 respectively. In 1799 the Thurgood brewery at Baldock, with eleven inns and beerhouses, which Clutterbuck had inherited from his grandfather, was sold for &pound;8842. From July 1801, when another son was born, the Clutterbucks' home was at Watford House, which was set in spacious grounds with a maltings nearby (the family brewery was at Stanmore, Middlesex). Between 1817 and 1830 Clutterbuck travelled in Europe, making many sketches. In 1823&#150;4, as a magistrate and deputy lieutenant, he helped to unravel the mysterious murder of William Weare.<br>
<br>Clutterbuck's claim to fame is his monumental work <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Hertford</span>, published, in three massive volumes, in 1815, 1821, and 1827. Thomas Leman supplied the early history in volume 1 (pp. vi&#150;xvii); three volumes of Thomas Blore's manuscripts, acquired in 1811, proved invaluable. The subtitle of Clutterbuck's history claimed that the text was &#145;compiled from the best printed authorities and original records preserved in public authorities&#146;; it is vast and comprehensive. J. E. Cussans used the text for reference when visiting churches to research for his <span class="italic">History of Hertfordshire</span>, but claimed that Clutterbuck &#145;visited but few of the parishes he describes. &hellip; He trusted entirely to assistants of greater or less accuracy&#146;  (Deacon and Walne, 39). Since much of both histories consists of inscriptions on church memorials this is important. Branch Johnson alleged that &#145;if the most austere in manner Clutterbuck is the most lavish in production&#146;  (p. 9), and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> claimed that &#145;the plates have never been surpassed in similar productions; several were from sketches of his own&#146;. Some were by Thomas Blore's son, Edward. While Clutterbuck produced a monumental record of manors, churches, and the landed gentry before the early nineteenth century, &#145;the short and simple annals of the poor will be looked for in vain&#146;  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Local History</span>, 9). In 1828, however, Clutterbuck published <span class="italic">An Account of the Benefactions to the Parish of Watford</span>.<br>
<br>Robert Clutterbuck died at Watford House on 25 May 1831, following a sudden &#145;inflammation in the stomach before medical aid could be obtained&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 566). He was buried on 1 June in the family vault at Watford House. There is an extraordinary claim by Cussans that Clutterbuck &#145;committed suicide by cutting his throat&#146;, for which there is no supporting evidence  (Deacon and Walne, 39). At his death he owned land in Aldenham, Ashwell, Bushey, and Hinxworth, in addition to the family property at Watford. This was all left to his wife, Marianne, with reversion to his sons. His will mentioned eight shares in the Sun insurance company, &pound;800 in 3 per cent bank annuities, and a debt of &pound;2400 for enclosing Hinxworth. According to one historian of Watford &#145;He stood 6'6", was of imposing presence, looking what he was&#151;a gentleman&#146;  (Jones, 21).<br>
