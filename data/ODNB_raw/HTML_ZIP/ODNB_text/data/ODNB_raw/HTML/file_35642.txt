<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quilter,  Roger Cuthbert</span>  (1877&#150;1953), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 1 November 1877 at 4 Brunswick Square, Hove, Sussex, the fifth of the seven surviving children and the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35643/', "Sir William Cuthbert Quilter (1841&#150;1911)")</script> and his wife, Mary Ann Bevington (1842&#150;1927). His family was extremely wealthy: his father, the first baronet, was a shrewd businessman, and his mother was strong-minded, energetic, and devoted to her family. He grew up in an atmosphere appreciative of the arts, but one which, following Victorian social mores, saw music as a diversion, not an occupation.<br>
<br>Quilter was happy at Pinewood, his preparatory school in Farnborough, Hampshire, where his musical abilities were nurtured; in contrast, his period at Eton College was one of utter misery. A family friend suggested he continue his musical studies abroad, still a common route at that time, and he began at the Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main in 1896. He stayed in Frankfurt for four and a half years, initially studying the piano with Ernst Engesser but later taking composition lessons with Ivan Knorr, who had a remarkable ability to develop individuality in his students. Knorr's pupils also included Balfour Gardiner, Norman O'Neill, Cyril Scott, and Percy Grainger, and the five were together known as the Frankfurt group: though not collectively influential, they nevertheless made significant contributions to the contemporary musical scene. Back in England in 1901, Quilter eventually settled in London, first at 27 Welbeck Street, and then from 1912 at 7 Montagu Street, Portland Square. Two short-term addresses preceded the move in 1938 to his final home, 23 Acacia Road, St John's Wood, and over several decades he held open house to many artists, musicians, and writers. He was well read and well travelled, with an eye for beautiful things, but he was not ostentatious, preferring to use his substantial private means to give young musicians discreet financial support&#151;support which also enabled Jewish friends to flee Vienna in the 1930s: his mother, of Quaker stock, had bequeathed him a warm, humanitarian outlook.<br>
<br>Quilter first achieved public acclaim when Denham Price sang his <span class="italic">Four Songs of the Sea</span> at the Crystal Palace in March 1901. His songs were performed frequently by the major singers of the day: John Coates, Harry Plunket Greene, Ada Crossley, Dame Nellie Melba, and, most especially, the tenor Gervase Elwes, whose great lyrical refinement, integrity, and artistry matched his own. He freely acknowledged Elwes as &#145;the greatest inspiration to me always&#146;  (Quilter to Lady Winefride Elwes, 16 Jan 1921, Lincolnshire County Archives), claiming that he owed &#145;more to G Elwes than anyone, for the popularity of my songs&#146;  (Quilter Papers, priv. coll.). Quilter became a founder member and benefactor of the memorial fund (later the Musicians' Benevolent Fund) set up in Elwes's memory after his tragic death in 1921 at Boston, Massachusetts, and he dedicated many of his songs to him, including the song cycle <span class="italic">To Julia</span>, which they premi&egrave;red together in 1905. In 1923 Quilter met the young baritone Mark Raphael, who took up Elwes's mantle, though never to the same degree; however, the performances in their 1934 recording of seventeen of Quilter's songs are definitive, and he was evidently a fine, sensitive pianist and accompanist.<br>
<br>Quilter loved the theatre: he wrote music for it from 1909 onwards, and his delightful incidental music to the children's play <span class="italic">Where the Rainbow Ends</span>, produced by Charles Hawtrey at the Savoy Theatre, London, in December 1911, proved immensely popular. He collaborated with Rodney Bennett on <span class="italic">The Blue Boar</span>, a light opera broadcast by the BBC in 1933; extensively revised, it was renamed <span class="italic">Julia</span> and performed at Covent Garden in 1936, but, though it received moderately favourable reviews, it was not performed in that version again. However, it produced a glorious waltz song, &#145;Love calls through the summer night&#146;, which stands comparison with the music of Edward German or Eric Coates. His orchestral piece <span class="italic">A Children's Overture</span> (1919), a sparkling and felicitously woven medley of nursery rhymes inspired by Walter Crane's illustrated children's book <span class="italic">The Baby's Opera</span>, was already well known by the time the BBC transmitted it in its first broadcast concert in 1922.<br>
<br>Quilter's tastes in music ranged from Bach to Stravinsky and ragtime, but his sensibilities did not lie with mainstream musical developments, and he was content&#151;notwithstanding his German training&#151;with his own inimitably English sound, untouched by the folk-song revival movement. His songs were broadcast frequently for many years, but despite his fame he remained shy, with a slight stammer. He was more at ease with fellow artists than with those of his own class, unless they too were artistic, and he was relaxed in the non-threatening company of children (though they sometimes found his great height a little daunting): his children's parties at the end of each <span class="italic">Rainbow</span> season were famous.<br>
<br>Quilter's friends were many and very dear to him. He dedicated his choral work <span class="italic">Non nobis, domine</span>, first performed at the pageant of parliament in 1934, to his friend Walter Creighton, who produced it; he also dedicated the first set of Shakespeare songs (1905) and three other Shakespeare songs to him. Other close friends, from before the First World War, were Major Benton Fletcher and the American millionaire philanthropist Robert Allerton, and although he never had a lifelong partner, relationships with them have been presumed. Creighton's cousin Wilfrid Gabriel de Glehn painted the oil portrait of Quilter now held by the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Quilter was never well (he was exempted from service during the First World War on medical grounds) and was a chronic depressive. An operation in 1945 coupled with the shattering news of the execution by a German officer of his favourite nephew, Arnold Vivian, during the Second World War triggered a mental breakdown and he was twice admitted to St Andrew's, Northampton, a private mental hospital. It was alleged after his death that he had been blackmailed for his homosexuality, and while the allegations have never been substantiated they are certainly plausible&#151;a sad coda to his life.<br>
<br>Quilter knew where his strengths lay and never attempted music on a grand scale. He wrote orchestral works, partsongs, some fine piano pieces, and theatre music, much of it in light vein, but he is best-known for his songs&#151;exquisite gems, showing a love of lyricism and language&#151;which mirrored his personal elegance. They are bathed in Edwardian wistfulness, but rise well above the banality of the drawing-room ballad and make a significant contribution to the art-song repertory. Quilter crafted every phrase, every note, and the graceful beauty of the finished product belies the effort that went into its making. Shakespeare and Robert Herrick were his favourite poets among an eclectic selection: three of his most famous songs were settings of Tennyson (&#145;Now sleeps the crimson petal&#146;), Shelley (&#145;Love's Philosophy&#146;) and Edmund Waller (&#145;Go, lovely rose&#146;).<br>
<br>In November 1952 the BBC celebrated Quilter's seventy-fifth birthday with a concert conducted by the chorus-master of the BBC, Leslie Woodgate, Quilter's personal secretary during the 1920s. For the last few weeks of his life he was completely bedridden; he died at his home in St John's Wood on 21 September 1953 of heart failure and pneumonia, and was buried on 25 September in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Bawdsey, Suffolk. A memorial service at St Sepulchre's Church, Holborn Viaduct, was attended by family, musicians, and ordinary members of the public who loved the music of this gentle and gentlemanly composer.<br>
