<span class="headword">Harris,  John Mortimer Green</span>  (1864&#150;1939), <span class="occ">department store manager</span>, was born on 21 March 1864 at 164 Field Street, Everton, Liverpool, the son of David Stephen Harris, draper's assistant, and his wife, Anne Green. He was of Welsh descent. Little is known about his early life, but he worked for a department store in Liverpool until 1908, when he was asked to become a director of Browns of Chester, as manager of the drapery department. Harris married Mary Roberts, and they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1908 the store became a private limited company under the chairmanship of Harry Brown but Harris ran Browns (it was first referred to as &#145;Browns of Chester&#146; in 1913) for over thirty years, and developed it from an old family business into a large modern department store. He successfully promoted Chester, with its black and white timbered medieval houses, as the alternative to the industrial grime of Liverpool and Manchester, and persuaded county people from the Wirral and north Wales to drive into Chester in their motor cars to do their shopping. The store continued to specialize in French fashions (advertisements were often priced in francs), and the first fashion show to be put on outside London was held by Browns in the ballroom of the Grosvenor Hotel, Chester, in 1913.<br>
<br>Expansion continued after the war, and, when the fashion designer Lucy Duff Gordon gave a talk &#145;Dress&#151;what to wear and how&#146; in 1924, she told the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> that Browns was &#145;one of the most up-to-the-minute department stores I have ever been in. &hellip; I've never seen a shop as good as this anywhere in England&#146;  (Willcock, 192). Browns of Chester claimed to be the &#145;Harrods of the North&#146;, and as the mayor of Chester said when opening the new four-storey building in 1926, Browns was Chester, and Chester was Browns.<br>
<br>On the death of Harry Brown in 1936, Harris became chairman, and Harry Brown's son, S. H. Brown, became a director, thus ensuring the continued involvement of members of the Brown family in the business. John Mortimer Harris died on 10 August 1939 at Brookfield Nursing Home, Brookfield Gardens, West Kirby, Hoylake, Cheshire.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_56193"></a><span class="headword">Leonard Mortimer Harris</span>  (1903&#150;1989), <span class="occ">department store manager</span>, also made a career with the firm. Born on 24 August 1903 at The Elders, Grosvenor Road, Hoylake cum West Kirby, Cheshire, he began work as a drapery apprentice with Marshall and Snelgrove in London, and then worked for Harrods before becoming a freelance advertising agent. In 1924 he was invited to take up the temporary post of advertising manager at Browns of Chester, and remained there for the rest of his working life.<br>
<br>L. M. Harris was put in charge of publicity, and it was he who was responsible for making Browns a fashionable place to do one's shopping. The restaurant opened in 1926, and the roof tea garden in 1927, while the &#145;salon de beaut&eacute;&#146; was followed by a palmistry service in 1932. When the new building opened in 1926 there was an exhibition of Roman antiquities discovered during the excavations. Messrs Bees, the seed merchants, held the first of their annual flower shows there in 1926, with talks on flowers and plants by their horticultural experts.<br>
<br>In 1929 Harris was made a director, and, when in 1934 Browns faced a financial crisis as a result of the depression, he became general manager, and took over day-to-day control of the business. On the death of his father in 1939 he was appointed chairman and managing director. In 1943 Harris commissioned the first of several surveys by Mass-Observation Ltd, a public opinion research organization, with the aim of making Browns more appealing to a wider clientele. He later became a director of Mass-Observation Ltd. From 1948 to 1950 he was chairman of both the Drapers' chamber of trade and the Association of Retail Chambers of Trade, and from 1950 to 1951 he was president of the appeal for the Linen and Woollen Drapers' cottage homes, devoting six working days a month to this. Harris was married to the fashion buyer for Browns, Dorothy Freda (1899&#150;1988), daughter of James Parker.<br>
<br>After the war Browns was able to expand again, and in 1950 annual turnover reached &pound;1 million for the first time. In order to compete, the store had to cater for a middle-class market, and in the 1950s the French fashion parades were revived. In October 1950 the Paris collection of Jean Dess&eacute;s was flown over to Browns, the first time a complete Paris collection had been shown in a British store. In 1953 the famous Paris milliner Mlle Andr&eacute;e Fosse spent a week at Browns designing and making hats for customers, and in 1956 and 1960 Pierre Balmain's winter collection was presented. In 1959 Mme Ginette Spanier, directrice of the House of Balmain, described Browns of Chester as one of the best stores in the world.<br>
<br>In December 1960 the firm became part of the Peter Robinson department store, sector of the Montague Burton Group. In consequence Harris retired as chairman but turned to writing again. In the 1930s he had been interested in philosophy and psychology, and published a number of books and pamphlets. In the 1940s he had also begun lecturing widely on retail business efficiency, and from 1957 he developed the idea of unit cost accounting, a new method of pricing. He published <span class="italic">Profit and Personality in Retailing</span> (1961), with Ulric M. Spencer, and <span class="italic">Buyer's Market: How to Prepare for the New Era in Retailing</span> (1963), written with Mass-Observation Ltd. He also published, again with Mass-Observation, <span class="italic">Long to Reign over Us: the Status of the Royal Family in the Sixties</span> (1966). A fellow of the Royal Economic Society, Harris was appointed a JP in 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party, serving on the national executive as well as working for the party in the north-west. He and his wife spent the last years of their lives in Monte Carlo. Harris died on 30 January 1989 at 133 avenue du Petit Juas, Cannes, France.<br>
