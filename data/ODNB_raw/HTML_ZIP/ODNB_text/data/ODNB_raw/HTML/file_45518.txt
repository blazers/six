<span class="headword">Cartwright,  William Cornwallis</span>  (1825&#150;1915), <span class="occ">politician and journalist</span>, was born on 30 November 1825 in Munich, the first of the two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4822/', "Sir Thomas Cartwright (1795&#150;1850)")</script>, a British diplomatist, and his Bavarian wife, Maria Elizabeth Augusta 
    (Lili; 1805&#150;1902)
  , daughter of Cajetan Peter Max, Graf von und zu Sandizell. He had one brother, Thomas (1830&#150;1921). William was educated chiefly by private tutors, and grew up in the cosmopolitan milieu of diplomatic circles, becoming fluent in four languages. His indifferent health meant that studying at Balliol College, Oxford, was rejected in favour of the warmer climates involved in a grand tour. During the 1840s his visits included trips to Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Malta, the Balkans, and Turkey, and in Egypt he made a trip down the Nile. But his favourite place was always Italy, to which he returned again and again. These travels provided the background knowledge for much of his later expertise in foreign affairs, shown in both his journalism and his political career.<br>
<br>In 1847 Cartwright's grandfather died, leaving his father the Aynho estates in Northamptonshire and a large burden of debt. There was insufficient money for William to stand for parliament, as had been planned, so he went back to travelling, and witnessed some of the revolutionary events of 1848 in Europe. This formed his political outlook as a Liberal, and he believed that the extension of the suffrage and education would be a bulwark against the dangers of revolution. He also espoused the cause of Italian unification. In 1850 his life was changed by the early death of his father, then Britain's diplomatic representative in Sweden. William inherited his enormous debts (paid off only in 1881, when he was left money and property by a relative) and, with no profession to follow, he could live as a gentleman only by renting out Aynho and living cheaply abroad. His position in society was weakened further by his marrying his mistress, (Caroline Charlotte) Clementine Gaul (1821&#150;1890), an uneducated Polish&#150;German woman. They had five children, including Fairfax Leighton Cartwright (1857&#150;1928), who was to serve as Britain's ambassador to Vienna in 1908&#150;13. Living mainly in Rome, Cartwright knew most of the city's resident artists and writers; his friends included Frederic Leighton and Robert and Elizabeth Browning. But he was drawn more to Italian politics, especially the &#145;Roman question&#146; (concerning the status of Rome and the Vatican). He was a close friend of Lord Odo Russell, Britain's political agent in Rome (1858&#150;70). Cartwright's contacts among the Roman clergy and political liberals were a conduit of information for Russell, and he became almost an unpaid diplomatic agent himself. In 1866 he met both Gladstone and Clarendon, and accompanied the former during most of his trip to Italy that winter. The two men, from 1868 British prime minister and foreign secretary, sought Cartwright's opinions on Italian matters in subsequent years.<br>
<br>Cartwright began writing for reviews and periodicals in 1858. Some of his articles were eventually turned into his three books: <span class="italic">Papal Conclaves</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Gustave Bergenroth</span> (1870), and <span class="italic">The Jesuits</span> (1876). He also wrote for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, and <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Much of his writing derived from two propositions: that Italian unification was the main issue facing Europe and that the Roman Catholic church contained reformers as well as reactionaries, making reconciliation between Roman Catholicism and liberalism possible. Cartwright's greatest journalistic success was as an occasional correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> during the early part of the First Vatican Council (1869&#150;70). In contrast to the regular correspondents, his column provided the only reliable information in the British press on what was happening during the council's private sessions. He also fed information to Lord Acton (in Rome to help the anti-infallibility bishops), who was behind the famous Quirinus articles in the German press. Cartwright returned to England in February 1870 hoping to persuade the British government to intervene diplomatically to dissuade the council from defining papal infallibility. But his influence on Gladstone was thwarted by Lord Odo Russell's plea for non-interference and Lord Acton's view that only the French government could pressurize the Vatican.<br>
<br>Cartwright had entered parliament as Liberal MP for Oxfordshire in 1868, and his parliamentary life centred on foreign affairs. In 1880 he hoped for a ministerial position, but was overlooked by Gladstone in his need to balance the government between different groupings. Subsequently he parted from Gladstone over Irish policy, quarrelled with his constituency party, and did not stand in 1885. In 1886 he unsuccessfully stood as a Liberal Unionist for Mid-Northamptonshire. He retired to Aynho, but still travelled regularly. He died on 8 November 1915 at Aynho Park, near Brackley, Northamptonshire, and was buried there.<br>
