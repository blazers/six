<span class="headword">Hinchliffe,  John</span>  (1731&#150;1794), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough</span>, was born in Westminster, London, the son of Joseph Hinchliffe, a livery stable-keeper in Swallow Street. Despite his origins Hinchliffe was appointed on the foundation of Westminster School in 1746. One contemporary argued: &#145;[h]is promotion afforded a strong instance of what may be done by merit alone&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 93) and Hinchliffe in a speech in 1779 would pronounce himself &#145;raised &hellip; to a situation in life far above my expectations&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 20.1055). In 1750 he was chosen one of the Westminster scholars to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated as pensioner in 1751. His academic career thereafter revolved around Trinity: scholar in 1751, BA in 1754, fellow in 1755, MA in 1757, and DD in 1764. He took clerical orders as deacon in 1756 and priest in 1757.<br>
<br>Hinchliffe served from 1757 to 1764 as assistant master (usher) at Westminster School. One of his pupils and friends was John Crewe of Crewe Hall, Cheshire. In 1763, while travelling with Crewe, he met the duke of Grafton; most of Hinchliffe's ecclesiastical and political patronage was thereafter tied up with the rise and fall of Grafton and his allies. He married Elizabeth Crewe, sister of John Crewe; they had two sons and three daughters. Hinchliffe was chosen headmaster of Westminster School in 1764. &#145;Our new Master, Dr. Hinchliffe&#146;, wrote one senior, &#145;is, I believe, very good natured: he did not flog anyone the first week, but he has gone on at a good rate since&#146;, though he was apparently careful &#145;never to beat a boy of rank&#146;  (Tanner, 31). Unfortunately Hinchliffe resigned the post only three months later on account of ill health. From 1764 to 1766 he tutored the duke of Devonshire. Through Grafton's patronage Hinchliffe received the valuable living of Greenwich in 1766.<br>
<br>Grafton's administration, although brief, brought a rapid series of promotions to Hinchliffe: he was chaplain-in-ordinary to George III in 1768&#150;9; appointed and installed master of Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1768 to 1788; vice-chancellor of the university in 1768&#150;9. One professor complained of the last-mentioned sinecure: &#145;our Vice-Chancellor, Dr Hinchliffe, is not here and is not expected for some months. To say the truth, we have not had much &hellip; of his company this year&#146;. Although often an absentee from Cambridge, Hinchliffe did play a role in university electoral politics into the 1780s. His disapproval of the 1786 memorial of the &#145;ten junior fellows&#146; led by George Waddington, and their ensuing legal appeal, demonstrated that he was not interested in increasing the academic rigour of the procedure for examining and electing fellows. When at the end of 1769 he was consecrated bishop of Peterborough he resigned the vicarage of Greenwich, though he was able to retain the mastership of Trinity.<br>
<br>Hinchliffe was a fairly vocal and outspoken bishop in the Lords, and his worry in 1776 that he would be seen as &#145;a busy meddler in political matters&#146; was not unfounded. In early 1775 he defended the luxury duty on tea and the related Massachusetts enforcement acts (&#145;a necessity of adopting coercive measures &hellip; condescension would defeat its very purpose&#146;), although wishing for &#145;the middle way&#146; of &#145;reconciliation upon the very easiest terms &hellip; consistently with the just authority&#146;  (Simmons and Thomas, 5.398&#150;400). Yet by the end of 1775 his view was that coercion had already failed to bring about the desired cowing of faction, &#145;reconciliation&#146;, and &#145;lasting re-union with the colonies&#146;. Arguing &#145;we now certainly know that they can and will fight &hellip; if [not for] liberty itself, &hellip; at least [for] the opinion of liberty&#146;, he proposed acceptance of the congressional petition for conciliation  (ibid., 6.80&#150;82). He was a vocal supporter of the duke of Grafton's 1776 motion for conciliatory measures on grounds that coercion had already proven unworkable  (ibid., 482&#150;4). He was one of the few bishops who opposed the Anglo-American War, referring to it in 1778 as an attempt to &#145;establish desolation upon system&#146; by use of &#145;savage fierceness&#146;, and arguing in 1779 that it had led to a general &#145;spirit of dissention, animosity, and resentment&#146; of lower orders in Britain as well as rebelliousness and threats of loss in its possessions  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 20.9&#150;11, 1054&#150;6).<br>
<br>In the debate in 1778 on the <span class="roman">Bill for the Security of the Protestant Religion</span>, Hinchliffe supported Catholic relief on grounds of &#145;reason, justice, and Christian benevolence&#146;, but worried that it might be a time &#145;peculiarly unfavourable for such an experiment&#146;, since any change during the crisis might provoke &#145;the phrenzy of religious zeal&#146;. He also objected that relief did not forbid &#145;Popery&#146; from making converts of protestants through schools or bribery, did not reiterate strongly enough forbidding papists from civil or military power, and did not favour potential protestant heirs to Catholic estates. He maintained until the 1790s his opposition to any form of Catholic relief that might allow Catholic seminary-keepers to convert children of protestant parents. His moderated anti-Catholicism won him the support of the Gordon agitators, who conducted his carriage &#145;with great respect and honour&#146; to the house, although they attacked other politicians  (W. S. Lewis and A. D. Wallace, <span class="italic">Horace Walpole's Correspondence with the Countess of Upper Ossory</span>, 2, 1965, series volume 33.175, n. 8).<br>
<br>The remainder of Hinchliffe's parliamentary career included support for the commutation of tithes for outright grants of lands to clergy in cases of bills of enclosure (1781) and advocacy of excluding crown revenue officers from the right to vote for MPs (1782; Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 22.47&#150;67; 23.99&#150;100). His association with &#145;reforming bills&#146; rather than the high-church clerical interest meant that he was one of only two bishops who attended the first levee of Lord Rockingham's ministry, one of his last brief connections with the &#145;ins&#146; before his final decade of renewed oppositionism. Although Walpole thought that Hinchliffe was one of the two likeliest choices to be the new bishop of Salisbury in June 1782, he was not chosen.<br>
<br>Hinchliffe's political career in university and parliamentary life seemed dedicated to the principle which he had articulated in 1780, &#145;that so long as prejudices and passions form a part of human nature, there is no preserving any government whatever in peace and security without attending to them&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 21.754). His opposition to university reform, his sympathy with the prejudices of the American rebels, and his fears about consequences of a more general Catholic emancipation all pointed to a belief in <i>quieta non movenda</i> that was far more akin to earlier old whiggism than the nineteenth-century &#145;Liberalism&#146; of which he has been seen as a progenitor. By 1788 Hinchliffe had so offended George III that Pitt wrote to the king of a &#145;means of preventing any application for his farther advancement on the Bench&#146;  (Aspinall, 394&#150;5), while at the same time placating Grafton. Pitt's stratagem was to offer the rich deanery of Durham to Hinchliffe on condition of his resigning the mastership of Trinity. Hinchliffe was appointed dean of Durham on 24 September 1788.<br>
<br>Hinchliffe died at his palace in Peterborough on 11 January 1794 of paralysis, after a long illness, and was buried in the cathedral there. He was survived by his wife. His literary career was marked by &#145;very fond&#146; friendship with Horace Walpole, who admired him for his &#145;patriotism&#146;, and who &#145;sent him his Chatterton, and invited him to dine at Strawberry Hill&#146; in 1779. Unfortunately &#145;[n]either side of the HW&#150;Hinchliffe correspondence has been found&#146;  (Cole's MS note at the end of To Cole, 12 April 1779, Lewis and Wallace, <span class="italic">Horace Walpole's Correspondence with the Rev. William Cole</span>, 2, 1937, series volume 2.155&#150;6, n. 1). His 1763 travels had introduced him to Sir Horace Mann and George Montagu. He also attended meetings of the Antiquary Society about 1773.<br>
<br>Hinchliffe was famous in his day as a speaker and preacher, being noted for his &#145;remarkable mellow voice&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 94) and fine delivery. His speeches in the Lords as reported are good specimens of polished oratory. His only pamphlet publications were single sermons. A volume of thirteen collected sermons on apologetic and practical devotional theology was published in 1796. These sermons favoured &#145;the rational belief and steady practice of religion&#146; and refuted &#145;scepticism and infidelity&#146; by giving rationalistic arguments for biblical miracles and religion's value to the &#145;happiness of society&#146;  (Hinchliffe, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 1796). They were thus solidly in the latitudinarian tradition, written &#145;with correctness and simplicity &hellip; to promote virtuous manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, Sept&#150;Dec 1796, second series, 21.71&#150;3). He was also the translator of <span class="italic">A sermon preached by order of her imperial majesty on the tomb of Peter the Great in the cathedral church of St. Petersbourg</span> (1770).<br>
