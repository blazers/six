<span class="headword">Nicols <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Th&eacute;venon]</span>,  Daniel Nicolas</span>  (1833&#150;1897), <span class="occ">restaurateur</span>, was born in either Champlost or Vachy, villages in Burgundy, France. He was apprenticed to a coachbuilder in Sens, moving in the early 1850s to Paris, where he continued to work as a coachbuilder. In 1854, in Paris, he married his first cousin C&eacute;lestine Lacoste (1832&#150;1917), a peasant girl from Vachy: they had one daughter. In the mid-1850s he bought a wine shop from a relative, M. Champroux, and as the business took off he opened two more shops. When Champroux went bankrupt, in 1863, Th&eacute;venon, who had endorsed some of his bills, faced bankruptcy himself for 250,000 francs, and with a warrant out for his arrest he and his wife left France for London in October 1863. In 1864 he was sentenced in his absence to ten years' penal servitude (although he had repaid all his debts by 1871 it was not until 1890 that the supreme court of France cancelled his sentence).<br>
<br>From now on Th&eacute;venon lived under the name of Daniel Nicols, later calling himself &#145;de Nicols&#146;. Lodging in Soho, where there was a large French population, he took on odd jobs while his wife worked as a seamstress, and by 1865 they had saved enough to take over an oilcloth shop at 19 Glasshouse Street, near Piccadilly Circus, turning it into a caf&eacute;, which opened as the Caf&eacute; Restaurant Nicols on 11 February 1865. On 27 April 1865 he was naturalized as a British subject. Later in 1865 he and his wife bought a tailor's shop at 68 Regent Street, behind the caf&eacute;, and after enlarging the premises renamed it the Caf&eacute; Royal in 1867. He continued to acquire neighbouring premises, including a former warehouse at 8 Air Street, around the corner, which he bought in 1867.<br>
<br>After the Franco-Prussian war of 1870&#150;71, many French refugees settled in London, and congregated at the Caf&eacute; Royal, attracted by the French cuisine and the atmosphere of a Parisian caf&eacute;. Its reputation grew after Nicols invited his nephew, Eug&egrave;ne Lacoste (or Delacoste), to stock the wine cellar. Lacoste laid down the finest collection of wine and brandy in England, with eighteen cellars full of large stocks of the rarest vintages, but he spent so recklessly that Nicols was threatened with bankruptcy for a second time. He was able to repay his creditors after the first of the famous Caf&eacute; Royal wine sales, lasting fourteen days and attracting buyers from all over Europe, when one eighth of the stock was sold. As well as offering French food and wine, Nicols evoked the atmosphere of the Paris of the second empire, decorating the restaurants with mirrors, crimson velvet, and gilt. His son-in-law, Georges Pigache, a French lace maker and Bonapartist living in London, designed an emblem for the Caf&eacute; Royal with the French imperial crown and the letter N (for Nicols but also for Napoleon), and this was displayed on all the glass, china, napkins, and menus. As the restaurant became popular with an increasingly elegant clientele, in the 1870s Nicols created a second restaurant, the Grill Room.<br>
<br>In the 1880s Nicols added to the banqueting rooms and enlarged the restaurants when he bought a former hatter's shop at 21 Glasshouse Street, and numbers 6, 12, and 14 Air Street. By the end of the decade, in addition to the statesmen, politicians, and members of the royal family who congregated in the Grill Room or the Restaurant, the Caf&eacute; Royal was beginning to attract a more bohemian clientele, which gravitated to the Domino Room (or Brasserie), with its gilded walls and French decorative art. Calling themselves the &#145;Caf&eacute;-Royalistes&#146;, artists such as Whistler, Augustus John, and Rodin met there, and it became famous in the 1890s when it was frequented by Oscar Wilde. By 1892 it was advertising itself as &#145;the largest, most brilliant, and best known Anglo-French caf&eacute; in the world&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1884 Nicols took over the unsuccessful Pandora Theatre in Leicester Square, renaming it the Empire Theatre. In 1887 it reopened as a music hall seating eight hundred, and like the Alhambra and the London Pavilion it was famous for its promenades and saloon bars at the back of the stalls, frequented by well-to-do young men.<br>
<br>When he had made enough money Nicols built himself a mansion, Regent House in Surbiton, Surrey, set in three hundred acres of land in which he grew peaches and grapes to supply the Caf&eacute; Royal. Extravagantly furnished and decorated in the style of the Caf&eacute; Royal, with gilded panels depicting mythological figures, Regent House was the scene of lavish parties at which guests were entertained in the ballroom by the <i>corps de ballet</i> of the Empire Theatre. A leading member of the French community in London, Nicols belonged to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale, the French club in London, and made large donations to the French Hospital in Leicester Place. He was also a Freemason.<br>
<br>After suffering from diabetes for nine years, Nicols died from gangrene of the foot and blood poisoning on 28 February 1897 at Regent House, and was buried in Brookwood cemetery. He left a considerable estate. His widow, C&eacute;lestine, disputed the will, claiming that under French law she was entitled to half the income and capital. The court found in her favour because the marriage had taken place in France, but her daughter and son-in-law appealed against the verdict, and the case finally went to the House of Lords, which in December 1899 upheld the original decision. After the will had been settled C&eacute;lestine Nicols took over the management of the Caf&eacute; Royal, and revived its fortunes after its decline at the end of the 1890s, running it until her death in 1917 at the age of eighty-five. After the Quadrant was demolished in 1922, it was rebuilt on the same site, and continued to be frequented by writers and artists until the Second World War. The Brasserie closed in 1951, and in 1954 Charles Forte took over the Caf&eacute; Royal, making it the headquarters of his catering empire.<br>
