<span class="headword">Pole,  William  Wellesley- <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em> Wesley-]</span></span>, third earl of Mornington  (1763&#150;1845), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Dangan Castle, co. Meath, on 20 May 1763. He was the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29002/', "Garrett Wesley, first earl of Mornington (1735&#150;1781)")</script>, and his wife, Anne Hill (1742&#150;1831), daughter of the first Viscount Dungannon. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29008/', "Richard Colley Wellesley, Marquess Wellesley")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29001/', "Arthur Wellesley, first duke of Wellington")</script>, were his brothers. After early education at Trim, co. Meath, he went to Eton College but stayed only two years (1774&#150;6), before leaving for a brief stint in the navy. In 1778 he inherited the estates of his cousin William Pole of Ballyfin, Queen's county. It was at this time that he assumed the additional name of Pole. Though his name became Wesley-Pole, and after 1789 Wellesley-Pole, he was always subsequently referred to simply as Pole.<br>
<br>New-found wealth and status allowed Pole to settle into Irish life as an ascendancy country gentleman. From 1783 to 1790 he sat for Trim, the Wesley family seat in the Irish parliament. On 17 May 1784 he married Katherine Elizabeth (1760/61&#150;1851), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9838/', "Admiral John Forbes (1714&#150;1796)")</script>. They had three daughters and a son. In 1790 he tied his fortunes to those of his aggressive elder brother, Richard, the second earl of Mornington and future Marquess Wellesley, whom he joined at Westminster. He sat for East Looe until 1795 and then for Queen's county from 1801 to 1821. While Lord Wellesley was in India as governor-general, Pole represented both his personal and political interests. On 13 May 1802 he seconded Hawkesbury's motion approving the peace of Amiens, and in the following July was named clerk of the ordnance. In succeeding sessions he vigorously defended Wellesley's Indian policy, courting a full investigation of the charges made against him by James Paull and others. He also defended Melville during his impeachment proceedings.<br>
<br>On the return of the tories to power after the death of Fox, Pole resumed his former office, and on 24 June 1807 he became secretary to the Admiralty. In October 1809 he was appointed by Perceval chief secretary for Ireland and was sworn of the privy council, as part of an arrangement to bring Lord Wellesley into the government as foreign secretary. His predecessor in the office had been his own brother Sir Arthur Wellesley. Pole's period of office was marked by renewed agitation for Catholic emancipation. His conservative instincts made him hostile to the measure and its proponents and he recommended their vigorous repression. Pole was by no means alone in his hostility to Catholic rights, as his views were those of the prime minister, Spencer Perceval, and other leading ministers. Pole was, however, intemperate in advocating resistance to Catholic claims and he proved a problem for the government. At the same time, Pole's views were contrary to those of his brother Lord Wellesley. While this did not lead to a split, Pole began to attach himself more closely to his younger brother Arthur, the future duke of Wellington, whose views more closely reflected his own.<br>
<br>In March 1812, following Lord Wellesley's resignation, Perceval proposed Pole's name for admission to the cabinet, but the prince regent peremptorily refused unless Marquess Wellesley were head or part of the government. In the following month Pole is said to have made &#145;a miserable figure&#146; in the debate on Grattan's motion for a committee on the Catholic claims. In May 1812 he became reconciled with Wellesley, and formally acquiesced in the latter's liberal views on the Catholic claims. In deference to his brother, who had lost his duel with Liverpool for the premiership, he resigned the chief secretaryship and the chancellorship of the Irish exchequer in August of that year. He remained out of government until 28 September 1814, when Liverpool appointed him master of the Royal Mint and gave him a seat in his cabinet. In April of the following year Pole went with Lord Harrowby to Brussels to confer with Wellington as to the disposition of the allies and the arrangements for the coming campaign. In the troubled years after Waterloo, he remained an active member of the Liverpool cabinet and he entered into a close personal and working relationship with Wellington.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1821, through Wellington's influence, Pole was created a peer of the United Kingdom with the title of Baron Maryborough. He shared Wellington's disapproval of Lord Wellesley's policy as lord lieutenant in Ireland, but stood alone in the cabinet in opposing a measure for the enforcement of the laws against the secret societies. In August 1823 he resigned the mint and left the cabinet to make room for Canning's associate William Huskisson. He thought himself &#145;shamefully deceived, ill-used, and abandoned&#146;  (Grenville, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of George IV</span>, 2.7), though in a face-saving gesture he was made master of the buckhounds. He never again held cabinet office, though he was postmaster-general in Sir Robert Peel's short ministry of 1834&#150;5, and in 1838 Wellington appointed him captain of Deal Castle. On the death of Marquess Wellesley in 1842 he succeeded to the Irish earldom of Mornington.<br>
<br>Lord Mornington's career was very much a product of his more illustrious brother's influence. Though there are few references to him as a man of talent, it is clear that both Wellesley and Wellington valued his judgement, and therefore so did others. He attended to business conscientiously and, though prone to fits of temper, he was remarkably steady in his politics. Like his brothers, he was an aggressive place-seeker, and fiercely loyal to the interests of the family. He died on 22 February 1845 in Grosvenor Square, London, and was buried in Grosvenor Chapel, Audley Street. Of his three daughters, Mary Charlotte Anne married Sir Charles Bagot; Emily Harriet married Field Marshal Fitzroy James Henry Somerset, first Baron Raglan; and the youngest became <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9140/', "Priscilla Anne Fane")</script>, wife of John Fane, eleventh earl of Westmorland.<br>
<br>Lord Mornington's son <a name="cosubject_29009"></a><span class="headword">William  Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley</span>, fourth earl of Mornington  (1788&#150;1857)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 22 June 1788, probably at Ballyfin, Queen's county, assumed the names of Tylney-Long on his marriage on 14 March 1812 with Catherine, sister and coheir of Sir James Tylney-Long, bt, of Draycot, Wiltshire. She had estates in Essex and Hampshire said to be worth considerably over &pound;1 million a year and had been sought in marriage by the duke of Clarence (later William IV). In 1823 Long-Wellesley eloped with Helena Paterson Bligh, the wife of Captain Thomas Bligh of the Coldstream Guards, abandoning Catherine, who died two years later on 12 September 1825. He subsequently married Helena Bligh (<i>d</i>. 7 April 1869) in 1828. Long-Wellesley, a notorious rake, was generally charged with having run through his first wife's property, but this he was unable to do, having only a life interest. In the years following Catherine's death, Long-Wellesley sought control over his children. He was especially interested in William, the eldest, on whom Catherine's fortune had devolved. His uncle the duke of Wellington intervened on behalf of the children, fighting one of his furious defensive actions to keep the hapless William from his father's clutches. Long-Wellesley was, accordingly, deprived of the custody of his children by the court of chancery, and in July 1831 committed to the Fleet prison by Lord Brougham for contempt of court: Long-Wellesley invoked parliamentary privilege but his plea was rejected by the committee of privileges of the House of Commons. Long-Wellesley sat for St Ives from 1812 to 1818, Wiltshire 1818&#150;20, St Ives again 1830&#150;31, and Essex 1831&#150;2. Out of pique he joined the recalcitrant tories who on 15 November 1830 succeeded in defeating the Wellington ministry. He led a very dissipated life and in his last days he subsisted upon the bounty of his uncle the duke of Wellington, who suffered fools only when they came from the family. He died in lodgings in Mayer Street, Manchester Square, London, on 1 July 1857. The obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> claimed that he was redeemed by no single virtue, adorned by no single grace.<br>
<br>Long-Wellesley's eldest son by his first marriage, William Richard Arthur, fifth earl of Mornington (1813&#150;1863), died unmarried at Paris on 25 July 1863, when the Irish earldom of Mornington passed to the duke of Wellington and the United Kingdom barony of Maryborough became extinct.<br>
