<span class="headword">Thurland, Sir  Edward</span>  (1607&#150;1683), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born at Reigate, Surrey, on 22 February 1607, the eldest son of Edward Thurland (<i>d</i>. in or before 1644) of Reigate and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter and coheir of Richard Ellyott, also of Reigate. Although his family originally came from Nottinghamshire, both his grandfather and father were London merchants. Thurland matriculated as a pensioner from Clare College, Cambridge, at Easter 1624, but then entered the Inner Temple on 20 October 1625, being called to the bar on 15 October 1634. He was elected to the Short Parliament for Reigate on 20 April 1640, but played no discernible part in its affairs or in the ensuing civil wars. Following the decease of his father, in August 1644 he was assessed at &pound;2000 by the committee for the advance of money. By 1647 he had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1676), daughter of Lionel Wright of Buckland, Surrey. They had one son, Edward, who was fifteen in 1663.<br>
<br>During the 1640s and 1650s Thurland appears to have kept a low profile, quietly going about his legal practice. He returned to public affairs in 1659, being returned to parliament for Reigate and accepting local office as a Surrey JP. He was re-elected to the Convention of 1660, and following the Restoration, which saw the duke of York granted the manor of Reigate, he was named on 17 June as solicitor-general to the duke. Thurland was named to several parliamentary committees on ecclesiastical issues, and Lord Wharton felt that he might be friendly towards a church settlement embodying a form of modified episcopacy. In the event Thurland opposed the incorporation of the Worcester House declaration into law. Re-elected to the House of Commons again in 1661, he proved to be a supporter of the court and of the interests of the duke of York. In 1661 he became recorder of the Surrey boroughs of Reigate, Kingston, and Guildford, and was named a commissioner for corporations in that county in 1662. On 14 April 1665 he was appointed a king's counsel, saving for his office of solicitor to the duke, and on 22 April he was knighted. Thurland made strenuous efforts to delay the attack on the earl of Clarendon in 1667, and that same year Andrew Marvell characterized him as a one of &#145;the lawyers mercenary band&#146; of court supporters  (<span class="italic">Poems and Letters</span>, 1.145). On 12 May 1670 Thurland became attorney-general to the duke of York. He was still considered a member of the court party in 1671.<br>
<br>In December 1672, following the furore over the declaration of indulgence, a decision was taken in the committee for foreign affairs of the privy council that Thurland would be made a judge. In January 1673 Thurland became a serjeant-at-law, his sponsors being the dukes of York and Monmouth. On 24 January he was made a baron of the exchequer. Thurland retained his judgeship until 29 April 1679, when it was revoked, officially on the grounds of ill health, but the times were then unpropitious for an adherent of the duke of York. Thurland died on 14 January 1683 and was buried at Reigate. His will exhibited some distrust of his son and heir, Edward, making legacies specifically for the use of his daughter-in-law and her children, but instructing that his chambers be sold to pay his son's debts and that his law books be kept for the use of his grandson, also Edward, who eventually served as MP for Reigate.<br>
