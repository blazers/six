<span class="headword">Shoreditch, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1345), <span class="occ">administrator and diplomat</span>, was of obscure origins. He was styled <i>magister</i> in 1315, presumably of Oxford&#151;two years later an inquiry was ordered into an allegation that he had been abducted and robbed there. By 1321 he occurs as DCL.<br>
<br>Sworn of Edward II's council on 18 October 1321 at the Tower, Shoreditch was appointed keeper of the rolls of king's bench on 11 September 1323, and he also became involved in diplomacy. He departed for France on 28 November 1323 bearing Edward's excuses for his inability to come to Amiens to pay homage to Charles IV (<i>r</i>. 1322&#150;8) for Guyenne. Shoreditch left Paris in January 1324 but in June returned to France with the earl of Pembroke for a further postponement of homage. He was then one of those directed to surrender the castle of Montpezat in Gascony, and on 18 August was appointed a keeper of the castle; but before the letters arrived the French destroyed it. Between 21 August and 29 September he was in the company of Edward's envoy Henri de Sully, but Charles IV, angered by the destruction of the St Sardos bastide in 1323 and by the English king's failure to perform homage, had confiscated Guyenne and refused to give him audience, an intransigence stressed by Edward in a proclamation of 30 September. On 10 September 1325 Shoreditch received protection for accompanying Prince Edward to France for his investment as duke of Guyenne, but he remained consistently loyal to the Despensers, for which he received a pardon in 1327. Nevertheless, in the parliament of November 1330 he sought redress because Queen Isabella had deprived him of Passenham Manor, Northamptonshire, a gift from the king in 1325.<br>
<br>With the new reign Shoreditch acted as an advocate in the court of arches (1328&#150;9), but he soon resumed diplomatic activity, being appointed in September 1329, and again in 1330, to treat with Philippe VI of France (<i>r</i>. 1328&#150;50). In response to Philippe's demand for liege homage he was directed to study the documents concerning Guyenne, and in January 1331 was a member of the embassy that concluded the treaty of Paris (9 March). With Bishop John Stratford he travelled in December 1331 to Bois-de-Vincennes to discuss a wide range of topics, and returned early in the new year.<br>
<br>By 1332 Shoreditch was married to a woman named Helen or Elena, and in February 1333, having renounced his clergy at the king's command, he assumed knighthood with a grant of &pound;40 a year. In 1335 he was granted exemption from serving on juries and assizes for life, on account of loyal service. He was appointed a baron of the exchequer on 10 November 1336 and was deputed to deal with petitions of Gascony, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland in the 1340 parliament. But after Stratford's dismissal in 1341 he was deprived until April 1345 of his keepership of the rolls of king's bench.<br>
<br>From 1332 Shoreditch was frequently abroad. In 1334 he was a member of an embassy to France led by Archbishop Stratford to deal with matters concerning France, Gascony, Ponthieu, and Brittany, and in 1335&#150;6 was engaged in negotiating a prospective marriage between Edward III's infant daughter, Joan of the Tower (<i>d</i>. 1362), and Friedrich, son of the duke of Austria, and in seeking alliances with the archbishop of Cologne, the duke of Brabant, and others. As a diplomat he could be aggressive. Baker records (in a narrative misplaced under 1339) that Philippe idiosyncratically complained, not that Edward had adopted his arms, but that in quartering his own with those of France he had placed the leopards of the little island of England in the first quarter. To this Shoreditch responded that the king had adopted current practice (<i>usitato more modernorum</i>) in placing <i>his</i> progenitors' arms before those acquired <i>iure materno</i> and thus styled himself king of England and France&#151;in that order. Murimuth recounts his belligerence at the papal curia in 1343, when he expressed the opinions of parliament and king on papal provision, and branded the would-be dean of York, Cardinal Talleyrand, &#145;the enemy of both king and kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Adae Murimuth continuatio chronicarum</span>, 230). In December of that year, and again in 1344 he was appointed envoy to Alfonso XI, king of Castile (<i>r</i>. 1312&#150;50).<br>
<br>In the 1330s Shoreditch assisted the Westminster monks in the appropriation of Longdon church, Worcestershire, and was granted a mortmain licence in 1338 to found a chantry of three chaplains in the abbey; in the event, a chantry for two monk-chaplains was established at St Benedict's altar. Shoreditch was murdered on 10 July 1345 in his house at Ware, Hertfordshire, by four of his servants, who were subsequently hanged.<br>
