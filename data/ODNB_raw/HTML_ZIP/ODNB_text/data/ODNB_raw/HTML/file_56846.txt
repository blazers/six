<span class="headword">Goldney,  Thomas</span>  (1696&#150;1768), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was born on 12 July 1696 at Clifton, near Bristol, the sixth of the twelve children of Thomas Goldney (1664&#150;1731) and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Speed (<i>c</i>.1667&#150;1722). His father was a grocer who supplemented his income by holding shares in ships and by acting as agent for the collector of customs for the port of Bristol. After being educated in a Quaker household at Painswick, Gloucestershire, and at a school run by the Society of Friends in Bristol, Thomas was apprenticed to his parents in 1711. In 1717 he began work with the Coalbrookdale Company in Shropshire, the leading ironworks in the country, acting on behalf of his father, who had mortgaged half these ironworks a few years earlier. He remained for six years at Coalbrookdale, where he served as clerk and collected money and orders. In 1723 he returned to Bristol and joined his father and his younger brother Gabriel in trade there, though he spent much time dealing with consignments of goods from Coalbrookdale. In 1726 he was admitted to the freedom of Bristol. He became the head of his family after the death of his father in 1731.<br>
<br>Goldney devoted much of his business career to dealing with the family's interests in ironworks. In 1731 he became the Bristol agent for the Coalbrookdale Company, and took a particular interest in consignments of pig iron, the casting of hollow ware, engine parts, and the manufacture of guns. He installed Richard Reynolds as manager at Coalbrookdale in 1763, but continued working as an adviser to the firm in Bristol until his death. Goldney was a shareholder in the Willey ironworks, across the River Severn from Coalbrookdale, from 1733 to 1758. In the 1730s he was jointly concerned with Richard Ford in Bershay furnace, near Wrexham. Between 1754 and 1757 he became a co-partner with Abraham Darby (1711&#150;1763) in furnaces at Horsehay farm 2 miles north of Coalbrookdale, and held a one-third share in the Ketley furnaces, 2 miles north of Horsehay.<br>
<br>In the 1740s Goldney diversified his industrial interests. He held shares in the Warmley Brass Company, near Bristol, and the Bristol Lead Company. He was involved with the Champion family in various enterprises in Flintshire, including coal and lead mines, a smeltery, and a calamine works. He bought shares in ships and in mines in Devon, Cornwall, and Ireland. In 1752 he also became a partner in one of Bristol's first banks under the name of Goldney, Smith &amp; Co., and held a one-sixth share (<i>c</i>.&pound;2000) of the bank's initial capital.<br>
<br>Apart from his business career, Goldney had interests in land and property. He inherited Elberton mansion house and farm, some 8 miles north of Bristol, a house and property in Chester, a Bristol town house in Castle Green, and a half share of the Clifton house, grounds, and household goods that had been purchased by his father in 1705. Goldney devoted much attention to the management and development of this property. He purchased land to gain additional income but was concerned mainly with improving his garden as a gentleman's seat. He landscaped the garden with a grotto, terrace, rotunda, tower, octagon, orangery, and paddock, and placed classical figures around the grounds. The grotto was especially admired because it was connected to a subterranean passage adorned with minerals, fossils, fine shells, and Bristol diamonds (or rock crystals). There was also a cascade of water with a seated figure of Neptune at its head. Goldney's estate was broken up in the mid-nineteenth century. The University of Bristol acquired Goldney House, as it is now known, and restored the grotto to some of its former glory.<br>
<br>Goldney does not seem to have been very active in the Society of Friends. When he became a Bristol burgess he made a solemn declaration instead of taking the oath, as did other Quakers. He voted for the whigs but does not seem to have been politically active. He died unmarried at Clifton on 28 December 1768 and was buried on 2 January 1769 at the Quaker burial-ground, Redcliffe, Bristol. His inventory shows that he owned more than 300 books, and had comfortable furnishings including mahogany and walnut furniture and satin curtains, demonstrating a standard of living more luxurious than in most Quaker households. A balance sheet of his personal estate as it stood on the day of his death, drawn up for his executors, reveals that he had total credits amounting to about &pound;33,000 and debits totalling &pound;12,000.<br>
