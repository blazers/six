<span class="headword">Cochrane,  Archibald</span>, ninth earl of Dundonald  (1748&#150;1831), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 1 January 1748, the son of Thomas Cochrane , eighth earl of Dundonald (1691&#150;1778), and Jean Stuart (1722/3&#150;1808). His mother was keenly interested in technical matters. After brief service in both army and navy, he turned to scientific projects, applying chemical principles to manufacturing processes, though he never reaped financial rewards for his often brilliant ideas. He was married three times: on 17 October 1774 to Anne (1755&#150;1784), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10715/', "Captain James Gilchrist")</script>; on 12 April 1788 to Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1808), widow of John Mayne; and in April 1819 to Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter of the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22390/', "Francis Peter Plowden")</script>. The eldest son of his first marriage was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5757/', "Admiral Thomas Cochrane")</script>, the tenth earl; there were no children of the second and third marriages.<br>
<br>Cochrane, styled Lord Cochrane from 1758 to 1778, succeeded to the title earl of Dundonald on the death of his father on 27 June 1778, but the family estates were severely impoverished and he had to borrow money in order to equip his son for the navy. Nevertheless, the estate of Culross Abbey in Perthshire was well supplied with timber and coal, and the Lamancha estate 12 miles south of Edinburgh contained iron ore. He also had a house in Hammersmith. His son complained that the unentailed estates were crippled by his father's extensive scientific pursuits. Contemporaries did not always appreciate Dundonald's efforts&#151;he was sometimes known as &#145;daft Dundonald&#146;&#151;but the ninth earl was a man of active and enquiring mind who enjoyed the learned society afforded by Edinburgh and was on intimate terms with Joseph Black, the professor of chemistry. In literature on industrial history he is usually referred to as Lord Dundonald.<br>
<br>By the late eighteenth century a shortage of soda (commonly called alkali) was affecting all countries touched by the industrial revolution. In 1790 Dundonald joined the brothers John and William Losh in experiments on the production of synthetic soda from salt at Woodside near Carlisle. Three years later the results were sufficiently promising to justify setting up a works at Bells Close, west of Newcastle upon Tyne, where Dundonald had a tar distillery. In 1797 the Losh family inherited a share in a coalmine on the Tyne at Walker in which a brine spring had been discovered. This provided a private source of salt for making soda, though to avoid the heavy duty of &pound;36 per ton the salt had to be mixed with soot or ashes, and an exciseman lived on the site to see that the law was obeyed. Several of Dundonald's patents were worked at Walker, but all depended on the successful sale of by-products.<br>
<br>Meanwhile an efficient process for converting salt to soda had been developed in France by Nicolas Leblanc, and William Losh visited Paris at Dundonald's suggestion to learn what he could. The Walker works was the first in England to work the Leblanc process, the partners being lords Dundas and Dundonald, the Losh brothers, and bankers John and Aubone Surtees. The original partnership soon dissolved and the Losh brothers, trading as Walker Alkali Works, were able to develop a profitable chemical business in which Dundonald no longer had a part. The alkali trade spread to Lancashire and Cheshire, and became the backbone of the heavy chemical industry.<br>
<br>Another area in which Dundonald was a significant catalyst was coal-tar technology. During his naval service he had observed the ravages made on ships' bottoms by worms. Believing correctly that coal tar might provide a remedy which could be produced more cheaply than Stockholm tar made from dwindling supplies of wood, he designed and built retorts for the distillation of tar from coal at Culross Abbey. He also superintended the working of his adjacent collieries. He did not invent the production of tar from coal; his innovation, embodied in his 1781 patent, was to avoid the use of an external fuel, allowing coal in the retort to smoulder slowly by controlling the air intake. He envisaged a complete industrial package in which the tar would be used to protect ships' bottoms, the &#145;cinders&#146; (coke) would provide a clean fuel for salt boiling, malting, and brewing, and sal ammoniac from the ammonia liquors would be sold to calico printers and metal finishers. He also foresaw, but did not develop, the possibility of gas lighting. His vision of the tar industry is presented in his book <span class="italic">The Quality and Uses of Coal Tar and Coal Varnish</span> (1784).<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the Admiralty did not embrace the tar treatment, preferring to rely on copper sheathing. With one exception, Dundonald's creditors saw the potential of the tar process and were prepared to give him leeway to develop the concern. The dissident, named Cuthbert, pressed for foreclosure. Dundonald was thus forced to spread his risk (and reduce his hope of profit) by forming the British Tar Company, whose partners were Newcastle businessmen. The coal-tar industry was destined to become an important provider of dyes, perfumes, drugs, and explosives, but not within Dundonald's lifetime.<br>
<br>Dundonald was also active in a wide variety of other technological fields. He established a factory for the production of alum as a mordant for silk and calico printers. He published a <span class="italic">Treatise Showing the Intimate Connection between Agriculture and Chemistry</span> (1795), eighteen years before Sir Humphry Davy's famous work on that topic. He proposed the use of salt residues as manure, a new process for making white lead, the malting of grain for cattle feed, an improved method for preparing flax and hemp for sailcloth, and a scheme for purifying rock salt by washing out the impurities with brine.<br>
<br>Dundonald died at the rue Vaugirard, Paris, on 1 July 1831, in poverty. The Literary Fund Society had awarded him three grants (March 1815, April 1819, and April 1823; BL, Royal Literary Fund, loan 96)). His son Thomas wrote: &#145;His discoveries, now of national utility, ruined him and deprived his posterity of their remaining paternal inheritance&#146;  (Cochrane, 1.39). Later biographers have cast doubts both on his science and his business sense. In fact he possessed a sound knowledge of the chemical properties of common substances, and was quick to see the industrial possibilities in simple chemical reactions. The impoverished condition of the family estates when he inherited meant that he was never able to command the capital to sustain his experiments through the difficult periods of development. The examples of alkali and coal tar show that his confidence and enthusiasm were justified, though too late to mend his fortunes.<br>
