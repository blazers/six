<span class="headword">O'Connell, Sir  Maurice Charles Philip</span>  (1768&#150;1848), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial administrator in Australia</span>, was born in co. Kerry, Ireland, the son of Charles Philip O'Connell. Tall, strapping, and penniless, the son of a younger son, he was dependent on the bounty of his kinsman, Count Daniel O'Connell, of the Irish brigade. With this support he studied for two or three years in Paris for the Roman Catholic priesthood, but in 1785 his father arranged his entry to a military school, and in 1792 he became a captain in the French &eacute;migr&eacute; forces serving on the French frontier under the duke of Brunswick.<br>
<br>When the Irish brigade was taken into British pay O'Connell was appointed captain in Daniel O'Connell's 4th regiment of the Irish brigade, from 1 October 1794, and served with it in the West Indies until it was broken up and he was put on half pay. On 12 May 1800 he obtained a company in the 1st West India regiment with which he served in Surinam, Grenada, and Dominica. In January 1805 he was promoted brevet major and transferred to the 5th regiment. He saw much action in the West Indies, and particularly distinguished himself at Roseau in Dominica in February 1805 when it was unsuccessfully attacked by greatly superior French forces. In October 1806 he was transferred to the 73rd regiment, of which he became lieutenant-colonel on 4 May 1809.<br>
<br>In December 1809 the 1st battalion of the 73rd, with O'Connell in command, arrived in Port Jackson with the new governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie. O'Connell was commissioned lieutenant-governor in January 1810 and on 8 May, soon after his first arrival in Sydney, he married Mary Putland (1782/3&#150;1864), daughter and lifelong defender of the deposed governor William Bligh and widow of Lieutenant John Putland. He was appointed a trustee of the Female Orphan Institution, steward of the racecourse, and president of the Philanthropic Society. But by August 1813 Macquarie was urging the removal of O'Connell and the 73rd regiment from the colony.<br>
<br>In April 1814 O'Connell sailed for Ceylon with the regiment, which he commanded during the war in Kandy in 1815. He failed to obtain appointment to Van Diemen's Land as lieutenant-governor and retired on half pay on the return home of his troops. In 1819 he was promoted colonel, and in July 1830 major-general. He was knighted and made a KCH in 1834, became a lieutenant-general on 9 November 1841, and was appointed colonel of the 80th foot in 1844.<br>
<br>O'Connell returned to Sydney in 1838 having been appointed to command the forces in New South Wales. On his arrival he was appointed to the executive and legislative councils. In 1843&#150;4 he was a nominated member of the partly elected legislative council. When Governor Gipps departed in July 1846, O'Connell administered the government until the arrival of Sir Charles Fitzroy the next month. He was succeeded as commander of the forces in New South Wales by Major-General Wynyard in 1847. Thenceforth, he remained in the colony but took no part in public affairs. He died at Darlinghurst, Sydney, on 25 May 1848 and was buried at St James's Church, Sydney. His widow lived in Paris for some years and then in London, where she died in 1864. There were two sons and one daughter. The elder son was the well-known Australian statesman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20503/', "Sir Maurice Charles O'Connell")</script>.<br>
