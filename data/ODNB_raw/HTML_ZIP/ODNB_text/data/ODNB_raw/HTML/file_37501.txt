<span class="headword">Haines,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">farmer and pamphleteer</span>, was baptized on 4 or 14 May 1633, the eldest son of Gregory Haines, yeoman farmer of Shere in Surrey and Sullington in Sussex, and his wife, Elizabeth Pollard. He farmed at Sullington, near Horsham, and was the most prominent member of the Horsham Baptist congregation, of which Matthew Caffyn was minister. He styled himself &#145;gentleman&#146; and his publications show him to have been something of a virtuoso, interested in the state of agriculture, industry, and the national economy. He corresponded with members of the Royal Society, had lodgings in Christ Church parish, Newgate Street, London, and sought support for his projects at court, and in parliament and the City.<br>
<br>In 1672 Haines obtained a patent for a new method of cleaning trefoil so as to improve the seed, and this led to public controversy with Caffyn, who was himself a local farmer, jealous of Haines's influence with local notables, and convinced that patents were unchristian and patentees covetous. Haines published <span class="italic">New Lords, New Laws</span> (1674) in his own defence, but his excommunication by Caffyn was not finally overturned by the general Baptist assembly until 1680. Also in 1674 Haines published <span class="italic">The prevention of poverty, or, A discourse of the causes of the decay of trade, fall of lands, and want of money throughout the nation</span>, stressing the importance of the balance of trade and advocating a 25 per cent devaluation of shilling coins in order to stimulate domestic manufactures and discourage imports. In the following years, however, Haines turned his attention to workhouses as a panacea for national ills, after a visit to the Netherlands, where he admired Dutch methods of employing the poor.<br>
<br>In 1677 Haines published <span class="italic">Proposals for building, in every county, a working-alms-house or hospital, as the best expedient to perfect the trade and manufactory of linen cloth</span>. In 1678 he took out a patent for a simple &#145;engine&#146; that turned wheels for spinners of flax, and recommended county workhouses to parliament in <span class="italic">Provision for the Poor</span>. Further publications followed, all aimed at a parliamentary audience: <span class="italic">A Breviat of some Proposals for the Promoting of Industry</span> (1679), including wool as well as linen manufacture in the workhouse scheme; <span class="italic">A Method of Government for such Publick Working Alms-Houses</span> (1679), proposing the union of small parishes for workhouse purposes and the election of &#145;delegates or overseers&#146; by contributing parishes to oversee the new institutions; and finally <span class="italic">England's Weal and Prosperity Proposed</span> (1681), a summary statement. The Exclusion parliaments found no time to discuss Haines's scheme, but, along with the proposals of Thomas Firmin, whom Haines knew, it influenced later projects for reform of the poor laws.<br>
<br>Haines's last publication was <span class="italic">Aphorisms upon the New Way of Improving Cyder or Making Cyder-Royal</span> (1684), publicizing his third patent, for a method of doubling the strength of cider and so competing with imported wines and spirits, and including general advice on the management of orchards. His own farming seems not to have been profitable, however, perhaps because of his other activities; he and his heirs sold off over 500 acres in the late seventeenth century. He married Mary Green on 14 December 1654, and had seven children, three of whom (two sons and one daughter) survived infancy. He died in London on 29 May 1685 and was buried at Christ Church Greyfriars.<br>
