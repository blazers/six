<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morant,  Harry Harbord</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Breaker]</span>  (1864?&#150;1902), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, probably concealed his origins. He seems to have been Edwin Henry Murrant, born on 9 December 1864 at the union workhouse, Bridgwater, Somerset, the posthumous son of Edwin Murrant, master of the workhouse, and his wife, Catherine Riely (or O'Reilly). In 1883 he emigrated to Queensland and within a year married Daisy May O'Dwyer at Charters Towers on 13 March 1884. They soon separated, possibly because of his record of debt and larceny. As <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53778/', "Daisy Bates")</script> she became a notable researcher of Aboriginal customs.<br>
<br>Having adopted the surname Morant he led a roving life under that guise in several Australian states. Through his daring horsemanship and reckless feats, which gave rise to his nickname, the Breaker, he became a minor celebrity, but was also known as a brawler and hard drinker. Apparently self-educated he enjoyed good literature and music, and as the Breaker from 1891 contributed rollicking ballads to the Sydney <span class="italic">Bulletin</span> and other newspapers. In the 1890s he was a crony of A. B. &#145;Banjo&#146; Paterson, whose sardonic humour he shared. While Morant's verses were often redolent of a bushman's rough life in the outback, he projected himself successfully as a gentleman, the son of Admiral Sir George Digby Morant, a relationship which the admiral and his family later strongly denied.<br>
<br>Responding to an appeal for volunteers to serve in the South African War which began in October 1899, Morant enlisted for short service in the 2nd South Australian mounted rifles. He was stocky and, according to an official description in 1902, had grey eyes, a prominent nose, and was 5 feet 6&frac34; inches in height. An accomplished rider, he was promoted lance-corporal before the contingent sailed for Cape Town in January 1900. Australian horsemen fought on the central front under Major-General J. French and later in the drive through both Boer republics that led to the relief of Kimberley and the occupation of Pretoria on 5 June 1900. Morant was one of French's dispatch riders. At Pretoria he was detailed for a further short spell as dispatch rider to Bennet Burleigh, war correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, but was discharged as time-expired on 31 July 1900. It was probably at Pretoria that he met Lieutenant P. F. Hunt, who was temporarily in the military administration there. Hunt, a former officer in the 13th hussars, had served with French's scouts in the recent British advance. Hunt and Morant returned to England, where Morant seems to have been accepted readily in county and hunting circles. With the prolongation of the South African War into a guerrilla struggle, there was a fresh appeal for volunteers, especially riders and marksmen.<br>
<br>The imperial authorities raised several formations of irregulars in South Africa to counter Boer guerrillas, one of which was the bushveldt carbineers (BVC), which was established in February 1901. It attracted veterans, including a strong Australian constituent, and was to serve in a partially occupied region of the northern Transvaal. Morant, described as a &#145;gentleman&#146;, was commissioned lieutenant in the BVC on 1 April 1901 and his friend Hunt transferred to it as a captain soon after. Other commissioned officers closely linked to Morant's future were the Australians Veterinary-Lieutenant P. Handcock and Lieutenant G. Witton.<br>
<br>The BVC was operating in dispersed detachments by May 1901. To the south-east of its base at Pietersburg, Morant led B squadron efficiently and energetically. However A squadron, at remote Fort Edward to the north-east, had a weak commander, and because of indiscipline and rumours of serious offences Hunt replaced him. Morant's squadron moved to Fort Edward too, and the reorganized force, aided by a resourceful but ruthless intelligence officer, Captain Taylor from Rhodesia, sought out the enemy. In a raid on a Boer farm stronghold near Duiwelskloof on 6 August 1901 Hunt&#151;Morant's &#145;best mate&#146;&#151;was killed, as was Sergeant F. Eland, English by birth, who had been Morant's trusted subordinate in B squadron. Morant was already ill-disposed towards Boer guerrillas, having lost other friends when trains were attacked by them. He was incensed when he learned that Hunt's body had been stripped and mutilated, as he believed by the Boers, although the mutilation might have been performed by local medicine men.<br>
<br>Morant pursued the fleeing Boers, and when one of them, Visser, was taken wounded he was shot on 11 August without having had a proper trial. Morant, now commanding at Fort Edward, was vengeful. Egged on by Captain Taylor he gave short shrift to Boers who surrendered to the BVC, asserting that Lord Kitchener had given verbal orders that Boer prisoners should not be taken. On 23 August eight prisoners were shot, but a passing missionary, the Revd C. A. D. Heese of the Berlin Missionary Society, had spoken to them and was a potentially hostile witness. At Morant's behest, Handcock, a compliant accessory, followed the missionary, whose body was found later. On 7 September three more surrendered Boers were shot. Subsequently Morant undertook a raid into enemy territory which brought in a Boer field-cornet and nine men who, however, were not executed.<br>
<br>By 22 October 1901 Morant, Handcock, and several other BVC officers had been arrested. Among contributing factors the murder of Revd Heese was crucial. The missionary was a British subject born in Cape Colony, but as he had close German connections the German consul had voiced concern. Also important was a detailed list of allegations of excesses signed by fifteen troopers of the BVC at Pietersburg on 4 October.<br>
<br>A properly constituted court of inquiry was convened at Pietersburg on 16 October. Many depositions were recorded and witnesses mustered. Kitchener's chief legal specialist considered the court's recommendations, and consequently Morant, Handcock, and others appeared before a series of courts martial commencing on 17 January 1902. The proceedings were conducted in accordance with British military law. At short notice an Australian officer, Major J. F. Thomas, was appointed to defend the accused. After lengthy sessions involving more than forty witnesses, Morant was sentenced to death for his part in the shootings of Visser and the groups of eight and three Boers. Handcock and he were acquitted on the charge of Heese's murder. A spokesman of Kitchener denied that any secret orders not to take prisoners had been given. The court's findings were coupled with recommendations for mercy based on Morant's good service, ignorance of military law, and the provocation of the &#145;maltreatment&#146; of Hunt's body. However, no account was taken of the accused's part in defending Pietersburg against a surprise Boer attack on 23 January 1902. Kitchener confirmed death sentences on Morant and Handcock but commuted that on a third officer, Witton, to life imprisonment. Morant and Handcock were executed by a firing squad at the prison, Pretoria, on 27 February. They were buried in a common grave in the old cemetery there on the same day. Just before execution, Morant wrote some characteristic verses, &#145;Butchered to Make a Dutchman's Holiday&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>And if you'd earn a D.S.O.&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>Why every British sinner<br>
</div>
<div>Should know the proper way to go<br>
</div>
<div>Is: &#145;<i>Ask the Boer to dinner</i>&#146;<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>Let's toss a bumper down our throat<br>
</div>
<div>Before we pass to Heaven,<br>
</div>
<div>And toast: &#145;The trim-set petticoat<br>
</div>
<div>We leave behind in Devon.&#146;<br>
</div> (Semmler, 123)</blockquote>The executions gave rise to a minor furore in Australia. Witton's account of the trials, published in 1907, reinforced a burgeoning legend in which Morant was portrayed as a victim of a brutal Kitchener and a scapegoat of British imperialism. A considerable literature&#151;some romantic, some fictional&#151;as well as a notable film (<span class="italic">Breaker Morant</span>, with Edward Woodward), a play, and radio productions, were afterwards devoted to the supposed BVC martyrs. Speculation about Morant's origins entered into the myth-making. His character was complex, and while physical prowess and swagger won him many admirers, it was ultimately dishonesty and gross abuse of authority that were his undoing. On the eve of his execution he wrote to a Pretoria clergyman: &#145;We shot the Boers who killed and mutilated our friend (The best mate I had on Earth)&#146;.<br>
