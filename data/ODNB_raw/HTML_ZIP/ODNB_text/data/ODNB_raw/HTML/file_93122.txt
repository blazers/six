<span class="headword">Fulton,  Robert Kerr <span class="st"> [Rikki]</span></span>  (1924&#150;2004), <span class="occ">actor and comedian</span>, was born on 15 April 1924 at 46 Appin Road, Dennistoun, Glasgow, the third and youngest son of John Fulton (<i>d</i>. 1966), hardware salesman, and later stationer and newsagent, and his wife, Margaret McMillan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moffat (<i>d</i>. 1956). When Fulton was three the family moved to Riddrie, where he went to primary school, but then moved back to Dennistoun, where he attended Whitehill secondary school. After leaving school (where his talent for acting was already apparent) at fourteen, he worked as a customs clerk before volunteering for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) at the age of seventeen. After passing out as an ordinary seaman, he joined the anti-aircraft sloop HMS <i>Ibis</i> on 26 September 1942. When the ship was torpedoed off north Africa on 10 November two-thirds of the company perished, and Fulton was in the water for five hours before being rescued. Commissioned as a midshipman in the RNVR, he was posted as first lieutenant to a coastal forces motor launch, which, following D-day, plied ceaselessly between Gosport and the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches. He was promoted sub-lieutenant on his nineteenth birthday, but the strain of continuous operations eventually led to blackouts, and he was invalided out of the service for the remainder of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Back in Glasgow, while working as a manufacturer's agent, Rikki Fulton joined the amateur theatre group the Pantheon Club and soon gained his first radio work with the BBC, in <span class="italic">The Gowrie Conspiracy</span>, and as the Revd McCrepe in the popular series <span class="italic">The McFlannels</span>. He also appeared in <span class="italic">Scott of Abbotsford</span> for Perth Repertory Theatre. On 2 April 1949 he married Ethel Muriel Philpotts, a 23-year-old optical instrument research worker, and daughter of Frederick Philpotts, fish merchant. She was also an aspiring actress, with the stage name Ethel Scott, and later worked as Fulton's partner in revue.<br>
<br>In 1952 Fulton appeared in the film <span class="italic">Laxdale Hall</span> and in <span class="italic">Festival City</span> at the Gateway Theatre for the Edinburgh Festival. Between 1952 and 1955 he worked for the BBC in London as presenter and comp&egrave;re on a range of radio programmes, including <span class="italic">The Show Band Show</span>, <span class="italic">The Saturday Show</span> (with Alfred Marks), <span class="italic">Club Piccadilly</span>, and the television programme <span class="italic">Music Hall Time</span>. Over this period he worked with such leading names as Nat King Cole, Rosemary Clooney, and his idol, Frank Sinatra. In 1956 he returned to Scotland to begin a ten-year association with the production company Howard and Wyndham, appearing as dame in his first pantomime, <span class="italic">Goldilocks</span>, at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, with Jimmy Logan, and the following year in the company's glamorous revue, <span class="italic">The Five Past Eight Show</span>, with Alec Findlay and Kenneth McKellar. His elegant comic talents were perfectly suited to the revue format, which also offered an outlet for his writing. In 1960 he appeared in <span class="italic">A Wish For Jamie</span>, Howard and Wyndham's Scottish pantomime at the Alhambra, Glasgow, which proved so successful that it was repeated the following year, playing to 427,000 people, and spawning two sequels.<br>
<br>It was in the 1958 <span class="italic">Five Past Eight Show</span> with Stanley Baxter that Fulton first played in the sketch involving Francie and Josie, two Glasgow teddy boys. However, the characters came to life in the show's 1960 edition, at the Alhambra, Glasgow, and King's Theatre, Edinburgh, when he was paired with Jack Milroy. The sketch was initially put in as a short opener to the second half, where it was intended to draw the audience back from the bars. Fulton's and Milroy's natural rapport and ability to extemporize dialogue soon led to what became the Arbroath sketch, an excruciatingly distended scene in which Francie (Milroy) encourages his friend to tell again a funny story, which it transpires Josie (Fulton) has not only completely forgotten, in every detail, but also doesn't &#145;get&#146;. The full impact of the characters' popularity was not felt until the broadcast of STV's <span class="italic">The Adventures of Francie and Josie</span>, which led to queues around the King's Theatre, Glasgow, where the two were appearing, and to their being mobbed at public appearances. The two were named television and radio industries personalities of the year in 1963. The television show ran for three series, but a 1966 follow-up for STV, <span class="italic">The Rikki Fulton Hour</span>, proved a flop. Having separated from his first wife in August 1967 while appearing in Aberdeen, Fulton met Kate Matheson (1936&#150;2005), formerly Audrey Matheson Craig Brown, an actress and television newsreader who was the daughter of William Craig Brown, grocery sales representative. Immediately inseparable, they married on 13 August 1969 after Fulton's divorce.<br>
<br>In 1978 Fulton began the BBC television sketch show <span class="italic">Scotch and Wry</span>, which ran for fourteen years. A hogmanay institution, its gallery of characters included the blundering police motorcyclist Supercop, the Gallowgate Gourmet, Dirtie Dickie Dandruff, and, most famously, the Revd I. M. Jolly, a depressive Presbyterian minister whose lugubrious deadpan appearance in &#145;Last Call&#146;, a satirical take on &#145;Late Call&#146;, eventually led to a number of separate spinoffs. Although only once broadcast across the UK network, in 1982, the series was hugely popular in Scotland, at its height attracting 2 million viewers and outselling <span class="italic">Fawlty Towers</span> on its video release.<br>
<br>A hugely versatile performer, Rikki Fulton combined his work in television comedy and as a consummate pantomime dame with a wide range of stage and screen roles. His theatre appearances included Michael Frayn's <span class="italic">Liberty Hall</span> at the Greenwich Theatre, <span class="italic">Let Wives Tak Tent</span> (both 1981), and his own adaptation of Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</span>, <span class="italic">A Wee Touch o' Class</span>, for Perth Theatre and the 1985 and 1986 Edinburgh festivals. His television work included Autolycus in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (1981) and McPhail in <span class="italic">The Tales of Para Handy</span> (1993), while his film appearances included <span class="italic">The Dollar Bottom</span> (1981), a KGB officer in <span class="italic">Gorky Park</span> (1983), and roles in Bill Forsyth's <span class="italic">Local Hero</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">Comfort and Joy</span> (1984). His many awards included appointment as OBE in 1992, honorary doctorates from the universities of Strathclyde and Abertay, and a BAFTA lifetime achievement award in 1993. In 1996 Francie and Josie's <span class="italic">Nineteenth Final Farewell Performance</span> at the King's Theatre, Glasgow, played to rapt audiences. In 1997 Fulton was honoured by BBC Scotland for fifty years with the BBC, and in 1999 he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Is It That Time Already?</span>
<br>
<br>Fulton was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002. His and Kate's decision publicly to announce his condition was widely praised. In 2003 he appeared in a television documentary with Kirsty Wark about the devastating effects of the disease. His death at the Quayside Nursing Home, Halley Street, Glasgow, on 27 January 2004 was the occasion of an outpouring of tributes: a motion tabled in the Scottish parliament applauded his &#145;mesmerizing&#146; performances, while the first minister, Jack McConnell, described him as &#145;Mr Hogmanay&#146; and &#145;one of Scotland's great entertainers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Times</span>, 28 Jan 2004); John Swinney, leader of the Scottish National Party, termed him &#145;a national treasure&#146;  (ibid.). On 3 February Strathclyde police paid their own tribute to Supercop by providing police motorcyclists to escort the funeral cort&egrave;ge to Clydebank crematorium. It was a further measure of the enormous affection in which he was held that in September 2006 a staged tribute, <span class="italic">Rikki and Me</span>, based on Kate Fulton's autobiography of 2004, played to packed houses at the King's Theatre, Glasgow. Kate Fulton was by then also dead, having survived her husband by less than fifteen months; many papers suggested that she had died of a broken heart. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
