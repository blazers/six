<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whymper,  Josiah Wood</span>  (1813&#150;1903), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and watercolour painter</span>, was born on 24 April 1813 at Stoke Green, Ipswich, the second son of Nathaniel Whimper, a brewer and town councillor in Ipswich, and his wife, Elizabeth Orris. The Whimper family was a well-established aristocratic family in Suffolk. After 1840 Josiah adopted what he considered the original spelling of his name, Whymper. His early works are signed &#145;Whimper Sc&#146;, or JW Whimper; later works are signed JW Whymper. He was educated at private schools in Ipswich and then apprenticed to a stonemason because he wished to become a sculptor; a near-fatal accident in the mason's yard terminated his apprenticeship before he was sixteen. When his mother died in 1829 he went to London hoping to join a sculptor's studio, but was dissuaded from this profession by John C. F. Rossi RA. He taught himself to draw and from 1829 studied watercolour painting with W. Collingwood Smith. He and his brother Ebenezzar Whymper set up a wood-engraving business, working in London from premises at 31 Paradise Road, Lambeth.<br>
<br>Work on orders for shop notices led to commissions from Charles Knight for <span class="italic">Arabian Nights' Entertainments</span> (1839), <span class="italic">Pictorial Shakespeare</span>, and <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>. Josiah Whymper established himself as an illustrator with an etching of New London Bridge on the occasion of its opening (1831), which made &pound;30 profit. Finding that his brother was too irresponsible to share in the running of the business, he moved to new premises at 20 Canterbury Place, Lambeth, about 1842. In 1837 he married Elizabeth Whitworth Claridge (1819&#150;1859), and they had nine sons and two daughters. He intended his sons to continue his business. &#145;But shall we finally keep to this&#151;I think, in fact I <i>know</i> we shall not&#146;, he wrote in his diary  (Engen, 286). The sons who followed his plan most successfully were Alfred, who was sent to train with the Edinburgh printer R. Clark in 1857, and Frederick, Charles, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36884/', "Edward Whymper")</script>, who were trained by Josiah as draughtsmen on wood. Edward eventually took over the business. Josiah was also master to an impressive succession of apprentices who were to become some of the most prominent draughtsmen of the &#145;Sixties school&#146;: Frederick Walker, Charles Keene, J. W. North, Charles Green, and G. J. Pinwell. His wood-engraving business became one of the most thriving in London, taking on most of the work for John Murray the publishers, for the Religious Tract Society, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Fine examples of his book illustrations are those in Scott's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (Black, 1857); <span class="italic">Picturesque Europe</span> (Cassell, 1876&#150;9); some of Murray's editions of Byron's <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span> and Schliemann's <span class="italic">Works</span>; 190 engravings after Joseph Wolf for C. A. John's <span class="italic">British Birds in their Haunts</span> (1862); and twenty engravings after Wolf for <span class="italic">Life and Habits of Wild Animals</span> (1873&#150;4), produced with his son Edward. Whymper also engraved for periodicals such as <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (1855) and <span class="italic">Sunday at Home</span> (1869). He engraved a large number of illustrations by Sir John Gilbert, his friend and constant travelling companion for watercolour sketching: <span class="italic">Lady of the Lake</span> (1853) and <span class="italic">Lay of the Last Minstrel</span> (1854) are two of the finest examples. Whymper was also a competent draughtsman illustrator, often engraving his own natural history illustrations. These appeared in C. R. Conder's <span class="italic">Child's History of Jerusalem</span> (1874), L. J. Jenning's <span class="italic">Field Paths and Green Lanes</span> (1877), and C. R. Conder's <span class="italic">Tent Work in Palestine</span> (1878). Although his engraving work did not allow him much time to pursue watercolour painting, he exhibited frequently at the New Watercolour Society from 1844, where he was elected associate in 1854 and member in 1857; and also at the Society of British Artists, the Royal Academy, and the Royal Institute of Painters in Oil-Colours. His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1859, and in 1866 he married Emily Hepburn (<i>d</i>. 1886), a talented watercolour painter, who exhibited watercolour landscapes at the Royal Academy in 1877&#150;8 and the Royal Institute in 1883&#150;5. She was also a draughtsman illustrator and illustrated <span class="italic">Beauty in Common Things</span> (1874). By 1882 Whymper's engraving business at 43 and 45 Lambeth Road was jointly managed with his son Edward and appeared in the directories as J. W. and Edward Whymper, draughtsmen and engravers on wood. From 1859 he had a country house at Haslemere, Surrey, but did not finally retire from his work in London until 1884, when Edward took over the firm, continuing to run it throughout the 1890s. During Josiah's career the Whymper name had established an excellent reputation for high-quality wood-engraving. He died at his home, Town House, Haslemere, on 7 April 1903, and was buried in Haslemere churchyard. Collections of his work are held at the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
