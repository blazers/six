<span class="headword">Lees <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Craven]</span>,  Florence Sarah</span>  (1840&#150;1922), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born in Blandford, Dorset, on 31 March 1840, the eldest daughter in the family of three daughters and three sons of Henry Lees, physician, and his wife, Sarah Matilda (1802&#150;1883), daughter of John Phythian, surgeon, and widow of William Adams of Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, surgeon, with whom she had a son. Henry Lees deserted the family, who were rescued from imminent penury by the son of Sarah Matilda Lees's first marriage, Edward Charles Adams (1827&#150;1819), fellow, tutor, and dean of Worcester College, Oxford. He brought up his half-sisters, and had them educated, sending Florence to school in London. In 1864 the family moved to St Leonards, where Florence helped her mother in visiting the sick, an activity that probably dated from their time in Oxford. In 1866 she went to the Nightingale school at St Thomas's Hospital, London, as an observer for four months, as her mother would not allow her to be a probationer. During the following year she visited Germany and studied at the Kaiserswerth institute under Pastor Fliedner, subsequently visiting and studying in hospitals in Europe.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War Florence Lees volunteered for military nursing, and the crown princess of Germany, Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, put her in charge of a hospital at Marange, and later at Homburg. For her services she was awarded the cross of the German order of merit. After the war she studied in the United States and was impressed by the ideas of Palmer Howard, who maintained that nurses should be educated in the manner of medical students and pay for their training. Florence Lees argued, with some justification, that the current nurse training, even at St Thomas's, was deficient and did not give a systematic, planned education and that it failed to attract educated ladies looking for a worthwhile career. This was anathema to Florence Nightingale, who pointed out that &#145;the object was to encourage ladies to work&#146;. Nightingale was also fearful of producing what she called &#145;medical women&#146;. She maintained that &#145;the less knowledge of medicine that the matron has the better (1) because it does not improve her sanitary practice (2) because it would make her miserable and intolerable to doctors&#146;  (Cope, 121). The nurse must not only nurse, she must promote sanitary science, a subject in which she thought doctors were deficient. Later she did modify her views on medical lectures though she was always ambivalent as to whether the nurse should be the doctor's assistant or an autonomous practitioner. However, she was at one with Florence Lees in arguing against William Rathbone and the Liverpool concept of district nurses as welfare workers supervised by a ladies voluntary committee, insisting that the district nurse must have a higher training and be accountable to a superintendent who was herself a highly trained nurse.<br>
<br>In 1874 Florence Lees was asked to make a survey of the hospitals and nursing practices in London to see if a scheme such as hers would be viable. This she did almost single-handed, leaving a useful picture of the nursing situation in London at that time. As a result, with the help of the order of St John, the Metropolitan and National Nursing Association was founded to provide trained nursing for London with its headquarters in Bloomsbury and Miss Lees as the superintendent. After much controversy she converted the committee to the idea of a district nursing service as a corps of trained, educated women under the superintendence of a highly trained nurse. For this reason Florence Lees can be considered the founder of modern district nursing.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1879 Florence Lees married the Revd Dacre Craven (<i>d</i>. 1922), son of Major Charles Cooley Craven. It was a happy marriage: Dacre Craven supported her work and became the secretary to the home in Bloomsbury Square. They had two sons, the empress of Germany and Florence Nightingale being godparents to the elder, who committed suicide in 1928; the younger was killed in 1917. In 1887 Florence Craven, backed by the empress, and together with Florence Nightingale and William Rathbone, persuaded Queen Victoria to devote most of the women's jubilee offering to establish a national district nursing service. Using the Metropolitan and National Nursing Association as a model thus was established Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses (later the Queen's Nursing Institute): the queen's nurses. Mrs Craven served on the council and advised on training and in 1889 published <span class="italic">Guide to District Nurses and Home Nursing</span>, which became the vade-mecum for district nurses for many years. She was awarded the jubilee medal and the cross of St John of Jerusalem and remained, together with her husband, closely associated with district nursing until they retired to Essex in 1918.<br>
<br>Florence Craven died on 19 October 1922 at her home, 3 East Terrace, Walton on the Naze, Essex, two months after her husband, saying that she could not live without him. She was buried at Walton on the Naze, where there is a fine brass memorial to the Craven family in the parish church.<br>
