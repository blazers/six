<span class="headword">Hill,  Edwin</span>  (1793&#150;1876), <span class="occ">civil servant and inventor of postal machinery</span>, was born on 25 November 1793 at Birmingham, the second of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13313/', "Thomas Wright Hill (1763&#150;1851)")</script>, schoolmaster, and his wife, Sarah Lea (1765&#150;1842), daughter of William Lea. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13286/', "Matthew Davenport Hill")</script>, and his younger brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13299/', "Rowland Hill")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54053/', "Frederic Hill")</script>. Like his brothers, he was educated at his father's school and then set to teach there while still a boy. Later he took a post at the assay office in Birmingham and subsequently at a brass-rolling mill, also in Birmingham, where he rose to be manager. He was one of the signatories of the notice convening the Birmingham meeting of 22 January 1817 to petition for parliamentary reform. In 1819 he and his brother Matthew married sisters, respectively Anne (1793&#150;1873) and Margaret Bucknall. Edwin and Anne had ten children, seven of whom survived him.<br>
<br>In 1827, when the family school extended to Bruce Castle, Tottenham, in addition to the existing establishment at Hazelwood, Birmingham, Edwin Hill joined the enterprise and moved to Tottenham where Rowland took charge of the teaching. Edwin was mostly concerned with the commercial management, being too much interested in his mechanical experiments to give up much of his time to teaching. In 1840, with penny postage about to commence, it was necessary to expand the stamp office. Stamps had long existed as a tax-collecting device, but now the Inland Revenue was to supply the Post Office with the new postage stamps. Rowland was appointed to the Treasury to oversee the introduction of the system, and Edwin applied for the stamp-producing appointment, asking Charles Babbage for a reference in support. Here he remained, joined later by his son Ormond, until his retirement in 1872.<br>
<br>Edwin's best-known invention was a machine for folding envelopes, which was shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851, though the patent had by then been bought by Warren De la Rue to whom it was there attributed. He invented many mechanical contrivances for the stamp department. At his retirement, a Treasury minute paid tribute to &#145;his resourcefulness and considerable mechanical ability which had contributed so much to the success of the new postage scheme&#146;. He published pamphlets on currency (1848 and 1856) in which he was concerned with maintaining stability of monetary value while overcoming the swings of the business cycle between expansion and depression. He also published two pamphlets entitled <span class="italic">Criminal Capitalists</span> (1870 and 1872) arguing that all enterprises needed both labour and capital, while the attack on crime was directed almost entirely at the labourers; he believed that a drive against landlords who housed criminals and receivers of stolen goods would be more productive. In particular, he wished to redefine the law to make it an offence to receive goods <i>believing</i> them to be stolen. He died on 6 November 1876 at his home, 1 St Mark's Square, close to the entrance to the London Zoo, and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
