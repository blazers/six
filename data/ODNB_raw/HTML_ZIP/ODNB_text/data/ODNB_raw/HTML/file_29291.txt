<span class="headword">Whitehead,  John</span>  (1739/40&#150;1804), <span class="occ">physician and biographer</span>, was born, apparently in Dukinfield, Cheshire, one of at least three sons of &#145;humble&#146; and allegedly Methodist parents, though they appear to have belonged originally to the dissenting chapel in Dukinfield until joining the Moravians in 1738. Whitehead was brought up as a weaver but received a classical education, probably at the Moravian school in Dukinfield. He was converted in the early 1760s by Matthew Mayer, a leading Methodist local preacher. He became a local preacher and did some teaching, but from 1764 to 1769 he was an itinerant Methodist preacher. With Wesley's encouragement he spent some of his time at Wesley's Kingswood School to improve his Latin and Greek and had hopes of becoming a master there.<br>
<br>After marrying Ann Smith, Wesley's housekeeper at Bristol New Room Chapel, on 25 July 1769 he ceased to be a travelling preacher because of his wife's health. He then set up business on credit in Bristol, first in the tobacco trade, then as a linen draper, but was unsuccessful and had to compound with his creditors. Methodist friends subscribed to send him to Staines, near London, as a schoolmaster where he joined the Society of Friends under his wife's influence. With Quaker support he set up a successful boarding-school in Wandsworth. The leading Quaker physician, John Coakley Lettsom, advised him to study medicine, and the Quaker brewer David Barclay paid him a life annuity of &pound;100 to travel with his son on the continent. He entered as a medical student at Leiden on 16 September 1779 and graduated MD on 4 February 1780. On 19 January 1781 he became a physician at Lettsom's London dispensary. He was admitted LRCP on 25 March 1782 but in 1784 failed on a technicality to secure election as physician to the London Hospital, despite Quaker support. He acquired a post at the Bethlem Hospital but also had a private practice, probably chiefly among the Methodists. He was Wesley's physician and attended his deathbed, and Wesley thought highly of his skill.<br>
<br>In 1784 Whitehead rejoined the Methodists as a local preacher, though it is said that in 1790 he offered to resume itinerating if Wesley would ordain him as a superintending minister, but the offer was ignored. In 1791 he preached Wesley's funeral sermon, sales of which raised &pound;200 for Methodist funds.<br>
<br>Wesley left his papers to Thomas Coke, Henry Moore, and Whitehead, to deal with as they thought fit. As a response to John Hampson's controversial life of Wesley (1791), Whitehead was commissioned to write what was advertised in a broadsheet entitled <span class="italic">Proposals</span> (6 July 1791) as &#145;a full accurate and impartial life&#146; of Wesley. Very soon, however, Whitehead fell out with Coke and Moore and other preachers, and an acrimonious verbal and pamphlet warfare ensued. The main disputes were over three issues. First, what should be paid to Whitehead for the work, and what to the Methodist fund for preachers' pensions. Second, who should own the copyright&#151;for (at least in Whitehead's view) connexional possession of copyright would allow for censorship of his work. Third, since Whitehead insisted on keeping Wesley's papers until he had completed the biography, his fellow executors complained that this prevented them from fulfilling Wesley's will that they should decide jointly on disposal of the papers. Whitehead contended that his main concern was to secure copyright to avoid censorship. It was a fear that may well have been justified, despite his critics' claim that they merely wished to keep the copyright to increase the benefits for the charity. In addition, Whitehead also expected to be paid for his work, and the terms he demanded certainly increased in the course of the controversy. His detractors claimed that they had assumed Whitehead was working for the benefit of the preachers' fund, though they soon offered a fee. The dispute over copyright went to law, but the proceedings were stayed and the London Society paid costs of over &pound;2000. Meanwhile, Whitehead was removed from the list of preachers and lost his membership of the society, though he was restored in 1797.<br>
<br>The dispute was complicated and aggravated by the fact that it became part of wider and deeper disputes within Methodism. These included power struggles between the conference, made up of travelling preachers, and chapel trustees and local preachers, as well as between the conference and the trustees of Wesley's publications&#151;an important source of Methodist finance. Methodism was also divided on ordinations and sacraments, and Whitehead blamed Wesley's ordinations on pressure from ambitious preachers. He was supported by laymen opposed to the conference.<br>
<br>To damage the prospects (and profits) of Whitehead's book, the preachers hastily commissioned an official biography of Wesley by Coke and Moore (1792) and circulated the Methodists vigorously to buy it. Whitehead's biography appeared in two volumes (1793, 1796) and included a life of Charles Wesley. The book was not commercially very successful, being reprinted only once (1806). Yet, despite its prejudices, it is superior to most nineteenth-century biographies of Wesley. It is noteworthy that Moore in his <span class="italic">Life of Wesley</span> (1824&#150;5), despite criticizing Whitehead, frequently quotes him without acknowledgement, and both drew on Hampson. Hampson's and Whitehead's critical appraisals of Wesley's character remain valuable.<br>
<br>Apart from the Wesley biography and controversial pamphlets about it, Whitehead published two medical works, as well as attacks on A. M. Toplady's Calvinism (1775) and on Joseph Priestley's materialism (1778). Evidence is lacking for a clear view of Whitehead's character, but consciousness of his humble origins may have sharpened his evident pride in his status as a literary and professional man and his disdain for what he saw as the inferior culture of the Methodist preachers. No record of his appearance seems to have been preserved. He appears to have been twice married: certainly to Ann Smith, already noted; but his will of 1804 names his wife as Mary, and mentions a son who had predeceased him. He died at his residence, Fountain Court, Old Bethlem, London, on 7 March 1804 and was buried in Wesley's tomb behind City Road Chapel, London, on 14 March 1804.<br>
