<span class="headword">Treffry <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Austen]</span>,  Joseph Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1782, <em>d.</em> 1850), <span class="occ">mining industrialist</span>, was baptized Joseph Thomas Austen at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, on 1 May 1782, the eldest child in the family of one son and two daughters of Joseph Austen (<i>d</i>. 1786), of The Friary, Plymouth, brewer and sometime mayor of Plymouth, and his wife, Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1842), daughter of Thomas Treffry of Place, Fowey, Cornwall. She and her sister Jane inherited the Treffry estate in Cornwall in 1779 following the death first of their father and then their brother, William Esco Treffry. After the death of her husband in 1786, Susanna and her children moved to Place. Her two daughters died young, Susanna aged sixteen and Sarah in infancy; but she herself lived long, until only eight years before the death of her son.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Austen's early education. He was at Exeter College, Oxford, from 1801 to 1804, but left without graduating. He returned to Place and became involved in the management of the small family estate, which had been badly neglected for many years. Taking advantage of high wartime agricultural prices he sought to improve the profitability of the estate's farms and acquired more agricultural land. From about 1815 he turned his attention to the more lucrative prospect of mining by adding to the estate's shareholdings in local copper and tin mines. By 1820 he had acquired control of Wheal Treasure, near St Austell, which was later combined with neighbouring mines and renamed Fowey Consols. At its peak in 1837 this was the second largest producer of copper in Cornwall. His other large copper mine, Par Consols, came into production in 1840.<br>
<br>The success of Austen's mining ventures owed much to his investment in good transport facilities. He built and owned ships to handle his business and made a quay at Fowey, on the south coast. Being unable to link his mines to the port with a railway because of opposition from a landowner, he created an entirely new port at Par which was opened in 1833, complete with an inclined plane railway and canal to serve the nearby mines. He further diversified his business interests, though they remained local and related. He built his own smelting works at Par, and the port was later linked by railway to the Luxulyan granite quarries, which he also owned and developed. In 1836 he bought the pier and harbour of Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall; this was convenient for shipping the lead from the East Wheal Rose mine, and the china clay and stone from his quarries. He also sought to connect Cornwall with the main national railway system. From 1844 to 1846 he was chairman of the provisional committee established for the purpose, and he presided over the board of the Cornwall Railway from 1846 to 1850.<br>
<br>As a young man, Austen entered forcefully into local politics and strengthened his position in the town by purchasing property and allying himself with the enemies of the unreformed municipal corporation of Fowey. While appearing a fiery radical, his politics were individual and never doctrinaire. Although his political activities gave way to business interests, he briefly entered the political arena at a national level in the early 1840s; this led to an unsuccessful campaign by Cornish mine owners against the proposed reduction of import duties on copper ore as part of Robert Peel's tariff reforms.<br>
<br>Austen took great pride in the Treffry heritage, and in 1838 he fulfilled a long-standing wish to take the name Treffry. To ensure the continuation of the name he left the bulk of his estate to a cousin, the Revd Edward John Wilcocks, provided that he also took the family name. Treffry devoted much time to restore and develop Place, which had become partly derelict. The house was visited by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in September 1846, though Treffry was too ill to receive them. Treffry also improved the estate with a substantial tree-planting programme.<br>
<br>Treffry served as a magistrate and was high sheriff of Cornwall in 1838&#150;9; he was also a committee member of the East Cornwall Agricultural Society, a patron of the Tywardreath Gardening Society, and vice-president of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society from 1849 until his death. He died at Place, unmarried, on 29 January 1850, after several years of serious illness.<br>
