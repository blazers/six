<span class="headword">Exshaw,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1771), <span class="occ">painter and art dealer</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of John Exshaw (<i>d</i>. 1746). He trained there under Francis Bindon, who may have encouraged him to travel abroad. Exshaw left Dublin in 1747 to study in Paris and Rome; he presumably went straight to Paris as he was awarded a medal at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1749. This had distinct resonance back home where the international success of a local youth was greeted as a great triumph.<br>
<br>After his stay in France, Exshaw went on to Flanders and then Italy, where one &#145;Carlos Exshaw&#146; is recorded as passing through Capua in the company of the artist Richard Hayward on 27 September 1753. During his travels Exshaw assembled a large collection of paintings and on his return to Dublin in 1755 hired Geminiani's rooms to auction this &#145;curious and valuable collection of paintings, statuary and drawings&#146;  (Strickland), the first of a number of sales Exshaw was to hold. The catalogue announced that the artist would soon return to Italy to continue collecting for the Dublin market. True to his promise, Exshaw departed for the continent soon after, but went first to France to continue his studies under Charles Van Loo before returning to Italy. In the first years of the 1760s Exshaw divided his time between making and buying art. In Amsterdam, for example, he etched several sensitive plates after Rembrandt, notably <span class="italic">St Peter's Bark in a Storm</span>; he also purchased the art collection of Count Colloredo. After his return to Ireland, this block purchase formed the basis of his next two sales at Geminiani's auction rooms.<br>
<br>Evidently Exshaw had some skill as an entrepreneur but apart from his sales of foreign art he had few notable successes. In 1762 he attempted to establish a drawing academy at his London lodgings in Maiden Lane. The comment by Edward Edwards on the &#145;pompous advertisement announcing &hellip; drawing in the manner of the Caracci&#146; is, no doubt, indicative. Only two pupils subscribed to Exshaw's academy and so the venture failed. With his painting <span class="italic">Edward the Black Prince at the Battle of Cressy</span>, Exshaw was also unsuccessful in his attempt to win the Society of Arts' premium for history painting in 1764.<br>
<br>The rest of Exshaw's career appears uneventful. Living in London at Mr Rummer's in Denmark Street, Soho, he exhibited two paintings at the Society of Arts in 1764 including <span class="italic">A View of Salisbury from Harnham Hill</span>. Charles Exshaw died early in 1771, probably in London, and his drawings and pictures were sold in April 1771 at Exeter Change.<br>
