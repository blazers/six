</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lovelace,  Richard</span>  (1617&#150;1657), <span class="occ">poet and army officer</span>, was born on 9 December 1617, the eldest of five sons and the second of eight children of Sir William Lovelace the younger (<i>bap</i>. 1584, <i>d</i>. 1627) of Woolwich, Kent, and his wife, Anne Barnes (<i>d</i>. 1632/3), the only daughter of a wealthy merchant, Sir William Barnes. Court documents relating to an action taken by Sir William Barnes against Richard Lovelace's grandfather Sir William Lovelace the elder (1561&#150;1629) show that William and Anne married &#145;on or about 17 May 1611&#146;. Their first daughter was born about 1612, and there were no further children until Richard's birth in December 1617  (TNA: PRO, WARD 7/77/128), perhaps because the couple may have lived apart following their marriage. Later in 1611 William's patron Viscount L'Isle had been informed that his charge &#145;leadeth a moste leaude and wicked lyfe &hellip; and as often as he is drunck shee is forsed to hyde herself from his outragious sworde&#146;  (De L'Isle and Dudley MSS, 4.286). Before his death at the siege of Groll (12 August 1627) Sir William Lovelace the younger had, as his widow notes, &#145;served about thirty yeares in the warres&#146;, part of which time she was with him &#145;in the Low Countries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, xvi). Later their son Richard would also live in the Netherlands; he too would follow the family tradition of military service. His grandfather Sir William Lovelace the elder had been knighted by the lord lieutenant of Ireland during Essex's 1599 Irish campaign; other forebears further justified the contemporary reputation of the Lovelaces as &#145;a Race of Gentlemen &hellip; who have in Military Affairs atcheived Reputation and Honour, with a prodigal Losse and Expence&#146;  (T. Philipot, <span class="italic">Villare Cantianum</span>, 1659, 72). Though Richard Lovelace's military exploits are largely unrecorded, chivalric honour has long been associated with his life and poetry.<h2>
<a name="StudyatOxfordandCambridge"></a>Study at Oxford and Cambridge</h2>The essential source of his biography, Anthony Wood's account in <span class="italic">Athenae Oxoniensis</span> (1691), states that Lovelace studied at Charterhouse School, though other than a 1629 petition of the widowed mother on behalf of &#145;one of hir Sonnes&#146; no records have survived. A warrant in the Public Record Office dated 5 May 1631 does, however, document the appointment of Richard Lovelace to the honorary position of &#145;A Gent Wayter extraordinary&#146; to the king  (Berry and Timings, 396). He matriculated as a gentleman commoner at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, on 27 June 1634, &#145;being then accounted the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld, a person also of innate modesty, virtue and courtly deportment&#146;; two years later he received a master of arts degree, not merely because he had won the favour of a &#145;great lady belonging to the queen&#146; as Wood suggests  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.460). Among the &#145;persons of quality&#146; honoured with this degree on 31 August 1636 at the conclusion of Charles and Henrietta Maria's visit to Oxford, the strikingly handsome, remarkably prepossessing young man had by then shown a precocious literary promise by writing a comedy entitled <span class="italic">The Scholars</span>. The only parts of the play that remain, the prologue and epilogue, indicate that Henrietta Maria's company performed the comedy at Whitefriars, probably after late 1637, when the theatres closed by the plague reopened. Meanwhile, if Wood is correct, Lovelace &#145;retired in great splendor to the court&#146;. But he did not abandon the scholarly world: at Cambridge his name was entered in the book of subscriptions on 4 October 1637.<br>
<br>During an indeterminate stay at Cambridge, Lovelace probably met Andrew Marvell and some of the other writers who later commended the publication of his first volume of poetry; his relationship with Oxford and the court, however, occasioned his first datable poems. An elegiac piece by &#145;Rich. Lovelace. Mag. Art. A. Glouc.&#146; was added to the Oxford University collection of verse, <span class="italic">Musarum Oxoniensium Charisteria</span> (1639), commemorating the 20 January 1639 death of the infant Princess Catherine. Among the contributors was Anthony Hodges, whose translation of a Greek romance Lovelace had praised the year before in verses prefaced to its Oxford publication, and George Ashwell, perhaps the &#145;learned Friend&#146; G. A. similarly honoured in another prefatory poem. Court connections may then have brought Lovelace and the earl of Norwich's son George, Lord Goring, together, for with the outbreak of the bishops' wars the former Oxford poet and playwright served in Goring's regiment as an ensign and later a captain. The royalist poem to General Goring written after the first Scottish expedition ended badly at Berwick in June 1639 softens the defeat of a peace achieved &#145;at the Foes rate&#146; with rounds of drink celebrating the general and his wife Lettice. During the second unsuccessful campaign the next year Lovelace apparently expressed a more sombre note in <span class="italic">The Soldier</span>, an unpublished tragedy that was not staged before the theatres were closed in 1642 and was later lost.<h2>
<a name="Confindtopeaceduringthecivilwar"></a>Confin'd to peace during the civil war</h2>With the cessation of armed hostility Lovelace withdrew to Kent and the family estate at Bethersden, which under the terms of his father's will became part of his inheritance on his twenty-fourth birthday  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/153/167). Lovelace quickly became embroiled in the growing national conflict. On 29 April 1642 he and other young Kent royalists disrupted the Maidstone quarter sessions at which parliament supporters were discussing a response to the moderate Kentish petition advocating, among other local concerns, &#145;just and regal authority&#146;  (Everitt, 97). The intruders &#145;in a furious manner cried, &#147;No, No, No&#148;, and then with great contempt of court clapped on their hats&#146;; raising a copy of the parliamentarian counter petition above his head, Captain Richard Lovelace tore it to pieces  (Steele Young and Snow, 2.249). At the head of between 280 and 500 Kent supporters, Lovelace then marched from Blackheath to London. The next day, 30 April, he and Sir William Boteler delivered to the House of Commons a petition similar to the one already burnt by the hangman. For their defiance Lovelace was sent to the Gatehouse at Westminster and Boteler committed to the Fleet. During the seven weeks spent in prison Lovelace possibly, though not probably, &#145;made that celebrated song called Stone Walls do not a Prison make, &amp;c&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.461). A petition from prison written in his own hand does survive, however, requesting &#145;conditionall freedome&#146; and the opportunity to serve &#145;his Kinge and Countrie&#146; in Ireland  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, xxxviii&#150;xxxix). After he was released on bail on 21 June his whereabouts are less certain.<br>
<br>Lovelace seems to have taken no active role in the military conflicts that threatened the monarchy; instead he appears to have been, in the words of his close friend and distant cousin Thomas Stanley,<blockquote>
<div>During our Civill Wars confin'd to peace,<br>
</div>
<div>Expos'd to Forrein Wars, when ours did cease.<br>
</div> (T. Stanley, &#145;Register of Friends&#146;, in <span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, ed. G. M. Crump, 1962, 360)</blockquote>Part of that confinement was passed in London; there, Wood reports, Lovelace lived beyond his means &#145;by furnishing men with horse and arms, or by relieving ingenious men in want, whether scholars, musicians, soldiers, &amp;c&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.462). The precarious nature of his financial position may have derived from his disposal of the family's property around Bethersden between June 1642 and September 1648, presumably in the royalist cause  (CKS, U2035 T8&#150;T11, T17/1, T18/1). Lovelace's presence, if not his patronage, is apparent in the 1643 dedication to him of poems written by Henry Glapthorne, who the year before had named his daughter Lovelis. William Lawes also set three of Lovelace's lyrics to music during this period, and the first of the manuscript versions of &#145;To Althea, from Prison&#146; began to circulate. But Lovelace did not remain solely in London. A poem, &#145;Upon my Noble Friend, <i>Richard Lovelace</i>&#146;, written no later than 1645 by John Tatham stresses the absence of the author's friend, &#145;his being in Holland&#146;  (J. Tatham, <span class="italic">Ostella</span>, 1650, 82&#150;3). Another by Samuel Holland published in broadside recalls that France and Holland had found Lovelace &#145;excellent in Arms, and Art&#146;  (&#145;On the Death of my much Honoured Friend, Colonel <i>Richard Lovelace</i>&#146;, 1660?). Although no record of military service in Holland has been found, he may have accompanied Goring on the mission in late 1642 to recruit volunteers from the English soldiers there. Lovelace's poem on the exiled queen of Bohemia's daughter Louise Hollandine does confirm his presence in The Hague, where his &#145;Art&#146; might have been both developed and known. Unlike his brothers, one of whom was mortally wounded during a royalist campaign in Wales, he may well have taken up arms only in France. He was in the service of the French at Dunkirk, and Wood reports that he was wounded before the siege ended in October 1646.<br>
<br>Back in England by 1647, Lovelace seems to have been among the authors gathered at Stanley's Middle Temple chambers. By then the reputation of his &#145;Art&#146; was not limited to poetry. Along with Peter Lely he and two others were given the freedom of the Painter&#150;Stainers Company on 26 October 1647, the same year he contributed one of the poems prefaced to the folio edition of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher. A year later he was once again imprisoned. Marvell's claim that his lands were sequestered, however, has not been corroborated from extant records in the National Archives. Some time in October, following a search of his lodging in connection with the 1648 uprising in Kent, he was committed to Peterhouse &#145;upon pretence of answering some matters contained in papers of his&#146;  (D. Gardiner, ed., <span class="italic">The Oxinden and Peyton Letters</span>, 1937, 145). While in prison, Wood believes, &#145;he fram'd &hellip; for the press&#146; the collection dedicated to his relative Anne Lovelace entitled <span class="italic">Lucasta</span>.<h2>
<a name="The1648Lucasta"></a>The 1648 Lucasta</h2>The volume of poems licensed on 4 February 1648 and entered for publication on 14 May 1649, a month after Lovelace's release from Peterhouse, was not written during his incarceration; nor has the Lucasta said to have inspired them been identified with any certainty. The licensing implies the completion of a collection whose publication was delayed, Marvell speculates in one of the dedicatory poems, because Lovelace had supported the Kentish petition, &#145;wrong'd&#146; the &#145;Houses Priviledge&#146;, and was now &#145;under sequestration&#146;. The &#145;gentlewoman of great beauty and fortune named Lucy Sacheverel&#146;, who in Wood's account married soon after she heard falsely that Lovelace was fatally wounded at Dunkirk, appears at the very least to have been someone the poet knew, though the suggestions that she was the daughter of Ferdinando Sacheverel or a member of the Lucas family remain unsubstantiated. She is in the poetry &#145;Lucasta that Bright Northerne Star&#146;, literally perhaps from the north but figuratively <i>lux casta</i> or pure light. As such she recalls William Habington's Castara and to a lesser extent Edmund Waller's Sacharissa or Thomas Carew's Caelia. Among the other verses in the volume to Althea, Amarantha, Ellinda, and Gratiana, those to Lucasta are not limited to deft variations of Petrarchan conventions or graceful formulations of Caroline compliment. Her symbolic light illuminates a darkening world of civil conflict.<br>
<br>The love and honour commonly associated with Lovelace's cavalier loyalties and unmistakable in the initial poems addressed to Lucasta &#145;Going beyond the Seas&#146; and &#145;Going to the Warres&#146; are distinctly Caroline and chivalric. Lucasta resembles the transcendence and inspiration celebrated in the court masques; the lovers' world of Mars and Venus recalls on a lesser scale the valour of Rubens's <span class="italic">Landscape with St. George and the Dragon</span>. The royal dimensions of her radiance and his own devotion are explicit in a poem written about the time of the Kentish petitions, &#145;To Lucasta: from Prison&#146;. England itself metaphorically becomes the prison, and the king both displaces and merges with Lucasta as the light that might dispel the enveloping world of darkness. By the end of the volume in &#145;Calling Lucasta from her Retirement&#146; a triumphant Lucasta assumes the mythic proportions accorded the royal couple in the Whitehall masques; the hope that she too can reorder the world is, however, now limited to the realm of the lovers. Ultimately the long pastoral &#145;Amarantha&#146; added to the completed collection abandons the world of Mars and its honour for the love the poems have come to value more.<br>
<br>Though Lovelace recognizes the destruction and futility of civil war, the poems in <span class="italic">Lucasta</span> never forsake a loyalist commitment, embracing neutralism or succumbing to disillusionment. The poem he allegedly wrote in the Gatehouse, &#145;To Althea, from Prison&#146;, stoically sings the goodness and greatness of the king. &#145;Stone Walls&#146; and &#145;Iron bars&#146; cannot confine &#145;Mindes innocent and quiet&#146;. It is a belief affirmed in his complex royalist tribute to the image of Charles and his son James captured by Peter Lely in the portrait painted at Hampton Court by late 1647. The tacit recognition of the king's separation from his wife adds a poignant note to the heroic resolve Lovelace sees in &#145;griefe triumphant&#146; despite &#145;clouded Majesty&#146;. Earlier he encouraged Francis Lovelace to accept the battlefield death of their brother William with a similar &#145;firme selfe&#146; and &#145;thorough-made Resolve&#146;. Caught now in the bleak winter realities of &#145;The Grasse-hopper&#146;, a poem fraught with royalist overtones, Lovelace assures Charles Cotton that together they can recreate &#145;A Genuine Summer in each others breast&#146;. The friendship, abundant wine, and good poetry celebrated in this justly famous poem are meant to sustain the spirits of loyalists forced to turn inward.<h2>
<a name="Theposthumouspoems"></a>The posthumous poems</h2>The volume of poetry entered in the Stationers' register on 14 November 1659 and published posthumously the next year by Lovelace's brother Dudley Posthumus and Eldred Revett reflects the suffering brought about by the civil war. The extent of Lovelace's diminished fortunes after the sale of his Bethersden estate and his whereabouts after his release from prison are not, however, entirely resolved. The secretary of state, John Thurloe, believed Lovelace maintained his association with the royalist cause, at least until a few years before his death. He appears to have been implicated in the failed Ship tavern conspiracy of early 1654 and was named as being &#145;of the council&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thurloe State Papers</span>, 2.96, 114). Though Lovelace was not questioned after the conspiracy's discovery he was clearly concerned for his status. According to a letter received by Thurloe on 21 March 1654 &#145;Col Lovelace &hellip; sent one Mr Doubledee &hellip; to desire to know, what was against him, and wished me to inquire the utmost&#146;  (ibid., 2.183). And while the association of &#145;Colonel Lovelace&#146; with Richard Lovelace is not absolute it seems likely that it was he, rather than his younger brother, who was always known as &#145;Colonel Francis Lovelace&#146;. As well as involvement in the Ship tavern plot, Lovelace may have been in Holland during part of this time; later in London he might also have been subjected to the searches in 1656 for royalists in the city who had not posted required securities. An allusion to William Davenant in the Sanazar satire and the dating of Revett's elegy on Lovelace, in any event, indicate that the poet died in 1657 (Duncan-Jones, 408&#150;9; <span class="italic">Poems</span>, liv). Wood made considerable efforts to find out the circumstances of Lovelace's death. On his behalf Sir Edward Sherburne established from Lovelace's sister, Joan Caesar, that &#145;she was at his ffunerall, being buried in St Brides Church London, in which Parish he dyed coming from the Country of a sicknesse he had there taken&#146;  (LMA, ACC/3259/SF3/004). <span class="italic">Lucasta: Posthume Poems</span> and its appended <span class="italic">Elegies Sacred to the Memory of the Author</span> question the image Wood creates of an increasingly melancholic author reduced to dependence upon the charity of his friends before his death. None of the elegies mentions the dire straits, which Wood elsewhere says are the curse of poets; the various poems Lovelace addressed to his peers in the last years of his life suggest, moreover, that he was neither isolated nor disconsolate, though his tribute to Charles Cotton and especially the long final poem on Sanazar may convey personal dismay about the lot of the writer. Whatever his level of poverty at the time of his death, Lovelace's life after the king's execution and his release from prison altered but did not entirely transform his spirited convictions.<br>
<br>Though the much less familiar poems in Lovelace's posthumous collection were long ignored as decidedly inferior, their increasing sense of detachment and even alienation provides a valuable complement to the first volume. Lucasta's light belongs to the initial poems, her radiance now dimmer and more limited. Opposing her invitation to sportful play in the last of the Lucasta poems is the austere ant, an obvious counterpart to the grasshopper. In a significant series of poems the fates of the ant, the fly, the spider, the falcon, and the toad bleakly underscore the realization that all are caught up in consuming forces, destroyed as they themselves destroy. Without the conviviality celebrated in the earlier poems, libertine abandonment is attractive; the graceful saraband of the previous volume becomes a drunken dance suited to a reeling world scornful of honour. An alternative, however, is the composure of the self-contained snail and the brave struggle of the dying falcon to rise triumphant. In a benighted and treacherous world Lovelace can still counsel his brother Francis once again to defy fate; he also sees in Charles Cotton a semblance of the enclosed life celebrated in the earlier grasshopper poem addressed to Cotton's father. While the optimism is tempered, the final poem, &#145;On Sanazar's being Honoured&#146;, nevertheless invokes a spirit of stoic integrity despite isolation and rejection.<br>
<br>Together the two volumes of <span class="italic">Lucasta</span> modify the long-established impression that Lovelace is an uneven, careless poet who wrote several memorable verses. The handsome features in the Dulwich portrait, a painting that re-enforces a common comparison to Sir Philip Sidney, only adds to the romantic biography of a dashing poet driven by his lofty ideals to imprisonment, poverty, and early death. The poems themselves, especially those in the posthumous publication, challenge the stereotype of chivalric love and cavalier honour. Sensitive to the earlier writing of John Donne as well as Ben Jonson and an influence on the verse of Andrew Marvell, Richard Lovelace embodied in his life and poetry the loyalties, conflicts, and violent loss of the Caroline world.<br>
<br>The two volumes of <span class="italic">Lucasta</span> are the only legacy of the poet who never married; contemporary paintings, engravings, and songs, however, further confirm the spirit of his life and poetry. Besides the portrait of &#145;Colonel Lovelace&#146; in the Dulwich Picture Gallery, an oil painting at Worcester College, Oxford, attributed to John de Critz is said to be the young Lovelace richly robed in the academic regalia of the Oxford MA. A Wenceslaus Hollar engraving depicts Lovelace in his early twenties; another Hollar engraving of the poet drawn by his brother Francis appears in <span class="italic">Lucasta: Posthume Poems</span>. Lovelace is also seen as Orpheus in an engraving attributed to Richard Gaywood, and engraved variations of the Dulwich portrait exist. Musicians Lovelace knew at court or in private circles set sixteen of the poems in <span class="italic">Lucasta</span> to music; many of the songs in the settings of Henry Lawes, Thomas Charles, John Gamble, John Cave, and John Wilson are reprinted in Wilkinson's 1925 Oxford edition and in a series of articles by Willa McClung Evans. Numerous twentieth-century musical transcriptions and recordings attest to the enduring attraction of Richard Lovelace's lyric poetry.<br>
