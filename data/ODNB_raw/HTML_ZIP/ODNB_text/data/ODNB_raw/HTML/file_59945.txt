<span class="headword">Kendall,  Henry Edward</span>  (1776&#150;1875), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 23 March 1776 in York. A pupil of Thomas Leverton (1743&#150;1824), who was helped early in his career by Kendall's banker father, he may also have worked in the office of John Nash (1752&#150;1835) before entering the barrack department of the War Office, where he remained until appointed (1823) surveyor to the districts of St Martin-in-the-Fields and St Anne, Soho, positions he held for half a century. He was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy (1799&#150;1843). Twice married, his first wife, Ann (1793/4&#150;1863), bore him four children: two sons, Henry Edward Kendall junior (1805&#150;1885) and Charles (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1840), and two daughters, one of whom, Sophia, married his pupil Lewis Cubitt. He married secondly, Matilda Alice Clowser (<i>d</i>. 1876), daughter of Samuel Clowser, on 1 March 1866.<br>
<br>In 1825&#150;7 Kendall completed the Gothic church of St George, Ramsgate, Kent, commenced in 1824 to designs by Henry Hemsley (<i>d</i>. 1825): its west tower was derived from Boston Stump, Lincolnshire. This was followed by: Christ Church, Cockfosters, Middlesex (1829); Holy Trinity Church, Claygate, Surrey (1840; exhibited RA, 1841); the remodelling of Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury Street, London (1846; dem.); and a church at Bantry, co. Cork, Ireland (1840s).<br>
<br>Kendall's output was stylistically varied, rising occasionally to distinction: the Greek-Doric sessions-house and house of correction (1824&#150;6) at Spilsby, Lincolnshire, plans of which were published in Christopher Davy's <span class="italic">Architectural Precedents: with Notes and Observations</span>, 1841, is a good example of his work. He also designed two other Lincolnshire houses of correction, at Spalding (1824) and Louth (1828; exhibited RA, 1829). In 1828 he submitted Classical and Gothic entries for the competition to build the sessions-house at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, winning with a Tudor Gothic essay (completed 1831), and, in the same town, designed the east range and chapel of the Tudor Gothic Carr's Hospital almshouses (1830), and (probably) the south range (1841&#150;6). In 1832 he won the competition for the design of the buildings at Kensal Green cemetery, Middlesex, with proposals in the Gothic style which were published in <span class="italic">Sketches of the Approved Designs of a Chapel and Gateway Entrances &hellip; at Kensal Green</span> (1832) with lithographs by Thomas Allom, but Gothic met with opposition, and the buildings later erected to designs by John Griffith of Finsbury (1796&#150;1888) were in the Greek revival style.<br>
<br>With John Douglas Hopkins (<i>d</i>. 1869) Kendall entered Gothic proposals for the Houses of Parliament competition (1835), won by Charles Barry. By the early 1830s his son Henry Edward Kendall junior was working with him, and together they carried out various schemes, including: the esplanade and tunnel, Kemp Town, Brighton (1828&#150;30); houses at Brighton, including 19&#150;20 Sussex Square (1829&#150;31); and the hotel, pier, and gardens at Rosherville, Northfleet, near Gravesend (1837). Kendall designed the workhouses at Uckfield, Sussex, and Semington, Wiltshire (1836&#150;9); the school for blind children in St John's Wood, London (1838); the corn exchange, Sudbury, Suffolk (1841&#150;2); the rectories at Tillington, near Petworth, Sussex (1817&#150;18; exhibited RA, 1818), and Fishtoft, Lincolnshire (1826; dem.); 24 Belgrave Square, London, a handsome Greek-Ionic composition (1827&#150;33); the remodelling of Haverholme Priory, Lincolnshire (1830; dem.; exhibited RA, 1830); Ashurst Lodge, Surrey (<i>c</i>.1835; exhibited RA, 1838); additions to The Castle, Chiddingstone, Kent (1837&#150;8; exhibited RA, 1838); and sundry works at Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire (1842&#150;5).<br>
<br>With his son Henry, Kendall helped to found the Institute of British Architects; early meetings to that end were held in his house, 17 Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, London, in 1834, the year in which he was elected a fellow of the institute.<br>
<br>Tall, handsome, generous, with refined and gentlemanly manners, Kendall was personally successful. A competent architect, his houses were among the finest of his time, and he was a master of scenic and picturesque effects, as his developments at Brighton and Rosherville demonstrated. In old age he was called the Nestor of British architecture  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 33, 9 Jan 1875, 33). He died at home at 78 Dean Street, Soho, London, on 4 January 1875 and was buried on 12 January 1875 in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
