<span class="headword">Mac Maghnusa,  Cathal  &Oacute;g</span> <span class="st"> [Charles MacManus, Cathal  &Oacute;g Mac Maghnusa Mh&eacute;ig Uidhir, Charles MacManus Maguire]</span>  (1439&#150;1498), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the son of Cathal &Oacute;g Mac Maghnusa (<i>d</i>. 1480) and, presumably, of his wife, Gr&aacute;inne (<i>d</i>. 1462), the daughter of Tom&aacute;s &Oacute;g M&aacute;g Uidhir, king of Fermanagh (<i>d</i>. 1480), and grandson of Cathal M&oacute;r Mac Maghnusa (<i>d</i>. 1433). He is best known as the compiler of the annals of Ulster. He was born in February 1439 and in 1488 he was inaugurated as head of the Mac Maghnusa sept, distant relations of the M&aacute;g Uidhir dynasty, the greater part of whose royal mensal lands were held by the Mic Mhaghnusa, &#145;free from all common charges and contributions of the country, because they yielded a large proportion of butter and meal and other provisions for M'Guire's table&#146;, as Sir John Davies observed in 1607  (Morley, 368). The hereditary Mac Maghnusa title was <i>biatach</i> (&#145;food-provider&#146;) or <i>brughaidh</i> (&#145;hospitaller&#146;), referring not only to their obligations towards the king of Fermanagh, but also to their provision of public hospitality by maintaining a guest house for travellers, and especially for bardic troops, a customary charity in medieval Ireland.<br>
<br>Mac Maghnusa's estates were centred on Belleisle (Seanadh Mic Mhaghnusa) on Lough Erne, but he also entered the church (the bishop of Clogher diocese from 1448 to 1483 was his maternal uncle). He became parson of Iniskeen on Lough Erne, canon choral of Armagh and Clogher cathedrals, rural dean of Lough Erne (a deanery containing twelve churches), and episcopal vicar-general for the same area during a period of vacancy and disputed succession in Clogher diocese from 1483 to 1498. An eighteenth-century tradition that he held these ecclesiastical posts as a layman may be based on his being the proud father of a number of children: these included two daughters called Catherina (<i>b</i>. 1475 and 1477) and one named Gr&aacute;inne (<i>d</i>. 1497), sons Cathal &Oacute;g (1476&#150;1494), Edward (<i>b</i>. 1479), Cormac (<i>b</i>. 1482), C&uacute;chonnacht (<i>b</i>. 1485), and Magonius 
    (Mathghamhain or Maghnus; <i>b</i>. 1486)
  , and his heir, Tom&aacute;s Giolla-Baod&aacute;in, the &#145;official&#146;, or ecclesiastical judge, of Clogher diocese. However, approving references to &#145;wives&#146; and children of the higher clergy abound in Mac Maghnusa's own annals and either he himself or his son Tom&aacute;s was married to Siobh&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. 1515), daughter of Bishop M&aacute;g Br&aacute;daigh of Kilmore diocese.<br>
<br>Apart from its frank and detailed record of society in fifteenth-century Fermanagh, the original manuscript of the annals of Ulster (Trinity College, Dublin, MS H.1.8), whose entries begin with the first century of the Christian era and continue after the death of Mac Maghnusa to 1504, is remarkable for its comparatively accurate dates and the scrupulous care taken to distinguish between the text of a series of annal entries of early Christian origin and additional material derived from later sources&#151;an enormously useful decision. An entry for 1497 records Mac Maghnusa himself destroying the cave of St Patrick's purgatory in response to papal orders. The complaints about extortions from pilgrims which gave rise to this decree may include Mac Maghnusa among the accused, though it erroneously refers to the &#145;bishop&#146; (rather than vicar-general) of the vacant see of Clogher. Predictably, the notice of his death (from smallpox) as it appears in the brief continuation of his own annals for 23 March of the following year, gives him an elevated character quite incompatible with this suggestion.<br>
