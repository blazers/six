<span class="headword">Dod,  Timothy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7729/', "John Dod (1550&#150;1645)")</script>, clergyman, and his first wife, Ann Bownd. He matriculated in 1612 from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1616 and proceeded MA in 1619. He, or a namesake, was admitted to the University of Leiden on 3 June 1620. He was married to Jane Combes, widow of the London haberdasher Richard Combes, some time before 1642. It is likely that he was a lecturer in Daventry, Northamptonshire, in the 1630s as Mr Samuel Sutton of the town, who died in 1636, left him 10<i>s</i>. in his will to preach his funeral sermon. In mid-1637 Timothy was one of the signatories of a document containing nine questions to the clergy of New England concerning church government. It is reported that Dod was publicly ordained in Daventry some time after 1640. He became the afternoon lecturer and because he was a very popular preacher the residents of the town contributed &pound;40 per annum to his income.<br>
<br>Some time in 1644 Dod went to London. On 25 July 1644 he was admitted interim rector of St Peter Westcheap and in October was appointed by the Westminster assembly to the examining body of twenty-three City presbyterian ministers responsible for approving and ordaining candidates for the ministry, set up in response to a parliamentary ordinance and the perceived lack of properly educated and competent ministers. On 20 March 1645 he became vicar of Daventry, but was removed in 1646, when in January he was confirmed as rector of St Peter Westcheap, where one John Dod was among the ruling elders. His stay in London proved to be short because he informed his congregation in June 1646 that he was returning to Daventry, although he remained at St Peter's until Easter 1647. During the years of the protectorate Dod remained active in Northamptonshire and in August 1654 became an assistant to the commissioners responsible for ejecting &#145;Scandalous, Ignorant and Insufficient Ministers and Schoolmasters&#146;  (Firth and Rait, 2.982). The famous and much-repeated story told about Dod is that he was so corpulent in his later years that he could not mount the pulpit, so had to preach either from a pew or sitting behind a desk.<br>
<br>In 1662 Dod seems again to have been officiating as lecturer in Daventry. His wife died there that summer and was buried on 26 August. Simultaneously, as the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> was enforced, Dod was ejected from his place. He became very ill with gout and other ailments. He eventually moved to Everdon, where he died on 12 December 1665 and was buried. His son John, a clergyman of Hinton, was granted administration of his estate the following month.<br>
