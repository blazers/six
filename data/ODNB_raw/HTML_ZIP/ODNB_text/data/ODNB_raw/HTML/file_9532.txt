<span class="headword">Fitzalan,  John (VI)</span>, seventh earl of Arundel  (1408&#150;1435), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was born on 14 February 1408 at Lytchett Matravers, Dorset. He was the son of John (V) Fitzalan, Baron Maltravers (<i>d</i>. 21 April 1421) and Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1455), daughter of Sir John Berkeley of Beverstone, Gloucestershire, who afterwards married Sir Richard Ponyngs (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1430) and Walter, Baron Hungerford (<i>d</i>. 1449). John (V) held the Maltravers barony by inheritance through his grandmother Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1405), granddaughter and heir of John, Lord Maltravers (<i>d</i>. 1364), but his claim, after the death of Earl Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1415), to the earldom of Arundel as great-nephew and heir male of Earl Richard, who was executed in 1397, was contested by the heirs general, the Mowbray earls of Norfolk, into which Thomas's sister Elizabeth had married, and the families of the late earl's other two sisters. At John (V)'s death in 1421, although the heirs general acquired a considerable portion of the estate, the issue was still unsettled, and remained so during John (VI)'s minority. Not until 1433 did he have his title confirmed by parliament. He was contracted as a minor to Constance, daughter of John Cornewall, Baron Fanhope (who had held the custody of some of John (V)'s lands during his minority), and Elizabeth, daughter of John of Gaunt. She died before 1429, by which date he had married his second wife, Maud (<i>d</i>. 1436), daughter of Robert Lovell and Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Guy Bryan, and widow of Sir Richard Stafford (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1427).<br>
<br>Described as Lord Maltravers, Fitzalan was knighted at Leicester at Whitsun 1426 together with the infant Henry VI and other young peers, and was summoned to parliament by this title on attaining his majority (12 July 1429). He was, however, already calling himself earl of Arundel and his indenture for service in the king's expedition to France in 1430 was made in this name. He disembarked with Henry VI at Calais on 23 April and in June served at the siege of Compi&egrave;gne under John, duke of Bedford. Co-operating with a Burgundian force, he compelled Barbazon to raise the siege of Anglure. In the summer of 1431 he defended the Beauvaisis and took part in the capture of Potron de Saintrailles. He was present at the coronation of Henry VI in Paris on 17 December 1431 and was applauded for his prowess in the jousting which followed.<br>
<br>Arundel had already marked himself out as a worthy soldier. The next four years were devoted to military service in defence of Henry's French interests. On 18 November 1431 he was appointed to the key position of lieutenant in Bedford's garrisons at Rouen, an appointment he still held in March 1433. From late November 1431 to Michaelmas 1434 he was also captain of Vernon and, from at least January 1432 to his death, captain of Verneuil. His skills were soon put to the test when in February 1432 he was surprised in his bed at Rouen Castle by an anti-English plot led by Ricarville. The latter seized the castle but was forced to surrender twelve days later. On 14 January 1432 Arundel had been appointed to the first of a series of regional commands in northern France, and was partially successful in attempting to recover fortresses in the &Icirc;le-de-France, although he could not take Lagny-sur-Marne, despite preventing the inhabitants from reaching their outer bulwark by blowing up the bridge with a bombard. In December 1432 he defended St L&ocirc; from the turncoat Ralph Tesson. Although appointed to a new regional command in Upper Normandy on 11 December 1432 he was diverted to the siege of S&eacute;es in March 1433 and in July took up a new appointment as lieutenant-general in Lower Normandy. He recovered St Celerin, Sill&eacute;-le-Guillaume, and Beaumont-le-Vicomte by early 1434, although in December 1433 Bedford had, from England, changed his command again to Upper Normandy, appointing him also captain of Pont-de-l'Arche.<br>
<br>On 14 May 1434 Arundel indented to furnish troops for an expeditionary army from England; it is possible that he had returned to England briefly at this stage. By the end of May John, Lord Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1453) had replaced him as lieutenant in Upper Normandy and he had been diverted to a new command between the Seine and Loire, receiving on 8 September 1434 a grant of the duchy of Touraine, anticipating perhaps that he should campaign in this French-held area. He was appointed captain of St L&ocirc; on 20 October 1434, and held the office until his death. He was called upon to cope not only with the excesses of English pillagers in Lower Normandy but also with the full-scale revolt which had erupted in the Bessin by the end of the year and which became linked with an attempt by the duke of Alen&ccedil;on against Avranches. He successfully pre-empted this French advance and the revolt petered out. He attended the council at Rouen in April 1435 and in the following month was at Mantes when he was ordered to advance to Gournay. Hearing that the French had refortified the nearby fortress of Gerberoy, he hastened to attack it. The French had gathered a large force there and most of the English fell back in panic to Gournay but Arundel attempted to stand his ground. Many around him were killed, and he himself was wounded in the foot by a shot from a culverin and was taken as a prisoner to Beauvais. Basin claimed that he was distraught at being defeated by what he considered feeble opposition and that, victim of his own pride, he refused the medication that might have helped his wound. His leg was amputated and he died on 12 June 1435. Waurin claims that he was buried in the &Eacute;glise des Cordeliers at Beauvais but the will of Fulk Eyton (<i>d</i>. 1454), a Shropshire esquire who had served in the wars, suggests that the latter ransomed his remains from the French and sold them to the earl's executors so that the earl might be buried, according to the wishes of his own will, in the chapel of the church in Arundel. When the vault beneath the tomb which bears his two effigies, in full armour and as a cadaver, was opened in the mid-nineteenth century, a skeleton about six feet tall was discovered, with one leg missing. Humphrey, born on 30 January 1429, Arundel's son with his second wife, Maud (who died on 19 May 1436), succeeded him in the earldom but died while still a minor on 24 April 1438. The earldom thus passed to Arundel's younger brother William (1417&#150;1487), who received livery of his lands in November 1438 when of full age.<br>
<br>Arundel's death was a considerable blow to the English and an equally great boost to the French, testimony to his importance as a military leader. Several French chronicles stress his unpopularity among the local population, not surprising perhaps when he had been so closely involved in suppressing rebellion.<br>
