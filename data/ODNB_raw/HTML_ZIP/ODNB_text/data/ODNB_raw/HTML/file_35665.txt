<span class="headword">Ramsden,  Omar</span>  (1873&#150;1939), <span class="occ">silver designer</span>, was born on 21 August 1873 at 16 Fir Street, Nether Hallam, Walkley, Sheffield, the only son of Benjamin Woolhouse Ramsden (1833&#150;<i>c</i>.1898), engraver and cutlery manufacturer, and his wife, Norah (1850&#150;1929), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ibbotson, whose family dealt in ivory.<br>
<br>Ramsden was apprenticed to a silver manufacturer in Sheffield by 1887, learning basic skills and workshop practice. From 1894 he won annual scholarships to study design at Sheffield School of Art, where he met Alwyn Charles Ellison Carr (1872&#150;1940). They attended summer schools at the Royal College of Art, and studied in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1897 Ramsden won an open competition for a civic mace for the city of Sheffield, but he and Carr spent a year travelling in Europe before moving to London to set up a workshop and begin work on the mace. A joint mark for Ramsden and Carr was registered in 1898. The partnership prospered until 1914, and work of this period shows close study of Renaissance silver, with both arts and crafts and art nouveau influences. Their most important commission, in 1906, was a monstrance for Westminster Cathedral.<br>
<br>In 1914 Carr joined the army, and Ramsden continued independently, building up a team of specialist workers for the increasing volume of commissions, registering his own mark in 1918. The partnership was formally dissolved in 1919. Ramsden kept the Chelsea studio, St Dunstan's, and the workshop in Maxwell Road, Fulham, and over the next two decades maintained a reputation as a fashionable designer of domestic, ceremonial, and church plate catering to the conservative taste of a moneyed inter-war society. His designs drew on Renaissance metalwork, and showed an awareness of the work of George Jensen (1866&#150;1935).<br>
<br>During the early 1920s Ramsden became interested in mazers, turned burr-maple bowls with silver mounts. He made a large number, culminating in the <span class="italic">Three Kings Mazer</span> of 1937. The following year he published privately an illustrated booklet tracing the history of mazers. In addition to larger pieces of silver Ramsden produced quantities of personal objects, including jewellery, in silver with cabochons and enamel in medieval or art nouveau styles. In 1928 he designed an elaborate crown for a Madonna in Westminster Cathedral, reusing stones from jewellery given as votive offerings. He also made an &#145;everyday&#146; crown, and in 1935 a morse or clasp for a bishop's cope. He was commissioned in 1929 by the Honourable Company of Master Mariners for a spectacular ceremonial collar, one of several such orders from City livery companies.<br>
<br>At his Maxwell Road workshop Ramsden employed up to twenty men, including apprentices. Some spent nearly forty years in the spartan shop under the taciturn Ramsden's strict discipline. Surviving workbooks and working drawings record orders carried out between 1921 and 1939, costed in code. Despite the claim &#145;Omar Ramsden me fecit&#146; on every piece, Ramsden worked only rarely at the bench and his role was principally to interpret customers' requirements for execution by the workshop. His championship of hand craftsmanship is challenged in that production pieces were usually spun by external contractors for finishing in the workshop.<br>
<br>From the beginning St Dunstan's Studio had acted as a showroom where customers were received and stock displayed, and studio sales became a social event. Ramsden's genial charm towards his customers and skill as a salesman ensured the momentum of his success, helped by his flair for publicity and the business skills of his wife, Annie Emily Downes-Butcher, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berrif (1871&#150;1950), whom he married in St Augustine's, Kensington, London, on 3 September 1927. He died at St Dunstan's on 9 August 1939 and was buried in Ecclesall, near Sheffield. There were no children.<br>
<br>Ramsden was regarded as an authority on his craft, and frequently participated in professional debates. In 1928 he contributed articles on modern silver design to the <span class="italic">Goldsmiths' Journal</span>. Acclaimed in his day by his patrons and by the press as almost a latterday Cellini, and awarded many professional honours, Ramsden was later regarded as no more than a brilliant entrepreneur. Today he is recognized as influential in the revival of public taste in silver design, evocatively combining traditional and modern styles. Collections of Ramsden's work are held at Goldsmiths' Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum, St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield, and Westminster Cathedral, London; Birmingham City Museum, Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield, and the Campbell Collection, Toronto. Other examples are in public and private collections including churches and City livery companies.<br>
