<span class="headword">Perry,  George Gresley</span>  (1820&#150;1897), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, born at Churchill in Somerset on 21 December 1820, was the twelfth and youngest child of William Perry, an intimate friend and neighbour of Hannah More. He was educated at Ilminster under the Revd John Allen, and in 1837 he won a scholarship on the Bath and Wells foundation at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1840 he graduated BA with a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>. His scholarship would have entitled him to a fellowship at Corpus in due course, but meanwhile a vacancy occurred in the Wells fellowship at Lincoln College, for which Perry was the successful competitor, Mark Pattison, who was then just beginning his intellectual reform of the college, strongly pressing his claims. He graduated MA in 1843, and was ordained by the bishop of Oxford: deacon in 1844 and priest in 1845. He held for a short time, first, the curacy of Wick on the coast of Somerset, and then that of Combe Florey, near Taunton; but in 1847 he returned to Oxford as college tutor at Lincoln, which office he held until 1852. During the last year of his fellowship occurred the memorable contest for the rectorship, described with such painful vividness in Pattison's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. In this contest Perry took a leading and characteristically straightforward part. It was he who first told Pattison that the junior fellows wished to have him for their head, and from first to last he supported Pattison heartily.<br>
<br>In 1852 Perry accepted the college living of Waddington, near Lincoln, and there he remained to the end of his days. He entered upon his duties on Low Sunday, 1852, and the next October married Eliza, sister of George Salmon, at one time provost of Trinity College, Dublin; it was a most happy union. They had three sons and four daughters, five of his children surviving him. His wife died in 1877.<br>
<br>The life of a country clergyman suited Perry. He was always fond of country pursuits, understood the minds of country people, and could profitably employ the leisure which such a life afforded. He attended well to his country parish, and also threw himself heartily into the work of the diocese, which showed, as far as it could, its appreciation of him. In 1861 Bishop Jackson made him a non-residentiary canon and rural dean of Longoboby; in 1867 his brother clergy elected him as their proctor in convocation; and they continued to re-elect him (more than once after a contest) until he voluntarily retired in 1893. In 1894 Bishop King appointed him to the archdeaconry of Stow, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Perry's parochial and diocesan work still left him time for study, which he used for the benefit of the church. The earliest work which brought him into notice in the literary world was his <span class="italic">History of the Church of England</span> (3 vols., 1860&#150;64). Its fairness and accuracy were at once recognized, and its value was increased by the fact that it was the first general history which included the then unfashionable period of the eighteenth century, previous historians, as a rule, having stopped short at the revolution of 1688. In the 1860s he published several minor works and in 1868 short lives of Henry Hammond and Robert Boyle. In 1872 came a book which greatly enhanced his reputation, the <span class="italic">Life of Bishop Grosseteste</span>. His intimate knowledge of the University of Oxford and also of the diocese of Lincoln, with both of which Grosseteste was so closely connected, made the task a labour of love to him, and enabled him to carry it out successfully. This was followed in 1879 by an equally good <span class="italic">Life of St Hugh of Avalon, Bishop of Lincoln</span>, though of course he had here to come into competition with the <span class="italic">Magna vita</span> (Rolls Series). His <span class="italic">History of the Reformation in England</span> (1886), written for the <span class="roman">Epochs of Church History</span> series edited by Mandell Creighton, gave scope for the development of Perry's most characteristic merits&#151;his power of condensation and of seizing the salient points of a subject, his fairness, and his accuracy. Moreover, although Perry was a competent all-round historian, the Reformation period was that with which he was most familiar. The volume ranks among the best of the series. The same merits are found in his larger publication, <span class="italic">The Student's English Church History</span> (3 vols., 1878&#150;87). He also left two posthumous works. One was the <span class="italic">Diocesan History of Lincoln</span> for the series published by SPCK. This he took up after the death of Edmund Venables, and incorporated in it the work which Venables had done. It was not published until after his death, in 1897; but he lived just long enough to correct the final proofs. The other was the <span class="italic">Lives of the Bishops of Lincoln from Remigius to Wordsworth</span>, written in collaboration with J. H. Overton and finished by the latter for publication in 1900. Perry was also a contributor to periodical literature and to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. He died on 10 February 1897 in his rectory, and was buried in Waddington churchyard. A tablet to his memory in Waddington church and a window in the chapter house of Lincoln Cathedral were erected by public subscription.<br>
