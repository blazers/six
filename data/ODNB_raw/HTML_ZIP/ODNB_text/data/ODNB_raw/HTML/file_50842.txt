<span class="headword">Bottomore,  Thomas Burton</span>  (1920&#150;1992), <span class="occ">sociologist</span>, was born on 8 April 1920 at the Collins Trust Maternity Hospital, Waverley Street, Nottingham, the first of the three children of Thomas Joseph Bottomore (1887&#150;1954), milliner, and his wife, Margaret Amy (1894&#150;1977), daughter of James Ernest Bacon, draper, of Nottingham, and his wife, Margaret. Tom, as he was generally known, was educated at Nottingham high school, from 1930 to 1936, and the London School of Economics (LSE), where he graduated in 1943 with an upper second-class BSc (Econ), having worked from 1941 in the Ministry of Economic Warfare. From 1943 to 1947 he did military service, becoming captain and staff captain in the Sherwood Foresters and serving in India and Austria, where he worked in the economics division of the Allied Control Commission. In August 1947, in Vienna, he married Christiane (Christl) von Mosing, a writer and journalist. When he left the army he returned to the LSE, and was awarded his MSc (Econ) in 1950, with a thesis on &#145;Recent theories of social progress&#146;. In 1951&#150;2 he held a Rockefeller fellowship at the Sorbonne, where he conducted research on the French higher civil service as well as pursuing interests in Marxist theory and workers' co-operatives, and where he got to know many French intellectuals and acquired excellent French and lifelong friends. When he returned to Britain in 1952 he took up an assistant lectureship in sociology at the LSE, and was promoted to lecturer in 1955 and reader in 1959. Meanwhile, having separated from his first wife in 1950 and divorced her early in 1953, on 30 January 1953 he married Mary Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greasley (1918&#150;1986), who worked as a translator and for the Citizens' Advice Bureau. They had three children: Katherine Helen (<i>b</i>. 1954), Stephen (<i>b</i>. 1955), and Eleanor Jane (<i>b</i>. 1957).<br>
<br>Bottomore remained at the LSE until 1965, when he left for a professorship at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. He returned to Britain in 1967 to become the first professor of sociology at the still new University of Sussex, where he remained (apart from brief periods from 1974 to 1976 at Dalhousie University) until his formal retirement in 1985. In personal appearance he was slim, dark-haired, and of medium height, with a dignified yet quizzical expression, a moustache, a conventional tweed-jacketed style of dress, and a pipe often in his hand. In Sussex he lived at Cherry Tree Cottage, in the village of Ditchling, where he helped dig the swimming pool which he regularly used; he listed his recreations as riding, swimming, gardening, travel, reading, film, and theatre.<br>
<br>The International Sociological Association, founded in 1950, figured largely in Bottomore's life, and he played several important roles in it. In 1953 he became the third executive secretary of the fledgeling association, and held that post until 1959. From 1957 to 1962 he edited its journal <span class="italic">Current Sociology</span>, which had the important function of providing systematic bibliographical information on major fields of sociological work. From 1970 to 1974 he was vice-president with responsibility for its &#145;research committees&#146;, and from 1974 to 1978 president. (It was for an International Sociological Association commission that he wrote his textbook <span class="italic">Sociology</span>, published in 1962, designed to provide an introduction suitable for Indian students&#151;though it was widely used outside India.) He was also president of the British Sociological Association from 1969 to 1971; that position was mainly honorific.<br>
<br>As a young man, Bottomore had become interested in socialism as a potential remedy for the poverty he saw in Nottinghamshire mining communities and for the rise of fascism, and briefly became a member of the Communist Party. For the rest of his life he was politically committed to socialism, and strongly interested in Marxism, though he was no orthodox Marxist, and his political activity was mainly on the intellectual front. His time in Paris led to co-editorship with Maximilien Rubel of <span class="italic">Selected Writings on Sociology and Social Philosophy</span> by Marx (1956), which introduced many sociology students to Marx's thought. He wrote about Marx and Marxists, translated related works, and in 1983 published a <span class="italic">Dictionary of Marxist Thought</span>. These initially unfashionable interests were in tune with the times in the late 1960s and 1970s, and that did much to enhance his reputation. Other especially influential works, of a high intellectual standard though written for a student audience, were his <span class="italic">Classes in Modern Society</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Elites and Society</span> (1964). Although he drew on empirical work by others, after his time in Paris he was a theorist rather than a researcher. He continued to publish copiously until his death; his later books were largely historical or reference works. His writing was outstandingly clear and readable. He often played a mediating intellectual role, linking Marxism to other social theories and moderating criticisms of either from the other side. His interests and perspectives were always as much international as they were British, and his Marxism was a basis for connections crossing some of the usual boundaries.<br>
<br>Bottomore was widely respected among sociologists both in Britain and abroad. Numerous graduate students of his became prominent theorists themselves. Some of his closest intellectual relationships were reflected in his retirement Festschrift, <span class="italic">Social Theory and Social Criticism</span> (ed. W. Outhwaite and M. Mulkay, 1987) and in an interview that he gave to <span class="italic">Theory, Culture and Society</span> (vol. 6/3, 1989). He died at his home, Cherry Tree Cottage, from a sudden aneurysm on 9 December 1992, and was cremated at Woodvale crematorium, Brighton, on 12 December.<br>
