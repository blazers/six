<span class="headword">Shepard,  Thomas</span>  (1605&#150;1649), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was born on 5 November 1605 at Towcester, Northamptonshire, the youngest child of William Shepard (<i>d</i>. 1615), a grocer originally from the village of Fossecut, who married the daughter of a merchant, a Mr Bland, from whom he learned his trade. When Thomas was about four his mother died, and his father subsequently married a woman who would not accept the child his mother had described as &#145;her youngest and best beloved&#146;  (Albro, xiv). Following their father's death Shepard's elder brother John eventually took charge of him and saw to it that he continued to receive an education at the free school of Towcester, which prepared him for admittance as a pensioner to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 10 February 1620. Shepard graduated BA in 1624.<br>
<br>Both disease and debauchery are said to have played roles in Shepard's spiritual awakening. At Cambridge he attended the preaching of several notable churchmen, and speaks with anguish of his dissolute behaviour and a lack of belief that caused him to veer from the contemplation of suicide to religious fervour. Under the preaching of John Preston, then master of Emmanuel College, Shepard entered into a profound religious conversion which led him finally to resolve to enter the ministry. Shepard describes his experience of hearing Preston preach:<blockquote>the Lord so bored my ears as that I understood what he spake and the secrets of my soul were laid upon [i.e., open] before me&#151;the hypocrisy of all good things I thought I had in me&#151;as if one had told him of all that ever I did, of all the turnings and deceits of my heart, insomuch as that I thought he was the most searching preacher in the world. And I began to love him much and to bless God I did see my frame and my hypocrisy and self and secret sins, although I found a hard heart and could not be affected with them. (&#145;Autobiography&#146;, 44)</blockquote>Anguish, and vacillation between assurance of salvation and fear of damnation, characterize Shepard's writings not only from this period but throughout a life troubled at the prospect that his beliefs and actions might ultimately prove unacceptable to God. He longed to know for certain whether he had won the eternal lottery, and this insecurity fired a lifetime of popular preaching and writing:<blockquote>It is a thousand to one if ever thou be one of that small number whom God hath picked out to escape this wrath to come. If thou dost not get the Lord Jesus to bear this wrath, farewell God, Christ, and God's mercy forever. (&#145;The sincere convert&#146;, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.45)</blockquote>From his time as a student at Cambridge, Shepard also struggled with the conflicting creeds of Calvinism, Arminianism, and a form of antinomianism known contemporaneously as Grindletonianism because of its association with Roger Brereley, minister in Grindleton, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Probably at the suggestion of John Preston, Shepard left Cambridge in 1626 to enter the tutelage of Thomas Weld, the vicar at Terling, Essex. In a parochial apprenticeship characteristic of the development of godly ministry in the Jacobean period, he was given both pastoral formation and practical training, and was introduced to a network of potential mentors and colleagues. At Terling Shepard came under the influence of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13697/', "Thomas Hooker")</script>, then preaching at Chelmsford. Both Weld and Hooker eventually preceded Shepard in emigrating to North America. Shepard's years at Terling proved to be formative and eventful; during them his vocation and theological identity were shaped as a member of the relatively close-knit circle of Essex ministers, often with ties to Emmanuel College, whose nonconformist sympathies shared at least a spiritual affinity with the Elizabethan puritan movement.<br>
<br>Shepard proceeded MA in 1627, took deacon's orders at Peterborough on 12 July the same year, and was ordained priest the following day. After considerable deliberation with Weld, Hooker, and other godly ministers and leading lay persons, he accepted the invitation of the people of Earls Colne, near Coggeshall, Essex, to serve as their minister in a three-year lectureship endowed by a Dr Wilson and originally intended for the town of Coggeshall. He served at Earls Colne from 1627 to 1630, after which the people of the town pledged the sum of &pound;40 per year to underwrite his lectureship. The lecture provided by Dr Wilson was moved, in part because of Shepard's influence, to his home town of Towcester, where Samuel Stone, another graduate of Emmanuel College, took up the charge.<br>
<br>In the light of the affirmation of Earls Colne for his ministry, Shepard had determined to remain there. However, on 16 December 1630 he was summoned to London by Bishop William Laud, who silenced him and refused to allow him to exercise ministry in the diocese of London, according to Shepard, with the words, &#145;I will have no such fellows prate in my diocese&#146;  (&#145;Autobiography&#146;, 51n.). Ironically, according to Shepard, until he was accused of nonconformity he had not made up his mind concerning the subject. Returning to Earls Colne, however, although he submitted to the bishop's injunction against teaching, Shepard came to &#145;see the evil of the English ceremonies, cross, surplice, and kneeling&#146;  (ibid., 52). When he appeared again before Bishop Laud the bishop instructed him to leave Earls Colne altogether.<br>
<br>Shepard says in his autobiography that it was at this time that he and Weld began to consider going to New England. Before doing so they hoped to preach in Ireland and Scotland, but after a third encounter with Bishop Laud, Shepard took flight to Yorkshire, where he had been offered a position in a prominent household sympathetic to the plight of ejected godly ministers. He became the chaplain to the family of Sir Richard Darley in Buttercrambe, Yorkshire, where he met a cousin of Sir Richard, Margaret Touteville; they were married on 23 July 1632. Shortly thereafter Shepard received a call from a church in the Northumbrian town of Heddon, near Newcastle, but Bishop Thomas Morton of Durham, at the direction of Archbishop Richard Neile of York, refused him permission to preach publicly there. Nevertheless, Shepard explains that he &#145;preached up and down in the country&#146;, and in at least one private home, belonging to Mr Fenwick, until John Cotton, Thomas Hooker, Thomas Weld, and Samuel Stone emigrated from England  (&#145;Autobiography&#146;, 56&#150;7).<br>
<br>Under considerable official pressure, and without the support of these friends, Shepard decided also to sail for New England in October 1634. Following a failed Atlantic crossing, and (immediately after landfall) the death of their first child, Shepard and his wife remained in England for several more months, during which time a second child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25326/', "Thomas Shepard (1635&#150;1677)")</script>, was born. On 10 August 1635 they sailed again, arriving in New England on 3 October. Two days later Shepard and his travelling companions settled in the colonial village of Newtown. His wife soon died there of tuberculosis contracted on the journey.<br>
<br>Shepard made a significant contribution to the religious and educational life of the colonial settlement in Massachusetts. As minister of First Church, Newtown, perhaps in reaction to his own early temptations, he helped define puritan order and orthodoxy during the antinomian controversy of 1636&#150;8, which eventually resulted in the expulsion from the colony of Anne Hutchinson, John Wheelwright, and their followers, and in the chastening of Shepard's old colleague, John Cotton. In contrast to Hutchinson's view that assurance of one's salvation cannot be obtained by contemplating one's own progress in righteousness, but is granted to the believer directly by the Holy Spirit, Shepard held that &#145;God made room for man's own striving within the larger framework of the divine initiative. God and man worked together in the process of salvation&#146;  (Hall, 18). As he wrote to Cotton, one cannot separate God's revelation in the Word (the <span class="roman">Bible</span>) from God's revelation in the Holy Spirit. Shepard worked out these themes in a series of sermons preached between 1636 and 1640, posthumously published in 1660 as <span class="italic">The Parable of the Ten Virgins</span>. Although he might, like the saints, boast of hope in Christ, men should not &#145;sluggishly put all on Christ&#146;, while it is true, he asserts, that &#145;the mighty working of Christ that must conquer thy lusts; but must this put you to neglect striving?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.250&#150;51).<br>
<br>Shepard was also instrumental in founding Harvard College in 1636, at which time the name of Newtown was changed to Cambridge, and in establishing the colonial plan for Congregational church government, the <span class="italic">Cambridge Platform</span>, of 1647. In 1637 Shepard married Joanna, daughter of Thomas Hooker; together they had two sons, Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1639) and John (<i>b</i>. and <i>d</i>. 1646). Following Joanna's death in 1646, he married Margaret Boradel in 1647, with whom he had one son, Jeremiah, born in 1648. Shepard died in Cambridge on 25 August 1649 and was buried there; his third wife survived him. His influence on religious thought in the New World remained considerable, not least through the eighteenth-century colonial theologian, Jonathan Edwards.<br>
