<span class="headword">Wigan,  John</span>  (1696&#150;1739), <span class="occ">physician and author</span>, was born on 31 January 1696, the son of William Wigan, rector of Kensington, Middlesex. In 1710 he was admitted to Westminster School, and thence proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 15 June 1714. He graduated BA on 6 February 1719, MA on 22 March 1721, and MB and MD (6 July) in 1727. Some of his poems are included among those written at the time of Queen Anne's death in 1714, and also of Dr Radcliffe's death in the same year. Besides these, he wrote the lines on the death of Dean Aldrich which were published in Vincent Bourne's edition of the dean's poems; and at least four of the exercises in the <span class="italic">Carmina quadragesimalia</span> (vol. 1, 8, 57&#150;8, 62&#150;3, and 104&#150;5) are ascribed to him. On 5 October 1726 he was admitted principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford, and about the same time was appointed secretary to the earl of Arran, the chancellor of the university.<br>
<br>Wigan was admitted as a candidate at the Royal College of Physicians on 12 April 1731, and as a fellow on 3 April 1732, at which point he resigned his post at New Inn Hall and moved to Craig Court in London. He was elected physician to Westminster Hospital in 1733, a post he retained until 1737. In 1738 he travelled with his friend Edward Trelawny to Jamaica, acting as his physician and secretary. In Jamaica in 1739 Wigan married Mary Wheeler, daughter of John Douce, a planter on the island, and widow of Philip Wheeler of Jamaica, and they had one daughter, Mary Trelawny Wigan.<br>
<br>In his day Wigan was well known as a writer. As early as 1718 he published a translation of a work by Longinus on fever cures. He also produced a respected edition of Aretaeus, published in 1723. When Boerhaave published his edition of the same author in 1735, he referred heavily to Wigan's book, and included a grateful acknowledgement of Wigan's achievement. Wigan also produced a number of other translations and indexes. He died in Jamaica on 5 December 1739, aged forty-three. A black marble slab was laid as a memorial to him in the cathedral church of St Catherine, Spanish Town.<br>
