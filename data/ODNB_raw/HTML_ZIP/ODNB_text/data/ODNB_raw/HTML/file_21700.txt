<span class="headword">Pears, Sir  Thomas Townsend</span>  (1809&#150;1892), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, born on 9 May 1809, was the son of the Revd James Pears (1777/8&#150;1853), headmaster of Bath grammar school, and the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21699/', "Steuart Adolphus Pears")</script>. He went to Addiscombe College in 1823, was commissioned lieutenant in the Madras engineers on 17 June 1825, and, after the usual Chatham course, sailed for India in late 1826. He was employed in the public works department, and became a superintending engineer as early as 1828.<br>
<br>Invalided to England in 1834, Pears returned to India overland through Persia in 1836, and was appointed commandant of the Madras sappers and miners. He was promoted second captain on 15 September 1838. In 1839, while still commanding his corps, he was appointed chief engineer with the field force employed in Karnal. After this expedition, which resulted in the capture of the fort and town of Karnal, and of the nawab, Pears was dispatched as field engineer with the force in China, and took part in the capture of the island of Chushan in 1840.<br>
<br>In 1841 Pears was appointed commanding engineer with the army in China under Sir Hugh Gough, and greatly distinguished himself. In Gough's dispatch of 3 October 1841, reporting the capture of the city of Tinghai (Dinghai), he stated that &#145;the scaling-ladders had been brought up in most difficult and rugged heights by the great exertions of the Madras sappers, and were gallantly planted under the direction of Captain Pears, who was the first to ascend&#146;. After the capture of the fortified city and heights of Chapu (Zhapu), Pears was again mentioned for placing the powder bags which blew in the defences of a fort where a desperate resistance was offered. With the exception of the attack on Canton (Guangzhou) and the bombardment of Amoy (Xiamen), Pears was present as commanding engineer in every action of Gough's China campaign of 1841&#150;2. He was repeatedly mentioned in dispatches, and at the close of the war was made brevet major on 23 December 1842, and CB.<br>
<br>On Pears's return to Madras he was employed in the public works department, as superintending engineer at Nagpur, and in various other responsible situations, chiefly in the inception and development of the railway system. From 1851 to 1857 he was the consulting engineer for railways to the government of Madras. He was then appointed chief engineer in the public works department for Mysore, and was the trusted adviser of Sir Mark Cubbon. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 1 August 1854, and colonel in the army on 1 August 1857. He retired on a pension on 8 February 1861 with the honorary rank of major-general, but, on his arrival in England, was offered, unsolicited, the appointment of military secretary at the India Office in succession to Sir William Baker.<br>
<br>When Pears took office under Sir Charles Wood (afterwards Lord Halifax) the duties were formidable and delicate, following the military reorganization after the abolition of the East India Company. Vested interests, often extravagantly asserted, had to be defended against often unreasonable attacks. Pears gained the trust of the ministers under whom he served&#151;Sir Charles Wood, Sir Stafford Northcote, the duke of Argyll, and Lord Salisbury. The organization at home for the Abyssinian expedition of 1867 was entrusted to him, and Sir Stafford Northcote wrote to him expressing the highest appreciation. On 13 June 1871 he was appointed a civil KCB. He retired in 1877.<br>
<br>Pears had married, at Madras, on 31 December 1840, Bellina Marianne, daughter of Captain Charles Johnston of the Madras army. They had seven children, of whom six survived him. His eldest son, in the Bengal civil service, collector of Budaun, died at Allahabad in 1883. His second son, Major T. C. Pears, Bengal staff corps, became political agent at Alwar, Rajputana.<br>
<br>Pears's wife died at Putney on 17 January 1892. Pears died at his residence, Eton Lodge, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, on 7 October 1892, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.<br>
