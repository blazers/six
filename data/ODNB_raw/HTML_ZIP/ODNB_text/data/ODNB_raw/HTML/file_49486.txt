<span class="headword">Hooley,  Edgar Purnell</span>  (1860&#150;1942), <span class="occ">surveyor and road builder</span>, was born on 5 June 1860 at Brunswick Street, Swansea, the son of Charles Hooley, commercial traveller, and his wife, Elizabeth Phillips, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Purnell. Nothing is known about his education, but following a short period in the office of the surveyor to the Neath (south Wales) highway board, Hooley was articled in 1876 to James Craik, civil engineer and surveyor, Bristol. He spent a further year, 1879&#150;80, as an assistant, before returning to Neath, and entering a general partnership with Francis Lean. In 1881, he became surveyor to the Stow on the Wold highway board, and took a similar position with the rural sanitary authority for Maidstone in Kent, in 1884, where he was also responsible for the design of water and sewerage schemes, as well as for roads and bridges. In a tract published by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1892, <span class="italic">Sanitary Work in Rural Districts</span>, Hooley wrote of how outbreaks of disease caused by the poor drainage of such districts might excite less public interest, but proportionately they were just as commonplace as in urban areas.<br>
<br>Hooley was appointed surveyor and architect to the newly established Nottinghamshire county council in 1889. Together with his chief assistant, he designed and built between 1896 and 1902 the county asylum, at a cost of &pound;147,000. Drawing heavily on his experience at Maidstone, he put into effect a bookkeeping and contractual system for the maintenance of the county's main roads. An outline of the system, which he gave to the newly empowered district councils, was later published as a book, <span class="italic">Management of Highways</span> (1894). In 1902, Hooley took the further position of road engineer for the Kesteven county council of Lincolnshire. However, the work of the two counties, together with private practice, led to a breakdown in his health, and his resignation from the Kesteven position. He later served as acting county surveyor for Oxfordshire, and as consulting county surveyor for Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Hooley was keenly interested in the materials used in road construction and maintenance. During his time at Maidstone, he had substituted granite for local stone. Although more expensive to purchase, and import to the county, its hard-wearing qualities brought longer term savings. His priority in the early 1890s was to remedy damage wrought by earlier short-term economies. Roads had been &#145;starved&#146; of materials to the point where their foundations showed through. Again, there were significant, long-term savings to be made from large-scale and immediate expenditure. The increasing number of heavy traction engines placed further demands on road construction and maintenance. Even where the foundations were sound, and the traditional water-based macadam surface well maintained, the &#145;sucking-up&#146; action of the pneumatic tyres of the rapidly growing number of motor cars created a crisis in road management. Not only was there public outcry over the dust and mud nuisance, but the road surface disintegrated even more rapidly.<br>
<br>Convinced that the future lay with the car&#151;it made less dirt, and was quicker and more convenient than either the horse or traction engine&#151;Hooley saw no alternative but to design an entirely new road surface. There had been numerous trials with various forms of tarmacadam. Hooley is generally credited with being the first to discover ways of mixing tar with slag mechanically at the blast furnace in such a way as to produce an impervious and hard-wearing surfacing material. The re-formation of a 5 mile length of the Radcliffe Road, south of Nottingham, and its covering with tarmac, demonstrated what such investment could achieve in terms of a dust- and mud-free surface, that lasted considerably longer than conventional surfaces. Hooley obtained a patent in 1902, and registered a company to exploit it in June 1903. The venture was secured, however, only by the intervention of Sir Alfred Hickman MP (the owner of a blast furnace), who became chairman, in 1905, of the company which now called itself Tarmac.<br>
<br>Hooley was elected to the Incorporated Association of Municipal and County Engineers in 1884, was a contributor to its journal, and its president in 1908&#150;9. He was elected an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in December 1886, and member in January 1906. For many years, he was an outstanding figure as an expert witness in the committee room of the House of Commons, in the law courts, and at Local Government Board inquiries. He served as a member of the advisory committee of the roads board.<br>
<br>Hooley resigned as county surveyor in January 1915, after he had offered his professional services to the Sherwood Foresters. Never one to tolerate ill-informed criticism of his profession, Hooley was described as immensely popular with all who knew him. He died at home in Oxford, at Greyroofs, 16 Davenant Road, on 26 January 1942. He was survived by his wife, Matilda Fanny, two daughters, and two sons. He was cremated on 28 January 1942.<br>
