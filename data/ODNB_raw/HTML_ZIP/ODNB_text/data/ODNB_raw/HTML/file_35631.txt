<span class="headword">Pumphrey,  Richard Julius</span>  (1906&#150;1967), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born at 30 Wynnstay Gardens, Kensington, London, on 3 September 1906, the only child of Julius Pumphrey, a manufacturer of umbrellas, and his wife, Alice Lilian, the daughter of Edward Towgood of Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. His father came from a well-known Quaker family in Worcestershire; his mother had moved to Kent as a child. Pumphrey was educated at Arnold House School, London, and at Marlborough College (1920&#150;25). There H. L. O. Fletcher imbued him with an abiding interest in the English language, and the biologist A. G. Lowndes encouraged him to explore the Wiltshire countryside. Pumphrey won an entrance scholarship to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he took part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1927, gaining second-class honours. He went on to finish with first-class honours in part two in 1929 (in zoology and comparative anatomy) and was awarded the Frank Smart prize as the best zoologist of the year.<br>
<br>Pumphrey now began research in experimental cytology at Cambridge, working on the physical chemistry of the surface membranes of trout eggs. In 1931 he was appointed Amy Mary Preston Read scholar, and the following year he was awarded his PhD. In 1934 he was a Rockefeller fellow at the Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation at the University of Pennsylvania, where he gained experience in electrophysiology that set a pattern for his future work. He held a Beit fellowship in the University of Cambridge from 1936 to 1939. At Cambridge Pumphrey met Sylvia Margaret Mills, a research student in the department of zoology, and daughter of the chemist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35030/', "W. H. Mills (1873&#150;1959)")</script>; they were married at Chesterton, near Cambridge, in 1933. A daughter, Alison Margaret, and two sons, Nicholas and Richard, were born.<br>
<br>In October 1939 Pumphrey joined the Admiralty Surface Weapons Research Establishment at Ports Down, transferring in 1941 to the Admiralty Signal Establishment at Witley. There he became an important contributor to electronics and radar development, gaining admiration for both his hard work and ingenuity as an experimenter. He developed the accurate radar ranging apparatus, for which he was granted &pound;400 from the Admiralty Awards Council. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge, where he collaborated with Professor T. Gold on the biophysics of hearing, both in man and the higher vertebrates, and at the fourth symposium of the Society for Experimental Biology in 1949 (the year he was awarded the degree of ScD by the University of Cambridge) he presented one of the most definitive publications on the subject of hearing. Between 1947 and 1949 he was assistant director of research in zoology.<br>
<br>In 1949 Pumphrey was appointed Derby professor of zoology at the University of Liverpool, where he became recognized as a shrewd, wise defender of his department who acquired the best possible facilities for his staff and students. During his tenure he served terms as both dean and chairman of the faculty of science and was also active on national bodies (serving on the councils of both the Marine Biological Association and the Society for Experimental Biology). He was also recognized as a gifted lecturer who could explain a complicated subject with clarity; he was a master of the stimulating phrase and sentence.<br>
<br>Despite his teaching and administrative loads Pumphrey continued his own research into the sense organs and central nervous systems of animals. He greatly clarified knowledge of the intermediate zone between touch and hearing, and produced a theory of frequency modulation in the hearing and vision of birds and insects which explained the ability of grasshoppers and crickets to recognize the sounds of their own species. Much of this research was conducted on equipment which Pumphrey had constructed himself. (He later collaborated with A. F. Rawdon-Smith in the design of more advanced equipment which became widely used in electrophysiology.) Pumphrey extended his bird and insect studies much further by investigating human hearing and demonstrating the high sensitivity of resonant elements in the ear. His continuing study of vision resulted in an important article published in the Festschrift for Sir James Gay.<br>
<br>Pumphrey had been interested in languages since his Marlborough days and his inaugural lecture at Liverpool on &#145;The origin of language&#146; was published by the university press. His work was published in Norwegian, and through his love of Snowdon he also came to appreciate the Welsh language. In his university days he had been a formidable athlete, rowing in the Trinity Hall first boat and playing in the University of Cambridge hockey first eleven, and he never lost his love of country pursuits such as fishing and rock climbing. Pumphrey died following a short illness, at Clatterbridge Hospital, Bebington, on the Wirral, on 25 August 1967. He was survived by his wife.<br>
