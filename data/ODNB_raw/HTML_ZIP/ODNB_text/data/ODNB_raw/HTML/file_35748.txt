<span class="headword">Riddell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cowan]</span>,  Charlotte Eliza Lawson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>F. G. Trafford]</span>  (1832&#150;1906), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, born on 30 September 1832 at The Barn (or Barn Cottage), Carrickfergus, co. Antrim, was the daughter of James Cowan (<i>d</i>. 1851), flax and cotton spinner of Carrickfergus, and his second wife, Ellen Kilshaw (<i>d</i>. 1856). She had one full brother, and a half-brother and six half-sisters from her father's first marriage. From her childhood her father was an invalid. On his death much of his property went, by her marriage settlement, to the family of his first wife; his widow had an annuity of &pound;100 p.a. with which she and her daughter went to live on a small jointure at Dundonald, co. Down, the setting for Charlotte's novel <span class="italic">Berna Boyle</span> (1884). In 1855 they moved to London, where they knew no one, and Charlotte tried to earn money for herself and her dying mother by writing, an experience she described in <span class="italic">A Struggle for Fame</span> (1883). Her first book, written as R. V. Sparling, was <span class="italic">Zuriel's Grandchild</span> (1856). Its publisher, to whom she long remained grateful, was Thomas Cautley Newby, better known, and often reviled, as the publisher of the first novels of Emily Bront&euml; and Anthony Trollope. Her mother died on 16 December 1856 and did not profit from her daughter's first modest successes. As Rainey Hawthorne she published <span class="italic">The Ruling Passion</span> (1857), and as F. G. Trafford seven novels between 1858 and 1866. Of these the most successful, and indeed the most popular of all her many works, was <span class="italic">George Geith of Fen Court</span> (1864), a story of an unwittingly bigamous accountant&#151;one of the sensation novels then in vogue, for which William Tinsley paid her &pound;800, probably the best price she ever received. It went into several editions and was dramatized in 1883. Like many of her books, it is much preoccupied with the social status of the businessman. After 1866 all her novels appeared under the name Mrs J. H. Riddell, though many of her stories appeared anonymously in magazines.<br>
<br>On 24 September 1857 Charlotte Cowan married, at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, Joseph Hadley Riddell (<i>d</i>. 20 March 1881), described in the register as a patent agent; he (or possibly his father and namesake) applied for several patents between 1856 and 1869, mostly for improvements to boilers and hot-water pipes, calling himself variously &#145;civil engineer&#146;, &#145;hot water engineer&#146;, &#145;boiler manufacturer&#146;, and &#145;American stove merchant&#146;. The business was at 155 Cheapside, and it had collapsed by September 1871, when he petitioned the bankruptcy court for liquidation. The episode was acknowledged by his wife to have provided the background for her novel <span class="italic">Mortomley's Estate</span> (1874); it also left her with a husband (soon an invalid) to support and a burden of debt to discharge. The Riddells' financial problems may have antedated the actual bankruptcy. Charlotte Riddell's rate of production was high even in the 1860s, and she also edited for some time the <span class="italic">Home Magazine</span> (which ran from 1856 to 1866) and, from 1867, <span class="italic">St James's Magazine</span>, of which she was co-proprietor and in which her novel <span class="italic">A Life's Assize</span> ran from 1868 to 1870. But Harry Furniss recalled that she told him in 1873 that &#145;there is not a magazine in London paying, the libraries destroy the sale&#146;.<br>
<br>In Charlotte Riddell's day she was known best as a novelist of commercial life, and she told an interviewer that &#145;all the pathos of the City, the pathos in the lives of struggling men, entered into my soul, and I felt I must write, strongly as my publisher objected to my subject&#146;. However, her modern reputation rests on the revival of interest in her ghost stories (published in <span class="italic">Weird Stories</span>, 1882), largely owing to the work of E. F. Bleiler, who in 1977 collected and edited them as <span class="italic">Collected Ghost Stories</span>. The particular flavour of Riddell's writing comes from her atmospheric settings; the places she lived in&#151;Ireland and various parts of London, especially the City in which she spent her early married life&#151;are strongly evoked in various books. Further details are given by S. M. Ellis, who also records her many moves after 1870 around London's still semi-rural suburbs.<br>
<br>Much of Charlotte Riddell's work bears signs of hasty composition, for she was dogged by poverty. She was a friend of Dr George Harley (to whom she dedicated <span class="italic">The Nun's Curse</span>, 1888), whose daughter, the writer Ethel Tweedie, exerted herself to help Riddell in old age, obtaining grants for her from the Royal Literary Fund and the civil list, which, with some private donations, made up a pension fund administered by the Society of Authors; she was paid &pound;60 p.a. from 1901, the society's first pensioner. She died, childless, at her home, 12 Lampton Road, Hounslow, London, on 24 September 1906, of breast cancer which had been diagnosed in 1892, and she was buried in Heston churchyard, near Osterley, London.<br>
