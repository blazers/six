</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paolozzi, Sir  Eduardo Luigi</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">sculptor and printmaker</span>, was born on 7 March 1924 at 6 Crown Place, Leith, Edinburgh, the only son and elder child of Alfonso Rudolfo Armando Antonio Paolozzi (1901&#150;1940), confectioner, and his wife, Carmela Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rossi (1902&#150;1955), daughter of Pietro Rossi and his wife, Margherita Coletta. He was baptized at the Roman Catholic church of St Mary Star of the Sea, Leith, on 20 March.<h2>
<a name="Familyinternmentandartstudies"></a>Family, internment, and art studies</h2>Paolozzi's parents were born in Viticuso in the province of Frosinone, Italy, his mother's family emigrating to Scotland in the early years of the twentieth century, his father following in 1920, after service in the Italian army. In 1925 Paolozzi's father rented a confectionery shop at 10 Albert Street, off Leith Walk, and the family moved into the flat above it, where Paolozzi's sister Yolanda Margherita was born in 1932. Paolozzi attended Leith Walk primary school and Holy Cross Academy, Leith, and from the ages of nine to fifteen spent summers at the Italian youth camp, Colonia Marina XXVIII Ottobre a Cattolica. After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when Paolozzi was in his last year at school, his father tried to find him a position in an engineering works, but without success. When Italy declared war in June 1940 the family shop was one of several Italian shops looted by an angry mob. Paolozzi, his father, grandfather, and other male kin were arrested under the emergency powers of the <span class="roman">Enemy Aliens Act</span>, and interned in Saughton gaol, Edinburgh. His father and grandfather subsequently lost their lives with 800 other Italians and Germans when the <i>Arandora Star</i>, transporting them to Canada, was sunk by a German U-boat. On release from prison Paolozzi took casual jobs, but in October 1941 joined the general evening class at Edinburgh College of Art, an essentially craft-based course that included &#145;designs for all commercial purposes with special reference to the processes of reproduction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh College of Art Prospectus, 1940&#150;1941</span>, 55). He initially envisaged a career in commercial art, but his ambitions changed on transferring to the full-time course.<br>
<br>In June 1943 Paolozzi's art training was interrupted by service in the pioneer corps, during which he discovered a copy of Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Ozenfant's book, <span class="italic">Foundations of Modern Art</span> (1931), the modernist spirit of which remained a lifelong inspiration. On leave in London in 1943 he met his future wife, Freda Madge Elliott (<i>b</i>. 1925), the daughter of Ernest George Elliott, journeyman tiler. After fifteen months' service he successfully convinced an army medical board that he was mad by invoking the spirit of Donatello. His discharge enabled him to study at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, Oxford, in October 1944, but within a year he knew he &#145;wanted to make things&#146;  (interview, BL NSA), so in 1945 he transferred to the Slade School of Fine Art, London, to study sculpture, and lived in the Slade hostel in Cartwright Gardens. At the Slade Paolozzi's friends included William Chattaway, Richard Hamilton, Nigel Henderson, Raymond Mason, and William Turnbull. Like them Paolozzi enthusiastically embraced European modernism, especially the art of Picasso and the surrealists, developments disapproved of by his teachers, including the Slade sculpture master, A. H. Gerrard, with whom Paolozzi clashed. Paolozzi's first sculptures, two casts, <span class="italic">Horse's Head</span> and <span class="italic">Fisherman</span>, were roughly modelled in red, white, and blue concrete respectively, and exhibited with similarly Picasso-inspired ink and collage drawings of Newhaven fishing subjects, at the Mayor Gallery early in 1947, and praised by Robert Melville in <span class="italic">Horizon</span>.<br>
<br>The success of his first sculptures persuaded Paolozzi to abandon his Slade diploma, and in June he left for Paris, living there for the next two years, first in an attic room in the rue Bud&eacute; on the &Icirc;le St Louis, previously occupied by Raymond Mason, where Freda Elliott joined him, and then in a <i>chambre de bonne</i> where they lived on the rue de Chanaleilles. He worked in a studio on the rue Visconti belonging to the artist Gr&eacute;goire Michonze, and mixed with British and American artists and writers, including Peter Rose-Pulham (who encouraged him to meet Francis Bacon, of whose art he became a lifelong admirer), Saul Bellow, Stanley Geist, and Jesse Reichek. He exhibited twice with the international artists' group known as &#145;Les mains &eacute;blouies&#146; at the Galerie Maeght, Paris, and had two further one-man shows at the Mayor Gallery, one of Paris fair and lottery drawings (1948), and a second which included bas-relief sculptures (1949). He met, among others, Arp, Braque, Brancusi, Dubuffet, H&eacute;lion, L&eacute;ger, and Tristan Tzara, but the artist who impressed him most in Paris was Giacometti.<h2>
<a name="Redefiningsculpture"></a>Redefining sculpture</h2>When Paolozzi returned to London as instructor in textile design at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1949 the sculpture he brought back included &#145;Forms on a Bow&#146; in plaster, which the Contemporary Art Society commissioned in bronze for the Tate Gallery. Giacometti's surrealism of the 1930s also influenced other sculpture Paolozzi made in 1951 such as <span class="italic">Cage</span>, commissioned by the Arts Council, <span class="italic">Fountain</span>, designed for the Festival of Britain, and his short-listed entry for the Unknown Political Prisoner international sculpture competition (1952&#150;3). On his return to London he lived briefly with Lucian Freud and the Hendersons in Chisenhale Road, while working in a studio in Bunsen Street, before moving into a flat in Holland Road. On 7 July 1951 Paolozzi and Freda Elliott married at Kensington register office. They set up home in a flat in Kathleen Raine's house in Paultons Square, Chelsea. With the birth of their first daughter in 1954 the Paolozzis moved to Gull Cottage, Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, which remained the family home until 1988, and where their second and third daughters were born in 1957 and 1960.<br>
<br>At the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), early in 1952, Paolozzi gave a lecture illustrated with his own collages, magazine advertisements, and images from the cinema and science fiction, but for which he provided little or no commentary. Their sources were almost entirely American. The audience included the artists Richard Hamilton and Nigel Henderson, and the critics Lawrence Alloway and Reyner Banham, who with Paolozzi and others became founder members of the Independent Group later that year. The images themselves were overlooked until 1972, when they were published as facsimile prints entitled <span class="italic">Bunk!</span>, and Paolozzi was recognized as a formative influence on pop art. Also in 1952 Paolozzi exhibited three sculptures and three drawings at the Venice Biennale. The following year he was awarded the British critics' prize. In 1953 he collaborated with his fellow Independent Group members Nigel Henderson, the architects Peter and Alison Smithson, and the engineer Ronald Jenkins, on &#145;Parallel of Life and Art&#146;, an exhibition at the ICA that used photography to examine visual relationships between art and science in the modern world. In 1954 he created Hammer Prints with Henderson, to supply the trade with original designs for ceramics, textiles, and other domestic products. In 1955 he played the part of the deaf mute in the film <span class="italic">Together</span> (directed by Lorenza Mazzetti) alongside the artist Michael Andrews. In 1956 Paolozzi worked again with Henderson and the Smithsons on another exhibition, &#145;This Is Tomorrow&#146;, at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. Their <span class="italic">Patio and Pavilion</span>, which consisted of an ordinary lean-to garden shed, expressed the &#145;fundamental necessities of the human habitation&#146;, and was &#145;furnished with symbols for all human needs&#146;, including a bicycle wheel and other odds and ends. In 1956 Paolozzi received a William and Noma Copley Foundation award.<br>
<br>Between 1955 and 1956 Paolozzi taught sculpture at St Martin's School of Art, and afterwards developed a process of making sculpture which he called &#145;the metamorphosis of rubbish&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 May 1958). It involved pressing obsolete found objects in plaster, and casting the impressions in wax sheets, from which heads and figures were assembled for recasting in bronze. The resulting sculptures, some larger than life, have a distinctly mechanized look, and others, with such titles as <span class="italic">Icarus</span> and <span class="italic">St Sebastian</span>, ironically assume a mythological or religious identity. In an interview in 1959 Paolozzi said he was interested, &#145;above all, in investigating the golden ability of the artist to achieve a metamorphosis of quite ordinary things into something wonderful and extraordinary that is neither nonsensical nor morally edifying&#146;  (Roditi, 160). The new sculpture was shown in London at the Hanover Gallery (1958), and in &#145;New Images of Man&#146; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1959), as well as at the Venice Biennale (1960), by which time the British Council and the New York dealer Betty Parsons were promoting Paolozzi's sculpture abroad. The robotic pathos of the sculpture was often seen as a commentary on the uncertainties of the cold war, and from this period dates Paolozzi's international reputation; he won the David E. Bright Foundation award for best sculptor under forty-five, in New York (1960) and the Watson F. Blair prize in Chicago (1961). In 1960 he met the heiress Gabrielle Keiller who acquired a large collection of his work, some of which is now in the Dean Gallery, Edinburgh, together with examples from her collection of surrealist art, which Paolozzi helped form.<br>
<br>In 1960 Paolozzi bought a studio in Dovehouse Street, Chelsea, later acquiring three more adjacent studios, where he worked for the rest of his life. In 1960&#150;62 he taught a course he called &#145;The translation of experience&#146; at the Hochschule f&uuml;r Bildende K&uuml;nste in Hamburg, which was based on surrealist methods and made extensive use of James Joyce's <span class="italic">Finnegans Wake</span>. In 1961 he began to make more abstract sculpture referenced by, among others, German architecture and expressionist cinema. He welded it from pre-fabricated aluminium units on the shop floor of an engineering works, a process based on the aesthetic pioneered by the American sculptor David Smith, which was illustrated in Paolozzi's two books <span class="italic">Metafisikal Translations</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">The Metallization of a Dream</span> (1963). With his machine-age sculptures Paolozzi captured the mood of post-war Germany, and the collages he made in Hamburg for the film <span class="italic">The History of Nothing</span> (1962) poetically evoked its pre-war past. In 1964&#150;5 he made <span class="roman">As Is When</span>, a set of ten screen prints based on the life and philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, with whose love of &#145;low&#146; culture and unhappy experience of living in a foreign land Paolozzi identified. Part figurative, part abstract, <span class="roman">As Is When</span> was a milestone in the history of screenprinting, and questioned the limits of visual language to describe things and ideas. Meanwhile Paolozzi's sculpture, which in 1964 he began to paint with bright colours to resemble his prints, questioned the necessity of the third dimension to represent solid form. In 1964 Paolozzi's &#145;Wittgenstein&#146; prints and sculpture were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the following year he told Richard Hamilton, &#145;Some people need, perhaps, [the American art critic Clement] Greenberg, I need Wittgenstein&#146;  (Spencer, <span class="italic">Writings and Interviews</span>, 128). In 1967 he won the purchase prize for international sculpture at the Solomon Guggenheim Museum, New York, and first prize for sculpture at the Carnegie International Exhibition, Pittsburgh.<br>
<br>In 1968 Paolozzi was made a CBE, and became tutor in ceramics at the Royal College of Art, a post he held until 1989. In the late 1960s he assembled elaborate novels from &#145;cut-up&#146; texts in the manner of Raymond Roussel and William Burroughs, but only the briefer <span class="italic">Kex</span> (1966) and <span class="italic">Abba Zaba</span> (1970) were published as books. In 1969 he published a chapter of his illustrated anti-war novel <span class="italic">Why We Are in Vietnam</span> in the magazine <span class="italic">Ambit</span>, of which, with the novelist J. G. Ballard, he was contributing editor. Although a regular visitor to America, including California, where he was visiting lecturer at Berkeley in 1968, Paolozzi became increasingly disillusioned with the &#145;American dream&#146;, which he parodied in a pop idiom in two sets of prints, <span class="roman">Moonstrips Empire News</span> (1967) and <span class="roman">General Dynamic F.U.N.</span> (1970), the second with an introduction by Ballard. In 1969 he visited Japan to make the sculpture <span class="italic">Osaka Steel</span> for the World Expo, Osaka (1970). In 1970 he supplied designs for Lanvin's spring collections in Paris. In his one-man exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1971 Paolozzi criticized the links between Vietnam, big business, and the art world: the cover of the catalogue illustrated an American soldier's boot, and a gold ingot was reproduced on the back.<br>
<br>In the 1970s Paolozzi's graphics substituted Mickey Mouse for an abstract language that was distinctly European. In his sculpture he worked mainly in relief. In 1972 he was commissioned by the architect Michael Spens to design tapestries and nine ceiling panels for Cleish Castle in Scotland (now in the Dean Gallery, Edinburgh), which led to the commission from Glasgow University for aluminium doors for Whitfield Partners' new Hunterian Art Gallery (installed in 1980 but later unsympathetically rehung). In 1972 he was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy, and gave part of his collection of popular culture, &#145;The Krazy Kat Arkive&#146;, to St Andrews University for research (now in the archive of art and design, V&amp;A). In 1974 he began a lifelong association with the model maker Ray Watson as his principal assistant. In 1974&#150;5 he worked as guest of the German academic exchange service in Berlin, where retrospective exhibitions of his art were held at the Nationalgalerie, and Kupferstichkabinett. The abstract language of his reliefs, which evoked the Bauhaus, was developed synaesthetically in <span class="roman">Calcium Night Light</span> (1974&#150;7), a suite of nine prints dedicated to the American modernist composer Charles Ives. In the later 1970s Paolozzi was briefly represented by the Marlborough Gallery, London. Between 1977 and 1980 he was professor of ceramics at Fachhochschule, Fachbereich Kunst und Design, Cologne. In 1977 a large cast-iron sculpture <span class="italic">Hommage &agrave; Anton Bruckner</span> was commissioned for the grounds of the Brucknerhaus, Linz, and in 1978 a similar outdoor sculpture <span class="italic">Camera</span> was made for the European Patent Office, Munich.<h2>
<a name="Lateworkandpublicrecognition"></a>Late work and public recognition</h2>In 1980 Paolozzi won first prize in a competition to redevelop the banks of the Rhine in Cologne, and by 1986 twenty-seven of his bronze sculptures were installed in conjunction with stones and water. Between 1980 and 1986 he also designed the mosaic decorations for Tottenham Court Road underground station, and made the sculpture <span class="italic">Piscator</span> outside Euston Station, London. By this time Paolozzi began to speak of such public works as &#145;social sculpture&#146;, and of &#145;placing objects in a culture, not to present objects as culture&#146;  (private information). He was professor of master class at the Internationale Sommerakademie f&uuml;r Bildende Kunst, Salzburg (1981&#150;2), and in 1981 appointed professor of sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste, Munich, a post he held until retiring in 1991. In Munich he made a close study of the antique sculpture in the Glyptothek, which led to a return to the figure in his art, and arranged for his students to draw in the museum when the building was closed. In 1982 he received further commissions for public sculpture in Germany, and was also consultant for Richard Rogers and Partners' unsuccessful competition entry for the National Gallery extension, London. In 1983 he received the grand prix d'honneur at the Fifteenth International Print Biennale, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.<br>
<br>By the mid-1980s Paolozzi's fragmented imagery began to reflect the ecological and global issues that were of increasing concern to him. In 1984 he exhibited cut and fractured heads, the fruits of his Munich studies, in his large exhibition &#145;Recurring themes&#146;, at the Edinburgh International Festival. In the early 1980s he selected material from the collections of the Museum of Mankind of the British Museum, to explore post-modern attitudes to Africa and third-world cultures, for his exhibition &#145;Lost magic kingdoms and six paper moons&#146;, which toured widely in England and Wales between 1985 and 1989. In 1984&#150;5 he designed the sets for Percy Adlon's film <span class="italic">Herschel und die Musik der Sterne</span>, and played the part of the archbishop. In 1986 his sculpture <span class="italic">For Leonardo</span> was installed outside the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the large relief <span class="italic">On This Island</span> in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London.<br>
<br>In 1986 Paolozzi was appointed her majesty's sculptor in ordinary for Scotland. The National Portrait Gallery appointed him a trustee in 1988, and in the new year honours of 1989 he was knighted. In 1991 he was presented with the Goethe medal in Frankfurt. He was also a Royal Academician (1979); honorary member of the Architectural Association (1981); honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy (1987); visiting professor, Royal College of Art (1989); corresponding member of the Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste, Munich (1990); cavaliere officiale, ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana (1991); honorary professor of the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste, Munich (1991); honorary fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (1991); and the holder of nine honorary degrees and fellowships from British universities.<br>
<br>In 1991 <span class="italic">The Manuscript of Monte Cassino</span>, a large three-part bronze sculpture to commemorate the Italian community in Scotland, was unveiled outside St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh. In 1992 a twelve-foot high bronze version of &#145;Newton after Blake&#146; was commissioned for the courtyard of the new British Library, and unveiled by Cherie Booth (wife of the prime minister, Tony Blair) in 1997. In 1993 the queen unveiled <span class="italic">The Wealth of Nations</span>, in front of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Edinburgh. In 1995 he gave a large collection of his work to the National Galleries of Scotland, for exhibition in the Dean Gallery, which opened in 1999. Included in the permanent displays are Paolozzi's <span class="italic">Vulcan</span>, a 27 foot tall stainless steel figure, and a reconstruction of his studio. In the late summer of 2000, shortly after completing a suite of prints about the cryptologist Alan Turing, he collapsed in his London studio. Although in intensive care and not expected to survive, he made a partial recovery, and visited Edinburgh in October 2002 for the inauguration of his three stained glass <span class="roman">Millennium Windows</span> in St Mary's Cathedral, and again in 2004 for a party in honour of his eightieth birthday. He remained in care in a London nursing home until his death from a pulmonary embolism at the Hammersmith Hospital on 22 April 2005. He was cremated on 13 May at West London crematorium, Kensal Green, and was survived by his three daughters (his marriage having ended in divorce in 1988).<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>The recurring subject of Paolozzi's art was the relationship between man and machine, and the role of artificial intelligence in the post-industrial age. He also made several animated films on related themes and was a prolific writer of novels and poetry. His innovatory sculptural language was based on the cut, a process derived from making collage, which became his signature style. His role as an initiator of avant-garde exhibitions, and the ideas behind his Wittgenstein sculpture and prints, were of significance for concept-based art movements. His art became part of the postmodern urban landscape of Europe, when the influence of American art and theory declined, and narrative and decoration were no longer considered incompatible with the modernist spirit of art and architecture. He once said that artists, like the early Italians and Russians, &#145;should be able to embrace rather complex and broad-ranging content, from designing a pullover to painting their mother, and all in one week&#146;  (&#145;Conversations&#146;, 5).<br>
<br>From his teenage experience in Scotland, of cigarette cards and the cinema, Paolozzi believed that popular culture (the dynamism of which is present in his best work) was innately superior to much fine art, a belief he still upheld in the salons of Hampstead when he was a Royal Academician and the holder of several honorary degrees. Herein lies the paradox of Paolozzi's humble beginnings and his later social and professional life, as well as his equivocal attitude to the intensely capitalized commodity known as pop art, of which he was unquestionably a founding father, but about which he felt uncomfortable, saying: &#145;I don't want to go down in history as a pop artist. I would much rather go down, perhaps [as] an observer about something, [which] I would have thought, had much deeper European roots&#146;  (interview, BL NSA). To remain independent of the reductive fashions of the art market, and to make only what he wanted to, he avoided dealers; his few involvements with them were brief and generally unproductive. To compensate he assiduously cultivated social contacts, and from an early period was familiar with architects and architectural practice, knowledge which was useful when he made models and entered competitions. He also controlled his work by publishing his prints and sculpture in unique or very small editions, often with different colourways or minor variations, thus bringing an innovative approach to the reproductive conventions of graphics and sculpture.<br>
<br>Paolozzi's generosity was legendary, and he gave his work away liberally, to both friends and institutions. But his psychology was complex, and he could manipulate people as skilfully as he did objects. He was an amusing and challenging conversationalist, and loved the theatre as well as the cinema, but music moved him most as a spur to creativity. He remained an art school teacher all his life, his longest attachment being to the Royal College of Art, where he channelled the fees he received from Wedgwood and Rosenthal for his stylish designs into student scholarships. Of Paolozzi's legacy his friend the novelist J. G. Ballard said: &#145;if the entire twentieth century were to vanish in some huge calamity, it would be possible to reconstitute a large part of it from Paolozzi's sculpture and screenprints&#146;  (Grigor and Grigor). He left behind a vast archive of work in progress, comprising valuable ephemeral material collected over a lifetime, which will remain an important tool for art and cultural historians of the twentieth century for generations to come.<br>
