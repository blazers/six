<span class="headword">Cornwell,  James</span>  (1812&#150;1902), <span class="occ">educational writer</span>, born in east London on 4 August 1812, was one of nine children of James Cornwell, silk manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Blake. Up to the age of fifteen he was mainly self-taught. He then studied at the model school of the Borough Road Training College of the British and Foreign School Society, and by August 1829 was a fully-fledged student. In the early part of 1830 he was sent as a teacher on supply to the society's schools at Brighton and Chelmsford, and in October to Lindfield in Sussex. He returned to the college in January 1833 for a short period of training.<br>
<br>In April 1835 the society appointed Cornwell organizer of country schools, his duty being to &#145;organize new schools&#146; and assist newly appointed masters in obtaining &#145;good discipline by moral means&#146;. In October 1839 he was appointed normal schoolteacher and inspector, and from 1835 worked both in the training college and as an inspector outside. In 1846, when the training department of the institution in Borough Road was recognized by the privy council as a grant-earning normal college, Cornwell was appointed by the British and Foreign School Society its head teacher or principal. Under his care the institution greatly developed and took a high position among the training colleges of the country. His lectures were clear, pertinent, and accurate, and he showed much ability in practical teaching. His principles and methods of school management anticipated later developments.<br>
<br>Cornwell married on 19 November 1840 Mary Ann Wilson of Besthorpe, Nottinghamshire; they had one daughter. He continued his own studies, obtaining an external degree from London University and in 1847 he received a PhD from a German university. In 1860 he became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>In 1841 Cornwell began to publish school books, which enjoyed a universal vogue. With J. T. Crossley, J. G. Fitch, and Henry Dunn, he established the standard type of secular school book which came into general use in the second half of the nineteenth century. His first, <span class="italic">A New English Grammar</span> (1841), produced in collaboration with Dr Alexander Allen, had reached a twenty-third edition by 1855, and their <span class="italic">Grammar for Beginners</span> (1855) went through ninety editions. He collaborated with Fitch in publishing <span class="italic">The Science of Arithmetic</span> (1855). His <span class="italic">School Geography</span> (1847; 90th edn, 1904) had an enormous sale, though its relentless presentation of facts about the countries of the world, which were to be committed to memory, made it a rather unattractive volume.<br>
<br>Cornwell resigned from the principalship of Borough Road College at a comparatively young age in 1856, and lived in semi-retirement for nearly half a century, writing new works or revising his former ones for the series of school books entitled <span class="roman">Dr Cornwell's Educational Series</span>. He was fond of music and the study of nature. For sixteen years he lived at a house he built for himself, Loughborough Park Villa, Brixton, before moving to Purbrook, Crescent Wood Road, Sydenham, where he died on 12 December 1902. He was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
