<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Killigrew,  Thomas</span>  (1612&#150;1683), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre manager</span>, was born on 7 February 1612 at Lothbury, London, and baptized on 20 February at St Margaret, Lothbury, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15537/', "Sir Robert Killigrew (1579/80&#150;1633)")</script> and Mary Woodhouse; he was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15541/', "Sir William Killigrew")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15534/', "Henry Killigrew")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears16121641"></a>Early years, 1612&#150;1641</h2>Although the seat of the family estate was at Hanworth, near Hampton Court, Killigrew was probably raised in London. His interest in the drama may have been aroused at an early age: in October 1662 Pepys reported the story of how Killigrew as a boy would go to the Red Bull playhouse at Clerkenwell, &#145;and when the man cried to the boys, &#147;Who will go and be a divell, and he shall see the play for nothing?&#148;&#151;then would he go in and be a devil upon the stage&#146;  (Pepys, 3.243&#150;4). The earliest mention of Thomas occurs in his grandmother Margerie Killigrew's will, dated 22 May 1623: to him and his brothers Charles (1609&#150;1629), Robert (1611&#150;1635), and Henry (1613&#150;1700), she bequeathed the sum of &pound;5  (Margerie Killigrew's will).<br>
<br>Unlike that of his brothers William (1606&#150;1695) and Henry, who both studied at Oxford, Thomas's formal education appears to have been rather incidental. Correct spelling was an achievement that, even in later life, he never quite attained. As his brother Henry, in a letter to Anthony Wood, testified in November 1691, Thomas &#145;wanted some learning to poise his excellent natural wit&#146;  (Pritchard, 288). What education he had he obtained at court, to which his father, the queen's vice-chamberlain, must have introduced him. Contrary to what has been maintained, however, Thomas did not become a page at court as early as 1625 but some time later. Of his career at court until 1635 or 1636, not much is known. It has been (somewhat implausibly) suggested, on the authority of William Coventry's story as reported by Pepys in July 1665, that Thomas entered the service of Francis, Lord Cottington, when the latter became ambassador to Spain in the autumn of 1629  (Pepys, 9.256).<br>
<br>By July 1632 at the latest Killigrew was serving as a page of honour to Charles I, and over the next few years he tried to supplement his annual salary of &pound;100 with the proceeds from confiscated properties. In his will, dated 12 September 1632, Sir Robert bequeathed to his sons Thomas and Robert his part and portion of all his real estate in the county of Cornwall and &#145;the yearlie sum of fiftie pounds apeece &hellip; to be issuing and going out of all my Manors, lands, tenements and hereditaments&#146; in the same county  (Sir Robert Killigrew's will). To Thomas and his heirs he also left 100 acres of fenland in Lincolnshire. But Sir Robert's heavily encumbered bequest was probably an insufficient financial basis for a young courtier to build a career on. In the scramble for money and favour characteristic of one in his position, Thomas managed to ingratiate himself with Queen Henrietta Maria herself. His first play, <span class="italic">The Prisoners</span>, a romantic tragicomedy composed in 1635 and performed at the Phoenix, Drury Lane, by Her Majesty's Servants in 1636, may have been a successful bid for royal favour. In October 1635 he was given the opportunity to accompany Walter Montague, the queen's favourite, on his travels to the continent. Montague and his attendants stayed at Calais, Paris, Tours, Orl&eacute;ans, and Loudun, where Killigrew recorded his experiences at the convent of the possessed Ursuline nuns. Before 17 January 1636 they arrived at Vercelli in Italy, then continued south to Rome and Naples, where Killigrew's next two tragicomedies, <span class="italic">Claricilla</span> and <span class="italic">The Princess</span>, were composed, in whole or in part. <span class="italic">Claricilla</span> was performed at the Phoenix before 1641; <span class="italic">The Princess</span> was probably acted at Blackfriars by the King's Men.<br>
<br>In the spring Killigrew returned to England and on 29 June he married Cecilia Crofts, a maid of honour to the queen. Thomas Carew, a friend of the Crofts family, celebrated the bride's beauty and the groom's happiness in a poem &#145;On the Marriage of T. K. and C. C. the Morning Stormie&#146;. Henry, the single son from this wedding, was born on Easter day, 9 April 1637. Cecilia died on 1 January 1638 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. In Van Dyck's famous double portrait of <span class="italic">Killigrew and an Unknown Man</span>, painted in 1638, Killigrew is shown in mourning for Cecilia, wearing her wedding-ring and a small cross with her intertwined initials. The evidence shows that her memory stayed with him throughout the years of his second marriage.<br>
<br>In the course of 1639 Killigrew set off on his travels again. The sons of the earl of Cork, Francis (who married Thomas's sister Elizabeth in October 1639) and Robert Boyle, recorded meeting him in Paris in November. From their correspondence, Killigrew's itinerary can be accurately reconstructed: in March 1640 he joined them in Geneva and left for Basel three weeks later, intending to cross the Alps. He visited the English College of the Jesuits at Rome twice in March 1641 and on his way back to England stopped at Geneva again in April. The title-page of the 1664 folio edition of Killigrew's best-known play, <span class="italic">The Parson's Wedding</span>, probably written in 1640&#150;41, describes it as having been composed at Basel. Characterized by the Boyles' tutor as one that loved &#145;profaine and irreligious discourses&#146;  (Stoye, 247), Killigrew had somehow acquired the ill fame that was to haunt him ever after.<h2>
<a name="Exile16411660"></a>Exile, 1641&#150;1660</h2>Like most of his relatives, Killigrew joined the royalist side at the outbreak of the civil war. Already in November 1641 he had been employed as a messenger by both the king and the queen. He was summoned to appear before the Commons in February 1642 on suspicion of treason, but not until several months later was he taken into custody and probably placed under house arrest. He continued to occupy his lodgings at The Piazza, Covent Garden, until July 1643, when he was given a pass to join the royalist forces at Oxford. Soon afterwards he may have left England. By April 1647 he had become admitted to the circle of the exiled Prince Charles and was sent to Italy to borrow money for the support of his young master's cause, a mission that proved a moderate success. Killigrew's romantic tragedy <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span> may have been written for the Prince of Wales's Company in Paris in 1646. When James, duke of York, established himself at The Hague in May 1648, Killigrew entered his service as groom of the bedchamber. Shortly after the execution of Charles I in 1649, he transferred his services again to the household of Prince Charles in Paris. As the new king's special envoy, he was entrusted with the task of seeking the recognition of Venice and the northern states of Italy. In November 1649 he scored some success at Turin, then travelled on to Genoa, Leghorn, Pisa, and Florence, where the reception given him was much cooler and the authorities' attitude to the king's cause noncommittal.<br>
<br>Killigrew reached Venice on 14 February 1650 and remained there as Charles's resident for more than two years. During his Italian stay, he found the time to write two lengthy dramatic romances, <span class="italic">Cecilia and Clorinda</span>, its first part composed in Turin, its second in Florence, and <span class="italic">Bellamira her Dream</span>, entirely written in Venice. As of June 1651 Killigrew began to experience difficulties in his relationship with the Venetian senate over his alleged involvement in illegal slaughtering and smuggling practices. The senate's request in June 1652 that the English resident be dismissed was largely inspired by political expediency, as the Venetian republic did not wish to antagonize Cromwell's government.<br>
<br>After leaving Venice, Killigrew stayed briefly at The Hague in attendance on the duke of Gloucester. When the duke removed his household to Paris in May 1653, to join his mother and King Charles, Killigrew accompanied him there. Whether <span class="italic">Thomaso, or, The Wanderer</span>, probably completed in 1654, was written in Madrid, as the title-page of the 1664 edition indicates, has never been ascertained. Largely autobiographical, Killigrew's two-part comedy is a verbose but often sparkling account of the exiled cavaliers' experiences in Spain, France, and the Low Countries. Soon after the court had departed from Paris in June 1654, Killigrew returned to The Hague, home to a large English community. At The Hague, he enjoyed the protection of Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, who had been in exile there since 1621. To her intercession with Charles II, her nephew, and to the latter's mediation with Willem Frederik of Nassau-Dietz (1613&#150;1664), stadholder of Friesland, Killigrew owed his appointment, in 1655, as a captain in the service of the states general.<br>
<br>It was possibly on the occasion of his first visit to The Hague in summer 1652 that Killigrew had made the acquaintance of Charlotte van Hesse-Piershil (1629&#150;1715), the eldest and well-to-do daughter of Johan van Hesse (<i>d</i>. 1638), gentleman of the prince of Orange. The couple were married in the church of the Walloon Reformed Community, on 28 January 1655. As early as October 1655 the newly-weds contemplated leaving the city, signalling their intention to move to Maastricht, where Killigrew's company was garrisoned. On 29 December 1655, their first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15532/', "Charles Killigrew")</script>, the future theatre manager, was born there; and on 19 February 1657 a second son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 3 June 1674), was added to the family. In the meantime, Killigrew had himself assigned to a different company, no doubt within the same city. On 1 May 1656, the council of state, in view of Killigrew's reputation as someone having &#145;courage and experience in matters of war&#146;  (Vander Motten, &#145;Lost Years&#146;, 321), appointed him to replace one John More, who had deserted his company.<br>
<br>While in the pay of the states of Friesland, Killigrew also acted as a kind of liaison officer for Charles II. In a letter from Maastricht (intercepted by the intelligence services of John Thurloe, Cromwell's secretary of state), he provided an astute summary of the doings of the major European powers in spring 1657. The English government went on to monitor closely his movements in Charles's service. On 5 April 1658 Sir George Downing informed Thurloe of Killigrew's intention to seek the appointment to a vacant post of regimental major. The prospect of such promotion may have necessitated the family's temporary return to The Hague, for on 28 March 1658 the church register of the Walloon Reformed Community there recorded the christening of a daughter, Charlotte-Marguerite (who may have died in infancy, before the end of 1660).<br>
<br>As groom of the bedchamber, Killigrew accompanied Charles on his semi-secret tour of the United Provinces in early September 1658, a tour which probably took the king as far north as Friesland, where he visited the Frisian stadholder. On 18 October Downing reported to Thurloe that he had &#145;had an accompt from one Killigrew of his bed-chamber&#146;  (Vander Motten, &#145;Lost Years&#146;, 324) of Charles's complete itinerary and the company he kept. It is not clear whether such information, if indeed supplied by Killigrew, amounted to a form of treason or was merely an apology for the king's presence on Dutch soil. From the five letters which Charles wrote to Willem Frederik between March 1659 and April 1662, it is evident that even after 1658 Killigrew continued to enjoy the protection and friendship of the monarch and the stadholder. Both men evidently co-operated in protecting Killigrew's interests, as on the occasion of the request which John Milton, Latin secretary to Cromwell, sent to Killigrew's Frisian paymasters on 27 January 1659, pleading that he be not allowed to escape an outstanding English debt. In the final months of the exile, Killigrew was not exclusively involved in state matters. In a letter from Maastricht dated 11 February 1659 and sent to an unknown friend, he declined the latter's offer to become a Catholic, criticizing at length the idolatrous practices of the church of Rome and its position on transubstantiation (Durham University Library, Cosin MS BI 13).<h2>
<a name="Thetheatremanager16601676"></a>The theatre manager, 1660&#150;1676</h2>Although Pepys on 24 May 1660 recorded meeting Killigrew, &#145;a gentleman of great esteem with the King&#146;  (Pepys, 1.157), on board the <i>Charles</i>, the dramatist's wife, pregnant again, and the three children presumably prolonged their stay in Maastricht. Not until after the birth of Robert (baptized on 4 July 1660) did Charlotte move to London. Before the end of the year, she and her three sons were included in an act of naturalization, which in due course was ratified by the king. In May 1662 Charlotte became keeper of the sweet coffer for the queen, and in June she was made first lady of the privy chamber. Despite his recent re-establishment in London, Killigrew on 12 September 1660 acquired the rights of citizenship of Maastricht. His motives for doing so almost five years after settling down at Maastricht are a matter for speculation. As late as 30 November 1660, the king intervened on his behalf with the Frisian stadholder, asking that Killigrew be allowed to retain his military appointment, which he risked losing as a result of the council of state's plans to cut the expenditure for defence. In the course of 1660 Killigrew petitioned the king for a variety of offices and commodities, including the keepership of the armory at Greenwich, &#145;in consideration of his expense in attendance on His Majesty abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 101), and a parcel of white plate worth &pound;1200 that had belonged to Cromwell. But the financial compensations which Charles must have promised him during the exile had by the end of 1660 not yet materialized&#151;hence perhaps the dramatist's request to retain his Dutch commandership. Not until November 1661 was he granted an annual pension of &pound;500 as a groom of the bedchamber. By then he had completely changed his mind about his overseas obligations, for on 31 October 1661 the king once again intervened with the stadholder, asking him to allow Killigrew to transfer his company, supposedly for health reasons. The favour was granted and in January 1662 Killigrew's company was sold to one Jeremy Roper for 14,000 guilders.<br>
<br>The most singular mark of the king's esteem was of course the licence which in July 1660 he gave to Killigrew and Sir William Davenant &#145;to erect two playhouses &hellip; to control the charges to be demanded, and the payments to actors &hellip; and absolutely suppressing all other playhouses&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 124). Both men thus obtained a virtual monopoly to form two companies of players, produce all and any dramatic entertainments, and license all plays submitted to them. Killigrew's company, known as the King's Men, began acting at the Red Bull on 5 November 1660; they moved to Gibbons's Tennis Court, Vere Street, on 8 November. Davenant's company, under the patronage of the duke of York, possibly started their operations at Salisbury Court by 15 November; they moved to their Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre, fully equipped with movable scenery, in June 1661. When <span class="italic">Claricilla</span> was revived at Vere Street, on 4 July 1661, Pepys remarked on how empty Killigrew's theatre was &#145;since the opera begun&#146;  (Pepys, 2.132).<br>
<br>On 7 May 1663 the King's Company began acting at the new Theatre Royal, Bridges Street, Killigrew holding both acting and building shares in the company. Killigrew boasted a group of experienced actors and actresses drawn from various earlier troupes, including Michael Mohun, Nicholas Burt, Charles Hart, John Lacy, Anne Marshall, and Elizabeth Weaver. Davenant had to compete with a less seasoned troupe but managed to secure the services of Thomas Betterton, who had briefly been a member of the King's Company. Killigrew also had the exclusive rights to a large repertory of pre-Restoration plays, which included nearly all of Ben Jonson's works and many of Shakespeare's. Despite the heavy preponderance of old plays in the repertory of the Theatre Royal in the 1660s, there were few practising playwrights from the earlier period, but several new gentlemen dramatists attached themselves to Killigrew's company. Sir Robert Howard, holder of one quarter of the shares at Bridges Street, and James and Edward Howard wrote for his company in the early 1660s; so did Roger Boyle, earl of Orrery, and possibly Sir George Etherege. Of the professional playwrights Killigrew went on to recruit, none was more important that John Dryden. After negotiations with both companies, he became in April 1668 a playwright-sharer with the King's Company, agreeing to provide them with three plays annually in return for one and one-quarter shares. (Dryden broke the agreement in 1678.) Apparently Nathaniel Lee had a similar agreement, and so did Thomas D'Urfey during part of his career. Elkanah Settle also allied himself with the company in 1673.<br>
<br>As Killigrew's annotated copy of his <span class="italic">Comedies and Tragedies</span> (1664) preserved in the library of Worcester College, Oxford, demonstrates, he was ambitious enough to prepare his own plays for production on the new, scenic stage. <span class="italic">The Princess</span> was revived at Vere Street on 29 November 1661, &#145;the first time &hellip; since before the troubles&#146; in Pepys's words  (Pepys, 2.223). <span class="italic">Claricilla</span> and <span class="italic">The Parson's Wedding</span> proved the most successful of Killigrew's plays. Clandestinely performed at Gibbons's Tennis Court in 1653, <span class="italic">Claricilla</span> (one of the stock plays of Mohun's troupe at the Red Bull in 1660) was successively revived at Vere Street on 1 December 1660 and 4 July 1661, at court in January 1663, and at Bridges Street in March 1669. A performance of <span class="italic">The Parson's Wedding</span>, &#145;acted all by women&#146; according to Pepys  (ibid., 5.289), was scheduled at Bridges Street on 5 or 6 October 1664; it was given again at Lincoln's Inn Fields in June 1672. Much more popular, however, than any of his plays was Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Rover</span>, a lively adaptation of <span class="italic">Thomaso</span>, first produced at Dorset Gardens in March 1677. (As groom of the bedchamber, Killigrew had probably introduced Behn to Charles's intelligence service in 1666.) Despite the manifest advantages Killigrew enjoyed as the manager of the King's Company, he appears to have had insufficient practical sense of the theatre to compete successfully with Davenant, a professional playwright and theatrical innovator. Nevertheless, his theatrical initiatives were by no means despicable. Before the end of 1660, Killigrew beat Davenant in the race to introduce actresses on the stage, a novelty made official in the April 1662 patent issued to him, decreeing that all female parts were to be played by women. On 2 August 1664 he told Pepys of his plans to set up a nursery theatre at Moorfields, &#145;were we shall have the best Scenes and Machines, the best Musique &hellip; and to that end hath sent for voices and painters and other persons from Italy&#146;  (Pepys, 5.230). And in February and September 1667 he boasted to the same interlocutor of the many improvements at his theatre, including the importation of distinguished Italian musicians.<br>
<br>Killigrew's company shared of course in the misfortunes that befell the London stage. In June 1665 the theatres were closed down on account of the plague and on 25 January 1672 a fire destroyed the Theatre Royal, forcing Killigrew's company to move to the playhouse at Lincoln's Inn Fields, recently vacated by the Duke's Men. It is undeniable, however, that the King's Company's problems must be attributed to Killigrew's dubious handling of his theatrical holdings, resulting in conflicts with the disgruntled sharing actors, and, indeed, his own son Charles. As early as 1663, Killigrew had made over his building shares to his brother-in-law Sir John Sayers, to be held in trust for him; he also temporarily delegated the direction of the company to Hart, Mohun, and Lacy. After the death of Sir Henry Herbert, who in 1661&#150;2 had sued the patent-holders for usurping some of his powers, Killigrew was appointed master of the revels on 1 May 1673 but in February 1677 he resigned the post to his son Charles. Only three weeks later, he was forced by law to turn over to Charles his patent and governorship of the company (in 1682 it was discovered that his theatrical property had not been his to control).<br>
<br>Trying to cope with his expensive habits of getting and spending, including his theatrical investments, Killigrew had to borrow money from his wife, whose interests in the Piershil inheritance had been safeguarded by a 1655 contract. Throughout his term as a patentee he petitioned the king for diverse gifts and licences. In December 1663 he requested the grant of a lease of nineteen messuages &#145;in Collier Row, Stepney, and Shoreditch, the manor of Puriton-cum-Crandon, and a house in Bridgewater&#146;, worth &pound;88 a year  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;70</i>, 686). In March 1670, in consideration of his &#145;long and faithful services&#146;  (ibid., <i>1670</i>, 133), he was given the benefit of a bond worth &pound;500, due to the king from one Thomas Pritchard. And the state papers for the years 1671 to 1676 show that he obtained a patent to license &#145;pedlars and petty chapmen&#146;  (ibid., <i>1671</i>, 216) and claimed the right to grant licences for lotteries. After 1676 his interest in the theatre business gradually dwindled.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears16761683"></a>Final years, 1676&#150;1683</h2>According to Pepys, writing on 13 February 1668, Killigrew had been given the title of &#145;King's fool or jester &hellip; and may with privilege revile or jeere any body &hellip; without offence&#146;  (Pepys, 9.66&#150;7). Countless anecdotes survive to prove that it was during his years at Charles's court that Killigrew established his reputation as a flippant conversationalist endowed with a caustic wit. Whether or not this is indicative of a fundamental change of mind, in his declining years he took a fancy to having himself portrayed in a very different guise, first, in the 1670s, as a pilgrim of St James, and after 1680, bearded as St Paul, carrying a sword, the emblem of martyrdom. Financial worries, however, must have weighed the family down, as is suggested by his petition, dated 16 January 1680, for payment of arrears on his pension in the amount of &pound;850.<br>
<br>In 1683 Pier Maria Mazzantini, an Italian physician, asked the king for leave to practise the antidote Orvietan, claiming that it had saved Killigrew's life. &#145;Weak and indisposed in body&#146;, on 15 March 1683 the dramatist drew up his will. He requested to be buried at Westminster Abbey, together with his first wife and his sister Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1681). The largest part of his estate, both &#145;real and personal&#146;, and the arrears on his pension went to his son Henry, who was also made the sole executor. Charlotte and her children were left unmentioned. Killigrew died at Whitehall on 19 March 1683. Within days after her husband's death Charlotte petitioned the king for relief, arguing that she had brought &#145;a considerable fortune to her husband &hellip; though of late by the insinuation of ill people his affections were withdrawn from her so that he has left her and her two youngest sons in a very necessitous condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683</i>, 220). The king obliged by granting her an annual pension of &pound;200; he also contributed &pound;50 to the funeral. Charlotte was buried on 22 April 1715, having survived her children by several years. Roger, born on 17 September 1663, had died prior to July 1694; Robert, a brigadier-general, was killed at the battle of Almanzor on 14 April 1707; and Elizabeth, born on 3 July 1666, may have been buried at St Martin's on 21 April 1690.<br>
