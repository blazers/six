<span class="headword">Payne,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1648), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, was by far the finest native-born engraver working during the reign of Charles I. His earliest plates, the portraits of Hugh Broughton and William Whitaker of 1620, are very much in the manner of Simon de Passe, whose pupil he very probably was. Payne's fifty-three known plates, which bear dates between 1620 and 1639, and most of which are portrait frontispieces or title-plates to books, vary widely in quality. The worst are no better than those of many contemporaries, but the best, such as the portrait of Sir Benjamin Rudyerd of 1632, are outstanding. His masterpiece is the two-plate profile view of the ship <i>Sovereign of the seas</i>, which measures nearly 3 feet across. It was made in 1637&#150;8 to celebrate the ship's launch, and was commissioned by its builder, Peter Pett. The print was praised by John Evelyn and an impression was acquired by Samuel Pepys on 31 January 1663. It was accompanied by a pamphlet by Thomas Heywood, <span class="italic">A true description of his majesties royall and most stately ship called the Soveraign of the seas</span> (1638), the text of which praises Payne and reveals that he was then living by the postern gate near Tower Hill.<br>
<br>On the evidence of a fellow engraver, John Sturt, George Vertue recorded that Payne loved drinking and was careless of his affairs, and that his irregular way of life resulted in his early death. Charles I had intended to appoint him royal engraver (presumably in succession to Robert van Voerst, who had died in 1636), but Payne had neglected to take up the invitation. Thomas Rawlins printed an epitaph to him in an appendix, entitled &#145;Calanthe&#146;, to a volume of meditations, <span class="italic">Good-Friday</span> (1648), where Payne was described as &#145;lately deceased&#146;. This serves as a <i>terminus ante quem</i> for his death.<br>
