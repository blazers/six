<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pilkington,  James</span>  (1520&#150;1576), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was the third of seven sons of Richard Pilkington (<i>c</i>.1486&#150;1551) of Rivington, Lancashire, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Laurence or Lawrence Ashawe of Hall on the Hill, Heath Charnock, in the same county; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22271/', "Leonard Pilkington (1527&#150;1599)")</script> was one of his younger brothers. <h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>At the age of sixteen Pilkington entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, but he soon transferred to St John's College, from where he graduated BA early in 1539. At about the same time he became a fellow. Having proceeded MA in 1542, six years later he became senior fellow and preacher, and in that capacity took part in a disputation on transubstantiation; he also delivered a series of lectures on the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>. Ordained some time between 1547 and 1550, he was presented by Edward VI in the latter year to the vicarage of Kirby in Kendal, Westmorland, but he soon resigned and continued his studies at Cambridge, where he proceeded BTh in 1551. <br>
<br>On the accession of Mary, Pilkington went to the continent and stayed successively in Z&uuml;rich, Geneva, Basel, and Frankfurt am Main. During this period he stood &#145;studiously aloof&#146; from the dissensions of the English exiles and won a reputation for wisdom and moderation, being nominated in December 1558 as a member of Sir Thomas Smith's committee for the revision of the prayer book. However, it is doubtful whether he played a very active role because he remained in Frankfurt until at least March 1559, only a month before the committee concluded its deliberations. <h2>
<a name="Preachingpublicationandpromotion"></a>Preaching, publication, and promotion</h2>On 20 July 1559, soon after his return to England, Pilkington was appointed master of his old college and regius professor of divinity. In the three years that followed he was a prolific author and preacher, both at Cambridge and London. He preached sermons before the queen and at Paul's Cross and delivered the funeral oration at the commemorative service for Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius at Cambridge on 20 July 1560. He contributed to the prayer book of 1559, the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and the <span class="roman">Book of Homilies</span>, and published commentaries on the prophets <span class="roman">Haggai</span> (1560) and <span class="roman">Obadiah</span> (1562). But his most memorable contribution was his involvement in the debate over the destruction of St Paul's Cathedral by lightning on the afternoon of 4 June 1561. Four days later, while the ruins smouldered behind him, Pilkington preached a sermon at Paul's Cross ascribing the event to the wrath of God and &#145;warning of a greater plague to follow if amendment of life were not had in all estates&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, v). The sermon provoked an angry reply from an anonymous Catholic apologist in <span class="italic">An Addition to the Causes</span> alleging, not surprisingly, that God's wrath had indeed been stirred but the cause was &#145;that the old fathers and the old ways were left, together with blaspheming God in lying sermons preached there&#146;  (ibid., v&#150;vi). Pilkington, clearly rattled by this attack, responded with a <span class="italic">Confutation of an Addition</span> (1563), which comprised an uncompromising onslaught on the &#145;strong delusions&#146; and &#145;lying wonders&#146; of the Catholic church. &#145;I would not have blotted so much paper with so much wickedness, nor filled your ears and eyes with so much filthiness, but that he provoked me to it, and calls that good which is evil, and light darkness&#146;  (ibid., vi, 591). The <span class="italic">Confutation</span> was Pilkington's most polemical work and the controversy over the destruction of St Paul's provides a good illustration of the attempts of theologians on both sides of the Reformation divide to fathom the mind of God from his apparent actions on earth. <br>
<br>Late in 1559 Pilkington had been nominated bishop of Winchester, but he is reported to have refused the promotion owing to unhappiness about certain proposed alienations of land from the see. In March 1560 he was arguing that bishops should have a &#145;better living&#146; and the matter remained in limbo until October, when Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, prompted the secretary of state, William Cecil, about the &#145;strange delays&#146; in episcopal appointments. If the queen was determined to promote the gospel, he asked, &#145;why should other[s] hinder her good zeal for money sake, as is most commonly judged?&#146;  (Usher, 396). Since Pilkington was clearly reluctant to take on Winchester because of potential financial losses, Robert Horne, dean of Durham, was offered the position, and Pilkington was induced to accept the bishopric of Durham, which had previously been earmarked for Horne. He received the royal assent for Durham on 20 February 1561, was consecrated on 2 March, and enthroned on 10 April, but it was not until October that he resigned his mastership at St John's, in which he was succeeded by his brother Leonard. <br>
<br>The issue of episcopal endowments remained unresolved, however. The government was anxious to cut the wealthier bishoprics down to size, and Durham was a target for this sort of pruning, just as Winchester was. When Pilkington received his temporalities on 15 March estates valued at &pound;1000 remained with the crown, though most of these, with the exception of Norham and Norhamshire, were returned &#145;during pleasure&#146; on 21 May. Nevertheless, because the bishop was merely a crown tenant of these lands, horrendous and unprecedented legal difficulties ensued, causing Pilkington to complain to both Cecil and the treasury. It was only Cecil's request for a lease of Craike (one of the detained properties) for his son in March 1566 that led to the situation's being resolved, and on 13 June Pilkington eventually received his temporalities (though still with the exception of Norham and Norhamshire). Finally Pilkington had &#145;bargained and won&#146; in his refusal of Winchester and acceptance of Durham. He managed to persuade the government that it had acted &#145;opportunistically, hastily and unwisely&#146; and that the interests of good government were best served by the restoration of the <i>status quo</i>  (Usher, 403, 406). In the meantime, in or before 1564, he married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1596), daughter of Sir John Kingsmill (<i>c</i>.1497&#150;1556) of Sigmanton [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71875/', "Kingsmill family")</script>]. This alliance with a strongly protestant Hampshire family may not have been unconnected with Pilkington's interest in the bishopric of Winchester, but on the other hand, Alice's brother Richard (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1600) was a commissioner for the establishment of religion in the north of England from 1559. The marriage appears to have been kept secret at first, but was presumably known by the time the Pilkingtons' daughter Deborah was baptized at St Andrew's, Auckland, Durham, on 8 October 1564. <h2>
<a name="BishopofDurhamadministration"></a>Bishop of Durham: administration</h2>Pilkington's arrival in Durham in 1561 was undoubtedly something of a culture shock. He complained bitterly to Cecil about the disordered state of the diocese, comparing himself with biblical characters forced into exile or obliged, against their will, to carry out impossible tasks. The difficulties of Durham diocese were, indeed, greater than those encountered by other Elizabethan bishops. There was a shared concern with issues such as Catholic survivalism, pluralism, and non-residence, but Durham also had a number of large impropriate parishes and livings of small value, a problem that was particularly acute in the border areas of Northumberland. Here the shortfall of clergy was often compensated for by Scots, of whom Pilkington had a particular distrust, &#145;vagabonds and wicked men which hide themselves there because they dare not abide in their country and serve for little or nothing&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/12, 108). Since Durham was a palatine see, he also had a secular jurisdiction and was pitched into the middle of an ongoing conflict between the crown and the two leading magnates of the north, the earls of Westmorland and Northumberland. Most of the officers of the palatinate and diocese reflected the conservative views of his predecessor, Cuthbert Tunstall, or were in some way deferential to the two earls. In despair he wrote to Cecil in November 1561: &#145;I know not whether they like me worse or I they &hellip; where I had a little wit at my coming, now have left me almost none&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/20, 25). <br>
<br>Pilkington's first challenge was to procure loyal and reliable administrators and in this objective the visitation of 1561, in which the oath of supremacy was put to officials and clergy, was a major watershed. The old palatinate officers were removed and replaced by more amenable protestants, such as Thomas Calverley and William Fleetwood. In 1563 William Whittingham arrived as dean of the cathedral and soon struck up a good working relationship with the bishop. Moreover, Pilkington had ample opportunity in the 1560s and 1570s to exercise his patronage of cathedral prebends and invariably nominated zealous protestants, many of them being his kinsmen or friends. Robert Swift, chancellor and linchpin of the diocesan administration, was appointed soon after the bishop in 1561, but in other instances Pilkington had first to engineer the removal of non-residents. John Ebden was persuaded to exchange the archdeaconry of Durham for John Pilkington's prebend at St Paul's in 1563; but William King stubbornly held on to the archdeaconry of Northumberland until he was finally deprived in 1566, thus making way for Ralph Lever. The appointment of Lever was Pilkington's only misjudgement among his senior secular and diocesan officers and he resigned in 1573 following an unedifying argument with Swift over visitation articles. Pilkington's active use of patronage was also evident in the diocese, where he was constantly seeking to bring committed protestants to the north. He was a determined protector of the rights of his see and resisted the attempt of Thomas Young, archbishop of York, to visit the diocese of Durham in 1561, telling the archbishop's apparitor, &#145;If thy master will needs come to visit me bade him send me word and I will meet him in the midst of Tees&#146;  (Durham Cathedral Library, Hunter MS 35A, fol. 40). <br>
<br>Only a limited picture of Pilkington's diocesan administration can be drawn because of poor archival survival, but what there is suggests an active involvement in maintaining churches in good repair and ensuring the supply of prescribed protestant texts. He also issued new statutes to regulate the conduct of the consistory court in 1573. Despite poor health, the bishop maintained a personal involvement and one of his last acts, in December 1575, was to write to the archdeacons requesting them to bring before him at Auckland all those who did not attend church or &#145;godly exercises of religion&#146;  (Durham University Library, DR VIII/1, fol. 245). Sir Francis Knollys summed up the situation succinctly when he stated in 1568 that &#145;The Bishop of Durham has his diocese well instructed, though there be obstacles in his way&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1563&#150;9</i>, 514). What these obstacles were Pilkington never wearied of explaining to anyone prepared to listen to him. They were the indifferent support given to protestantism by the central government; the attempts of secular forces to profit at the expense of the church; and the continued survival of Catholicism and crypto-Catholicism due to inadequate efforts to suppress it. <h2>
<a name="BishopofDurhamdisciplineandeducationalbenefaction"></a>Bishop of Durham: discipline and educational benefaction</h2>Despite his acceptance of high office in the Elizabethan church, Pilkington was uneasy about certain aspects of the settlement of 1559 which did not satisfy his protestant convictions. As the controversy over the imposition of vestments loomed in 1565, he wrote twice to the earl of Leicester about the issue and Parker was of the opinion that he &#145;will give over his bishopric rather than it shall take place in his diocese&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Matthew Parker</span>, 237). Durham was therefore regarded as a test case, which explains why, during 1566 and 1567, six leading figures in the diocese&#151;including the dean, chancellor, and archdeacon of Durham&#151;were called before the ecclesiastical commissioners at York accused of vestiarian offences. Despite the fact that two of the accused were deprived of their cathedral prebends (Thomas Lever and William Birche), the bishop did not &#145;give over&#146; his diocese, the compromise, perhaps, being that they were allowed to retain their other preferments. Yet Pilkington's administration does not display overt puritanical zeal. The only charge of iconoclasm levelled against him refers to the secularization of the redundant collegiate church of Auckland where &#145;he allowed both shooting and bowling&#146;  (J. F. Hodgson, 169) and in 1566 he prudently wrote to Cecil before he issued a preaching licence to Christopher Goodman, who was making a temporary stay in Newcastle. In a letter to Rodolph Gualter in 1573 Pilkington expressed dismay at the tactics of the new generation of puritan leaders who threatened to see the church &#145;wholly rent in pieces&#146;  (Robinson, 286.8). <br>
<br>Pilkington probably saw his chief contribution to protestantism being made by means of education, which he always promoted earnestly. On his going to Durham in 1561 he informed Cecil that he was considering starting a school in his house, and in 1567 he and the earl of Westmorland petitioned the queen for the foundation of the Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth at Darlington. But his main achievement was the foundation of Rivington School, Lancashire, on 13 May 1566. The school, &#145;for the bringing up, teaching and instructing children and youth in grammar and other good learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, xi), adjoined the chapel which had been founded by his father and was endowed with copyhold lands at Heighington and Cockfield in Durham. The chapel itself was at the same time freed from the jurisdiction of Bolton parish church and a remarkable portrait of Pilkington's parents, along with their twelve children, was painted to commemorate the occasion. <br>
<br>Although Pilkington was capable of working constructively with the secular authorities and the confrontational aspect of his personality has been exaggerated in the past, he was, as has been seen, a firm upholder of the financial prerogatives of the church. A second conflict with the treasury centred on the forfeitures following the rebellion of 1569, which were claimed by Pilkington as part of his prerogative and only secured for the queen by virtue of an act of attainder. Similarly, Leicester had been rebuffed by the bishop when he attempted to obtain a lease of Howden for Walter Jobson in 1561. &#145;We may preach here and do what we will&#146;, he wrote to Cecil, &#145;but if we fill not their bellies all is in vain &hellip; I would I had been whipped when I left Cambridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1561&#150;2</i>, 224&#150;6). Local people too felt the brunt of the bishop's determined protection of church endowments. There were quarrels over coal-producing lands at Chester-le-Street and Ryton, and the hospitals of the diocese were particular points of friction. Here charitable institutions had been suppressed or endowments spirited away as a result of the changes of the Reformation period. The most serious case was Sherburn, Durham's largest hospital, where Thomas Lever became master in 1562. Lever was determined to undertake reform and Pilkington gave him his full support, much to the discomfort of local gentry who had benefited from leases made by previous masters. <br>
<br>Another area of tension was Catholicism. The visitations of 1559 and 1561 had gone some of the way to removing persistent reactionaries, but the problem of Catholic survivalism was far from solved. Some Catholics remained in the church by making a pretence at conformity, while others, deprived of their livings, joined the households of the nobility and gentry of the north. But the most serious difficulty, from Pilkington's point of view, was caused by those individuals who had gone overseas to Louvain and were acting as intermediaries between the forces of international Catholicism and their old friends and associates in the region. One of those giving support to the Louvain exiles was John Raymes, master of St Mary's Hospital, Newcastle, who was using the resources of the institution to help supply seditious literature. In 1565 Pilkington sent a sample of this to Cecil commenting that &#145;wise men do marvel that policy can suffer such seed of sedition &hellip; surely, evil men pick much evil out of such books&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 8, fol. 87). Nevertheless, attempts to dislodge Raymes in 1564 and 1567 failed, and the relative strength of Catholicism was demonstrated by incidents at Sedgefield and Barnard Castle in 1567 when conservative parishioners clashed with puritan clergy. In November and December 1569 these forces came violently to the fore during the rebellion, when Catholicism was briefly restored in the diocese. Pilkington was forced to flee in face of the rebel advance and in his absence his house and property were plundered. Even after the suppression of the rising his problems with the local Catholics were not over. In 1571 Stephen Marley, prebendary of Durham, was deprived for failure to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and in the same year the bishop reported to Cecil continuing problems with former rebels and their wives and the ongoing flow of materials to and from Louvain. &#145;This people grows wild and I am left alone&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/81, 48), was his typically pessimistic conclusion. <h2>
<a name="Willdeathandlegacy"></a>Will, death, and legacy</h2>By the standards of Elizabethan bishops, Pilkington did not have a large family. Two sons, Isaac (<i>bap</i>. 8 March 1567/8) and Joshua, died young and the bishop was survived by only two daughters, Deborah and Ruth (<i>bap</i>. 3 July 1569). He made his will on 4 February 1571, entrusting his wife to distribute his goods &#145;according to such talk as I have declared unto her&#146;  (Greenwell, 2.8&#150;11). The will was accompanied by two codicils, one (dated 1 January 1576) noting Deborah's (surprisingly early) marriage contract with Thomas Gargrave and marriage portion of &pound;800; the other (undated and not included in the grant of probate) probably comprising a summary of the bishop's verbal instructions to his wife. He left legacies to his family, servants, Rivington School, and the poor, reserving various items of furniture for his successor (if he would accept them) in lieu of dilapidations. This offer was not accepted by Richard Barnes, who commenced action against the bishop's executors concerning the decayed state of some of the episcopal residences. Later Thomas Fuller alleged that each of Pilkington's daughters received &pound;4000 on marriage and that this antagonized the queen, but the statement is not borne out by the bishop's will. Elizabeth's hostility, if it existed, was more likely rooted in Pilkington's puritanism and his attitude to church endowments. <br>
<br>Pilkington never enjoyed a robust constitution. As early as 1556 he took a journey to the C&eacute;vennes for his health and in 1573 commented to Gualter about his &#145;frequent infirmities&#146; and how he was &#145;perpetually struggling with disease and death&#146;  (Robinson, 286). He died, probably at Bishop Auckland, on 23 January 1576 at the age of fifty-five, Swift remarking that &#145;this wicked country &hellip; caused Mr James Pilkington to spend his life in continual pains and mournings and at length ended him&#146;. He was initially buried in the church of St Andrew, Auckland, no doubt in response to his own request that he should be laid to rest &#145;with as few popish ceremonies as may be or vain cost&#146;  (Greenwell, 8), but, apparently on the initiative of Swift, he was exhumed and moved to Durham Cathedral, where he was reburied on 24 May 1576 at the head of Bishop Beaumont's tomb in front of the high altar. A Latin epitaph accompanied his monument, which has not survived. Pilkington's <span class="italic">Exposition on Nehemiah</span> was left unfinished at his death and was published by his friend John Foxe in 1585 with a preface by him.<br>
