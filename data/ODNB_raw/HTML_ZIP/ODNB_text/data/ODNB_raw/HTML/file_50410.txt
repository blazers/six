<span class="headword">Downes,  Hubert Downes  Cherry-</span>  (1876&#150;1964), <span class="occ">maltster</span>, was born on 23 September 1876 at Hemington vicarage, near Oundle, Northamptonshire, the third of the four surviving children of Benjamin Newman Cherry (1840&#150;1905), vicar of Hemington, and his wife, Rosa Georgina, daughter of Edward Barratt-Lennard of Belhus Park, Essex. In 1909 he inherited from his godfather, Samuel Downes, the family's Cheshire estate, on condition that he assume by royal licence the name and arms of Downes. Hubert was educated at Winchester College. Afterwards he trained for two years with the old-established millers and maltsters Thorpe &amp; Sons of Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, spending a final year in London studying the technical aspects of malting. In 1897 he was offered a partnership in the Burton upon Trent malting firm of L. and G. Meakin but, with two other Burton maltsters, founded Richards, Cherry and Yeoman. Three years later, the business was registered as a limited liability company (renamed Yeomans, Cherry and Curtis), but soon after, Hubert returned to Thorpes to manage the grain side of the business.<br>
<br>In 1901, Cherry-Downes married Adeline Rachel Barclay (<i>b</i>. 1872), daughter of Colonel Hanbury Barclay, chairman of the London brewers, Barclay Perkins. There were two sons, both of whom followed their father into his malting business, and one daughter. The elder son, Hubert Arthur Downes Cherry-Downes, also took over the Cheshire estate. Although later sold to counter heavy taxation, land on the Nottinghamshire&#150;Lincolnshire border, including North Clifton Manor, was purchased and farmed.<br>
<br>Following his inheritance in 1909, Cherry-Downes decided to leave Newark, but after the death of Thomas Earp MP was asked to become managing partner of the prestigious maltsters Gilstrap, Earp &amp; Sons. He accepted, and assumed effective control, and, when in 1921 the firm was incorporated with a capital of &pound;100,000, became its first managing director. The following year, at the depth of the post-war slump, Cherry-Downes proposed a scheme to rationalize the malting industry by the closure of redundant maltings. His ideas were too radical and found little support, but six years later he merged Gilstrap, Earp &amp; Sons with four other substantial malting firms; the company was renamed Associated British Maltsters (ABM) in 1929. Cherry-Downes served as joint managing director, 1928&#150;54, and non-executive director until his retirement, aged eighty-two, in 1958. An expert barley buyer (so influential he was said to control local markets), he was also a driving force behind the rapid expansion which took ABM to the forefront of European malting.<br>
<br>Cherry-Downes worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the malting industry. In 1917, with trade halted by war controls and threatened by the possible nationalization of brewing, he was instrumental in reviving the Maltsters Association of Great Britain, which had lapsed since the repeal of the malt tax in 1880. As its chairman (1920&#150;24 and 1935&#150;45), he served the executive committee for thirty years. During both wars he was appointed to the joint advisory committee of brewers and maltsters which worked in conjunction with the Ministry of Food, and in 1923 served the departmental committee advising the Treasury on barley import duties.<br>
<br>Cherry-Downes' great love was the countryside. Always to be seen in his favoured dress of plus fours, he was a lifelong member of the Newark and Nottinghamshire Agricultural Society, its president in 1924, and vice-president thereafter. A great authority on horses, he rode to hounds and was for many years a steward at Southwell racecourse. In 1925 he became a racehorse owner, his greatest success coming three years later when his horse Hank won the Foxhunters' Chase at Liverpool. A talented sportsman, he was also a keen shot and golfer. He was a JP for Newark and, although not deeply involved in local politics, a member of Newark Conservative Association. Cherry-Downes died of heart failure at his home, Southfield House, Millgate, Newark, on 1 October 1964 and was cremated at Wilford Hill, Nottingham, two days later. He was survived by his wife, and left an estate valued at more than &pound;100,000.<br>
