<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1652&#150;1683), <span class="occ">Quaker schismatic</span>, was from Millholme, New Hutton, Westmorland. Little else is known of his background, except that he was a husbandman and was convinced by George Fox in 1652 near Sedbergh. As one of the early Quakers, he travelled with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69125/', "John Story")</script> of Preston Patrick from about 1654 to spread the Quaker message in the south and west of England, and the two were &#145;Instrumentall to Convince many in sevrall parts&#146; and were &#145;greatly beloved of the Brethren&#146;, while in &#145;unity with the ffriends&#146;  (Penney, 267). In July 1654 he and Story wrote to George Fox from Cinderhill Green on the Yorkshire&#150;Derbyshire border, relating details of their meetings in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. They may have passed into Cumberland and Durham as an undated letter expresses their wish to visit these areas. In 1655 both were in Wiltshire, the centre of their early work, where they convinced several Baptists. Wilkinson wrote to fellow Quakers Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill, reporting that, &#145;Many falls from them; they have no courage left&#146;  (Braithwaite, <span class="italic">Beginnings</span>, 387). In the same year both Wilkinson and Story were imprisoned in Gloucester gaol and at some point in the 1650s they spent time in Bristol. A letter of 1655 suggests that Wilkinson was married, evidence reinforced by the Quaker digest registers which record the birth of Sarah Wilkinson on 30 January 1661 whose father was named as John Wilkinson of Millhome and member of Kendal monthly meeting. In 1662 Wilkinson and a fellow Quaker, John Audland, were arrested in Westmorland for refusing the oath of allegiance. During his imprisonment, Wilkinson wrote a short piece on persecution entitled &#145;Some queries to any that profess themselves Christians&#146; which was included in Audland's <span class="italic">The Suffering Condition of the Servants of the Lord</span> (1662). It is likely that he was the John Wilkinson who visited Ireland in 1669 along with William Penn, Solomon Eccles, and John Banks.<br>
<br>About the end of 1672, Wilkinson rejoined Story, who was leading a group of dissatisfied Preston Patrick Friends in opposition to the movement's stance of meeting openly in defiance of the second <span class="roman">Conventicles Act</span> of 1670. The breakaway group was also opposed to Fox's establishment of women's meetings and other Quaker practices such as the recording of papers of condemnation against errant Quakers, and the insistence that the tithe testimony should be upheld even if individual Friends did not feel moved to do so. It would appear that Wilkinson was initially reluctant to break with mainstream Friends as in October 1671 he had approved of the establishment of a women's meeting at Kendal &#145;for unity's-sake&#146;  (Wilkinson, 38), and the following year he had specifically criticized Preston Patrick Friends for neglecting meetings. Quaker records state that he &#145;at first seemed tendrly to accord with ffaithfull ffriends in Incorageing faithfull womens Meetings&#146; and &#145;allso in ffriends Care and Inspection&#146; and &#145;that all their Xtian [Christian] testemonys might be ffaithfully kept up&#146; but eventually &#145;quickly Joyned&#146; with Story after the latter returned from a visit in the south  (Penney, 267). Even so, Wilkinson has been judged as playing a smaller role than Story in the events that followed and what was to become known as the Wilkinson&#150;Story separation.<br>
<br>In January 1675 Wilkinson and Story met George Fox at Worcester Castle to discuss the divisions, but soon after they openly separated from the movement. A paper condemning them was issued by the 1675 yearly meeting, and they refused to attend two further meetings which had invited them to Westmorland Friends. While in Bristol with William Rogers, who later wrote <span class="italic">The Christian Quaker</span> (1680) in their defence, Wilkinson and Story were asked to attend a meeting at Draw-well in April 1676 with leading Quakers at which Wilkinson and Story maintained their reasons for separation but did admit to wrongdoing in opposing Friends &#145;in the practice of those things that they testify are commendable in the Church of God&#146;  (Braithwaite, <span class="italic">Second Period</span>, 306). The two then visited Fox at Swarthmoor but their resentment at the way in which mainstream Quakers had misrepresented their actions at Draw-well prevented a lasting reconciliation. After the 1677 yearly meeting issued another strong condemnation of the Wilkinson&#150;Story separation, the Westmorland quarterly meeting removed meetings for worship from the homes of dissident Friends. A number of Quaker meetings thus became wholly separated and at Hutton, Wilkinson himself was apparently able to carry with him the entire meeting of about six families.<br>
<br>Little has been recorded of Wilkinson in his later years except that he remained loyal to his friend John Story, who died in 1681. He wrote &#145;A brief relation concerning the life and death of John Story&#146; in <span class="italic">The Memory of that Servant of God, John Story, Revived</span> (1683), which also contained the testimonies of other sympathetic Friends. In his remaining years Wilkinson appears to have carried on travelling and holding meetings, visiting Reading in 1678 and Bristol about the same time. He seems never to have been reconciled with the rest of the movement: &#145;he was &hellip; laboured with and visited by sevrall Brethern, &amp; sometimes seemed somewt softer, yet did not Joyne againe in unity&#146;  (Penney, 268). He is believed to have died and been buried at Kendal a few years after Story's death.<br>
