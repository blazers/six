<span class="headword">Taylor,  Thomas</span>  (1758&#150;1835), <span class="occ">philosopher and translator</span>, was born on 15 May 1758 near Bunhill Fields, London, the son of Joseph Taylor, staymaker, of Round Court, St Martin's-le-Grand; details of his mother are unknown. He was sickly as a child and spent some years in Staffordshire, but on 10 April 1767 he was admitted to St Paul's School, his parents intending him for the dissenting ministry. There he evinced an aptitude for philosophical studies, and began his acquaintance with classical languages, but his dissatisfaction with the teaching at the school, together with his disinclination for the Christian ministry, led to his withdrawal from the school after a few years. At about this time he fell in love with Mary Morton (<i>d</i>. 1809), whom he later married. During this period at home he began his study of mathematics. When he was fifteen Taylor was sent to work for an uncle at the dockyard at Sheerness, which he left after three years. The next two years were spent as a pupil of Mr Worthington of Salters' Hall meeting-house, where he revived his knowledge of Greek and Latin, while at the same time paying court to his future wife, and deepening his knowledge of mathematics. The time came for him to go to the University of Aberdeen, but the discovery by their parents of his precipitate marriage to Mary Morton required him to seek employment, first as a boarding-school usher, and later as a bank clerk at Lubbock's Bank. At that time they moved south of the Thames to 9 Manor Place, Walworth.<br>
<br>During this period Taylor in his spare moments embarked on his study of philosophy, beginning with Aristotle and then moving to Plato, both of whom he studied in the original, seeking guidance from ancient commentaries, mainly of Neoplatonic inspiration. After six years as a bank clerk Taylor sought escape by drawing on his studies to devise a perpetual lamp. The demonstration at the Freemasons' Tavern was disastrous, but brought him to the attention of potential patrons and thus enabled him to devote his time to the study of ancient philosophy. His next public enterprise was a series of twelve lectures on Platonic philosophy at the house of the sculptor John Flaxman. In Flaxman's circle he may very well have met William Blake, though there is no positive evidence of their personal acquaintance. In 1787 he began to publish translations of works of ancient philosophy, beginning with the earliest of Plotinus's <span class="italic">Enneads</span> (i.6), on the &#145;beautiful&#146;, and the &#145;Orphic hymns&#146;, this latter with a lengthy preface on the life and theology of Orpheus. Various of these translations were subsidized by patrons, for instance his translation of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Metaphysics</span> (1801) by the brothers William and George Meredith. However, his most notable early patron was Charles Howard, eleventh duke of Norfolk, who made it possible for Taylor to publish the first English translation of the complete works of Plato (1804), revising and completing the work begun by Floyer Sydenham (1710&#150;1787), whom he had known in his latter years.<br>
<br>In 1797 Taylor obtained the post of assistant secretary to the Society of Arts, which he resigned in 1806 to devote himself more completely to translation. While working on his translation of Plato, Taylor visited Oxford, where he was graciously received, though he felt himself the object of condescension on the part of the dons and was depressed by the &#145;monkish gloom&#146; and &#145;black melancholy&#146; of the university  (letter dated 20 June 1802, Raine, 20n.). These translations were followed by many others, including the works of the later Neoplatonists, such as Plotinus, his disciple Porphyry, Iamblichus, Julian the Apostate, Synesius the Christian bishop, but especially Proclus, as well as the religious sources of their philosophy, for example, the Chaldaean oracles.<br>
<br>Taylor's approach to this philosophy was determined by his initial encounter with it, through reading Aristotle and Plato together with the Neoplatonic commentaries, which encouraged an understanding of the essential unity of Aristotle and Plato, provided by their Neoplatonic interpretation. His approach then flew in the face of what understanding there was of classical philosophy; even someone like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, more sympathetic than most to later Neoplatonism, was profoundly convinced of the fundamental contrast between Plato and Aristotle. Taylor's translations were received with almost uniform derision, which focused on his awkward English and his evident enthusiasm for late Neoplatonism (not least its defence of paganism). Even Coleridge said that with Taylor &#145;difficult Greek is transmuted into incomprehensible English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Notebooks</span>, n. 1740), and when Stephen MacKenna undertook his acclaimed translation of Plotinus's <span class="italic">Enneads</span> he confessed &#145;for reasons mainly literary, that the work of this devoted pioneer would not be helpful&#146;  (Plotinus, 1.114). It was to be many years before Taylor's enthusiasm for later Neoplatonism would find any kind of echo in the world of scholarship.<br>
<br>Taylor was also lampooned as &#145;the modern Platonist&#146; in Isaac Disraeli's novel <span class="italic">Vaurien</span> (1797), and is perhaps the model for Sipsop the Pythagorean in Blake's <span class="italic">An Island in the Moon</span>; in both cases fun is made of his fondness for animals, especially cats. (An earlier publication had been his <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Brutes</span> (1792), written in response to Mary Wollstonecraft's <span class="italic">Vindication &hellip; of Men</span> (1790), in which he asserted the rationality of animals.) Other nicknames included the Platonist, and the (English) Pagan. It was said of Taylor that there was &#145;nothing remarkable in his exterior&#146;, and that he was of &#145;middle size [&hellip;] regular, open and benevolent&#146; of countenance  (Welsh, 133). However, his surviving portrait, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, with his large eyes and thick eyebrows, makes him look rather hawkish.<br>
<br>It was through Taylor's translations that the Romantic poets had access to Platonism: they are probably one of the sources of Blake's mythology, as well as his repudiation of the natural science of Bacon and Newton, and his late tempera painting <span class="italic">The Arlington Court Picture</span> was almost certainly inspired by Taylor's translation of Porphyry's <span class="italic">On the Cave of the Nymphs</span>; there is no doubt that Coleridge's acquaintance with Proclus was assisted by Taylor's translation and commentary, though Coleridge's appreciation of Taylor is invariably laced with acid criticism. Taylor's immediate influence in England was short-lived; only at the end of the century did those with an enthusiasm for ancient Gnosticism, such as G. R. S. Mead, revive his memory. His fate in America was very different. R. W. Emerson read Taylor's translations enthusiastically, and Taylor's influence was felt among Emerson's disciples, adepts of &#145;transcendental philosophy&#146; such as Amos Bronson Alcott, William T. Harris, Thomas M. Johnson, Hiram K. Jones, and Thomas Wentworth Higginson, though that influence had waned by the end of the century. Emily Dickinson, who was a friend of Higginson, therefore probably owed her Platonism ultimately to Thomas Taylor.<br>
<br>Taylor's marriage to his childhood sweetheart ended with her death on 1 April 1809; they had two daughters and four sons, the youngest of whom was called Thomas Proclus. Taylor married again, and had more children; his second wife died on 23 April 1823. He died of a disease of the bladder at Walworth on 1 November 1835, and was buried on 6 November in the graveyard of St Mary's, Newington Butts, London.<br>
