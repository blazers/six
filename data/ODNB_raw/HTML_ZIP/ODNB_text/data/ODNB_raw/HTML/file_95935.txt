<span class="headword">Ingrams,  Leonard Victor</span>  (1941&#150;2005), <span class="occ">banker and opera impresario</span>, was born on 1 September 1941 at Stoneycrest Nursing Home, Hindhead, Surrey, the fourth and youngest son of Leonard St Clair Ingrams (1900&#150;1953), banker, and his second wife, Victoria Susan Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reid (1908&#150;1997). His father served in the Ministry of Economic Warfare during the Second World War, and was managing director of Continental Assets Realization Trust Ltd thereafter. Richard Ingrams (<i>b</i>. 1937), editor of <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> and <span class="italic">The Oldie</span>, was an elder brother. Wartime took the brothers to live with their grandmother, Lady Reid, in Ellon, Aberdeenshire. She had been a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria and had married the queen's doctor, Sir James Reid of Ellon, first baronet. Ingrams's mother encouraged her sons to play music: he learned the violin and met Vaughan Williams, Benjamin Britten, and Charles M&uuml;nch, and played in the British Youth Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent.<br>
<br>Ingrams went to Stonyhurst College and in 1959 won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1961 he met Rosalind Anne Moore, the daughter of a diplomat, Antony Ross Moore, who was about to go to Oxford. They married on 19 September 1964 when she was twenty-one, and later had four children, three daughters, Lucy Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1965), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1971), and Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1976), and a son, Rupert Antony (<i>b</i>. 1967). Meanwhile, with firsts from Oxford in classical moderations (1961) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1963), a Derby scholarship (1963), and a senior scholarship (1964), in 1964 Ingrams took up a post as assistant lecturer in classics at Queen Mary College, London, but after two years gave up teaching and decided to enter Barings, the family bank. He and his family were then sent on a number of successful postings in Paris, Cologne, Hamburg, and Vienna between 1968 and 1969.<br>
<br>In 1974 Barings sent Ingrams as British adviser to the newly created Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency in Jiddah, together with David Mulford, later American ambassador in New Delhi. The agency required external expertise to manage the increasing assets generated by the kingdom's sudden oil wealth and Ingrams with his team implemented major government investment programmes. There he also pioneered the Jiddah (and later Riyadh) concert committee that by courtesy of the British embassy invited international professionals to sing or play in concerts. In 1980 he was appointed OBE for &#145;services to the British community&#146; in Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile he served simultaneously as a managing director (one of a large number) of Baring Bros (1975&#150;81). A series of employments followed: as chief financial adviser to the Saudi government (1981&#150;4), a director of Robert Fleming Holdings (1985&#150;96), and senior vice-president of the Arab Banking Corporation (1996&#150;8). He was also a director of the Deutschland Investment Corporation (1990&#150;99; chairman, 1990&#150;96), and of the Czech and Slovak Investment Corporation (1992&#150;2005; chairman, 1992&#150;6). In 1998 he set up his own financial enterprise, L. V. Ingrams &amp; Co. Ltd.<br>
<br>In 1982 Ingrams bought Garsington Manor, near Oxford, celebrated for the literati invited there by Lady Ottoline and Philip Morrell between 1915 and 1927. In 1988 an excellent acoustic was discovered from the loggia and in 1989 two nights of <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> (in aid of the reopening of the Oxford Playhouse) brought in scores of fan letters. The following year Garsington Opera Ltd was formed. For six weeks each year the loggia became the stage, an orchestra pit held sixty, and a temporary auditorium held an audience of 500.<br>
<br>Ingrams immediately began to explore little-known repertory, beginning with Haydn's <span class="italic">Orlando Paladino</span>, a British premi&egrave;re, in 1990. He introduced seven Haydn operas to the stage between 1990 and 1997. He pursued known and little-known works by Rossini (nine in total) and Richard Strauss (eight in total), as well as the entire Mozart repertory, including the little-known <span class="italic">Philosopher's Stone</span>. Only a fraction of Rossini's and Strauss's work was familiar to the British opera public: Ingrams's introduction of these forgotten works brought a new understanding to audiences and conductors alike and, eventually, also to the critics. Other &#145;discoveries&#146; included Schumann's <span class="italic">Genoveva</span>, Strauss's <span class="italic">Die &Auml;gyptische Helena</span> and <span class="italic">Die Liebe der Danae</span>, Tchaikovsky's <span class="italic">Cherevichki</span>, Jan&aacute;&#269;ek's <span class="italic">&#352;&aacute;rka</span>, and Rimsky-Korsakov's <span class="italic">Mayskaya Noch</span>&#151;whose first British professional productions were all at Garsington. During the first ten years the opera company suffered various prosecutions and refusals of planning permission until in 1995 an appeal by Ingrams at Oxford crown court found in his favour, and eventually, after a public inquiry, planning permission was granted.<br>
<br>In September 2000 Leonard and Rosalind Ingrams received from the queen of Denmark the European Culture Project award for performing arts on behalf of Garsington Opera, for their &#145;innovative and successful initiative in the performing arts and their exemplary nurturing of young talent&#146;. Ingrams always sought and encouraged rising young artists, attending end-of-term performances at the music academies, and many of those he cast went on to take major roles. In his search for voices, character, and musicianship he explored widely: among other venues he travelled to Drottningholm in Sweden, le Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Pesaro and Palermo in Italy, as well as extensively in Britain. Orla Boylan, Juanita Lascarro, Melanie Diener, and Johannes Manov all made their British d&eacute;buts in Garsington. The London Barbican's <span class="italic">Mostly Mozart</span> summer series invited four semi-staged Garsington Mozart productions, <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> (2002), <span class="italic">La finta giardiniera</span> (2003), <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> (2004), and <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span> (2005).<br>
<br>On 27 July 2005, while driving back from Glyndebourne, Ingrams died of a heart attack at the wheel, with his wife beside him. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Ashford Hospital, Stanwell, Surrey. His four children survived him. Two years later, the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, re-produced the director&#150;designer David Fielding's 1997 Garsington production of Strauss's <span class="italic">Die &Auml;gyptische Helena</span> (starring Deborah Voigt), a fitting tribute to Ingrams and his creation, Garsington Opera.<br>
