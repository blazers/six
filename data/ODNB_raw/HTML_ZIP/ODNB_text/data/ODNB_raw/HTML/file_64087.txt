<span class="headword">MacLeod,  Norman, of MacLeod</span>  (1754&#150;1801), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 4 March 1754 at Brodie Castle, Forres, Moray, the only son of John MacLeod (<i>d</i>. 1767) and Emilia Brodie (<i>b</i>. 1730), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64093/', "Alexander Brodie of Brodie")</script>, lord Lyon king of arms. He was educated privately, principally in Edinburgh under the care of Professor George Stuart, and then at the University of St Andrews (1769) and University College, Oxford (1770). In 1772 he succeeded his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64086/', "Norman MacLeod")</script> as chief of clan MacLeod.<br>
<br>For the proud head of an ancient family that claimed descent from Danish royalty, MacLeod's inheritance was a singularly unhappy one. Ruin stared him in the face. The estates were buried under a mountain of debt, numerous relatives had to be provided for, creditors were pressing for payment, and the tenantry (who were struggling to pay their rents) were considering mass emigration to America. The young chief met the crisis head on. Meetings were arranged with the tenantry, and, by promising to live among them, temporarily reduce their rents, and attend to their interests, he dissuaded most from emigrating. The response of the clan's middle and lower ranks to MacLeod's appeals convinced him of their attachment, and may have prepared him psychologically for the subsequent adoption of quasi-democratic political opinions. MacLeod's determination to live among his clan, however, was short-lived. Strict economy and attention to estate management were uncongenial and offered little hope of significantly reducing his debts, while life in the remote fastness of Dunvegan Castle was unappealing to an ambitious young man impatient to prove himself on a bigger stage.<br>
<br>The approach of war in America offered MacLeod a chance of escaping from the gloom that had enveloped him on Skye, and in 1775 he was commissioned with the rank of captain into the 71st regiment. While undertaking training at Inverness, he met and, on 25 March 1776, married Mary MacKenzie (<i>d</i>. 1784), daughter of Kenneth MacKenzie of Suddie, Ross-shire. Taken prisoner <i>en route</i> to the front, he never saw active service in America, but his early experience of military life did not sour him and, shortly after his return in 1779, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd battalion of the 42nd regiment.<br>
<br>In March 1781 the battalion sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, but, to MacLeod's delight, it was diverted to India, where the prospects of fame and fortune were far brighter. In 1782, shortly after his arrival, he was placed in command of a small force which defeated the vastly more numerous army of Tipu Sahib at Panniani. Ever prickly about matters of honour, MacLeod reacted furiously when a lieutenant-colonel in the East India Company army was given command over him. Honour and prospects were restored when, in April 1783, he was awarded the brevet rank of brigadier-general and placed in command of his own army. The subsequent campaign on the Malabar coast enhanced his military reputation and added significantly to his wealth.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife on 20 February 1784, MacLeod married in the same year Sarah Stackhouse (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1767), daughter of Nathaniel Stackhouse, second in the council at Bombay. In 1785 his spirits rose when he was transferred to Bengal and appointed second in command of the army there, a post worth &pound;6000 a year. His hopes, however, were seemingly blasted in 1788, when a general order was issued depriving all British army officers of brevet rank in India. The mortified MacLeod lobbied hard to have the order rescinded, but to no avail. Determined to seek redress and to revive his stalled career, he returned home in 1789.<br>
<br>Since boyhood MacLeod had entertained thoughts of a parliamentary career, and during his absence abroad his political ambitions had been ably nursed. Armed with a conditional endorsement from Henry Dundas, he worked hard to cultivate the Inverness-shire freeholders and successfully negotiated an agreement with the crucially important Fraser interest, in return for whose support in the 1790 election he would push a Fraser candidate in the one following. The duke of Gordon's hated army of &#145;parchment barons&#146; (whose qualification to vote rested upon legal technicality rather than the law as traditionally understood) was thus outmanoeuvred, and Gordon was brought reluctantly to back MacLeod, who was then returned unopposed.<br>
<br>MacLeod supported Pitt's administration to the best of his limited parliamentary abilities until 7 May 1791, when a meeting with Dundas went so disastrously wrong as to ignite MacLeod's explosive temper and cause him to cross the floor of the house. The breach, which was apparently occasioned by Dundas's refusal to accede to MacLeod's demand for a specific appointment before agreeing to return to India, was bitter and permanent. He attached himself firmly to the opposition and the cause of political reform. Long opposed to &#145;fictitious&#146; votes, MacLeod now argued for extending the county franchise. He attended the county reformers' convention, held at Edinburgh in July 1792, and proposed that the franchise should be vested in those owning land worth an annual valued rent of &pound;100. His ideas were not adopted, but his optimism was undimmed.<br>
<br>A member of the London Society of the Friends of the People since May 1792, MacLeod had found on his return to Scotland that numbers of gentlemen were discussing the formation of a Scottish association based on the same principles. Although he attended the Scottish burgh reformers' convention, where he urged the burghs to co-operate with the London Friends by organizing petitions in favour of parliamentary reform, he was not actively involved in the establishment of the Scottish Association of the Friends of the People. He had no qualms, however, about supporting this plebeian organization.<br>
<br>MacLeod addressed the delegate meetings of the local societies in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, advocating equal representation and short parliaments, and urging petitions as the proper constitutional means of obtaining reform. Having returned to London in December, he did not attend the first national convention of the Scottish Friends of the People, but the growing conservative alarm at the radical reform movement's progress only convinced him of the need to increase his support for the Scottish radicals. On his arrival in Edinburgh in January 1793 he again addressed the local societies, stressing his confidence in them and their cause, while his morale-raising pamphlet <span class="italic">Letters to the People of North Britain</span> (1793) was serialized in the radically inclined <span class="italic">Edinburgh Gazetteer</span>. He presented the Edinburgh petition in support of Grey's reform motion of May 1793 and voted with the minority, but by then he was losing interest in the reform movement. The formal breach did not come until November, but as early as February he had turned his attention to the opportunities offered by the outbreak of war with France.<br>
<br>Numerous approaches for military employment over the next four years were rebuffed, but given that MacLeod continued vigorously to oppose the government's policies, arguing in his <span class="italic">Considerations on False and Real Alarms</span> (1794) that the war was both misconceived and ruinously expensive, the wonder is that he persevered in his applications. With no prospect of retaining his Inverness-shire seat, he fired off a violent valedictory and sought refuge in the venal constituency of Milborne Port. The expenditure of &pound;15,000 failed to convince the electors there of his merits, and MacLeod retreated north to spend his declining years in reduced circumstances, bad health, and low spirits. A jaunt to Ireland in 1800 provided only temporary relief from his depression. A cruise was arranged to restore his health, but he died at Guernsey on 16 August 1801.<br>
