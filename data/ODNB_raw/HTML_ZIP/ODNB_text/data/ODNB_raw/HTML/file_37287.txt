<span class="headword">Clark,  Alfred Joseph</span>  (1885&#150;1941), <span class="occ">pharmacologist</span>, was born on 19 August 1885 in Northover, near Glastonbury, Somerset, the elder son and second of four children of Francis Joseph Clark, partner in C. and J. Clark Ltd (shoe manufacturers at Street, Somerset), and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Smithson. As with earlier generations of his Quaker family, his secondary education was at Bootham School, York. He entered King's College, Cambridge, in 1903, and gained first classes in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1905 and 1907). From childhood he had been fascinated by natural history, and at Cambridge he decided on a career which would enable him to combine medical research with his interest in comparative biology. To this end a medical degree was essential, and he undertook his clinical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where he again excelled. Once qualified (MB, 1910; MRCP, 1912; MD, 1914; FRCP, 1921), he began a career in pharmacological and physiological research which was interrupted only by service in both world wars. In December 1918 he was appointed professor of pharmacology at the University of Cape Town. In Cape Town he met his wife, Beatrix Powell (<i>d</i>. 1948), daughter of Robert William Hazell, medical practitioner in that city. They married in 1919 and had two sons and two daughters. From 1920 to 1926 he held the chair of pharmacology at University College, London. Then from 1926 until his death he was professor of materia medica at the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Clark made two key contributions to the development of pharmacology and hence medicine. The first was to establish that the primary effects of drugs on cells (here &#145;drug&#146; is used in its broader sense) are in principle fully understandable in terms of the known laws of physical and biological chemistry. This was achieved partly by a classical series of experiments to study the action of acetylcholine and atropine on their targets (receptors) in &#145;simple&#146; test objects such as the isolated heart of the frog, and partly by a painstaking and even-handed re-evaluation of the welter of information of very variable quality that was already available. The outcome was <span class="italic">The Mode of Action of Drugs on Cells</span> (1933) and an immensely influential monograph on general pharmacology (<span class="italic">Heffter's Handbuch der experimentellen Pharmakologie</span>, vol. 4, 1937). His work in this area greatly strengthened what can fairly be described as the British school of pharmacology, which is exemplified by Clark himself, and included Sir John Gaddum, H. O. Schild, and, later, R. P. Stephenson, William Paton, H. P. Rang, D. Colquhoun, and James Black. Its emphasis on careful measurement and exact analysis of the events mediated by receptors was to be justified by the key role this was to play in the subsequent development of novel drugs for the treatment of, for example, angina and hypertension.<br>
<br>A second major contribution was through Clark's textbook <span class="italic">Applied Pharmacology</span> (1923). This was characterized by its physiological and pathophysiological emphasis, by the inclusion of experimental evidence wherever possible, and by its quantitative approach. Clark had always loved computation, and a childhood estimation of the minimum possible capacity of Noah's ark foreshadowed his later demonstration in <span class="italic">Applied Pharmacology</span> that the preparation of some homoeopathic remedies involved dilutions of such order that there would be only one drug molecule in a volume of solution equal to that circumscribed by the orbit of the planet Neptune. New editions of <span class="italic">Applied Pharmacology</span> were prepared at regular intervals, first by Clark himself and then by his successors at University College, London.<br>
<br>Clark also served the wider scientific community, and the general public, by his influential membership of the Medical Research Council from 1934, and by his lifelong interest in the provision of safe and effective medication. The latter led him to publish a pungent tract on patent medicines. He was as vigorous physically as intellectually, and rowed for his college at Cambridge. Later he became a keen and accomplished mountaineer.<br>
<br>Clark was profoundly influenced by his service as a field medical officer in the First World War. He also served in the Second World War, becoming a lieutenant-colonel. His total and sometimes even austere commitment to the highest professional and personal standards can be understood in the context of that harrowing early experience. It was also the occasion of his resignation from the Society of Friends in 1917. His many honours included the award of the MC in 1917 and election to fellowship of the Royal Society in 1931. He became MRCPE in 1926 and FRSE in 1927. Clark died in Edinburgh on 30 July 1941, leaving a widow and four children. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102600/', "David Hazell Clarke (1920&#150;2010)")</script> was later an eminent psychiatrist.<br>
