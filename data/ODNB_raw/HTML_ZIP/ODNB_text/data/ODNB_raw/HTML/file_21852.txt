<span class="headword">Penn,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1878), <span class="occ">marine engineer</span>, the son of the engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21851/', "John Penn (1770&#150;1843)")</script>, was born at Greenwich, Kent, and was apprenticed to his father. At an early age he demonstrated remarkable aptitude for engineering&#151;in practical workmanship, design, and management&#151;and he soon joined his father in the management of the family business, later John Penn &amp; Sons. From 1825 to 1840 the work of father and son is almost impossible to disentangle. About 1826 the younger Penn constructed the steam gun invented by Jacob Perkins, which was shown to Wellington and other officers, taken to Paris, and later exhibited at the Adelaide Gallery, London. He was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1826, became a member in 1845, and served on the council from 1853 to 1856. In 1847 he married Ellen English, the daughter of another London engineer, William English of Enfield; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The most lucrative source of marine engine orders in this period was the Royal Navy. It tended to be conservative, and restricted orders to known, approved contractors. In 1843 Penn approached the Admiralty with an unsolicited offer to install high-power oscillating engines in the Admiralty steam yacht <i>Black Eagle</i>. This was accepted, on the recommendation of Sir John Rennie. The success of these engines led to Penn's installing further examples in many of the last paddle-wheel warships down to 1852. A modified version was fitted to the pioneer iron screw steamer the <i>Great Britain</i> in 1852, when she was converted for service on the Australian route; the power and economy of Penn's engines opened this route to steamships.<br>
<br>For naval screw propeller vessels Penn developed the trunk engine, which combined laid-down (that is, horizontal) cylinders for safety below the waterline with the highest power yet achieved. For two decades they were the engines of choice for new, high-powered British warships. The first of the type, designed to run at what were then considered very high speeds to drive the screw propeller directly, rather than relying on bulky and noisy gearing, was installed in the pioneer screw frigate <i>Arrogant</i> of 1848; the type was enlarged and improved for the first steam battleship the <i>Agamemnon</i> in 1852, the first ironclad, the <i>Warrior</i> of 1861, and the first mastless battleship, the <i>Devastation</i> of 1871. During the Crimean War Penn's works were also employed in erecting 120 small high-pressure engines for use in gunboats. They split this task with their major rivals, Maudslay, Son, and Field of Lambeth, leaving the casting of components to the smaller firms that shared the Thames riverside. These orders were secured by the excellent results that had been given by previous Penn engines, rather than by competitive tender, for it was widely recognized that the Royal Navy travelled first class and Penn's machinery was the best available. Penn engines, large and small, were noted for their high power, great reliability, and astonishing longevity. Those fitted to the early ironclads often served for more than thirty years, while the gunboat engines outlasted the craft in which they were first installed; many were reused in new vessels. Penn's own reputation was such that he was called in to arbitrate the quarrel between Isambard Kingdom Brunel and John Scott Russell over the <i>Great Eastern</i> in 1859.<br>
<br>Penn's works grew to meet the number and value of naval orders, leavened by a number of premium mercantile and liner contracts. By the time of his death it occupied 7 acres on Blackheath Hill, and there was a separate boiler works at Deptford. It was always considered the best-equipped marine engineering works, capable of meeting any demand. Penn was a model employer, one of the first to recognize the value of skilled employees through pensions, as well as the more typically paternalistic system of awarding Christmas gifts. His works also provided the education for a whole generation of marine engineers, and not a few naval officers, who took time to study there. In 1858&#150;9, and again in 1867&#150;8, Penn served as president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers; he contributed several papers to their <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>. In June 1859 he was elected FRS, and in 1860 he helped to found the Institution of Naval Architects.<br>
<br>Penn developed, improved, and refined the ideas and engineering of others, and was among the first to employ the precision instruments and tools developed by his friend Joseph Whitworth. His approach was empirical, and he devoted much time and effort to solving fundamental problems. His most important contribution to marine engineering came in collaboration with Francis Pettit Smith: the two men developed the <i>lignum vitae</i> stern bearing, patented in 1854 and finally perfected in 1858. This enabled screw propeller ships to make oceanic voyages without wearing out their stern glands. It was typical of Penn that he should contribute the least obvious, but most important, step in the creation of the modern ship.<br>
<br>In 1875 Penn, by then very ill, retired from the management of the business, which passed to his two elder sons, who had been partners since 1872. He died at his home, The Cedars, Lee, Kent, on 23 September 1878, survived by his wife, and was buried at St Margaret's Church, Lee, on 29 September. By the time of his death the firm had built engines for 735 ships, ranging from river ferries to battleships. His eldest son, John (1848&#150;1903), educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, managed the firm, but was not an engineer. He was Conservative MP for Lewisham from 1891 to 1903 and &#145;one of the best-known Parliamentary golfers&#146;  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>, 5/2, 1953, 84). The firm closed in 1914. John Penn was one of the giants of Victorian engineering, and was universally acknowledged as such in his lifetime. He deserves to be better known; his engines helped to maintain Britain's mastery of the seas for more than fifty years. As his friend John Bourne observed, he was an irreparable loss to the world of engineering: &#145;he produced engines such as no one else was able to equal or excel&#146;, while &#145;his merit was only excelled by his modesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Engineer</span>, 4 Oct 1878, 242).<br>
