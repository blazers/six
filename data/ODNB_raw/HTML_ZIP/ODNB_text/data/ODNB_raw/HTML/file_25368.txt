<span class="headword">Sheridan,  Thomas</span>  (1646&#150;1712), <span class="occ">government official and Jacobite pamphleteer</span>, was born at St John's, near Trim, co. Meath, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67233/', "Denis Sheridan")</script>, Church of Ireland clergyman, and an Englishwoman named Foster. Denis came of an old Irish family, but had been raised a protestant; of Thomas's brothers, Patrick became bishop of Cloyne and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25373/', "William Sheridan")</script> bishop of Kilmore. Thomas entered Trinity College, Dublin, in January 1661, graduated BA in 1664, and became a fellow in 1667. In June 1670 he entered the Middle Temple, but soon became involved in the Irish revenue administration and then in a variety of potentially lucrative projects. Early in 1678 he published, anonymously, <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Rise and Power of Parliaments</span>. It &#145;said little about parliament&#146;  (Hiller, 108), but Sheridan argued that England needed to maximize its economic potential to counter the threat from France. He denounced religious persecution as economically damaging; laws were needed against religious dissidents, but they should be lightly and sensitively enforced. He argued that Ireland too needed to modernize economically, which would require both freedom of trade and the replacement of the Gaelic language by English.<br>
<br>In his search for advancement Sheridan had gained the patronage of James, duke of York. This proved embarrassing during the exclusion crisis, and in December 1680 he was imprisoned and interrogated on suspicion of complicity in the Popish Plot. Released early in 1681, he embarked on a plan to farm the Irish revenue. In 1683 or 1684 he married Helen (<i>c</i>.1662&#150;1702), daughter of Thomas Appleby of Lynton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire, a Roman Catholic. Described as &#145;about forty&#146; when she died in 1702, she was already a widow when she married Sheridan; her first husband was called Ravenscroft. A son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25370/', "Thomas Sheridan")</script>, was born in 1684; two daughters and another son followed. When James II became king, Sheridan announced his conversion to Catholicism, days after the judges' decision in <i>Godden v. Hales</i> (June 1686) opened the way for Catholics to hold offices in England. James, however, had work for Sheridan in Ireland. He regarded Henry Hyde, earl of Clarendon, the lord lieutenant, as prejudiced against protestants, but feared that his Catholic rival, Richard Talbot, earl of Tyrconnell, was so anti-protestant as to cause anxiety among his English protestant subjects and harboured thoughts of separating Ireland from England after James's death. When James appointed Tyrconnell lord deputy in January 1687, in Clarendon's place, he appointed Sheridan his secretary and, later, first commissioner of the revenue. Sheridan proved no match for the formidable Tyrconnell; his complaints that Tyrconnell appointed and dismissed officials purely on religious grounds were countered by Tyrconnell with accusations of corruption. A hearing before a group of judges in Ireland upheld Tyrconnell's allegations and Sheridan was removed from his offices on 20 January 1688.<br>
<br>Sheridan followed James into exile in January 1689, determined to clear his name. He published an anti-Williamite pamphlet (widely ascribed to George Savile, marquess of Halifax) entitled <span class="italic">A Letter from a Nobleman in London to his Friend in the Country</span> (1690) and wrote several tracts which were not published. Whereas he had earlier advocated a measure of toleration and argued that religion should not influence appointments to office, his later tracts show him as both a bigoted Catholic and a forceful proponent of absolute monarchy. He saw James's religion as the sole reason for his expulsion and argued that there could be no compromising the one true faith. Such views were too extreme and intransigent for a king trying to woo his former subjects and the tracts were never published. He no longer claimed that the Gaels were inferior to the English, arguing that the Irish had been uniquely &#145;faithful&#146; to the Stuarts. He went on a diplomatic mission to the Palatinate in 1695, and in 1699 he was appointed a commissioner of the royal household. His &#145;Narrative&#146;, written in 1702, &#145;sheds valuable light on James II's Irish policy&#146;  (Hiller, 128). Sheridan died on 7/17 March 1712 at St Germain-en-Laye and was buried there.<br>
