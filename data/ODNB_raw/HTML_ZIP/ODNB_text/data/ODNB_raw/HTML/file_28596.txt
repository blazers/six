</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walpole,  Horatio <span class="st"> [Horace]</span></span>, fourth earl of Orford  (1717&#150;1797), <span class="occ">author, politician, and patron of the arts</span>, was born on 24 September 1717 at his father's house in Arlington Street, Piccadilly, Westminster. The father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28601/', "Robert Walpole, first earl of Orford (1676&#150;1745)")</script>, already a leading whig politician and on his way to becoming Britain's longest-serving prime minister. Though not of noble lineage, the family was of long standing in Norfolk, with a squirearchical estate to match. Walpole's mother, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shorter (<i>d</i>. 1737), came of mercantile stock, and was the granddaughter of a lord mayor of London and the daughter of a dealer in the Baltic trade. The union of county and counting-house was appropriate for a whig dynasty in the making.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears17171739"></a>Early years, 1717&#150;1739</h2>Horace, named after his father's brother and close political associate &#145;Old Horace&#146; [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28595/', "Walpole, Horatio, first Baron Walpole of Wolterton")</script>], was the late and last child of his parents' marriage. There is a story that he was the product of a liaison between Catherine Walpole and Carr, Lord Hervey, though no contemporary evidence exists to substantiate it, let alone any suggestion that Horace himself questioned his parentage. The innuendo originated with a recollection of Lady Louisa Stuart in the 1830s, which apparently derived from her grandmother Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Malice on either of their parts might explain it. Lady Louisa remembered Walpole as &#145;my old ill-natured friend&#146;  (J. A. Home, ed., <span class="italic">Letters of Lady Louisa Stuart to Miss Louisa Clinton</span>, 1901, 252).<br>
<br>The child was sickly and much cherished by his mother, whose domestic life was narrowed by her husband's absences with his mistress Maria Skerrett on his Norfolk estate at Houghton and in his hunting-lodge in Richmond Park. She dwelled mainly in Arlington Street, and during the summer at the family villa in Chelsea, where much of the young Horace's time was spent. Through his aunt Dorothy Walpole the family was allied to another Norfolk family, the Townshends of Rainham. Horace's early education was received among his Townshend cousins, whose tutor was Edward Weston, son of the bishop of Exeter.<br>
<br>In April 1727 the boy was sent to Eton College, his father's school. There the rough and tumble of a boarding-school apparently passed him by. Perhaps being the son of the prime minister protected him. In any event, his own experience contrasted with that of others at this time who recalled their schooldays at Eton as being more bruising. The mature Walpole's characteristic self-assurance was already well developed during these years, owing something, no doubt, to his insulated, cosseted upbringing under his mother's eye. He proved adept at forming protective affinities at school, mostly with boys of less favoured families. Of these the most notable was the so-called &#145;quadruple alliance&#146;, made up of Walpole, Thomas Gray, Thomas Ashton, and Richard West. Walpole's three associates were all impecunious, all had literary inclinations, and all joined in their fashionable friend's wistful musings and romantic evocations among Etonian shades and springs.<br>
<br>Other friends were made during these years, some of them long-lasting: Walpole's cousins Frances and Henry Seymour Conway, George Selwyn, later MP and colourful man about town, Charles Lyttelton, eventually bishop of Carlisle, the genial and indolent George Montagu, and William Cole, an enduring if unlikely friend as a tory clergyman and antiquarian.<br>
<br>Walpole left Eton in September 1734, and commenced at King's College, Cambridge, in March 1735, Gray and Ashton having preceded him by a few months. There he proved a poor mathematician but seems to have done better at other subjects. Among senior members of the university he met Conyers Middleton, whose heterodox writings had made him notorious even in a time and place of some theological latitude. It is often said that Walpole's lifelong religious scepticism owed something to this connection. There is no evidence that he read widely enough to ground it in his own studies.<br>
<br>The Cambridge years incidentally brought Walpole somewhat closer to his father. In the summer of 1736 he set foot in Sir Robert's palatial mansion recently completed at Houghton. Remarkably, this was Horace's first encounter with his Norfolk roots. In August 1737 Lady Walpole died, the severest personal loss that Horace had suffered or would ever suffer. His father displayed little emotion, and married his mistress Maria Skerrett soon after. But within a year of the first wife's death, the second died in childbirth, deeply afflicting Sir Robert and making any attention bestowed by his youngest son all the more welcome.<br>
<br>The young Walpole attained his majority in 1738, the year in which he finally left Cambridge, after increasingly erratic appearances there. A legal career had been talked of, but his father saved him the trouble of acquiring a profession or finding a remunerated vocation. Three sinecure revenue offices that he was granted at this time he held for life: usher of the exchequer, comptroller of the pipe, and clerk of the estreates.<br>
<br>For a young man of means and no duties the continental tour beckoned. Walpole invited Gray to accompany him. Despite its closeness, their friendship was ill-adapted to a travelling companionship. Gray had no resources of his own and could not but feel the inequality. Moreover, his proneness to melancholy and propensity to criticize could be hard to bear. On the other hand, Walpole's already characteristic capacity to combine personal detachment with emotional exploitation could inflict hurt. Later in life he generously recalled, &#145;We had not got to Calais before Gray was dissatisfied, for I was a boy, and he, though infinitely more a man, was not enough so to make allowances&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 28.114).<h2>
<a name="Grandtour17391741"></a>Grand tour, 1739&#150;1741</h2>Walpole and Gray left Dover at Easter 1739. Two months were spent in Paris, where they learned the first lesson of all grand tourists, that it was easier to pass time with other travellers than with the natives. Gray seems to have been the more adaptable, perhaps because he was more absorbed by what he observed than preoccupied with those he expected to meet. Even so, the variety of amusements and sights in Paris was such that neither could claim to be disappointed.<br>
<br>On retreating to Rheims to improve their French, Walpole and Gray found a quiet provincial city with little to detain them. They moved south in September, were charmed by the superior manners of Dijon and Lyons, and exhilarated by a foray into the Alps which included a visit to the Grande Chartreuse. &#145;We stayed there two hours, rode back through this charming picture, wished for a painter, wished to be poets!&#146; Walpole reported to West  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 13.182).<br>
<br>After Lyons they expected to winter in the south of France, but Walpole's father encouraged them to move on to Italy, perhaps with a view to the worsening diplomatic climate. The travellers accordingly pressed on, enduring a disagreeable crossing of the Alps, pausing briefly in Turin (where they met one of Walpole's Etonian contacts, the earl of Lincoln), and making for Florence, where they arrived shortly before Christmas 1739. As elsewhere on their journeying, Gray relished the exposure to the legacies of Rome and the Renaissance more than his companion did. Walpole threw himself into the social life of Florence.<br>
<br>It might not have been so if Walpole had not had an ideal master of ceremonies. The British minister to the court of Tuscany, Horace Mann, was doubtless polite to the son of the prime minister, but at the age of thirty-eight might not have expected to strike up a close friendship with his young charges. Yet the three became genuinely close friends. In due course Mann was to be prominent in that <i>tableau vivant</i> of personal correspondents that Walpole constructed around himself when he returned to Britain. No less significant was his meeting with John Chute, a younger son who unexpectedly succeeded to the family estate at The Vyne in Hampshire, and was in due course to bring his artistic ability and interest in classical design to his new friend's aid.<br>
<br>From February to July 1740 Gray and Walpole were in Rome, to observe the eternal city in the throes of a papal election. This proved less engrossing than expected, though Walpole dutifully inspected classical sites, collected medals, and observed the activities of James Stuart (the Pretender) and his court, at a time when Jacobite hopes had been raised by the gathering clouds of a great European war. After tiring of Rome (in Walpole's case if not Gray's) the travellers returned to the routine they had established in Florence. Their friendship did not survive the tour. They left Florence together but parted company at Reggio in May 1741. The precise cause is obscure. Attempts to repair the breach, aided from a distance by Mann, failed and Gray made his own way home, assisted by clandestine grants from Walpole so that the source of the funds remained unknown. By then Walpole himself had come close to death at Reggio. He went down with a severe &#145;quinsy&#146; which would have gone uncured but for the arrival of Lincoln and his tutor Joseph Spence, and the medical intervention they arranged. Walpole accompanied Lincoln's party to Venice, and thence via Genoa, Antibes (by sea), and Paris, arriving in London on 14 September 1741.<br>
<br>The emotional significance of the tour in Walpole's life has been much discussed, and not only in relation to Gray. Before Italy, Walpole had expressed a passing tenderness for his cousin Anne Conway. At Florence, in tune with local manners, he became <i>cicisbeo</i> to the wife of the Marchese Grifoni, Elisabetta Capponi. If he ever slept with any woman, it was the Grifoni. Walpole was to have a number of close but ambiguous relationships with women. Not only did he tend to avoid genuine commitment; he left considerable pain in his wake when he retreated. This was certainly the case with the Grifoni, who wept for him long after he had pretended to spare a thought for her. Even so, their relationship must have affected his understanding of his own feelings. Visiting aristocrats were accustomed to take advantage of the sexual permissiveness of Italian society. If Walpole did not avail himself of the opportunity, he was a less than typical English tourist.<br>
<br>Some men had the power to hurt Walpole as women perhaps did not. Anne Conway's brother Henry Conway was one such, perhaps because he was a tangible link with his own mother (Conway's mother was her sister). Conway had been one of Walpole's circle after Eton, and was in France with him in 1740. Another young man whose Italian paths crossed Walpole's was the red-blooded young Lord Lincoln.<br>
<br>There is a temptation to suppose that men of more evident masculinity than Walpole figured in his sexual aspirations and perhaps activities. It has even been suggested that the whole of his purpose during his tour had been to engineer recurrent assignations with Lincoln as his lover  (Mowl, chaps. 3&#150;4). This theory requires much deception on behalf of a number of parties, not only Walpole but also Lincoln himself and his tutor Joseph Spence. It leaves unexplained why Walpole did not always linger where Lincoln was, for example in Turin in 1740. Above all it turns his sexual ambivalence, which must remain a matter for speculation, into a consummated passion for one highly heterosexual young man whose conduct did not suggest anything like a corresponding commitment. In these matters it is easy to be misled by Walpole's epistolary language, which was sometimes extravagant but not beyond the conventions of the day among the <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i>. Still less exceptional was the sexual banter common among aristocratic young men, especially those educated at public school.<h2>
<a name="Walpolianpolitics17411755"></a>Walpolian politics, 1741&#150;1755</h2>Walpole's return brought him close once more to his father. The two shared homes in Downing Street, Arlington Street, and the great mansion at Houghton. Horace spent three successive summers at Houghton, revelling in the grandeur that the scion of a family of squires had conjured into stone and plaster. He also tried out his analytical skills as a connoisseur on the collection of old masters that his father had assembled. In 1742 he composed a <span class="italic">Sermon on Painting</span> that was preached by his father's chaplain. A year later he completed his <span class="italic">Aedes Walpolianae</span>, a methodically constructed catalogue preceded by some extravagant and often dismissive judgements. It was later privately printed in 1747 and reissued in a revised edition in 1752.<br>
<br>In addition to making himself familiar with the contents of Houghton, Walpole seems to have enacted a passable imitation of a country gentleman, with expeditions to neighbouring establishments including, somewhat further afield, his uncle's home at Wolterton, and hare coursing in the country around. These last sojourns with his father brought him close to the manes Walpoliani and provided vivid memories to the end of his life. But he remained a town dweller whose rural retreats were never too far from St James's Square and carefully constructed to his own design.<br>
<br>In another of his father's ruling passions, politics, Horace did more than dabble. Even while making his way back to Britain in the summer of 1741 he had been elected MP for Callington in Cornwall. The seat was effectively owned by the Rolle family, into which his eldest brother had married, and though the new legislator sat for it until 1754, he never needed to pay his constituents a visit. Walpole's first session witnessed the last, tumultuous phase of his father's ministerial career, fought with characteristic tenacity against opponents who after many years of unavailing pursuit now smelled blood. Horace shared the strain of this struggle and helped provide solace when the premier retreated to Arlington Street. He also took pride in the latter's dignified retirement to the Lords, the continuing credit he enjoyed at court, and, especially after his death in 1745, a gathering public reaction in favour of a man whom his successors soon made it easy to recall with respect. These were turbulent years which witnessed growing discontent with the Hanoverian foreign policy of the new ministry, and in due course a revival of the Jacobite threat and the rising of 1745. Of all these things the son was a fascinated observer and astute narrator.<br>
<br>As a participant, Walpole was no more than moderately active. He appears to have spoken only once during his first two parliamentary sessions, on 23 March 1742, against a motion for a secret committee of inquiry into his father's administration. He spoke again on 18 January 1744 for government, seconding a motion on the employment of Hanoverian troops. It included a courtly Latin compliment on the valour of George II at Dettingen, and attracted &#145;deserved applause from everybody&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1715&#150;54</span>, 2.511). But this was a set piece which he would have had ample time to prepare. The cut and thrust of daily debate required qualities which he did not possess. He lacked the presence, the voice, and the combative instinct that made for success in the eighteenth-century House of Commons. Its roughness, familiarity, and practical business-mindedness were all rather alien to him.<br>
<br>Walpole's politics were shaped by what he took to be the opinions of his father and those of his father's followers who had not been implicated in his downfall in 1742. The leader of these was Henry Fox, around whom there congregated a group of young whigs that included several on close social as well as political terms with Horace: George Selwyn, George James (&#145;Gilly&#146;) Williams, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, Richard Edgcumbe, and Richard Rigby. Between 1742 and 1746 struggles at court established Henry Pelham and his brother the duke of Newcastle in power and quelled those who had opposed the Walpole regime in the 1730s and briefly triumphed in 1742. Pelham was the obvious heir to Sir Robert Walpole, but the whigs closest to Horace showed signs of restlessness under Pelhamite rule. They believed that Newcastle had treacherously intrigued against their leader in 1742. They also found Henry Pelham's cultivation of the moderate tories objectionable. Walpole fully shared these convictions.<br>
<br>On his re-election to parliament in 1747 Walpole was still considered a friend of government. In reality he secretly supported the new opposition launched by Frederick, prince of Wales. He wrote a number of anonymous articles for the press. Two of these, masquerading as &#145;speeches&#146; delivered in the Commons, arose from a political dispute in Buckinghamshire, where the Grenville family sought to disable their principal opponent in the county, Lord Chief Justice Willes, by seeking an act of parliament moving the assizes and with them much political power from Aylesbury to the Grenville stronghold at Buckingham. Walpole seems to have been moved solely by sympathy with Willes on account of the latter's long-standing friendship with Sir Robert Walpole. One unfortunate result was an unseemly altercation with his father's old friend the speaker, Arthur Onslow, for which Walpole was compelled to apologize.<br>
<br>A further excursion into print found Walpole attacking the Pelhams more directly, though again without revealing his identity. <span class="italic">Delenda est Oxonia</span>, defending Oxford against ministerial plans to remove the university's independence of the crown, was intercepted at the printer's before publication. This clandestine warfare did not prevent the author also wooing the Pelhams. On several occasions between 1751 and 1758 he sought to improve his income from the sinecure places that he and his brother enjoyed, all in vain. Throughout this period he was nominally a supporter in government. Yet his secret intrigues did not cease and included, in December 1752, an easily discredited depiction of the arrangements made for the education of the future George III as part of a plot to restore the Stuart government. In the pattern of politics that he had settled into on his father's death it is hard to see anything more than inherited prejudices and personal interest, combined with a tendency to mischievous intrigue.<h2>
<a name="Homeandfriends17451760"></a>Home and friends, 1745&#150;1760</h2>Walpole's inheritance from his father was the lease of the town house in Arlington Street, cash to the value of &pound;5000, and revenues of approximately &pound;1400 from the collectorship of the customs held by his brother Edward. These sums were additional to the sinecures that he held in his own right. His overall income from public sources was not less than &pound;3000 per annum and was to increase over the years through no effort of his own. He never thought these perquisites incompatible with self-consciously high-minded whiggism, even fancied republicanism.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1746 Walpole found a congenial substitute for his escapes to Houghton in a small house at Windsor, close enough to the metropolis to ensure that the <i>longueurs</i> of rural life were never more than half a day's ride from town. In the following spring a more permanent solution was found when he bought the leasehold of a somewhat unpromising house in Twickenham with 5 acres of Thameside scenery. In due course the leasehold became freehold and the 5 acres became 14.<br>
<br>Strawberry Hill gave its name to a whole genre of Gothic revival that has had a variable press since Walpole's &#145;committee of taste&#146; transformed it into a &#145;little Gothic castle&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.111). The committee comprised, in addition to Walpole himself, his antiquarian friend John Chute and the dilettante Richard Bentley, son of Richard Bentley, the classical scholar and master of Trinity College, Cambridge. Bentley was valued by Walpole not only because, as he observed, &#145;his drawings and architecture are admirable&#146;, but also because he &#145;to all the ornament of learning has the amiable turn of mind, disposition and wit&#146;  (ibid., 16.25). He proved an at times irritating colleague, but his creativity was critical to the realization of Walpole's vision. Between 1750 and 1753, when Bentley withdrew to Jersey to protect himself from his creditors, the appearance of the house at Twickenham was transformed, though much of the early work was superficial rather than structural. Battlements and arched windows altered the appearance without radically affecting the overall layout. The one major exception at this stage was the newly designed staircase and hall, the latter monastically &#145;decked with long saints in lean arched windows and with taper columns, which we call the Paraclete, in memory of Eloisa's cloister&#146;  (ibid., 20.372).<br>
<br>Thereafter, in 1754 new rooms were added, the refectory or great parlour, and Strawberry Hill's most remarkable chamber, its library. It was begun by Bentley (who supplied Walpole with a deputy, the German painter John Henry M&uuml;ntz), but completed by Walpole and Chute, and triumphantly finished with bookcases and a chimney-piece derived from medieval tombs in the original St Paul's, Westminster Abbey, and Canterbury Cathedral. Walpole's pride in his ancestry was displayed in a variety of details in the house, but nowhere so exuberantly as in the library, where the ceiling displayed the arms of the families with which he was allied.<br>
<br>Strawberry Hill bears no resemblance to Houghton, but it was to Horace what Houghton had been to Sir Robert, with due allowance for their respective resources. It complemented an urban lifestyle, providing an outlet for energies that could not be released in town, and above all created a satisfying picture of the way Walpole wished to be perceived by others. In their different ways both Houghton and Strawberry Hill were daring and imaginative projects, designed to leave a permanent public monument to their owners.<br>
<br>This is not to say that Walpole lost his attachment to Houghton. In 1751, when his brother the second earl of Orford died, he did his best to engineer a marriage between the heir, his nephew George, and an heiress acquainted with his friend Chute, Margaret Nicoll. The plan was complicated by the intervention of Walpole's uncle &#145;Old Horace&#146;, who thought the match more appropriate for one of his own sons, and wrecked altogether when George himself rebelled on account of an unfavourable report of Miss Nicoll's looks and temper. The Horaces quarrelled bitterly and irretrievably, and the third earl of Orford retreated into a life of increasing eccentricity and, eventually, evident insanity.<br>
<br>Walpole's personal relationships gradually settled into a pattern during the years that followed his father's death. In November 1745 a lasting reconciliation with Gray took place, for reasons which remain obscure. West had died in June 1742. With Ashton, who plainly viewed their connection as a means of personal advancement, relations grew cooler until Horace irrevocably parted company in 1750. Some of the young politicians with whom he consorted became close associates as his &#145;out-of-town party&#146; at Twickenham in the 1750s: Selwyn, Williams, and Edgcumbe.<br>
<br>As for women, the Grifoni was consigned to oblivion. There were hints in some verse that Walpole wrote in 1746&#151;&#145;The Beauties&#146;&#151;of another female attachment, Elizabeth Evelyn. It must have been at most a passing affectation of sexual ambition. Four years later she married into the Bathurst family. On the other hand, Walpole gradually acquired a reputation as a collector of ladies whose friendship nobody could mistake for sexual attraction, though with them he was prone to employ a gently ironic language of gallantry that became highly characteristic. In some cases he appreciated them as living memoirs for the historian of recent times. Lady Suffolk, at Marble Hill, had been the mistress of George II and somewhat ineffectual opponent of Sir Robert Walpole and Queen Caroline. Lady Hervey, once, as Molly Leppell, the toast of St James's and now widow of Robert Walpole's confidant Lord Hervey, was herself another repository of anecdote about an era that fascinated Walpole. Others were women of influence and wit in the high society of the day: such were Etheldreda, Lady Townshend, and Anne Pitt, sister of William Pitt the elder.<br>
<br>Other exhibits in Walpole's feminine gallery were less likely, among them Kitty Clive, the actress he encountered as a neighbour in Twickenham and installed in a small house near Strawberry Hill. Her infectious gaiety and direct manner made her a surprising social asset as well as an engaging neighbour. Another incongruous friend was Lady Mary Coke, relict of an unconsummated marriage, and ridiculed for her pursuit of the royal duke of York. With her Walpole adopted a flirtatious manner that made some suspect that he was smitten with her. A further female connection that was to strengthen over the years and continue until Walpole's death was Anne Liddell, successively duchess of Grafton and, after her divorce in 1769, countess of Upper Ossory. Almost all of these women not only helped people his private correspondence but themselves became correspondents of his at one time or another.<br>
<br>The rhythm of Walpole's life was predictable as well as agreeable: winters in town, summers for the most part at Strawberry Hill, each with its own cast of players, sometimes overlapping. By the mid-1750s the range of his activities provided him with all that suited him and made an admirable substitute for the political career to which he might once have aspired. Aside from the gout that began to afflict him in the mid-1750s there was little to disrupt his chosen mode of life. In these years at least, its centre of human interest was in Arlington Street. &#145;My jaunts to town will prevent my news from being quite provincial and marvellous&#146;, he had written to Mann during his Windsor sojourn in 1746 and the pattern was the same once he had acquired Strawberry Hill  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.298). Balls and masquerades, opera and theatre, Ranelagh and Vauxhall, dinners, galas and routs, weddings and funerals, all appear with a vividness that could only come from the pen of an ironic spectator who also an enthusiastic participant. Anecdotes of &#145;politesse anglaise&#146; abound, recording &#145;excellent vulgarisms&#146;, &#145;terrible disgrazie&#146;, and a vast diversity of social contretemps, all with malice enough to lend spice to the story but without sourness or more than a trace of detached superiority.<h2>
<a name="Historianauthorandpublisher17461764"></a>Historian, author, and publisher, 1746&#150;1764</h2>Walpole saw himself as the historian of his own times, though he insisted in characteristically self-deprecating fashion that what he wrote were &#145;casual memoirs&#146; for use by &#145;my superiors the historians of Britain&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">George II</span>, xxxi). The letters to Mann, addressed to one who had been &#145;absent long enough to read of your own country as history&#146; provided the obvious foundations for his work  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.403). Walpole later stated that he had begun his history in 1751 and certainly what is known to posterity as <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Last Ten Years of the Reign of George II</span> commenced in that year, but he had first asked Mann to return his letters in September 1748. Earlier still Gray was aware of a plan to compose &#145;M&eacute;moires&#146;, assuring Walpole that &#145;posterity will ever be glad to know the absurdity of their ancestors&#146;  (ibid., 14.9, 13). A draft of this earlier attempt is extant, though unpublished.<br>
<br>Mann, who could be expected to take an interest in the doings of politicians but not necessarily in other matters, was not the only recipient of materials for the memoirs. George Montagu was regaled with London's social life, a role that was eventually taken over by the countess of Upper Ossory. Each was familiar with the class whose doings Walpole described but somewhat removed from immediate knowledge of them, the first because he rarely came to town, the second as a divorcee excluded from high society. Most of Walpole's major correspondents occupied a specialist niche in his personal gallery that provided a living and retrievable repository for his opinions, researches, and activities. Literary matters were discussed with Gray, and after his death, with William Mason. William Cole, whom Walpole had known at Eton, came to perform the same function for antiquarian topics. This pigeonholing of his friends and almost clinical replacing of them as they died or disappeared from his ken was essential to his personal project. As a contemporary historian, Walpole treated his own letters as his sourcebooks.<br>
<br>Walpole also engaged with the earlier history of his country. His grand tour did not give him a lasting interest in classical antiquity or indeed the Renaissance, notwithstanding the interest in high art that his father's collection had helped inculcate. By 1752 he could write, &#145;I have done with virtu, and deal only with the Goths and Vandals&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.144). His patriotic instincts combined with the accessibility of the English past to lead him into the architectural highways and byways of medieval culture. (Its literary inheritance he was less learned in, with unfortunate results when he encountered Thomas Chatterton.) Initially, with Chute he conducted &#145;Gothic pilgrimages&#146; that brought much information and insight. For one source he acquired a particular veneration. In Oxford he found &#145;what remains of the true Gothic <i>un-Gibbs'd</i>&#146; and delighted in &#145;the profusion of painted glass&#146;  (ibid., 35.155). This is not to say that he venerated the residents. As he later told Lady Upper Ossory, his regard was for &#145;the buildings, not the wretched oafs that inhabit it&#146;  (ibid., 33.483).<br>
<br>Of his social connections Walpole took maximum advantage. His &#145;Journals of country seats&#146;, not published until the twentieth century, provide a meticulous record of his visits, which combined congenial company with close inspection of buildings and monuments. From not a few he came away with ornaments to decorate his own home. His spoliation of stained glass was unashamed and not excused by the fact that it took the form of authorized gifts or unauthorized sales. On the other hand he strongly opposed the destruction that occurred sometimes when &#145;a spirit of restoration and decoration has taken place&#146;, as when Wyatt's work on Salisbury Cathedral resulted in the demolition of its Beauchamp and Hungerford chapels  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 42.259).<br>
<br>In due course this antiquarian investment proved productive. In the meantime there were literary activities of various kinds. In 1748 some of Walpole's poems had been published in Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span>. Two years later, having inadvertently permitted Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy in a Country Churchyard</span> to be pirated from a manuscript version that he had circulated among his friends, he undertook to see the authorized version through the press. He then persuaded Gray to allow publication of his remaining poems in an edition illustrated by Bentley. Managing the temperaments of author and illustrator was no small task, but in March 1753 the elegant, rococo result was <span class="italic">Designs by Mr. R. Bentley, for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray</span>.<br>
<br>At the same time Walpole began publishing on his own account in a new essay periodical, <span class="italic">The World</span>, contributing a small number of well-regarded papers on diverse cultural and contemporary themes. Not the least interesting to posterity is an ironic essay on old women as satisfactory objects for love. More explicitly drawing on personal experience was his piece on the politeness of highwaymen, resulting from a brush in November 1749 with the celebrated James Maclaine (Maclean). In June 1757 his literary ambitions impelled Walpole in a new direction with the establishment of a printing press at Strawberry Hill. The first production was of two odes from Gray's hand. Neither the publicity that attended its launch nor the critical reception of <span class="italic">The Progress of Poesy</span> and <span class="italic">The Bard</span> pleased the hypersensitive Gray. Other volumes soon followed: an account of England in 1598 by the German Paul Hentzner, and in April 1758 Walpole's own <span class="italic">A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England, with Lists of their Works</span>, a work which displayed the characteristic strengths and weaknesses of his brand of amateur antiquarianism. The latter brought some discomfiture. His scholarly errors were discussed in public and private, and his markedly whig bias gave much offence.<br>
<br>The productions of the press included some notable coups. One was the first printing of <span class="italic">The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Written by Himself</span> in 1764, achieved only after some persuasion had been required to convince its owner, Lord Powis, that his ancestor's exploits could be revealed without exposing the family to ridicule. Much else was to follow over the years, including a number of Walpole's own writings. <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces in Verse and Prose</span>, dedicated to Conway, had appeared in 1758. By this time he was working on his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting in England</span>: two volumes appeared in 1762 and a third, together with his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Engravers</span> in 1764. It had something in common with his <span class="italic">Royal and Noble Authors</span>, offering list and commentary in accessible and amusing dress. But it was to live longer, mainly because it was based on materials which Walpole had purchased from the widow of the engraver George Vertue in 1758. He had known Vertue himself since 1743 and perhaps owed something of his evolving interest in English portraiture to his knowledgeable encouragement. The &#145;forty volumes of his MS. Collection relating to English painters, sculptors, gravers, and architects&#146; amply justified Walpole's claim that they contained &#145;an infinite quantity of new and curious things&#146;. Later in life he described the <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span> as &#145;the only thing I ever published of any use&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.574).<h2>
<a name="Gothicextravagances17501768"></a>Gothic extravagances, 1750&#150;1768</h2>Further work on Strawberry Hill had to take account of some personal awkwardnesses. M&uuml;ntz was dismissed in 1759, having annoyed his employer by his &#145;airs and insolence&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.260) and his seduction of one of the maids. More distressing still, there came a breach with Bentley in 1761, ascribed partly to Bentley's unbusinesslike habits, partly to Mrs Bentley's presumptuous manners. On the credit side, Walpole gained a new assistant in the shape of the elder Pitt's nephew Thomas Pitt, a new resident of Twickenham. There were major new projects in hand for Strawberry Hill which were to double the size of the house. His Holbein chamber, decorated with tracings of Holbeins in the Royal Collection, was finished in 1759. More ambitiously, there rose up a cloister with gallery above, the latter constituting Walpole's <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i>, a careful execution of variations on a perpendicular Gothic theme combined with sumptuous gold and crimson furnishings, and filled with the owner's most prized possessions. Later came the Round Tower, overlooking the road to Hampton, and a chapel or cabinet intended emphatically for the display of secular treasures rather than devotional purposes. These additions were largely complete by 1763.<br>
<br>Soon after, Walpole published (though not from his own press) <span class="italic">The Castle of Otranto: a Story</span>, advertised as the translation, by one &#145;William Marshal, Gent&#146;, of an Italian work discovered in the library of an old Roman Catholic family in the north of England. Considering its contents this disguise was understandable, though in the event the reception was so favourable that within six months of publication he was issuing a second edition in which his authorship was revealed.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Otranto</span>, set in medieval Naples, in an imaginary castle of whose actual existence Walpole was unaware until long after publication, was a wholly unbelievable tale, but its atmospheric power easily made up for its thin characterization. Impressive theatrical effects included a gigantic heavenly helmet with magical powers, a bleeding statue, a sword that could only be borne by fifty men, an anchorite whose flesh had melted away to leave only an animated skeleton, and a portrait that strode out of its frame. The fascination with the fantastic was the same that created Strawberry Hill, but unrestrained by the requirements of bricks and mortar. It caught a tide of interest in exotic evocations of ancient and medieval cultures. Later Walpole observed, more self-deprecatingly than was necessary:<blockquote>It was fit for nothing but the age in which it was written, an age in which much was known; that required only to be amused, nor cared whether its amusements were conformable to truth and the models of good sense; that could not be spoiled; was in no danger of being too credulous; and rather wanted to be brought back to imagination, than to be led astray by it. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 31.221)</blockquote>Medievalism had a firm grip on Walpole by this time. Three years after <span class="italic">Otranto</span> he published his <span class="italic">Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third</span>, another work not initially printed at Strawberry Hill. It enjoyed considerable success, re-igniting public interest in the ancient controversy surrounding the murder of the princes in the Tower. Walpole was an uncompromising Ricardian. There were several ripostes, the most damaging from Jeremiah Milles, the president of the Society of Antiquaries, who demolished the principal documentary evidence. Though Walpole did not reply in print, this hurt was sufficient for him to resign his membership of the society in due course.<br>
<br>While composing the <span class="italic">Historic Doubts</span>, Walpole was also working on a blank verse drama entitled <span class="italic">The Mysterious Mother</span>. It was published at Strawberry Hill in a limited edition of fifty copies in 1768. The feeling of his friends was that, however well it might be done, it had better not have been done at all. The story, set in pre-Reformation Narbonne, was of the unintentional double incest of a young man who had been seduced by his mother masquerading as a servant and eventually married her daughter by him. What it revealed about Walpole's personal insecurities may be debated. It certainly allowed him to trail his anti-Romish prejudices by giving a repulsive friar the responsibility for malevolently arranging the marriage.<h2>
<a name="Politics17571765"></a>Politics, 1757&#150;1765</h2>The passion that sustained <span class="italic">Otranto</span>, the <span class="italic">Historic Doubts</span>, and <span class="italic">Mysterious Mother</span> perhaps had its origin in the emotional turmoil that Walpole experienced at this time. This grand climacteric was the result of a personal commitment to a political cause far beyond any that he had made before or was to make again. Since the mid-1750s Walpole had been adrift of his political moorings. It was inevitable that a man whose sole political principle was adherence to the memory, measures, and friends of his father would in time find the last of these increasingly difficult to comprehend. Clandestine opposition to Newcastle and Pelham had been justified on the grounds that both had supposedly helped to bring Sir Robert down. But when followers of his father cast their lot definitively with the Pelhams, as Fox did in 1755, it was less easy to reconcile past principles and present practice. Walpole's response was characteristically ambivalent. On the one hand he made it clear to Fox how deeply he resented his conduct. On the other he published in <span class="italic">The World</span> in 1757 a &#145;character&#146; of Fox written some years before that was almost embarrassingly eulogistic. At the same time he turned increasingly to Henry Seymour Conway, who developed a political as well as military career when in 1754 he became chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, conventionally a stepping-stone to a higher office.<br>
<br>Walpole himself took a step of some consequence when in 1757 the electors of King's Lynn, once represented by Sir Robert, more recently by &#145;Old Horace&#146; and his son, sought his candidature. King's Lynn, with its still thriving trade and turbulent politics, was very different from Callington, which he represented from 1741 to 1754, and Castle Rising, another close borough for which he sat between 1754 and 1757. With some trepidation he accepted the call, presented himself in the constituency (a novel experience for him), and remained member without controversy until his retirement from parliament in 1768. He left a memorable account of his part in popular elections in a letter to Montagu about his &#145;new vocation&#146;:<blockquote>Think of me, the subject of a mob, who was scarce ever before in a mob! Addressing them in the town-hall, riding at the head of two thousand people through such a town as Lynn, dining with above two hundred of them amid bumpers, huzzas, songs and tobacco, and finishing with country dances at a ball and six-penny whisk! (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.350)</blockquote>Walpole's brief absence from the Commons, after his resignation of Castle Rising and before his re-election for King's Lynn, coincided with the loss of Minorca and what looked the judicial murder of Admiral Byng as the scapegoat. Walpole became incensed by the case, helped postpone the final outcome, and deplored Byng's execution when it took place. His fury was unleashed in an icily ironic little tract, <span class="italic">A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher at London, at his Friend Lien Chi, at Peking</span>, exposing the absurdity of a political system that condemned an admiral for decisions made by his political masters. The episode completed his disenchantment with Fox, who had been one of the most active of Byng's detractors.<br>
<br>The Seven Years' War brought Conway's military career once more to the fore, initially with unfortunate results as second in command of the disastrous Rochefort expedition of 1757. Eventually he more than regained his reputation with the British forces in Germany, watched from afar by Walpole with anxious admiration. At home Walpole admired Pitt, continued to detest Newcastle, and observed the accession of George III in 1760 and the elevation of his favourite Lord Bute, like a &#145;satisfied spectator&#146;, as he later admitted  (Walpole, <span class="italic">George III</span>, 1.167). One of the instruments of the new regime was Henry Fox, whose irritation with his old friend culminated in the spiteful gesture of slowing down the payments due to Walpole for his exchequer office. Insult was added to injury when Bute awarded the reversion of the office to a supporter who had acted as Fox's agent in the transaction.<br>
<br>Bute's successor, George Grenville, was a whig of conventional mould who quickly ruined himself in Walpole's eyes by prosecuting John Wilkes for an alleged libel on the king through the use of a &#145;general warrant&#146;, considered by many whigs an arbitrary and potentially tyrannical procedure. By this time Conway was again pursuing his peacetime career as a loyal supporter of government, but rebelled at the persecution of Wilkes, voting repeatedly against the use of general warrants. The response of the ministry was firm. Conway was dismissed from both the command of his regiment and his place as groom of the bedchamber.<br>
<br>Walpole's behaviour at this time startled both friends and enemies. He blamed himself for Conway's downfall, and laboured frantically to have him and his friends restored to office. When the ministry commissioned a defence of its actions in the form of William Guthrie's <span class="italic">Address to the Public on the Late Dismissal of a General Officer</span>, Walpole replied with a <span class="italic">Counter Address</span> that in turn provoked a riposte, the <span class="italic">Reply to the Counter Address</span>. In it Guthrie resorted to brutal tactics, fastening on his antagonist's supposed effeminacy, likening him to a &#145;hermaphrodite horse&#146; and attributing his animus to the &#145;unsuccessful passion during the course of twenty years&#146; that he had nourished for Conway. To Conway, Walpole reacted robustly:<blockquote>They have nothing better to say than that I am in love with you, have been so these twenty years, and am no giant. I am a very constant old swain: they might have made the years above thirty; it is so long I have had the same unalterable friendship for you, independent of being near relations and bred up together. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 38.437)</blockquote>The political crisis of 1764&#150;5 was resolved by a palace revolution that had nothing to do with Wilkes and general warrants. The upshot, however, was favourable to the whigs, displacing Grenville and putting in his place the old Newcastle party, led by Lord Rockingham and featuring Conway as secretary of state and leader of the House of Commons. This should have been the moment of triumph, but for Walpole it apparently became one of the most profound humiliation. No reward for his own activities was offered by the new government, nor any arrangement that might prevent any further political meddling with his official salary. The ingratitude on Conway's part appalled him. Privately he retreated into stoical resignation. &#145;His temper hurt me, but I forgave his virtue, of which I am confident, and know it was superior to my own&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">George III</span>, 2.152). Publicly he announced his intention to recoup his health by spending a winter in Paris. Unfortunately Conway made matters worse by treating his withdrawal as desertion. Walpole fled.<h2>
<a name="DeffandandChatterton17651777"></a>Deffand and Chatterton, 1765&#150;1777</h2>In Paris, Walpole needed no tutoring to play the role of eccentric islander in a Francophile mode that would to his own countrymen have not seemed very English at all. He relished a reception that made him something of a celebrity, though there were features of life in Paris that disturbed him. A sceptic himself, he was none the less a little shocked by the irreligion that he found, and more irritated by the tedium of fashionable philosophical discourse. A city that welcomed not only Walpole but also David Hume, who was secretary to the embassy there, could not be considered an unalloyed blessing. He detested Hume's <span class="italic">History</span>, &#145;so falsified in many points, so partial in as many, so very unequal in its parts&#146;. Of his conversation he was dismissive: &#145;he understood nothing till he had written upon it.&#146; And as philosopher Hume was a &#145;superficial mountebank&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 10.176; 16.266; 42.78).<br>
<br>Hume's employer as British ambassador was Walpole's own cousin and Conway's brother Lord Hertford. If Walpole's relations with Hume were at best polite, it is unlikely that he intended actively to humiliate him. That, however, was what he proceeded to do. In the winter of 1765&#150;6 a principal topic of conversation in Paris was the behaviour of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had left Switzerland after acrimonious public disputes, believed himself to be the victim of an elaborate conspiracy, and sought congenial refuge, which Hume intended to provide by taking him to Britain. In the midst of these transactions Walpole penned a letter from Frederick II to Rousseau inviting him to take shelter in Prussia. The letter satirized Rousseau's paranoia (not the most difficult of targets), made a considerable stir in Paris, and provoked a furious reaction from the latter, who came to suspect that Hume himself had been party to it. It was an extreme example of the unintended havoc that Walpole's mischief-making could cause, and one which Hume showed magnanimity in dismissing as &#145;a piece of levity&#146;. His remark about its author&#151;&#145;it is a strange inclination we have to be wits, preferably to every thing else&#146;&#151;might provide a devastating commentary on much else in Walpole's life and character  (E. C. Mossner, <span class="italic">The Life of David Hume</span>, 1954, 514).<br>
<br>Life in Paris absorbed Walpole to the full, but increasingly his interest came to focus on the outmoded but once powerful salon of Madame du Deffand, &#145;a blind old lady of wit&#146;, as he described her in his journal  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 7.261). She initially acted as a kind of French Lady Suffolk, a repository of knowledge about a period fast disappearing from living memory. From her standpoint Walpole was a charming newcomer who took as much trouble to fascinate her as if she had been forty years younger. Thus began a relationship increasingly charged with emotion and, not for the first or last time, on his side highly ambiguous in its commitment.<br>
<br>All the evidence is that during these months Walpole confided in Madame du Deffand as much as she confided in him. When he left he can have been in no doubt of the extent to which she had become dependent on him, uncomfortable though it increasingly made him feel. One night out of Paris, on the road to Calais, he wrote in terms which can only be recovered from her reply. In it she reassured him that their correspondence would be kept secret, expressed her joy at what he had said of his feelings for her, declared &#145;I want to be at my ease and to say that it is impossible to love more tenderly than I love you&#146;, and urged him not to alter his relationship with her. &#145;Remember that you are my tutor, my director; do not abandon my education&#146;  (Craveri, 273&#150;4). Once out of her presence, the intensity of this attachment caused him as much embarrassment as pleasure, though he never severed it.<br>
<br>The correspondence that began at this time eventually involved more than 800 exchanges over fourteen years. It is one of the most famous in the history of letter-writing and has provided much evidence for the prosecution when Walpole is charged with cynicism and duplicity. &#145;She loves me better than all France&#146;, he told Conway in 1774  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 39.189), but his apparently frequent pleas for her not to speak of love, his horror of ridicule concerning their relationship, and his promises to return to France repeatedly broken, all appear to condemn him with his own words. Remarkably, she bore this bizarre form of devotion, agreeing to be &#145;amis sans amiti&eacute;&#146;. She was a woman of the world, had been once the mistress of the regent of France, and enjoyed the regard of countless men of rank or wit or both. But twenty years older than Walpole and bereft of her sight, with time heavy on her hand, she considered him the lodestar of her existence.<br>
<br>Walpole journeyed again to see her in 1767, 1769, 1771, and 1775, on each occasion apparently restoring the relationship to something of the intensity that it had originally generated. He wrote to Lady Ailesbury in 1775, &#145;I have found my dear old woman so well, and looking so much better than she did four years ago, that I am transported with pleasure&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 39.255). Yet each time he left, the old reserve reasserted itself. These years coincided with worsening health for him, which genuinely rendered travel more uncomfortable and even threatened his life; at least, so Madame du Deffand feared. It was she who died first, none the less, in August 1780. She left him her papers, a gold box bearing a portrait in wax of her last little dog, Tonton, together with Tonton himself, whom he cherished for many years and even permitted &#145;to lie on every couch and chair&#146;  (ibid., 11.51).<br>
<br>Walpole's apparent heartlessness toward Madame du Deffand was a hostage to fortune that he entrusted to posterity by preserving her letters to him while destroying his own to her. But another supposed instance of it was brought to a contemporary public. In March 1769 he received from the young, and at that time unknown, Thomas Chatterton a copy of selections from the manuscript remains of one Thomas Rowley, who had supposedly in 1469 described the rise of painting in England and composed poems of which Chatterton provided examples. Walpole unwarily responded by asking for further examples and offering to publish specimens. Chatterton duly obliged and requested his new patron's support in obtaining employment. By this time Walpole had grown suspicious and sought independent information about his correspondent and advice from Mason and Gray about the manuscripts, with the predictable result. There followed an exchange in which he disengaged himself &#145;with as much kindness and tenderness as if I had been his guardian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.223). In April 1770 Chatterton made his way to London and engaged in various satirical activities that included attacks on Walpole's antiquarian researches under the pen of Baron Otranto. Walpole was probably unaware at this time that their author was Chatterton. Nor, when Chatterton committed suicide in August 1770, did he hear of it until the following April.<br>
<br>In subsequent years interest in Chatterton grew. In 1777, after the publication of the Rowley poems, the allegation that Walpole had driven their author to self-murder gained currency. Restless though he was under mounting attacks, Walpole did not issue a fully public rebuttal until 1782. It made little difference. The Chatterton smear, which had no origin in truth other than his initial gullibility, was to do his reputation enduring harm.<h2>
<a name="Politics17661790"></a>Politics, 1766&#150;1790</h2>One of the mainsprings of Walpole's existence had long been politics, even if his pleasure in it must have been largely vicarious, since he never showed a serious interest in obtaining public office himself. In his own words he lacked &#145;the least tincture of ambition&#146; but possessed &#145;a propensity to faction&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">George II</span>, xxix). His disillusionment with Henry Seymour Conway and his decision to retire from parliament in 1768 effectively shut down this aspect of his self-constructed identity, more conclusively perhaps than he himself anticipated. He did not discontinue his memoirs of the reign of George III, which he had commenced in 1766, and what were later to be known as his &#145;last journals&#146; took the story on eventually to 1783. But it was the story increasingly of an outsider.<br>
<br>Walpole attended only occasionally to hear the debates of either house, recognized that the newspapers were beginning to provide accounts as accurate as anything he could offer, and in time came to feel remote from the politicians of the day. By 1785 he could confess to Mann, apropos of the leading satires of the day, &#145;as there are continually allusions to parliamentary speeches and events, they are often obscure to me till I get them explained; and besides, I do not know several of the satirized heroes even by sight&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 25.612).<br>
<br>Walpole's own last political tract was published after the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> crisis in 1766, two years before he resigned his seat. The <span class="italic">Account of the Giants Lately Discovered</span> ironically suggested that reports of a newly found race of giants in South America would soon be followed by a parliamentary attempt to tax them. He consistently opposed the measures that led to war with America as well as the war itself, and derived no consolation from the accuracy of his prophecies on the subject. &#145;My English or selfish pride is mortified at seeing the decadence of our empire&#146; he wrote when American independence was conceded by treaty in 1783  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.420).<br>
<br>Despite his irritation with Conway, relations were repaired, though not restored to their earlier warmth, and Walpole's political sentiments remained those of whigs like him. Accordingly he was a moderate reformer at best. When economical reform threatened his sinecures in 1783, he gracefully promised the prime minister, Lord Shelburne, his co-operation, an undertaking carrying little risk since abolition without compensation was not proposed and Shelburne had political troubles that soon overwhelmed his reforming ambitions. Of parliamentary reform Walpole disapproved, characteristically offering a disarmingly casual argument. Fashion ruled all, he remarked:<blockquote>I carry this way of thinking still farther, and extend it to almost all reformations. Could one cure the world of being foolish, it were something&#151;but to cure it of any one folly, is only making room for some other, which one is sure will succeed to the vacant place. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 25.642)</blockquote>Walpole's sympathies in the 1780s remained with the Foxite whigs who inherited the Rockingham mantle and continued to command the allegiance of Conway. Of Pitt and his supporters, especially those whigs who threw in their lot with him in 1784, he was contemptuous. He quarrelled with a friend and correspondent of some years' standing, William Mason, in the process drawing up a concise statement of his political credo at this time:<blockquote>I have for five and forty years acted upon the principles of the constitution as it was settled at the Revolution, the best form of government that I know of in the world, and which made us a free people, a rich people, and a victorious people, by diffusing liberty, protecting property and encouraging commerce; and by the combination of all, empowering us to resist the ambition of the House of Bourbon, and to place ourselves on a level with that formidable neighbour. The narrow plan of royalty, which had so often preferred the aggrandizement of the Crown to the dignity of presiding over a great and puissant free kingdom, threw away one predominant source of our potency by aspiring to enslave America&#151;and would now compensate for that blunder and its consequence by assuming a despotic tone at home. It has found a tool in the light and juvenile son of the great minister who carried our glory to its highest pitch&#151;but it shall never have the insignificant approbation of an old and worn out son of another minister, who though less brilliant, maintained this country in the enjoyment of the twenty happiest years that England ever enjoyed. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 25.351)</blockquote>Many new developments of the period found Walpole equally unsympathetic. The fashionable tolerance that was improving the lot of Catholics awoke misgivings, and not only because of the plebeian outrage and violence that it unleashed in the Gordon riots of 1780s. The horror of &#145;popery&#146; as a political force never forsook him: &#145;You know I have ever been averse to toleration of an intolerant religion&#146;, he told Mann in 1784. The Irish reforming movement that inspired many liberal whiggish sympathizers left him cold, principally on this account. He warned of the &#145;impossibility of satisfying <i>Irish</i> Catholics, without restoring their estates. It was particularly silly to revive the subject in this age, when Popery was so rapidly declining&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 25.541). The rise of a new empire in the East did not comfort him. During the proceedings to impeach Warren Hastings he quipped about either &#145;black-washing&#146; or &#145;white-washing&#146; Hastings but entertained no doubt that India had been &#145;blood-washed by our countrymen!&#146;  (ibid., 25.630). When Cornwallis crushed the principal obstacle to British supremacy in India, Tippoo Sahib, in 1792, he rejoiced without rapture &#145;for we have usurped India till it is become part of our vitals&#146;  (ibid., 34.146).<br>
<br>No very great analysis or thought went into these judgements. They were the instinctive reactions of one taught to fear those who had corrupted other societies and sought thereby to corrupt their own. Walpole approved Edward Gibbon's analysis of the decline of Rome. Even the explorations of the wider world that excited much contemporary opinion merely evoked his distaste for barbaric cultures. The famous prints of South Sea faces in James Cook's <span class="italic">Voyage</span> he dismissed as:<blockquote>a parcel of ugly faces with blubber lips and flat noses, dressed as unbecomingly as if both sexes were ladies of the first fashion; and rows of savages with backgrounds of palm-trees. Indeed, I shall not give five guineas and half&#151;nay, they sell already for nine, for such uncouth lubbers: nor do I desire to know how unpolished the north or south poles have remained ever since Adam and Eve were just such mortals. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.436)</blockquote>Such insensitivity did not imply an absence of concern for the undertrodden. Walpole opposed slavery and the slave trade long before that became a fashionable humanitarian cause of the 1770s. He did so on robustly whiggish grounds. It is doubtful whether he ever thought in terms of what were coming to be called &#145;natural rights&#146;. The cult of nature of the 1760s had never impressed him, though as in other matters the contradictions in his thinking would require more pains to reconcile than he ever showed signs of taking. When, in 1780, he added a fourth volume to his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, covering the reigns of the first two Hanoverian kings, he also included a neat little <span class="italic">Essay on Modern Gardening</span>, trumpeting the triumphs of English landscape gardening as pioneered by Kent and developed by Brown. His friend the former French ambassador the duc de Nivernais provided an elegant translation of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, which was printed at the Strawberry Hill press. Walpole's extravagant dismissal of the &#145;unnatural&#146; French taste in gardening does not seem to have inhibited its success across the channel.<br>
<br>On the other hand, Walpole struck a modest literary blow at naturalism when he briefly figured as a dramatist on the London stage. In 1772 he had written his <span class="italic">Hieroglyphic Tales</span>, written with a child as reader in mind and later published in 1785. The fantastic incongruity of these little fairy stories was followed up with a &#145;moral entertainment&#146; that he wrote in 1773, entitled <span class="italic">Nature will Prevail</span>. It was staged by George Colman in 1778 with some success. Its moral was that in a state of nature on a desert island human nature does indeed revert to ill will and unkindness.<br>
<br>If the French Revolution had a simple creed, it was that of natural rights. But the revolution appalled Walpole. He was never a Francophobe but he had always disliked the doctrinaire atheism of the professedly enlightened. His own scepticism perfectly reflected the modish theology that prevailed at court during his father's day. &#145;I have a real affection for Bishop Hoadley: he stands with me in lieu of what are called <i>the Fathers</i>&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 16.282&#150;3). By the time he wrote this, in 1785, there were other forms of fashionable latitudinarianism that he might have cited, but he took care not to read anything that might have served such a purpose. Whatever he learned from his interest in the middle ages, it had nothing to do with the spiritual belief that had underpinned so much of the Gothic legacy. He relished the story of Henry V's diversion of funds from a hospital for war victims to Archbishop Chichele's foundation of All Souls College, Oxford. &#145;How history makes one shudder and laugh by turns!&#146;  (ibid., 35.387). The evangelical revival passed him by, except as matter for mockery. Among his more spectacularly faulty prophecies was that of the decline of Methodism after the deaths of John Wesley and Lady Huntingdon in 1791  (ibid., 11.297).<br>
<br>In all this it was taste rather than very deep thought that guided Walpole. The manner of the French <i>philosophes</i> and indeed many others seems to have offended him more than what they said. To Lady Upper Ossory, who had ventured to praise Beaumarchais, he denounced &#145;the dictatorial pertness of the modern French authors&#146; with a passion which must have disconcerted her by its brutality  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.543). For one of Walpole's temperament and prejudices the revolution was the supreme example of the French capacity to apply a frivolous mind to serious matters. He would not have denied his own supposedly English readiness to apply serious thought to frivolous matters. That is not to say that he did not take seriously the war of ideas that the revolution unleashed. He admired Edmund Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections on the Revolution</span>, and in terms that might have surprised some. &#145;Every page shows how sincerely he is in earnest&#151;a wondrous merit in a political pamphlet&#151;All other party writers <i>act</i> zeal for the public, but it never seems to flow from the heart&#146;  (ibid., 34.98). He even endorsed Burke's controversial purple passage in praise of Marie Antoinette, recalling the occasion when he himself had first set eyes on her and instantly worshipped at the same shrine.<h2>
<a name="Familyandfriends17681790"></a>Family and friends, 1768&#150;1790</h2>A younger son not expected to sustain the fortunes of his house by marriage or an active career, Walpole never lost his attachment to his family and viewed with mounting if somewhat fatalistic dismay its descent into ruin. For his beloved Houghton and its contents the prospects were bleak indeed. His father had died in debt. The second earl's fortunes were sustained by state sinecures which lapsed on his death. The third earl brought nothing but gross mismanagement and extravagance to the task of preserving his patrimony. By 1773 both the estate and his senses were in such disorder that his uncle intervened to set about restoring the former. It proved a short respite. Despite promises to reform, the third earl's folly continued. In 1779 he took the catastrophic step that his nephew had dreaded most, selling the Houghton picture collection to Catherine II of Russia. &#145;It is the most signal mortification to my idolatry for my father's memory, that it could receive&#146;, he wrote to Lady Upper Ossory. &#145;It is stripping the temple of his glory and of his affection. A madman excited by rascals has burnt his Ephesus. I must never cast a thought toward Norfolk more&#151;nor will hear my nephew's name if I can avoid it&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 32.86).<br>
<br>Walpole's brother Sir Edward died in 1784, taking with him their mutually beneficial share of the collectorship of the customs. One of his natural daughters, Maria, to whom her uncle was particularly attached, married the much older Lord Waldegrave, whose politics were congenial. Waldegrave died only four years after the marriage, in 1763. To Walpole's embarrassment Maria became involved with one of the king's brothers, the duke of Gloucester, and contracted a secret marriage with him in 1766. When the marriage was revealed to the king in 1771, the couple and all who attended them were excluded from court, a challenge which Walpole eagerly confronted by publicly visiting the duke and duchess at the first available opportunity. Though the relationship had been cemented against his wishes, henceforward the Waldegrave family became in effect his own adopted family.<br>
<br>Walpole's own legacy, at Strawberry Hill, continued to be his main preoccupation. Work on it had not ceased when the major extensions of the 1760s were complete. There followed two large bedchambers, the &#145;Great North&#146; and the &#145;State&#146;, a new tower designed by the architect James Essex, and the Beauclerk Tower, named after illustrations of <span class="italic">The Mysterious Mother</span> drawn by Lady Diana Beauclerk. A chapel was added in the garden mainly to house some of his ever expanding collection of painting, monuments, relics, and curios. His own catalogue of the collection was printed in 1774 as <span class="italic">Description of Strawberry Hill</span>; a revised edition appeared ten years later. By this time the house, close to London and in a charming locality, was well placed to attract the tourist as well as its owner's personal friends. The bizarre diversity of the contents added to the impact. Walpole never pretended that his was other than a highly idiosyncratic collection, and items such as Wolsey's red hat and Henry VIII's clock with obscene pendulum certainly provided confirmation. The first royal visit had been that of the duke of Cumberland in 1754; the last was that of Queen Charlotte with eight princesses in 1795. For less privileged visitors there was a carefully arranged set of rules governing the issue of tickets and orderly behaviour.<br>
<br>Walpole's circle of friends contracted during the decade following his disillusionment with Conway. Lady Suffolk died in 1767, Lady Hervey in 1768. A little later, in 1771, he lost Gray. More mysteriously, one of his earliest friends and correspondents, the country squire George Montagu, broke with him in 1770, but the most grievous deprivation was that of Chute, in 1776. &#145;My loss is most irreparable. To me he was the most faithful and secure of friends, and a delightful companion.&#146; He added, most revealingly, &#145;I shall not seek to replace him&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 24.212).<br>
<br>All through his life, on the stage that he created for himself, Walpole had manipulated the other players, not always with complete success. But as the casualties mounted replacement became increasingly difficult. Cole, with whom his relations had remained so consistent and warm, despite their divergent politics, died in 1782. In 1785 he lost his nearest neighbour, Kitty Clive, and in 1786 his most distant, Horace Mann, on whom he had not set eyes since 1741 but with whom he had corresponded regularly and fully during the intervening forty-five years. There were new contacts and correspondents indeed, but not all of a calibre to match those they might be thought to replace. A partial exception was the antiquary John Pinkerton, though Walpole cannot have been unaware of his self-serving nature. Pinkerton was later to publish his recollections of the master in <span class="italic">Walpoliana</span>.<br>
<br>Increasingly Walpole recognized his own isolation. To Conway he wrote in June 1784: &#145;I am very well content to be a Strulbrug, and to <i>exist</i> after I have done <i>being</i>&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 39.415). To Mann, soon after, he added, &#145;I do worse than live out of the world, for I live with the old women of my neighbourbood&#146;  (ibid., 25.542). Women certainly predominated. Lady Diana Beauclerk, like Lady Upper Ossory, a divorcee whom Walpole cultivated both before and after her fall from social grace, became a frequent companion when she moved to Twickenham following her second husband's death in 1780. For Conway's daughter, married briefly and unhappily to John Damer, who took his own life to release himself from debt, Walpole had an enduring affection. Lady Diana was a draughtswoman, Anne Damer a sculptress. Of the talents of each Walpole was an unreserved admirer. Other women who figured among his acquaintance had to work harder to earn his approval. Hannah More took his teasing about her religious views (&#145;My dear Saint Hannah&#146;) in good part and displayed her poetic more than her puritanical side, thereby permitting to flourish what might have been a somewhat fraught relationship.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears17901797"></a>Last years, 1790&#150;1797</h2>Among the women in Walpole's life, two sisters, &#145;two pearls that I found in my path&#146; came to be his close friends  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 34.26). The Misses Berry, Mary and Agnes, became neighbours of Walpole's in Twickenham when their impecunious father rented a house there in 1788. &#145;My two StrawBerries&#146;  (ibid.) were in their mid-twenties, had polite manners without the affectation of fashionable society, and were delighted, not merely dutiful, listeners. Some of the anecdotes that he deployed they published in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences, Written in 1788, for the Amusement of Miss Mary and Miss Agnes Berry</span>. Many of these he had originally received from that earlier neighbour in Twickenham, Lady Suffolk.<br>
<br>Now in his seventies, Walpole at last needed company more than it needed him. He also found himself dropping the emotional guard which had so long kept him free of attachments that he could not control for his own purposes. For Mary especially he acquired a particular affection. His letters pursued the sisters when they toured England with their father in 1789 and again when they resorted to the continent in 1790. The dangers they were courting in France increased his fury with the revolution. &#145;It remained for the enlightened eighteenth century to baffle language and invent horrors that can be found in no vocabulary&#146;, he wrote to Lady Upper Ossory after the execution of Louis XVI  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 34.177). The resulting anxiety and agitation made his letters to his &#145;dear, dear wives&#146; unlike any others, perhaps, that he ever composed  (ibid., 11.326). Their return in November 1791 was a huge relief, not least because he settled them in Little Strawberry Hill, or Cliveden, the house formerly occupied by Kitty Clive.<br>
<br>For the remaining years of his life the Berrys and Mrs Damer were Walpole's principal props, though they cannot be said to have led a serene existence. Mary Berry was in love with a military friend of Conway, General Charles O'Hara, a passion interrupted by his spells abroad and terminated when she plucked up courage to leave her father and Walpole in order to marry him, only to quarrel with her fianc&eacute; before they married. Mrs Damer also took an interest in Mary Berry that was not without a sexual tinge. Walpole seems to have succeeded in ignoring this emotional turbulence. From his own hand, at least, there is no suggestion that he entertained the notion of marrying Mary himself, though his evident affection for her certainly led others to speculate, if only concerning any designs she might have on his fortune.<br>
<br>By this time Walpole was fourth earl of Orford, following the death of his nephew in December 1791. His inheritance was bleak indeed. The estate was heavily encumbered with debt. Houghton had been despoiled not only of its pictures but also of much else that the third earl had alienated. The new peer never appeared in the House of Lords. With the keenest sense of Sir Robert Walpole's grandeur and glory he had inherited only the ruins of the former and had no prospect of passing on the latter.<br>
<br>The deaths of the 1790s removed Walpole's oldest and closest connections: Selwyn in 1791, Lincoln in 1794, Conway in 1795. Berkeley Square (which had replaced Arlington Street in 1778, when its lease was about to fall in) in winter, Strawberry Hill in summer, and a contracting circle in each provided his final scenes. His health was not good. To his gout was added recurrent rheumatism. The end came after an illness first brought on by a cold spell at Strawberry Hill in November 1796. Removal to Berkeley Square did not mend matters and he died there on 2 March 1797. He was buried in Houghton church in the family tomb on 13 March.<h2>
<a name="Thelegacy"></a>The legacy</h2>In default of male heirs Houghton went to the Cholmondeley family through Sir Robert's daughter Mary. It has remained there ever since. Strawberry Hill was destined for the Waldegraves, though Anne Damer was granted possession for life, a right which she ceded in 1811. The seventh earl, who succeeded to the title in 1835, demolished portions of the house and auctioned off its treasures in 1842: the sale lasted thirty-two days and realized over &pound;33,000. But his widow, Frances, gave it a new lease of life during her two subsequent marriages, to George Harcourt MP and Lord Carlingford. Some of the dispersed collections were restored and the house partly rebuilt. As a leading hostess she again made Strawberry Hill a place of social and political resort. After her death the house passed to Baron Stern and later into institutional hands. Having survived a German bomb in 1941, it remains remarkably well preserved to this day.<br>
<br>In 1784 Walpole had explicitly condemned &#145;all publication of private letters in which living persons are named&#146;, claiming to have postponed publication of the fourth volume of his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painters</span> on this account  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 42.121). During his last years he was engaged on editing his correspondence with Mann, and the first letters from his own collection appeared soon after his death in 1798, as part of the five-volume edition of his <span class="italic">Works</span>, superintended by Mary Berry. During the following decades further instalments were issued, beginning with that of Madame du Deffand, in 1810. Few private correspondences would have withstood the resulting glare, but Walpole's moral ambiguity and malicious irony were particularly ill-calculated to appeal to a public audience. The attack from which his reputation was not to recover for almost a century was made by Macaulay when he reviewed the early letters to Mann, published with Waldegrave's support by the Conservative politician Lord Dover in 1833. Macaulay boasted that finishing his article on Walpole was &#145;one of the happy moments of my life: &hellip; I think that this article will be a hit. &hellip; I have laid it on Walpole so unsparingly that I shall not be surprised if Miss Berry should cut me&#146;  (Dover to Hannah Macaulay, G. O. Macaulay, ed., <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay</span>, 1886, 239). The most damaging charge was Walpole's supposedly phenomenal duplicity and hypocrisy: &#145;mask upon mask&#146;.<br>
<br>It would be wrong, however, wholly to blame either Macaulay or the letters for the rapid decline of Walpole's reputation. The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, which are very different in tone and temper as well as literary structure and style, were not much better received. Although unquestionably written with posterity in mind, their publication had been delayed by Walpole himself. He left instructions drawing attention to &#145;a large wainscot chest marked on the outside with a great A&#146; which was to remain securely locked until an Earl Waldegrave attained the age of thirty-five. In due course in 1810 the sixth earl, expecting &#145;silver, gold or precious jewels&#146;, opened the chest to find the manuscripts of Walpole's memoirs. On Lord Holland's advice the volumes covering the reign of George II were published in 1822, almost unexpurgated. Holland made no progress with the later memoirs of the reign of George III, which were entrusted to Sir Denis Le Marchant and published in 1845. The <span class="italic">Last Journals</span> appeared later, in 1859, edited by Alban Doran.<br>
<br>To many the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> confirmed the impression left by the <span class="italic">Letters</span>. The belletrist Anne Grant of Laggan was shocked by a &#145;Pandora's box&#146; that poured<blockquote>forth its pernicious and very malicious contents upon the devoted heads of the sons and successors of all the great characters, whose talents and whose virtues shed lustre over names that will be honoured and revered, while that of Horace lives with the French wits and philosophers of the last century, to show, like them, how worthless are wit and talents, when perverted to be the implements of mischief to mankind. (J. P. Grant, ed., <span class="italic">Memoir and Correspondence of Mrs. Grant of Laggan</span>, 3 vols., 1844, 2.325)</blockquote>The politician and reviewer John Croker, who believed Walpole &#145;to have been as bad a man as ever lived&#146;, devoted his critical talents to &#145;exposing his errors and defeating his personal malevolence&#146;  (L. J. Jennings, ed., <span class="italic">The Croker Papers: the Correspondence and Diaries of the Late Right Honourable John Wilson Croker</span>, 2nd edn, 3 vols., 1885, 1.270&#150;71). Even approving readers tended to be less than enthusiastic. The whig wit Joseph Jekyll compared the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> to &#145;cold meat on the side table&#146;  (A. Bourke, ed., <span class="italic">Correspondence of Mr. Joseph Jekyll with his Sister-in-Law, Lady Gertrude Sloane Stanley, 1818&#150;1838</span>, 1894, 134). The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> were widely read and plundered, providing a crucial source for the history of the eighteenth century, yet the author's reputation benefited little.<br>
<br>It did not help Walpole's posthumous standing that he had carried to the grave personal manners that seemed to embody the least appealing features of eighteenth-century social life. The waspish wit and man about town of the 1740s was portrayed in the 1780s and 1790s by men and women whose verdict, even when well meant, damned him with subsequent audiences. James Boswell (no impartial judge considering Walpole's dislike of Samuel Johnson) called him &#145;genteel, fastidious, priggish&#146;  (I. S. Lustig and F. A. Pottle, eds., <span class="italic">Boswell: the English Experiment, 1785&#150;1789</span>, 1986, 217). His physical appearance and demeanour tended to confirm the impression. He was slight and slender, reinforcing the effeminate manner that a less than strong voice, a somewhat mincing gait, and an affected mode of address conveyed. In later life the animation that all associated with him was lessened by his bowed frame and constricted movement, though to the end observers found his eyes strikingly bright. In his own generation there was nothing about his personal appearance that was not acceptable and agreeable, but changing models of masculinity tended to emphasize a more muscular, more robust, more reserved and less precious pattern of manly conduct, making him seem anachronistic and eccentric.<br>
<br>Walpole was never completely swamped by Victorian disapproval, and the revival of interest in the literary legacy of the eighteenth century at the end of the nineteenth promised something of a reassessment. Austin Dobson's contribution to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> reflected this less grudging recognition of Walpole's talents. At the same time his manners and morals were coming to seem less problematic especially to a generation in the early twentieth century that found Victorian high-mindedness and solemnity increasingly oppressive or even ridiculous. On the other hand, one of his securer achievements, the generally accurate information and clear, if often biased, interpretations of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, came under some severe criticism from a new school of historians. The Namier assault on whig interpretations of eighteenth-century politics fastened on sources that supported the depiction of George III as a tyrannical opponent of the constitutional balance achieved in 1688. After Edmund Burke, Walpole offered the most telling testimony and suffered accordingly.<br>
<br>Even so, Walpole fared better with the twentieth century than the nineteenth. Partly this was a matter of changing intellectual fashions. Modern art history is less judgemental than it once was and his role in the Gothic revival attracts more tolerant scholarship than it formerly did. Similarly his literary and antiquarian works have gained from locating them in their cultural context rather than rating them for their canonical status. His political views are no longer central to historiographical warfare; his adherence to a mild version of whig republicanism looks less like gross hypocrisy than sentimental, if self-indulgent, antiquarianism and a logical part of the past that he constructed around himself. But above all the wealth of material that has now been published about him permits a more rounded and wholly humane picture than any selection could.<br>
<br>That this is so is largely due to one man, Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis (1897&#150;1979). Lewis was a Yale scholar who in his early twenties developed an entirely amiable obsession with Walpole and his work. With the keen support of his wife he set about collecting whatever was purchasable that had to do with Walpole, his works, or his possessions. He also engaged on a massive edition of Walpole's correspondence, which ran to forty-eight volumes, published between 1937 and 1983. At Farmington, Connecticut, a large proportion of Walpole's library has been reassembled to sit alongside a considerable number of the furnishings, portraits, and curiosities once at Strawberry Hill. Evidence of Lewis's own fixation abounds, not without self-parody worthy of his subject. A commemoration in oils to mark the scholar's seventy-third birthday depicts birthday cake, champagne, and a volume entitled <span class="italic">Fifty Years of Lewis</span>, &#145;by Walpole&#146;. The history of this remarkable act of reconstruction will itself provide a fertile field of inquiry.<br>
<br>Though his scholarship was immaculate, Lewis's own writings are not voluminous. He left no canonical biography nor any extended body of critical work on the subject, unless it be his charming collection of essays, <span class="italic">Rescuing Horace Walpole</span>, which provides the historical context for certain items at Farmington based on his fantasy of a divine injunction to select twenty-six objects of the many thousands that he had amassed, and an elegant collection of Mellon lectures delivered in 1960.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Lewis was evidently well aware that his lifelong mission would provoke debate. For himself he remarked that he had grown to like Walpole &#145;more and more as a person&#146;. He also recorded his judgement that Walpole was to be placed third after Franklin and Jefferson among those English-speaking men who were &#145;most like the versatile men of the Renaissance&#146;  (Lewis, <span class="italic">Selected Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 1973, xix). However others judge these matters, the legacy of Horace Walpole is now the legacy of Walpole and Lewis.<br>
