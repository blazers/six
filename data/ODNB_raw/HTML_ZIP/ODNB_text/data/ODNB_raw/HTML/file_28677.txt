<span class="headword">Warburton, Sir  Robert</span>  (1842&#150;1899), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in a Ghilzai fort between Jagdalak and Gandamak on 11 July 1842, was the only son of Robert Warburton (<i>d</i>. 10 Nov 1864), lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, Shah Jahan Begum (<i>d</i>. in or after 1866), a noble Afghan lady, niece of the Amir Dost Muhammad. His half-brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64159/', "John Paul Warburton (1840&#150;1919)")</script>. At the time of his birth his mother was fleeing from the troops of Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan, who pursued her for months after the massacre of the British at Kabul on 1 November 1841. She was sheltered by her relatives, and rejoined her husband on 20 September 1842. At the close of the First Anglo-Afghan War Robert and his mother accompanied his father's battery to Sipri, and then to Morar in Gwalior. In 1850 he was placed at school at Mussooree under Robert North Maddock, where he remained until 1 December 1856. He was then sent to England, and was placed at Kensington grammar school under the Revd George Frost. Thence he obtained a military cadetship, and after one term at Addiscombe College and two at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery on 18 December 1861.<br>
<br>In 1862 Warburton was sent to India and stationed with the 1st battery of the 24th brigade at Fort Govindghar, the fortress of Amritsar. In August 1864 he exchanged into F battery of the 18th brigade and was stationed at Mian Mir. In 1866 the failure of the Agra and Masterman's Bank left him with only his pay to support himself and his mother. To increase his resources he exchanged into the 21st Punjab infantry. They were under orders for Abyssinia, and disembarked at Zoula on 1 February 1868. While serving with the transport train he showed great tact in conciliating local feeling, and he received the thanks of Sir Robert Napier. When he was invalided to England Napier wrote to the lieutenant-governor of the Punjab recommending Warburton for employment on the frontier. In 1868 Warburton married Mary, eldest daughter of William Cecil of Dyffryn, Monmouthshire. On his return to India in April 1869 he was attached to the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs, and in July 1870 he was appointed to the Punjab commission as an assistant commissioner to the Peshawar division. At the end of September 1872 he was removed temporarily to the sub-district of Yusufzai and stationed at Hoti-mardan, and in February 1876 he was permanently appointed to the post. Under Sir Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari he took part in several campaigns against the hill peoples who raided British territory, particularly against the Utman Khel in 1878, and was repeatedly complimented by the government of the Punjab and by the secretary of state for India. In 1879, during the Afghan campaign, Cavagnari made repeated applications for Warburton's services, but the Punjab government refused to spare him. In July, however, he was appointed political officer of the Khyber, a post he held for eighteen years.<br>
<br>On the news of the murder of Cavagnari at Kabul, Warburton was nominated chief political officer with General Sir R. O. Bright, commanding the Jalalabad field force. He joined the force on 10 October 1879 and proceeded to Jalalabad to ascertain the revenues of the district. In April 1880 he was invalided to England, and he did not return to the Khyber until 16 February 1882. From that time he remained on the frontier almost continuously until his retirement. Stern and implacable when necessary, he acquired a remarkable influence over the hill peoples, due in part to his Afghan ancestry. He raised the Khyber Rifles from among these peoples, and for many years kept the pass tranquil. His camp became the rendezvous of mutually hostile tribesmen. He was accustomed to travel with no weapon but a walking-stick, and everywhere met with demonstrations of affection. Able to converse fluently with the learned in Persian and with the common folk in the vernacular Pashto, he succeeded, by his acquaintance with tribal life and character, in gaining an unequalled influence over the border Afghans.<br>
<br>In 1881 Warburton was promoted major, and in 1887 lieutenant-colonel. On 1 January 1890 he was created CSI. In 1893 he was promoted brevet colonel. He resigned his post on 11 July 1897 and received the thanks of the Punjab government. He had frequently requested the government to appoint an assistant who might continue his policy and succeed to his post after his retirement. This request was never granted, and the appointment of a successor without local experience was immediately followed by unrest. On the outbreak of unrest among the Afridis in August 1897 Warburton was asked by the Indian government on 13 August whether he would resume his service in connection with the Khyber Pass and the Afridis. He declared himself willing, but on 23 August, before definite orders had been given, open hostilities broke out. He served with the Tirah expedition of 1897&#150;8, and in May 1898 he was created KCIE. The hardships of the rapid campaign wore out his constitution, and the loss of the Khyber posts caused him great heart-ache. He returned to England in poor health. He died at his home, 3 Russell Road, Kensington, on 22 April 1899, and was buried at Brompton cemetery on 27 April. Warburton's reminiscences were published posthumously as <span class="italic">Eighteen Years in the Khyber</span> (1900).<br>
