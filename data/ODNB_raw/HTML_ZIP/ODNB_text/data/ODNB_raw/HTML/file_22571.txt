</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Porter,  Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1776, <em>d.</em> 1850), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Durham and baptized there on 17 January 1776 at St Mary-le-Bow, North Bailey, the third child and elder daughter of the five children of William Porter (1735&#150;1779), army surgeon with the 6th Inniskilling dragoons, and Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blenkinsop (1745&#150;1831). Her ancestors included Sir William Porter, present at Agincourt, Endymion Porter, royalist patron of Jonson, and, on her mother's side, John Tweddell, traveller in Greece.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>In 1780, after Jane's father's death, her mother moved the three younger children to Edinburgh, where a good, cheap education could be obtained. Jane and her sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22559/', "Anna Maria Porter (1778&#150;1832)")</script>, attended George Fulton's school, where both shone and Anna Maria was apparently a prodigy. The children read widely&#151;ballads, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Sidney, as well as history and biography. They also had an important formative education in the romantic environment of Edinburgh. An old woman, Luckie Forbes, told them stories of ancient heroes, especially William Wallace. Their mother was acquainted with Walter Scott's mother, and he is said to have played with the girls when he was a boy (Scott, however, makes no reference to the family in his letters or journals).<br>
<br>The girls had an early literary bent, and their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22577/', "Robert Ker Porter (1777&#150;1842)")</script> showed promise as a painter. It was probably to assist his career that the family moved to London, having first spent some time in the north of England, in the area round Bamburgh and Lindisfarne; it may be this interlude that is commemorated in Northcote's sketch of the three young Porters reading and drawing in a Gothic chamber  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 102, 1832, 578). But the significant move was to the artistic and literary circles of the metropolis, where the family lived in various locations&#151;St Martin's Lane, Great Newport Street, and Gerrard Street, Soho. The Porters were usually short of money&#151;many family letters mention financial affairs&#151;but Mrs Porter contrived to be sociable for her children's sake. The girls became acquainted with Elizabeth Inchbald, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Hannah More, Elizabeth Hamilton, and Mrs De Crespigny; Robert, through the influence of Benjamin West, entered Somerset House as an academy student, joining a group of young men making their way in the art world.<br>
<br>Robert, Jane, and Anna Maria were involved in a periodical, <span class="italic">The Quiz</span>, founded by Thomas Dibdin, which ran for a short time. Dibdin's recollections evoke a group of lively young people, flexing their literary muscles; Jane, he remembers, as in her portrait by Kearsley, was &#145;pensive, meditative&#146;  (T. Dibdin, <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Literary Life</span>, 1836, 1.175). Jane's diary reveals that in these early years she wrote a eulogy on Mary Wollstonecraft.<br>
<br>Although Jane Porter claims in her foreword of 1831 that the &#145;historical&#146; romance <span class="italic">Thaddeus of Warsaw</span> (1803) was her first substantial publication, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> names her as author of <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Elbe</span> (1799), a romance in the German taste. An unpublished letter indicates that <span class="italic">The Two Princes of Persia: Addressed to Youth</span> (1801), a moralistic fable published under the name I. Porter, was also her work. Neither was kindly treated by contemporary reviewers, which may explain Porter's unwillingness to admit authorship.<h2>
<a name="Literarysuccess"></a>Literary success</h2>Although she is now remembered mainly for <span class="italic">The Scottish Chiefs</span> Jane Porter was more celebrated in her lifetime as the author of <span class="italic">Thaddeus</span>. Neither <span class="italic">Thaddeus</span> nor <span class="italic">The Scottish Chiefs</span> is a historical novel in the manner of Scott's later <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels: although she did some research for both, Jane Porter shows little interest in understanding either historical or contemporary events. Her more modest boast was that she was first in making fictional and real historical characters interact. Even this is probably not the case, but Porter believed it to be so, and certainly her method was popular with her readers. <span class="italic">Thaddeus</span> was inspired by Jane's hero-worship of the Polish patriot Kosciusko, whom Robert had met, and by the Polish refugees who wandered about the area of St James's Park. To the &#145;real&#146; exploits of these unfortunate men is added the fictional tale of Thaddeus Sobieski, supposed descendant of John Sobieski. After the unsuccessful nationalist struggle in Poland in 1794&#150;5, Thaddeus flees to London, where he plays a virtuous part in various adventures, and finds both love and his long-lost, and wrongly supposed traitorous, father.<br>
<br>The liveliest parts of the novel concern Thaddeus's attempts to make a living by his painting; his embarrassments with dealers are based on the early life of Robert's friend John Sell Cotman, and have a solidity about them not evident throughout the novel. Porter recounted that General Gardiner, the last British minister to the court of Stanislaus Augustus, was amazed that she had never been to Poland, but this was probably gallantry. Yet <span class="italic">Thaddeus</span> gained her extraordinary accolades: a relative of Kosciusko sent her a gold ring containing a portrait of the hero, and, when the novel was translated into German, she was made canoness of the Teutonic order of St Joachim. A drawing of her by Harlow in the appropriate garb was widely reproduced, and remains the most famous image of her.<br>
<br>In 1804, when Robert, who had achieved some fame as a painter of historical scenes, was appointed court painter to Tsar Alexander I of Russia, the Porter women moved to Long Ditton, Kingston. Here Jane wrote her second major novel, <span class="italic">The Scottish Chiefs</span>, based on William Wallace and Robert Bruce, which was taken even more seriously than <span class="italic">Thaddeus</span>. Napoleon amazingly proscribed a book that was accused even at the time of being unhistorical and wildly sentimental. Yet it was very widely read and translated, and reprinted nine times before the turn of the century.<br>
<br>Porter's belief that she influenced Scott is mostly wish-fulfilment: Scott himself is reported by Hogg as disappointed with her conception of Wallace  (J. Hogg, <span class="italic">Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 1834, 237). Nevertheless, the jealous passion of Lady Mar, who betrays Wallace when he spurns her advances, is nearly credible, and it may be that Jane Porter's Christian morality inhibited a talent for the treatment of the paradoxical attractiveness of wickedness. Certainly she was horrified by her own success with the profligate Wharton in her later work <span class="italic">The Pastor's Fire-Side</span> (1817). This novel shows a more than usually acute sense of local colour in its delineation of the area round Lindisfarne, of which Porter may have refreshed her early acquaintance when she went in 1804 to nurse her friend the man of letters Percival Stockdale. In 1824 she drew another exemplary hero, at the request of George IV, in <span class="italic">Duke Christian of L&uuml;neburg</span>. &#145;I could not but obey so distinguishing a command&#146;, said Porter  (Porter, &#145;Retrospective introduction&#146;, xxxv&#150;xxxvi), but even Porter's admirers found the duke an insipid creation.<h2>
<a name="Otherworksandlaterlife"></a>Other works and later life</h2>Porter's minor literary productions confirm her somewhat inflated sense of herself as a woman of letters. These include &#145;A defence of the profession of an actor&#146; (1800); a &#145;Sketch of the campaign of Count Suwarrow Ryminski&#146; (1804), probably a catalogue entry for one of Robert's paintings; <span class="italic">The Aphorisms of Sir Philip Sidney</span> (1807); some pieces for periodicals, including <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> and Samuel Hall's <span class="italic">Amulet</span>; and a preface to a sentimental novel, <span class="italic">Young Hearts</span> (1834).<br>
<br>Jane Porter also made some disastrous excursions into the theatre. As a young woman she had a sentimental attachment to Kemble and she tried in 1805 to persuade the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to produce an opera by her brother Robert, even making suggestions about casting. Nothing seems to have come of this, and it might have been better had the same remained true of her own dramas. <span class="italic">Switzerland</span>, presented at Drury Lane on 15 February 1819, was withdrawn on the night by the manager. Kean took the central part and seems to have deliberately sabotaged the performance. It was the belief of the actor W. C. Macready that Porter had tried again three years later with <span class="italic">Owen, Prince of Powys</span>. The play, which Macready pronounced &#145;a sad failure&#146;  (W. C. Macready, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1875, 1.233), was in fact the work of the actor Samson Penley  (McLean, 148).<br>
<br>Porter's stock did not stand high with those writers who have come to be most admired: some (Wordsworth and Coleridge) never mention her; others (Lamb and Keats) avoided meeting her. Saintsbury later dismisses her work as characterized by a &#145;general diffusion of silliness&#146;  (Saintsbury, 2.305&#150;6), but Porter's admirers were not uniformly silly or gullible, and notably included Joanna Baillie; others, Thomas Campbell and Tom Moore, seemed happy to know her. Her success is explicable by the increasing voracity of the public's appetite for narrative, by her promulgation of evangelical Christian ethics as the &#145;real&#146; basis of Western history, and by a contemporary fascination with the woman writer, a fascination which simultaneously allowed contempt and approval.<br>
<br>After Porter's early successes the popular taste for historical romance began to wane and by the thirties had given way to the craze for the fashionable novel. Anna Maria made forays into the contemporary but Jane was unsuited to the actual. A natural hero-worshipper, Jane Porter turned even daily life into a romance. Porter admired &#145;great men&#146;, particularly Sir Sidney Smith, the dedicatee of <span class="italic">Thaddeus</span>, and she was devoted to her brother Robert, who obliged with his exciting life in Russia, in the Peninsular War with Sir John Moore, as an Eastern traveller, and from 1826 as consul in Venezuela. Her other brothers were less heroic. John may have died a debtor in 1811 in Castle Rushen on the Isle of Man. William had a life of some vicissitude as a naval surgeon, was twice married, and finally settled in a practice in Bristol, where he remained in close correspondence with the Porter women, who moved about 1826 to Esher in Surrey.<br>
<br>The Porter sisters collaborated on two collections, <span class="italic">Tales Round a Winter's Hearth</span> (1826), for which Jane wrote &#145;Berenice's pilgrimage&#146;, drawing on Robert's Eastern travels, and <span class="italic">Coming Out, and, The Field of Forty Footsteps</span>&#151;Jane's &#145;The field of forty footsteps&#146; is set in Cromwell's time. After 1828 Porter wrote no further extended work. She has been credited with <span class="italic">Sir Edward Seaward's Narrative</span> (1831), the alleged eighteenth-century narrative of a shipwreck and subsequent colonizing of some Caribbean islands. Porter presents herself as editor of Sir Edward's papers but this is not, as was assumed, a way of concealing <i>her</i> authorship but rather that of her brother William. William drew on his shipboard experiences to produce a work that is a loss to the Jane Porter canon, since it could previously be adduced to show her versatility. There is some evidence that William also incorporated more intimate experiences: Sir Edward's wife, Eliza, an ideal of womanhood, seems to be based on William's ward, Eliza, who died tragically young of consumption, but not before, the family correspondence suggests, causing some disquiet about her real status in William's life  (Porter family correspondence, MS E).<br>
<br>After this joint adventure Jane Porter's personal and literary life declined, yet she bore the decline courageously. Her mother died aged eighty-six in 1831, and Anna Maria tragically of typhus, in Bristol in 1832. Jane's earlier fame had not secured her fortune and she was obliged to live largely with and off friends in London and in the country. She failed to obtain a civil-list pension, though she did get a grant of &pound;50 from the Literary Fund in 1842. She occupied herself preparing her novels for new editions in which her retrospective prefaces offer a distinctive voice and valuable biographical information. She still managed to go into society and mostly seems to have been liked and respected. She even, her diary indicates, formed a sentimental, probably motherly, attachment to the American writer Nathaniel Willis.<br>
<br>Comments on Porter's appearance abound. There is Haydon's celebrated story of Lord Abercorn, who, having invited the Porter sisters and paid their travel, sneaked a secret look at his guests, pronounced them frights, and left the house until they had gone. Mostly, however, Jane Porter was found handsome: dark and stately, she was dubbed &#145;Il Penseroso&#146; by S. C. Hall, as opposed to Anna Maria's fair and lively &#145;L'Allegro&#146;. Miss Mitford found Porter the only literary lady not &#145;fit for a scarecrow&#146;  (L'Estrange, 2.152), but Lady Morgan found her ill-dressed, &#145;lackadaisical&#146; with the &#145;air of a regular Melpomene&#146;  (Owenson, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.396). Maginn, however, remarks that even in her later years she had a &#145;long and handsome face&#146;  (Maginn, 404).<br>
<br>Porter's most energetic exploit during her nomadic years had a sad conclusion. Robert Ker Porter returned from Caracas to see his married daughter, Nina Kikine, in St Petersburg, and in 1842 Jane travelled there to meet him, only to find herself bringing his remains back to England, after his death from apoplexy. His affairs, once settled, brought little benefit to Jane. A last accolade was a gift of a rosewood armchair sent in October 1844 by the mayor of New York from the booksellers, publishers, and authors of that city. Jane Porter retired about 1847 to William's home at 29 Portland Square, Bristol, where, exhausted, she died on 24 May 1850. She was buried in St Paul's churchyard there, and with William, Robert, and Anna Maria was commemorated in a tablet in Bristol Cathedral.<br>
