<span class="headword">Maginn,  Edward</span>  (1802&#150;1849), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop</span>, the son of Patrick Maginn, a farmer, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Slevin, was born at Fintona, co. Tyrone, on 16 December 1802; his uncle was a Catholic priest. He was educated at the Irish College in Paris from 1818 and in 1825 returned to Ireland, where he was ordained priest and appointed to the curacy of Moville, co. Donegal. Some time afterwards he took part in a public debate held at Londonderry between protestant and Catholic champions. In 1829 he was appointed to succeed his uncle as parish priest of the united parishes of Fahan and Deysertegny, co. Donegal. During this period he ardently supported Daniel O'Connell and joined in the agitation for the repeal of the union. On 18 August 1845 Maginn was appointed coadjutor to John MacLaughlin, bishop of Derry, and was nominated to the see of Ortosia, in the archbishopric of Tyre, <i>in partibus infidelium</i>. The election was confirmed by the pope on 8 September and Maginn was consecrated in the cathedral at Londonderry's Waterside on 18 January 1846.<br>
<br>A politically minded bishop, Maginn promoted all the nationalist and clerical movements of his time. He gave evidence to Lord Devon's commission on the occupation of land in Ireland, wrote a series of letters on tenant right, and published <span class="italic">A Refutation of Lord Stanley's Calumnies Against the Catholic Clergy of Ireland</span> to defend the loyalty of Catholic subjects against an anti-Catholic polemic of 1847 which had stressed the &#145;dual allegiance&#146; of Catholics to pope and crown and suggested that the confessional was pernicious, arguing in effect that Roman Catholicism undermined the safe and peaceful governing of Ireland. Maginn died of typhus on 17 January 1849 at St Columb's College, Londonderry, and was buried in Buncrana, co. Donegal, on 22 January. He was eulogized in <span class="italic">A Life of &hellip; Maginn &hellip; with Selections from his Correspondence</span> by T. D'Arcy McGee, the only biography, published in New York in 1857.<br>
<br>Thompson Cooper<span class="italic">, rev. </span> David Huddleston </div>
