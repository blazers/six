<span class="headword">Eth&eacute;,  (Carl) Hermann</span>  (1844&#150;1917), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born in Germany at Stralsund, Pomerania (Prussia), on 13 February 1844, the son of Franz Eth&eacute;, an official land surveyor, and his wife, Mathilde, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lappe. He read classics at the University of Greifswald and then oriental philology at Leipzig with Heinrich L. Fleischer, one of the leading Arabic scholars of that period. In 1868 he presented his final thesis to the University of Munich, and was thereby admitted as a private lecturer. During his Munich years he translated from Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, and contributed essays on oriental subjects and German literature to general magazines, selections from which were published in <span class="italic">Morgenlaendische Studien</span> (1870) and <span class="italic">Essays und Studien</span> (1872).<br>
<br>In 1872 Eth&eacute; was invited by the Bodleian Library, Oxford, to continue the cataloguing of its oriental manuscripts. At the same time, he was entrusted with the preparation of a catalogue of the Persian manuscripts in the library of the India Office. First volumes of each catalogue appeared respectively in 1889 and 1903, but the printing was in both cases only completed after Eth&eacute;'s death. He was married to Anna Francisca (1848/9&#150;1897), also of Prussian origin; they had a daughter, who died in infancy. In 1875 Eth&eacute; was appointed as professor at University College, Aberystwyth. For nearly forty years there he taught not only several oriental languages, but also German and Italian.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Eth&eacute; continued to work on the manuscripts in Oxford and London, and contributed many articles on Persian literature to learned journals in Germany. Apart from his articles on Persian subjects in the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1885), nearly all his publications were written in German. During the 1880s he applied in vain for academic chairs in Germany and for the Laudian chair of Arabic at Oxford University. After the death of his first wife he married, on 11 July 1899 at Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire, Harriet Dora (1869&#150;1947), daughter of Abraham Phillips, fish and game dealer.<br>
<br>Though he had settled down permanently in Britain, Eth&eacute; kept his German nationality, which brought him into great difficulty at the outbreak of the First World War. In Munich when war broke out, he was invited by the college authorities to return to Aberystwyth, but anti-German demonstrations against him by the town's residents forced him to leave. He was defended by T. F. Roberts, the college's principal, and received private financial assistance from his colleagues at Aberystwyth until, in June 1915, he agreed to resign on a small pension. Although an application for naturalization as a British subject was unsuccessful, he was able to remain in Britain, and lived with his brother-in-law's family in Reading. When, in 1916, it became known that Eth&eacute; was still allowed to work on the India Office manuscripts, the government was accused in the House of Commons of being too lenient to a German who might very well be a spy.<br>
<br>Eth&eacute; left a vivid impression on the minds of several students and colleagues at Aberystwyth. They remembered him as a short, thickset man, who was witty and good-humoured in spite of disappointments in his academic career. Though he never bothered to adapt himself to his foreign environment, he was generally respected for his great learning. He died at 29 Royal York Crescent, Clifton, Bristol, on 7 June 1917, and was buried four days later in Canford cemetery, Bristol.<br>
<br>Eth&eacute;'s catalogues, which cover two of the largest collections of Persian manuscripts in the world, are his greatest scholarly achievement. They are particularly valuable because of the meticulous descriptions which laid a solid foundation for further studies. Yet his ambition went beyond the mere recording of philological data. Many of his publications deal with important questions of literary history, which he was often the first to raise. The long article which he wrote for the <span class="italic">Grundriss der iranischen Philologie</span> (1894&#150;1904) is an authoritative survey of western knowledge about Persian literature at the end of the nineteenth century.<br>
