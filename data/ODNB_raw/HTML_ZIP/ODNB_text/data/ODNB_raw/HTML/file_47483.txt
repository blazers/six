<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Isaac</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1695, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">iron-founder</span>, was baptized on 6 May 1695 at Washington, co. Durham, the son of John Wilkinson and his wife, Margaret Thompson. He was the fifth child, his mother dying after his birth. His father having died by 1704, Isaac was brought up by his elder brother John, a wool merchant. His education is unknown; he had a rough literacy and could keep accounts, sometimes creatively. He was apprenticed to the iron trade, probably at the Swalwell works near his home. About 1721&#150;3 he moved to Little Clifton furnace near Workington, where he stayed until 1735. On 9 November 1727, described as iron-founder, he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1786), daughter of Henry and Margaret Johnson of Briggham, Cumberland. She was a dissenter, and Wilkinson is henceforward referred to as a Presbyterian. Their seven children included the ironmasters <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29428/', "John Wilkinson")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47484/', "William Wilkinson")</script>, and Mary (1743&#150;1796), who later married the theologian and natural philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22788/', "Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804)")</script>.<br>
<br>A highly skilled iron-founder, Wilkinson commanded high wages before going to Clifton. The furnace there had converted to smelting with coal and charcoal; and Wilkinson cast on contract. In 1735 he moved to Backbarrow furnace, again smelting with coke as a specialist founder. As well as casting on contract, he bought iron from the firm, casting for sale on his own account. In 1738 he obtained a patent, partly for cast box smoothing-irons, though he must have known that Baddeley of Birmingham had a similar 1722 patent, which had lately expired. Isaac, with his brother John as partner, subsequently bought a mill for finishing the irons. However, he cheated his brother over the profits due to him, and their partnership in consequence ended. He had additional works, possibly a furnace, at Wilson House, Cartmel, where he now lived.<br>
<br>In 1747, with the Rowlinson family and others, Wilkinson set up the Lowwood iron company on a site very close to Backbarrow. In the course of the following year he ceased to cast for the Backbarrow Company. In 1749 he withdrew from the Lowwood Company too, but bought iron for casting from them. He went to law with the Lowwood Company and others over his box iron patent and their enticement of his workers, when it became clear his patent was not original. In 1753 Isaac Wilkinson left Lancashire and took over a furnace at Bersham, near Wrexham, Denbighshire, earlier used for both charcoal and coke smelting. His elder son John became superintendent of the coke-iron furnace; and Isaac's partners were his brother-in-law William Johnson, the Liverpool merchant Samuel Green, and the Shrewsbury capitalist Edward Blakeway. Railed ways, air furnaces, and mills for working iron were built, while a nearby furnace at Ruabon was bought. As well as overseeing these developments, Isaac continued to charge separate fees for casting.<br>
<br>In 1757 Wilkinson took out a patent for a cylinder-blowing engine. Its development is obscure, but originally the blast was to be produced by water columns, recalling the French <i>trempe</i> system. The blast could supposedly be provided by pipes at some distance from the power source. Tried at Bersham, New Willey, Shropshire (where his son John was a partner), and at the furnaces Isaac later used in south Wales, it does not appear to have been effective. Yet Charles Wood, the manager of the Cyfarthfa ironworks, saw Wilkinson's cylinders in action at neighbouring Dowlais in 1766 and was impressed: &#145;they are by much preferable to any Leathern Bellows, &amp; require much less water in proportion to their Blast&#146;  (Charles Wood's journal, 22 May 1766). John Wilkinson had ironed out the problems by the mid-1770s, however, when he was successfully using steam-powered and cylinder-blown blast in his furnaces. Isaac Wilkinson's Bersham partner Blakeway went bankrupt in 1759, and the latter's shares passed to his sister-in-law Mary Lee. She became the main shareholder in 1762, and married Wilkinson's son John in 1763, giving him control at Bersham. The works there subsequently acquired an international reputation for quality castings, especially for steam engine cylinders and solid-bored cannon. In 1758 Isaac took out a patent for dry sand moulding in a flask or box, which seems to have had real originality.<br>
<br>As early as 1762 Wilkinson sued his partners, including his son John, over his remuneration for casting. When the partnership broke up in the post-war depression Isaac sued the others over the finances. He then moved to Bristol, and Bersham was put up for sale. However, John Wilkinson emerged as effective owner in 1766. Isaac was awarded over &pound;1000 and costs, but after renewed litigation settlement was reached in 1767. At the same time John Wilkinson agreed payments to his father for his casting and blowing patents, though Isaac remained in legal dispute with another partner.<br>
<br>Isaac Wilkinson was subsequently an iron-founder at Bristol, but had brief but interesting involvements with the Dowlais and Plymouth ironworks in south Wales. He also introduced the Guest family to the south Wales industry. Local master colliers supplied him with coal for his furnace at Cyfarthfa, but this led to further lawsuits, which showed Wilkinson in financial difficulties. In the 1770s he sued the Bersham and New Willey companies, both now run by his son John, over patent fees; and as late as 1779 he was again at law about a bad investment in a Gloucestershire furnace. He died in London on 31 January 1784, but was probably buried at Bristol.<br>
<br>Isaac Wilkinson's career was long, complex, and often fraught. A great craftsman, his business sense often did not equal his technical skill, and he was invariably involved in disputes that led to litigation. His headstrong nature was inherited by his more famous sons, John and William. Wilkinson had some genuine inventive talent; and the frequency with which he was admitted to new coke-smelting partnerships in the 1750s, 1760s, and 1770s, though he had very little in the way of money to contribute, suggests that his new blowing technology, to which his partners gained privileged access, was seen as having value.<br>
