<span class="headword">Hibbert, Sir  Jack</span>  (1932&#150;2005), <span class="occ">statistician and civil servant</span>, was born at the Huddersfield Municipal Maternity Home, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, on 14 February 1932, the only child of William Collier Hibbert, a grocery branch manager, later master baker, and his wife, Ivy Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wigglesworth. After education at Leeds grammar school (1942&#150;9) he gained entry to the civil service in 1950. He spent the next two years on national service with the Royal Air Force, then worked with the Exchequer and Audit Department in London and, from 1955, at the War Pensions Office near Blackpool. On 27 April 1957, in Selby, Yorkshire, he married Joan Clarkson (<i>b</i>. 1933), also an assistant auditor in the Exchequer and Audit Department, and daughter of Francis Clarkson, railway storeman. They subsequently had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>To improve his prospects Hibbert joined the Central Statistical Office (CSO) in London on 2 October 1960. His talents were quickly recognized, but a suitable university degree was needed for the top posts. Studying part-time and then full-time in 1965&#150;6, Hibbert graduated BSc (Econ) at the London School of Economics. Returning to the CSO as a statistician, he enhanced further his already considerable reputation in national accounting, a subject that fascinated him. He became a chief statistician in 1970 and an assistant director in 1977.<br>
<br>Hibbert also came to be highly regarded in national accounting circles beyond the United Kingdom. He made a favourable impression at the 1975 conference of the International Association of Research in Income and Wealth. Participating frequently in later conferences, he served on the association's council from 1985 to 1992. In 1981, when high inflation had led to concerns about accounting conventions, the OECD and Eurostat commissioned Hibbert to examine the treatment of inflation in national accounts. The problems highlighted in his report, <span class="italic">Measuring the Effects of Inflation on Income, Saving, and Wealth</span> (1983), were among those addressed later in the review of the international system of national accounts. Hibbert might have been expected to make a major contribution to the review, but, following a period as under-secretary in the Department of Trade and Industry (1982&#150;5), in 1985 he succeeded Sir John Boreham as director of the CSO and head of the Government Statistical Service, holding the post until 1992. He did, though, help to ensure that the review was brought to a conclusion when differences threatened to prolong it unduly. The outcome then provided the basis also of the EU's own system.<br>
<br>Hibbert became head of the Government Statistical Service when cuts had weakened it and there was mounting criticism, particularly of the reliability of unemployment statistics&#151;revised following changes to benefit rules. In 1987 and 1988 discrepancies within the national accounts became so large that it was unclear how the economy was developing. The Treasury and civil service select committee called for an investigation. The Pickford review, launched in June 1988, resulted in the transfer of more responsibilities to the CSO and the establishment of the much enlarged CSO as a separate department. The major changes introduced in 1989 under Hibbert's leadership provided the basis for subsequent improvements to the quality of economic statistics, and were also the first of several involving greater centralization in UK official statistics.<br>
<br>The changes were, however, not those sought by critics outside government. In November 1989 the Royal Statistical Society established a working party on official statistics. In December 1989 the society and the Institute of Statisticians convened a meeting about public confidence in official statistics. Hibbert's written reply to the criticisms, published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Statistical Society</span> (1990), reveals especially clearly his thinking about the issues. The society's working party &#145;found no evidence of a lack of integrity among government statisticians&#146;, but considered that &#145;the organisational and operational framework&#146; had to be changed  (&#145;Official statistics: counting with confidence&#146;, <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Statistical Society</span>, series A, 154, 1991, 23&#150;44). Its recommendations had little impact on the Conservative administration, but had more appeal to the Labour Party, which gained power in 1997. Hibbert was a member of the Royal Statistical Society's council for the sessions 1989&#150;93 and a vice-president in 1990&#150;91.<br>
<br>Hibbert was made KCB in 1990. He possessed integrity as well as technical expertise. Colleagues did not doubt that he would have resigned if required to do something he thought improper. He supported people facing difficulties. He was always calm, and in private had a friendly, sympathetic manner. He was less at ease with publicity and with press briefings, preferring to confine himself to issues he had considered carefully beforehand. In an address before he retired in 1992 he reflected on his experience and achievements (Hibbert, &#145;Official statistics&#146;).<br>
<br>In retirement Hibbert retained his interest in statistics. Comments in 2005 on the Atkinson report about measuring government output and productivity, and frequent letters to the press, demonstrated that he had lost little of his incisiveness. Nevertheless retirement allowed more time for other interests. Bridge had long been a passion and he became a national master. He and his wife, Joan, were members of Beckenham Bridge Club, whose <span class="italic">Newsletter</span> carried a warm tribute after his death. In major competitions he partnered primarily Tim Lloyd-Williams and Marie Horlock, devising with Lloyd-Williams a bidding system called &#145;compromised club&#146;. Hibbert and Robbie Kingston won the English Bridge Union senior pairs at Eastbourne in 2003. He was a member of the Reform Club; he and Joan enjoyed particularly meetings of the Thackeray Society, and they joined Hever Castle Golf Club, where in 1995 he won the seniors' cup. To Hibbert's amusement, his gambling successes provoked one national bookmaker to refuse his bets.<br>
<br>Joan Hibbert supported her husband throughout his career, and he valued her opinions. For several years after retirement, Hibbert found himself caring increasingly for her, with support from their family, as Alzheimer's disease developed. Care in a nursing home eventually became essential. In later years he enjoyed the company of a circle of friends, with his last few years enriched by a close friendship with Ann Ramsay. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease caused Hibbert's startlingly rapid decline and then death, on 23 August 2005 at the Princess Alice Hospice in Weybridge Hospital. His funeral, which was non-religious, took place on 6 September at Randalls Park crematorium, Leatherhead. He was survived by his wife, whose condition gradually deteriorated further, and by their three children.<br>
