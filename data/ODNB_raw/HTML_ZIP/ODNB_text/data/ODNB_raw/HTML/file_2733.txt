<span class="headword">Boag,  John</span>  (1775&#150;1863), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born at Highgate in the parish of Beith, Ayrshire, on 7 January 1775. He matriculated at the University of Glasgow in 1797, and completed his course with a view to taking orders in the Church of Scotland. However, he joined the body of Independents or Congregationalists who in 1812 formed themselves into the Congregational Union of Scotland. He acted for many years as an evangelist, and not infrequently in the open air or by the wayside. He had small charges in the Isle of Man and Helensburgh. Ultimately he accepted the appointment of pastor over a very small Independent congregation in the village of Blackburn, Linlithgowshire, from which, it is believed, he never received more than &pound;25&#150;30 a year. He married Agnes Hamilton on 19 June 1798; they had six sons and three daughters. One of his sons was Sir Robert Boag, mayor of Belfast.<br>
<br>Boag kept a day school on his own account, and it was in this humble position that he compiled his <i>magnum opus</i>, the <span class="italic">Imperial Lexicon</span>. His aim was to combine etymology, pronunciation, and explanations of scientific terms and others used in art and literature. He wished also to incorporate new words that had emerged since Dr Johnson's dictionary, and to include modifications and other changes of meaning. He began this arduous undertaking after he had entered his seventieth year. Within three years his manuscript was ready for the press. It was printed and published by the Edinburgh Printing and Publishing Company. Unfortunately this company speedily became bankrupt. About 1847 Messrs Fullarton &amp; Co. became proprietors of the <span class="italic">Imperial Lexicon</span> and issued it in parts or numbers, constituting two massive volumes. The work had an enormous sale and held its own until the publication of John Ogilvie's <span class="italic">Imperial Dictionary of the English Language</span>, which drew on it. Prefixed was a &#145;Popular grammar of the English language&#146; by R. Whyte.<br>
<br>Besides his <span class="italic">Imperial Lexicon</span>, Boag was the author of a number of pamphlets on questions of the day, and was a frequent contributor to contemporary religious periodicals. He died at Craigton House, Linlithgowshire&#151;the residence of a daughter-in-law, with whom he had lived in his later years&#151;on 15 September 1863, in his eighty-ninth year.<br>
