<span class="headword">Loch,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">shipowner and writer</span>, is a figure about whose early life nothing is known. He graduated from being a shipmaster to become one of the leading merchants at the port of Leith, claiming to have sent, in the course of his career, some hundreds of ships to the Baltic and to the continent. He had, therefore, considerable firsthand knowledge of Scotland's trade, which he put to good effect.<br>
<br>In the 1770s Loch wrote a series of well-argued pamphlets which, reworked with additions, he gathered into a three-volume work, <span class="italic">Essays on the Trade, Commerce, Manufactures and Fisheries of Scotland</span> (1778). This covers a wide range of topics from British trade in general to the need to complete the Forth and Clyde Canal, then stalled for want of the necessary finance. The work provides a sympathetic account of Ireland's trade and of the penalties under which Irish traders laboured, and a supplement on what Loch called &#145;the unhappy dispute with the American Colonies&#146;  (Loch, 1.xli). In addition Loch describes the state of fishing in the highlands and islands, based on personal reconnaissance, and the condition of east coast fishing towns, which he knew from having made a tour of inspection in August and September 1778.<br>
<br>In the second volume the &#145;Tour through the trading villages of Scotland&#146; provides a thorough account of the manufacturing being carried on in some 140 Scottish towns and burghs, from Alloa to Whitburn. Loch sought out statistical detail as to the value of output and the numbers employed in the leading trades, his work in many respects anticipating that of Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (1791&#150;9). Dundee, for example, he describes as having a population of about 14,000, of whom 2800 were linen weavers; the town had three tanneries, a large thread manufacture, and a thriving economy. Loch's &#145;Tour&#146;, however, is no mere accounting exercise: his descriptions are enlivened by a keen eye for the social consequences of economic growth. The prosperity of Paisley, for example, he finds reflected in the maidservants' being allowed free time every Thursday evening to go dancing: &#145;this practice promotes matrimony and contributes much to inspire in the minds of the people a desire to be neat and clean in their dress. The men marry here when they are twenty, the girls at seventeen&#146;  (Loch, 2.52).<br>
<br>The issue which most concerned Loch in all his writings, however, was the need to encourage Scotland's woollen industry, at a time when much official help was being given to the linen manufacturers. He pointed out how much flax had to be imported from either Holland or the Baltic, which made the linen industry, in his words, both &#145;exotic&#146; and &#145;precarious&#146;. Loch was all too aware of the risks of the trade, having been taken prisoner by a French privateer on one of his voyages back from the Baltic during the Seven Years' War. By contrast, he argued, Scotland could provide all the raw wool it needed for manufacture from domestic sources, were more attention given to improving the home supply by way of prizes for sheep-breeding. The force of his arguments and of his expertise were recognized in 1776 when the Edinburgh-based board of trustees appointed him their chief inspector for both fisheries and woollen manufactures, a position he held until his death. In July of the same year the Convention of Royal Burghs, in which Loch served for several years as member for the fishing town of Dunbar, underscored his worth by passing a special motion thanking him for his zeal in promoting the manufactures of Scotland. He died on 14 February 1780 at St Anne's Yards, Holyrood, Edinburgh.<br>
