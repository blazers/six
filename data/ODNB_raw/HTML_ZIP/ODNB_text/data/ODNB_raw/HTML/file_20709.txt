<span class="headword">Oliphant,  Laurence</span>, fourth Lord Oliphant  (1529&#150;1593), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20708/', "Laurence Oliphant, third Lord Oliphant (d. 1566)")</script>, and Margaret, daughter of Sir James Sandilands of Calder. He succeeded his father on 2 May 1566 having in March 1551 married Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1594), daughter of George Hay, seventh earl of Erroll. They had six children: Laurence, master of Oliphant, John, William, Elizabeth, whose first husband was William Douglas, tenth earl of Angus, Jean, who married Alexander Bruce of Cultmalindie, and Euphame, wife of James Johnston of Westraw.<br>
<br>Oliphant was seldom a significant figure in public affairs during his relatively long life. His family had important estates in Caithness, and he was appointed justiciar there on 14 March 1557. Appointed a privy councillor in 1567, he attended infrequently. In the disorders of Mary's reign he initially sided with the queen, supporting her marriage to Bothwell, attending their wedding, and subsequently fighting on Mary's side at Langside on 13 May 1568. For this he was denounced as a rebel by the queen's enemies and put to the horn. Thereafter his allegiance wavered. On 6 January 1569 Mary named him as one of her counsellors, but by April he had moved into the regent Moray's camp, and at the convention held at Perth in July voted with the majority which rejected proceedings to divorce the queen from Bothwell, as a prelude to her marriage to the duke of Norfolk and possible restoration. After Moray's murder on 23 January 1570 Oliphant rejoined the queen's followers, and in April, following a meeting with some of the queen's adherents at Linlithgow, was a signatory to a letter on Mary's behalf to Queen Elizabeth requesting that she &#145;enter into such conditions with the Queen's Highness in Scotland as may be honourable for all parties&#146;  (Calderwood, 2.550). But he does not appear to have been otherwise active on Mary's behalf, and by the end of 1572 was said to be favourable to the king's party. He seems to have supported Morton throughout the latter's regency. In the 1560s Oliphant may have been a sympathizer with Catholicism, but in July 1585 he voted in favour of a league with England in defence of protestantism. In April 1589 he took part in James VI's campaign against the earl of Huntly, and attended a meeting of the privy council for the last time in February 1591.<br>
<br>Oliphant may not have taken a leading role in Scottish politics, but he undeniably achieved prominence through his involvement in a series of bitter feuds between his own and various other noble houses. In July 1569, for example, there was an attack on him and his servants by the earl of Caithness, highlighting a dispute with the contentious Sinclairs, earls of Caithness, which persisted through his lifetime. But the most spectacular and celebrated episode in which Oliphant was concerned was the one in November 1580, involving the powerful Ruthven family. The two families were near neighbours, both having substantial estates in Perthshire, and on this occasion, a disagreement over the right to certain teinds, a common cause of friction, resulted in the fourth lord's eldest son, the master of Oliphant, and his followers making an attack near Dupplin, a few miles south-west of Perth, on a party of Ruthvens and Stewarts as they returned from the marriage of the earl of Mar. In the violent exchanges which ensued, Alexander Stewart of Schutingleyis was struck by a bullet and killed. The upshot of this fracas was Oliphant's arrest followed by his trial for the murder of Stewart. The trial itself was a curious affair, with allegations at one point of the use of a poisoned bullet, but helped by Morton's backing Oliphant was eventually acquitted.<br>
<br>Rather surprisingly this verdict did not create a permanent breach with the Ruthvens and shortly afterwards the master of Oliphant was one of the participants in the Ruthven raid, the seizure of James VI in 1582 by the earl of Gowrie and his supporters. In 1584, as a result of his involvement in these events, Oliphant's son was exiled abroad where he met an uncertain fate. According to one account, following his capture by North Sea pirates &#145;he was hanged upon the mast of the ship&#146;  (Calderwood, 4.46), but another source has him incarcerated in Algiers, a prisoner of the Turks. Oliphant himself, still feuding with the Sinclairs, died in Wick, Caithness, on 16 January 1593, and was buried in Wick church.<br>
