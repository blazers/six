<span class="headword">Phillpotts <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Ross]</span>,  (Mary) Adelaide Eden</span>  (1896&#150;1993), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 23 April 1896 at Ealing, the only daughter and second of two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35518/', "Eden Phillpotts (1862&#150;1960)")</script>, writer, and his first wife, Emily (<i>d</i>. 1928), daughter of Robert Topham. Her publishing career spanned some seventy-five years and ended in 1991 with her last book, <span class="italic">The Beacon of Memory</span>. Compared with her father, who published over 225 books, her output was small. Between 1916 and 1991 she published forty-two books in a variety of genres&#151;novels, plays, and poems of great charm and considerable talent. Her works presented realistic portrayals of women experiencing the pressures and stresses of Victorian society. Her heroines (there were no heroes) embodied a capacity for suffering, a suspicion of middle-class values, and a distrust in the ability of men to make women happy.<br>
<br>After a period of education under a governess, Phillpotts went to a local boarding-school, Girton House, and later to Gressendale School, Southbourne. For a brief period (1915&#150;16) she worked with C. K. Ogden for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Magazine</span>. Her next phase of education consisted of one year of a full social science course at Bedford College, London. The Phillpotts family enjoyed numerous literary friendships, and Adelaide benefited from the frequent visits of well-known writers, including Agatha Christie (her neighbour in Devon), Thomas Hardy, and Arnold Bennett.<br>
<br>Phillpotts remained unmarried until the age of fifty-five. On 25 August 1951, at Newton Abbot register office and much against the wish of her father, she married an American bookseller from Boston named Nicholas Ross. Eden Phillpotts cut her off, and never met her after her marriage, despite several attempts by Adelaide at reconciliation. She remained happily married to Nicholas Ross until he died on 28 July 1967.<br>
<br>Phillpotts's relationship with her father was somewhat unusual. Father and daughter collaborated often on writing projects and were joint authors of <span class="italic">Yellow Sands</span> (1926), <span class="italic">The Good Old Days</span> (1932), <span class="italic">West Country Plays</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">My Lady's Mill</span> (1935). They dedicated books to each other and Eden Phillpotts even wrote sonnets for her. According to Adelaide, this father&#150;daughter relationship extended beyond literary collaboration and fatherly affection to incest, extreme jealousy, and cruelty on his part. She told her own side of this story in <span class="italic">Reverie: an Autobiography</span> (1981), published under her married name:<blockquote>He had begun deeply to love me. I think he looked on me as an extension of himself, for he would take me into his bed and fondle me, compare my limbs with his and say &#145; Look! Your hands and feet are just like small editions of mine. You are so like me. And you are going to be a writer too.&#146; He kissed me all over and said: &#145;You must never marry!&#146; At six or seven that meant nothing to me. Yet I did not forget those words, which all through my youth and afterwards were repeated. I loved him too but only as a father, and for fear of hurting him I let him do whatever he liked. (Ross, 29)</blockquote>Seven of Phillpotts's novels can be considered as a group, as all have, in addition to similar settings and themes, women as central characters: Janet Finlay in <span class="italic">A Marriage</span> (1928), Leah Vinnicome in <span class="italic">The Gallant Heart</span> (1939), Lily Lark in <span class="italic">The Round of Life</span> (1939), Elizabeth Broad in <span class="italic">Our Little Town</span> (1942), Jane Moor in <span class="italic">From Jane to John</span> (1943), Allison Westaway in <span class="italic">The Fosterling</span> (1949), and Hannah Northway in <span class="italic">Stubborn Earth</span> (1951). These heroines showed discontent with the male-dominated society that robbed them of the power to better their lot. The Phillpotts heroine was not a modern career woman, strong and independent, but a warm and sensitive woman, a good mother, and a not so submissive wife who was beginning to show the stirrings of &#145;women's liberation&#146;.<br>
<br>Phillpotts was a versatile writer. She tried her hand at several literary forms, including plays, historical novels, travel writing, poems, and autobiography. <span class="italic">Yellow Sands</span> (1926), written first as a play in collaboration with her father, was later at his wish turned into a novel (1930). The play ran successfully at the Haymarket Theatre for 610 performances. <span class="italic">Akhnaton</span> (1926), a historical play written in verse, presented the Egyptian pharaoh's revolutionary attempt to introduce &#145;one god&#146;, Aton, to his people in the fourteenth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. <span class="italic">Broken Allegiance</span> (1937) also dealt with a historical theme: Benedict Arnold's role in the American War of Independence. She also wrote two books of poems: <span class="italic">A Song of Man</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">A Wild Flower Wreath</span> (1975). In 1964 she and her husband travelled round the world. She wrote the story of this voyage in <span class="italic">Panorama of the World</span> (1969). Her autobiography, <span class="italic">Reverie</span> (1981), too, described extensive travels.<br>
<br>Phillpotts spent the last years of her life in the village of Kilkhampton, 6 miles north of Bude, Cornwall. After she became increasingly weak and almost blind, she moved into Trelana Nursing Home, Poughill, Bude. She died there on 4 June 1993 at the age of ninety-seven, having produced a body of work impressive in its range and richness. She was buried beside her husband at Morwenstow church, Cornwall.<br>
