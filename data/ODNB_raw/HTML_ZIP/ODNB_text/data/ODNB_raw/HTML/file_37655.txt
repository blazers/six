<span class="headword">Lapworth,  Charles</span>  (1842&#150;1920), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 20 September 1842, in Faringdon, Berkshire, the second son of a shopkeeper, James Lapworth (1813&#150;1889), and his wife, Martha Butler (1815&times;19&#150;1890). The family soon moved to a farm near Buckland in the Vale of the White Horse, and Lapworth was educated at Buckland national school, famous for its environmental approach to education. Following a period as a pupil-teacher he went, in 1862, to Culham Teacher Training College, gaining a first-class certificate in 1864.<br>
<br>Lapworth's first teaching post was as master of St Peter's Episcopalian School in Galashiels. In 1869 he married Janet, daughter of Walter Sanderson, a civic leader and industrialist of Galashiels. They had four children, three sons, one of whom died in infancy, and a daughter. One son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37654/', "Arthur Lapworth")</script>, became a professor of chemistry at Manchester University and fellow of the Royal Society, the second a well-known water engineer. Both his second son and daughter studied geology. It was in Galashiels that, as a hobby, he began the geological work which eventually led to the clarification and understanding of the structure of the southern uplands of Scotland. After collecting fossils in local rocks formerly thought unfossiliferous, Lapworth by 1870 had established the value of graptolites in identifying outcrops throughout the whole region. By 1872 he had begun correlating these outcrops, and as a result rejected the succession and comparatively simple structure favoured by the geological survey. Using graptolites as zonal fossils for the first time, he mapped the shale sequences in minute detail. He established the correct sequence of beds, and through this, the complex structure of the southern uplands as a series of isoclinal folds. He was also able to correlate rocks from the southern uplands with similar black shales in Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe. His work resulted in the rejection of the theory of &#145;Colonies&#146;, put forward by Joachim Barrande, and enabled the older Palaeozoic rocks to be classified and correlated in as great a detail as younger rocks. During this work he established a new methodology for the geologic mapping of any area, which involved minute and exact observation and recording on maps of large scale. Often he had to enlarge and draw these base maps himself. From his work in Scotland, and also that in Wales, Lapworth was able to redefine the divisions of the Lower Palaeozoic sub-era on the basis of distinctive faunas. He proposed the Ordovician period to separate the Cambrian from the Silurian, thus resolving the controversy between Adam Sedgwick and Sir Roderick Murchison over their classification.<br>
<br>During the later part of his researches in southern Scotland, Lapworth had moved, in 1875, to Madras College, St Andrews, as an English teacher. However, following publication of his early major works, especially the Moffat series, in 1881 he was appointed as the first professor of geology at Mason College (later the University of Birmingham). He held this post until his retirement in 1913. On arrival in Birmingham, Lapworth began work on the mapping of the north-west highlands of Scotland, where, with the application of his detailed mapping techniques and his knowledge of tectonics, he was able to determine the structural relationship of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks to the Precambrian, and establish the presence of the Moine thrust plane. He was one of the earliest workers in Britain to apply the theories on alpine tectonics of Esher von der Linth and Albert Heim to British geology. Such was his workload that in 1883, during the final stages of the work on the north-west highlands, he suffered a major breakdown. His findings, of major tectonic movements, were confirmed by the officers of the geological survey in the memoir published on the area. His later work on fold theory, which stemmed from this and earlier fieldwork, was ahead of its time, but stimulated many other workers in this field.<br>
<br>Between 1901 and 1918 Lapworth edited the classic monograph, <span class="italic">British Graptolites</span>, for which he also wrote the introduction. In total, he published sixty-nine papers: his early publications were based on the geology of specific localities in southern Scotland; later ones were wider in their geographical scope, and were increasingly concerned with the fossil content of the rocks, and the use made of this in determining the structure, and biostratigraphy. Eventually, papers were published that were specifically palaeontological, dealing with various aspects of the graptolites worldwide. Work on tectonics resulted in his papers on the north-west highlands, and thereafter on fold theory on a global scale.<br>
<br>Lapworth was always concerned with the economic implications of any geological studies and many of his publications reflect this. When in Birmingham he undertook a great deal of consultancy work, notably on water supply and building materials. Always conscious of the importance of geological education, he wrote and lectured throughout his professional life. He built up a large and successful department, and was an inspiring teacher, both in the lecture room and in the field. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1872, served on its council in 1894, and was its president in 1902. He was awarded the society's Lyell fund in 1882 and in 1884, the Bigsby medal in 1887, and the Wollaston medal, its highest award, in 1899. Lapworth was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1888 and a member of its council in 1895, and in 1891 was awarded its royal medal. He was president of Section C of the British Association in 1892. In 1905 he received the Wilde medal of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and he was awarded honorary LLDs by the universities of Aberdeen (1883) and Glasgow (1912). After an illness lasting several months, Lapworth died at his home, 38 Calthorpe Road, Edgbaston, on 13 March 1920. He was buried at the Lodge Hill cemetery, Birmingham. He was survived by his wife.<br>
