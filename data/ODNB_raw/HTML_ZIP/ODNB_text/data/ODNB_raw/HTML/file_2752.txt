<span class="headword">Bode,  John Ernest</span>  (1816&#150;1874), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was the son of William Bode, who worked for the Post Office, and his wife, Mary, only daughter of the Revd T. Lloyd of Peterly House, Oxfordshire. He was educated at Eton College and Charterhouse School, 1830&#150;34, where he became a scholar on the foundation. From Charterhouse he proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, and was the first winner, in 1835, of the Hertford scholarship, instituted the year before. He took his BA degree in 1837, with a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and his MA in 1840. He became a student and a tutor of his college, 1841&#150;7, of which he was appointed censor in 1844, and acted as one of the public examiners in <i>literae humaniores</i> for the years 1846&#150;8. He was ordained deacon in 1841, and priest in 1843. In 1847 he was presented by his college to the rectory of Westwell, Oxfordshire, and on 22 July in the same year was married to Hester Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lodge, of St Nicholas, Guildford.<br>
<br>In 1848 Bode was appointed one of the select preachers in the university, and on 12 December 1850, being founder's day, preached a sermon at the Charterhouse chapel, which was afterwards published as <span class="italic">Our Schoolboy Days Viewed through the Glass of Religion</span> (1850). In 1855 he preached the Bampton lectures before the University of Oxford, published as <span class="italic">The absence of precision in the formularies of the Church of England, scriptural and favourable to a state of probation</span> (1855). In 1857 Bode was defeated by Matthew Arnold in the election for the chair of poetry at Oxford; his claims rested mainly on a volume of poems suggested by a course of reading of the old English and Scottish ballads from 1841, published as <span class="italic">Ballads from Herodotus, with an Introductory Poem</span> (1853; 2nd edn with four additional poems, 1854). Bode also published <span class="italic">Short Occasional Poems</span> (1858), and a smaller volume entitled <span class="italic">Hymns from the Gospel of the Day</span> (1860). In 1860 Bode was presented by the governors of Charterhouse to the living of Castle Camps, Cambridgeshire, at the rectory of which he died suddenly, at the age of fifty-eight, on 6 October 1874; he was survived by his wife.<br>
