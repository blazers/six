<span class="headword">Dence,  Marjorie Lillian</span>  (1901&#150;1966), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was born on 14 June 1901 at Fairhaven, Park Road, Teddington, Middlesex, the daughter of Ernest Martin Dence (<i>d</i>. 1937), brass-founder and company director, and his wife, Annie Eleanor Searle. Dence studied for an arts degree at London University. Her love of drama drew her to the University Dramatic Society, where she met David Steuart who was to become a lifelong friend and artistic partner.<br>
<br>After working as a theatre secretary and on the staff of a London theatre magazine, Marjorie Dence became an actress herself. In 1934 she joined the Greater London Theatre Company where she found David Steuart in the same cast. In the railway station, going home after a performance in Ilford, Steuart pointed to Perth on a large map, and suggested that it would be an ideal place to start a repertory theatre. By a strange coincidence, the following week the sale of Perth Theatre was advertised in <span class="italic">The Stage</span>. Ernest Dence purchased it for &pound;4000 and appointed his daughter as manager.<br>
<br>Marjorie Dence and David Steuart set off for Perth and with &pound;1000 of their own money and a great deal of hard work they refurbished the old theatre and assembled a company. On 23 September 1935 their first season began successfully with a performance of <span class="italic">The Rose without a Thorn</span> by Clifford Bax. The audience response was most encouraging. A further eighteen plays were presented in weekly repertory. This exacting schedule took a lot of stamina. Marjorie herself acted in several productions and at one time a warming-pan, which she held in the character of an innkeeper's wife, was used to hide the script for the next play which she had been studying in the wings. As well as being artistic director, Steuart acted in most productions.<br>
<br>Snow and icy roads during the first three months of 1936 resulted in depleted audiences and strained finances. The company gallantly accepted a cut in salaries and Dence tentatively asked the people of Perth for a guarantee of &pound;500. Donations, to be no less than 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and no more than &pound;10, flooded in. The sum was reached in a fortnight. Admirably the guarantee was never called upon. In October 1938 an invitation to give a command performance was received from Balmoral. The play chosen was a thriller, <span class="italic">The Fourth Wall</span>, by A. A. Milne and the actors played on a small stage specially erected in the ballroom. The audience included King George VI and Queen Elizabeth as well as members of the royal household, guests, and tenants from the estate. Supper and an overnight stay were enjoyed by the company. The resulting publicity was invaluable.<br>
<br>In June 1939 the city of Perth provided a lovely setting for Scotland's first theatre festival. Marjorie Dence devised the programme and James Bridie not only agreed to be patron but contributed a new comedy, <span class="italic">The Golden Legend of Shults</span>. The event was a huge success and there was even a small profit. Despite the outbreak of war in September Dence and Steuart kept the theatre going, realizing the importance of entertainment for the community. The actors got board and lodging; some slept in the theatre itself, and rations were pooled to make their evening meal, served well before the audience came in. Salaries came from equal division of any box-office profits.<br>
<br>In 1941 the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) announced that grants would be made to any company prepared to take plays to remote areas of Scotland. As a result, Perth Theatre began annual tours of villages throughout Scotland, taking plays to the highlands and islands, the borders, and Orkney and Shetland. The company visited over 120 different venues from 1941 onwards as well as 20 in Northern Ireland, in addition to maintaining the regular season in Perth. In 1946 Perth and Kinross councils took on the financial responsibility, thus creating a civic theatre, putting Dence and Steuart on generous salaries as business manager and artistic director.<br>
<br>The theatre established by Marjorie Dence has remained a distinguished centre for the arts in Scotland. Her work was first recognized by her appointment as MBE in 1952, and in 1957 the twenty-first anniversary of the theatre was commemorated with a presentation plaque from the Scottish Arts Council. During Marjorie's tenure in Perth Theatre many eminent artistes played there. These included such theatrical luminaries as Alec Guinness, James Cairncross, Sophie Stewart, Gordon Jackson, John Laurie, Russell Hunter, Una McLean, Walter Carr, Edith MacArthur, and Martyn James. Plays presented included works by Shakespeare, G. B. Shaw, J. M. Barrie, and James Bridie, as well as some culled from the current West End successes. Among the assistants who trained there was Joan Knight, who later became a distinguished incumbent of the director's post.<br>
<br>Marjorie Dence was a highly respected figure in Perth, where she served as a JP. Her annual garden party, given at the beginning of each season, was a popular event with the Theatre Club. Just before the season began in August 1966 Marjorie hosted the party from a wheelchair because of a broken ankle. The next day she held a dinner party for some actors from the company. Sadly an unexpected complication set in and she died suddenly the following evening, 23 August 1966, at her home, Boatland, Isla Road, Perth. Her body was cremated on 26 August. Her will stated that the theatre was to be sold to the city of Perth for &pound;5000, the exact initial outlay. The money she had lost throughout the years she dismissed with the typical remark, &#145;That money brought me much happiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perth Advertiser</span>, 31 Aug 1966, 1).<br>
