<span class="headword">Sanderson,  William</span>  (1547/8&#150;1638), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the eldest son of William Sanderson (<i>d</i>. 1570) and his wife, Jane, formerly Wall. The Sanderson family had moved from Pontefract to London in the person of the younger William's grandfather Stephen Sanderson (<i>d</i>. 1495). Sanderson learnt the merchant's trade under Thomas Allin, and travelled widely in Denmark, Poland, Germany, France, and the Low Countries. At some time before 1592 he joined the Fishmongers' Company and was on the court of assistants until he moved from London in 1595, although he was a member until his death. He was well known in Elizabeth's court, and to the duke of Norfolk, and lords Burghley and Leicester.<br>
<br>His travelling days over, Sanderson was a wealthy man; in addition to his trading profits, he had inherited property in several counties of England and in Ireland. His first London house was in the parish of St Magnus the Martyr, by London Bridge. He married, probably about 1584&#150;5, Margaret, daughter of Hugh Snedale of Cornwall and his wife, a sister of Sir Walter Ralegh. The names of a daughter and seven sons are known, the eldest being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24630/', "Sir William Sanderson (1586&#150;1676)")</script>, while three others bore the names of his friends: Ralegh, Cavendish, and Drake. Sanderson was eager to invest in new ventures. Henry Lane of the Muscovy Company compiled for him an account of voyages to the Russian Arctic between 1553 and 1583, but Sanderson seems to have rejected this route in favour of a north-west passage to the riches of the Orient. He funded Martin Frobisher's three voyages towards Greenland and Baffin Island. The family connection with Ralegh was supported by Sanderson's purse: he several times stood bond for Ralegh, for sums said to exceed &pound;100,000, and indemnified Ralegh's exploits in Virginia between 1584 and 1590. He provided the majority of the money that, supplemented by the merchants of Exeter, funded John Davis's voyages of 1585&#150;7, and Sanderson's own ship <i>Sunshine</i>, with his servants travelling as supercargo, accompanied Davis on all three voyages. Although China eluded him, Davis brought back from Greenland a profitable cargo of sealskins, and on his last voyage reached 72&deg;41' N, where he named two prominent features, Sanderson's Tower on Baffin Island and, on the Greenland side, Hope Sanderson.<br>
<br>Sanderson also supported Emery Molyneux, the first English globe maker. His large terrestrial and celestial globes were published in 1592 and presented to Queen Elizabeth at Greenwich. A second terrestrial globe, bearing Sanderson's newly bestowed arms and a declaration of his patronage, was presented to the queen at an entertainment at Sanderson's house in Newington Butts, to the south of London. As a farmer of the Mines Royal, Sanderson visited Derbyshire, Worcestershire, and Devon; in 1600 he was among the company shareholders accused of misbehaviour at the Isleworth brassworks and in 1602 he was named in an action in Star Chamber.<br>
<br>In the latter days of Queen Elizabeth Sanderson was involved in an examination of the mechanism of foreign exchange; his report survives as BL, Harley MS 5208, fols. 50&#150;52. He also oversaw the business of goods coming into Leadenhall during the years about the accession of James I. In 1594 Sanderson was in Devon making final arrangements with Ralegh and his associates for a voyage to Guiana. In view of the hazardous nature of this enterprise, Sanderson presented Ralegh with an account of the expenses, a release was signed and then altered, to operate in the event of Ralegh's death. But Ralegh accused Sanderson of dishonest accounting and Sanderson thought the altered release a forgery. They parted in anger; the matter eventually went to Star Chamber in 1613, although there is no record of the outcome. When Ralegh was executed in 1618 Sanderson was obliged to go to law in order to recover the considerable sums owing to him.<br>
<br>In the early decades of the seventeenth century Sanderson was beset by troubles, probably caused by unwise investments in voyages and properties, as well as expensive litigation. He spent at least seven years in prison between 1613 and 1622, at first in the Gatehouse at Westminster, then in the Fleet. The evidences given by his enemies at the Star Chamber hearings present him as a ruined and broken man. In 1656 his son, Sir William Sanderson, published <span class="italic">A compleat history of the lives and reigns of Mary queen of Scotland, and of her son King James, of Great Britain, France and Ireland, the sixth</span> in which he blackened Ralegh's actions and character; in reply, Ralegh's son Carew Ralegh published, anonymously, a pamphlet attacking the author and his father, in which he stated that William Sanderson had died in a debtors' prison. This in turn led Sir William Sanderson to issue <span class="italic">An Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet Intituled &#145;Observations &hellip;&#146;</span>, which presented his father in a better light. This account reveals that Sanderson died at his house in the Strand, Westminster, in 1638, aged ninety, and that his body was embalmed for several months before being buried in the parish church of the Savoy. The Savoy Chapel was at this time serving the parishioners of St Mary-le-Strand, their church having been demolished about 1548. He was said to have left lands to his children, but no will has been found. Of his sons, Drake Sanderson and another son pursued Ralegh in his last voyage, Drake dying at San Domingo in the West Indies. A third son died while on Captain Weymouth's voyage to the Arctic in 1602, and a fourth, possibly Hugh (<i>d</i>. 1624), in the East Indies. A fifth, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1635), fought with the Dutch against the Portuguese, in the East Indies, eventually taking over 2000 men by sea to Russia to fight at Smolensk.<br>
