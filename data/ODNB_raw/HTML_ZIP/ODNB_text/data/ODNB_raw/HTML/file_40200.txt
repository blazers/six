<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shaw,  Charles James Dalrymple</span>, Baron Kilbrandon  (1906&#150;1989), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 15 August 1906 in Martnaham, near Maybole, Ayrshire, the only son and second of three children of James Edward Shaw, of High Greenan by Ayr, solicitor and county clerk of Ayrshire, and his wife, Gladys Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lester. He was educated at Charterhouse School, Balliol College, Oxford, and Edinburgh University. He obtained a second class in philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford (1928) and an LLB at Edinburgh (1932).<br>
<br>Shaw was called to the Scottish bar in 1932. In 1937 he married (Ruth) Caroline, youngest daughter of Frank Morrison Seafield Grant, landowner, of Knockie, Whitebridge, Inverness; they had two sons and three daughters. By 1939 he had a substantial junior practice, had been commissioned as a territorial officer in the Royal Artillery, and had sustained a knee injury while skiing, which made him lame for the rest of his life. In 1939 he was mobilized and served in the Royal Artillery, mostly on the staff in the rank of major (from 1941), until the end of the Second World War in 1945. On his return to the bar his practice rapidly increased. He took silk in 1949. It then became clear that, despite a tendency to be unbusinesslike and absent-minded, he was destined for the highest appointments. (He was liable to be found in Kilbrandon on the coast of Argyll, having forgotten a professional engagement in Edinburgh. The unaccountably missing brief would be found among his much-loved music.)<br>
<br>In 1957 Shaw was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates, the highest honour which can be conferred on a member of the Scots bar. As dean, he was an anxious guardian of the faculty's traditions. In May 1959 he was appointed to the bench of the Court of Session, taking the judicial title of Lord Kilbrandon. From the outset he displayed the highest judicial qualities&#151;complete impartiality, patience and courtesy, legal scholarship, and a determination not to be prevented from doing justice by any rules of mere procedural law. His judicial career in Scotland ended with his appointment in 1965 as chairman of the Scottish Law Commission, for he retained that office until his elevation to the House of Lords in 1971, as a life peer, privy councillor, and lord of appeal in ordinary. As chairman he found in Sir Leslie Scarman, the first chairman of the English Law Commission, a kindred spirit. Kilbrandon was also a member of the royal commission on the constitution from 1969 to 1972 and its chairman in 1972&#150;3. The commission's report was a major contribution to the contemporary debate on devolution. In 1969 he was elected an honorary fellow of Balliol, a distinction which he particularly cherished, and in 1974 he was elected visitor, a position he held until 1986. He became an honorary LLD of Aberdeen (1965) and an honorary DSc of Edinburgh (1970).<br>
<br>Kilbrandon's elevation to the Lords was predictable. For three years he sat as the junior Scottish colleague on the judicial committee of the octogenarian Baron Reid. In an apt obituary of Reid, Kilbrandon wrote: &#145;Counsel found him a formidable figure, and so did I&#146;. Kilbrandon, on the other hand, did not have it in him to be what Ronald Knox called an &#145;awful presence&#146;, unless dealing with someone whose conduct gave him no option. In a line of Scots who have become lords of appeal in ordinary, Kilbrandon was <i>sui generis</i>. Large of frame, heart, and mind, he had the traditional Scottish regard for legal principles but he had more. He had the breadth of outlook, culture, and philosophical learning of James Dalrymple, first Viscount Stair, the father of Scots law. Endowed with a verbal dexterity, analogous to the cartoonist's art, he was able to compress profound and novel ideas into a synoptic phrase. In his Hamlyn lectures (1966) he derided the civil jury as a mere &#145;bingo session&#146;. His observation in <i>Customs and Excise v. Thorn Electrical</i> (1975), that &#145;a modern Hampden would in many quarters be pilloried as a tax evader&#146;, was worthy of F. X. J. Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen. Kilbrandon's most lasting memorial may be the <span class="roman">Social Work (Scotland) Act</span> (1968), which arose from his report for the departmental committee on the treatment of children and young persons in Scotland (1964). Kilbrandon retired as a lord of appeal in ordinary in 1976.<br>
<br>Kilbrandon was an outstandingly handsome man. Over 6 feet in height, he was a striking figure in his Inverness cape, limping at a smart pace from Westminster to Gray's Inn, where he lived during term. He was elected an honorary bencher in 1971. Until almost seventy he retained a boyish appearance enhanced by his thick, wavy hair. In old age he enjoyed a peaceful retirement in the beautiful setting of Kilbrandon House on the island of Seil in Argyll. The essential Kilbrandon was the man of religion whose faith pervaded his life and outlook. He liked to speak of himself as a Catholic although he was, denominationally, a Scottish Episcopalian of high-church outlook. One who knew him well described him as &#145;a practising Christian&#146;. This was apt. His amiability, sweetness of character, freedom from prejudice, and kindness were all exceptional. He died from heart disease in Kilbrandon House, Balvicar, by Oban, Argyll, on 10 September 1989.<br>
