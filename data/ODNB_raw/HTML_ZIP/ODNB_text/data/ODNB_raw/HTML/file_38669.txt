<span class="headword">Edwardes <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Edwards]</span>,  George Joseph</span>  (1855&#150;1915), <span class="occ">musical theatre producer</span>, was born at Cleethorpe Road, Clee, near Great Grimsby, on 8 October 1855, the eldest son in the family of four sons and three daughters of James Edwards, comptroller of customs, and his wife, Eleanor Widdup. His parents were from Wexford in Ireland and George was brought up a Roman Catholic. After attending St James's College, Clee, without distinction, he was sent to London to cram for entry to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. But through his cousins the important Irish theatre managers John and Michael Gunn, he was quickly given the chance to work in the theatre world and he made his entr&eacute;e into the business at the age of twenty-one with a front-of-house job at Leicester's newly constructed Royal Opera House, run by former opera tenor Eliot Galer. He soon moved to London, and through the influence of Michael Gunn, who was an important financial partner in Richard D'Oyly Carte's production house, ended up working as treasurer at the Opera Comique during the initial runs of <span class="italic">The Pirates of Penzance</span> and <span class="italic">Patience</span> (1881). When Carte shifted his operation to the Savoy Theatre in the Strand, Edwards moved with him, and he was employed as acting manager at the new theatre during the productions of <span class="italic">Iolanthe</span> (1882), <span class="italic">Princess Ida</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> (1885). On 9 July 1885 Edwardes (who had by now added an &#145;e&#146; to his surname and &#145;Pius Nono&#146; to his forenames) married Julia Lavinia Gwynne (1859&#150;1934), a small-part player at the Savoy, daughter of David Putney, a publican. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1885 Edwardes left the Savoy and moved to the Gaiety Theatre. John Hollingshead, at the head of the Gaiety since its opening seventeen years earlier, and responsible for building it into one of London's most effective and popular theatres, was on the verge of retiring, and Edwardes had been chosen as his successor. The two managers worked together on the production of the Gaiety's 1885 Christmas show, <span class="italic">Little Jack Sheppard</span>, after which Hollingshead moved out and Edwardes took over the running of the theatre. In his thirty years as proprietor he was to establish the Gaiety as the single most important and popular theatre for musical productions in the world.<br>
<br>Hollingshead's legacy was a significant one. Not only did Edwardes inherit a theatre with a splendid reputation and an enthusiastic audience, he also inherited the beginnings of what would be a hugely popular resident company, headed by future stars Fred Leslie and Nellie Farren, and a highly profitable trend in musical plays. <span class="italic">Little Jack Sheppard</span> was the first of what became known as &#145;new burlesques&#146;, a full-length burlesque play (instead of one which was, as before, just one item on an evening's programme) with a score of original music rather than the second-hand songs previously used in such productions. It was also a notable hit, and Edwardes followed it up with more of the same (<span class="italic">Monte Cristo Jr</span>, <span class="italic">Miss Esmeralda</span>, <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span>, <span class="italic">Faust Up-To-Date</span>, <span class="italic">Ruy Blas, or The Blas&eacute; Rou&eacute;</span>, <span class="italic">Carmen up-to-Data</span>, <span class="italic">Cinder-Ellen up-too-Late</span>) and the &#145;new burlesques&#146; of the Gaiety Theatre went round the world as the young producer sent out companies through the British provinces, to America, and as far afield as Australia carrying repertoires of his shows.<br>
<br>Edwardes operated on numerous fronts from his headquarters at the Gaiety. While one of his companies played the Gaiety, a second toured. When the first took its latest show on the road, the other came back with a new production. Occasionally, too, he ventured with a production at another London theatre, and at other times he brought entertainments other than new burlesque into the Gaiety. On one famous occasion he mounted a pretty, second-hand comedy opera called <span class="italic">Dorothy</span> with medium success. When he went to close the show to allow his burlesquers to return, his accountant took it up, transferred it to the Prince of Wales, and turned it into the longest running London musical of the nineteenth century. Even George Edwardes didn't always get it right.<br>
<br>The new burlesque tradition lasted less than a decade before it transformed itself into a slightly different kind of entertainment. Fred Leslie died in 1892, Nellie Farren became disabled, and the style of show in which they had triumphed wilted. So Edwardes tried something else. He mounted a piece, at the Prince of Wales Theatre, which used all the elements of the new burlesque&#151;the cheerful, topical comedy, the bright songs and dances, the lively display, the popular performers&#151;but these, instead of being set in an incongruous fairytale story decked out in fantastical costumes, were used to decorate a straightforward wisp of an up-to-date, London tale. <span class="italic">In Town</span> (1892), with popular music-hall comedian Arthur Roberts and established singing star Florence St John billed large above the title, featured Roberts as a lad-about-town giving a young aristocrat a tour of the slightly naughty highlights of London high and lowish life in the style of a French revue. The tour included, of course, a visit to the theatre, and the show took in scenes on stage and backstage. <span class="italic">In Town</span> was a big success, and Edwardes moved on to produce another &#145;modern&#146; piece, with a glimmer more of plot, <span class="italic">The Gaiety Girl</span>. This proved even more successful, and when Edwardes produced his first &#145;musical comedy&#146; (as his &#145;new&#146; genre became known) at the Gaiety, the latest trend in musical theatre became firmly established. <span class="italic">The Shop Girl</span> (1894) turned out to be even bigger than its predecessors, and the Gaiety's and Edwardes's style was fixed. It was a style which would make the Gaiety's reputation around the world.<br>
<br>The degree of success which he had known in his first years as a producer encouraged Edwardes to expand. While new burlesque still reigned, he went into partnership with American producer Augustin Daly to build a new theatre which they might share. Daly's Theatre opened in 1893. Daly did not share for long, and soon Edwardes was filling the new house year round. <span class="italic">A Gaiety Girl</span> ran part of its initial run at the Daly, and Edwardes subsequently mounted a twenty-year series of musical plays there. Partly by accident, the musicals which evolved at Daly's were different from those played at the Gaiety. The Daly's star team was topped by two staunchly romantic vocalists (baritone hero Hayden Coffin, soprano Marie Tempest) and the shows in which they and their successors teamed with soubrette Letty Lind, and with comic Huntley Wright (<span class="italic">The Geisha</span>, <span class="italic">A Greek Slave</span>, <span class="italic">San Toy</span>, <span class="italic">A Country Girl</span>), had a much more substantial kind of score and story than the dragonfly-weight pieces at the Gaiety. Thus, while at the turn of the century the Gaiety reigned over the &#145;musical comedy&#146; theatre of its day (<span class="italic">My Girl</span>, <span class="italic">A Runaway Girl</span>, <span class="italic">The Circus Girl</span>, <span class="italic">The Messenger Boy</span>, and <span class="italic">The Toreador</span>), Daly's Theatre was the hub of all that was best and most successful in the art of the romantic musical. It was from Daly's that came the most successful and widely played English-language musical of the century: Sidney Jones and Owen Hall's worldwide hit <span class="italic">The Geisha</span> (1896).<br>
<br>Edwardes's &#145;empire&#146; underwent some changes in the earliest years of the twentieth century. First the old Gaiety Theatre on the Strand was condemned by the city's roadmakers, and closed on 4 July 1903. Edwardes built a new Gaiety Theatre at the Aldwych to which he transferred his operations without missing a beat. Then he expanded to take in the Adelphi Theatre as well, and there he produced a further run of musical plays, not quite like either of his other continuing sets, of which <span class="italic">The Quaker Girl</span> (1910) turned out the most memorable. He staged a variety of new pieces at the Gaiety and in other houses round the town, including some rather more book-based shows, first-rate musical comedies based on French plays (<span class="italic">The Spring Chicken</span>, <span class="italic">The Girl from Kay's</span>, <span class="italic">The Duchess of Dantzic</span>, <span class="italic">Kitty Grey</span>), and the less vertebrate, baby-blue shows of Paul Rubens (<span class="italic">Three Little Maids</span>, <span class="italic">Lady Madcap</span>). There was even an abortive attempt to bring back burlesque with <span class="italic">The New Aladdin</span>, but the main change in policy and style came as the result of a little palace revolution. Hayden Coffin and house designer Percy Anderson introduced a would-be writer friend to Edwardes, who allowed him to work on a text with his in-house team of show-makers, headed by James Tanner. The man proved a no-hoper and was eased out, but when the new Daly's show was mounted he claimed that his work had been stolen and he sued. Unwise words were said, and resentment and jealousy of Edwardes and his &#145;cronies&#146;, Tanner and stage director Pat Malone, and their dominant place in the musical theatre boiled over. Coffin and Anderson were dispensed with, and Edwardes soon switched to importing proven pieces from the newly resuscitated continental stage instead of having them written to order. He chose his moment well, and in the pre-1914 years he had vast successes with Messager's <span class="italic">V&eacute;ronique</span> and <span class="italic">Les p'tites Michu</span>, Leh&aacute;r's <span class="italic">Die lustige Witwe</span> (<span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span>) and <span class="italic">Der Graf von Luxemburg</span> (<span class="italic">The Count of Luxemburg</span>), Leo Fall's <span class="italic">Die Dollarprinzessin</span> (<span class="italic">The Dollar Princess</span>), Jean Gilbert's <span class="italic">Die geschiedene Frau</span> (<span class="italic">The Girl on the Train</span>), and Victor Jacobi's <span class="italic">Le&aacute;nyv&aacute;s&aacute;r</span> (<span class="italic">The Marriage Market</span>).<br>
<br>George Edwardes was still the most important figure in the British musical theatre when his final illness overtook him in 1914. He died at his home, 11 Park Square West, Regent's Park, London, on 4 October 1915, and after a requiem mass at the Jesuit church in Farm Street, he was buried in St Mary's Roman Catholic cemetery at Kensal Green on 7 October. His wife survived him. In spite of some recent reverses he was a rich man, with properties at Windsor Forest, Ogbourne in Wiltshire, and a stud farm business at Ballykisteen in co. Tipperary (he was devoted to the turf). Plans were in place for the three principal theatres under his control at the time of his death, but the structures he had set up soon collapsed without him to control them, even though his friend Bobbie Evett managed to keep Daly's afloat for some time thanks to an enormous success with <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span> (which he billed: &#145;George Edwardes presents &hellip;&#146;). The musical theatre moved on to new styles of entertainment in an era which thoroughly deserved to be called post-Edwardesian, so large had he loomed over its development and international success.<br>
