<span class="headword">Festing,  Michael Christian</span>  (1705&#150;1752), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, third son and fourth child of John Festing (<i>b</i>. 1672/3) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Casey or Casy (<i>b</i>. 1680/81), was born in London on 29 November 1705; his elder brother John, also a musician (flautist and oboist), was evidently born five years earlier. Thus the tale (retailed not only in Burke's <span class="italic">Landed Gentry</span> but in several other standard works of reference) which maintains their father to have been a certain Count Festing, German-born aide-de-camp to Prince Eugene killed in the battle of Blenheim (1704), whose boys were taken to England in 1711 or thereabouts and given a helping hand by the duke of Marlborough, is a romantic fiction evidently created during the first half of the nineteenth century. So too, it seems, is the notion that one or other of the brothers was the original of Hogarth's &#145;Enraged Musician&#146;.<br>
<br>John, the boys' true father, was most probably the Mr Festing whose name is to be found in one or two early eighteenth-century concert notices. Michael himself is said to have been a pupil of Richard Jones and later also of Geminiani. It seems likely that he also had composition lessons with Bononcini. According to Burney, Festing made his first public appearance as both violinist and composer in 1724, but as a soloist at any rate this is at least a year too late. Certainly it was not long before he had established himself as a leading figure on the London musical scene. By 1727 he was playing not only in Handel's opera orchestra at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, but also in the royal band (both of which he subsequently led), and for ten years (from its opening in 1742) he was director of music at Ranelagh Gardens. He was also much involved in subscription concerts at Hickford's Room and in the activities of several City musical clubs such as the Castle Society, the Philharmonic Society, the Academy of Vocal (later Ancient) Music, and Maurice Greene's Apollo Society. Festing is now chiefly remembered, however, for his key role in the setting up, in April 1738, of a &#145;Fund for the Support of Decay'd Musicians or their Families&#146; (later the Royal Society of Musicians), a charitable organization to which, for several years, he acted as secretary. Though Hawkins considered him &#145;inferior to many of his time&#146;  (Hawkins, 2.892) as a public performer, he thought Festing &#145;had but few equals&#146;  (ibid., 2.893) as a composer for the violin, &#145;the nature and genius whereof he perfectly understood&#146;  (ibid., 2.892&#150;3). Burney, on the other hand, could find almost nothing good to say of him, and Festing is damningly dismissed as a man who &#145;by good sense, probity, prudent conduct, and a gentleman-like behaviour, acquired a weight and influence in his profession, at which hardly any musician of his class ever arrived&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.1072). His published works, the first of which came out in 1730, were mostly sold not in the music shops but by the composer himself, and consist mainly of music for strings: three sets of concerti grossi, two of trio sonatas, and four of solos (or rather sonatas) for violin and continuo. There are also four volumes of songs and cantatas together with an ode written to celebrate the duke of Cumberland's victorious return after the battle of Culloden. The instrumental works (but not the vocal ones) all have opus numbers, and their subscriptions lists show that the composer was well supported not only by the nobility and gentry but also by professional musicians and musical societies up and down the country. At his death on 24 July 1752 Festing left a widow (Anne) and two sons, the elder of whom (Michael) was a clergyman who, two years earlier (on 28 January 1750), had married the daughter and only surviving child of his close friend Maurice Greene.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67165"></a><span class="headword">John Festing</span>  (1699/1700&#150;1774/5), <span class="occ">music teacher</span>, the elder brother, made his d&eacute;but in March 1721 and was shortly afterwards playing in the opera orchestra as an oboist. He seems to have been rather less active than Michael as a public performer. As a flute teacher, however, he was apparently much in demand, and &#145;had more scholars than any master in London&#146;  (Hawkins, 2.892). And with such as John Spencer (father of the first Earl Spencer) among them, John Festing is said to have been worth &pound;8000 when in late 1774 or early 1775 (not 1772 as Hawkins has it) he died after &#145;a lingering illness&#146;. In his will he is described as a &#145;Gentleman of Wokingham Berks.&#146;. From the fact that his estate passed directly to his grandchildren it may be assumed that his wife (Letitia) and all three children had predeceased him. The present whereabouts of a portrait allegedly by Gainsborough (and last seen in 1907) is unknown.<br>
