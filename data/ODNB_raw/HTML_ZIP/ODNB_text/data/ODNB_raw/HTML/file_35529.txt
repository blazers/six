</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pigou,  Arthur Cecil</span>  (1877&#150;1959), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 18 November 1877 at Beachlands, Ryde, Isle of Wight, the son of Clarence George Scott Pigou and his wife, Nora, second daughter of Sir John Lees. Clarence Pigou was a retired army officer of little distinction, descended from a Huguenot family which had long connections with China and India, first as traders, then as members of the Indian Civil Service. The Lees were descended from a family which acquired wealth and distinction in Irish administration. In 1891 Pigou, like his father, went to Harrow School, to which he gained an entrance scholarship and where he was head of the school (1895). At King's College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1896, he was awarded a scholarship and obtained a first class in the history tripos in 1899, followed by a first in part two of the moral sciences tripos in 1900. Hence he came to economics by way of history, philosophy, and ethics. He was a brilliant debater and became president of the Cambridge Union. When he began to teach economics he could scarcely have been regarded as a specialist in the subject; indeed he had won the chancellor's medal for English verse in 1899, the Burney prize in 1900, and had submitted as his first, unsuccessful, attempt for a fellowship at King's a thesis, &#145;Browning as a religious teacher&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Cambridgeeconomist"></a>Cambridge economist</h2>Pigou began to lecture in economics in 1901, before his election in 1902 to a fellowship at King's; he was made Girdler's lecturer in the summer of 1904. Already in 1901&#150;2 he had begun to give to second-year students the course on advanced economics that formed the basis of the education of Cambridge economists over the next thirty years. Much of his writing at this time, including <span class="italic">The Riddle of the Tariff</span> (1903), which won him some public recognition, was associated with the tariff question, on which he was a vigorous free-trade campaigner; there were also a few short technical pieces on consumer surplus, import duties, and dumping. His most ambitious publication prior to his appointment to the Cambridge chair was the rather discursive <span class="italic">Principles and Methods of Industrial Peace</span> (1905), part of which was written in collaboration with John Maynard Keynes, but it was in no way a major work. To the delight of Alfred Marshall and the chagrin of some of the older historical school Pigou was elected in 1908, at the age of thirty, to succeed Marshall as professor of political economy at Cambridge. His publications record at the time was respectable though not substantial; he was certainly appointed very much on promise rather than performance. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1927.<br>
<br>The two major influences on Pigou were Henry Sidgwick, whose lectures on ethics Pigou had attended, and Alfred Marshall. Sidgwick's influence showed itself principally in Pigou's wholehearted adoption of the utilitarian view and in his distinction between private and social cost; Sidgwick had also stressed the importance of public goods and the tendency to undervalue the future. Marshall was the supreme influence in terms of economic analysis and method but in terms of vision and of Pigou's lifelong interest in the welfare aspects of economics Sidgwick was at least as important. Throughout his life Pigou was a devoted and largely uncritical pupil of Marshall; his course of lectures became the principal channel through which the oral tradition of Marshall's economics was passed down. Pigou was uncritical in the sense that it was he, more than any other, who brought up a generation of Cambridge economists in the conviction that &#145;it's all in Marshall&#146;.<br>
<br>Pigou's character and personality have always been something of a puzzle. In the early days his tall and viking-like appearance made a great impression. He was a highly effective debater and a brilliant and systematic lecturer, who gave generations of students their training in the disciplines and techniques of economic reasoning. Hugh Dalton was among his &#145;hero-worshippers&#146;  (Dalton, 57&#150;8). To the evident irritation of Marshall, Pigou was careless of his personal appearance. Marshall complained: &#145;Fay, I do wish you'd speak to Pigou on a personal matter&#151;a rather delicate matter. I saw him coming out of Bowes' shop in a Norfolk jacket with holes in both the elbows. So bad for the Economics Tripos!&#146;  (Saltmarsh and Wilkinson, 18). Pigou loved practical jokes and young men and often affected a silly high-pitched voice. He was an enthusiastic rock-climber and led parties of undergraduates both in the Alps and in the Lake District. In both his life and his work he adopted a tone of high moral seriousness. As a consistent pacifist he volunteered to drive for the Friends' Ambulance Unit at the front during the First World War and insisted on taking on the more dangerous jobs. However, the shocks of war had a profound effect upon him: from 1927 onwards he suffered from a debilitating heart disease and he was increasingly regarded as an eccentric and a recluse. Those who went up to Cambridge in the late 1950s remembered him as an eccentrically clad, unapproachable figure reading &#145;shockers&#146; on a deck chair on the grass at King's. He had never been interested in administration or in sitting on committees (though he reluctantly served on the Cunliffe committee of 1918&#150;19 and the Chamberlain committee of 1924&#150;5) and had never attended an economics conference. In later years he withdrew altogether from national affairs and devoted himself almost completely to academic economics. This picture of personal isolation may be misleading, however: although he never married, his correspondence with his publishers, Macmillan, suggests a small circle of close friends, both male and female.<h2>
<a name="Theeconomicsofwelfare"></a>The economics of welfare</h2>Pigou's ultimate standing as an economist must depend on the ideas put forward in his major work, <span class="italic">The Economics of Welfare</span> (1920), which was based on his earlier book of 1912, <span class="italic">Wealth and Welfare</span>. This book went through many editions and virtually created the subject of welfare economics. At its centre was the Marshallian concept of the national dividend, or national income, a concept which Pigou did much to polish and refine. Pigou offered a coherent and practical double criterion for an improvement in economic welfare: first, economic welfare would increase if the national dividend increased while the poor did not become worse off; second, economic welfare would increase if the poor became better off while the national dividend did not decrease. Behind his scheme lay the notion that the satisfactions of different people could be compared with one another. Satisfactions were not in principle incomparable even if they were not directly measurable; there was a sufficient body of evidence that people were on average alike in many characteristics and that, for large groups of people, it was not unreasonable to treat them as such. While this view became unfashionable after the 1940s and necessitated a defence when Pigou was in his seventy-fourth year, inter-personal comparisons were later widely used in welfare analysis. Pigou was arguing, however, for a very limited form of income redistribution which would unambiguously improve welfare only if it did not reduce the national dividend. Cases where it might reduce the dividend&#151;minimum wage legislation, for example&#151;required careful evaluation.<br>
<br>On the whole Pigou expected competition to maximize the national dividend since it tended to make marginal products equal in all lines of activity. However, following Sidgwick's lead, he distinguished carefully between marginal private and marginal social net products. The differences between them came to be known as externalities. The abatement of smoke from factory chimneys improves air quality and is an example of marginal social product exceeding marginal private product; there is a positive externality. The employment of pregnant women in heavy industrial work has adverse effects on the health of the woman and her baby and is an example of marginal private product exceeding marginal social product; there is a negative externality. The general import of Pigou's discussion (though heavily qualified) was that negative externalities should be taxed so as to discourage them, and positive externalities subsidized so as to encourage them. Until very recently Pigouvian taxes have been little used and were much criticized in principle by Coase and the Chicago school from 1950 on the ground that, in the presence of well-defined property rights, they are not only unnecessary but make matters worse. This line of criticism ignores Pigou's own statement which made it clear that he was considering cases where such well-defined rights did not apply. Though in general Pigou favoured the free market system the emphasis he put on externalities ensured that a major difficulty with the optimality properties of competition had to be taken account of by mainstream economists.<br>
<br>Following Marshall and Sidgwick, Pigou famously stressed people's undervaluation of the future, which he described as a &#145;defective telescopic faculty&#146;. He saw discounting of the future as irrational, as something that could in time be educated out of people. This line of argument was pushed even further by his brilliant young colleague at King's, Frank Ramsey, who held that time discounting was actually immoral. Pigou believed that people also undervalued the future because the benefits of longer-term investment would tend to go to those &#145;remote in blood or time&#146;; unlike good utilitarians they valued the utilities of other people at less than their own. As in the case of externalities this argument created another hole in the optimality of competition since saving, and therefore investment, would be too little. As was so often the case with Pigou he was reluctant to press the obvious policy conclusion of a bounty on saving in the form of tax relief since it would tend to favour the better off  (A. C. Pigou, <span class="italic">Study in Public Finance</span>, 1928).<br>
<br>In view of the genetic engineering debate at the end of the twentieth century Pigou's participation in the eugenics debate at the beginning of the century is of interest. Both Marshall and Pigou were keen advocates of building up human capital, particularly the human capital of the poor. Pigou saw, however, that if human welfare were to depend mainly on &#145;germ-cells&#146; there would be only a limited role for economics. In a striking phrase&#151;&#145;environments too have children&#146;&#151;he emphasized the importance of the physical and human capital that each generation passed to the next. Economics would continue to be important!<h2>
<a name="BusinesscyclesunemploymentandthedebatewithKeynes"></a>Business cycles, unemployment, and the debate with Keynes</h2>Pigou's contribution to the analysis of business cycles has been undervalued until quite recently. Pigou was one of a number of distinguished pre-Keynesian writers on the cycle, who included Ralph Hawtrey and Dennis Holme Robertson. His <span class="italic">Industrial Fluctuations</span> (1927) was a magisterial account of a comprehensive yet eclectic approach which went out of fashion following Keynes but is similar in spirit to much of the late twentieth-century work stimulated by real business cycle theory. Pigou considered, but rejected, the notion of an equilibrium business cycle. Fluctuations, he argued, are driven by variations in the profit expectations of business people; these, in turn, are set off by impulses which may be real, psychological, or monetary in nature. Once the initiating impulse has made itself felt it may be sustained by any or all of the three. Consequent fluctuations in employment will be greater the greater the degree of price or wage rigidity and, because of externalities, are probably larger than is socially desirable. Typically Pigou was not willing to explain such a complex phenomenon as the cycle by means of a single, simple theory. His emphasis on the welfare aspects of fluctuations was consistent with his original inclusion, in <span class="italic">Wealth and Welfare</span> (1912), of reductions in variations in the national dividend as a criterion for improvement. His theory of the cycle had already been sketched out in that work and his analysis of unemployment was outlined for non-specialists in <span class="italic">Unemployment</span> (1913).<br>
<br>To the new generation of economists graduating in the 1930s Pigou's work, particularly his <span class="italic">Theory of Unemployment</span> (1933), became best known as a stalking-horse for Keynes's <span class="italic">General Theory</span>. Keynes's excuse for his sometimes sharp and merciless attack on Pigou was that &#145;Pigou's <span class="italic">Theory of Unemployment</span> seems to me to get out of the Classical Theory all that can be got out of it&#146;  (Johnson, 151). Their two books certainly took quite different views of the problem. Both accepted that a slump implied a reduction in the real demand for labour. For Pigou the elasticity of the real demand for labour was crucial to the consequent level of unemployment and much of his book was devoted to measuring it. For Keynes unemployment was due to a lack of aggregate demand. Pigou's book, though generally well received, was strongly attacked by the rising Keynesians. Pigou was similarly scathing about Keynes's <span class="italic">General Theory</span> in a review he wrote for <span class="italic">Economica</span> (new ser., 3, 1936): &#145;Einstein actually did for Physics what Mr. Keynes believes himself to have done for Economics &hellip; but he did not insinuate &hellip; that Newton and those who had hitherto followed his lead were a gang of incompetent bunglers&#146;  (p. 121). Keynes and Richard Kahn so strongly believed that Pigou was mistaken that they tried to block the publication of an article by him in 1937, in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, of which Keynes was editor. It is clear that Pigou had grossly misjudged the revolutionary impact that the <span class="italic">General Theory</span> was to make. But in terms of technical economic analysis he had several important points to make concerning, for example, Keynes's cavalier analysis of expectations, his omission of interest rates from the consumption function, and his assumption of nominal wage rigidity.<br>
<br>The Keynes&#150;Pigou debate points to a misunderstanding about the nature and originality of Pigou's economics. Because he liked to absorb everything into the gigantic sponge of <span class="italic">The Economics of Welfare</span> his original contributions tend to be masked. Yet they were original and important. &#145;The classical stationary state&#146;  (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 53, 1943, 343&#150;51) introduced the &#145;Pigou-effect&#146; into the literature, and Pigou's awareness of the technical importance of the multiplier became clear in his <span class="italic">Employment and Equilibrium</span> (1941), which was a major exercise in comparative statics and developed a whole family of multipliers. In the same book Pigou argued that Keynes's system was simply the classical system together with the assumption of a rigid money wage, thus laying the foundations for the later neo-classical synthesis. These were contributions of the first order by any standard. Pigou's considered statement in his <span class="italic">Retrospective View</span> of 1950 was by no means the recantation that Keynesians have taken it to be.<br>
<br>At the onset of the Second World War Pigou, despite his age and poor health, wished to make some contribution and offered his services in 1940, first (via Keynes) to the government and then to the teaching of &#145;Hun, Frog and Wop&#146; at Eton College: from what he called his &#145;funk-hole&#146; at Buttermere in Cumberland he complained that he couldn't just sit there eating the nation's food without any proofs to correct. He also wrote <span class="italic">Aspects of British Economic History</span> at this time, which, to his chagrin, the authorities insisted on treating as an official secret so it was not published until 1947. In his old age he revived a facility for the short, popular exposition of abstruse matters. The little book <span class="italic">Socialism versus Capitalism</span> (1937) had been a good example of this skill; <span class="italic">Income</span> (1946) was outstandingly successful. Other short books from the period include <span class="italic">Lapses from Full Employment</span> (1945), <span class="italic">The Veil of Money</span> (1949), and the aforementioned <span class="italic">Retrospective View</span> (1950). The lightness of these miniatures comes as a relief from some of the earlier pudding-like tomes and they provide a graceful end to a long and distinguished career.<br>
<br>Pigou retired from his Cambridge chair in 1943 but continued to live at King's College until his death at Cambridge Hospital, on 7 March 1959.<br>
