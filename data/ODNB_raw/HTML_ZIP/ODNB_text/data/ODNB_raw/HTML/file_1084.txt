<span class="headword">Bainbrigg,  Reginald</span>  (1544/5&#150;1612/13), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and antiquary</span>, born at Hilton, near Appleby, Westmorland, was probably a younger son of Christopher Bainbrigg (<i>c</i>.1505&#150;1569), a member of a minor gentry family which had been at Hilton from the fifteenth century. Reginald Bainbrigg matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, in 1572, and graduated BA in 1576 and MA in 1579.<br>
<br>In 1580 Bainbrigg was appointed headmaster of the grammar school at Appleby, founded by Robert Langton (<i>c</i>.1460&#150;1524), his grandfather's cousin, and reconstituted by royal charter in 1574. There he combined his school work with antiquarian and archaeological research. He was one of the first to record the remains along Hadrian's Wall and has been described as &#145;the ablest of all the northern antiquaries&#146; of his generation  (Birley, 7). With considerable care and skill Bainbrigg recorded stones bearing ancient inscriptions from Cumberland, Westmorland, and neighbouring parts of Northumberland. He made two journeys, in 1599 and 1601, along Hadrian's Wall and into Tynedale and Redesdale, his notes being the earliest known record, and a key source, for several of the sites he visited. His antiquarian interests brought him into contact with William Camden and other contemporary scholars, such as John Denton of Cardew, who wrote the first historical account of Cumberland. Bainbrigg sent Camden copies of the inscriptions, which Camden printed in the 1607 edition of <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, acknowledging his indebtedness to him, but altering some of his readings in a cavalier fashion. Bainbrigg took some original Roman inscriptions back to Appleby, made copies of others, and added several <i>jeux d'esprit</i> of his own. In 1602 he built a small house in his garden for their preservation, carving an inscription stating that he had been teaching at Appleby for twenty-two years and was fifty-seven years old. In 1722 twelve Roman stones remained at the school, but by 1911 only four Roman inscriptions survived, along with others of Bainbrigg's own devising.<br>
<br>Bainbrigg was a major benefactor to his school at Appleby. The existing school house proving too small, he purchased land nearby, on which he began to build. By his will, traditionally but perhaps erroneously dated 1606, he bequeathed almost all his possessions, including the building materials he had gathered, to his successors as masters of the grammar school, and a new school was completed after his death. Bainbrigg's personal library, which he also left to the school, was deposited in the library of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1966. Of 295 volumes, 158 survive, providing a rare insight into the interests of an Elizabethan schoolmaster. In Appleby, Bainbrigg's reputation remained vivid in the later seventeenth century. He was remembered as a &#145;learn'd ingenious person&#146;, who was &#145;look'd upon as a Conjuror&#146; who had cast spells to prevent the deciphering of the inscriptions in his collection  (Machel MS, vol. 6, 189, 195&#150;6). In his will Reginald Bainbrigg asked to be buried with his parents and siblings in St Michael's Church, Appleby. The absence of a record of his burial there suggests that his death, between April 1612 and September 1613, took place elsewhere.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_1083"></a><span class="headword">Reginald Bainbrigg</span>  (<em>c.</em>1489&#150;1554)<span class="occ"></span>, probably an uncle or cousin of the schoolmaster and antiquary, was born at Middleton, Westmorland, the son of John Bainbrigg (<i>c</i>.1464&#150;1542) and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1551), his wife. He took the degree of BA at Cambridge in 1506, of MA in 1509, and of BTh in 1526. He was proctor of the university in 1517, a fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, and master from 1529 to 1547. He held a succession of livings in Essex, being instituted to the rectory of Downham on 27 June 1525 and to that of Stambourne on 1 December 1526. He was made vicar of Bricklesea on 19 May 1530, of Steeple Bumpstead on 13 May 1532 (where he was living in 1554), and of Great Oakley on 11 January 1538. In 1537 he was appointed to a prebend stall at Wells. He appears to have died in November 1554. A third Reginald Bainbrigg (<i>d</i>. 1606), who matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1573, graduated BA in 1576&#150;7, and was vicar of Steeple Bumpstead from 1582 to 1606, may have been a member of the same family.<br>
