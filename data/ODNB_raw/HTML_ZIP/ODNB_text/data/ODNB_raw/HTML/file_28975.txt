<span class="headword">Weir,  William</span>  (1802&#150;1858), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 9 February 1802 at Mount Hamilton, St Quivox parish, Ayrshire, the only child of Oswald Weir, factor to the Oswalds of Auchencruive, pre-eminent local landowners, and of May Denholm (<i>b</i>. 1775) of Holywell, Dumfriesshire. He was orphaned by the age of thirteen, and the Oswalds became his guardians. After leaving Ayr Academy in 1817 with the reputation of being &#145;talented, honourable, kind-hearted, somewhat eccentric, and a most rapacious reader&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) Weir studied arts and law at the universities of St Andrews (1817&#150;20), Edinburgh (1820&#150;22; 1825&#150;6), and G&ouml;ttingen (1824&#150;5). Although admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh on 31 January 1827, he soon plunged into literary work and journalism. Reminiscences of student life in Germany provided material in 1829&#150;30 for serialized articles in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Literary Journal</span>. This introduced him into the publishing stable of the radical bookseller William Tait, whose <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>, launched appropriately in 1832, accepted articles by Weir promoting liberalism at home and abroad.<br>
<br>Political credentials established, Weir was engaged in February 1833 as editor of the <span class="italic">Glasgow Argus</span>, a new organ published by Glasgow's dominant whig clique. During six years Weir brought journalistic flair and rising circulation figures, but also propagated a radical gospel of further constitutional change (including the ballot and suffrage extension), religious dissent, national education, and, above all, total repeal of the corn laws.<br>
<br>Weir's energies were not monopolized: he married Ellen Reid, daughter of John Reid, advocate, on 18 December 1837, lectured at Glasgow Mechanics' Institute, and in the same decade engaged to duel, with the proprietor of the tory <span class="italic">Glasgow Chronicle</span>, John Douglas of Barloch, but was fortunately interrupted. More significantly, from 1833 he laid the Scottish foundations of the anti-cornlaw agitation, which combined with Cobden and Manchester free-traders to create the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script> in 1838&#150;9. Initially Weir was one of its foremost strategists. However, his advocacy in 1839, through the <span class="italic">Argus</span>, of schismatic tactics by radicals against whigs in support of an uncompromising free trade programme provoked dismissal by his exasperated whig employers.<br>
<br>Weir fulfilled a long-standing ambition by moving to London. He was admitted as a barrister to the Middle Temple on 4 March 1840, but literary and journalistic commissions soon took precedence. Through Charles Knight, he contributed in 1841&#150;4 to Knight's <span class="italic">London</span> and <span class="italic">The Pictorial History of England during the Reign of George the Third</span>. Contemporaneously, the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge employed him on the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span> and the <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span>. He also wrote for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and was employed for one year in 1841 to edit the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span>. Biographical and geographical assignments suited his wide education, encyclopaedic interests, and magpie approach.<br>
<br>Weir re-entered full-time political journalism appropriately on the eve of corn law repeal in 1846, when he was recruited by Charles Dickens to be railway and colonial editor on the launching of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. In 1854 he became one of Dickens's successors as general editor of the paper. He had &#145;at last obtained a position in which [he hoped] to be of some use&#146;, but felt that had he attained it when he was &#145;a little younger and stronger&#146;, he &#145;would have spoken with more confidence&#146;  (W. Weir to Lord Brougham, 1856, Brougham MS 29,792). His tenure coincided nevertheless with several major developments abroad, including the Crimean War, the Indian mutiny, and crises in Europe. Weir's endorsement of liberal causes in Italy and Hungary, and of the dissenting cause of national education at home marked his period as editor. He was equally lauded, however, by political friend and foe alike for the high moral tone, professional standards, and gentlemanly conduct which he brought to the journal.<br>
<br>Although suffering indifferent health for years, Weir died as the result of an accident that precipitated a strangulated hernia, on 15 September 1858, at his home, 4 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London. He was buried on 21 September at Kensal Green cemetery. Weir's career as a whole reflected the attraction of journalism as a source of political influence through the expanding Victorian fourth estate.<br>
