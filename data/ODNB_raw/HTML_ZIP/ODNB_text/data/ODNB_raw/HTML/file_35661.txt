</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ramsay, Sir  Bertram Home</span>  (1883&#150;1945), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Hampton Court Palace on 20 January 1883, the third son of Captain William Alexander Ramsay and his wife, Susan, daughter of William Minchiner, of Clontarf, co. Dublin. He was born into an old established but long removed family from the highlands of Scotland, the Ramsays of Balmain. The Ramsays were also a service family and young Bertie lived the life of an officer's son, at one stage coming into contact with a young subaltern named Winston Churchill when the latter served under his father's command. Ramsay spent some time at Colchester grammar school, where he was remembered as a quiet but intense boy with, despite his relatively small stature, a natural talent for sports&#151;riding, shooting, and running. Ramsay's older brothers followed the long family tradition by entering the army, but he followed a different path. It had become something of a tradition for youngest sons of larger families with some social position to enter the navy. An important reason for this was that the fees the navy charged for entry through the cadet ship <i>Britannia</i> were far lower than those demanded by the public schools. Two years after his parents were posted to India Ramsay entered the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in January 1898.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Ramsay passed out in May 1899 and received his commission in September. A fairly typical career for a junior officer then ensued, marked by a taste of active service in the Somaliland expedition of 1903&#150;4. There Ramsay earned a mention in dispatches for his work in a sphere where he was destined to make his mark: combined operations with the army. This brought him promotion to lieutenant and varied appointments over the next five years, including service in the first commission of the <i>Dreadnought</i>. The first promise of potential for great things came indirectly from Ramsay's decision to specialize as a signals officer, with a posting to the Royal Naval Signal School in Portsmouth for two years in 1909. One reason for this decision was an urge to defy the convention that gunnery was the road to flag rank; he cited a dislike of getting dirty hands as another! But the main reason was that Ramsay was more interested in moving fleets than ships, in grappling with bigger and broader naval problems. Signals training and sea duty brought him into contact with those parts of the navy dealing directly with new technology and the impact it would have on naval warfare.<br>
<br>The creation of a naval war staff in 1912 at last gave the service an arm devoted solely to preparing officers to identify, study, and cope with all manner of challenges the navy might face. It also began to promote modern methods of organization and command, reducing the emphasis on one commander running a fleet by himself in favour of sharing that load with a staff trained to manage and administer a large organization. This was a long difficult process destined to absorb the energies of a generation of naval officers. There was much resistance to the idea that the navy's acquired wisdom and time-honoured methods might no longer be enough to fight and win wars. But from the start it was clear where Ramsay stood.<br>
<br>Selected in 1913 for the second cohort of students at the Royal Naval War College, then at Portsmouth, Ramsay found the navy he was looking for. In some ways he personified its evolving blend, even as a junior officer just thirty years old. He was a stickler for observing customs and traditions which he felt contributed directly to efficiency and combat readiness: running a clean and well-organized ship, being well turned out in dress and deportment, looking aggressively to confront any challenges. But Ramsay's instincts and preferences led him to welcome the new emphasis on formal training, rather than reliance on the martial instincts of a supposedly superior social class to meet the challenge of war. He chafed at any method or procedure that was being followed only because it always had been. Passing out as a &#145;war staff officer&#146; in spring 1914, promoted to the new rank of lieutenant-commander, Ramsay returned to the <i>Dreadnought</i> as one of the new breed of naval officers determined to bring modern methods to bear in order to wean the Royal Navy away from now outmoded practices. The challenge came very soon with the outbreak in August of the First World War, met by Ramsay on his war station at sea with the Grand Fleet.<br>
<br>Ramsay had mixed luck in his wartime service. Early in 1915 he turned down an offer to become flag lieutenant to commander cruisers, Grand Fleet, in the cruiser <i>Defence</i>, hoping to get his own command. After a short spell at the signal section of the Admiralty, he received his wish with the small monitor <i>M.25</i> of the Dover patrol. <i>Defence</i> was blown up at Jutland. Ramsay had two collisions while serving in the Dover patrol, one of which earned him a reprimand from his commander, Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes, when Ramsay put Keyes's back up by bluntly rejecting any blame for the incident. But he lived through active and enterprising service which brought him command of the destroyer <i>Broke</i>, much experience of operations in the channel in collaboration with ground and air forces, and another mention in dispatches. At the war's end Ramsay was given the honour of transporting George V to France for a visit to the troops and made MVO for his own services.<br>
<br>In 1919 Lord Jellicoe selected Ramsay to be flag commander on his staff for an important tour of the dominions, to consider measures for future imperial defence. This exposure to the circles of power launched Ramsay on a post-war career path which, in the words of his biographer, &#145;might have been specially designed to fit him for the highest posts in the Navy&#146;  (Chalmers, 40). After two successive ship commands in the Mediterranean Ramsay was promoted captain in June 1923. This was followed by success in the senior officers' war and tactical courses, command of the cruiser <i>Danae</i>, then a spell as instructor at the War College. In 1929 Ramsay took command of the cruiser <i>Kent</i> as flag captain on the China station. He went from there to the Imperial Defence College in London in July 1931 to serve as the naval instructor on the staff; while there he struck up a lasting friendship with Alan Brooke which both later counted on in desperate times. In November 1933 Ramsay took command of the battleship <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, and in May 1935 he was promoted to flag rank.<br>
<br>Ramsay reached that exalted status after twenty-nine years of sea service and four staff postings, having had to endure only two shore billets despite his signals speciality. In large part this can be attributed to his early commitment to the war staff course and his strong support for the modernizing trends in the navy. With this blend of sea and staff experience he developed a broadness of vision on policy and strategy which reinforced his stature as a successful commander. Still only fifty-two, he had good reason to feel that the highest posts in the service were not out of reach.<h2>
<a name="Organizerparexcellence"></a>Organizer par excellence</h2>Ramsay's character has been well described as &#145;a mass of well-controlled contradictions&#146;  (Stephen, 58). He loved the service and devoted himself to it, but also loved the life of a middle-class professional. Adding a passion for polo and the countryside to his earlier sporting pursuits, Ramsay worked hard to live up to his ideal image of the squire&#150;sailor. When in London he dined in the right restaurants and clubs, patronized the theatre, and liked to mention being in the same places with famous and powerful people. But this was not empty socializing. Ramsay was ambitious&#151;a meticulous organizer and systematic planner who never let himself drift along to no point or purpose. This is demonstrated by the story of his marriage. Reflecting contentedly on how well he was doing, he noted in his diary in 1925 that now all he needed was &#145;a charming wife and two good lieutenants&#146;. An early romance in Australia on the Jellicoe tour had been cruelly cut short when the young woman died in the great influenza epidemic that swept the world in 1919. Home leave in 1925 led to an introduction to Helen Margaret, daughter of Colonel Charles T. Menzies. The Menzies came from the same border region of Scotland where Ramsay's own father had been raised. Helen was half his age, but shared his passion for life, horses, the countryside, and success. It took four years of determined courtship to win a proud and independent woman fully his equal in intelligence and ambition. They married in February 1929, by now devoted to each other. Two sons soon followed and Ramsay found in a happy and stable family an anchor in his life.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly, Ramsay was something of an authoritarian, typical for his time and social and professional milieu. Politically his views were certainly conservative but not unconventional. Professionally, he was seen to be a stickler, always commanding the respect but not always winning the affection of his subordinates. Ramsay was very intelligent indeed, with great confidence in his own ability. This sometimes led him to be brash and he was impatient with anything that seemed outmoded or inefficient. He was regarded as fair, but also often as difficult by both superiors and subordinates. Ramsay had immense powers of concentration, was a superb organizer, and was always able to master the detail without losing sight of the big picture. Living up to his own creed he was always willing to delegate and to listen to the ideas of others. The picture that emerges as he reaches flag rank is that of a well-rounded individual who lived life with zest, but was so determined to improve his service that he could be awkward when faced with something he felt hindered it. This trait very nearly ended his career.<br>
<br>Soon after reaching flag rank in 1935 Ramsay was invited by the incoming commander-in-chief, Home Fleet, Sir Roger Backhouse, to join him as his chief of staff. It was a prize posting and Backhouse was an old friend, their acquaintance stretching back nearly thirty years to when they were shipmates in the <i>Dreadnought</i>. Ramsay could not resist the opportunity, but took up his posting with well-founded apprehension. The problem was professional. He was a modernist who strongly believed the navy had to be run by delegation and decentralization; Backhouse was of the old school, equally convinced of the traditional, centralized method of command and determined to practise it. As Backhouse was also a workaholic with strong views on all matters great and small, and just as much pride and self-confidence as Ramsay, a clash was unavoidable. Ramsay joined his staff in August 1935. Within a few weeks, they were at loggerheads. Backhouse tried to do everything by himself, which left Ramsay frustrated and unimpressed by what he thought was outmoded practice. His attempts to act as a more responsible chief of staff were seen by Backhouse as efforts to run the fleet for him. In December Ramsay asked to be relieved and soon found himself idle and on half pay.<br>
<br>Their colleagues in the navy held both Backhouse and Ramsay responsible for this lamentable result&#151;Backhouse because he clung to outmoded command methods, Ramsay because he quit in frustration rather than try to change the system one step at a time. To the credit of both men their friendship survived this failure, and Backhouse strongly endorsed Ramsay's fitness for future employment. But Ramsay rejected a command on the China station, one suspects out of lingering resentment that the Admiralty did not support his views against Backhouse. When he reached the top of the rear-admirals' list in October 1938 without having hoisted his flag at sea, the navy placed him on the retired list. Ramsay had in the end to go through almost four years of nearly total retirement and in the navy his career was generally considered over. This hurt him more than he allowed anyone but his family to realize, as was suggested by a lengthy paper he wrote to explain to them why he had resigned. But in the long run it turned out for the best.<br>
<br>Enforced idleness brought Ramsay closer to his wife and sons. They bought a property named Bughtrig in Berwickshire, and settled down to a happy life in the country. In the process there is no doubt that some of the rougher traits of his character faded considerably. In particular Ramsay seemed to become more patient with others, more aware of the need to get along with those he worked with and function effectively as a team player. In short it seems that in retirement Ramsay found the maturity which could make his great skill so much more effective. He also gained years of rest that would prove priceless in the coming trials. Those trials loomed even before he was officially retired, when the Munich crisis brought the country to the brink of war in September 1938. The Dover command was to be reactivated if war came but it had been dormant so long that a full investigation of what steps were to be taken was required. Backhouse, now first sea lord, nominated Ramsay to make the investigation, and to stand ready as potential flag officer, Dover. Ramsay's investigation revealed many deficiencies that needed to be made good and much progress was made in that direction before war finally did come in September 1939. He was the logical choice for an appointment which he took up, still officially retired, on 24 August&#151;and in December he persuaded the Admiralty to make Dover an independent command, himself becoming vice-admiral, Dover.<h2>
<a name="ThemiracleofDunkirk"></a>The miracle of Dunkirk</h2>When the Germans attacked France and the Low Countries in May 1940 Dover immediately became a scene of much activity; when their breakthrough cut off the British expeditionary force, Ramsay was ordered to undertake the largest seaborne evacuation ever attempted. The stakes were the highest&#151;without its trained soldiers the UK would be at the mercy of an invader. Ramsay had already anticipated the need and set to work with a will on 26 May. Over the next nine days he was directly responsible for the operation which successfully evacuated 338,266 allied soldiers&#151;the &#145;miracle of Dunkirk&#146;. His Dover command went from a small headquarters to the one with the largest staff of any flag officer ashore or afloat. As the man on the spot Ramsay commanded over 900 vessels of literally all types and sizes, from the fabled small boats to fleet destroyers. Luck played a part in his success. The weather co-operated, the German advance was for a time halted, the rearguards fought stubbornly. But equally important was Ramsay's own ability to rise to the challenge and inspire his team to do the same.<br>
<br>With no prior plans or preparations Ramsay and his staff had to improvise from the start, and then adjust to frequent changes in the situation and in policy. The original hope was to evacuate 45,000 troops in two days. Under Ramsay's command those targets were left behind. Indeed, this crisis showed just what Ramsay was made of. He selected the right people to handle the right jobs and left them to get on with it. He made bold decisions, such as using destroyers to lift troops directly off the harbour mole, which made the really big numbers possible. He was meticulous but flexible, organized but not rigid, drove his ships and men hard but knew when each had had enough. The heroism of many made the evacuation work, but the skill of Ramsay and his staff gave them the chance. Ramsay, seen as an orthodox admiral, brought off one of the navy's most unorthodox feats, earning the nation a fighting chance to survive and himself a well deserved KCB from George VI.<br>
<br>For the next two years Ramsay was occupied by the struggle to ward off German invasion and to dominate the channel, working closely again with the army and the air force. The mine barrier, coastal flotilla, coastal batteries and the air force made the channel a dangerous place for enemy submarines and surface vessels&#151;and there was no invasion. On the other hand, Ramsay and the air force did fail to stop the &#145;channel dash&#146;, the embarrassing daylight run by German capital ships moving from danger in Brest to Germany in February 1942. Ramsay and nearly everyone else expected the enemy to run through the narrow Strait of Dover at night whereas they left Brest under cover of darkness and ran through at midday. This caught the available British forces off balance, but in any case those forces, naval and air, were woefully weak and not co-ordinated well enough to meet the challenge. None of this was Ramsay's fault, and he did not suffer from this one setback as a station commander. Indeed, very soon thereafter he took up the task that turned out to be his rendezvous with destiny&#151;planning and preparing for the combined operations with the army and air force that would carry the war back to the enemy, culminating in the invasion of Europe.<br>
<br>Ramsay's experience in combined operations and his triumph at Dunkirk led to his appointment as flag officer, expeditionary force, in May 1942. As such he began to plan the invasion of Europe, working with the other services and with General Eisenhower, just arrived as commanding general, US army, in the European theatre of operations. Thus began a partnership and a mission that consumed almost all the rest of Ramsay's career. When allied grand strategy shifted the focus to an invasion of French north Africa in late 1942, Ramsay's task shifted accordingly. As a planner, Ramsay brought to bear his rare ability to master the detail but not lose the broad vision. This was invaluable in planning complicated amphibious invasions, which involved problems of movement, co-ordination, operations, and supply among three different services with different priorities, methods, and tasks. Equally necessary was the ability to issue clear instructions but delegate to others the job of executing them, and perhaps most important was the need to weld a team built from different services and different nations. Ramsay demonstrated all these qualities in abundance. He still fought his corner and drove his team hard, but now related much better to those with and for whom he worked. When it was decided that to reassure the Americans a more experienced and better known fleet commander must take charge, Ramsay was obliged to give way to Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham and become his stay-behind deputy, remaining in London. His work there and the success of the invasion and subsequent advance in north Africa redounded to Ramsay's credit, and he landed the job of eastern task force commander when it was decided in early 1943 to pursue the Mediterranean campaign by invading Sicily.<br>
<br>Ramsay's job was to plan and conduct the British portion of the invasion. In the process Ramsay scored one of the more remarkable naval triumphs of the war by winning both the friendship and the confidence of his army colleague, the notoriously difficult General Sir Bernard Montgomery. One of the very few commanders from any service able to work smoothly with the charismatic Monty, Ramsay achieved this by defending the navy's interests while being ready to meet the army's legitimate needs&#151;plus a healthy dose of patience and diplomacy! He was in fact a master of combined operations, lauded by Montgomery as the only sailor who truly grasped the essential fact: the invasion was only the beginning, not the end, of the combined mission. This praise was well earned. Ramsay revelled in leading his fleet to sea in July 1943 and executing the invasion of Sicily, but the armies were barely ashore when such success brought him the ultimate challenge.<h2>
<a name="Mastermindinginvasion"></a>Masterminding invasion</h2>Ramsay returned to London that same month to rejoin the team preparing for the invasion of Europe. He gave an assessment of the problem of combined operations, written as a lecture, that was so masterful he was forbidden on security grounds to deliver it. In that text, Ramsay spelt out his concept:<blockquote>it must always be remembered that the guiding rule must be the operational plan first, and the administrative plan later, rather than the other way round. Once the Army have decided how they wish to fight the land battle it is necessary to examine how the troops can best be put ashore to give effect to the Army plan. In general it is the responsibility of the Navy to land the Army as they require, but as the plan develops Naval considerations will arise which must be discussed and agreed upon. (Ramsay MSS, file 8/22, CAC Cam.)</blockquote>This spelt out the very essence of the problem now facing the allies: while effecting a landing against fierce German resistance was certainly going to be the most daunting amphibious invasion ever attempted, that would only begin the real struggle. From there the ground forces must be built up fast enough to repel a counter-attack, then made strong enough to drive back and finish off the German army in a continental campaign. The navy's role would merely change, not end, as the advance progressed. Ramsay was for many reasons the ideal choice for the appointment he received on 25 October 1943, allied naval commander, expeditionary force (ANCXF), followed the next day by promotion to the rank of acting admiral. His experience, character, and mastery of this most difficult operation of war had won him the confidence of his own boss, the army, the Americans, and above all the prime minister. Ramsay became the first service commander to start work on invasion preparations, taking responsibility for the assault plan codenamed Neptune.<br>
<br>Ramsay was joined in January 1944 by the rest of the command team that developed operation Overlord, finding himself working once again under Eisenhower as supreme commander and alongside Montgomery, who took command of the twenty-first army group. If ever there was a right man in the right place at the right time, Ramsay was that man now. The task confronting the allies was to overcome the strongest coastal defences ever built, then mount a successful continental campaign. They had to master not just the defences but also the elements, their own differences between services, allies, and personalities, and debates over deployment of forces that dragged on long enough to make planning a nightmare. The naval commander had to draft the most complex assault plan ever conceived, marshal the largest armada ever assembled, work out sensible compromises with touchy peers and pull the whole gigantic task together in five months. Ramsay was certainly the only admiral in the Royal Navy who could have brought this off. Despite the enormous strain of the work, Ramsay inspired and directed an allied planning team which produced the most sophisticated staff work and operations plan in naval history. Ramsay kept Montgomery from sundering allied harmony, stood firm and won from Cunningham an allocation of forces the first sea lord considered excessive, demanded and received enough help from the US Navy to make the whole assault feasible, and submitted a plan that covered every contingency, including a full-scale action against the remainder of the German fleet. It assigned every vessel in the armada of over 3000 craft of all sizes specific orders on what to do and when to do it.<br>
<br>Ramsay's work earned him just rewards. In March 1944 Prime Minister Churchill compelled the Admiralty to reinstate Ramsay to the active list as a full admiral. It complied in lukewarm fashion, stating only that it was necessary to regularize his status as an allied commander in the forthcoming campaign. Did his 1935 complaints still rankle? If so, Ramsay won complete vindication in every respect with the success of the D-day invasion launched on 6 June. Four years after rescuing the army from the Germans, Ramsay sent it back to seek retribution. The success of the invasion, and the subsequent vital race to build the ground forces up so that they could consolidate that success, was compelling proof that Ramsay had been right: the modern navy needed more than fighting instructions and Nelsonian leadership. Ramsay's ability to help pull together an allied combined operation of vast complexity, sort out the essentials, and apply the plan effectively proved to be of far greater value to the nation, let alone the service, than relying on natural sailors preparing to fight another Jutland and win the war single-handedly.<br>
<br>As the campaign in north-west Europe progressed, Ramsay continued to play a vital role. When the allied armies advanced towards Germany in late August, he concentrated on keeping the supply lines flowing. Unlike Eisenhower and Montgomery, Ramsay kept his head in the euphoric days of early September and saw the greatest threat: if the enemy managed to block the channel to the massive port of Antwerp long enough, the allied armies would outrun their supply lines and grind to a halt. Unfortunately Ramsay's best efforts did not prevent the ground commanders from gambling that a quick strike could finish the enemy off. When it fell short, the naval forces were obliged to help clear the now heavily defended approaches to Antwerp along the River Scheldt, a job not completed until the end of November. This was the worst blunder Eisenhower's command team made in the campaign in north-west Europe; on that team, Ramsay stood out as the one senior commander who saw the danger and tried to head it off.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Neither this nor any other strains of such great responsibility impaired Ramsay's working relationships with his superiors, peers, and subordinates. All rightly regarded him as a tower of strength in the allied command. Privately, he felt the strain, securing leave when he could, writing incessantly to his wife, looking forward to the end of what he hoped was his last command. It was therefore with some reluctance that he agreed to a request from the first sea lord to take on the job of preparing to disarm the German navy when the enemy finally collapsed. That commission was a mark of the favour in which he now stood with his superiors. Unfortunately, fate kept him from ever completing it. The last enemy counter-offensive was in the end defeated, but at the time it seemed to threaten the supply line through Antwerp. Attentive as always to the focal point, Ramsay kept hard at work over the last week of 1944 lobbying his fellow commanders to stay on top of the problem. On 2 January 1945 he left his headquarters to attend a conference at the twenty-first army group to discuss further operations. His aircraft crashed on take-off at Toussus-le-Noble, killing all on board. Ramsay was buried on 8 January at St Germain-en-Laye, mourned by a large number of allied political and military leaders led by Eisenhower and Cunningham.<br>
<br>Ramsay's reputation has soared as the war in which he fought so well becomes a distant memory. He became known before the war for his insistence that a modern navy must emphasize training over instincts, organization over reflexes, and be far better prepared to handle those campaigns in which it would co-operate with the other services and allies. The course of the war and his own service in it vindicated all those insights. Ramsay never led a fleet to victory in a conventional engagement for command of the sea, but the whole point of his career was that the navy now needed more than this. Friends and peers such as Alan Brooke and Montgomery knew at the time what most historians now accept, namely, that in the eyes of the army at least, Ramsay was the most successful fighting admiral in the Royal Navy in the Second World War.<br>
