<span class="headword">Dixon,  Sarah</span>  (1671/2&#150;1765), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Kent, the daughter of James Dixon, a barrister originally of Rochester, Kent, who was admitted to the Middle Temple as a clerk on 20 May 1663 and called to the bar on 13 May 1670, and his wife, Elizabeth Soulhouse. Her only known brother, James Dixon, matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 17 February 1694, aged seventeen, but seems to have died soon afterwards; he was not awarded a degree. Details of Dixon's life are sparse and sometimes contradictory. She may have been born in Newnham, though much of her life seems to have been spent in or near St Stephen's parish, near Canterbury.<br>
<br>Dixon is known from her single volume of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, published anonymously in Canterbury in 1740 but attributed to her in inscriptions in the Bodleian and British Library copies of the book. The 500 subscribers to this volume were chiefly local, but some members of the nobility, as well as better-known poets, including Elizabeth Carter and Alexander Pope, also appear on the list. Additional poems bearing individual dates were transcribed onto the endpapers of the British Library copy from a manuscript owned by Dixon's niece, a Mrs Eliza Bunce (<i>n&eacute;e</i> De Langle), possibly the child of an unidentified sister. Eliza Bunce was the widow of the Revd John Bunce (<i>d</i>. 1786), vicar of St Stephen's, who encouraged Dixon's writing and corrected it for publication. This volume also has appended a poem &#145;On the Ruins of St Austin's, Canterbury&#146;; it was published in the <span class="italic">Kentish Gazette</span> of 9 July 1774, and was said to have been written some time after Dixon was seventy-three years old.<br>
<br>An inscription in the Bodleian copy of Dixon's <span class="italic">Poems</span> describes her as a widow. However, a memorial stone in the chancel floor of St Stephen's identifies her as the daughter of James Dixon, barrister. Her writings contain references to members of her family: one, from 1739, is addressed to John and Eliza Bunce on the death of their young daughter; another, among those published in her <span class="italic">Poems</span> in 1740, is entitled &#145;On the Death of my Dear Brother, Late of University College, Oxford&#146;. There are, conspicuously, no references or dedications to a husband or child.<br>
<br>Dixon's verse is chiefly pastoral; her preface suggests a source for her poetic impulse in the peaceful solitude of her youth in the country. Individual poems range from light but pointed satire on the follies and failings of women, through romantic, ballad-like lyrics, to earnest, mature, religious verse. She characteristically underplays her education, intellect, and talent as a &#145;weaker Woman&#146;, but her religious rationalization of women's intellectual and social position in relation to men has a rather bitter tone:<blockquote>
<div>Eve's Theft serv'd but to dignify Man's Soul,<br>
</div>
<div>Her Sex denied the Knowledge which she stole.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The only other recorded detail of Sarah Dixon's life also comes from the memorial stone at St Stephen's. She died on 23 April 1765 at the age of ninety-three.<br>
