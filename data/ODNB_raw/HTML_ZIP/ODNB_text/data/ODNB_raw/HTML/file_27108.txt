<span class="headword">Tempest,  Pierce</span>  (1653&#150;1717), <span class="occ">printseller</span>, was the sixth son of Henry Tempest of Tong in Yorkshire and his wife, Mary Bushall; his eldest brother, John, was the first baronet. This background gave him the entr&eacute;e to the circles of virtuosi in London where he spent his entire career, although he maintained his link with York, and was particularly close to Francis Place and William Lodge, both of whose work he published.<br>
<br>Tempest was in London by November 1678, when he established himself in the Strand as a publisher of prints, one of the most important of his day. The range of his production, which still awaits full investigation, was very varied; the mezzotints he published are all datable to between about 1683 and 1688. Tempest seems never to have put an address on his plates, and his advertisements and letters give such a motley collection of addresses as to suggest that he preferred dealing from home to keeping a shop. His most important publications were the six sets of bird and animal designs engraved by Place and Griffier from 1686 onwards from newly commissioned drawings by Francis Barlow, and the famous series entitled <span class="italic">The Cries of London</span> drawn by Marcellus Laroon and engraved by John Savage; this began with forty plates in 1687 and expanded to seventy-four by the summer of 1689. After 1700 Tempest published fewer plates, though he kept his older ones in print. He now turned his attention to dealing in old master prints and drawings, and became a friend and supplier to such important collectors as the Talmans. In 1709 he published a translation of Cesare Ripa's <span class="italic">Iconologia</span> (1593) illustrated by Isaac Fuller the younger.<br>
<br>Tempest died on 1 April 1717 and was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden. In his will he asked his brother Nicholas to supervise the education of his illegitimate only child, George (a task that his brother refused). The will was proved on 24 April by Hannah Williams, the mother and guardian of George.<br>
