<span class="headword">Read,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1588), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, is presumed to have been a native of Gloucestershire. He was apparently in practice in Gloucester in 1587, since he describes his involvement in the prosecution of a Flemish quack in that year, although &#145;the matter was excused by way of charitie to be good to straungers&#146;. Read probably came to London later that year. He was licensed by the archbishop of Canterbury on 6 January 1588, and on 24 June that same year was licensed to marry Cicely, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1280/', "John Banister")</script>, lecturer in anatomy to the London Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons. Banister had been admitted to the company as a foreign brother in 1572, but Read never joined, although he was on friendly terms with some of its leading members. He was one of a group of late sixteenth-century London surgeons, including Banister, William Clowes, and Thomas Gale, who endeavoured to raise the status of their profession. His principal claim to fame is his <span class="italic">A most excellent and compendious method of curing woundes in the head, and in other partes of the body</span>, published in 1588 but evidently completed in the preceding year; it was entered in the Stationers' register on 10 November 1587. It is for the most part a translation of <span class="italic">De recta curandorum vulnerum ratione</span> by Franciscus Arcaeus, but also includes John Arderne's <span class="italic">Treatise of the Fistula</span>, as well as an English version of the Hippocratic oath, various miscellaneous pieces, and substantial interpolations by Read. The dedication, addressed to Banister, Clowes, and William Pickering, described as &#145;my very good and loving friends&#146;, reiterates Read's beliefs &#145;that all chirurgians ought to be seene in phisicke [examined in medicine]: and that the barbors crafte ought to be a distinct mistery from chirurgery&#146;. The latter of these desiderata came to pass in 1745 when the barbers and surgeons became separate companies, and the former in 1868 when the royal colleges of Physicians and Surgeons introduced reciprocal representation on their examining boards, followed in 1884 by the establishment of the conjoint examining board. Read further stresses his belief in the unity of medicine and surgery in a six-page poem entitled &#145;A Complaint of the Abuse of the Noble Arte of Chirurgerie&#146;. The other theme running through Read's work is his opposition to the activities of quacks, and he refers several times to the earlier writings of John Hall of Maidstone on this subject.<br>
