<span class="headword">Torshell,  Samuel</span>  (1605&#150;1650), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 4 June 1605, the son of Richard Torshell, a London merchant tailor, and his wife, who was a midwife. He was at Merchant Taylors' School from 1617 until 1620 and matriculated as a sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1621. He graduated BA in 1625 and proceeded MA in 1628. In 1628 Torshell was appointed lecturer at St Bartholomew by the Exchange in London with a salary of &pound;50. The following year he was appointed preacher at Bunbury in Cheshire by the London Haberdashers' Company. His first publication, <span class="italic">The Three Questions of Free Justification, Christian Liberty, the Use of the Law</span> (1632), was dedicated to the company. The following year he published nine sermons preached at Bunbury, under the title <span class="italic">The Saints Humiliation</span> (1633), and dedicated them also to the master and wardens of the company. It was probably Torshell who on 25 July 1632 had married Prudence Stock, at St Vedast, Foster Lane, or St Michael-le-Querne. A Prudence, daughter of Richard Stock, had been baptized in 1608 at St Matthew, Friday Street, and it is likely that the 1632 bride was the daughter Prudence mentioned in the will of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26540/', "Richard Stock (1568/9&#150;1626)")</script>, rector of All Hallows, Bread Street, and famed puritan minister.<br>
<br>In 1633 Archbishop Neile complained that as a result of the company's patronage Bunbury was &#145;a good nursery of Novelists&#146;  (Richardson, 12). Torshell himself was later to assert that &#145;I never thought Episcopacie to be Divine Right &hellip; yet I looked upon it as the most antient and prudentiall way of government, and so obeyed it and spoke well of it, though not its mad and furious ways.&#146; In particular Torshell disliked the altar policy of the 1630s, the suppression of godly preachers, and the overuse of excommunication. He claimed that he was finally persuaded of the &#145;inconveniencies and mischiefes&#146; of episcopacy by John White's speech against it in parliament  (<span class="italic">The Hypocrite Discovered and Cured</span>, 1643, A3<i>v</i>). Torshell was also entrusted with Richard Stock's papers. In 1641 he prepared Stock's <span class="italic">A Learned and Very Usefull Commentary upon the Whole Prophesie of Malachy</span> (1641) for the press and it appeared in the same volume as Torshell's own <span class="italic">Exercitation upon the Same Prophesie of Malachy</span>.<br>
<br>At the end of 1642 Torshell left Bunbury for London &#145;to seeke refuge in these more safe coverts&#146;  (Torshell, <span class="italic">A Helpe to Christian Fellowship</span>, 1644, foreword). In 1643 he clarified his support for parliament in two publications, <span class="italic">The Hypocrite Discovered and Cured</span> and <span class="italic">A Case of Conscience, Concerning Flying in Times of Trouble</span>, in which he complained of those who &#145;came up to the Parliaments sense in the head of the Tyde, [but] are willing to shrinke away in the Ebbe of things&#146; and argued that &#145;if we love the publicke cause, wee must not onely keepe it company in its health, but stand by it and comfort it in its faintings&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Case of Conscience</span>, A2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). Torshell had not forgotten his godly contacts in Cheshire, however, and in the following year he published two sermons dedicated to Jane Done of Utkinson in testimony of &#145;how deare your religious family and all our Christian neighbourhood, are unto my thoughts&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Helpe to Christian Fellowship</span>, foreword).<br>
<br>In the spring of 1644 Torshell was appointed tutor to the king's two youngest children when they were committed by parliament to the custody of Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland. His sermon delivered that year on 28 December on the birthday of Princess Elizabeth was published as <span class="italic">The Womans Glorie: a Treatise, Asserting the Due Honour of that Sexe</span> (1645), in which he argued that women were &#145;capable of the highest improvements&#146; and that &#145;the whole Sexe [was] unduly reproached&#146;. Although Torshell took a positive view of women's abilities, he was also wholly conventional in arguing that these could best be developed by the pursuit of piety and that women were in subjection to men. On 12 May 1646 he delivered a sermon, <span class="italic">The Palace of Justice</span>, to the House of Commons in thanksgiving for the taking of several garrisons as the first civil war reached its close. That year Torshell was admitted as vicar of St Giles Cripplegate, London, but a successor was admitted the following year. He also published <span class="italic">A Designe about Disposing the Bible into an Harmony</span> (1647), a plan for transposing the order of biblical books and chapters to create a continuous history. On his deathbed he appointed his wife, Elizabeth, as his executor. He had already provided for his eldest son, Richard, who had been apprenticed at the cost of &pound;50, and he left &pound;40 each to his four other children. Torshell died on 22 March 1650.<br>
