</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pegge,  Samuel</span>  (1704&#150;1796), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born on 5 November 1704 in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the only child of Christopher Pegge (<i>bap</i>. 1677, <i>d</i>. 1723/4), successively a cloth merchant in Derby and a lead merchant in Chesterfield, and three times mayor of Chesterfield, and his first wife, Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1709), daughter of Francis Stephenson of Unstone in Dronfield. Samuel's parents were distant cousins. Of the four branches of the Pegge family in Derbyshire, Christopher belonged to that long established at Osmaston by Ashbourne, while Gertrude was descended from Edward Pegge of Beauchief. From another branch in Yeldersley came Katherine Pegge, mother of two of King Charles II's illegitimate children, including Charles FitzCharles (1647&#150;1680), later earl of Plymouth.<br>
<br>Samuel Pegge was educated at Chesterfield and in 1722 became a scholar of St John's College, Cambridge. On the deaths of his father and the heir of his maternal grandfather, he inherited the Pegge estates in Osmaston by Ashbourne and half the Stephenson estates in Unstone. He graduated BA in 1725 and successfully applied in 1726 for a fellowship on the Beresford foundation at St John's, only to be removed in favour of Michael Burton, later vice-master, when the latter claimed founder's kin. Pegge was then regarded as an honorary fellow of the college until, on graduating MA in 1729, he was elected to a Platt fellowship. During his time at Cambridge, scholarly clubs modelled on the Society of Antiquaries were becoming fashionable. The Zodiac Club, founded in 1725, included Pegge as the original Mars among its twelve members from 1730 until he left the university in 1732. In 1730 he joined the Spalding Gentlemen's Society as a contributing member.<br>
<br>Pegge was ordained a priest in the Church of England in February 1730 and the following month became curate to the Revd Dr John Lynch, later dean of Canterbury, at Sundridge in Kent. Through Lynch, Pegge became vicar of Godmersham, also in Kent, in December 1731 and this preferment prompted him to marry, on 13 April 1732, Anne Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1746), the only daughter and heir of Benjamin Clarke of Stanley near Wakefield. Of their three children, the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21780/', "Samuel Pegge (1733&#150;1800)")</script>, became a barrister and an antiquary himself, the second, Christopher (<i>d</i>. 1736), died in infancy, and the third, Anna Katherine (1735&#150;1816), married the Revd John Bourne of Spital near Chesterfield, rector of Sutton cum Duckmanton.<br>
<br>In Kent Pegge developed his antiquarian interests, collecting books and coins, corresponding with like-minded contemporaries, researching, and writing. After his wife's death in July 1746, he decided to move to his native Derbyshire and in 1747 he was nominated by the dean of Lincoln, patron of the living, to Brampton near Chesterfield. The parishioners disputed this right of patronage and repelled Pegge &#145;by violence&#146; from entering the church for his induction in August 1748  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.236). Despite proof later that year at Derby assizes that the Brampton parish records had been falsified to support his opponent's claim, Pegge did not take up the living. From 1749 to 1751 he was tutor to the son of Sir Edward Dering at Surrenden in Kent and did not return to Derbyshire until 11 November 1751 on his appointment as rector of Whittington near Chesterfield, where he lived until his death. Pegge exchanged Godmersham for the rectory of Brindle in Lancashire, which he held for seven years until he obtained the living of Heath near Whittington. In 1765 he acquired the perpetual curacy of Wingerworth, also near Whittington. Through Frederick Cornwallis, his diocesan bishop, Pegge became a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral in 1757 and, additionally, in 1772 he was collated to the prebend of Louth in Lincoln Cathedral by his fellow collegian Bishop John Green.<br>
<br>On 14 February 1751 Pegge was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. To the classical and theological compositions of his youth, beginning in 1727 with the publication of a Latin ode on the death of King George I, he had added a body of predominantly antiquarian writings which increased substantially during his remaining forty-five years. Pegge was said to have been the most prolific of all contributors to the journal <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> with more than fifty published articles and memoirs. His topics were as diverse as Anglo-Saxon jewels, the introduction of the vine into Britain, and the manner of King John's death, as well as more immediately local subjects such as bull-running at Tutbury in Staffordshire. The influence of the antiquary William Stukeley can be seen in Pegge's &#145;Illustration of some druidical remains in the Peak of Derbyshire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 7/2, 19) and &#145;Discoveries on opening a tumulus in Derbyshire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 9/18, 189). Between 1746 and 1795 Pegge often wrote for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, using anagrams of his name like &#145;Paul Gemsege&#146; or the abbreviations &#145;T. Row&#146; (the rector of Whittington) or &#145;L. E.&#146;, the last letters of his first and family names. He contributed seven articles to <span class="italic">Bibliotheca topographica Britannia</span>, including &#145;The history of Eccleshall manor&#146; (1784), &#145;The Roman roads &hellip; discovered and investigated &hellip; through the &hellip; county of Derby&#146; (1784), and &#145;The history of Bolsover and Peak Castle, Derbyshire&#146; (1785). Among other major publications were his edition of Gustavus Brander's manuscript <span class="italic">The Forme of Cury: a Roll of Ancient English Cookery</span> (1780), <span class="italic">The Life of Robert Grossetete &hellip; Bishop of Lincoln</span> (1793), and the posthumously issued <span class="italic">Historical Account of Beauchief Abbey</span> (1801). Manuscript collections made by Pegge included two folio volumes on Kent entitled <span class="italic">Monasticon Cantianum</span>, an account of the antiquities of Wye in Kent, and a <span class="italic">Lexicon Xenophonticum</span>, together with eight folio volumes on Derbyshire history. The latter passed to his son, who gave them to John Nichols, the historian of Leicestershire, who in turn donated them in 1809 to the College of Arms where they remain.<br>
<br>On the centenary of the revolution of 1688, Pegge at the age of eighty-four preached a sermon on the history of Revolution House in Whittington where the aristocratic conspirators supporting William of Orange were said to have met. On 8 July 1791 he was created LLD by the University of Oxford while on a visit there to his grandson, Christopher Pegge, later regius professor of physic. Both a sociable companion and a conscientious pastor, Samuel Pegge died aged ninety-one on 14 February 1796 at Whittington rectory and was buried on 19 February in the church. A memorial tablet was erected to him but it did not survive the fire which destroyed the church in 1895. Although Gustavus Brander's portrait of Pegge at eighty-one was reproduced as a frontispiece to <span class="italic">The Forme of Cury</span>, Elias Needham's oil painting of him at the same age was said to have been a better likeness.<br>
<br>Samuel Pegge typifies Stuart Piggott's &#145;uncritical and omnivorous&#146; eighteenth-century antiquary  (Piggott, <span class="italic">Ancient Britons</span>, 28), but his sometimes &#145;supremely ridiculous&#146; conclusions, in the judgement of Sir John Evans, should not obscure the significance of some of his prodigious output  (Evans, 7). He not only preserved historical information gathered by such earlier Derbyshire antiquaries as William Woolley, but was the first person to attempt to describe systematically the Roman road network in the county, and to publish inscriptions on lead pigs of the same era found in the Peak District. Pegge's pioneering work alerted contemporaries to the importance of topographical research, writing, and publishing and so laid the foundations for later field archaeologists and local historians, his son among them.<br>
