<span class="headword">Despard,  John</span>  (1743/4&#150;1829), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial administrator</span>, was born in Ireland and baptized on 4 August 1744 at St Peter and St Kevin in Dublin, the fifth of six sons of William and Jane Despard. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7548/', "Edward Marcus Despard")</script>. He began his military career at the age of sixteen as an ensign in the 12th foot during the Seven Years' War, when, at the battle of Warburg, the colours were shot from his hand. After service in the battle of Vellinghausen he was promoted lieutenant on 12 July 1762. Placed on half pay following the war, in 1767 he was appointed lieutenant in the 7th Royal Fusiliers. In 1773 he sailed with his regiment for Quebec, returned to England to recruit in 1774, and in May 1775 was sent from Quebec to the Canadian frontier at Fort St Johns, where he was later forced to surrender by insurgent Americans. In December 1776 he was exchanged and joined Sir William Howe in New York, where he was promoted captain on 25 March 1777. In October 1777 Despard served at the assault on Fort Montgomery, and in June 1778, as major, he organized Lord Rawdon's new loyalist corps, the Volunteers of Ireland. He then served as the army's deputy adjutant-general at the capture of Charles Town, South Carolina (1780), and acted in the same capacity with Lord Cornwallis's army in the south until the surrender at Yorktown. With the peace in 1783 he rejoined the fusiliers and had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel by 1791.<br>
<br>On 6 March 1793 Despard married Harriot Anne (1772&#150;1848), daughter of Thomas Hesketh and Jacintha Dalrymple, and the sister of Sir Thomas Dalrymple Hesketh, third baronet, of Rufford Hall, Lancashire. They had at least one daughter, Harriot Dorothea (<i>b</i>. 1795), who married Henry Francis Greville in 1816. Despard served as commander of the regiment at Quebec at some point during 1793 but in 1794 Prince Edward, commander of the forces in the Maritime provinces, ordered him to England where he again successfully recruited for the regiment. He returned to serve under the prince at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was promoted to the rank of colonel on 21 June 1795. In 1799 he was appointed, as major-general (from 21 June 1798), to the military command of Dorset; and it was while there, in August 1799, that Edward, now duke of Kent, offered him the post of military commander and civil administrator of the colony of Cape Breton, which Despard accepted.<br>
<br>The appointment to Cape Breton presented many challenges. The colony was governed through an executive council riven by power struggles. Despard's appointment was challenged by some council members, but he suppressed this faction by threatening to call out the militia. Turning to the development of the colony's potentially rich coal mines, he privatized them and improved wharf facilities so that production and shipments both increased. Since the colony had no house of assembly, taxes were not being collected. He persuaded the Treasury board to allow the collection of taxes by local ordinance, thereby giving the colony resources for internal improvements. With the concurrence of the home authorities he then organized an escheats court and seized large tracts of unoccupied properties, thus opening land to settlement. Shortly after, in August 1802, the first boatload of highland Scots sailing directly to Cape Breton found free land and assistance, which led to an eventual immigration of 25,000 highlanders to the island. Throughout Despard had to contend with political factions arguing for and against a house of assembly. The frustration of lacking the authority to decide this question and declining health, probably exacerbated by his brother's execution for treason, led to his departure in July 1807.<br>
<br>The remainder of Despard's life was spent in semi-retirement in England. On 25 June 1808 he was appointed colonel of the 12th Royal Veteran battalion, colonel of the 5th West India regiment in 1809, and, on 4 June 1814, general. He died on 3 September 1829, in his eighty-sixth year, at Swan Hill, Oswestry, from &#145;ulcerated intestines&#146;  (Oswestry church records), which had plagued him for many years. He was buried on 9 September in St Oswald's churchyard, Oswestry. Despard was a distinguished, resourceful, and brave soldier who demonstrated surprising governing abilities, all undertaken with a &#145;mild and chearful &hellip; disposition&#146;  (William Woodfall to Adam Gordon, 25 July 1805, CO 217, vol. 123, fol. 175).<br>
