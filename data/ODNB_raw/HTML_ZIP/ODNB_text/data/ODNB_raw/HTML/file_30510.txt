<span class="headword">Azad,  Abul Kalam</span>  (1888&#150;1958), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born on 11 November 1888 in Mecca, Arabia. His father, Sheikh Khairuddin Dehlavi (1831&#150;1908), was an Islamic scholar and Sufi who had migrated to Mecca about the time of the 1857 revolt and there had married an Arab woman, the niece of the mufti of Medina. Azad, the youngest child, had one brother and three sisters. His name at birth was Muhiyuddin Ahmad, but he adopted Abul Kalam Azad (&#145;free&#146;) as his pen-name in his teens, and that is the name by which he is known. The circumstances of his ancestry and birth meant that Azad was fluent in both Arabic and Urdu, which influenced his later thought and writing style.<br>
<br>In 1898 Khairuddin returned to India with his family and settled in Calcutta at the request of his many Sufi disciples in that city. Azad's mother died a year later, with the result that his father became the dominant figure in his upbringing. Azad was educated at home by his father in the traditional Indo-Islamic curriculum, which included Arabic, Persian, and Urdu languages, a thorough study of the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, the traditions of the prophet Muhammad (<i>hadith</i>), Islamic philosophy and theology, as well as mathematics. Contrary to some sources, he never studied at Cairo's al-Azhar, though he augmented his home-based religious education with insatiable reading, and his scholarly temperament and reputation for learning earned him the honorific <i>maulana</i>, indicating one who is trained in the Islamic religious sciences. He completed his education in his teens, and was married young. He and his elder brother, Abun Nasir, were married to sisters, the daughters of one of Khairuddin's disciples. Azad and his wife, Zulaikha (<i>d</i>. 1943), had one son, who died young.<br>
<br>Azad's intellectual precocity led him to revolt against his father's influence and against what he considered the rigidity of his education. His reading introduced him to the writings of Sir Saiyid Ahmad Khan, especially his commentary on the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, which opened up the world of Islamic modernism and the possibility of a reinterpretation of the scriptures. Given Azad's fluency in Arabic, he was able to read the works of Sheikh Muhammad Abduh and other Arab intellectuals, including Rashid Rida and the al-Manar group of Cairo, and thus learned of new religious and political ideas, including nationalism, in the Arab world. Further, Calcutta in the early twentieth century was a hotbed of Indian nationalist activity, with which he sympathized. His nationalism, consequently, derived from sources both Indian and Islamic; he saw no reason why the two should conflict.<br>
<br>Azad began to write for Urdu newspapers as a young man. In 1904 he started a journal, <span class="italic">Lisan us-Sidq</span>, in Calcutta. During the next few years he served as editor of <span class="italic">an-Nadwa</span> of Lucknow in 1905&#150;6, and of <span class="italic">Vakil</span> of Amritsar. In Lucknow he worked with Maulana Shibli, another consummate Urdu stylist in both prose and poetry, who encouraged him to be true to his religious training through the medium of his writing. In Amritsar he reported on current affairs, with a concentration on events in the Muslim world. He also made at least one trip to the Middle East, in connection with the hadj. He then returned to Calcutta, where he was at the time of his father's death in 1908. He refused to succeed Khairuddin as a religious guide, but instead chose to guide the reading public religiously and politically through his journalism.<br>
<br>In July 1912 Azad began his most famous journalistic venture, the weekly <span class="italic">al-Hilal</span>. For the next four years, through <span class="italic">al-Hilal</span> and its successor, <span class="italic">al-Balagh</span>, Azad became known as an eloquent proponent of religious reform based almost exclusively on the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, and as an advocate of Muslim political activism. His elegant prose had some of the emotional content of verse, and his Urdu, replete with Persian and Arabic words, added to his learned reputation. He broke with the loyalist politics of the Muslim League and supported Indian nationalism, and he sympathized with Turkey during the Balkan wars of 1912&#150;13. In the First World War, when Turkey and Britain were enemies, his pro-Turkish stance led to a forfeiture of <span class="italic">al-Hilal</span>'s security deposit. He then began <span class="italic">al-Balagh</span>, but that too was closed in 1916. He was interned by the British in Ranchi, Bihar, from 1916 until after the war, released only in January 1920. During his internment he wrote a lyrical autobiography, <span class="italic">Tazkirah</span>, and began a translation and commentary on the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, <span class="italic">Tarjuman al-Quran</span>.<br>
<br>Following his release Azad joined forces with Mahatma Gandhi and the Ali brothers in the combined <i>khilafat</i> and non-co-operation movement against the British. This movement brought about a co-operation between Hindus and Muslims in Indian nationalist politics as never before, and featured the Gandhian technique of non-violent protest against British dominance. Muslim religious and political leaders, including Azad, were concerned about the punitive European treaty of peace with the Ottoman caliphate (<i>khilafat</i>) following the First World War, but they also saw the <i>khilafat</i> as an issue that could unite all Indian Muslims against the British. Gandhi saw the issue as a means of gaining a Muslim following for the Indian National Congress in its bid to represent all Indians in the movement for independence. Between 1920 and 1922 Azad became an accomplished orator and political figure. He was imprisoned in 1922, as were Gandhi and the movement's other leaders. Released in 1923, Azad was elected president of the special session of the National Congress held in Delhi to decide the future course of nationalist action. He called for Hindu&#150;Muslim co-operation, but divisions over tactics persisted in the Congress through the 1920s. Gandhi again launched a nationwide civil disobedience movement in 1930, against the salt tax. Azad took part and was again imprisoned, but during the late 1920s and early 1930s he concentrated on his commentary on the <span class="roman">Koran</span>.<br>
<br>Azad became prominent in nationalist politics again after the 1937 legislative elections, the first held under the 1935 <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span>, which established provincial autonomy and expanded the legislatures. He was chosen as a member of the National Congress's parliamentary board to supervise its provincial ministries. In 1940 he was elected president of the Congress and held that office until 1946, an unusually long tenure resulting from the disruptions of wartime and the fact that the Congress leaders spent most of the war imprisoned. While a prisoner in Ahmadnagar Fort, he wrote <span class="italic">Ghubar-i-khatir</span>, an epistolary memoir that reveals more of his spiritual and intellectual odyssey than any of his other works.<br>
<br>As president of the Congress Azad played a pivotal role in the negotiations leading to India's independence, particularly during the Simla conference in 1945 and the cabinet mission of 1946. He remained adamantly opposed to partition, feeling that a division of India would do more harm to Indian Muslims than good. His disagreement with the politics of the Muslim League and with its leader, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was fundamental. During the formation of the provisional government in 1946 Jinnah demanded for the League the right to name all Muslim members, while the Congress, with Azad in mind, maintained its right to name a Muslim. Azad, sensing that he was an obstacle to agreement, relinquished his presidency of the Congress to Nehru in July 1946 and stayed out of the provisional government when it was formed in September. He joined the government as education minister in January 1947 and remained in that office until his death.<br>
<br>Azad was a broken man after the 1947 partition, having lost the struggle to preserve India's unity. In the final decade of his life he presided over India's education policy, made many speeches on official occasions, and dictated a memoir of his political life, <span class="italic">India Wins Freedom</span> (1959; a complete version of the text was first published in 1988). In declining health as a result of a neglect of exercise and heavy smoking and drinking habits, he fell and broke his hip; he then suffered a stroke and died on 22 February 1958 in Delhi and was buried there in a tomb in front of Jama Masjid. He will be remembered for his intellectual integrity, his eloquent contributions to Urdu literature, and his courageous insistence that Muslim culture was an integral part of India's cultural life.<br>
