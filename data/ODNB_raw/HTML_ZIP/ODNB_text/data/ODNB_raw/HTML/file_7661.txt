<span class="headword">Dillon, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1579?), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the third son of James Dillon of Riverston, co. Meath, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Bartholomew Bathe of Dollardstown. His father was chief remembrancer and second baron of the exchequer about 1499. Robert probably received legal training at the inns of court, since nearly all of his contemporaries were in residence there prior to commencing their legal careers in Ireland. His eldest brother, Sir Bartholomew Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1534), became an important ally of the earl of Kildare, to whom Bartholomew owed promotion as chief baron of the exchequer and under-treasurer (1514&#150;20), second justice of king's bench (1520&#150;33), and chief justice of king's bench (1533&#150;4). Another brother, Thomas, was prior of the cathedral canons of Sts Peter and Paul in Trim, co. Meath, in 1511.<br>
<br>Dillon married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Barnewall of Crickstown and granddaughter of Sir Thomas Plunket (<i>d</i>. 1471), chief justice of common pleas. As a well-connected member of a distinguished family of jurists, Robert was named attorney-general of Ireland on 9 June 1534, at the outset of the Kildare rebellion. Though undoubtedly Catholic, he assisted in the dissolution of the Irish monasteries, receiving on 22 December 1538 the site of St Peter's Priory at Newtown, near Trim. Dillon made Newtown his principal seat, and he acquired the Carmelite monastery at Athnecarne, co. Meath, on 20 March 1546. He resided in Dublin, near St Patrick's Cathedral, from 1547, and in 1548 he acted as civil governor of Athlone. He became second justice of queen's bench on 17 January 1554, and was commended for his discretion and learning. On 9 November 1556 Dillon travelled with John Plunket on a commission to Munster to take depositions in a controversy between the lord of Upper Ossory and the earl of Ormond. A witness to constant political intrigue, Dillon was a survivor who established the family's fortune without risking his investment in partisan alignments at court.<br>
<br>Elizabeth renewed Dillon's appointment in January 1559, and on 3 September 1559 he was made chief justice of common pleas with a fee of &pound;67 10<i>s</i>. He attended the Irish privy council regularly, served as commissioner for ecclesiastical causes on 6 October 1564, and was knighted by Sir Henry Sidney in 1567. He was frequently commissioner for martial law and for collection of the cess in co. Meath and won additional lands, including estates in Connaught worth &pound;30 in April 1568, and the monastery of Kilkenny West in co. Westmeath in 1569. Nevertheless, he was described by Sidney on 20 April 1567 as &#145;a man muche spent in yeares and decayed both in sence and bodie&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/20/142). After 1571 he was notably absent from meetings of the privy council, and on 8 March 1575 Elizabeth declared her intention of sending an Englishman to replace him on the bench. Lord Chancellor Sir William Gerard in 1576 cited Dillon's incapacity to serve on regular assize courts as part of the rationale for judicial reform, and on 5 July 1579 he wrote to Walsingham that Dillon had died. A famous quarrel over his succession in office ended with the trial and execution of his successor, Nicholas Nugent, and his replacement by Dillon's great-nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7662/', "Robert Dillon")</script> of Riverston. Dillon and his wife had four sons and three daughters, including his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7659/', "Sir Lucas Dillon")</script>, who joined his father on the privy council in 1570 as chief baron of the exchequer.<br>
