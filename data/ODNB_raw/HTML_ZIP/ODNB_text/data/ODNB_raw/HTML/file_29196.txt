<span class="headword">Whelpdale,  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1423), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was later said to have been born of a Cumbrian gentry family near Penrith. Educated at Oxford University, he was a fellow of Balliol College before 1400, and then became successively fellow, chamberlain, treasurer, and, in 1404, provost of Queen's College. He was senior proctor of the university in 1403&#150;4. The author of treatises on logic and mathematics, he had proceeded BTh before January 1413. His earliest promotions outside Oxford were in southern England, successively to the rectories of Stockton, Wiltshire, and Burghclere, Hampshire. It is not known to whose patronage he owed these benefices, or through whose agency he became bishop of Carlisle in 1419, following the death of William Strickland on 30 August. Licence to elect was given on 12 October, and Whelpdale was papally provided on 22 December. The temporalities of the see were restored on 17 March 1420, and he was consecrated in London on 21 August in that year, professing obedience to York on the same day.<br>
<br>Whelpdale's episcopate was brief, and all that can be said of it is that, like his predecessor, Whelpdale concerned himself with the protracted restoration of his cathedral, and in January 1422 obtained an indulgence for those contributing to the works. He was clearly not always resident in his diocese, and might, indeed, have been absent from it for some time, since on 22 November 1422 he was appointed to represent the northern province at the church council summoned to Pavia in 1423. Presumably his preparations for attendance account for his having been in London when he made his will, on 25 January 1423, and when he died there on 4 February following. He had requested burial in a church dedicated either to the Virgin, or to St Mary Magdalen, or to St Paul, and was consequently interred in St Paul's Cathedral in London.<br>
<br>Whelpdale's will shows him as concerned for his family, his see, and his <i>Alma Mater</i>. It also shows that he was a man of means, able to make bequests whose value amounted to about &pound;530, part of which was to be raised by the sale of property in Beverley, Oxford, and, apparently, north Kent. The beneficiaries of his will included a sister, a nephew, and a niece, and the children of Matthew Whelpdale, presumably also a relation. He left vestments, furnishings, and plate to Carlisle Cathedral, and &pound;200 to found a chantry there for two of his Cumbrian friends. He had brought books from Oxford to his official residence at Rose Castle; these, with other volumes of theology, political theory, and canon law, he now bequeathed to Queen's College, together with vestments, plate, &pound;10 for the repair of the vestry, and 20<i>s</i>. to buy keys to the library for the fellows. A more general bequest gave &pound;20 to be distributed among Oxford scholars.<br>
