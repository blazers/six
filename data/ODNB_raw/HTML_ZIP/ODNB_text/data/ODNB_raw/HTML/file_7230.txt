<span class="headword">Davies,  David Charles</span>  (1826&#150;1891), <span class="occ">Calvinistic Methodist minister and college head</span>, was born at Aberystwyth on 11 May 1826, the eldest son of Robert Davies (1790&#150;1841), a draper, and Eliza, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5146/', "David Charles")</script> of Carmarthenshire. His father was one of the leading laymen among the Calvinistic Methodists of Wales during the first half of the nineteenth century, and it was at his house in Great Darkgate Street, Aberystwyth, that their articles of faith (<span class="italic">Cyffes ffydd</span>) were drawn up in March 1823.<br>
<br>Davies was educated first at Aberystwyth under the noted mathematician John Evans (1796&#150;1861), who had also taught Lewis Edwards. He then went to Bala, where Lewis Edwards had opened an academy in 1837, later a theological college. In 1841 he went to Hanley as a private pupil of the Revd William Fletcher, a Congregational minister. At Hanley his occasional addresses to the Welsh colony prepared the way for the Welsh churches subsequently established in the Potteries. In November 1844, he became a student at University College, London, where his contemporaries included Walter Bagehot, Isaac Todhunter, Richard Holt Hutton, and Sir William Roberts. He graduated BA in 1847. After a short period at New College, Edinburgh, where he was taken ill, he returned to University College, London and graduated as MA in 1849, being placed second on the list. His parents had originally intended him for the bar but deep religious convictions led him to choose a ministerial career.<br>
<br>Davies began his career as a preacher in August 1848, at his home church, Tabernacl, Aberystwyth. Two years later he became minister of an English church at Newtown, Montgomeryshire. In 1850 he was admitted a member of the South Wales Association and was appointed its assistant secretary for two years. In 1852 he became pastor of the bilingual church of Alpha at Builth Wells and was fully ordained at the Llanelli Association on 4 August 1852. In November 1853 Davies left Builth Wells for the English church of Windsor Street, Liverpool, where he remained until March 1856. On 20 May 1857 he married Jane, third daughter of Ebenezer Cooper, a currier in Llangollen. They had no children. Davies resumed his old charge at Builth until May 1858, when he returned for a year to the English church at Newtown. In 1858 he moved to the Welsh church at Jewin Crescent, and remained there until 1876. Owing to failing health he returned to Wales and took charge of the English church at Menai Bridge, though he retained a connection with London until 1882.<br>
<br>Despite poor health, Davies contributed widely as a preacher, lecturer, author, and teacher, publishing several volumes of sermons, commentaries, lectures, and articles in the Welsh language. Much of his work was prepared for the press by friends or pupils, in some cases from shorthand notes taken at his lectures; a series of lectures &#145;Darlithiau ar Gristionogaeth&#146;, delivered in Welsh at London (1879&#150;1883), was published in <span class="italic">Y Traethodydd</span> (1881&#150;8) from the notes of Sir E. Vincent Evans. For many years Davies held a unique position, among Welsh nonconformists generally, owing to powers of analysis and abstract reasoning unrivalled among his contemporaries. A powerful and influential preacher and teacher, his sermons and writings made a strong appeal to both Welsh and English congregations of all ages. During his years as a preacher, repeated efforts were made to induce him to undertake educational work at one of the denominational colleges. As early as 1861 he was offered a tutorship at Trevecca College, while the principalship was offered to him in 1863 and 1864. Twelve years later, in 1873, he was invited to succeed John Parry as principal at Bala. In 1888, he eventually agreed to accept the principalship of Trevecca, following the death of William Howells. However, his tenure of the post lasted only three years, for he died on 26 September 1891, at his house, Bronhwfa, Bangor, and was buried on 30 September at the cemetery, Aberystwyth. His wife survived him.<br>
