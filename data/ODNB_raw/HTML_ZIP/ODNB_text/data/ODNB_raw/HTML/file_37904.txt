<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1615, <em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was baptized on 10 January 1615, the third but second surviving son of William Robinson DD, of Long Whatton, near Loughborough, archdeacon of Nottingham (1635&#150;42), and his wife, Sarah, daughter of William Bainbridge of Lockington. He began life with strong connections with the church: his father was half-brother to Archbishop William Laud. Robinson spent the years of the civil war and interregnum building up business interests and achieving prominence in City politics. During the 1650s he served as master of the Clothworkers' Company and an assistant of the Levant Company. He married in December 1654 Anne (<i>d</i>. 1699), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29319/', "Sir George Whitmore")</script> of Balmes, Hackney, Middlesex, lord mayor of London in 1631&#150;2. They had four sons (the eldest of whom died in 1679) and five daughters. From 1655 until his death he was an alderman of London, and was sheriff in 1657/8.<br>
<br>Robinson was, nevertheless, as his connections might suggest, a royalist, and after the death of Oliver Cromwell he worked to promote a Stuart restoration. He was involved in the royalist plot of 1659, and in February 1660 negotiated with General George Monck (later first duke of Albemarle) on the City's behalf during its confrontation with the Rump Parliament. On 26 May 1660 he was knighted, and he was created baronet the following month. Robinson established a close relationship with Monck and was himself returned to the Convention Parliament for London.<br>
<br>Robinson and his allies in London were spectacularly defeated in the election of 1661. He was returned in November for Rye instead, and was also elected to the 1679 parliament for the same seat. But Robinson was more important to the restored monarchy as financier and metropolitan administrator. He was one of the most regular lenders to the government, and in 1662 he became head of a syndicate which contracted to farm the excise for London, Middlesex, and Surrey. His appointment as lieutenant of the Tower in June 1660 placed him in a position vital to the maintenance of order in the City. In 1662/3 he served as lord mayor of London. During the 1660s and 1670s he was one of the principal means by which the government sought to influence City politics. His position, both in the City and at the Tower, impelled him into political controversy, particularly during the exclusion crisis, when he was accused of suppressing information on the Popish Plot, and when his removal was demanded by the House of Lords and his conduct inquired into by the House of Commons. The king succumbed to the pressure and dismissed him in May 1679.<br>
<br>Robinson continued an active City merchant. He was a member of the new Company of Royal Adventurers trading into Africa from its inception, and was an assistant in 1666&#150;8 and 1670&#150;71; he was a committee member of the East India Company in 1666&#150;7, 1668&#150;74, and 1675&#150;7; deputy governor of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670&#150;75; and an elder brother of Trinity House from 1670 to his death. Samuel Pepys regarded him as boastful and empty-headed; but his bombast must have concealed political shrewdness and commercial acumen. Robinson died in February 1680 and was succeeded by his second son, John (<i>b</i>. 1660).<br>
