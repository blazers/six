<span class="headword">Phillips,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1644), <span class="occ">clergyman and colonist in America</span>, was the son of Christopher Phillips of South Rainham, Norfolk. His exact date of birth and mother's name are unknown. He was admitted sizar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 10 April 1610, graduated BA in 1614, and proceeded MA in 1617. He served as vicar at Boxted, Essex, and was actively associated with other puritan clergy in the region, and his views on church government were endorsed by his friend John Rogers. By 1626 he had married a daughter of Richard Sergeant and with their two children they joined the great migration to New England in 1630, sailing with Governor John Winthrop. They settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. A church covenant was signed in July 1630 and Phillips became the pastor of the church. At its first meeting, in August 1630, the colony's court of assistants voted to have a house built for Phillips at colony expense. His assistant was John Sherman, who had been a pupil of John Rogers. Phillips's wife died during their first winter in the New World and he later married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1674), the widow of Robert Welden; this second marriage produced nine children.<br>
<br>Phillips was the congregation's sole clergyman until in 1642 he was joined in the Watertown ministry by John Knowles. He was a strong advocate of congregationalist polity and laboured to establish the autonomy of local churches, yet rejected calls for separation from the Church of England. He is thought to have been the author of <span class="italic">The humble request of his majesties loyall subjects, the governor and company late gone for New England</span> (1630), that stressed that the colonists were not severing their connections with the national church; yet when colony officials came to Watertown to advise on a dispute over the fitness of one of the congregation to be an elder, Phillips insisted that they come not as magistrates but simply members of a neighbouring congregation. The same concern for local authority led him to join a Watertown protest against taxes imposed by the colony's government in 1632. He was, nevertheless, strongly respected by the colony's leaders. He served as one of the committee charged by the Massachusetts general court, the colony's legislature, to compile the laws issued in 1641 as the <span class="roman">Body of Libertyes</span>. In 1642 he was appointed to the board of overseers of Harvard College.<br>
<br>Phillips kept in touch with his friends in England and became involved in the religious disputes of the times. Shortly after his arrival in New England he composed a defence of the sacraments against Baptist views, and in the course of his argument expounded the nature of the church. He took the view that England had been Christianized by early disciples prior to the rise of the papacy, but he did acknowledge the Church of Rome to be in some sense a true church, if in error, until such time as God would terminate its existence. When these views became known Governor John Winthrop, together with elders of the Boston church, travelled to Watertown to discuss Phillips's views. Following a debate before the congregation, all, including pastor Phillips, were said to be in agreement that the Church of Rome was not to be regarded as a true church, and Phillips did nothing to publish his treatise.<br>
<br>However, the appearance in 1643 of Thomas Lamb's <span class="italic">A Confutation of Infants Baptisme</span> prompted the publication of Phillips's earlier work as a refutation of Lamb. In the event this was arranged by friends as Phillips himself died in Watertown on 1 July 1644 and was buried there the next day. His <span class="italic">A Reply to a Confutation of Some Grounds for Infant Baptisme</span> (1645) was welcomed by English Independents and others disturbed by the spread of Baptist views. While maintaining that the outward forms of ceremonies and sacraments were less important than the spiritual truth that underlay them, and denying that baptism was a guarantee of saving grace, Phillips defended the importance of infant baptism for the growth of the church.<br>
