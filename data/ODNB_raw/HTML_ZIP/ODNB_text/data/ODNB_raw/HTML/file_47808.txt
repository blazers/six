<span class="headword">Manning,  William</span>  (1763&#150;1835), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 1 December 1763, the only surviving son of William Manning, merchant, of the parish of St Mary Axe in the City of London, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heir of John Ryan, a planter in St Kitts and Santa Cruz. The elder William Manning also came from a planter family on St Kitts, and soon after his marriage in 1751 started a merchant house in Bristol, trading to the West Indies, subsequently moving to London. His son joined the firm and took over on his father's death in 1791; he also inherited two-thirds of the Ryan estates on Santa Cruz from his mother, and purchased the remaining third. His status in the City was marked by his election to a directorship of the Bank of England in 1792. He remained a member of the court until 1831, serving as deputy governor (1810&#150;12) and governor (1812&#150;14). In 1793 he became a commissioner of exchequer bills; he also served as agent for St Vincent between 1792 and 1806, and for Grenada between 1825 and 1831.<br>
<br>In 1786 Manning married Elizabeth, the daughter of Abel Smith, a Nottingham banker, with whom he had two daughters. After her death, he remarried in 1792; his second wife was Mary (1771&#150;1847), daughter of Henry Leroy Hunter, a barrister of Reading, with whom he had four sons (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17970/', "Henry Edward Manning")</script>, the future cardinal) and four daughters. The connection with the Smith family took Manning into Pitt's circle, and in 1794 he entered the Commons as the member for Plympton Erle, subsequently sitting for Lymington (1796&#150;1806), Evesham (1806&#150;18), Lymington again (1818&#150;20 and 1821&#150;6), and Penryn until 1830. He was a staunch supporter of the government, promoting the loyal declaration of London merchants in 1795, and subscribing to the loyalty loan of 1797. He served as a volunteer in the London and Westminster light horse in 1797, before joining the Bank of England Volunteers in 1798, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1803. He was also a leading spokesman of the West Indies interest in the Commons, and was particularly active in the campaign for a dock to serve the West Indies trade. A committee of West Indies merchants was formed in 1795, and &pound;800,000 was subscribed to a company to construct the proposed dock. He submitted the petition for the bill in 1796, and was instrumental in the appointment of a select committee against the opposition of the City corporation, which feared a threat to its income from the quays on the Thames. Although the bill failed, it was reintroduced in 1797, and was finally approved at the end of 1799. Manning was also active in urging compensation for slave owners, but he denied that he opposed abolition of slavery.<br>
<br>By the 1790s Manning was a wealthy man at the heart of the City. He had a town house in Spring Gardens and a modest country house, Copped Hall, at Totteridge, on the outskirts of London; in 1813 he purchased the Coombe Bank estate at Sundridge, near Sevenoaks, for &pound;40,000, a property which was more fitting to his status. He was, Cardinal Manning later remarked, &#145;of the Old Church Established religion; a friend of the bishops, many of whom were his close personal friends&#146;, especially Wilberforce and Tomline; and he remembered his father as &#145;one of the justest, most benevolent, most generous men I ever knew&#146;, who had a &#145;refinement and delicacy of mind&#146; and a modest and sensitive aversion to display  (Purcell, 7&#150;8). These memories may say more about the cardinal's filial sentiments in old age than about his father's character, and may reflect the cares which descended on him from the end of the Napoleonic wars and the depression in the West Indies trade which marked a turning point in his prosperity. He was in difficulties in the 1820s, and in 1831 he became bankrupt. His son Henry, who led him away from his appearance before a commissioner of bankruptcy at the Guildhall, remembered &#145;his saying to me with much feeling, &#147;I have belonged to men with whom bankruptcy was synonymous with death.&#148; It was so to him&#146;  (Purcell, 71). He resigned from the Bank of England, sold his estate, and withdrew from business and public life. His friends bought a life interest in his wife's marriage settlement, and subscribed to an income which allowed him to survive in the shabby gentility of Gower Street and a cottage near Petworth. He died at Gower Street on 17 April 1835, probably with his bankruptcy still undischarged, and was buried at Sundridge, Kent. He was survived by his wife.<br>
