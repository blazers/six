<span class="headword">Ward,  Nathaniel</span>  (1578&#150;1652), <span class="occ">clergyman and compiler of a law code for Massachusetts</span>, was born in Haverhill, Suffolk, the second of five children of John Ward (<i>d</i>. 1598), lecturer successively of Haverhill, Writtle in Essex, and Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and his wife, Susan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1639). His brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28704/', "Samuel Ward (1577&#150;1640)")</script> and John (<i>d</i>. 1661), both followed their father in careers as clergymen. Ward's mother married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23995/', "Richard Rogers")</script>, lecturer at Wethersfield, Essex, some time after his father's death in 1598, thereby uniting two puritan clerical families. His stepbrothers by this marriage were the ministers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23970/', "Daniel Rogers")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23972/', "Ezekiel Rogers")</script>. He was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1596, and graduated BA in 1600 and proceeded MA in 1603. His wife, Elizabeth, remains a shadowy figure; they were married before 1606, when their first child was born. Ward decided to pursue a legal career and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1607. After completing his legal training, he travelled throughout northern Europe, studying under David Pareus, professor of theology at the University of Heidelberg, who probably persuaded him to change his career. Ward was ordained in 1618 and in the same year he edited his brother Samuel's sermon <span class="italic">Jethro's Justice of Peace</span>. From 1620 to 1624 he served as chaplain to the British merchants at Elbing, Prussia, but was back in England by 1626, when he was curate of St James's, Piccadilly. While in London Ward met Sir Nathaniel Rich, a landowner with strong puritan sympathies, who inspired his interest in the Massachusetts Bay Colony and who became his patron when he gave him the living as rector of Stondon Massey, Essex, in 1628. Ward became part of Thomas Hooker's Essex circle of puritan opposition to Archbishop Laud's attempts to standardize the Church of England. His willingness to conform to the church was questioned as early as 1628, and he supported William Sandcroft for the mastership of Emmanuel College in the same year. Sandcroft's successful election meant the college would continue to produce suitable candidates to occupy puritan pulpits. In 1629 Ward was one of forty-eight Essex ministers who signed a petition to Laud in support of Hooker. The petition was unsuccessful, and Hooker fled to Holland before settling in New England. Ward was offered a position as pastor to the Massachusetts Company, but he declined. However, he maintained an interest in the New England colony and corresponded with Governor John Winthrop to reserve space on an emigrant ship for two families in his congregation.<br>
<br>Ward's position in Essex came under threat during Laud's visitation of the county in 1631. He was accused of not wearing his surplice, of rejecting the ceremonies of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and of refusing to promote the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>. Using his legal background to good effect, he talked himself out of trouble on condition that he repaired his surplice and agreed to conform. He turned to his friend John Cotton for emotional support; Cotton, a central figure for puritans in the south-east of England, fled to Massachusetts in 1633. Despite being deeply involved in the project of puritan emigration to Massachusetts, Ward tried to save his position at Stondon when he was again called to account by Laud. However, on this occasion he failed, and was excommunicated and deprived in 1632. He emigrated to Massachusetts in 1634 and took up the pastorship of the church at Ipswich, which he held until 1636 when ill health forced him to retire. In 1639 Ward's two sons John and James, and his daughter Susanna, joined him in Massachusetts, where within a few months Susanna married Giles Firmin; presumably his wife had died by this date. In the same year Ward and Cotton, now living in Boston, were each requested to draft a code of laws for Massachusetts. It was Ward's model which was accepted after a complicated procedure (though portions of Cotton's contribution were added in the final version) and the Massachusetts &#145;body of liberties&#146; was adopted as law in 1641. Ward's code was based on a combination of English common law and biblical law, and was made up of 100 specific liberties which were accepted as the rights of the freemen of the colony. His concern for authority, especially in the limitation of the power of the magistrate and proper legal procedure, is evident throughout the code. His experiences and those of his puritan colleagues in England also had an influence, with freedom of assembly and movement, the right to bail, and an intolerant attitude to religious matters as characteristic. Ward's influence with the colonial government was considerable. In 1641 he preached the sermon for the general election and received a grant for 600 acres of land near Pentucket, afterwards Haverhill. Two years later he joined with other ministers, including his stepbrother Ezekiel on behalf of Essex county to protest at Winthrop's involvement in the affairs of Massachusetts's French neighbours. He also supported the persecution of religious radicals, most notably in the case of Anne Hutchinson. Ward continued to be a favourite of the freemen of Massachusetts, who often requested a sermon to commemorate events. He maintained his position despite his son James being arrested for theft while a student at Harvard; it was then realized that the &#145;body of liberties&#146; had no punishment recommended for burglary. Ward served on the committee to revise the laws in 1645 and also began work on <span class="italic">The Simple Cobbler of Agawam in America</span>, which offers a statement of his beliefs.<br>
<br>By 1646, perhaps inspired by his success in Massachusetts, Ward decided to return to England with the hope of helping to resolve the crisis in his homeland. He sent <span class="italic">The Simple Cobbler</span> ahead to his brother John, a member of the Westminster assembly, for publication, and gave his land to Harvard College before leaving Massachusetts. His son John stayed in the colony as minister at Haverhill; Ward's other children returned to England with him. <span class="italic">The Simple Cobbler of Agawam</span> proved to be a huge success. Published in 1647 under the pseudonym Theodore de la Guard, it quickly went through four editions. Ward's fame from his wittily written and many-layered rant against religious toleration and immoral women's fashions imported from France, together with a plea to the king to compromise with his people and end the civil war, resulted in his invitation to preach the monthly fast sermon before the House of Commons in June 1647. The sermon focused on the need for authority in the state and the importance of moderation and consideration in reform. He also censured the army for its control of parliament. The sermon was not well received and Ward was not voted thanks, nor did parliament order it to be printed. It was eventually printed with a covering letter by Ward, which identified the reasons for its unpopularity as &#145;My perswading so much to lament the King&#146; and &#145;some passages concerning the Army&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, sig. A3<i>v</i>). Ward continued his conservative approach and attacks on the army with another sermon of 1647, <span class="italic">A Religious Retreat Sounded to a Religious Army</span>, which advocated state control of the army so that it was &#145;neither a terror nor a burthen to the Country&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Religious Retreat</span>, 5). Early in 1648 Ward took the living at Shenfield, Essex. In that year he continued his protest at the army's control of the kingdom in a petition presented to parliament on behalf of the eastern association. Deploring religious toleration and the lack of religious union promoted by parliament and the army, he also advised against deposing the king and supported the idea of the kingdom as a mercy of continuity granted by God. The eastern association's concerns also included the practical matters of resolving the quartering and payment of soldiers. Ward continued to be an able preacher until the end of his life. He condemned the execution of Charles I along with his stepbrother Daniel and his son-in-law Firmin. He continued to write, and in 1650 he provided a prefatory poem for Anne Bradstreet's <span class="italic">The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America</span>. Ward died sometime before November 1652, when his successor at Shenfield started to keep the parish records.<br>
