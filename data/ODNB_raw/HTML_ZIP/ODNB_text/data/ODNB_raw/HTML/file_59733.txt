<span class="headword">Brown,  James Duff</span>  (1862&#150;1914), <span class="occ">librarian and compiler of music reference books</span>, was born on 6 November 1862 at 3 Reid Terrace, Stockbridge, Edinburgh, the second of seven children of James Brown of St Fergus, Aberdeenshire, a bookkeeper, and his wife, Margaret Douglas of Aberdeen (both <i>fl</i>. 1840&#150;1880). Family legend maintained that his grandmother, Elizabeth Smith, was descended from Rob Roy Macgregor, following a son's judicious change of name. Brown attended the Church of Scotland normal school in Edinburgh from 1871 until 1875, when he was apprenticed to a bookseller and publisher. His family moved to Glasgow in 1876, where he joined the bookselling business of W. R. McPhun. Finding his position uncongenial and the manager frequently drunk, he successfully applied for the post of library assistant at the new Mitchell Library.<br>
<br>Brown took up his appointment on Christmas day 1876 and was surprised to find the library closed (because the librarian, F. T. Barrett, was English, he reasoned). Working in a rapidly expanding library was an exciting experience, despite long hours, and Brown did not waste the opportunity for self-education. He rose early to pursue musical interests. In 1884 he became Glasgow correspondent to the <span class="italic">Musical Standard</span> and in 1886 published his important <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of Musicians</span>, later praised by George Grove. He edited George Chalmers's <span class="italic">Caledonia</span> (8 vols., 1887&#150;1902). On 1 September 1887 he married his cousin, Annie Watt of Waterbeck; three daughters survived.<br>
<br>In 1888 the Library Association of the United Kingdom met in Glasgow, when Brown spoke on dictionary catalogues, his first, timely, contact with members of his profession. The post of librarian at the newly established public library in Clerkenwell had been advertised, and Brown was appointed with a salary of &pound;150 per annum. Public libraries in London were the responsibility of vestries, and Brown was fortunate to influence from the start the planning of the service, including the design of a building. He employed female library assistants, a controversial rarity, but was always supported by his library committee, and especially by Henry W. Fincham, local antiquary and close friend.<br>
<br>Brown produced in 1889 a dictionary catalogue with an innovatory classified arrangement following the model of Edward Edwards at Manchester Public Library in the 1850s. From 1890 Brown was encouraged by John MacAlister, editor of the Library Association's journal <span class="italic">The Library</span>, to contribute regular columns on administration. He was the first public librarian since Edwards in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of Libraries</span> (1859) to concern himself with the minutiae of organization. He contributed to Thomas Greenwood's influential <span class="italic">Public Libraries</span> (3rd and 4th edns, 1890&#150;91), published <span class="italic">A Handbook of Library Appliances</span> (1892), and produced a stream of booklists, including one for J. F. Rowbotham's <span class="italic">Private Lives of the Great Composers</span> (1892). He published <span class="italic">Guide to the Formation of a Music Library</span> (1893), <span class="italic">British Musical Biography</span> (1897), and <span class="italic">Characteristic Songs and Dances of All Nations</span> (1901).<br>
<br>The most controversial innovation was sparked by visiting the American Library Association's conference in Chicago in 1893. Many American public libraries allowed access to the shelves; in Britain, borrowers ordered books from a catalogue after checking an indicator. On 1 May 1894 Clerkenwell became the first library in the country to adopt &#145;safe-guarded open-access&#146;. For several years a bitter, occasionally humorous, war raged in journals and pamphlets. Virulent opposition came from Alfred Cotgreave (1849&#150;1911), fellow librarian and patentee and manufacturer of the best-known library indicator. Brown ultimately won the day, and Clerkenwell became a mecca for librarians visiting London.<br>
<br>Brown issued a regular bulletin listing new accessions, another first, and supported classified lists of books over dictionary catalogues. He devised a classification scheme, after Edwards's example, which became the &#145;adjustable&#146; classification, described in his <span class="italic">Manual of Library Classification and Shelf Arrangement</span> (1898). Such was Brown's enthusiasm for librarianship as a science that in 1898 he founded the <span class="italic">Library World</span> (which became the <span class="italic">New Library World</span> in 1969). Brown could indulge his humour and opinions with like-minded contributors, such as L. S. Jast, and reported, with considerable licence, the doings of a librarians' social club, The Pseudonyms; he was Rob Roy.<br>
<br>In 1900 Clerkenwell was absorbed into the metropolitan borough of Finsbury; Brown became borough librarian. The year 1903 saw the publication of <span class="italic">Manual of Library Economy</span>, the first textbook of public library practice since Edwards's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (the final, seventh, edition, appeared in 1961). In 1904 Islington established a public library, using Brown's <span class="italic">Manual</span> as a model, and in 1905 he was appointed its first borough librarian, moving his family to 15 Canonbury Park South. Brown developed his classification scheme, published as the <span class="italic">Subject Classification</span> (1906), adopted by many libraries in preference to the Dewey system.<br>
<br>Work was an uphill struggle, for in 1906, despite a Liberal national government, most councils in London passed from Liberal to Conservative hands. The new council's support for public libraries was unenthusiastic, but they grudgingly admired Islington's new open-access central library, opened in 1907. In the same year Brown published <span class="italic">The Small Library</span>, a practical guide for domestic, church, or workplace libraries. Though Brown's book-buying budgets were severely cut, the classified catalogue of 1910 proved another model for other libraries.<br>
<br>Brown had been a stalwart of the Library Association, but resigned in 1911 because he disagreed with their policies. He advocated structural reform, but particularly opposed a professional register, believing that librarianship should be open to all. By now unwell, he handed the editorship of <span class="italic">Library World</span> to his nephew, James D. Stewart (1885&#150;1965), then working at Islington Library. In 1912 Brown, described as small, frail, and unobtrusive  (Jast, 248), suffered heart attacks, probably attributable to Bright's disease. He did little work but published a guidebook, <span class="italic">A British Library Itinerary</span> (1913). He died at home in Canonbury Park on 26 February 1914 and was buried at the Great Northern London cemetery, Southgate. His <span class="italic">Manual</span> and <span class="italic">Subject Classification</span> were continued by his nephew, Stewart.<br>
