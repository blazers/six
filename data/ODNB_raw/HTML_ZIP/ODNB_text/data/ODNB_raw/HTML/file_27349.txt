<span class="headword">Thorne,  William</span>  (1568?&#150;1630), <span class="occ">classical and Hebrew scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Semley, Wiltshire. His father, according to Oxford University records, was <i>plebeius</i>: neither a gentleman nor a clergyman. There is no record of any marriage. Thorne entered Winchester College in 1582 and New College, Oxford, in 1586, and graduated BA on 12 April 1589. He proceeded MA in 1592, and later the same year published <span class="italic">Ducente Deo Willelmi Thorni Tullius seu <i>R&#275;t&#333;r</i>, in tria stromata diuisus</span>, a commonplace book reorganizing Cicero's ideas on rhetoric into logical categories, with extensive references to a wide range of other sources, especially Aristotle and the Hellenistic rhetoricians. <span class="italic">Ducente Deo</span> was the first work to be dedicated to William Herbert, future earl of Pembroke, who was then twelve years old. There was apparently a pre-existing link between Thorne's family and the Pembrokes, since William acknowledged their generosity towards his family in the dedication. The work also included a dedicatory verse by John Case, the well-known Aristotelian, and Thorne himself wrote a verse for Case's posthumous work <span class="italic">Lapis philosophicus</span> (1600). About the same year Thorne assembled a manuscript anthology of verse in praise of Thomas Sackville, baron of Buckhurst, then newly appointed chancellor of Oxford University.<br>
<br>Thorne and his collaborators exhibited their linguistic skills, including poems in both Latin and Greek, and he peppered his prose dedication with Hebrew expressions. Licensed to preach in 1597, he qualified BD in 1600, and DD in 1602. At his vespers or doctoral disputation, he defended the positions of the Church of England on the canonicity of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and made enough of an impression to be cited as an authority in Thomas Pye's <span class="italic">Epistola ad Iohannem Honsonum</span> (&#145;Epistle to John Honson&#146;, 1603). He was regius professor of Hebrew from 1598 to 1604. There is good evidence of Thorne's ability in Hebrew, since there are extant letters and poems written to him in Hebrew; he is known to have written at least one poem in Hebrew, and he was a frequent correspondent of the famous Dutch Hebraist Johan Drusius. The latter dedicated a work to him, <span class="italic">Opuscula quae ad grammaticam spectant</span> (1609) in gratitude for Thorne's generosity in taking in Drusius's son for two years in Oxford. In that work, there is a quotation in Syriac and a remark implying that Thorne also knew that language. There is, in addition, ambiguous evidence that he knew Arabic.<br>
<br>With the accession of James I, Thorne published his second book, an English sermon addressed to the king: <span class="italic"><i>Esoptron basilikon</i>, or, A Kenning-Glass for a Christian King</span> (1603), an extended interpretation of Pontius Pilate's words, &#145;behold the man&#146;. A document signed by fifteen bishops in 1605 or 1606 recommends Thorne for promotion, referring to him as the king's chaplain and as one of the Oxford translators of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He received much preferment: he was installed dean of Chichester on 30 December 1601 and in the same year was presented to the rectory of Tollard Royal, Wiltshire. He resigned his fellowship in 1602, and was collated to the prebend of Bussall in 1603, which he also resigned the following year. In 1606 he became vicar of Amport, Hampshire, and in 1607 he was presented to the rectory of Birdham, Sussex. In 1613 he was collated to the prebend of Hova Villa. In 1616 he became rector of North Marden, Sussex, and in 1619 of Warblington, Hampshire. He died on 13 February 1630 and was buried in Chichester Cathedral.<br>
