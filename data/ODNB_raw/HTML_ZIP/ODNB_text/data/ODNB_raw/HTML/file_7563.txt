<span class="headword">Deverell <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Pedley]</span>,  Robert</span>  (1760&#150;1841), <span class="occ">author and classical scholar</span>, was born in May or June 1760, the second son of Simon Pedley of St Stephen's, Bristol, and his wife, a daughter of Robert Deverell, a merchant of Bristol. He was educated in Bristol in a school run by a Mr Lee, and matriculated in April 1777 at Brasenose College, Oxford, whence he migrated to St John's College, Cambridge, in June of that year. In 1782 he won the college's Latin essay prize, and he held a fellowship from 1784 to 1791. Having been recommended by Nathaniel Ryder, Lord Harrowby, he acted as tutor to the future politician and diarist Sir Robert Heron, who later recalled that Pedley had &#145;some learning and much ignorance, but being a little mad, his strange ideas taught me to think for myself. We spent two summers together in France, Germany and Holland&#146;  (Heron, 291).<br>
<br>Having been admitted to Lincoln's Inn in June 1784, Pedley was called to the bar (19 April 1788) and practised at 2 Lincoln's Inn Stone Buildings, though his name disappears from the <span class="italic">Law List</span> at some point after 1805. He adopted his mother's family name in lieu of his father's by royal licence on 25 June 1793. At the general election of 1802 he was brought in for Saltash by William Beckford, the politician and art connoisseur, for whom his brother John Pedley acted as estate manager in the West Indies. In line with his patron, he generally supported the administration, but occasionally displayed a streak of independence, as exemplified by his vote against the Additional Force Bill promoted by Pitt, the prime minister (8 June 1804). In 1806 he published <span class="italic">Two Letters &hellip; to &hellip; William Pitt on the Ancient Aries, or Battering Ram</span>, which suggested a strategy for destroying the French fleet at Boulogne, and advanced a claim <i>en passant</i> that the ancient civilizations had possessed a knowledge of firearms, but had &#145;concealed all their knowledge under aenigmatical disguises&#146;  (p. 15): similar suppositions informed many of his other writings. A despondent footnote adds that after Pitt's death he had laid his scheme before &#145;a highly distinguished person&#146;  (ibid.), but had received no reply after &#145;many months&#146;  (ibid.). His interventions in Commons debate were apparently less arcane, and were made chiefly in support of the slave trade, the continuance of which was decidedly in Beckford's interest: Deverell claimed once to have been as keen a champion of abolition as Wilberforce himself, but to have undergone a very convenient Damascene conversion. On the same subject he published <span class="italic">A Letter to Samuel Whitbread</span> (1807) in which he frankly admitted that any defence of the trade rested on &#145;political expediency&#146;. In the meantime his parliamentary career had come to an end at the dissolution in October 1806.<br>
<br>Deverell's posthumous repute rested on his other extraordinary publications, which made him a regular subject of enquiry for incredulous correspondents of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. <span class="italic">Alter et idem, a New Review</span> (1794) was apparently intended, but not pursued, as a series. It featured poetry, an ingenious scheme for printing script backwards (to be read with the aid of a mirror), as well as plans for steering a hot air balloon, riot prevention, savings banks, and the construction of a single-wheel chaise, only the last of which was plainly intended as a joke. His subsequent works found the sort of esoteric meanings in text that would leave most modern literary scholars standing. <span class="italic">Andalusia, or, Notes tending to show that the yellow fever of the West Indies, and of Andalusia &hellip; was a disease well known to the ancients</span> (1805) used heavily annotated extracts from the classics to support his main contention&#151;that the ancients not only knew about yellow fever, but of a cure. He expatiated in <span class="italic">A Supplement</span>, published the following year, in which he offered supporting evidence in the shape of an interpretation of the hieroglyphic inscriptions on a mummy preserved at Cambridge. <span class="italic">A new view of the classics and ancient arts; tending to shew their invariable connexion with the sciences</span> (1806) took Homer's <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> as its main text, and discovered in it complex geographical allusions which indicated that its author possessed an intimate knowledge of world geography, including that of Japan and of the interior of Africa. Perhaps his most celebrated work was the six-volume <span class="italic">Discoveries in hieroglyphics, and other antiquities, in progress of which many compositions are put in a light entirely new</span> (1813). Herein, with the aid of copious notes, a multitude of classical allusions, and 196 engraved illustrations, he sought to prove that the characters, plots, and events described in several literary classics, including works by Shakespeare (among them <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="italic">Othello</span>, and <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>), Samuel Butler (<span class="italic">Hudibras</span>), Milton, and Homer, were nothing more than allusions to the phases of the moon. It was later claimed, doubtfully, that he attempted to have the book withdrawn from sale  (Watt, <span class="italic">Bibl. Brit.</span>). One correspondent to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> denominated it &#145;one of the most extraordinary works ever published&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 10, 236); another thought that &#145;the whole affair seems to afford indications of insanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2, 61). Heron, who spoke from personal experience, noted by way of elegy that Deverell &#145;wrote works which decidedly proved insanity, and his conduct was also, sometimes, such as to admit of no other excuse; yet, he was also the best tutor I could have had; for, with a private education, without companions of any ability, I was in need of his strange and active imagination to excite my reasoning faculties&#146;  (Heron, 263&#150;4).<br>
<br>Deverell certainly appears to have inhabited a strange parallel universe; perhaps unsurprisingly, he never married. He died on 29 November 1841 in New Norfolk Street, London, having directed that his sizeable personal estate be divided among the children of his niece Mary Couthard. A bequest of &pound;100 was paid to the Hon. Mrs Carpenter of Bowness, Westmorland.<br>
