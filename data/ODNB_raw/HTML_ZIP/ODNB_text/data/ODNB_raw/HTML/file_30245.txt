</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yorke,  Philip</span>, first earl of Hardwicke  (1690&#150;1764), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born at Dover, Kent, on 1 December 1690, the only surviving son of Philip Yorke (<i>bap</i>. 1651, <i>d</i>. 1721), an attorney of Dover, and his wife, Elizabeth (1658/9&#150;1727), the daughter of Richard Gibbon of Dover. He was educated at a school in Bethnal Green, Middlesex, run by a dissenter, Samuel Morland, but left at the age of sixteen to become an articled clerk to a prominent London attorney, Charles Salkeld of Holborn. Mrs Salkend was said to have exploited his dependent status by sending him on grocery errands, until the young man hit upon the deterrent stratagem of charging for coach hire. Charles Salkeld's perception of Yorke's talents soon launched him on the path to fame and fortune. Yorke, ambitious to be a barrister rather than a humble attorney, was entered at the Middle Temple in 1708 and about the same time he may have become tutor to the son of Lord Chief Justice Thomas Parker of king's bench.<br>
<br>These valuable connections imparted a rocket-like boost to his legal career after Yorke was called to the bar on 6 May 1715. He obtained numerous briefs from attorney friends on the western circuit and enjoyed the praise and tacit patronage of Judge Parker, first in the court of king's bench, and then, when Parker became Lord Chancellor Macclesfield in 1718, in the court of chancery. Yorke's legal connections were further enhanced by his marriage on 16 May 1719 to a widow, Margaret Lygon (<i>c</i>.1695&#150;1761), the daughter of the Worcestershire squire and former MP Charles Cocks, for she was niece of the late Lord Somers, a former lord chancellor, and niece by marriage to Sir Joseph Jekyll, master of the rolls. They had five sons and two daughters, all well taken care of by their father, whose initial poverty was doubtless the spur to his success in securing wealth for himself and his progeny. In 1725 he bought for &pound;24,000 the Gloucestershire estate of Hardwicke, where he never lived, and by the 1730s his avarice had won him the nickname Judge Gripus. In 1740 he was able to pay the earl of Oxford &pound;100,000 for the estate of Wimpole in Cambridgeshire. It became the Yorke family home and the basis of an electoral interest in that county, where his local influence was signified by his appointment in 1749 as high steward of Cambridge University.<h2>
<a name="Entryintopolitics"></a>Entry into politics</h2>Yorke's ability had also attracted the attention of the wealthy duke of Newcastle, a man of his own age, who brought him into parliament at a by-election on 21 April 1719 for his borough of Lewes. At the general election of 1722 Yorke transferred to another of Newcastle's boroughs, Seaford. So began a lifelong friendship, during which, while Newcastle was secretary of state for thirty years from 1724, and then first lord of the Treasury for nearly eight years, Yorke evolved from prot&eacute;g&eacute; to the duke's chief confidant. His maiden speech, on 4 March 1720 in a debate on what became the <span class="roman">Irish Declaratory Act</span> of that year, was his most important constitutional pronouncement in parliament. He argued that the inhabitants of Ireland were either the native Irish, a conquered people, or colonists from Britain. In either case they were subject to the British parliament. Later that month, when the post of solicitor-general fell vacant, Macclesfield secured it for Yorke, then aged twenty-nine and with less than five years at the bar, over the heads of more senior claimants. He was knighted on 11 June 1720 and promoted to attorney-general on 31 January 1724. His legal tasks soon included the successful prosecution of two notorious criminals, Jack Sheppard in 1724 and Jonathan Wild in 1725, and as attorney-general he enjoyed a profitable private practice at the bar. Yorke also did his parliamentary duty by what became the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole. Even the scanty records of the 1720s list him as speaking in every parliamentary session of the decade. He spoke on the South Sea Bubble and was prominent in pushing bills of attainder against Jacobites implicated in the 1722 plot. It was Yorke, too, who in 1723 moved for what became known as the <span class="roman">Waltham Black Act</span>. Embarrassment loomed in 1725 when his former patron Lord Macclesfield was accused of corruption. Yorke excused himself from the customary obligation of his office by taking no part in the impeachment proceedings, conduct which incurred criticism, and on 18 March he vainly sought mitigation of the punishment designed for the convicted and disgraced lord chancellor.<br>
<br>From 1727 onwards, when European war threatened, Yorke was foremost among those who supported in parliamentary debate such unpopular financial and military measures as increased army estimates and Hessian subsidy treaties. On 7 May 1728 he displayed a touch of steel when he took the opposition leader William Pulteney to task for describing as villains all MPs who supported a vote of credit, extracting an apology even before Speaker Onslow ruled the word to be unparliamentary. Attorney-General Yorke strongly backed Walpole over the unpopular <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> of 1733, making a long speech when it was introduced on 14 March. He challenged the opposition propaganda claim that there was a threat to individual liberty and to the constitution, which, he commented sarcastically, did not include customs frauds.<br>
<br>Later that year a coincidence of vacancies led to a reshuffle of legal posts. Yorke waived precedence to allow Solicitor-General Charles Talbot, whom he had leap-frogged into office in 1720, and who was his superior in equity law, to become lord chancellor. He himself became lord chief justice of king's bench, with a salary enhanced by &pound;2000, a peerage as Baron Hardwicke, and appointment to the privy council. His term as a common-law judge was not marked by any notable decisions, and ended unexpectedly when Lord Talbot died on 14 February 1737, at the age of fifty-one.<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor"></a>Lord chancellor</h2>Hardwicke, only five years younger, now claimed the honour he had seemingly forfeited. After a week of bargaining with Walpole, whereby his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30246/', "Philip Yorke (later second earl of Hardwicke)")</script>, was to obtain in 1738 a lucrative life sinecure at the exchequer, Hardwicke took the woolsack on 21 February 1737; he remained lord chancellor for more than nineteen years. It was a demanding multi-function post: Hardwicke was invariably named as one of the lords justices, or regents, during George II's visits to Hanover; he was a member of the cabinet; he acted as <i>de facto</i> speaker of the House of Lords; he was the chief law lord there, hearing appeals from courts in Scotland as well as England; and he presided over the court of chancery.<br>
<br>Legal historians credit Hardwicke with establishing finally the freedom of his office from bribery and undue influence: it was a mere dozen years since the conviction of Macclesfield. More positively, he became renowned for immense conscientiousness in his desire to do justice. Aware that equity law, which regulated personal and property rights, was said to come from books not brains, he established precedents as the mode of procedure&#151;often by the 1750s his own precedents. &#145;Certainty is the mother of repose, and therefore the law aims at certainty&#146; was his maxim  (Yorke, 2.423). To that end he mastered every aspect of law, notably learning Roman law to cope with Scottish cases. Nevertheless he was conscious that counsel might on particular points prove more erudite than himself, and he took due note of arguments advanced. &#145;His pen always moves at the right time&#146;, it was said. Hardwicke was never ashamed to alter his opinion, affirming &#145;I always thought it a much greater reproach to a Judge to continue in his error than to retract it&#146;  (Campbell, 5.46). Hardwicke was a well-mannered judge, never interrupting a legal pleading or indulging in sarcastic humour from the privilege of the bench. His rulings were so convincing in balance and erudition that even unsuccessful litigants were usually satisfied that justice had been done. &#145;When his Lordship pronounced his decrees&#146;, said Lord Mansfield, &#145;wisdom himself might be supposed to speak&#146;  (Yorke, 2.529). Hardwicke possessed the advantages of a handsome person, good looks, and a clear, sonorous voice, and his judgments became a public spectacle. &#145;Multitudes&#146;, Lord Camden recalled, &#145;would flock to hear Lord Hardwicke as to hear Garrick&#146;  (Campbell, 5.361). The quality of his decisions greatly increased chancery business, and he enjoys the reputation of being the creator of modern equity law.<br>
<br>Hardwicke was a more active politician, both in Lords debates and at the heart of cabinet decision making, than most other lord chancellors. In a conversation with Attorney-General Sir Dudley Ryder in 1739, Walpole apparently envisaged him as his successor: &#145;Lord Hardwicke was one of the greatest men this nation ever bred, and if he himself should drop or quit, the public affairs must fall into his hands, though he seemed very unwilling to accept them&#146;. A year later Walpole sounded Hardwicke directly, and the lord chancellor made it quite clear that he had no wish &#145;to bear the fatigue&#146; of being prime minister  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1715&#150;54</span>, 2.570). The political role Hardwicke chose for himself was rather that of one of the close inner circle of advisers during the ministries of Henry Pelham and his brother the duke of Newcastle. Twenty years later the courtier Lord Waldegrave wrote that, &#145;without affecting the name, or parade, of a Minister, Lord Hardwicke also had great weight and authority: he &hellip; was consulted on every occasion; and no important measure of government was carried into execution, without his previous consent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 154).<br>
<br>The diarist Horace Walpole sought to blacken Hardwicke's reputation for posterity in the belief that he deserted his father as his ministry fell. The parliamentary record demonstrates the contrary. The lord chancellor, unlike the Commons speaker, could take part in debate, leaving his seat on the woolsack to do so. Hardwicke was a better debater in the Lords than in the Commons, where his legalistic style had not always gone down well. Newcastle acknowledged his role in supporting the ministry's effort to avoid a Spanish war in 1739. In February 1741 Hardwicke spoke strongly against the motion by the opposition leader Carteret for Walpole's dismissal; and after Walpole's resignation in February 1742 the lord chancellor was instrumental in procuring the Lords' defeat of a bill designed to give immunity for witnesses against the fallen minister, denouncing the idea as unfair.<br>
<br>Walpole's reluctance to prosecute the war against Spain, and in effect France also from 1740, had nevertheless distanced him from his colleagues. When he resigned alone, it made sense for Newcastle and Hardwicke to negotiate a coalition ministry headed by Carteret as the man to run the war. Two years later, against the king's wishes, Carteret was forced to resign by the threat of parliamentary defeat, in November 1744. Hardwicke played an important role in this coup. It was he who, at the request of the Pelham brothers, drafted the memorial presented to George II on 1 November that indicted the failure of Carteret's foreign policy. Although Carteret's fall had been cleverly contrived, Hardwicke blandly disclaimed responsibility, telling George II that, by the constitution, &#145;your ministers, Sir, are only your instruments of government&#146;. The king made the famous retort &#145;Ministers are the Kings in this country&#146;  (Yorke, 1.383). The confrontation of February 1746, when the cabinet ministers tendered their resignations to coerce George II into acceptance of their demands, served to confirm the current political reality, that there was nowhere else for the king to turn. For the decade from 1744 Hardwicke formed with Newcastle and Henry Pelham, who had taken the Treasury in 1743, a triumvirate that controlled the British political scene. Often the lord chancellor was called upon to arbitrate between the two brothers, the duke seeking his support against the power Pelham wielded as leader in the Commons. By 1747 Pelham was clearly &#145;the premier&#146;, as the other two both acknowledged, but he was often overruled by his colleagues, as on the continuation of the war until 1748 and Newcastle's expensive foreign policy thereafter.<br>
<br>Hardwicke was at the same time following his own personal agenda, to win favour with his sovereign. He did so notably by a speech in 1743 in the House of Lords defending the British hire of Hanoverian soldiers without prior parliamentary approval; he pointed out how ludicrous would have been a formal treaty of the king with himself as elector of Hanover, and lauded the value of the Hanoverian contribution to the war effort. George II doubtless also appreciated the hard line Hardwicke again, as in 1722, took against Jacobites. When invasion threatened in 1744 he insisted on strengthening a clause for forfeiture of estates as the penalty in a <span class="roman">Treason Bill</span> for any who corresponded with the exiled house of Stuart. After the rising of 1745 had been defeated, Hardwicke presided as lord high steward at the trial of Jacobite peers, dispensing a justice seldom tempered by mercy: some thought his severity in decreeing death sentences comparable to the &#145;butchery&#146; of Cumberland on the battlefield. The evidence the trials revealed about the rising caused Hardwicke to insist on punitive and preventative legislation for Scotland. He drafted and pushed through the <span class="roman">Hereditable Jurisdictions Act</span> of 1747, abolishing the legal powers of the clan chiefs which had enabled them to raise their men. But the other professed object of lawyer Hardwicke was to provide for Scotland a fairer and less arbitrary system of justice. Further legislation in 1748 banned highland dress, the wearing of the kilt, and the ancient right of clansmen to bear arms, prohibitions widely resented in Scotland as breaches of national tradition.<br>
<br>Hardwicke's office gave him a distinctive and active role throughout the Pelham ministry. As lord chancellor he was personally involved in the negotiations in 1745 with tories about the new county commissions of the peace they were demanding as the price of their support: a few were issued, without a ban on tories for the first time since 1714, as evidence of the ministry's good faith, before that political rapprochement ended. Hardwicke's position as lord chancellor always gave weight to his advice to his sovereign and colleagues on constitutional matters and to his parliamentary opinions on legislation. When the prince of Wales died in 1751 it was Hardwicke who proposed that his widow be named prospective regent for her young son, and not the king's preferred choice, his second son, the duke of Cumberland, since the duke was highly unpopular: the Pelham brothers and even George II accepted this advice. In that same year Hardwicke gave essential support to the opposition peer Lord Chesterfield's reform of the calendar, even though Newcastle disliked the innovation. In 1753 Hardwicke strongly backed a <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Act</span>, but he accepted its repeal the following year because of the popular outcry. &#145;However much the people may be misled, yet in a free country I do not think an unpopular measure ought to be obstinately persisted in&#146;, he was reported to have told the House of Lords  (Campbell, 5.124). 1753 also saw the passage of what became known as Lord Hardwicke's <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span>, designed to prevent clandestine marriages, a matter of particular concern to the propertied classes. At the time neither prior notice nor parental consent for minors was required for marriage. Hardwicke's measure remedied this situation for England and Wales by ordering banns to be read for three Sundays in the designated church; insisting on previous consent of parents or guardians in the case of minors; and directing that the ceremony be conducted by an Anglican clergyman, a ground of complaint by dissenters and Roman Catholics: Jews and Quakers were exempted. Hardwicke's immense contribution to the English legal system by his judicial decisions was complemented by important legislation.<h2>
<a name="Politician17541764"></a>Politician, 1754&#150;1764</h2>Political tranquillity ended with the sudden death of Henry Pelham on 6 March 1754. Hardwicke managed affairs during the days of Newcastle's grief, and now more than ever became the duke's prop: &#145;My Lord Chancellor, with whom I do everything, and without whom I do nothing&#146;&#151;so did Newcastle write to William Pitt on 2 April  (Campbell, 5.137). The Newcastle ministry of 1754&#150;6 was a time when the duke needed a shoulder on which to lean. He could succeed his brother at the Treasury, but management of the House of Commons was a problem not solved for long, and one rendered impossible by the disasters that marked the beginning of the Seven Years' War in 1756. Pitt's hour had arrived, to be the saviour of his country, but he would not agree to take office in partnership with Newcastle. It was at an interview with Hardwicke in October 1756 that he made this clear. On 19 November the lord chancellor followed his friend out of office, &#145;much to the regret of all good men, and indeed of the Nation in general&#146;, wrote Lord Waldegrave:<blockquote>He had been Chancellor near twenty years, and was inferior to few who had gone before him, having executed that high office with Integrity, Diligence, and uncommon Abilities. The Statesman might be no wise equal to the Judge, yet even in that capacity, he had been the chief support of the Duke of Newcastle's Administration. (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 185)</blockquote>Hardwicke had warned Pitt that he would not be able to maintain a ministry without Newcastle's parliamentary strength, and so it proved. Pitt had no defence against royal antipathy, and was dismissed by George II in April 1757. The long and complicated discussions to construct a ministry in which Pitt would conduct the war and Newcastle manage parliament were finally concluded by Hardwicke, &#145;a proper person to negotiate&#146;, thought Lord Waldegrave, &#145;having great influence over the Duke of Newcastle, as well as some credit with Pitt, without being disagreeable to the King himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 207). Hardwicke took care to ensure the return of his son-in-law Lord Anson to the Admiralty, but sacrificed the seniority claim of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30237/', "Charles Yorke")</script> to be attorney-general to that of Pitt's candidate, Charles Pratt. He himself had no wish to be lord chancellor again, and that post was not filled, the work being done by Sir Robert Henley as lord keeper of the great seal. Although without office, Hardwicke attended cabinet at the request of Newcastle.<br>
<br>When George II died in 1760 Hardwicke thought of retiring from politics and, alone of the duke's friends, suggested to Newcastle that he should resign the Treasury and do the same&#151;unwelcome advice for a man to whom politics was the stuff of life. The duke retained his office, only to find his influence passing to Lord Bute, favourite of the new king George III. When he complained to Hardwicke, his old friend made the unhelpful reply on 8 August 1761 that he should have retired at the change of sovereign. Hardwicke, though he refused various offers from the new king, continued to attend cabinet to support Newcastle. Both sided in the majority against Pitt when in October 1761 he made a Spanish war a resigning issue. Early in 1762 Hardwicke supported Newcastle's intention to continue a subsidy to Britain's ally Prussia. When the cabinet decided otherwise Newcastle resigned the Treasury on 7 May 1762, and Hardwicke was no longer summoned to attend cabinet.<br>
<br>Fearing for the careers of his sons if they were obliged to go into opposition, Hardwicke vainly renewed his pressure on the duke to retire, and was widely thought to have done so himself. By autumn 1762 Newcastle had decided to oppose the peace terms negotiated by the Bute ministry. That was contrary to the advice of Hardwicke, who nevertheless then himself attacked the peace in the Lords debate of 9 December, criticizing the restoration of Cuba and the French sugar islands. Realizing they now faced the prospect of permanent opposition, the still loyal Hardwicke made the wry comment to Newcastle that it was &#145;a kind of new trade to learn at a late hour&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32948, fols. 1&#150;2). There was not much else to oppose during that parliamentary session, but Hardwicke did make what proved to be his last speech, on 28 March 1763 against a proposed cider tax, unfairly portraying it as a second land tax on the cider counties of western England.<br>
<br>After George Grenville succeeded Bute as prime minister in April 1763 George III was not satisfied with his new ministry. Contrary to the advice of his cabinet, he insisted in June on Hardwicke being offered the then vacant cabinet post of lord president of the council. Hardwicke refused. The diarist Mrs Grenville noted that he said &#145;they would never come into office, but as a party and upon a plan concerted with Mr Pitt and the great Whig Lords, as had been practised in the late King's time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 2.191). When the next month George III negotiated with Pitt for a new ministry, Pitt himself took a similar line, naming Hardwicke for the same post and Newcastle as lord privy seal. The king deemed his proposals unacceptable, and retained the Grenville ministry. The clear divide between administration and opposition that now became evident led Charles Yorke to resign the post of attorney-general he had retained under Bute and Grenville, and the younger Yorkes joined their father in opposition. But Hardwicke's political career was now over. He had always taken care of his health, by diet and exercise, and was said by his son Charles to look fifty when he was seventy. But from September 1763 what Newcastle described in December as &#145;a most painful and dangerous disease&#146;  (Yorke, 3.483) confined him to bed at his London home of Powis House, Great Ormond Street, until his death on 6 March 1764. He was buried at Wimpole parish church on 25 March.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>&#145;Men are apt to mistake, or at least seem to mistake, their own talents&#146;, wrote Lord Chesterfield. &#145;Thus Lord Hardwicke valued himself more on being a great minister of state, which he certainly was not, than on being a great magistrate, which he certainly was&#146;  (Campbell, 5.65). Chesterfield thought Hardwicke's &#145;timidity&#146; as a politician outweighed &#145;his parts&#146;, and he never held responsible office. But historians have added perception of his key role in the Pelham and Newcastle ministries to appreciation of his stature as one of Britain's greatest lawyers. Doubtless as gratifying to Hardwicke as his personal success was the creation of a new wealthy and influential aristocratic dynasty. On 2 April 1754 he acquired the further titles earl of Hardwicke and Viscount Royston; the latter was enjoyed as a courtesy by his eldest son, Philip. Already possessing a lucrative exchequer tellership, Philip was married at the age of twenty to a rich heiress, Lady Jemima Campbell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68351/', "Yorke, Jemima")</script>] who within a fortnight became Marchioness Grey in her own right. The second son, Charles, guided by his father to success as a lawyer and politician, obtained a chancery sinecure in 1747. This he shared with his brother John, the fourth son, until in 1750 his father obtained another chancery sinecure for John. Hardwicke's application for this provoked the comment from George II that &#145;My Lord Chancellor is getting every office that falls in the law for his own children&#146;  (Yorke, 2.179). The third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30243/', "Joseph Yorke (later Baron Dover)")</script>, enjoyed rapid promotion in his chosen army career; he became a lieutenant-colonel at the age of twenty before turning to diplomacy and beginning a thirty-year spell as British minister at The Hague from 1751. All four were soon MPs, Philip for Cambridgeshire from 1747. The fifth son, James, was from 1774 successively bishop of St David's, Gloucester, and Ely. Hardwicke's elder daughter, Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68350/', "Anson, Elizabeth, Lady Anson (1725&#150;1760)")</script>], married in 1748 the famous Admiral Lord Anson, who as first lord of the Admiralty sat in cabinet with his father-in-law from 1751. His younger daughter, Margaret, in 1749 married Sir Gilbert Heathcote, an extremely wealthy baronet. Hardwicke would have loved Horace Walpole's comment on the Yorkes in 1757: &#145;The family is very powerful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 4.91).<br>
<br>As a man Hardwicke commanded admiration rather than affection. There was no lighter side to his character. In later life he stated that he had been too busy in his youth to be a rake. There is no record of any recreations that he enjoyed, and unlike most lord chancellors of the age he failed to use his clerical patronage to assist men of letters. He left no legacy of anecdotes about himself, or of <i>bons mots</i> attributed to him. While his youthful persona was as a man of single-minded ambition, in maturity his image became one of self-importance, even pomposity. Lord Waldegrave commented on &#145;his usual gravity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 178). His correspondence shows that he was so conscious of his new aristocratic status that his letters to his eldest son were after 1754 addressed to &#145;My Dear Lord&#146;. Of his integrity of character there can be no doubt. Despite his notorious desire for money he was never suspected of corruption, and he was a model of sobriety and connubial fidelity. Yet he was not quite a gentleman, in the opinion of Lord Waldegrave: &#145;He was undoubtedly an excellent Chancellor, and might have been thought a great man, had he been less avaricious, less proud, less unlike a Gentleman, and not so great a politician&#146;  (ibid., 154n.).<br>
