<span class="headword">Diss,  Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1403/4), <span class="occ">prior of Norwich and theologian</span>, as his name indicates, came from Diss in Norfolk. When he was ordained deacon at Ely, on 16 February 1353, he had already entered the Carmelite house in Norwich, and was appointed its prior in 1376. According to Leland he studied at Paris and Rome, but it is known for certain only that he was in the Cambridge house and became DTh there. By the 1370s Diss had already established himself as a scholar with a considerable reputation as a preacher. Bale credits him with several theological and philosophical works&#151;<span class="italic">Ex Augustino et Anselmo</span>, <span class="italic">Lectura theologiae</span>, <span class="italic">Quaestiones theologiae</span>, and <span class="italic">Determinationes variae</span>&#151;and he is said to have published a commentary on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and two volumes of sermons. He also wrote a tract <span class="italic">Contra Lolhardos</span>, and seems to have been one of the compilers of the material that eventually appeared as the <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span>. The great schism stimulated a number of writings: <span class="italic">Epistolae ad Urbanum et Bonifacium</span>, <span class="italic">Ad ecclesiarum praesides</span>, and a poem, <span class="italic">Carmen de schismate ecclesiae</span>, of which some fragments were printed in the works of Nicholas de Clemangiis  (<span class="italic">Opera</span>, 31&#150;4). He always strongly supported the English government in its recognition of the Roman papacy against that of Avignon.<br>
<br>Diss was appointed confessor to Edward III's son John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1399), and his duchess, Constanza of Castile (<i>d</i>. 1394), in succession to William Badby, another Carmelite, and was instrumental in encouraging the duke's piety and his veneration for the Virgin Mary. On 12 January 1375 Gaunt granted <i>nostre confessour</i> Walter Diss an annual payment of &pound;10 while he remained in the duke's service (this annuity was doubled in 1380) to be drawn from the income of Gaunt's Norfolk manor of Gimingham, and a further payment was made on 12 October for administering mass at the Garter ceremony. Gaunt's register records similar payments regularly until the spring of 1382, and shows that Diss normally travelled with the duke. He was also a beneficiary in 1379 under the terms of the will of the Lancastrian retainer Sir Roger Trumpington. When Gaunt was obliged to sort out the complex case of the Lathom inheritance in Lancashire, in which one of the issues was the legality of the marriage of another retainer, Sir John Dalton, it was Diss who remarried the couple after the pope had sanctioned a divorce. Diss was replaced as confessor by yet another Carmelite, John Kenningham of Ipswich, in 1386, but remained closely connected with Gaunt.<br>
<br>Diss was one of the group of friars who appealed to Gaunt on 18 February 1382 and persuaded him that it was dangerous for him to continue to support John Wyclif, and when Archbishop Courtenay summoned a council to the London Blackfriars in May of that year to condemn Wyclif's teachings, Diss was an obvious choice to be one of the distinguished panel of judges, and represented the University of Cambridge. He was subsequently a member of the smaller group that assembled to continue the process against Nicholas Hereford and Philip Repyndon in June and July.<br>
<br>In the years that followed, Diss's fortunes continued to be linked with those of his patron. Prominent among the factors shaping English foreign policy in the 1380s were the competition of Rome and Avignon for the spiritual loyalties of western Europe, and the ambition of John of Gaunt to be king of Castile in the right of his wife, at the expense of Juan I, who was supported by both the French monarchy and the Avignon papacy. Diss was one of a group of papal nuncios for England, Gascony, and the Spanish kingdoms empowered by Urban VI in 1386 to raise money by the sale of indulgences and authorized to award fifty papal chaplaincies&#151;an act that considerably irritated the chronicler Thomas Walsingham, a long-standing adversary of Gaunt, who lamented that even the Benedictines of St Albans were being seduced by this opportunity to secure honour and preferment. Gaunt eventually led an army to Galicia in July 1386 in alliance with Jo&atilde;o of Portugal, but the campaign had virtually petered out by May 1387, although it took until the summer of the following year to arrange a general truce. Although he was appointed Carmelite prior provincial for Spain in 1387, there is no evidence that Diss accompanied the expedition. Walsingham suggests that he was detained in England by the scandal caused by the grant of one of the chaplaincies to the Lollard Peter Pateshull, a dubious story, although Diss may well have been involved in dealings with this renegade friar during 1387&#150;8. He subsequently remained in contact with Gaunt, whom he is known to have visited in 1396, but he seems to have spent most of the last decade of his life in quiet retirement in Norwich, where he died in 1404 or possibly towards the end of the previous year.<br>
