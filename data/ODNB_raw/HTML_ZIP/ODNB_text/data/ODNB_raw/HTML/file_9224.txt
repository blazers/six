<span class="headword">Fawcett,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1867), <span class="occ">composer and choirmaster</span>, was born in the village of Wennington in Lancashire on 8 December 1789. He followed his father's trade of shoemaking until 1825, but also pursued a keen interest in music. He was self-taught, and began his studies by copying out, and even writing from memory, the scores and parts of the hymn tunes practised in the village choir. At the age of twelve he joined a singing class and learned the Lancashire sol-fa system of singing. He also joined the militia band, in which he played the clarinet, and of which he became bandmaster at seventeen. In this role he composed marches and quicksteps, but the bent of his mind led him to the writing of hymn tunes, and soon his services as a choirmaster were eagerly sought, and Fawcett was employed in this capacity successively at the St George's, the Wesleyan, and the Independent chapels at Kendal, and the Holland Wesleyan Sunday school at Farnworth, Lancashire, between 1817 and 1825. In 1825 he moved to Bolton as the choirmaster of the Bridge Street Wesleyan and the Mawdesley Street Congregational chapels there and, relinquishing at last the business of bootmaking, he devoted himself exclusively to the teaching and composition of music. He taught the piano, organ, harmonium, flute, violin, cello, double bass, singing, and composition, besides establishing musical meetings at his own house, organizing concerts of local talent, and occasionally assisting, in conjunction with London and Lancashire professionals, at small festivals in the neighbourhood. He upheld the Lancashire system of notation with some obstinacy, a quality further illustrated in the close of his interesting address, &#145;Choirs and choir music&#146;, prefixed to the <span class="italic">Voice of Devotion</span> (1862), a collection of 400 popular and original hymn tunes selected and revised by Fawcett.<br>
<br>Fawcett himself composed over 2000 psalm and hymn tunes, most of which were published in collections. Three sets of psalm and hymn tunes were published by him under the titles of <span class="italic">The Harp of Zion</span>, <span class="italic">The Cherub Lute</span>, and <span class="italic">Miriam's Timbrel</span> (1862). In Lancashire these were popular. In 1840 he collaborated with Joseph Hart in the compilation of an anthology, <span class="italic">Melodia divina</span>. Fawcett died at his home in Haworth Street, Bolton, on 26 October 1867, leaving three sons and seven daughters, his wife having predeceased him. He was buried in Bolton cemetery five days later. Two of his sons, Thomas and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9223/', "John Fawcett (1824/5&#150;1857)")</script>, also became musicians.<br>
