<span class="headword">Coleridge,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1719, <em>d.</em> 1781), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster</span>, was baptized on 21 January 1719 at Crediton, Devon, the son of John Coleridge (1697&#150;1739), a weaver, and his wife, Mary Wills (1698&#150;1776). Having become a respectable draper in Crediton, John Coleridge senior went bankrupt when his son John was fifteen. According to family legend the boy, a promising scholar at the grammar school at Crediton, left school and walked off to seek his fortune; he was found weeping by the roadside by a gentleman who got him a job as an usher at a nearby school.<br>
<br>On 24 May 1743 Coleridge married Mary Lendon (<i>d</i>. 1751?), of Crediton; they had four daughters, three of whom survived infancy. From 1745 to 1748 he was a schoolmaster at Clysthydon, Devon. In 1747, at the age of twenty-eight, he took the unusual step for a married man of matriculating at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He became a distinguished classical and Hebrew scholar, and might have had a fellowship if he had been single. He returned to Devon in 1749, before becoming a teacher at Squire's Grammar School in South Molton and a curate at Mariansleigh.<br>
<br>Mary Coleridge having died, probably in 1751, John Coleridge married, on 18 December 1753, Ann Bowden (1727&#150;1809), daughter of Roger Bowden and Mary Zeatherd, in St Mary Arches Church in Exeter. Ann's background was as humble as her husband's. &#145;The Bowdens inherited a house-stye &amp; a pig-stye in the Exmore County, in the reign of Elizabeth&#146;, according to their son Samuel, and &#145;they have inherited nothing better since that time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 1.302). This second marriage produced ten children, nine of whom survived infancy. The eight sons took up a variety of professions, mostly with great success; one joined the army, one the navy, three the church, and another became a doctor. The last, the child of his father's old age, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772&#150;1834)")</script>, poet, who was born on 21 October 1772.<br>
<br>In 1760 Coleridge was appointed headmaster of the King's School at Ottery St Mary and vicar of Ottery St Mary church, the largest and most important parish church in Devon. He published articles on biblical scholarship in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and helped Dr Benjamin Kennicott with his edition of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He also printed some idiosyncratic scholarly works, mainly by subscription raised among local worthies and admirers: <span class="italic">Miscellaneous dissertations, arising from the XVIIth and XVIIIth chapters of the book of Judges</span> (1768), <span class="italic">A critical Latin grammar: containing clear and distinct rules for boys just initiated, and notes explanatory of almost every antiquity and obscurity in the language, for youth somewhat advanced in Latin learning</span> (1772), and a sermon declaring that America's success in the American War of Independence was God's punishment of British sinfulness, <span class="italic">Government not originally proceeding from human agency, but divine institution, shewn in a sermon preached at Ottery St Mary, Devon, December 13th 1776, on the fast-day, appointed by reason of our much to be lamented American War</span> (1777). Samuel Taylor Coleridge declared that his father's works went largely unnoticed and unread. His reputation seems not to have spread much beyond Devon, where he was admired for his scholarship&#151;his <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Dissertations</span> lists over 300 subscribers&#151;and his Sunday sermons.<br>
<br>Coleridge died suddenly, probably of apoplexy, at the age of sixty-two, in the early morning of 6 October 1781, only hours after returning home to the School House at Ottery from Plymouth, where he had enlisted his second youngest son, Francis, as a midshipman. He was buried on 10 October in the chancel of Ottery St Mary church. His death had severe consequences for his precocious youngest son, who on losing his father also lost his home and was sent the following year, aged nine, to London as a boarder at Christ's Hospital school.<br>
<br>Coleridge was, by all accounts, including that of Samuel, who relished comparisons between himself and his beloved father, an original&#151;an absent-minded scholar, bookish, enthusiastic, careless of his appearance, &#145;an Israelite without guile&#146;, &#145;a perfect Parson Adams&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 1.310, 355), of whom it was told that he once mistook the apron of his female neighbour at dinner for his own shirt, stuffing it into his trousers, and on another occasion appeared before his bishop with a shaven head, having forgotten to put on his wig  (Gillman, 3&#150;4, 5).<br>
