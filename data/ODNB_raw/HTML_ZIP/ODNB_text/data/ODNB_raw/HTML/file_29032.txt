</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Welwitsch,  Friedrich Martin Josef</span>  (1806&#150;1872), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Maria-Saal, near Klagenfurt, Carinthia, Austria, on 5 February 1806, to a large family of a prosperous farmer and surveyor. While at school he was encouraged by his father in the study of botany, and when sent to the University of Vienna with a view to the legal profession, he was so devoted to the study of natural history as to make no progress in the study of the law. His father thereupon withdrew his allowance, but Welwitsch transferred to the medical faculty of the university, continued with his botanical studies, and supported himself by writing critiques of theatrical productions. In 1834 he gained a prize, offered by the mayor of Vienna, for his &#145;Beitr&auml;ge zur cryptogamischen Flora Unter-Oesterreichs&#146;, and his appointment about the same time to report on the cholera in Carinthia reconciled his father to his new profession. After travelling as tutor to a nobleman, he returned to Vienna, and graduated MD in 1836, his thesis being published in that year as <span class="italic">Synopsis Nostochinearum Austri&aelig; inferioris</span>.<br>
<br>Welwitsch spent much of his time in the botanical museum at Vienna, and became intimate with Fenzl and other botanists. In 1839, &#145;an act of youthful indiscretion on his part, in the course of enjoying too freely the gaieties of Vienna, rendered it expedient for him to leave Austria&#146;  (Hiern, 1.xvii) and he accepted a commission from the Unio Itineraria of W&uuml;rttemberg to collect the plants of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands. With this object he travelled to England, from where he sailed to Lisbon, arriving in July 1839. He learned Portuguese in six weeks, and, becoming attached to Portugal, he did not leave that country until 1853, except for short visits to Paris and London. During these years he had charge of the botanical gardens at Lisbon and Coimbra, and of those of the duke of Palmela at Cintra, Alemtejo, and elsewhere. He was also engaged as demonstrator and curator at the Lisbon Polytechnic. He explored most of Portugal, forming a herbarium of nine thousand species fully represented by specimens in all stages of growth, with descriptive notes and synonymy; he sent eleven thousand specimens to the Unio Itineraria and deposited sets with the academies of Lisbon and Paris. In 1841 Welwitsch had a three days' excursion to the Valle de Zebro with Robert Brown (1773&#150;1858), and in 1847 and 1848, with Count Descayrac, he explored the southern province of Algarve, then little known to botanists. Between 1847 and 1852 he added 250 species of the larger fungi from the neighbourhood of Lisbon to those enumerated in Brotero's <span class="italic">Flora</span>, while in his zeal for algae (of which in 1850 he published a list in the second volume of the <span class="italic">Actas</span> of the Lisbon Academy) he spent hours day after day up to his waist in water. In 1851 he sent twelve thousand specimens of flowering plants and six thousand cryptogams to England for sale; the fungi and mosses collected by him were described by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Mr Mitten in <span class="italic">Some Notes upon the Cryptogamic &hellip; Plants Collected in Portugal, 1842&#150;50</span> (1853). He also studied and collected molluscs and insects, especially Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, and in 1844 was one of the founders of the Horticultural Society of Lisbon.<br>
<br>In 1851 Welwitsch was engaged to prepare the Portuguese collections for the Great Exhibition, and accompanied them to London, where he sought the advice of Robert Brown and others as to the exploration of Portuguese West Africa, for which he had been chosen by the government of his adopted country. He started from Lisbon on this seven years' journey on 8 August 1853, visited Madeira, the Cape Verde Islands and Freetown, Sierra Leone (where he spent nine days in making his first acquaintance with tropical vegetation), and reached Luanda on 30 September. Nearly a year was devoted to the exploration of the coast zone from the mouth of the Quizembo, lat. 8&deg;15' S, to that of the Cuanza, lat. 9&deg;20' S. He had been given &pound;270 for his scientific equipment and voyage, and was paid &pound;45 a month, but finding that bearers and other expenses of his fieldwork far exceeded this allowance, he sent large collections of insects, seeds, living plants, and dried specimens to England for sale. In September 1854 he ascended the River Bengo to Sange in Golungo Alto, 125 miles from the coast, where he met David Livingstone, living with him some time, and remaining in this district of dense jungle in all for about two years, during which he suffered much from fever, scurvy, and ulcerated legs. In 1856 he travelled south-westward to Pungo Andongo in the Presidio das Pedras Nigras. After eight months' exploration from this centre he returned to Luanda, having in the course of three years explored a triangular area with 120 miles of coast as its base, and its apex at Quisonde on the Cuanza, and collected over 3200 species of plants.<br>
<br>Welwitsch drew up a summary of his geographical and botanical findings under the title of &#145;Apontamentos phyto-geographicos sobre a flora da provincia de Angola&#146;, which was published at Lisbon in 1859 in the <span class="italic">Annaes do Conselho Ultramarino</span>. In this work he divided Angola into three botanical regions: the coast, up to an altitude of 1000 feet, the mountain woodland, from 1000 to 2500 feet; and the highland, above 2500 feet. In September 1858 he took a trip to Libongo, to the north of Luanda, and in June 1859 went to Benguela and thence by sea to Mossamedes. There the subtropical climate did much to reinvigorate him, and he found a flora near the coast more like that of Cape Colony, though only a mile inland it was more purely tropical. As he approached Cape Negro (in lat. 15&deg;40' S) the coast rose as a plateau of tufaceous limestone, covered with sandstone shingle, 300 or 400 feet high and 6 miles across, and it was there that Welwitsch discovered that remarkable plant which he named <i>Tumboa</i>, but which J. D. Hooker later renamed <i>Welwitschia</i> in his honour. This unique plant is made up of an enormous underground stem, and a pair of strap-shaped leaves that lie along the ground. Welwitsch was so amazed by his discovery &#145;that he could do nothing but kneel down on the burning soil and gaze at it, half in fear lest a touch should prove it a figment of the imagination&#146;  (Hiern, 1.xiii).<br>
<br>Welwitsch collected more than two thousand specimens in Benguela, but a tribal rebellion stopped his work; fifteen thousand Munanos attacked the colony of Lopollo in Huila, where he then was, and blockaded it for two months. After this Welwitsch, wounded and in bad health, returned to Mossamedes and Luanda, and from there in January 1861, he sailed to Lisbon, taking with him what was undoubtedly the best and most extensive herbarium ever collected in tropical Africa  (Hiern, 1.xiv). He was placed on Portuguese government committees for the improvement of cotton cultivation in Angola and for collecting the products of Portuguese colonies for the London International Exhibition of 1862, in connection with which he published one of his more important independent works, <span class="italic">Synopse explicativa de madeiras e drogas medicinaes</span> (1862). In November 1861 his patron King Dom Pedro V died, leaving Welwitsch at the mercy of the Portuguese bureaucracy. Finding it necessary to compare his specimens, a very large proportion of which were new to science, with those in English collections, he obtained permission from the Portuguese government in 1863 to take his collections, which are estimated to have comprised five thousand species of plants and three thousand species of insects, to England. He arrived in London on 20 October 1863, and devoted the remaining nine years of his life to the task of studying and arranging his collections. In connection with this work he maintained an extensive correspondence with many of the leading specialists among the naturalists of Europe, and received honourable recognition from many learned societies. However, the Portuguese government became impatient with his rate of progress, and ultimately, in February 1866, suspended his salary of &pound;2 a day. Welwitsch worked on in London, paying out of his own means the expenses of various publications which he had begun, the most important of which was his &#145;Sertum Angolense&#146; (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span>, 27, 1869, 1&#150;94), which cost him &pound;130.<br>
<br>Poverty eventually forced him to consider returning to Portugal, but he had insufficient funds for the voyage. His health deteriorated further, and he died on 20 October 1872 at his home at 15 Fitzroy Street, London, and was buried on 24 October in Kensal Green cemetery, where he is described on his tomb as &#145;Botanicus eximius, florae Angolensis investigatorum princeps&#146;. By his will, dated three days before his death, Welwitsch directed that the study set of his African plants should be offered to the British Museum (whose natural history departments were soon to be accommodated separately in the Natural History Museum, South Kensington), for purchase. The Portuguese government, however, claimed the whole of the collections, a claim which was resisted by the executors. The resulting chancery suit, the <i>King of Portugal v. Carruthers and Justen</i>, was eventually settled, the study set being returned to Lisbon, and the museum receiving the next best set with a copy of the explanatory notes and descriptions made by Welwitsch. A highly regarded catalogue of the collection, edited by William Philip Hiern (2 vols., 1896&#150;1901), contains an engraved portrait, biography, and full bibliography not only of Welwitsch's own work, but also of that of others relating to his collections.<br>
<br>Although Welwitsch's achievements in economic botany disappointed his Portuguese employers, and as a man he could be &#145;difficult &hellip; impatient, and tactless&#146;  (Swinscow, 278&#150;9), his collections &#145;far exceeded in number, quality and documentation any made before then in tropical Africa and remain a valuable source of information&#146;  (Stearn, 101).<br>
<br>Of Welwitsch's many papers the more important were the &#145;Apontamentos&#146;, the <span class="italic">Synopsis nostochienearum</span>, the <span class="italic">Synopse explicativa</span>, and the &#145;Sertum Angolense&#146; already referred to. His most important other work concerned the cultivation of cotton in Angola, and a translation by A. R. Saraiva was published in London in 1862.<br>
