<span class="headword">Sutton,  Katherine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1376), <span class="occ">abbess of Barking and supposed liturgical dramatist</span>, owes her importance solely to a tantalizing reference in the Barking customary drawn up by Sibille Felton, abbess from 1394 to 1419, and presented to the abbey in 1404:<blockquote>the venerable lady Katherine de Sutton, who then had pastoral charge [of the abbey,] &hellip; with the unanimous consent of the sisters, ordained that, immediately after the third responsory of Matins on Easter day, the celebration of the Lord's Resurrection would take place, and that the procession would be established [ordered?] in this manner. (Tolhurst, 107)</blockquote>There then follows an unusual piece of Latin liturgical drama, depicting the harrowing of hell, in which the nuns, representing the souls of the patriarchs in limbo, are led out of a side chapel by the officiating priest. Each carrying a palm and a candle, they go in triumphant procession to a side-altar, the &#145;sepulchre&#146;. Here a crucifix-figure and a communion-host, concealed on Good Friday to represent the burial of Christ, are now &#145;raised&#146;, and the host carried in a monstrance to the main altar of the Holy Trinity, with appropriate liturgical antiphons being sung at each stage. Not only is this piece of drama an unusual variant of the <i>elevatio</i>, the symbolic raising of Christ's body on Easter morning which was a standard part of medieval church practice, but it affords a rare glimpse of a female, non-clerical experience of liturgy. On both counts the Barking &#145;Harrowing of Hell&#146; has attracted much interest and Katherine Sutton has been hailed as the first known female dramatist in England. While this may be correct, the evidence is not conclusive and needs careful scrutiny.<br>
<br>Almost nothing is known about Katherine. The only other documents concerning her, the royal assent to her election as abbess on 15 March 1358, and the royal leave (date 16 April 1376) to elect a new abbess on her death, do not give her parentage, as such documents often do, nor is there any indication of her date of birth or date of profession as a nun. The lack of information about Katherine Sutton is therefore unusual for the head of an abbey of such powerful standing as Barking, which claimed to be the oldest community of women in England (after the destruction of other communities by the Danes), ranked as a royal foundation. Its abbess took precedence over other abbesses and was considered to hold her lands by barony. Despite impoverishment caused by repeated flooding of its lands along the Thames, at the dissolution Barking was found to be the third richest abbey of nuns in England.<br>
<br>Since many abbesses of Barking were princesses or members of the most powerful families in the country, the relative anonymity of Katherine Sutton requires explanation. She may have had family connections for which evidence does not survive, or may have been elected solely for her personal qualities of leadership. The existence of a previous abbess of the same surname, Yolande Sutton, could be purely coincidental, but suggests that there was an established family association with the abbey. These two abbesses might have come from the Suttons of Dudley Castle, Staffordshire, or from the Suttons of Cheshire, who were later among the founders of Brasenose College, Oxford. On the other hand, the entry in the customary suggests a forceful personality, and Sibille Felton mentions no one else among her recent predecessors.<br>
<br>When it comes to claiming Katherine Sutton as a dramatist, problems arise from the nature of the material. Liturgical drama, drawing most of its dialogue from pre-existing antiphons and scriptural texts, does not usually have named authors, however distinctive the play. In contrast, religious plays performed outside the liturgy, as entertainment rather than worship, are sometimes ascribed to individuals. In addition, the Barking play, although unique in itself, is but one elaboration on an antiphon about the harrowing of hell which formed a standard part of the <i>elevatio</i> right across western Europe. Furthermore, there seems to have been an established tradition of lively liturgical drama at Barking: in 1279 Archbishop Peckham had had to admonish the nuns about maintaining the decorum of their Holy Innocents' play, and some of their other rituals have unusual elaborations, such as the washing of the crucifix-figure in wine at its &#145;burial&#146; on Good Friday. Against all this, there is the Barking customary's unique emphasis on Katherine's decrees about the Easter celebration. The text itself stresses her daring break with universal tradition in moving the <i>elevatio</i> from before to after matins. How much she contributed to the form of the <i>elevatio</i> itself depends on how much weight is given to the last phrase of the passage from the customary, how closely it may be linked with Katherine, and whether the Latin means that she ordained that the procession &#145;be ordered&#146; or &#145;be established&#146;: the latter would suggest the setting up of a new piece of liturgical action. It can be said with confidence, however, that Katherine struck her contemporaries as a woman of notable energy and decisiveness, and that they associated her name, in whatever way, with an interesting and unusual piece of liturgical drama.<br>
