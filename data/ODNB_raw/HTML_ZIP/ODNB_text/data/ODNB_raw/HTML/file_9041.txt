<span class="headword">Eyre, Sir  William</span>  (1805&#150;1859), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Hatfield on 21 October 1805, the younger son of Vice-Admiral Sir George Eyre (1769&#150;1839) and Georgina, daughter of Sir George Cooke, bt, of Wheatley. He was educated at Rugby School, where he remained from 1817 until commissioned ensign in the 6th regiment on 17 April 1823. He was promoted lieutenant in that regiment on 5 November 1825, and to a half-pay captaincy on 20 November 1827. He remained unemployed until 21 May 1829, when he received a company in the 73rd regiment, with which he continued nearly twenty-five years. The 73rd was stationed in the Mediterranean from 1829 to 1839, in which year Eyre was promoted major, serving in Canada from 1839 to 1841 and at home from 1841 to 1845. On 16 February 1841 he married Georgiana Lucy (1808&#150;1898), fourth daughter of the Hon. John Bridgeman Simpson (son of the first Baron Bradford); they left one son.<br>
<br>After a detour to fight at Montevideo, Eyre and his regiment reached the Cape of Good Hope in July 1846 and fought in the Cape Frontier War of 1847, with Eyre in command; he was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 12 November 1847. Eyre's fitness for irregular warfare in difficult terrain was recognized by the generals under whom he served, Sir Peregrine Maitland, Henry Somerset, and Sir George Berkeley. When the next frontier war broke out in 1851, he was at once ordered to the front, and placed in command of a column, consisting of his own regiment and some light infantry, by Sir Harry Smith. With this force he accomplished many important feats. On 16 April 1851 he defeated the enemy at Quibigui River, and on 10 September at Committees Hill; on 14 March 1852 he commanded the right column in the attack on Macomo's stronghold, and on 7 April he captured over 800 cattle in an independent expedition into the Amatola country.<br>
<br>When Sir George Cathcart succeeded Sir Harry Smith, he maintained Eyre in command of his independent column, and under the new commander-in-chief Eyre co-operated throughout the final operations of the war with the greatest credit. After the war Eyre was selected for the command of the 2nd brigade of the army, which Sir George Cathcart led in person to punish Moshesh, the Basuto chief. At the battle of Berea he commanded on the right, and did much to win the victory. Nevertheless, in private letters, later published, Cathcart blamed Eyre for thinking more of seizing cattle than of his military duties, which the latter denied in a letter to the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> (23 October 1856). In Fortescue's history of the British army Eyre is described as &#145;a highly accomplished bush-fighter&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 12.560). In his public dispatches Cathcart had nothing but praise for his subordinate, and Eyre was made CB and an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria, and promoted colonel on 28 May 1853.<br>
<br>Eyre shortly afterwards returned to England, and was then given command of the 2nd brigade of the 3rd division under his former chief, Cathcart. At the head of this brigade during the Crimean War he was present at the Alma, and was honourably mentioned for his command of the trenches during Inkerman. After that battle he succeeded to the command of the 3rd division, although he was not promoted major-general until 12 December 1854, in succession to Cathcart. He remained in the Crimea throughout the terrible winter of 1854&#150;5, and it was partly in recognition of this conduct that Lord Raglan gave him the command of the force which was directed to threaten the dockyard creek on 18 June 1855. Eyre was wounded in the face during the operations. He remained in the Crimea until the end of the war, and was made a KCB on 10 July 1855, and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and a knight of the Mejidiye in 1856.<br>
<br>In July 1856 Eyre was appointed to command the forces in Canada, but the privations of the Crimean winter had destroyed his health, and he had to resign in June 1859. He retired to Bilton Hall, near Rugby, where he died on 8 September 1859. A window was erected to his memory in Bilton church.<br>
