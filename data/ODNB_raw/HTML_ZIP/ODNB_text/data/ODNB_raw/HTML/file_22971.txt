<span class="headword">Rack,  Edmund</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Eusebius]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1735&#150;1787), <span class="occ">writer on agriculture</span>, was born in Attleborough, Norfolk, the son of Edmund Rack, weaver, and his wife, Elizabeth, a Quaker preacher. He was brought up as a Quaker, and was apprenticed to a shopkeeper in Wymondham. At the end of his apprenticeship he moved to Bardfield in Essex, and was employed as a drapery shopkeeper by a Miss Agnes Smith, whom he later married. He became interested in literature, and at the age of thirty began to write in magazines such as the <span class="italic">Monthly Ledger</span> and the <span class="italic">Monthly Miscellany</span> under the name Eusebius.<br>
<br>About 1775 Rack settled in Bath. While still living in Norfolk he had taken an interest in agriculture, and in 1777 he published a scheme for an agricultural society in the <span class="italic">Farmer's Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, which was to encourage agriculture in the counties of Somerset, Wiltshire, Dorset, and Gloucestershire. The society was founded in 1778 with Rack as secretary, and it later became the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society and thereafter the Royal Bath and West of England Society.<br>
<br>Rack edited three volumes of papers contributed to the Agricultural Society, including several of his own articles. His papers &#145;On the origin and progress of agriculture&#146; and &#145;The natural history of the cock-chafer&#146; were reprinted in volume 3 of Alexander Hunter's <span class="italic">Georgical Essays</span> (1803), and that on the cockchafer also appeared in the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> for 1784&#150;5. He edited the second edition of <span class="italic">Caspipina's Letters</span> (1777) by the Revd Jacob Duch&eacute;, to which he added an appendix on William Penn. Rack spent the final years of his life making a topographical survey of Somerset as part of a history of the county of Somerset. This work was published by the Revd John Collinson in 1791 in three volumes.<br>
<br>In 1779 Rack helped to found the Bath Philosophical Society, and he became its first secretary. His literary works included <span class="italic">Poems on Several Subjects</span> (1775), <span class="italic">Mentor's Letters Addressed to Youth</span> (1777)&#151;written five years previously for a few of his young friends&#151;which ran to four editions, and <span class="italic">Essays, Letters, and Poems</span> (1781). Philip Thicknesse accused him of writing <span class="italic">A Letter Addressed to Philip Thickskull, Esq.</span>, and responded with the satirical <span class="italic">Letter from Philip Thickskull, Esq, to Edmund Rack</span> (1780). Rack was in poor health for many years. From 1781 he lived at Harington Place, Bath, and from 1786 at 5 St James's Parade. He died in Bath on 22 February 1787. Richard Polwhele wrote an elegy in his memory.<br>
