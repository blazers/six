<span class="headword">Doubleday,  Henry</span>  (1808&#150;1875), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 1 July 1808 at 62 High Street, Epping, Essex, the elder of the two children of Benjamin Doubleday (1771&#150;1848), grocer and provision merchant, and his wife, Mary (1779&#150;1846). His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7846/', "Edward Doubleday (1810&#150;1849)")</script>, became a distinguished entomologist. A Quaker by birth, Doubleday attended the local Friends' school conducted by Isaac Payne. With congenial schoolfellows he studied the wildlife in the adjacent Epping Forest and the surrounding countryside, thereby laying the foundations of his life's work.<br>
<br>After leaving school Doubleday assisted in the family shop, and following his father's death its management devolved solely on him. This new responsibility restricted his hitherto frequent collecting trips; however, his correspondence with English and foreign naturalists continued throughout his life to be extensive, and he also contributed observations on birds, plants, and insects to scientific journals, notably <span class="italic">The Entomologist</span> and <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span>, both edited by his close friend Edward Newman. Doubleday was an original and lifelong member of the Entomological Society of London. In local affairs he succeeded his father as treasurer of the Epping and Ongar Highway Trust and Epping Poor-Law Union. An excellent shot and taxidermist, he assisted many authors of standard natural history works, including William Yarrell, for whom he provided specimens and notes for his <span class="italic">History of British Birds</span> (1837&#150;43), and Newman, who acknowledged his invaluable help in checking and correcting every column and sheet of his <span class="italic">Natural History of British Moths</span> (1869).<br>
<br>Shy and retiring, Doubleday was reluctant to appear in print and published little himself. Probably his earliest scientific note was on the hawfinch in 1837, which was written after several years' study and published study in <span class="italic">Jardine's Magazine of Zoology</span>. His study of birds, particularly in his earlier years, encouraged him to publish <span class="italic">Nomenclature of British Birds</span> (1836), a catalogue which passed through four editions. However, his arrangement of species attracted criticism. Among his other contributions to natural history were his recognition of the oxlip as a species distinct from the two other members of the same family, the primrose and the cowslip; this was later confirmed by Darwin. The attraction of sallow blossom in springtime for many moth species was noted by his first published entomological observation, and he also introduced a method of attracting moths by painting tree trunks with a treacle mixture. This method, known as &#145;sugaring&#146;, was based on an idea suggested by P. J. Selby of Twizzell, Northumberland, but had never before been practised. In 1843 Doubleday made a two-week visit to Paris in order to compare nomenclature with European lepidopterists. As a result on his return he devoted several years to the preparation of his <span class="italic">Synonymic List of British Lepidoptera</span> (1850). A second edition, adding the Tineidae, appeared in 1859, and later supplements identified over 2000 species; for a time it became a standard authority in Britain. Of his numerous foreign correspondents it was undoubtedly Achille Gu&eacute;n&eacute;e, the eminent French lepidopterist of Ch&acirc;teaudun, with whom Doubleday most closely co-operated.<br>
<br>Doubleday's neglect of business, for which he was unsuited, and a heavy financial loss from a bank failure in 1866, led eventually to the prospect of financial ruin and a breakdown in his health from which he never completely recovered. In December 1870 he was admitted to the Retreat, the Quaker mental institution at York, &#145;with his body and mind shattered&#146;, as the medical superintendent reported. After four months he returned home, where his distant cousin, Ann Main, continued to look after him. In his absence friends had contributed to a trust to provide for his maintenance and for his research, and he was thus enabled to pursue his studies at home. Doubleday died of a heart condition at his home, 62 High Street, Epping, on 29 June 1875. He was buried on 4 July in the Quaker burial-ground at Epping. Always commanding great respect for his opinions, he accumulated much practical knowledge of which little written evidence remained. He left behind a remarkably comprehensive but unlabelled British and European Lepidoptera collection for which a catalogue was published in 1877.<br>
