<span class="headword">Tennent,  Hamilton  Tovey-</span>  (1782&#150;1866), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, born at Garrigheugh, Comrie, Perthshire, on 20 August 1782, was the second son of John Tovey of Stirling and his wife, Hamilton, daughter of Sir James Dunbar of Mochrum and Woodside, third baronet, judge-advocate of Scotland, and his wife, Jacobina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hamilton. He was educated at Stirling, and on 28 December 1798 was commissioned as lieutenant in the Bombay military service. In 1801 he was posted to the 24th regular native infantry at Goa and was employed on active service against the Marathas. In 1805, while serving under Lord Lake at the siege of Bharatpur, he was severely wounded in an assault on the town. On 17 January 1811 he was promoted captain. In 1813 he was placed in command of Ahmednagar, and appointed brigade major at Poona. After more service against the Marathas he was appointed in 1819 private secretary to Mountstuart Elphinstone, governor of Bombay. He was promoted major on 19 January 1820, and accompanied Elphinstone on his tour through the province until November 1821, when he was compelled by the effect of his wounds to return to England. He retired from the service on 24 April 1824, being promoted lieutenant-colonel. In 1832 he succeeded to the estates of his cousin, James Tennent, of The Pynnacles, Great Stanmore, Middlesex, and of Overton, Shropshire, and assumed his surname and arms. In 1836 he married Helen, only daughter of General Samuel Graham, lieutenant-governor of Stirling Castle. They had no children. Tovey-Tennent was a large contributor to charitable objects. Among other gifts he presented a site for a new church at Stanmore in 1854, and contributed &pound;1000 to erect a school at Stirling. He died at The Pynnacles, on 4 March 1866. He was succeeded in his estates by his nephew, James Tovey-Tennent.<br>
