<span class="headword">McConnell,  William</span>  (1831&#150;1867), <span class="occ">cartoonist and illustrator</span>, was born in Warwick Street, London, on 29 September 1831, the son of an Irish tailor, and had a sister, Annie (who survived him). After seeing some of his early sketches Mark Lemon, the first editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, sent him to study wood-engraving with Joseph Swain. His first contribution to <span class="italic">Punch</span> (aged eighteen) seems to have been an illuminated capital (vol. 18, January&#150;June 1850). Thereafter he produced some sixty illustrations for the magazine, notably two whole-page political cartoons: &#145;Louis Napoleon Viewing the Body of Liberty&#146;, published on 4 December 1851, and &#145;The Rivals, or, A Military Position&#146;, published on 28 February 1852. In July 1852 he left after a dispute over money and &#145;the contumelious and shabby treatment meted out to him by Mark Lemon&#146;  (Spielmann, 460). He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (1851&#150;60) and the short-lived <span class="italic">Diogenes</span> (1853&#150;4, including the strip cartoon &#145;How Mr Poppleton Enjoyed a Masquerade&#146;).<br>
<br>In 1855 McConnell began drawing for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London Magazine</span>. He served as the first staff comic artist and political cartoonist on the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span> (1855&#150;61) and later on <span class="italic">The Train</span> (launched on 1 January 1856). In 1857 he illustrated a series of articles by George Augustus Sala for the <span class="italic">Leisure Hour</span>, and the following year he began contributing to another short-lived magazine, <span class="italic">Town Talk</span> (1858&#150;9); for the latter he supplied both full-page cartoons and a strip-cartoon series, &#145;The Adventures of Mr Wilderspin on his Journey through Life&#146;, by Andrew Halliday, which was later published as a book (1861). In the same year he illustrated Sala's &#145;Twice round the clock&#146;&#151;an account of life in London during a 24-hour period&#151;which was published in instalments from the first issue of the <span class="italic">Welcome Guest</span> (1 May 1858) and later (1859) became a very successful book. Another <span class="italic">Welcome Guest</span> serial which he illustrated for Sala was &#145;Make your game, or, The adventures of the stout gentleman, the thin gentleman and the man with the iron chest&#146;, later also published as a book (1860). In 1863 he contributed to the short-lived <span class="italic">Comic News</span> (1863&#150;4), in particular the strip &#145;The Adventures of Mr Swellington Fipps&#146;, and in 1864 he began drawing for <span class="italic">London Society</span> and the <span class="italic">Churchman's Family Magazine</span> and then the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span> (1865).<br>
<br>Among the books for which McConnell provided illustrations were G. Godwin's <span class="italic">London Shadows</span> (1854, though the title-page credits only John Brown); Oliver Oldfellow's <span class="italic">Our School</span> (1857); G. F. Pardon's <span class="italic">The Months</span> (1858); A. W. Cole's <span class="italic">Lorimer Littlegood Esq.</span> (1858); <span class="italic">Tom Thumb's Alphabet</span> (<i>c</i>.1860); R. J. Shields's <span class="italic">The Knights of the Red Cross</span> (1861); W. Smith's <span class="italic">Advertise: How? When?</span> (1863); <span class="italic">The Beautiful Picture Book</span> (1865); and the posthumous <span class="italic">My Pet's Picture Book</span> (1868), <span class="italic">The Turtle Dove's Nest</span> (1886), and <span class="italic">Nursery Rhymes</span> (1890). In April 1867 he sketched fifteen double portraits which, if inverted, showed animals (<span class="italic">As Brave as &hellip; a Lion</span>, <span class="italic">As Greedy as &hellip; a Pig</span>, and so on). However, illness prevented him engraving them himself, and they were later published posthumously as <span class="italic">Upside Down, or, Turnover Traits</span> (1868), with verses by Thomas Hood the younger.<br>
<br>In appearance McConnell was &#145;a handsome little fellow, bright, alert, and full of originality. He was always exceptionally well dressed&#146;  (Spielmann, 460), and was clean-shaven with dark hair and a short dark moustache. He signed himself M'Connell, McConnell, M<sup>c</sup>C, WM<sup>c</sup>, Mc, or one of two combinations of W and M which also include an A, suggesting another forename. An accomplished cartoonist and pioneer comic-strip artist, and &#145;one of the most successful book illustrators of our time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 172), he was &#145;a good and improving draughtsman, especially of horses; and he revelled in beggars, &#147;swells&#148; and backgrounds&#146;  (Spielmann, 461). McConnell died of consumption at his home, 17 Tavistock Street, London, on 14 May 1867 aged thirty-five.<br>
