<span class="headword">Craig,  Robert</span>  (1917&#150;1995), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born in Markinch, Fife, on 22 March 1917, the son of John Craig (1886&#150;1972), master mason, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peggie (<i>c</i>.1886&#150;<i>c</i>.1926), a linen weaver. He was educated at the Bell-Baxter high school in Cupar and then at St Andrews University, where he graduated MA in 1938 and BD with distinction in systematic theology in 1941. After an assistantship at St John's Kirk, Perth, he was commissioned as chaplain to the forces. He was mentioned in dispatches for bravery during the Normandy landings. In 1945 he was posted with the 1st King's Own Scottish Borderers to Palestine and Egypt. In 1947 he took up the scholarship that had been waiting for him, to Union Theological Seminary, New York, where he studied under Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich, and graduated STM <i>magna cum laude</i> in 1948. His St Andrews PhD (1950) was the basis of his book <span class="italic">Social Concern in the Thought of William Temple</span> (1963). The Christian concern for social justice was to be his lasting theme.<br>
<br>From 1948 to 1950, while he was finishing his PhD, Craig was deputy leader of the Iona community under Dr George McLeod. They were two contrasting personalities whose friendship lasted until death. On 26 June 1950 Craig married Olga Wanda (<i>b</i>. 1920), daughter of Michael and Helena Strzelec. They had met in Palestine when she was serving as a staff sergeant with the Polish Auxiliary Women's Service; there was one son and one daughter. Later in 1950 they went to South Africa, where Craig became professor of divinity at Natal University. In 1957 he was appointed professor of religion at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. In 1963 Craig returned to Africa, to Southern Rhodesia, as professor of theology in the University of Rhodesia. In 1980 he retired, having from 1969 been also principal and vice-chancellor of the university. In 1965 the party of Ian Smith had unilaterally declared independence, and intended to maintain white supremacy in Rhodesia. Liberal opinion across the world was against it, and even the Association of Commonwealth Universities threatened to boycott the University of Rhodesia. Friends advised Craig that he should not be there, but he felt that he was there for a purpose. The university was a multiracial institution (the only one in Rhodesia) and he intended to keep it that way. His sheer determination in defiance of the government succeeded, and in 1980 he was able to hand the multiracial University of Zimbabwe over to an African principal. He returned to Scotland having perforce left all his assets in Zimbabwe. An appointment to be minister of St Andrew's Memorial Church in Jerusalem took him back to familiar scenes and different political tensions. His gritty integrity and belief in the strength of ecumenical Christian fellowship made his leadership greatly valued, and he formed a close friendship with the mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek.<br>
<br>In 1985 Craig retired to the family home in Falkland, Fife, and to his surprise was called to be moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. He had never been to the general assembly before he took the chair in May 1986. His year as moderator showed the courage that characterized his whole life. He wore everywhere the eighteenth-century court-dress, lace, and tricorn hat of the moderator, but the message delivered in his gravelly Fife voice always addressed the contemporary world. On one occasion he alighted from a Lothian Region bus in full moderatorial dress at the front door of a social project he was due to visit, to be received by a slightly embarrassed civic delegation that had preceded him by limousine. His St Andrew's day sermon to the Scots MPs in Westminster did not endear him to the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher:<blockquote>We are in serious danger of becoming again two nations&#151;a few rich and many poor. We mobilized the best in human nature for justice and peace during the war. We are challenged to do the same for justice and peace today. (quoted in <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Feb 1995)</blockquote>A similar furore arose when as moderator he paid an unscheduled visit to the peace camp at Faslane. He was no pacifist: indeed, as honorary chaplain to the forces he once conducted three Remembrance day services at different military cemeteries in Jerusalem. However, he respected the pacifist witness, and he could not see why those making that witness at the Trident base should be deemed unworthy of a moderatorial visit.<br>
<br>Those who met Craig in Falkland during his retirement may well have imagined that he had never left the place. His Fife accent, his innate courtesy, his stocky figure (with a cigarette never far from his lips), and his unpretentiousness betrayed nothing of a life of distinguished service overseas, or of the distinctions he had gained&#151;a CBE (in 1981) and honorary degrees from St Andrews, Witwatersrand, Birmingham, Natal, and Zimbabwe. He was unawed by rank or labels, but treated everyone with the same courtesy and the same respect. As a father he encouraged and took pride in the achievements of his son and daughter, and in his final years enjoyed greatly the company and infant wisdom of his grandchildren. He died of a heart attack at his home, West Port, Falkland, Fife, on 30 January 1995 and was buried in Falkland. He was survived by his wife, children, and grandchildren.<br>
