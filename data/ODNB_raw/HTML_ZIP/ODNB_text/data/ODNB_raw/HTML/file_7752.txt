<span class="headword">Dodington,  George Bubb</span>, Baron Melcombe  (1690/91&#150;1762), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was the only son of Jeremiah Bubb (<i>d</i>. 1692) of Foy, Herefordshire, and his second wife, Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1721), daughter of John Dodington of Dodington in Somerset. Nothing is known of Jeremiah Bubb's origins, but he made his way as a minor courtier in the 1670s, probably through the offices of Lord Scudamore, and at the time of the duke of Monmouth's invasion in 1685 he was commissioned into the army as a captain. He later became acting commander of the Carlisle garrison, and in 1689 governor of the castle and one of the town's MPs.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Education and early political career</h2>After his father's death in 1692 young George Bubb's upbringing was supervised by his maternal uncle George Dodington (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;1720), a highly successful financier and contractor in the service of William III's armies who went on to a minor career in politics as an MP and office-holder, and latterly adopted Bubb as his heir. In 1703 Bubb was sent to Winchester College and in July 1707 he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, his age then being given as sixteen. At Lincoln's Inn, where he was enrolled in 1711, his studies had hardly begun when he was packed off later that year on a grand tour that lasted until 1713, taking him to France, the Low Countries, Switzerland, and Italy. In 1715 his uncle brought him into parliament for his own former seat of Winchelsea, and in May Bubb&#151;again presumably through his uncle's contacts among the new whig ministers&#151;was appointed envoy at Madrid where for the next two years he ably represented Britain's commercial interests and renegotiated several vital agreements with the Spanish court. He was replaced, however, in the summer of 1717, shortly after the beginning of the whig split, having already identified himself with the faction of Robert Walpole and Charles, second Viscount Townshend.<br>
<br>His uncle's death in March 1720 put Bubb in possession of a fine estate at Eastbury, Dorset, where a magnificent mansion designed by Sir John Vanbrugh was in the process of construction, an income of &pound;4000 per annum, and a fortune of &pound;100,000. He had already in 1718 taken the name Dodington. He quickly set about overturning his uncle's will and brought the Eastbury trust under his own direct control. In doing so, he set himself permanently at odds with one of the executors, his kinsman Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham (a cousin through his maternal grandfather's marriage into the Temple family), who stood next in line to the estate after another childless Dodington relation. Temple initiated a chancery suit against Dodington which kept him on tenterhooks well into the 1740s. The Eastbury &#145;palace&#146; was to cost Dodington more than &pound;140,000 to complete and was a drain on his pocket throughout most of his career. Its purpose was to fulfil Dodington's soaring, if buffoonish, aspirations to rank among the foremost whig grandees, and though loving nothing better than to ridicule and snipe at his colleagues in power, his pressing financial needs required the cushioning of salaried office. This weakness in his position, coupled with his naturally orotund personality, portly appearance, and sententious humour, ensured that he remained a political lightweight, a slightly ridiculous larger than life character, blinkered, vain, and with little principle.<br>
<br>In the early 1720s, however, everything seemed possible. Recognition of Dodington's elevated social status and his potential usefulness came almost as soon as his uncle was laid to rest with his appointment as lord lieutenant of Somerset, followed in the same year by the clerkship of the pells in Ireland, a life sinecure which yielded some &pound;2000 annually. At the 1722 election he fought a successful campaign at Bridgwater and continued to sit for that borough until 1754. In April 1724 Walpole selected Dodington to join him at the Treasury board as a lord commissioner. Walpole, of course, was at least partially mindful of Dodington's useful influence in several parliamentary boroughs&#151;Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (returning four MPs), Winchelsea, and Bridgwater&#151;which set him above most rank-and-file whigs. It was probably in 1725 that Dodington married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1756), daughter of Edmund Beaghan of Sissinghurst, Kent, though for reasons most likely connected with the chancery dispute concerning his estate, the union was concealed from the world until 1742. Dodington, however, was hardly the philandering type, a characteristic which only enhanced his absurd and old-fashioned bearing. The story was told that on one occasion he had urged himself upon a female acquaintance declaring &#145;Oh that I had you, but in a wood!&#146;, only to incur the lady's astonished, rather than shocked, response: &#145;In a wood, Dodington! What would you do&#151;<i>rob</i> me?&#146;  (Carswell, 169).<h2>
<a name="Middleyears"></a>Middle years</h2>Dodington was always much more intent on wooing politicians. In 1726, mortified by Walpole's recent failure to nominate him to the newly revived knighthood of the Bath, he published an epistle to the minister which, though complimentary, conveyed the pointed message that loyalty outshone merit as a qualification for advancement, an unmistakable hint of his growing discontent. At the accession of George II in 1727 he made an ill-judged bid to swing behind the new king's favourite Sir Spencer Compton, who it was generally believed would supplant Walpole. However, Walpole remained in office but in future was circumspect towards Dodington. Though remaining a member of Walpole's administration, Dodington aligned himself thereafter with its discontented elements, notably Lord Wilmington, as Compton had become, and Wilmington's kinsman the duke of Dorset. By 1732 Dodington was deeply in the confidence of Frederick, prince of Wales. Ministerial insiders felt that the prince used him more as a court jester off whom he could scrounge than as a serious political adviser. At all events, Dodington was too careful to allow the prince's headstrong feelings against the king's premier to run to extremes, and during the excise crisis in 1733 gave his royal prot&eacute;g&eacute; no encouragement to patronize the opposition. However, Dodington himself gave the government scant support for the measure in parliament, and in the aftermath recriminations were flung in his direction. Sir Robert Walpole's brother Horatio described him as &#145;the vilest man, vain, ambitious, loose, and never to be satisfied. He wants now to be a lord and when he is that he will want to be a duke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.427).<br>
<br>From the middle of 1734 the prince began to spurn Dodington's moderating influence and turned his attention to the young and certainly more provocative patriot &#145;cubs&#146;. For the next five years Dodington appears to have avoided any form of conduct which might be badly construed by his ministerial colleagues, and doggedly continued to fulfil his responsibilities at the Treasury board. He resisted the prince's strong overtures in February 1737 to support the opposition motion for an increase of his allowance from the king's civil list, but kept Walpole in suspense over the voting intentions of his five followers in the Commons until almost the last minute, savouring the moment when, on finally assuring the minister of his full support, he strode off before Walpole could finish uttering ungenuine promises of &#145;future expectations&#146;.<br>
<br>Dodington finally broke with Walpole in the spring of 1740, and in May was dismissed from his well-paid Treasury position. In the preceding months he had importuned relentlessly for a peerage which Walpole refused to sanction. Walpole told one colleague that &#145;there had been no cordiality between them ever since this King's reign &hellip; [he] thinks he is not considered enough&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1715&#150;54</span>, 1.501). With the approach of the next general election, Walpole went to endless lengths to usurp Dodington's hold over the four Weymouth and Melcombe seats, but this unseemly struggle only resulted in the election of three new MPs beholden neither to Dodington nor to Walpole. Failure in his other constituencies in 1741 meant an overall reduction in Dodington's Commons following from five to one. At some point before the election Dodington had established a rapport with the duke of Argyll, who had also lately taken himself and his Scottish followers into opposition. He soon found, however, that Argyll could not be animated into taking the initiative to co-ordinate the opposition forces in such a way that Walpole's entire administration might be replaced by a new one constructed on &#145;broad-bottom&#146; lines. In the debate on 21 January 1742 on the opposition motion calling for a secret committee on the war, Dodington described the minister's whole administration as &#145;infamous&#146;. Walpole thrust back in his reply, pointing out that Dodington was &#145;a person of great self-mortification, who for sixteen years had condescended to bear part of the odium&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 17.297). Dodington did not profit from Walpole's fall at the beginning of the following month despite much expectation that he would become secretary at war in the new administration. For the next few years he languished discontentedly in opposition, dabbling in various journalistic ventures among which was his <span class="italic">Comparison of the Old and New Ministry</span>. In 1744 he collaborated with Henry Fielding's assistant, the historian James Ralph, on a more searching piece of polemic, <span class="italic">The Use and Abuse of Parliaments</span>, a work which argued that the Walpole administration had unravelled rather than safeguarded the achievements of the 1688 revolution.<br>
<br>In December 1744 Dodington's political fortunes took a turn for the better when Henry Pelham brought him back into government in the lucrative post of treasurer of the navy. Participation in office offered him interim contentment, but his ultimate goal, a peerage, still eluded him. By 1749 he was therefore prepared to accept an invitation from the prince of Wales to join his household in the senior position of treasurer of the chamber, with a salary of &pound;2000. Encouragement to sever once more his ties with the government lay in the apparent certainty that the prince's accession could not be many years away. He was duly promised not only a peerage but also a secretaryship of state upon George II's demise, while in the meantime he was to have &#145;principal direction&#146; over the prince's affairs. There were also promises &#145;in reversion&#146; for a number of Dodington's friends such as Sir Francis Dashwood and Lord Talbot. Although Dodington's seniority&#151;he was now not far off sixty&#151;and experience were essential to a group largely of younger political aspirants, he was variously disliked, viewed with suspicion, and regarded as a coxcomb by other leading figures at <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96922', "Leicester House")</script>, the centre of the prince's court. The chief of these was the second earl of Egmont, who wrote that Dodington &#145;presumes a great deal&#151;and hints at measures quite contrary to our system&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1715&#150;54</span>, 1.502). In a memorial to the prince, Dodington condemned the aggressive style of opposition pursued by Egmont and his colleagues and warned that its factional overtones would affect its credibility. However, his attempts to discipline the behaviour of the prince's followers and urge them to play a dignified and patient &#145;waiting game&#146; only alienated him further from Egmont and his associates, and they refused to consult with him on parliamentary business and tactics. Dodington thereafter quickly tired of his master's meagre understanding of political affairs, and after one of his gibes reached the prince's ears, communication between them all but ceased. The prince accordingly relegated him from future high office to the less exalted household position of master of the wardrobe. Frederick's sudden death, however, on 20 March 1751, after a brief illness, brought this phase of Dodington's career to an abrupt and unexpected end.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Dodington was once more in the political wilderness and left to his own resources. He at first thought of retirement, and indeed his parliamentary attendance slackened considerably. His health now somewhat impaired by a hernia, he spent an increasing amount of time at La Trappe, the villa on the riverbank at Hammersmith which he had acquired in 1749 and where he loved to play the consummate host to an odd coterie of friends, retainers, and minor literati. At Eastbury, Hammersmith, and his town house in Pall Mall he surrounded himself in tasteless splendour. His own literary endeavours were nondescript occasional pieces couched in his usual high-flown, lapidary prose. A far more significant though private venture, however, was the diary which he had begun to keep in 1749. Recording day to day the intrigues of an apparently compulsive, self-seeking place-hunter who seemed equally attached to the sentiments of virtue and poetry, Dodington's diary, first published in 1784, has subsequently anchored his reputation as the archetypal eighteenth-century man of politics.<br>
<br>Dodington succeeded in establishing a reasonable accord with the Pelhams, but the king's prejudice against him on account of his previous connection with the prince of Wales precluded any possibility of office. On Pelham's death in March 1754 Dodington made his court to Pelham's brother the duke of Newcastle, now head of the administration, but he was unable to secure a promise of the treasurership of the navy for which he had been angling. At the ensuing general election he lost his long-held Bridgwater seat to his <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>, Lord Egmont, but was elected for Weymouth, where he was able to put two other seats at the ministry's disposal.<br>
<br>The following year, however, Dodington forgot all thoughts of retirement as he became ineluctably drawn into the complex struggle for leadership of the House of Commons between William Pitt and Henry Fox that took place during the summer and autumn of 1755. Dodington, it must be said, had already cast himself as a Pitt supporter in March, but as spring gave way to summer he saw the benefits to be reaped from the tentative alliance forming between Pitt and the new &#145;reversionary interest&#146; now centring upon the dowager princess of Wales and her young son Prince George (the future George III). In the aftermath of Prince Frederick's death, Dodington had found the princess uninterested in forming her own political party, but with Pitt's involvement the new Leicester House group had healthy prospects of success. While doing all he could throughout the late summer to encourage Pitt's aspirations, Dodington nevertheless kept up a dialogue with the duke of Newcastle. Thus in October, when the scales began to tip against Pitt in favour of Fox, Dodington was easily won over by the duke and in December, after Pitt and his friends had been finally dismissed from the administration, Dodington was given back his old office. Under repeated barracking from Pitt, however, the Fox&#150;Newcastle ministry weakened and in November 1756 collapsed. Dodington was turned out of the navy treasurership to make way for Pitt's brother-in-law George Grenville. In February 1757 he briefly rose above his normally self-interested political stance and in delivering what Horace Walpole described as a &#145;humane and pathetic speech&#146; in the Commons was one of the few to defend the unfortunate Admiral John Byng against those who desired his execution for the loss of Minorca.<br>
<br>Dodington returned to office for a short time from April to June 1757 during the interregnum that followed Pitt's dismissal, but again had to make way for Grenville when Pitt formed his great administration with Newcastle. By the end of the year Dodington was in contact with the prince of Wales's tutor, the earl of Bute, now resigned to await whatever rewards would follow upon the death of George II. Dodington's wait was longer than he anticipated, and when the king finally died in October 1760 old age and infirmity barred him from any post in the new administration. The young king did, however, fulfil his father's promise of a peerage, and on 6 April 1761 Dodington was duly created Baron Melcombe of Melcombe Regis. In the final year of his life Dodington gave vent to angry impatience with Pitt and the war, though soon the old confidence between himself and Bute fell away until Bute ignored him altogether. Dodington died at his Hammersmith residence on 28 July 1762 and was buried at Fulham. Since he left no issue, the Eastbury estate went as directed in the original entail to Richard Grenville, first Earl Temple, nephew of his old antagonist Lord Cobham who had died in 1749, and his disposable property, including the manuscript diary, to another cousin, Thomas Wyndham of Hammersmith.<br>
