<span class="headword">Iona,  abbots of</span>  (<em>act. </em>563&#150;927)<span class="occ"></span>, played a major role in the history of Ireland and Britain from the foundation of Iona by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6001/', "Columba (Colum Cille)")</script> in 563 until the tenth century. The evidence is unusually good up to the mid-eighth century. The lost annals of Iona formed the basis to <i>c</i>.740 for the chronicle of Ireland; the latter is no longer extant in its original form, but in derived texts, and especially in the annals of Ulster, much of the annals of Iona is preserved. Annalistic evidence for the sequence of abbots can be tested against a list preserved in the confraternity book of Salzburg, consisting, with the addition of Patrick, Ciar&aacute;n, and Columbanus, of the abbots of Iona to Sl&eacute;ib&iacute;ne (<i>d</i>. 767, the fifteenth abbot). A collection of genealogies of those abbots who belonged to Cen&eacute;l Conaill (Columba's kindred) originally also extended as far as Sl&eacute;ib&iacute;ne. In addition, texts about Columba himself reveal much about attitudes both at and to Iona; two of them were composed by abbots. These texts extend from the <span class="italic">Amra Choluim Chille</span> (&#145;The wonderful [praise] of Colum Cille&#146;), a difficult poem very probably composed shortly after the saint's death in 597, via two other poems of the mid-seventh century, to a fragment of a life by Cumm&eacute;ne (<i>d</i>. 669) and a complete life by Adomn&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. 704), the ninth abbot. A text no later than <i>c</i>.700 gives an account of Columba's companions in his pilgrimage to Britain in 563 and of some of his relations by marriage. Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span> is revealing about Iona's relations with the English and, to a lesser extent, the Picts; for example, Bede says that Iona, an island off the west coast of Mull, was given to Columba by a Pictish king rather than by the ruler of D&aacute;l Riata (an Irish kingdom including the north-eastern part of modern co. Antrim and also what is now Argyll in Scotland).<h2>
<a name="ThecompanionsofColumba"></a>The companions of Columba</h2>The first three abbots of Iona, <a href="#cosubject_39128">Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne</a>, <a href="#cosubject_39266">Laisr&eacute;n</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_39245">Virgno [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were all monks during Columba's lifetime. Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne, indeed, was not only, like Laisr&eacute;n, a kinsman of Columba from the royal lineage of Cen&eacute;l Conaill, but he had also been one of the twelve companions said to have accompanied the saint on his pilgrimage to Britain in 563. Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne, Laisr&eacute;n, and another close kinsman and original companion of Columba, his uncle Ern&aacute;n, appear in Adomn&aacute;n's life as an inner core of trusted lieutenants and advisers. Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne was prior of the daughter monastery of Mag Lunge on Tiree, Ern&aacute;n of another Hebridean daughter house on the unidentified island of &#145;Hinba&#146;, and Laisr&eacute;n was prior of the monastery of Durrow in the midlands of Ireland, probably founded between 585 and Columba's death in 597. Virgno, on the other hand, was not a kinsman of Columba; indeed a Middle Irish note to the martyrology of &Oacute;engus calls him a Briton; this is confirmed by the life of Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne, discussed below, and also supported by his absence from the eighth-century collection of genealogies of U&iacute; N&eacute;ill abbots of Iona (almost all from Cen&eacute;l Conaill). Yet, he apparently had Irish connections: his sister's son, Comm&aacute;n, bore an Irish name.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_39128"></a><span class="headword">Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne mac Br&eacute;nainn</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Conin]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 598)<span class="occ"></span> was designated as abbot by Columba, that is, by the founder and <i>patronus</i> of the community&#151;a community known as the <i>familia</i> (&#145;household&#146;) of Columba or of Iona. Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne, originally named Conin, was the subject of a short life of uncertain date, but probably of the eighth century, in which he was remembered as the pre-eminent pupil of Columba, inferior in knowledge of the scriptures only to his teacher. Columba was perceived by Adomn&aacute;n as Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne's &#145;foster-father&#146; as well as his kinsman  (Adomn&aacute;n, 1.2, 3.18). Indeed, the bond between Columba and Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne was not represented so much as one of physical as of spiritual kinship, expressed in the language of secular fosterage. The nature of the bond is represented by the story Adomn&aacute;n tells of the designation of Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne as successor. Columba was copying a psalter and got as far as the verse of <span class="roman">Psalm 33</span>, where it is written, &#145;But they that seek the Lord shall not want for anything that is good.&#146; At this point, which was also the end of a page, he laid down his pen and declared, &#145;Here, at the end of the page, I must stop. Let Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne write what follows&#146;  (Adomn&aacute;n, 3.23).<br>
<br>This story is, however, something of an exception to the way in which Adomn&aacute;n normally presented Columba. If the texts about Columba are compared, in particular the <span class="italic">Amra Choluim Chille</span> of <i>c</i>.597 and Adomn&aacute;n's life of about a hundred years later, there are two striking contrasts which must be important for the history of the community in the seventh century. In the <span class="italic">Amra</span> the principal characteristic of Columba is his outstanding reputation as an exegete; Adomn&aacute;n does not, of course, deny Columba's learning, but it is subordinated to his role as a prophet, a miracle worker, and one who enjoyed the companionship of angels. In this emphasis on scriptural knowledge, the <span class="italic">Amra</span> is supported by the mid-seventh-century poems. Secondly, the <span class="italic">Amra</span> presents Columba as the missionary of the Picts, and not so much the northern Picts as those around the Tay. Any notion that the Picts were not effectively converted by Columba and his immediate disciples is incompatible with the <span class="italic">Amra</span>, and indeed has required an implausibly late dating for the poem.<br>
<br>The inheritance bequeathed by Columba to his chosen successor was, therefore, a demanding one. In Ireland there were dependent houses, perhaps mainly in the north-west, where Cen&eacute;l Conaill was the ruling kindred, but also in the midlands; this confederation of monasteries was closely linked with the power of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, of whom Cen&eacute;l Conaill was a branch. In Pictland, a full-scale mission was under way. And, for Iona itself, a reputation for outstanding learning had been established. It is worth noting that Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne's short life concentrates on learning and says nothing of Pictland or of Ireland beyond a story implying both a respect for holy men who had remained in their native land and also Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne's fitness to be included among the holiest as well as the most learned of their number. This is not surprising, since Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne appears to have lived for only one year after Columba's death; he was said to have died on the very same day as his foster father, so that their feasts were celebrated together on 9 June.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_39266"></a><span class="headword">Laisr&eacute;n mac Feradaig</span> <span class="st"> [Laisr&aacute;n]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 605)<span class="occ"></span> was also abbot for a fairly short period. Adomn&aacute;n's life places him at a greater distance from Columba than was Ba&iacute;th&eacute;ne. The only story involving Laisr&eacute;n in a role of any consequence concerned the latter's period as superior of the community at Durrow. He is said by Adomn&aacute;n to have overworked the monks when they were erecting a large building. Columba, seeing this in a vision, was greatly distressed until Laisr&eacute;n ordered the monks to stop, have a meal, and rest while the bad weather lasted. Columba ceased to weep and in his joy blessed Laisr&eacute;n as &#145;the consoler of the monks&#146;  (Adomn&aacute;n, 1.29). Since Columba's blessings were usually modelled by Adomn&aacute;n on <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> benedictions, the story is likely to have been intended to imply that Laisr&eacute;n was destined by Columba to succeed him in the future; it presumably also implied that he was remembered on Iona as a kindly abbot. He is said to have died on 16 September.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_39245"></a><span class="headword">Virgno</span> <span class="st"> [Fergna Brit]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 623)<span class="occ"></span> was the first abbot with the time to emerge out of Columba's shadow. He was also the first not to be of Cen&eacute;l Conaill. To judge by what Irish law had to say at a later date about churches controlled by the kin of the <i>patronus</i> (often, but not always, the founder), Virgno should have been a man of considerable ability. That he was very probably a Briton, presumably from what is now southern Scotland, makes his succession all the more remarkable. Iona later had an English bishop, Coeddi (<i>d</i>. 712), but Virgno was the only non-Irish abbot. This is also what Iona remembered: he is described by Adomn&aacute;n (writing of Columba's lifetime) as &#145;a young man of good ability, who later, by divine authority, was in charge of this church&#146;  (Adomn&aacute;n, 3.19). Adomn&aacute;n's story told of Virgno praying during the night and so becoming by accident the witness of a visitation of heavenly light upon Columba. Virgno is said to have told this story to his sister's son, a priest called Comm&aacute;n, after Columba's death, and Comm&aacute;n told it to Adomn&aacute;n. Virgno's death was commemorated on 2 March.<h2>
<a name="TheheightofIonasinfluence"></a>The height of Iona's influence</h2>It was probably during Virgno's time that Oswald of Bernicia (<i>d</i>. 642) and his brothers established contacts with Iona. Oswald was exiled together with his brothers, sons of the former king, &AElig;thelfrith, when the latter's rival, Eadwin of Deira, came to power in 616. Both Oswald and Oswiu (<i>d</i>. 670) are shown by Bede to have been able to speak Irish, whereas their elder brother, Eanfrith, appears to have had closer connections with the Picts. When, therefore, Oswald came to power in Northumbria in 634, he sent a message to Iona requesting that a bishop be sent to preach to his people. The annals of Ulster record the foundation of Lindisfarne, by the Monk &Aacute;ed&aacute;n, (<i>d</i>. 651), in the very same year as Oswiu's victory over the British king Cadwallon. Whether Lindisfarne was really founded so quickly is doubtful, but what is striking is that it is given its British name (Medgoit) in the Irish annals, which may suggest some continued British presence close to Lindisfarne or British aid for &Aacute;ed&aacute;n's mission.<br>
<br>The abbot at the time was <a name="cosubject_39277"></a><span class="headword">S&eacute;g&eacute;ne mac Fiachna</span>  (<em>d.</em> 652)<span class="occ"></span>, a kinsman of Columba. He appears to have taken a direct interest in the Northumbrian mission. A story told by Adomn&aacute;n reveals Columba's support for Oswald's victory over Cadwallon. It was said to have been told by Oswald to S&eacute;g&eacute;ne in the presence of Fa&iacute;lbe, Adomn&aacute;n's predecessor as abbot and his informant. This meeting between abbot and king very probably took place in Northumbria rather than in D&aacute;l Riata, since the annals show that abbots of Iona not infrequently visited churches subject to their authority. S&eacute;g&eacute;ne was also responsible for sending F&iacute;n&aacute;n to Northumbria after &Aacute;ed&aacute;n's death in 651, the year before his own death. Earlier, in 635, he had founded a monastery called &#145;Rechru&#146;, probably Lambay Island, but possibly Rathlin Island. By the time of his death on 12 August 652, however, political conditions in the midlands of Ireland were becoming less favourable to Iona. After the death of Domnall mac &Aacute;eda, Cen&eacute;l Conaill king of Tara, in 642, supreme power among the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill was divided between Cen&eacute;l Conaill and the rulers of Brega (roughly modern co. Meath and north co. Dublin). The latter were forming close ties with Armagh, probably as a counterweight to the alliance between Iona and Cen&eacute;l Conaill. It may be for this reason that Durrow is not once mentioned by the annals in the seventh century.<br>
<br>S&eacute;g&eacute;ne's successor, <a name="cosubject_39282"></a><span class="headword">Suibne moccu Urthr&iacute;</span> <span class="st"> [Suibhne]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 657)<span class="occ"></span>, was the second abbot of Iona not to be a kinsman of the founder. His name shows that he came of a minor group, Corcu Urthr&iacute; (Corco Fhirthri), attested in connection with the people known as the Luigni, both in northern Connacht and in Meath. It may have been felt to be wise not to bind Iona too closely to Cen&eacute;l Conaill, whose power, after the deaths of Cellach C&oacute;el (654) and Cellach mac M&aacute;ele Coba (658), continued to decline from the peak it had reached <i>c</i>.640. During Suibne's time, F&iacute;n&aacute;n, bishop of the Northumbrians, sent missionaries to the Middle Angles and then Mercia, and also to Essex. When Suibne died (probably on 11 January), therefore, the authority of Iona, direct and indirect, stretched in a great arc from Durrow in the very centre of Ireland, through northern Ireland, Scotland, Northumbria, Mercia, and as far as the Thames. If Suibne's successor (and brother of S&eacute;g&eacute;ne, Suibne's predecessor) <a name="cosubject_6890"></a><span class="headword">Cumm&eacute;ne Albus</span> <span class="st"> [Cumine Ailbhe]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 669)<span class="occ"></span> had visited the churches of the Ionan mission to the English, as he may well have done, he could have visited the Saxon shore fort at Ythanc&aelig;stir (Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex), where Cedd (<i>d</i>. 664) built a church, or have looked out from Cedd's other recorded church at Tilbury, across the Thames estuary to Kent.<br>
<br>It was, however, in Cumm&eacute;ne's time that Iona suffered the greatest blow to its power, the Synod of Whitby (664). Since the death of &Aacute;ed&aacute;n in 651, the Roman position on the dating of Easter and the tonsure had been advanced in Northumbria, first by an Irishman, R&oacute;n&aacute;n, and subsequently by Wilfrid. Wilfrid had serious political backing from Oswiu's son and sub-king Alchfrith. Probably under pressure from Alchfrith, Oswiu summoned a council, over which he himself presided, at Whitby. Colm&aacute;n, then bishop of the Northumbrians, could not have made any serious concession without authority from Iona; he, like his predecessor F&iacute;n&aacute;n, was an Iona appointee. He appears from both accounts of the synod to have based his case principally on the holiness of Columba.<br>
<br>The continued identification of Columba's monks with their <i>patronus</i>, as well as his reputation for scriptural scholarship, made it exceedingly difficult for his heirs to make any major change. S&eacute;g&eacute;ne had refused to change in the early 630s when an Irish churchman, Cummian, sent him an elaborate letter justifying change to the paschal reckoning of Victorius of Aquitaine, and also in 640, when he and other northern Irish churchmen had received a letter from the pope-elect John urging them to accept the Alexandrian Easter. It is consistent with his conservative attitude on Easter that he was also notably active in collecting stories about Columba. Similarly, Cumm&eacute;ne, whose death occurred on 24 February 669, was responsible for the first known life of Columba, in which he emphasizes the fearsome consequences for D&aacute;l Riata which flowed from their king having broken one of Columba's commands.<h2>
<a name="IonaafterWhitby"></a>Iona after Whitby</h2>The effect of the Synod of Whitby was to remove Northumbria and other English churches from any control by Iona. Colm&aacute;n had to leave and he was succeeded by an Englishman trained in southern Ireland. True, Wilfrid was to meet with opposition from those Northumbrians whom his disciples called Quartodecimans (that is, heretics on Easter), but there is no evidence that anyone sought to re-establish the authority of Iona. On the contrary, the terms of Pope Vitalian's letter to Oswiu and the eagerness of Wilfrid to extend his &#145;kingdom of churches&#146; northwards <i>pari passu</i> with Ecgfrith's military aggression threatened an English intervention unfavourable to the authority of Iona, whether among the Picts or even in D&aacute;l Riata. When Wilfrid was expelled from the bishopric of York and thus attended a synod held by Pope Agatho in Rome in 680, he &#145;confessed the true and catholic faith for all the northern part of Britain and Ireland, and for the islands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Bishop Wilfrid by Eddius Stephanus</span>, chap. 53). The ambition betrayed by this claim might well have been alarming to one such island, Iona: Wilfrid was hoping to make York the successor to Iona, not just in Northumbria but among the Picts and even in northern Ireland. He could entertain such ambitions only because Iona remained faithful to the Celtic Easter and tonsure. In Ireland, too, the shockwaves from Whitby were being felt. The arrival of St Theodore as archbishop of Canterbury (669) brought to England a man who believed that the community of Iona was heretical, and who almost certainly enjoyed a direct papal commission as archbishop of Britain (rather than as metropolitan bishop of a province embracing only southern Britain, as in Gregory the Great's scheme). Very probably in response to this event, the church of Kildare in Leinster (orthodox on paschal matters), and subsequently Armagh, developed claims to an archbishopric of Ireland. In the third quarter of the seventh century, the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill of Brega were at the height of their power (which explains why Brega was attacked by the Northumbrians in 684). They were more favourable to Armagh than to Iona. The ten years of the abbacy of <a name="cosubject_61633"></a><span class="headword">Fa&iacute;lbe mac P&iacute;p&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 679)<span class="occ"></span>, whose death was commemorated on 22 March, and the early years of his successor, Adomn&aacute;n, were, therefore, particularly unfavourable to Iona. Fa&iacute;lbe's long visit to Ireland, stretching from 673 to 676, may have enabled him to shore up Iona's position. Both of the two references to Fa&iacute;lbe in Adomn&aacute;n's life of Columba show him in close association with S&eacute;g&eacute;ne and as a link in the chain by which stories about Columba came to Adomn&aacute;n. He was, perhaps, not likely to make any change in Iona's position on the Easter question.<br>
<br>His successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/110/', "Adomn&#225;n (d. 704)")</script>, bequeathed a position to his successors that was much stronger in terms of the political environment, but weaker in so far as the community of Columba was now divided over the Easter question. The defeat and death of Ecgfrith of Northumbria at the battle of Nechtansmere, 685, to be succeeded by his half-brother Aldfrith, brought to the throne a personal friend of Adomn&aacute;n. The death of F&iacute;nsnechtae Fledach, king of Tara, ten years later, in 695, ended for the time being the domination of the kingship of Tara by the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill; Cen&eacute;l Conaill would be the most powerful branch for the next generation. In the course of two visits to Northumbria to negotiate the release of captives held since the 684 attack on Brega, Adomn&aacute;n had been persuaded to change to the Roman Easter. Armagh had probably abandoned the Celtic Easter <i>c</i>.685 and Adomn&aacute;n's conversion may have been due as much to changes in Ireland as to the learning and eloquence of his Northumbrian hosts. The effect of these changes was that the northern half of Ireland had probably entirely conformed to the Roman Easter before the end of the seventh century.<br>
<br>The community of Iona itself, however, remained unwilling to change. The result was a split within the <i>familia</i> of Columba which was to endure until Iona itself finally conformed in 716. The split was almost certainly the reason why in the early eighth century there were often two abbots of Iona. The &#145;Hibernian&#146; abbot of Iona in succession to Adomn&aacute;n appears to have been <a name="cosubject_39199"></a><span class="headword">Conamail mac Fa&iacute;lbi</span>  (<em>d.</em> 710)<span class="occ"></span>; his &#145;Roman&#146; counterpart from 707 was <a name="cosubject_39218"></a><span class="headword">D&uacute;nchad mac Cind Fh&aacute;elad</span>  (<em>d.</em> 717)<span class="occ"></span>. Initially, therefore, one abbot seems to have succeeded Adomn&aacute;n; but his unwillingness to change and the difficulties likely to have been experienced by a Hibernian abbot in coping with Columban churches in Ireland that were now Roman made it easier to have two abbots. Their backgrounds were significantly different. Conamail belonged to the U&iacute; Moccu Uais, a client people in what is now co. Londonderry; D&uacute;nchad, on the other hand, was not merely of Cen&eacute;l Conaill but also of its ruling branch: his grandfather and two uncles had been kings of Tara. Admittedly by the time he became abbot the descendants of his grandfather, M&aacute;el Coba, had lost power to those of M&aacute;el Coba's brother, Domnall mac &Aacute;eda; but none the less D&uacute;nchad's genealogical position within Cen&eacute;l Conaill was the strongest of any abbot of Iona including Columba. Not only was Conamail mac Fa&iacute;lbi likely to have enjoyed less influence in Ireland, but so also was another apparently &#145;Hibernian&#146; abbot, <a name="cosubject_39217"></a><span class="headword">Dorb&eacute;ne mac Alta&iacute;ni</span>  (<em>d.</em> 713)<span class="occ"></span>, of a less powerful branch of Cen&eacute;l Conaill. The likelihood is, therefore, that Adomn&aacute;n had secured the adhesion of Cen&eacute;l Conaill to the Roman Easter, as Bede's story implies, and that the abbacy of D&uacute;nchad flowed partly from their desire to see Iona itself conform. They may have been in a position to put particular pressure on Iona because of an ambiguity in the law concerning family monasteries&#151;should, on the one hand, an outsider, such as Conamail mac Fa&iacute;lbi, resign as soon as a kinsman of the <i>patronus</i> appeared who was fit for the office, or should he continue to rule until he died?<br>
<br>The background to the final decision to conform, taken in 716, can be inferred from Bede and from the annals. Of the abbots thought to have been Hibernian in sympathy, Conamail had died in 710, probably on 11 September, and Dorb&eacute;ne obtained the <i>kathedra</i> of Iona in the summer of 713 only to die five months later on 28 October. Dorb&eacute;ne was the person who possessed the Schaffhausen manuscript of Adomn&aacute;n's life of St Columba, where he might have read how, more than a century earlier, Columba had prophesied the conflict over Easter. Meanwhile D&uacute;nchad remained abbot. An English bishop of Iona, Coeddi, died on 24 October 712; and he may have been replaced by Ecgberht (<i>d</i>. 729), who, according to Bede, came to Iona at about this time and was strongly Roman in his sympathies. The Northumbrians defeated the Picts near Stirling in 711; the letter of Ceolfrith, abbot of Wearmouth&#150;Jarrow, to Nechtan, son of Derilei and king of the Picts, which must have been written between 705 and 716, is perhaps more plausibly dated a year or two after this battle rather than before. In that case, the arrival of Ecgberht on Iona is unlikely to have been later than the letter to Nechtan. The letter was designed to persuade the king to conform to the Roman Easter and tonsure; but it included, as one of its arguments, a passage on Adomn&aacute;n's work in northern Ireland in favour of the Roman cause. In other words, since Ecgberht probably worked closely with D&uacute;nchad, the Roman abbot of Iona, the letter of Ceolfrith to Nechtan can best be seen as encouragement to Nechtan to bring the Picts into alliance with D&uacute;nchad and Ecgberht. Given the warm appreciation of Adomn&aacute;n by Ceolfrith and Bede, and Bede's exceedingly favourable attitude to Ecgberht, it is unlikely that the letter was intended to break the connection between the Picts and Iona.<br>
<br>In spite of this array of persuasive forces, the change was not accomplished easily. On Iona, Easter itself was changed in 716. This seems to have been followed by the resignation of D&uacute;nchad, who was to die on 25 May 717. His successor was <a name="cosubject_61634"></a><span class="headword">F&aacute;elch&uacute; mac Dorb&eacute;ni</span>  (<em>d.</em> 724)<span class="occ"></span>, who belonged to a remote collateral branch of Cen&eacute;l Conaill. By this stage Northumbria was in confusion, with the killing of the king, Osred, son of Aldfrith, in 716, and the death of the next king, Coenred, son of Cuthwine, in 718. In 717, however, apparently after the death of Abbot D&uacute;nchad, King Nechtan drove the community of Iona out of Pictland, westwards into D&aacute;l Riata; and in 718 the community of Iona received the Petrine tonsure.<br>
<br>Nechtan's expulsion of the community of Iona in 717 is not easy to explain. Assuming that D&uacute;nchad had been abbot for the Romani, his sphere would have included the Picts under Nechtan, if they had changed to the Roman Easter before 716 in response to Ceolfrith's letter. Nechtan may not have accepted the terms of the settlement, perhaps because he was not consulted, and perhaps because the influence he had over a Roman abbot of Iona would inevitably be greater than it was over an abbot accepted by all. Alternatively, it may have been that Nechtan expelled those who were making difficulties about accepting the Roman tonsure. It would, in any case, be very unsafe to infer from the annals that the link between the Picts and Iona was permanently broken in 717. Further difficulties are suggested by an entry in the chronicle of Ireland for 722, &#145;Feidilmid assumed the <i>principatus</i> of Iona&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 722). Feidilmid is not included in the Salzburg confraternity book, which agrees with the picture of the succession given by another entry in the chronicle of Ireland s.a. 724: &#145;F&aacute;elch&uacute; son of Dorb&eacute;ne, abbot of Iona, slept; Cill&eacute;ne the Tall succeeded him in the <i>principatus</i> of Iona&#146;  (ibid., s.a. 724). Although F&aacute;elch&uacute; was nearly eighty by 722, neither the phrasing of the entry for that year nor the one for 724 suggests that F&aacute;elch&uacute; had resigned. There were serious internal struggles among the Picts which might have had an effect on Iona, but these seem to have become serious only in 724.<h2>
<a name="ThealliancewithClandCholmin"></a>The alliance with Cland Cholm&aacute;in</h2>In 724 when <a name="cosubject_61635"></a><span class="headword">Cill&eacute;ne Fota</span>  (<em>d.</em> 726)<span class="occ"></span> became abbot, Cin&aacute;ed mac &Iacute;rgalaig was king of Tara. Cin&aacute;ed came from the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill of Brega, but he was to be the last of that branch to gain the kingship of Tara for many generations. After his death, Flaithbertach mac Loingsig of Cen&eacute;l Conaill was king of Tara until 734; he also was the last member of his branch of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill to gain the kingship of Tara for centuries. These branches, dominant since the sixth century, were ousted by other U&iacute; N&eacute;ill kindreds, Cland Cholm&aacute;in, rulers of Mide, and Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain from the valley of the Foyle, now supreme among the southern and northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill respectively.<br>
<br>In 726 Cill&eacute;ne the Tall (who died on either 14 or 19 April) was succeeded by his namesake, <a name="cosubject_39147"></a><span class="headword">Cill&eacute;ne Droichtech</span>  (<em>d.</em> 752)<span class="occ"></span>, whose name is literally &#145;little man of the church [and] bridge builder&#146;. He belonged to the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, but to a collateral branch identified neither with the rulers of Brega nor with those of Mide. In 727 the relics of Adomn&aacute;n were taken to Ireland and <span class="italic">C&aacute;in Adomn&aacute;in</span> (&#145;the law of Adomn&aacute;n&#146;) was renewed. The <i>c&aacute;in</i> (<i>lex</i> or <i>rechtge</i>) of this kind was an edict established by a combination of royal and ecclesiastical authority, usually under the patronage of a saint, whose relics might be brought on circuit. The validity of the <i>c&aacute;in</i> was normally temporary (perhaps seven years), and it might thus be renewed; while it was in force, it was secured by an elaborate structure of sureties and pledges, designed to ensure that all authority, whether of kindred, lord, king, or church, had both an obligation and an interest in upholding the law. In the eighth and early ninth centuries these <i>c&aacute;nai</i> or <i>leges</i> were to be the most dramatic expression of ecclesiastical influence on Irish society. A subsidiary purpose of Cill&eacute;ne's renewal of the law of Adomn&aacute;n was, according to a late text, to establish peace between the two great branches of the northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, Cen&eacute;l Conaill and Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain. Even though the information is from a late source, it is plausible: Adomn&aacute;n's foundation at Raphoe was associated with his law, and it lay in the small kingdom of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ndai, situated between Cen&eacute;l Conaill and Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain. The peace may indeed have lasted long enough to help Flaithbertach mac Loingsig of Cen&eacute;l Conaill to defeat and kill Cin&aacute;ed mac &Iacute;rgalaig in 728 and to reign for a few years as king of Tara. The relics of Adomn&aacute;n were, however, brought back from Ireland in 730, and in 732 fighting broke out again between Cen&eacute;l Conaill and Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain, leading in 734 to the abdication of Flaithbertach mac Loingsig and the succession of his enemy &Aacute;ed All&aacute;n mac Fergaile.<br>
<br>In 737 &Aacute;ed All&aacute;n showed his appreciation of the significance of the <i>c&aacute;in</i> and his refusal to continue the alliance with Iona hitherto characteristic of the northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. He first held a meeting, situated close to the frontier, with Cathal mac Finguine, king of Munster, whereupon, in the words of the annals, &#145;the Law of Patrick was in force throughout Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 737). He had done precisely what Adomn&aacute;n and his kinsman Loingsech mac &Oacute;enguso, king of Tara, had done in 697 when they established <span class="italic">C&aacute;in Adomn&aacute;in</span> at a great assembly at Birr on the borders between Munster and the lands of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill; but this time it was the power of Patrick and Armagh which was displayed, not that of Adomn&aacute;n or Columba. It may well have been Cill&eacute;ne Droichtech who brought about a realignment in Iona's alliances in order to meet the new situation. The traditional allies of Armagh were the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill of Brega; its new allies were Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain; Cland Cholm&aacute;in of Mide, however, had no strong and exclusive alliance among the great churches. The ruler of Mide in the middle years of the eighth century was Domnall mac Murchada (<i>d</i>. 763), who may have been buried at Durrow. A number of things may have conspired to forge the alliance between Cland Cholm&aacute;in and Iona, which was to rescue her influence in Ireland from the threat posed by the decline of Cen&eacute;l Conaill: Domnall's friendship with Durrow, Cill&eacute;ne Droichtech's family connections in the midlands, and Domnall's policy of using the king of Cen&eacute;l Conaill (weakened and therefore not a dangerous rival) as a deputy ruler in the north.<br>
<br>The full effects of this realignment were visible in the time of Cill&eacute;ne Droichtech's successor, <a name="cosubject_39281"></a><span class="headword">Sl&eacute;ib&iacute;ne mac Congaile</span>  (<em>d.</em> 767)<span class="occ"></span>. Cill&eacute;ne seems to have resigned the abbacy before his death on 3 July 752, since his obit gives him the title &#145;anchorite of Iona&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 752). Resignation followed by a period as anchorite was a well-attested practice, found, for example, in the case of &Aacute;ed, bishop of Sleaty in Carlow, who died as an anchorite in 700. Sl&eacute;ib&iacute;ne also seems to have resigned before his death, which occurred perhaps on 2 March, since his successor, <a name="cosubject_39283"></a><span class="headword">Suibne <span class="st"> [Suibhne]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 772)<span class="occ"></span>, was abbot by 766.<br>
<br>In 753 the law of Columba was proclaimed by Domnall mac Murchada, and in 754 Sl&eacute;ib&iacute;ne went to Ireland. He was presumably still there when, in 757, he also promulgated the law of Columba. However, when Domnall mac Murchada died in 763, his successor, Niall Frossach, was from Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain; he, following the pattern established by his brother, &Aacute;ed All&aacute;n, promulgated the law of Patrick in 767. Before Niall's death in 778 he had lost the kingship of Tara to Domnall's son Donnchad (<i>d</i>. 797). He, together with Suibne's successor as abbot, <a name="cosubject_39135"></a><span class="headword">Bresal mac S&eacute;g&eacute;ni</span>  (<em>d.</em> 801)<span class="occ"></span>, promulgated the law of Columba in 778. The continued spiritual reputation of Iona in his time is attested by the pilgrimage in 783 of Artgal, son of Cathal, king of Connachta, to Iona, where he died in 791.<br>
<br>Bresal's successor, <a name="cosubject_39200"></a><span class="headword">Connachtach</span>  (<em>d.</em> 802)<span class="occ"></span>, was abbot for only a year; he died on 10 May 802 and is described in an obit as an excellent scribe, namely, in the terminology of the Irish annals, a scriptural scholar. This suggests that Iona had not abandoned the traditions of scholarship characteristic of the seventh and early eighth centuries. His successor, <a name="cosubject_61636"></a><span class="headword">Cellach mac Congaile</span>  (<em>d.</em> 815)<span class="occ"></span>, was responsible for building the new monastery at Kells, beginning in 807. When he had completed the buildings in 814, he resigned the abbacy and died the next year.<h2>
<a name="Ionaandthevikings"></a>Iona and the vikings</h2>The building of &#145;the new monastery of Columba&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 807) at Kells was an expression of the alliance between Cland Cholm&aacute;in and Iona. It may also have been intended as a refuge from viking attacks for vulnerable and precious possessions, among them, perhaps, the <span class="roman">Book of Kells</span>. The vikings began their attacks in 794. They burnt Iona in 802 and killed sixty-eight of the community in 806; this particular attack may have been behind the building of Kells. In 825 <a name="cosubject_39134"></a><span class="headword">Bla&iacute;mac mac Flainn</span> <span class="st"> [Blathmac]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 825)<span class="occ"></span> was martyred on Iona by &#145;the heathens&#146;; his death was commemorated in a poem by Walafrid Strabo, abbot of Reichenau (<i>d</i>. 849).<br>
<br>In the long term the growing power of the vikings in the Western Isles was to make the position of Iona extremely insecure. The monastery inevitably found it difficult to maintain its role as the principal ecclesiastical link between Britain and Ireland. It attempted to do so by the same practice of making prolonged tours that had long been used to buttress the bonds of the <i>familia</i> of Columba in Ireland. At some point in the eighth century, Columba's remains appear to have been elevated from their grave in the monastic cemetery and enshrined. In 818 <a name="cosubject_61637"></a><span class="headword">Diarmait alumnus Daigri</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 831)<span class="occ"></span>, who had been abbot since 814, made a visit to Britain with the shrine of Columba; just as, in 849, his successor, <a name="cosubject_61638"></a><span class="headword">Innrechtach ua Finnachtai</span>  (<em>d.</em> 854)<span class="occ"></span>, went with the relics of Columba to Ireland. Innrechtach was martyred by Englishmen on 12 March 854, while on pilgrimage to Rome. His successor, <a name="cosubject_61639"></a><span class="headword">Cellach mac Ailella</span>  (<em>d.</em> 865)<span class="occ"></span>, is described in his obit as abbot of Kildare and Iona and as dying in Pictland; this combination is perhaps explained by the links of Cin&aacute;ed mac Ailp&iacute;n, king of Scotland, with Leinster. Nothing is known of the next two abbots, <a name="cosubject_61640"></a><span class="headword">Feradach mac Cormaic</span>  (<em>d.</em> 880)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_61641"></a><span class="headword">Flann mac Ma&iacute;le D&uacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 891)<span class="occ"></span>, apart from their names and obits. Flann, who died on 20 April, was, however, succeeded by <a name="cosubject_61642"></a><span class="headword">M&aacute;el Brigte mac Torn&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 927)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 22 February and who contrived to be both abbot of Armagh and abbot of Iona. It is quite uncertain whether M&aacute;el Brigte spent any significant time on Iona. The headship of the community of Columba was now passing to Kells.<br>
