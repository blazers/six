<span class="headword">Noble,  Montague Alfred</span>  (1873&#150;1940), <span class="occ">cricketer and dentist</span>, was born on 28 January 1873 at Dixon Street, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the eighth son of Joseph Noble, grocer and later builder, and his wife, Maria Collins. His parents had emigrated from Egham, Surrey, earlier in the nineteenth century. After leaving school he was briefly a bank clerk before qualifying as a dentist in 1901, setting up in practice, and becoming in 1902 a dental surgeon at the dental hospital in Sydney.<br>
<br>Throughout his cricketing life, Noble was associated with the Paddington club, and first played for New South Wales on their New Zealand tour in 1894. Later in the year he made 152 not out for a Sydney colts eighteen against A. E. Stoddart's English tourists. He made his d&eacute;but in test cricket against England at Melbourne in 1898, taking 6 wickets for 49, appearing &#145;in the colonial team with the happiest results&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1899, 393). It was as an all-rounder&#151;one of Australia's greatest&#151;that he played in a further forty-one consecutive matches for Australia up to 1909, including four tours to England and one to South Africa.<br>
<br>Although Noble's only test century was against England at Sydney in 1903, he had the ability to bat defensively for long spells, never more so than at Manchester in 1899 when&#151;in two innings of 60 not out and 89&#151;he was at the wicket for eight and a half hours to save the match. He bowled his off-breaks at a brisk pace, relying on swerve rather than spin. At Melbourne, against England in 1902, he had a match analysis of 13 for 77. Six months later, in the only test ever played at Sheffield, he took 11 for 103, &#145;breaking back again and again in an unplayable way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1903, 269). In test cricket he made 1997 runs (30.25) and took 121 wickets (25.00).<br>
<br>In 1903 Noble was appointed captain of Australia, and, apart from the tour to England in 1905, he remained so for six years. &#145;Mary Ann&#146;, as he was nicknamed from his initials, was an authoritarian figure and a disciplinarian who later trenchantly expressed his views on captaincy in his book <span class="italic">The Game's the Thing</span> (1926). Of him C. A. Macartney wrote: &#145;a strong character, hard but just. His judgement of other players' capabilities was astonishing. He was a rare personality and I know of none greater&#146;  (Pollard, 214).<br>
<br>Noble was an equally dominant figure in the controversies of the day between players and administrators, being briefly suspended (with nine other players) by the New South Wales Cricket Association in 1906 when he led the opposition on behalf of players' rights. Later he wrote in the press that the Australian board of control in the six years of its existence had &#145;not been credited with one single act of conciliation or forbearance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 29 Feb 1912). The upshot of these conflicts was the refusal of many leading players to travel to England in 1912, though by now Noble (almost forty years of age) had virtually retired from first-class cricket.<br>
<br>Noble married on 14 January 1914 Elizabeth Ellen Ferguson (<i>d</i>. 1963); her brother, William Ferguson (1880&#150;1958), was a scorer and baggage-man for forty-three overseas tours. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Test cricket apart, Noble's record as a batsman in the Sheffield shield competition was unmatched until the era of W. H. Ponsford and Don Bradman. Two of his highest scores in first-class cricket were both made against Sussex (284 in 1902 and 267 in 1905), while for New South Wales against Victoria in 1905 he made 281. When he retired in 1919 he had made 13,975 runs (40.74) and taken 625 wickets (23.11). He continued to play first-grade cricket for Paddington until 1925 and, as he had done thirty-one years earlier, played that year for a colts eleven (as their mentor) against an England eleven led by A. E. R. Gilligan, on whose tour he wrote <span class="italic">Gilligan's Men</span> (1925), one of four major contributions he made to the literature of cricket.<br>
<br>Noble's commanding personality must have contributed to his election as president of the Dental Association of New South Wales in 1915. He briefly relinquished his career in dentistry but returned to it in the 1930s. In a full life, he was variously a New South Wales selector, a cricket journalist, a pioneer of test match broadcasting, and the president of the New South Wales Baseball Association. He died in Sydney on 22 June 1940, and was buried at Waverley cemetery, Sydney. A stand at the Sydney cricket ground is named after him.<br>
