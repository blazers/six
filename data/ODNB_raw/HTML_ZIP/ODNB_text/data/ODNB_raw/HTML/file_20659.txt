<span class="headword">O'Kelly,  Charles</span>  (1621&#150;1695), <span class="occ">army officer and historian</span>, was the eldest son of John O'Kelly (<i>d</i>. 1674), eighth lord of the manor of Screen, co. Galway, and Isma, a daughter of Sir William Hill. He was born at Screen, but educated at St Omer in the Spanish Netherlands. There &#145;he went thro' the Course of his Studies with Great Reputation, and became well versed in the Knowledge of most of the European Languages, such as Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, English and Irish&#146;  (<span class="italic">General History of Ireland</span>). He returned to Ireland in 1642 after the outbreak of civil war and served with his father on the royalist side by commanding a troop of horse in Ormond's army. After the triumph of the English parliamentarians he sailed to Spain with 2000 Irish soldiers to serve the exiled Charles II. He later joined the king in France, but was forced to return to Spain following Cromwell's treaty with the French in 1657. He travelled to England at the Restoration in 1660, &#145;highly esteemed for his Learning, Loyalty and great services both at home and abroad&#146;  (ibid.) and his father was able to reclaim the family lands in Galway. O'Kelly succeeded his father as lord of Screen in 1674. He married Margaret O'Kelly (<i>fl</i>. 1650), a daughter of Teigue O'Kelly of Gallagh, co. Galway.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of civil war in 1689 O'Kelly, at the age of sixty-eight, volunteered for service in King James's Irish army. Although he neither raised nor commanded a regiment, he was given the rank of colonel and served in a staff capacity. After being forced to abandon Sligo in August 1689, Patrick Sarsfield pulled his forces back to Roscommon where he left O'Kelly in command while he travelled to Dublin to report. Seeing that the enemy had not pursued Sarsfield from Sligo, O'Kelly took it upon himself to march back to Boyle and establish himself there. At daybreak on 20 September 1689 he was attacked by Thomas Lloyd's Enniskillen troops, who routed his men at what became known as &#145;the break of the Boyle&#146;. O'Kelly was forced to flee, leaving behind him all his baggage and his portmanteau of private papers. Nevertheless, the Enniskilliners' success was short-lived as in the next month O'Kelly marched back with Sarsfield and helped to command the force that recaptured Sligo.<br>
<br>In 1690 O'Kelly was appointed high sheriff of co. Roscommon, where it would seem he remained until September 1691. After the battle of Aughrim (12 July 1691) and the surrender of Galway (28 July), the Irish troops in Roscommon and Sligo were isolated from the main army at Limerick. On the road to Sligo he met, by chance, Baldearg O'Donnell, who commanded a private army of Ulster Gaels. O'Donnell had entered into negotiations with the Williamites, and O'Kelly attempted to persuade him to remain faithful to the Jacobite cause. Nevertheless, O'Donnell and his men changed sides and reinforced the Williamite troops in Roscommon, who then marched on Sligo in early September. On their way they forced O'Kelly to surrender a castle outside Boyle. The terms of surrender allowed him to march to Limerick, which he reached before the siege began. On 14 September 1691 O'Kelly warned Sarsfield that Brigadier Robert Clifford, who commanded the Jacobite troops on the co. Clare bank of the Shannon where a Williamite crossing was anticipated, was not to be trusted. He urged him either to send a trusted officer or come himself to command. His advice was not taken and that night the enemy built a pontoon bridge across the river and at dawn established themselves on the Clare bank. Nine days later a ceasefire was agreed, after which Sarsfield wanted him to assist in negotiating the terms of a treaty. Nevertheless, he took no part, perhaps because his uncompromising views were thought unhelpful.<br>
<br>O'Kelly's family estates were secured by his being included under the terms of the treaty of Limerick (3 October 1691), after which he retired to Screen. In the following year he wrote the curiously entitled <span class="italic">Macariae excidium, or, The Destruction of Cyprus containing the last war &amp; conquest of that kingdom written originally in Syriak by Philotas Phyloxypres, translated into Latin by Gratianus Ragallus P.R. and now made into English by C:&ocirc; K: anno domini: 1692</span>. The work remained obscure until the nineteenth century, when it was published three times. There are early manuscript copies in the British Library and Trinity College, Dublin. All the named participants and places are disguised by classical names: Ireland is referred to as Cyprus, and England as Cilicia. James II, William III, St Ruth, and Tyrconnell are given the names Amasis, Theodore, Phyrrus, and Coridon. Sarsfield is given that of the Spartan general Lysander. <span class="italic">Macariae excidium</span> is primarily a political rather than a military account of the war in Ireland of 1689&#150;91. &#145;The loss of Cyprus cannot be justly imputed to the Cowardice or Infidelity of the Natives, but rather the wrong Politicks of a weak Prince&#146;  (O'Kelly, <span class="italic">Macariae</span>, 6). The work is particularly hostile to Tyrconnell, whom O'Kelly accused of betraying the Irish cause to the English, and although the portrayal of Sarsfield is generally favourable, he did not escape O'Kelly's criticism for administrative incompetence and for negotiating with the enemy. He was highly critical of the treaty of Limerick. It would, he wrote, take someone else to write a history of the treaty as it would require &#145;Ink mixed with the Writer's Teares; and the Fountain of my weak Eyes hath been drained up already by the too frequent Remembrance of the Slaughter at Acra [Aughrim], and the sad Separation at Paphos [Limerick]&#146;  (ibid., 159).<br>
<br>O'Kelly wrote another account of the war, as well as an account of the war that followed the 1641 rebellion, in his &#145;M&eacute;moires du Colonel Charles O'Kelly de Skryne, sur les guerres d'Irlande de 1641 et suivans, et de 1689 et suivans&#146;. This document was preserved by the O'Kelly&#150;Farrell family in France, but was lost at the time of the French Revolution. He again used the device of disguising the names and, as the key to the names referred to in the &#145;M&eacute;moires&#146; survived, it would appear that the account of the 1689 war contained more detail than is to be found in <span class="italic">Macariae excidium</span>.<br>
<br>O'Kelly died at Screen aged seventy-four. &#145;He was a person of great abilities, piety, and universal knowledge, and was justly esteemed one of the wisest as well as the most accomplished men of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">General History of Ireland</span>). His only son, Captain Dennis O'Kelly, served at Aughrim and succeeded to the lands at Screen. He married a daughter of Lord Bellew, but became &#145;attached to low intrigues and dissipation&#146;  (O'Kelly, <span class="italic">Macariae</span>, xviii). He was predeceased by his three children, and his wife fled to France to get away from him. He died in 1740, leaving his lands to his uncle John O'Kelly.<br>
