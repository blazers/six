<span class="headword">Isherwood,  Annie Cecilia Ramsbottom <span class="st"> [Cecile]</span></span>  (1862&#150;1906), <span class="occ">Anglican nun and educationist</span>, was born on 14 November 1862 at Hillingdon Lodge, Uxbridge, the youngest of six children of Captain Richard Ramsbottom-Isherwood (<i>d</i>. 1874), an army officer, and his wife, Anna Clarendon Cox (<i>d</i>. 1870) of Fairfield, New South Wales. She was always known as Cecile. Her mother died when she was eight and her father was killed in an accident when she was thirteen. She attended a boarding-school at Brighton, after which she lived with the family of one of her father's fellow officers and continued her education in lectures and classes.<br>
<br>Entering by chance St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, in London, when she was sixteen, Cecile Isherwood heard a sermon by the vicar, G. H. Wilkinson (1833&#150;1907), later primus of the Scottish Episcopal church, who was seeking missionaries. Deeply impressed by it, she was confirmed by him and devoted herself to social work in his parish. In 1883, on hearing the newly appointed bishop of Grahamstown, A. B. Webb (1839&#150;1907), preach in the same church, she offered herself for service in his diocese, and was ordained deaconess.<br>
<br>Grahamstown, in the eastern Cape, had been bitterly divided by a quarrel between the previous bishop and the dean. Bishop Webb wished to recruit women who would be rooted in the diocese and help him in a mission of reconciliation. Ultimately he hoped to form a sisterhood which would extend mission and educational work to people of all races. On the voyage out in 1883, from among the dozen women whom he had recruited, he singled out Cecile Isherwood to be their leader, although she was only twenty-one years old. In 1884 the Community of the Resurrection of Our Lord was established in Grahamstown with Sister Cecile as the first novice. In 1887 she professed and became mother superior, with Bishop Webb as warden. The community rapidly expanded and opened schools in Grahamstown, for both paying and poor girls, and a boarding-house for children of itinerant railway workers. In Port Elizabeth nursing staff were provided for the hospital and a school was established for coloured children; a school and industrial centre was also set up for African girls. Having been an orphan herself, Mother Cecile was horrified by the practice by which orphans were lodged in prisons and she lobbied in the hall of the Cape legislature until funds were provided for an orphanage.<br>
<br>The most important work, however, was the establishment by the community of the Grahamstown Teaching College in 1894. Mother Cecile, unlike some of her more eager sisters, saw that it was even more important for the community to train teachers than to teach children themselves, and that this training in a local college, with a school attached, was likely to be much more effective than the preparation of girls as prospective teachers in Britain. Later she regarded the training of Dutch (Afrikaner) and British girls together as an important contribution to reconciliation after the South African War.<br>
<br>Dr Muir, the Cape superintendent-general of education, a Scottish Presbyterian, was not predisposed to favour denominational education. Mother Cecile, however, won his support and that of the Grahamstown community by the appointment, despite the misgivings of some Anglicans, of nonconformist governors and by the admission of nonconformist ministers to instruct their co-religionists. She believed strongly in co-operation with the state authorities, but this required that government standards must be maintained. Thus she had to spend much of her time raising money for the purpose, and visiting Britain to do so, particularly when&#151;at Muir's request&#151;the training was extended from the primary to the secondary level.<br>
<br>It was this unceasing effort, when her doctors had prescribed complete rest, which precipitated Mother Cecile's death at 14 Upper Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood, London, after an operation for an internal growth, on 20 February 1906 at the age of forty-three. Her last message to her community, was &#145;Sparkle. &hellip; Don't let the fun go out of the place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mother Cecile in South Africa</span>, 92). She died so young that the two men who had inspired her spiritual pilgrimage, bishops Wilkinson and Webb, were present at her funeral in the church where it had started. She was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 24 February. She had been a remarkable institution builder, charming Joseph Chamberlain, the colonial secretary, and Dr L. S. Jameson, prime minister of the Cape, into financial support; but by her associates it was more for her spiritual leadership that she was remembered. She deliberately welcomed novices who would bring new kinds of gifts to the community, never trying to press them into a mould but allowing each personality to develop naturally. On the racial question she not only worked for reconciliation between British and Boers but also declared that the church could never do enough to make up for the great wrong which the white race had done to black people.<br>
<br>Mother Cecile was tall and slender with brown eyes which her contemporaries remembered as both magnetic and twinkling. Revd E. J. Bodington, who succeeded Bishop Webb as warden, described her as having &#145;The finished manners of a woman of the world with just a touch of the kindness of a saint&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mother Cecile in South Africa</span>, 143). She is commemorated in the calendar of the Anglican church in southern Africa.<br>
