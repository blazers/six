<span class="headword">Clifford,  Thomas</span>, eighth Baron Clifford  (1414&#150;1455), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born at Skipton Castle on 20 August 1414, the son of John, seventh Baron Clifford (1388/9&#150;1422), and his wife, Elizabeth Percy (<i>d</i>. 1436). Thomas was not quite eight when his father was killed in France, on 13 March 1422, leaving him heir to the baronies of Westmorland, centred upon Appleby, and Skipton in Craven, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In February 1423 his mother and grandmother (Elizabeth Ros, widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5662/', "Thomas Clifford, sixth Baron Clifford")</script>) paid 800 marks for his marriage and wardship, and on 1 August 1424 entered into an agreement with Thomas, Lord Dacre, whereby Thomas Clifford was to marry Dacre's daughter Joan (<i>b</i>. before 1424, <i>d</i>. before 1455). The match maintained a political alignment originating in John Clifford's minority, linking the Cliffords with the Percys and the offspring of the first marriage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland")</script> (who included Thomas Dacre's wife, Philippa), in opposition to the children of Westmorland's second marriage, headed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19954/', "Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury")</script>.<br>
<br>John Clifford had been only two when his father died in 1391. In 1396 Richard II granted the lordship of Penrith, at the southern end of Cumberland, to Ralph Neville, in 1397 made Neville earl of Westmorland, and early in 1398 gave him the shrievalty of the latter county, in flagrant disregard of the Cliffords' hereditary right in that office. Three months later this last grant was revoked, as a result of opposition which may well have been led by the Percys, but Clifford suspicion of Neville ambitions in the north-west, so close to their own power base, persisted. In 1404 the first earl of Northumberland, acting with the consent of John Clifford's mother, married John to his own daughter Elizabeth, in the process overriding a grant of John's marriage made in August 1403 to Joan Beaufort, the earl of Westmorland's second wife and the earl of Salisbury's mother. When the elder Elizabeth Clifford died in 1424, it can have done nothing to appease Clifford fears that the lordship of Brough, part of her dower, should during her grandson's minority have been awarded to Salisbury, to help him maintain himself in the office of warden of the west march. Two years later Thomas Clifford's mother remarried; her new husband was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19952/', "Ralph Neville, second earl of Westmorland")</script>, who was then engaged in a bitter dispute with Salisbury over the first earl's estates.<br>
<br>Under the indenture of 1424 Thomas Clifford was brought up by his father-in-law, Lord Dacre, who in February 1434 was ordered to bring him before the king's council. He was now twenty years old, and it may have been decided to send him to France&#151;&#145;The sonne and heire of the lord Clifford, after lord Clifford&#146; was said to have been a member of the duke of Bedford's retinue before the latter's death in the following year  (Stevenson, 2.435). In 1435 he came of age and had livery of his lands, including Brough. On 1 May 1436, no doubt under compulsion, Clifford made a release for wastes perpetrated on his lands to the earl of Salisbury, who in the meantime had been confirmed in his office of steward of the lordship of Kendal. However, Clifford's own resources increased when his mother died on 16 October 1436, giving him possession of her dower. He also began to take part in public affairs. In August 1436 he was a commissioner to resist the Scots when they attacked Berwick and Roxburgh. On 10 December he received his first summons to parliament. From 1437 he was regularly a JP and a commissioner in Westmorland and the West Riding of Yorkshire. But unlike his father and grandfather, he did not risk dissipating his strength in campaigns and other adventures overseas&#151;reports of his military prowess in France in the sixteenth-century writings of Polydore Vergil and Edward Hall are unsubstantiated by contemporary records, and can be discounted.<br>
<br>Instead Clifford made strenuous efforts first to recover and then to maintain his family's position in the north-west. In 1437 he is recorded as carrying out substantial works on Skipton Castle&#151;which explains why he spent that year at Conisbrough Castle, the dower house of his aunt Maud, countess of Cambridge. When Maud died in 1446, her bequests to her nephew included a bed which was to remain forever at Skipton. Clifford also financed a new hall and chapel at Appleby Castle, completing the work in 1454. His political activities between 1437 and the early 1450s are not in general well documented, but their pattern is clear enough. He continued to resist the earl of Salisbury, in the process allegedly countenancing, or even instigating, some of the disorders which troubled the peace of Cumbria during these years, and he maintained his alliances with the senior line of Nevilles and with the Percys. When on 8 August 1444, in two separate transactions, he conveyed his principal estates to two groups of feoffees, one group was headed by Sir John Neville, the second earl of Westmorland's brother, and the other by the earl of Northumberland. One of his daughters, Anne, married Sir Richard Tempest, and another, Elizabeth, married successively Robert Plumpton (<i>d</i>. 1450) and William Plumpton (<i>d</i>. 1461), sons of Sir William Plumpton (<i>d</i>. 1480); both the Tempests and the Plumptons had close links with the Percys.<br>
<br>In 1448&#150;9 there was a sharp outbreak of Anglo-Scottish hostilities. Clifford was among the northern lords sent to defend the marches, and thanked for their services afterwards. And once the fighting was over, he was several times commissioned to negotiate truces with the Scots, and to maintain them once they were agreed upon. Yet although his interests always lay primarily in the north, Clifford did not neglect to maintain links with the court and central government. He was regularly summoned to parliament, though he did not always come&#151;in 1454 he was fined &pound;40 for failing to attend. In 1444 he accompanied the earl of Suffolk to France to bring Margaret of Anjou to England. In 1448 he was a supplementary feoffee for the duchy of Lancaster estates under Henry VI's will. He was also a feoffee for the first duke of Buckingham, and an executor for John Talbot, later second earl of Shrewsbury. His sons Roger and Robert married into the Courtenay and Berkeley families respectively.<br>
<br>Although it is possible that he had shown hitherto underappreciated military or organizational skills in the war against the Scots, his contacts with the court and southern nobility may provide one explanation for Clifford's appointment in March 1452 to assemble ships and sailors for the relief of Calais, threatened by the French. Another may lie in a growing involvement with north-east England, especially with the East Riding of Yorkshire. In 1451 he was granted the subsidy and alnage on cloths in Yorkshire, York, and Hull, and in the early 1450s he was among the noblemen cultivated by the townsmen of York and Hull. Above all, some time before 1454 his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5654/', "John Clifford")</script>, married Margaret, daughter and heir of Henry Bromflete, Lord Vescy, an important landowner in the East Riding. Perhaps Clifford hoped to give himself greater freedom for manoeuvre by expanding into a region where the Nevilles were considerably less powerful than the Percys.<br>
<br>Although Clifford was among the lords who confronted the duke of York at Dartford in February 1452, in this he was probably showing loyalty to the king rather than a personal hostility towards the duke. There can be little doubt, however, about his animus towards the earl of Salisbury, as he showed in October 1453, when he joined the Percys in a confrontation with the Nevilles at Topcliffe which only just failed to turn into outright battle. In January 1454 he was reported to be in alliance with the duke of Exeter and Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, in enmity to the Nevilles. Perhaps he had doubts about the wisdom of associating with Egremont, for when York became protector on 27 March 1454, Clifford was prepared to act with him in a commission of oyer and terminer in Yorkshire, and was even instructed to act against Egremont's &#145;misgovernance and assembles&#146; in Westmorland  (<span class="italic">Proceedings &hellip; of the Privy Council</span>, 6.194&#150;5), though he cannot be shown to have done so. But when York's protectorate ended in January 1455, Clifford continued to be associated with the court. He was present when his enemy Salisbury resigned as chancellor on 7 March, and was among the king's supporters when they confronted York and the Nevilles at St Albans on 22 May. Indeed, he played a leading part in the battle, so much so that attempts were made afterwards to blame him for its having taken place. When the fighting began he &#145;kept so strongely the barreres of the same towne&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Vale's Book</span>, 192) that the Yorkists were forced to make a flank attack to break into the town. But when they did so Clifford was killed, perhaps the victim of Neville score-settling, though once the battle was lost his prominence in the fray was such as to place him in great peril. His body, which was at first left lying in the street, was later buried in the lady chapel of St Albans Abbey church. His wife Joan Dacre, by family tradition, &#145;dyed butt a litle before him&#146;  (books of record, 2.432). They had four sons&#151;John, Roger, Robert, and Thomas&#151;and five daughters&#151;Elizabeth (who married, in succession, the brothers Robert and William Plumpton [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52793/', "Plumpton family")</script>]), Maud, Anne, Joan, and Margaret.<br>
