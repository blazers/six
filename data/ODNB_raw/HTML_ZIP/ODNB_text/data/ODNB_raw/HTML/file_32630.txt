</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cripps, Sir  (Richard) Stafford</span>  (1889&#150;1952), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer</span>, was born at Elm Park Gardens, London, on 24 April 1889. He was the fifth and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32629/', "Charles Alfred Cripps (1852&#150;1941)")</script> and his wife, Theresa (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Potter) (1852&#150;1893). His father, a successful and prosperous barrister, became a Conservative MP and later (as first Baron Parmoor) a Labour cabinet minister. His mother was the sister of Beatrice Potter, who became Beatrice Webb. But for Stafford Cripps these political connections were, in his early years, much less significant than his parents' strong Christian values. His mother died suddenly when he was four; in line with her express wishes, he and his siblings were brought up to be &#145;undogmatic and unsectarian&#146;  (Estorick, 21) in their faith, and to take their religious inspiration directly from the spirit of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandthelaw"></a>Early life and the law</h2>Cripps's high intelligence and capacity for hard work showed itself early. After attending preparatory schools at Reigate and Rottingdean, he moved on to Winchester College. He won a scholarship to New College, Oxford, in 1907, the first ever offered in chemistry. But instead of taking it up, he was persuaded by Professor Sir William Ramsay to study at University College, London. Cripps once more excelled, taking the MSc degree and subsequently co-writing a research paper published under the auspices of the Royal Society. He was also personally popular, as shown by his election as president of the Student Union. But he was not quite the youthful paragon that biographers have made out. He enjoyed gambling, and, as he later admitted, exaggerated his own illnesses in order to gain sympathy.<br>
<br>During the first general election of 1910, when helping out with his father's campaign in South Buckinghamshire, he met Isobel Swithinbank (1891&#150;1979) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30983/', "Cripps, Dame Isobel")</script>], whom he married on 12 July the following year, and with whom he had four children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51813/', "Sir John Stafford Cripps")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97035/', "Peggy Appiah")</script>. He later accounted for his presence at the Conservative headquarters by saying that at this time he was &#145;almost entirely politically unconscious&#146;  (Estorick, 43&#150;4). In fact, he was politically ambivalent. A patriotic, anti-Liberal imperialist, he was none the less sympathetic to the plight of &#145;the poor slum-beings&#146;  (diary, 26 July 1910, Cripps MSS) and had occasional emotional spasms in the direction of socialism. But he did not have any clear idea of how the problem of poverty could be solved, and he retained many strong conservative instincts, for example, against the suffragettes.<br>
<br>His career was to be made in the law. He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1913, but his progress was interrupted by the outbreak of war in August 1914. Still under medical treatment from a breakdown he had suffered in June, Stafford did not join up, accepting the view that married men were not yet needed. But he did become an active recruiter and in October crossed to France on a freelance mission to deliver winter comforts to the troops. Once there he determined on joining the Red Cross, and soon became driver of a lorry which Isobel persuaded her father to donate. After twelve months' arduous but unskilled ambulance service, evacuating wounded men through Boulogne, Cripps offered his expertise as a chemist to the newly created Ministry of Munitions, and was posted to Queensferry, near Chester. Here, during the illness of the superintendent in the early months of 1916, he took on full responsibility for one of the biggest munitions factories in Great Britain and worked very long hours. He consequently suffered a more significant physical breakdown, eventually diagnosed as colitis (inflammation of the colon), and spent much of the rest of the war as an invalid.<br>
<br>This may have served to inhibit his inclination towards the Labour Party, given his sensitivity about his enforced dependence on unearned income. He noted: &#145;I could never go into Political life as a representative of Labour, being myself one who toils not neither does he spin!&#146;  (diary, 5 Oct 1918, Cripps MSS). After he returned to the bar in 1919, he thus concentrated his surplus effort not on politics but on religious work, most especially for the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches, of which he became treasurer. Work at the bar was initially slack, and the purchase and refurbishment of his country house, Goodfellows, in Gloucestershire, put him under financial strain. But his career soon took off, aided by an appearance for the London county council before the railway rates tribunal in 1924&#150;6, and he became Britain's youngest king's counsel in 1927.<h2>
<a name="Entryintopolitics"></a>Entry into politics</h2>Cripps's work before the tribunal had brought him to the attention of Herbert Morrison, the Labour leader in London. In 1929, with Morrison's encouragement, Cripps joined the Labour Party, now in office, and was soon adopted as prospective parliamentary candidate for West Woolwich. In 1930, however, he accepted an invitation to join Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government immediately as solicitor-general; he received the customary knighthood and in January 1931 won a by-election at Bristol East. Parachuted into a safe seat as a front-bencher, Cripps quickly showed strong parliamentary ability. When MacDonald formed the National Government in August 1931, he invited Cripps to continue as solicitor-general. Cripps declined politely, and, after the government's landslide election victory in October, was one of only three ministers from the previous administration left on the Labour benches in the Commons. Thrown into political prominence, he quickly became intimate with the other two, George Lansbury and Clement Attlee, who became party leader and deputy leader respectively. But the Commons atmosphere made him uncomfortable and he became a teetotaller &#145;as a protest against the alcoholism&#146; of the Parliamentary Labour Party  (Beatrice Webb, diary, 2 Sept 1934, Passfield MSS, BLPES). Although his initial impetus towards Labour had been born of the desire to act as a moderating influence, he now swung sharply to the left. The risk of isolation was mitigated, however, when he deployed his legal skills, without asking a fee, on behalf of the miners in the inquiry into the Gresford colliery disaster of 1934.<br>
<br>As a prominent member of the newly formed Socialist League (and, after 1933, as its chairman), Cripps attempted to rally Labour's rank and file against the &#145;reactionary&#146; policy of the trade unions and the party's national executive. He made numerous extreme statements, suggesting, for example, that a future socialist government would be unlikely &#145;to maintain its position of control without adopting some exceptional means such as the prolongation of the life of Parliament for a further term without an election&#146;  (Cripps, &#145;Can socialism come by constitutional methods?&#146;, in Addison and others, 39). He described the League of Nations as an &#145;International Burglars Union&#146;  (<span class="italic">Labour Party Annual Conference Report</span>, 1935, 158)&#151;a position which even the Soviet ambassador wanted him to moderate&#151;and, although he bitterly opposed appeasement of Germany, he refused until 1938 to countenance rearmament. This was because he supposed the National Government &#145;far more likely to be the allies of Fascism than the allies of Russia or any working-class country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 18 Feb 1937). The German take-over of Austria and, in particular, the Munich crisis helped bring Cripps to the realization that, if war came, he would feel compelled to do whatever he thought he could for his country, whatever the political complexion of its government. In retrospect this appears as the beginning of his transition from the heedless (albeit well-heeled) class warrior of the 1930s to the detached national figure with cross-party authority that he would become later.<br>
<br>In the immediate term, however, Cripps seemed bound on a trajectory of political self-destruction. His advocacy of a &#145;united front&#146; with the Communist Party and the Independent Labour Party brought him onto a collision course with Labour's executive and led, in 1937, to the forcible winding up of the Socialist League. In January 1939, desperate to rid the country of the National Government, he put forward the idea of a &#145;popular front&#146;, now to include Liberals as well. He launched a highly personalized campaign to this end, in open defiance of the executive, which expelled him from the party. The annual party conference in May endorsed this decision by 2,100,000 votes to 402,000.<h2>
<a name="ThestartoftheSecondWorldWar19391940"></a>The start of the Second World War, 1939&#150;1940</h2>The outbreak of war in 1939 caught Cripps off guard. He immediately threw up his practice at the bar and offered the government his services, presumptively in a technical or administrative role. With this offer spurned, and driven by a conviction that India, China, Russia, and the USA were the countries of the future, Cripps decided to embark on a world tour, undertaken with a young colleague, Geoffrey Wilson. In India Cripps was warmly received as the friend of Jawaharlal Nehru, an exact contemporary with a provokingly similar background to Cripps's own. Though unofficial in status, Cripps's visit was undertaken with the cognizance of the India Office and was intended to explore the prospects of an agreed plan for progress towards Indian self-government. Encouraged by his reception, and undoubtedly benefiting to some extent from Nehru's good offices in securing this, Cripps evidently hoped to enlist Gandhi's influence, writing after their first meeting: &#145;I feel there is a much better chance of solution of the problem while he is still alive and in control than there will be if and when he goes&#146;  (diary, 20 Dec 1939, Cripps MSS). The viceroy and the India Office, however, remained unmoved.<br>
<br>From India, Cripps moved on to China, currently resisting Japanese invasion. He based himself for two months at the beginning of 1940 in Chungking (Chongqing), the nationalists' wartime headquarters, where he established some degree of rapport with their leader, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, whose influential wife apparently shared Cripps's reforming instincts. Indeed, Cripps was invited to stay on as a personal adviser to the generalissimo, an offer that briefly tempted him, although the nationalists' increasing friction with the communists was a problem that he could not ignore. From Chungking, Cripps launched his own exploratory visit to Moscow, where he was <i>persona grata</i> as a rare Western apologist for the Soviet Union's actions in recent months, in first concluding its pact with Germany and then occupying Finland. His meeting with the foreign minister, Molotov, was the first British contact since the withdrawal of the ambassador at the end of 1939. Cripps made a report to the foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, with whom he maintained good relations, though without achieving much impression.<br>
<br>Returning to London via the USA at the end of April 1940, Cripps resumed his efforts for what he called a government of national unity. Despite the fall of Chamberlain in May 1940, after a parliamentary debate on Norway to which Cripps had contributed critical comments, he found himself excluded from the Churchill coalition government, which was constructed on strict party lines. An official posting to the Soviet Union, however, was now offered by the Foreign Office, largely through the good offices of Halifax, supported by his junior minister, R. A. Butler.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadorinRussia19401942"></a>Ambassador in Russia, 1940&#150;1942</h2>Cripps served as British ambassador to the Soviet Union from June 1940 to January 1942. He left Goodfellows, now too large a commitment once his legal income was gone, and subsequently lived in a more modest but comfortable country home at Frith Hill, near Stroud; Isobel joined him in Moscow, with their daughters Peggy and Theresa, from October 1940 to June 1941. Cripps had initially been charged with a special mission limited to possible economic or strategic co-operation, but the Russians forced the hand of the British government by agreeing to accept him only provided he were a full ambassador. Exceptionally, he remained a member of parliament, thus permitting his easy re-entry to British politics at a moment of his choosing. After one introductory meeting with Molotov, Cripps found himself officially snubbed. With Britain fighting for its very survival, the Russians chose to keep their distance, especially from an ambassador in whom the Foreign Office establishment betrayed some lack of confidence.<br>
<br>Cripps saw himself as a major political figure with his own mission to accomplish&#151;to ease relations between Britain and Russia pending the eventual &#145;divorce&#146; between Hitler and Stalin&#151;and proposed an initiative over the status of the Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia). Their occupation by Russia struck Cripps as evidence of Russia's security worries rather than of its own imperialist expansion. In the middle of October 1940 Halifax persuaded the war cabinet to support the proposals that Cripps now put forward. His optimism was soon deflated with the announcement on 9 November that the elusive Molotov was off to Berlin for the first top-level talks since the signing of the Nazi&#150;Soviet pact, fifteen months previously. Having spent four months persuading the Foreign Office to offer concessions over the Baltic states, Cripps found that it could not abruptly be unpersuaded, even though by December his own line had changed. His critics erred, however, in putting down everything to &#145;disillusionment&#146;. He had written at the outset: &#145;One thing has been proved here&#151;so far&#151;and that is that you cannot leap into Utopia in one bound&#146;  (letter to his daughter Diana, 8 Sept 1940, Cripps MSS). But perhaps his realism about the Soviet Union became infused with a degree of cynicism. Correspondingly, his conviction that his own government was doing the right thing, if often in the wrong way, was strengthened.<br>
<br>One incident that has bulked disproportionately large is Churchill's charge that Cripps failed to ensure that Stalin received a personal warning of Hitler's plan (&#145;Barbarossa&#146;) to attack Russia. The fact is that Cripps long sought unavailingly to alert the Foreign Office to such a possibility, without appreciable success, and that Stalin had a range of much more circumstantial intelligence reports available, which he ignored.<br>
<br>Early in June 1941 Cripps was recalled to London, as a disciplinary step, since the Foreign Office had built up a formidable dossier against the behaviour of their eccentric ambassador. Vindication came with the launch of Barbarossa on 22 June. Churchill and Eden now found it easy to close ranks with Cripps, who was summoned at once to Chequers. The prime minister's broadcast that night, balancing emotion with realism in its support of Russia, tallied with Cripps's own analysis. On his return to Moscow, Cripps was joined by a British military mission, and an agreement on mutual assistance was finalized with unwonted speed. Its signature on 12 July was the high point of Cripps's diplomatic career. Though Cripps vigorously represented the demands of the Soviet government, he was by no means its creature. In economic negotiations, Cripps chided the Foreign Office as &#145;still imbued with the appeasement attitude and dont see that people respect you if you stand up to them in a dignified way&#146;  (diary, 11 Aug 1941). Cripps's tough tactics in handling the Russians went along with his strategy for forging a robust alliance of equals.<br>
<br>Successful in pressing for an Anglo-American conference with the Russians, as finally convened in Moscow at the end of September, Cripps found that the entire discussion of supplies for Russia was to be kept in the hands of the visiting dignitaries: the British minister of supply, Lord Beaverbrook, and the American roving ambassador, Averell Harriman. His personal treatment by Beaverbrook left Cripps wary of him as a colleague and, more important, deplorably under-informed about the course of discussions from which he had been excluded. Moreover, within days, the whole war situation deteriorated in ways that further marginalized Cripps, with the enforced evacuation of the embassy on 15 October to Kuibyshev, 530 miles to the east on the River Volga. Worst of all, though the diplomatic corps was now in Kuibyshev, the Soviet government was not.<br>
<br>For the first time since going to Russia, Cripps looked hard at his own political prospects. His increasingly sharp clashes with Churchill had a political undertone of which both men were aware. Cripps now saw himself as a political exile, and submitted what was virtually his resignation. With Eden now about to visit Moscow, Cripps was browbeaten or charmed, yet again, into staying at his post. The Moscow talks, starting on 16 December, saw him as a participant throughout, flanking Eden and facing Stalin and Molotov. But, following the dramatic entry into the war of the USA, Churchill came to think Cripps a bigger menace in Russia than at home and sent permission for him to return to London, which he did in January 1942.<h2>
<a name="Churchillscolleague19421945"></a>Churchill's colleague, 1942&#150;1945</h2>Cripps was now widely hailed as the man who had brought Russia into the war. Churchill, his own position weakened by a string of British set-backs, notably the fall of Singapore, sought to conciliate Cripps, and in late February 1942 brought him into the government as lord privy seal and leader of the House of Commons. A novice in the war cabinet, Cripps had neither a strong department nor a secure party base&#151;only the evanescent support of public opinion. He chose to invest his windfall political capital in an initiative to break the political impasse in India, now a crucial theatre of war in the path of Japanese advance.<br>
<br>Cripps exploited US pressure to secure Churchill's reluctant agreement to the &#145;Cripps offer&#146;. This was a promise of self-government for India via a post-war constituent assembly, subject only to the right of any province not to accede. Only a month after joining the war cabinet, Cripps flew out to Delhi. There he threw himself into a whirlwind of negotiation, in order to win consent from all sections of Indian opinion, reporting nightly to a sceptical viceroy (the second marquess of Linlithgow). Within days Gandhi's aphorism&#151;that the Cripps offer was &#145;a post-dated cheque&#146;&#151;was in circulation. What Cripps offered was not only a post-war promise, however, but a substantial payment on account in the form of an immediate approximation to cabinet government. There were two provisos: that strategic defence issues would remain in British hands for the duration of the war and that the viceroy's co-operation in operating the new conventions would be forthcoming.<br>
<br>The Muslim League under Mohamed Ali Jinnah was ready to accept the package, provided that Congress would too. Here agreement seemed tantalizingly close, the more so after intervention from President Roosevelt's representative in Delhi, Colonel Louis Johnson, who helped Cripps devise a formula on defence acceptable to Nehru and the Congress president, Abul Kalam Azad. Only Linlithgow failed to co-operate; but this proved enough to undermine Congress's faith in Cripps's assurances about how the conventions of cabinet responsibility would be operated by the viceroy. It was this, rather than sharp practice on Cripps's part or sabotage from London, that doomed the Cripps mission.<br>
<br>The aftermath of the Cripps mission was piquant. The political vacuum was filled by Gandhi's Quit India campaign, soon accepted by Congress. Conversely, Cripps saw the opportunity to redeem his disappointment in Delhi by a propaganda triumph, aimed particularly at the USA, with the aim of unmasking Gandhi as the cause of failure. One result of the Cripps mission, then, was to embitter attitudes in India, not least towards Cripps himself, while influential sections of American opinion swung to a less critical view of British policy. In this respect, Churchill owed a substantial, if largely unacknowledged, debt to Cripps.<br>
<br>Their working relationship in the war cabinet was not happy. Cripps chafed under a regime which he considered inefficient, while his own talents were largely wasted as leader of the house, a role in which he was weakened by his lack of either party allegiance or political finesse. That he seriously thought that he could displace Churchill remains unlikely, but he showed himself prepared to risk his career in an attempt to remodel the structure of government. Failing to carry his proposals by the autumn of 1942, Cripps patriotically deferred his resignation while the military outcome in the north African desert remained in doubt. Once the victory at El Alamein had strengthened Churchill's hand, a reinvigorated prime minister was ready for a showdown with Cripps, who left the war cabinet in November, accepting the less glamorous post of minister of aircraft production.<br>
<br>Cripps's dedication and powers of rapid comprehension suited him well for the technical tasks that faced him at his new ministry, in spite of early clashes with its highly able chief executive, Sir Wilfrid Freeman. Cripps's time at the Ministry of Aircraft Production alerted him to the complexities of industrial planning. In contrast to his pre-war dogmatism, he now became convinced of the need for varying degrees of nationalization and control in different industries. One significant innovation was the idea of joint production committees of workers and employers, an experiment in industrial democracy which contributed to his new-found belief in &#145;democratic planning&#146;, dependent for its success on all social classes working together voluntarily in the national interest. It was this kind of emphasis on common efforts to tackle economic problems that became his great theme upon his return to the Labour Party in 1945. Appointed president of the Board of Trade by Attlee after Labour's victory of that year, his emphasis on collective self-denial&#151;by restraining consumption to promote economic recovery&#151;made his name a byword for austerity.<h2>
<a name="ThetransferofpowerinIndia19461947"></a>The transfer of power in India, 1946&#150;1947</h2>For eighteen months the Board of Trade had to compete for Cripps's attention with India, now being extricated from the thralls of empire. It is striking here how far the historiography has diminished Cripps's role. For it was Cripps who arguably offered India its last chance to avert partition and bloodshed, as Indian politicians as diverse as Vallabhbhai Patel and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari came to appreciate. From March to June 1946 Cripps made his third and longest visit to India charged with seeking agreement on the transfer of power from Britain to an independent government. Though part of a cabinet delegation with two colleagues (Lord Pethick-Lawrence as secretary of state and Albert Alexander as first lord of the Admiralty), Cripps was seen as the man in charge.<br>
<br>It was Gandhi's proven ability to thwart a settlement that made his position pivotal. Cripps decided that no trouble was to be spared in courting him, despite the qualms of the viceroy, Lord Wavell, who sat with the ministers through protracted formal meetings with all parties. Cripps saw the alternatives starkly: either a negotiated settlement or bloodshed. When the talks adjourned to Simla, in the cool of the hills, hopes of a rapprochement between Nehru and Jinnah seemed to blossom, only to be blighted by a sudden frost. Back in Delhi, everyone waited instead upon an initiative from Cripps.<br>
<br>The cabinet delegation's statement of 16 May was essentially Cripps's attempt to build on the measure of agreement revealed at Simla and to erect this into a system of government. His strategy was to accommodate the Muslim demand for some kind of self-government by means of a three-tier structure, in which provinces could opt for grouping at an intermediate level below that of a union of all India, which would be responsible for certain common functions, including defence. The underlying problem was that Congress found the notion of grouping repugnant, and therefore refused to grant it the sort of legitimacy necessary to entice the Muslim League into such constitutional arrangements. Within days of this statement, Cripps faced a crisis that was both political and personal. Having set great store by gaining Gandhi's approval, Cripps suddenly found that he could not rely upon it; and his own physical collapse at this point was hardly coincidental. On his sickbed Cripps sent a personal appeal to Gandhi, only to find it rebuffed with a clear imputation on his probity.<br>
<br>Securing the Muslim League's acceptance of a scheme for an all-India union was actually the cabinet delegation's greatest achievement. Despite the league's commitment to Pakistan, it was induced into a constitutional scheme providing for a united India&#151;on certain conditions, the most important of which was a recognition of grouping. Cripps trusted Congress to make a reality of that inducement; the league soon concluded that the behaviour of the Congress leaders left it with no basis for such trust, and thus with no reason to compromise its own aim of Pakistan. At the time neither Nehru nor Patel, much to Cripps's exasperation, was prepared to counter Gandhi's influence, which was crucial in determining this outcome. Wavell, for his part, blamed Cripps for dishonesty and duplicity in accepting Congress's qualified assurances as consent. The issue was really how far political finesse could be justified in brokering a messy compromise from which each side naturally hoped to gain different advantages. Like early steps in any peace process, the cabinet delegation's scheme did not tie up all the historically generated loose ends at once, but opened the way to incremental co-operation in creating, building, and sustaining trust.<br>
<br>The fact that the crux of the whole issue now lay within the ambit of Indian politics was recognized by Cripps. By the end of 1946 Indian policy had reached an impasse which was broken only when Attlee made a striking move: the appointment of the glamorous figure of Admiral Lord Mountbatten as the last viceroy (in place of Wavell), combined with setting a date for British withdrawal. It was not, contrary to his later claims, Mountbatten himself who imposed a deadline for British withdrawal; at most he tinkered with the date itself. Attlee had already fixed on this plan by the time he decided to appoint Mountbatten, as is now generally accepted. But the records suggest that this proposal actually came from Cripps, who was also largely responsible for bringing forward the name of Mountbatten, to whose subsequent efforts he gave unwavering support throughout the transfer of power in 1947.<h2>
<a name="Economicsupremo19471950"></a>Economic supremo, 1947&#150;1950</h2>Getting back into his stride at the Board of Trade, Cripps emerged as an increasingly strong figure in an increasingly beleaguered government. He introduced legislation which allowed the creation of development councils, intended to facilitate &#145;tripartite&#146; co-operation between government, employers, and workers at an industry-wide level, although the innovation proved largely unsuccessful. He also played a key role in drafting the landmark <span class="italic">Economic Survey for 1947</span>, a government white paper in which he reiterated his belief that planning should be reconciled to the maximum possible extent with free individual choice.<br>
<br>The fuel and convertibility crises of 1947, however, contributed to a sense that the government was drifting, perhaps sinking. Eager to see control restored, Cripps attempted that September to replace Attlee with Ernest Bevin as prime minister. Attlee coolly faced Cripps down, offering him instead a new post as minister for economic affairs, independent of the Treasury, and responsible for economic planning. Cripps accepted, but the arrangement lasted only six weeks. Hugh Dalton resigned as chancellor after a budget leak, and Cripps replaced him, while retaining the economic affairs portfolio&#151;a unique concentration of authority in determining economic policy.<br>
<br>Cripps's priorities were: exports first, capital investment second, and the needs, comforts, and amenities of ordinary consumers last. However, his belief in &#145;democratic planning&#146; made him reluctant to achieve his ends via compulsion, so he increasingly relied on exhortation, both of workers and employers. This had some notable results, in particular the Trades Union Congress's acceptance of a two-year wage freeze after 1948. But, as the war-weary public's forbearance dimmed, it was hardly surprising that this proved to be a strategy of progressively diminishing returns. Moreover, owing to the inadequacies of its propaganda, the government had difficulty getting its message across.<br>
<br>Cripps and his colleagues had, then, failed to create the detailed and effective system of physical planning that Labour thinkers had envisaged before 1945. It was logical, therefore, to try another policy&#151;a less <i>dirigiste</i> form of economic control based on the restraint of aggregate demand. Cripps thus deliberately and explicitly achieved large budgetary surpluses as a means to this end; his 1948 budget is generally considered a landmark of applied Keynesianism. Arguably the real architects of this policy were two of Cripps's key officials, Edwin Plowden and Robert Hall. Hall believed that Cripps's skill as a barrister enabled him to make more of the arguments of his subordinates than they ever would themselves, leading to the paradoxical judgement: &#145;He did not really understand the basis of economic planning as we developed it under his regime, but he was entirely responsible for its development&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hall Diaries</span>, 222). Never a bookish man, Cripps had neither read Keynes nor assimilated his theoretical analysis.<br>
<br>The chancellor's authority was undermined by the devaluation crisis of 1949. The decision to devalue sterling&#151;which Cripps announced on 17 September&#151;was in fact taken by a triumvirate of less senior ministers, approved by the cabinet, and conveyed to him in Z&uuml;rich, where he was convalescing. He acquiesced, although he was by no means convinced of the rightness of the action. The episode also led to a breach with Churchill, who accused Cripps of dishonesty, given that he had previously stated that devaluation would not take place. Cripps, of course, had had little other option.<br>
<br>Now gravely ill, and with his reputation damaged, Cripps found his macroeconomic strategy being increasingly questioned by his colleagues, including even the prime minister. The most serious challenge came from Hugh Gaitskell, who had played a key role in the decision to devalue. Early in 1950 Gaitskell wrote a memorandum that criticized the tendency to move from direct physical controls to indirect budgetary methods of economic management. This view won wide support from other ministers, and Cripps was obliged to endorse Gaitskell's general line. This is not to say that there was any immediate threat to Cripps's position; but, with Gaitskell emerging as an obvious successor, Cripps was no longer clearly indispensable.<h2>
<a name="Finalillness"></a>Final illness</h2>Sickness finally forced Cripps's resignation, both as chancellor and as an MP; this was announced on 20 October 1950. He travelled to his habitual retreat, the Bircher Benner clinic in Z&uuml;rich, and also received treatment in Lausanne. Not only was he suffering from tubercular spondylitis, a spinal infection, but he also developed stomach tumours and was later diagnosed as having a form of bone marrow cancer, which ultimately proved fatal. He put up a remarkable physical fight, and in the autumn of 1951 was briefly able to return to Britain. A relapse early in 1952 compelled him to go back to Switzerland; he died at the Bircher Benner clinic, Keltenstrasse 48, Z&uuml;rich, on 21 April of that year, and was cremated in Z&uuml;rich three days later.<br>
<br>There were many contradictions or at least paradoxes. Latterly Cripps's public image was constructed, especially through the press, in ways that positively emphasized his leadership potential during the war but rebounded negatively against him afterwards. In the 1940s his lean appearance, his rimless spectacles, his well-known vegetarianism, and his teetotalism contributed to an impression of asceticism; and he ultimately gave up his only &#145;vice&#146;, heavy smoking, on doctor's orders. Yet Cripps had another side&#151;personally warm and privately tolerant&#151;which suggests that he was no narrow-minded killjoy. It was a major propaganda coup for the Conservatives to suggest that post-war privations were imposed on the hard-pressed British people not through necessity but through choice: that Cripps as economic supremo relished the hair-shirt measures that he preached with such high-minded fervour. In death as in life, his reputation hinged on one inescapable word: austerity.<br>
<br>Cripps was a man from a background of established wealth, who gave up an income of &pound;30,000 a year in 1939; whose early political career was as a prominent left-wing rebel and fellow-traveller of the communists. Conversely, in the 1940s he emerged as a central figure in the establishment of a new post-war consensus, especially in economic policy. His wartime role as ambassador in Moscow propelled him into the top rank of British politics, alone able to rival Churchill as a wartime leader, albeit briefly and perhaps not wholly deservedly. Yet Cripps's insight into the great unresolved problem of India was far less blinkered and flawed than that of Churchill, and here Cripps surely deserved better for his tireless commitment in pursuit of a peaceful resolution of the impasse. In many ways he is remembered for the wrong reasons.<br>
