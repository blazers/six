<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marshall,  Arthur  Calder-</span>  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 19 August 1908 at El Misti, Woodcote Road, Wallington, Surrey, the second of two sons of Arthur Grotjan Calder-Marshall, a civil engineer, and Alice Poole. After a peripatetic childhood, following his father's career, the family settled at Steyning, Sussex, when Calder-Marshall was fifteen. He depicts his rebellious and questing adolescence there in his partial autobiography, <span class="italic">The Magic of my Youth</span> (1951). This centres on his friendship with an individual named Vickybird or the Poet (the otherwise unnamed Victor Neuburg) and on the then infamous occultist Aleister Crowley, whom he records as a thoroughly seedy and disillusioning character.<br>
<br>Calder-Marshall attended St Paul's School, London, before going up to Hertford College, Oxford. As secretary of the Oxford University Poetry Society, he invited Crowley to come and speak in 1930. He was fascinated by the idea of anyone so reassuringly evil &#145;in a world where blacks and whites were breaking up so fast into various shades of grey&#146;  (Calder-Marshall, <span class="italic">The Magic of my Youth</span>, 177). This became the scandalous &#145;banned lecture&#146; on Gilles de Rais, which was not allowed to take place and was instead printed as a notoriously boring pamphlet. Like so many of his class and generation, Calder-Marshall did an early stint of schoolmastering, teaching from 1931 to 1933 at Denstone College, a minor public school. His misgivings about the public-school system, and indeed about English bourgeois society and capitalism as a whole, were later expressed in his Hogarth Press pamphlet, <span class="italic">Challenge to Schools</span> (1935). Calder-Marshall became a full-time writer in 1933, and during the 1930s he was a productive experimental novelist whose strong leftward views were in tune with the era that he looked back on ruefully in his 1941 <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> article &#145;The pink decade&#146;.<br>
<br>Calder-Marshall's contribution to the &#145;Writing in revolt&#146; issue of <span class="italic">Fact</span> (no. 4, 1937) was something of a manifesto for non-bourgeois writing. In contrast with bourgeois literature's emphasis on the individual, Calder-Marshall believed, the progressive writer should depict society as a whole, for which he advocated some form of &#145;the composite method&#146; as found in the work of John Dos Passos and others. Calder-Marshall admired Dos Passos for his democratic vitality and formal boldness, such as the incorporation of &#145;newsreel&#146; sections into <span class="italic">USA</span>.<br>
<br>In accordance with this, Calder-Marshall's early fiction attempted to find composite forms for a more interpersonal, collective, and socially conscious writing, focusing on relationships and institutions rather than on the subjectivity of the individual character. <span class="italic">About Levy</span> (1933) consists of forty-odd sketches and vignettes&#151;two washerwomen talking, some men in a pub, a judge addressing a jury, and so on&#151;which add up, with a little work from the reader, to the story of a sympathetic Jewish doctor accused of murder. <span class="italic">Dead Centre</span> (1935) anatomizes the life of a public school through sixty-odd short chapters, each narrated by different boys and masters. Calder-Marshall's methods are those of an era when both cinematic montage and the Mass-Observation movement of Charles Madge and his associates were very much in the consciousness of writers and intellectuals.<br>
<br>On 6 July 1934 Calder-Marshall married Violet Nancy (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of Benjamin Sales, a director of a manufacturing chemist's. They had two daughters. Calder-Marshall became a Hollywood scriptwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1937. During the war he was employed by the British Petroleum warfare department and, from 1942 to 1945, by the films division of the Ministry of Information. In 1946 he wrote the screenplay for the award-winning Paul Rotha documentary <span class="italic">The World is Rich</span>. After the war he branched into writing biographies, including that of the pioneering sexologist Havelock Ellis. One biography in particular, <span class="italic">No Earthly Command</span> (1957), the life of Vice-Admiral Alexander Riall Wadham Woods DSO, was a turning point in Calder-Marshall's own life. During the battle of Jutland, while he was signals officer to the admiral of the Grand Fleet, Woods allegedly received an &#145;interposed message&#146; instructing him to serve God, and he ended his life as a poor parson working with down-and-outs in the East End of London.<br>
<br>Having initially been cynical about the commission to write Woods's biography, which came from an American film producer, Calder-Marshall came to believe while researching it that Woods was praying for him from heaven, and the book became the emotive story of Calder-Marshall's own conversion to Christianity. It is possible that Calder-Marshall felt this religious change independently, to some extent, and that he chose to dramatize it in the biography project.<br>
<br>Calder-Marshall continued to write fiction, and <span class="italic">The Scarlet Boy</span> (1961) is often considered to be his finest novel, exploring the effects on a group of people of a house haunted by two boys who have committed suicide. As in <span class="italic">No Earthly Command</span>, the narrator finds his own character and beliefs changing as he tries to report events.<br>
<br>Calder-Marshall wrote many documentary film scripts, a play, three books for children, and several fictions under the pseudonym of William Drummond, as well as editing editions of Thomas Paine and Jack London, among others. Notable later non-fiction includes <span class="italic">Wish you Were Here: the Art of Donald McGill</span> (1966), about the saucy seaside postcard artist, and <span class="italic">Prepare to Shed them now: the Ballads of George R. Sims</span> (1968), which comprises a substantial introduction to the life of the social reformer and sentimental balladeer who wrote &#145;Christmas Day in the Workhouse&#146;. Calder-Marshall's <span class="italic">Lewd, blasphemous and obscene: being the trials and tribulations of sundry founding fathers of today's alternative societies</span> (1972) revives a clutch of Victorian free-speech controversies, framed by the contemporary <span class="italic">Oz</span> magazine obscenity trial.<br>
<br>Calder-Marshall's move away from thirties leftism towards the Christian faith was underpinned by unchanging ethical concerns. His 1930s work has dated to some extent, but the best of his later fiction has an enduring psychological and moral finesse. However, his most enduring work may well be <span class="italic">The Magic of my Youth</span>, a minor classic of English autobiography. Shrewdly intelligent, his best non-fiction has an unusual combination of down-to-earth social awareness and steady moral concern, together with a wit and an urbanity of a kind that is not prominent in academic cultural studies. About 5 feet 9 inches tall with a stocky build, Calder-Marshall was, as his daughter Anna recalled, &#145;a Spencer Tracy type when young. As he grew older, his sandy hair went a lovely grey. He had very blue eyes &hellip; and a deep voice. He gave off goodness&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Arthur Calder-Marshall lived latterly at Twickenham, and died at the William Harvey Hospital at Ashford, Kent, on 17 April 1992.<br>
