<span class="headword">Nolan,  Anthony Edward</span>  (1971&#150;1979), <span class="occ">inspiration of a medical charity</span>, was born at the Memorial Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia, on 2 December 1971, the only son of <a name="cosubject_77062"></a><span class="headword">Shirley Nolan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Oakey]</span></span>  (1942&#150;2002). She had been born at the Maternity Hospital Annexe, Cookridge, Leeds, on 10 February 1942, the daughter of George Henry Oakey, then serving as a lance-corporal in the Royal Army Service Corps, and his wife, Rhoda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Unsworth, bus conductor. She had an elder brother Bob and a younger brother Tony. Before the Second World War her father had been a tailor's fitter; later he was a chemical worker. She was educated at Pontefract Girls' High School and Trent Park College, Hertfordshire, before being awarded an associateship at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London. She married James Gerald Nolan on 4 August 1962, when he was thirty-one and working as a scaffolder. He was the son of Thomas Nolan, a janitor. She began teaching in 1963 in Harlow New Town, Essex, and in 1965 was head of drama at a school in Rainham, Essex. In 1969 Shirley decided to travel overland to Australia, accompanied, according to her autobiography, by a man named Ted whom she had met shortly beforehand. They arrived in Darwin, Northern Territory, in November 1969 and settled there, Ted running a delivery business and Shirley teaching literature. They moved to Adelaide, South Australia, in November 1971.<br>
<br>Within hours of his birth Anthony Nolan suffered the first of countless haemorrhages. Following many periods of critical illness, he was diagnosed as suffering from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare bone marrow disease which incapacitated his immune system. These early months established the pattern which continued throughout his life. Shirley Nolan dedicated her entire life to him, battling without ceasing for his life, praying but only occasionally being sure her prayers were heard, and fluctuating as to whether she was fighting simply for him to live, or for him to lead a life better than she could give him without treatment. Her own mother proved a tireless help to Anthony throughout his life; Ted gave financial support in the early stages and later donated blood in the search for a successful treatment.<br>
<br>Since no suitable donor of bone marrow could be found for Anthony among blood relatives, his disease was diagnosed as incurable, but a successful transplant using bone marrow from a non-relative in 1973 offered new hope. Shirley took Anthony to London in August 1973 hoping to find a donor, but discovered that there was no register of tissue-typed potential donors. She decided to found one, and, ending the strict ban on publicity to which she had previously agreed, launched a public campaign to raise money. In 1974 she was able to establish the Anthony Nolan register at Westminster Children's Hospital, supported by the pathologist John Hobbs and the tissue-typing expert David James. Financial backing from well-wishers, notably the Round Table charity, enabled the expensive and complex tissue-typing to proceed. In 1978 the register moved to St Mary Abbots Hospital, Kensington, where the Anthony Nolan laboratory was opened.<br>
<br>The striking success of the fund-raising campaign contrasted with the daily struggle to keep Anthony alive. Shirley and Anthony lived in the Westminster Children's Hospital from August to December 1973, her mother spending hours each day there. The three then moved to Thanet, Kent, and in 1975 to Challock, Kent. In these two cottages Shirley Nolan sought to create a safe environment for Anthony, who frequently haemorrhaged, and was anaemic and so vulnerable to infection that he could not play with children, animals, or any adult who might be infectious. Ted remained in Australia and his visit in May 1975 marked the effective end of Shirley's and his partnership, though towards the end of her life they again became closer. While lack of contact with others kept Anthony alive, it left him frustrated and on occasion very disturbed, though publicity photographs of him smiling captured moments of genuine happiness. His physical appearance fluctuated dramatically with his health and with the drugs he was taking, but the effects of steroids ensured that he never grew much beyond toddler stature and gave him chubby cheeks, both of which were captured in engaging photographs.<br>
<br>The struggle to keep Anthony alive while fund-raising tirelessly took its toll on Shirley. Unable to face the British winter of 1977&#150;8 and wanting to rejoin her mother, who had gone to Australia to comfort her son Bob whose only son had just died there, Shirley and Anthony Nolan moved back to South Australia, settling first in the country and then in Adelaide. In 1978 she decided to allow Anthony to mix with other children, and he greatly enjoyed attending school and daily tasks such as shopping. In January 1979 this happy period ended when Shirley decided to take Anthony back to London, where the possibility of &#145;manufacturing&#146; compatible donor marrow using material from various family members seemed to offer a way round the continuing failure to find a single suitable donor for him. The effort, however, failed, and Anthony died on 21 October 1979 at the Westminster Children's Hospital, London, aged seven, from a cerebral haemorrhage like those he had suffered since birth. Later in 1979 Shirley Nolan published a book telling Anthony's story, <span class="italic">A Kiss through Glass</span>. After his death she continued her work in his name. In 1988 the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust was established and after 1996 the Anthony Nolan Research Institute undertook research on bone marrow transplants and related questions from two well-equipped laboratories funded by the trust. By 2002, 3500 donors had been found for transplants through the work of the trust, which by then maintained a register of 330,000 tissue-typed volunteers. One of the largest such databases and the model for some fifty registers around the world, its staff co-ordinated all UK patient searches on overseas registers, giving sufferers access to information on seven million potential donors.<br>
<br>Shirley Nolan returned to Adelaide after Anthony's death but continued her involvement with the trust, being appointed OBE in 2000 in recognition of her work. Tragically she was diagnosed as suffering from Parkinson's disease at the age of only thirty-nine, and the effects of the disease and its treatment left her, in her words, &#145;hopelessly&#146;, though not terminally, ill. She joined the South Australia Voluntary Euthanasia Society (SAVES) and campaigned for the legalization of assisted death. On 3 December 2001 she made her first attempt at suicide but, in her words, &#145;botched it&#146;, being discovered by ambulance staff and resuscitated against her clear written wishes. She was denied painkillers thereafter to try to prevent a recurrence. Her second attempt at suicide succeeded and she died on 14 July 2002 having injected herself with a variety of drugs at her home at 10 Lema Avenue, Fairview Park, South Australia. She was cremated at the Northern Region crematorium, Gawler. Relatives, friends, and campaigners complained angrily to the press that they knew she planned suicide, yet could not be with her for fear that they would be implicated in her death. Shirley Nolan left her personal papers to SAVES to be used to further its work. SAVES named 31 March 2004 Shirley Nolan day, marked by a rally to promote the cause of assisted death. Two months later, in May 2004, the first Shirley Nolan lecturer spoke of lives saved by advances in bone marrow transplants.<br>
<br>In two powerful letters published in newspapers around the world after her death, Shirley Nolan named &#145;the gift of life&#146; &#145;the greatest gift of all&#146;, yet claimed &#145;the right to die&#151;with dignity&#146;, while speaking bitterly against those who blocked (stem cell) research into neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. While the poignancy of Shirley Nolan's lonely suicide aroused the sympathy of the public, her outspoken statements connecting the right to life, the right to death, the right to have and to refuse treatment, and the right to the fruits of stem cell research (which seemed likely to help sufferers from her and her son's conditions) captured the complexity of moral questions often oversimplified by single-issue pressure groups.<br>
