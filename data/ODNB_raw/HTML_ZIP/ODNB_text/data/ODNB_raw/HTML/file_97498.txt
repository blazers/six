<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kneale,  (Thomas) Nigel</span>  (1922&#150;2006), <span class="occ">television dramatist</span>, was born on 28 April 1922 at Risedale Maternity Home, Barrow in Furness, Lancashire, the elder son of William Thomas Kneale (1896&#150;1963), journalist, and his wife, Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kewley (1889&#150;1979). Both parents were natives of the Isle of Man, in exile at 74 Market Street, Dalton in Furness, while Kneale's father gained experience locally as a reporter. When Kneale was five they returned to the island capital, Douglas, in 1927, for William Kneale to join <span class="italic">Mona's Herald</span>, the newspaper that he would edit and eventually own. From junior school in Murray's Road, he went to Douglas High School for Boys, leaving at seventeen to be articled to an advocate. He found this uninteresting, and also rather limiting in that Manx law is not applicable elsewhere in Britain. And though he loved the island, especially the coast around Peel where his grandfather had a farm, its combination of wind and sun was already causing him discomfort. &#145;The sun and I are enemies&#146;, he would say. Whether or not this aversion was a factor, he was found medically unfit for military service in the Second World War.<br>
<br>In his spare time Kneale&#151;known to family and friends as Tom, but more widely as Nigel&#151;was writing stories. In 1942 he had his first magazine acceptance, and on a visit to London the following year was invited by Collins to assemble a collection for a book, though in the end it was six years before they published it. Meanwhile he failed to sit his final law exam, &#145;for fear of passing it,&#146; he claimed, and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). This was partly because he fancied being an actor, but also with a view to writing for the theatre or the screen. Next came two years carrying a spear at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford upon Avon, while continuing to pursue his writing ambitions. His volume of short stories for Collins, <span class="italic">Tomato Cain</span>, finally emerged in 1949. They were terse, imaginative, even weird: a wartime airman lost in the desert wanders into the palace of the Sleeping Beauty, or (in the title story) an island vegetable grower seeks to prohibit the cultivation of alien tomatoes, only to succeed in ridiculing himself. The book earned its author the Somerset Maugham award of 1950, but his earnings remained irregular, with spells back in the Isle of Man whenever he was hard up.<br>
<br>Then in 1951 came a lucky meeting with Michael Barry, who had been one of Kneale's tutors at RADA, and was now head of drama for the BBC's fledgling television service. Anxious to improve on the worn-out stage plays that accounted for much of the output, Barry hired Kneale as a staff writer. As there was no provision for such a post, he had to be paid out of the petty cash. Finally, authority was given to set up a script unit, &#145;although most of the money made available&#146;, the BBC's historian Asa Briggs acidly recorded, &#145;went to one man, Nigel Kneale&#146;  (Briggs, 689).<br>
<br>Much of the work that came Kneale's way was still adaptation from established sources, along with furnishing dialogue for children's puppet series. When, however, at a department meeting to make plans for 1953, he urged a venture into science fiction, not only was this accepted, but he was assigned to write it. The producer would be Rudolph Cartier, which was ideal casting. Viennese by birth, Cartier had worked with Max Reinhardt and at the Universum Film studios in Berlin before fleeing from the Nazis. His creed for television was to disregard the limitations of a tiny studio, cumbersome cameras, and live transmission, and attempt the impossible. <span class="italic">The Quatermass Experiment</span> (1953), a six-part serial about an astronaut returning to earth infected with the spores of a disease that would turn him into a human vegetable, held the nation agog. Yet the backdrop to the macabre climax in Westminster Abbey (chosen because it would be familiar to viewers from the coronation coverage earlier in the year) was simply a giant enlargement of an illustration in the abbey guidebook. Poking through it were Kneale's own hands in wash-leather gloves strung with noisome bits and pieces to represent the gruesome monster. Two further serials, <span class="italic">Quatermass II</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Quatermass and the Pit</span> (1958&#150;9), pursued the theme of advances in science whose implications only Kneale's hero, Professor Bernard Quatermass, seemed to grasp.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1954, Kneale and Cartier had also collaborated on a brilliant realization of George Orwell's <span class="italic">1984</span>. A torture scene with live rats raised an outcry and a foolish demand in parliament that the customary repeat performance be cancelled, but the BBC held firm, and Michael Barry personally introduced the broadcast. On 8 May the same year Kneale married (Anne) Judith Kerr (<i>b</i>. 1923), daughter of a refugee German critic, Alfred Kerr, and sister of the lawyer Sir Michael Kerr. She became a lauded children's author and illustrator. They had a son, Matthew, a writer, and a daughter, Tracy, a painter.<br>
<br>Kneale's own career was, however, advancing a little uncertainly. Cinema versions of his Quatermass epics from Hammer (1956, 1957, and 1967) were low-budget, and looked it. Moreover, in the first two a &#145;tough guy&#146; American, Brian Donlevy, was cast as the supposedly wise and cerebral professor. Only <span class="italic">Quatermass and the Pit</span>, with the Scottish actor Andrew Keir replacing Donlevy, had much of the force of the original. Kneale, ironically, was winning plaudits at this time with his screenplays for films far removed from his usual flights, including John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1958) and then <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (1960). But worlds to come or latent terrors from the past were still the stuff of his striking original works. In <span class="italic">The Road</span> (1963) eighteenth-century dwellers by a country lane are haunted by the future victims of a disaster on the motorway that the lane will one day become. <span class="italic">The Stone Tape</span> (1972) offered the opposite proposition, present-day researchers beset by spirits trapped in the fabric of an old building. Another pair was prompted by the prospect of a grossly overpopulated planet. In <span class="italic">Wine of India</span> (1970) human beings earn a contract to dwell on earth, the span depending on each one's usefulness, and agree to euthanasia when their time is up. In the earlier but extraordinarily prescient <span class="italic">The Year of the Sex Olympics</span> (1968) the natural urge to make love and have children has been deliberately corrupted by non-stop pornography on all television channels, in particular a peep-show anticipating the &#145;reality television&#146; that actually manifested itself within twenty years.<br>
<br>A temporary set-back was the BBC's decision not to go ahead, on cost grounds, with a four-part epilogue to the Quatermass canon. Thames Television took over the project and in 1979 brought the concerns of the now aged professor, played by John Mills, to a respectable and rather touching conclusion&#151;or what would have been so had not a new channel, BBC4, mounted a foolhardy live performance, in 2006, of the original <span class="italic">Quatermass Experiment</span> scenario. Kneale watched it in dismay. The deepest disappointment of all was when, back in the 1970s, and again because of costs, Associated Television (ATV) abandoned production of his only major script rooted in Manx history. This was <span class="italic">Crow</span>, derived from the exploits of a notorious pirate and slave-runner. The consolation here came when Kneale's son, Matthew, drew on his father's researches for the background to his <span class="italic">English Passengers</span>, which won the Whitbread award in 2001.<br>
<br>From 1962 Kneale and his family lived on Barnes Common, London, where Kneale's friend and mentor Rudy Cartier had also settled. He continued to contribute to such popular television series as <span class="italic">Kavanagh QC</span>, and he and his wife, Judith, enjoyed travel within the limitations of his aversion to sunlight. He died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, on 29 October 2006 of multiple organ failure. He was cremated at Mortlake cemetery, Surrey, on 6 November and his ashes were scattered on Barnes Common, where also a tree was planted in his memory. He was survived by his wife, his son, and his daughter, Tracy.<br>
