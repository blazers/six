<span class="headword">Corbet,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1810), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, is probably best remembered for the controversy associated with his later career and the circumstances surrounding his death. Born of an old Shropshire family, Corbet was commissioned a lieutenant on 22 December 1796, and served with distinction in command of the cutter <i>Fulminante</i> during the operations on the coast of Egypt in 1801; he was subsequently promoted commander on 29 April 1802. Upon the outbreak of the war against Napoleon in 1803 Corbet was given the brig <i>Bittern</i> and sent to the Mediterranean where he came under the command of Vice-Admiral Nelson. His activities on that station, and particularly his &#145;officer-like and regular&#146; conduct  (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 6.363) attracted Nelson's support, and in April 1805 Nelson promoted him acting captain of the frigate <i>Amphitrite</i>. Four months later Corbet was transferred to the frigate <i>Seahorse</i> (38 guns) and, following the battle of Trafalgar, he was sent to the Jamaica station where his promotion to post captain was finally confirmed on 25 May 1806.<br>
<br>In November 1806 Corbet commissioned the frigate <i>Nereide</i> at Portsmouth and in March 1807 he was sent to escort transports carrying troops for the ill-fated campaign in the River Plate. After the withdrawal of British troops the <i>Nereide</i> returned to the Cape of Good Hope station. In August 1808 she was sent for refit to Bombay, where Corbet assumed the duties of a senior officer, thereby attracting the displeasure of his commander-in-chief, Sir Edward Pellew. The crew of the <i>Nereide</i> also raised a complaint against Corbet for cruelty, and Corbet responded by demanding a court martial. A shortage of post captains on the East India station meant that the frigate had to return to the Cape for the trial to take place. This was not explained to the crew and, believing that their complaint had been ignored, they mutinied. The mutiny was suppressed and when the ship arrived at the Cape, ten of the ringleaders were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death. Nine were subsequently pardoned and one hanged. The trial of Corbet then took place. By 1809 Corbet had acquired a reputation for such brutality that it was noted that his seamen deserted even in hostile territory.<br>
<br>Corbet was certainly a very severe commander. Between August 1806 and March 1807, for example, he ordered 134 floggings in just 211 days, with an average of seventeen lashes on each occasion. This was a brutal record by contemporary standards. At his court martial Corbet defended himself by stating that he was following the usual custom at sea even though &#145;the consequences in two instances have been unpleasant&#146;  (Lavery, 403). Corbet justified his actions by arguing that he had inherited a poorly disciplined crew and that &#145;Severity must depend upon circumstances, and whenever I have been severe, circumstances have rendered it necessary&#146;  (ibid., 404). Corbet was subsequently acquitted on all counts except that of having caused men to be &#145;started&#146; (casually beaten) with sticks of an improper size, and for this alone he was reprimanded. As a wider consequence of the court martial, however, the Admiralty implemented steps to prohibit &#145;starting&#146;.<br>
<br>Corbet and the <i>Nereide</i> were immediately returned to the Cape of Good Hope station, where they were attached to a squadron under the command of Commodore Josias Rowley. In September 1809 Rowley ordered a detachment of his ships, together with troops from the island of Rodriguez, to attack the French-held harbour of St Paul's on the Isle Bourbon which had become a rendezvous for French cruisers. Corbet, having a strong previous acquaintance with the islands, was given responsibility for landing the troops. After several days French forces abandoned St Paul's and the harbour was captured, together with the French frigate <i>Caroline</i>. The <i>Caroline</i> was renamed <i>Bourbonnaise</i> and taken into the Royal Navy. Corbet, in recognition of his services at St Paul's, was given command of her and ordered to return to Plymouth; he arrived in the spring of 1810 and was immediately appointed to the more powerfully armed frigate <i>Africaine</i>. Corbet's reputation as a harsh captain was now so well known that the crew of that frigate promptly mutinied, refusing to hear him read out his commission. The mutiny was quelled after the frigate <i>Menelaus</i> was brought alongside and her guns run out in threat.<br>
<br>By the early part of September the <i>Africaine</i> was on station in the Indian Ocean. On 12 September the frigates <i>Africaine</i> and <i>Boadicea</i>, together with the sloop <i>Otter</i> (16 guns) and the gun brig <i>Staunch</i>, gave chase to two French frigates, the <i>Iphig&eacute;nie</i> and <i>Astr&eacute;e</i>, off the Isle Bourbon. During the night the <i>Africaine</i> out-sailed the other British vessels which were unable to close with her. At 2.20 a.m. on 13 September Corbet, apparently concerned that the French frigates might escape to Port Louis, engaged the <i>Astr&eacute;e</i>, firing a double-shotted broadside into her starboard quarter. The <i>Astr&eacute;e</i> immediately returned the fire, and on her second broadside Corbet was mortally wounded when a round shot struck off his right foot above the ankle and a splinter caused a compound fracture of the thigh on the same leg. After ten minutes the <i>Astr&eacute;e</i>, having suffered some damage, surged ahead to escape from the <i>Africaine's</i> guns. The <i>Iphig&eacute;nie</i> by this time had ranged up on the leeward side of the <i>Astr&eacute;e</i>, and the <i>Africaine</i>, now commanded by Lieutenant Joseph Tullidge, ranged forward to engage her. As she did so the wind began to fall, leaving the <i>Africaine</i> with the <i>Iphig&eacute;nie</i> on her starboard side and the <i>Astr&eacute;e</i> on the larboard bow.<br>
<br>Both French frigates now took full advantage of their positions. By 4 p.m. the <i>Africaine</i> was in serious trouble, having lost her jib-boom, foremast and mizen-topmast. Her remaining officers were also either wounded or dead. By 4.45 p.m. the becalmed <i>Africaine</i> could only man six of her guns, and with the <i>Boadicea</i> still 4&#150;5 miles away Tullidge decided to strike the ship's colours. At the end of the action the <i>Africaine</i> had lost 49 dead and 114 wounded out of a crew of 295. Corbet himself had his leg amputated below the knee during the action, but died six hours later as a result of the wound.<br>
<br>Rumours about Corbet's death may have begun to circulate almost immediately. In his <span class="italic">Naval History of Great Britain</span> (1822) William James noted that there were many who insisted that Corbet was wounded by his own men, and had torn the bandages from his wounds rather than survive to face the loss of his ship  (James, 5.183). In 1823 Edward Brenton wrote that because Corbet was hated by his men they<blockquote>would not defend their ship or <i>his</i> honour, because they had been ill treated,&#151;a bad reason, but a true one. I have been told that they cut the breechings of their guns, and put <i>no shot</i> in them after the first or second broadside. (Brenton, 2.370)</blockquote>A decade later Basil Hall claimed that the crew of the <i>Africaine</i> had refused to reload their guns, preferring to be mown down by the French broadsides. Hall's comments invoked a spirited defence of Corbet by Captain Jenkin Jones, who had been on board the <i>Africaine</i> at the time of Corbet's death. Jones's account made Hall publicly retract his earlier comments, and even today the account constitutes a warning against reaching a hasty conclusion about Corbet, whose professional advancement clearly owed much to his skill and reputation for courage. Nevertheless, Corbet's system of discipline was at times exceptionally severe, and it is this as much as the circumstances of his death which has ensured his notoriety.<br>
