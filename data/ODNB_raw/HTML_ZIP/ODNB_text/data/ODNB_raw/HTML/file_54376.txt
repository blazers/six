<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skeaping,  John Rattenbury</span>  (1901&#150;1980), <span class="occ">sculptor and teacher of sculpture</span>, was born on 9 June 1901 at South Woodford, Essex, the second son of Kenneth Mathieson Skeaping (1856&#150;1946), a painter and book illustrator, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rattenbury (<i>b</i>. 1867). When he was thirteen he studied sculpture for a year at Blackheath School of Art, London, then from 1915 to 1917 attended the school of art at Goldsmiths' College; thereafter he attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts (1917&#150;19) and the Royal Academy Schools (1919&#150;20). &#145;In the two years I was there I won every prize that was open to sculpture students&#146;  (J. Skeaping, 46). In 1920 he won the Royal Academy gold medal and travelling scholarship, which enabled him to visit Rome, Siena, and Florence. Four years later he won the <i>prix de Rome</i> for sculpture and returned to Rome, where he learned marble carving from Giovanni Ardini, a professional mason. In Italy, Skeaping met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31221/', "Barbara Hepworth (1903&#150;1975)")</script>, who had been runner-up for the <i>prix de Rome</i>, and they were married at the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, on 13 May 1925. In his autobiography he recalled: &#145;Barbara had a strong influence on me. She was a great admirer of Henry Moore and all things modern. I started to change the style of my own work&#146;  (ibid., 71).<br>
<br>The couple returned to England at the end of 1926 and took rented accommodation in St Anne's Terrace, St John's Wood, London. Skeaping and Hepworth held a joint exhibition of their recent carvings and drawings in their St John's Wood studio in December 1927, and then at Tooth's Gallery, Bond Street, London, and the Alex Reid and Lefevre Gallery, Glasgow, in spring 1928. Both shows sold out and improved their financial situations. Skeaping and Hepworth were early exponents of direct carving, and Skeaping was probably the first sculptor in Britain to pierce a hole through a stone carving (<i>c</i>.1930). His sculpture at this time included animal and figure subjects influenced by non-European traditions. Wedgwood commissioned Skeaping in 1927 to produce a series of ten small animal groups for a fee of &pound;10 per animal, to be cast in glazed coloured ceramics; he produced <span class="italic">Deer</span>, <span class="italic">Kangaroo</span>, <span class="italic">Buffalo</span>, <span class="italic">Sea Lion</span>, <span class="italic">Monkeys</span>, <span class="italic">Antelope</span>, <span class="italic">Bison</span>, <span class="italic">Duiker</span>, <span class="italic">Polar Bear</span>, and <span class="italic">Tiger and Buck</span>, which were commercially very successful and popular.<br>
<br>Early in 1928 Skeaping and Hepworth moved to 7 The Mall Studios, Parkhill Road, Hampstead, close to Henry Moore, where they became part of a group of avant-garde British artists. Their son, Paul, was born in August 1929. Skeaping was a member of the London Group from 1928 to 1934 and of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96398', "Seven & Five Society")</script> in 1932, and he taught at the Central School of Arts from 1930 to 1939. He separated from Hepworth in 1931 and they were divorced in 1933. In the early 1930s Skeaping befriended Julian Huxley, secretary to the Zoological Society of London, who asked the artist to paint a fresco of animals on the walls of the new restaurant there. Huxley was also responsible for placing a large carved wooden horse by Skeaping at Whipsnade Zoo (now in the Tate collection). In 1933 Skeaping provided the illustrations for <span class="italic">The Whipsnade Animal Book</span>, and this reinforced his reputation as an animalier.<br>
<br>Skeaping married Morwenna Ward on 7 April 1934, and they had three sons&#151;twins Colin and Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1944) and Nicholas (<i>b</i>. 1947). Skeaping and his wife left London and went to live on Dartmoor; this allowed him to combine his love of animals with carving the local stone, granite. From 1940 to 1945 Skeaping served in the intelligence corps as an official war artist and spent a short spell with the SAS:<blockquote>Even in the army, the style with which he wore his beret was distinctive and at first sight made him look more like a handsome Basque gypsy than a soldier. His irreverence was profound, and of course a great tonic to his colleagues. (Sir John Astor, memorial service address, 24 April 1980)</blockquote>He taught sculpture at the Royal College of Art from 1948 and was professor of sculpture at the college from 1953 to 1959. During 1949&#150;50 he worked in Mexico, where he studied the pottery techniques of the ancient Mexicans. He was made an associate of the Royal Academy in 1950 and Royal Academician in 1960. In 1959 he left Britain to live in the Camargue, where he was surrounded by horses. His marriage to Morwenna was dissolved in 1969, and on 6 June that year he married Margery Scott in Marseilles.<br>
<br>Skeaping wrote several instructional books, beginning with <span class="italic">Animal Drawing</span> in 1936; this was followed by <span class="italic">How to Draw Horses</span> in 1941 and <span class="italic">How to Draw Dogs</span> in 1961. His more personal writings were <span class="italic">The Big Tree of Mexico</span> (1952) and his autobiography, <span class="italic">Drawn from Life</span> (1977). In the 1930s and 1940s he concentrated on animal and figure sculpture, and only later focused on equine subject matter. During the 1960s and 1970s Skeaping was much in demand making bronze portraits of champion racehorses&#151;for example, <span class="italic">Hyperion</span> for Lord Derby in 1961 and <span class="italic">Brigadier Gerard</span> for John Hislop in 1972. His sculpture may also be found in a variety of architectural settings; examples include stone corbels (1933) for Ashmore church, Dorset; wooden relief panels (1953) for the United Nations building, New York; and a black limestone relief (1958) over the main entrance of the New College of Science, Kensington, London.<br>
<br>Skeaping was given a retrospective exhibition of bronzes at Arthur Ackermann's Gallery, London, in 1979, and this show travelled to the National Museum of Racing, Saratoga, New York. Skeaping died in London on 5 March 1980, and the Ackermann Gallery mounted a scholarly retrospective exhibition in 1991 which helped to restore his reputation as a pioneer of direct carving. His work may be found in many public collections, among them the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the British Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Tate collection. The Hon. J. J. Astor, a long-standing friend of the artist, described Skeaping as<blockquote>unconventional &hellip; ubiquitous &hellip; and basically elusive. He was the best of companions: enthusiastic, sensitive, observant, sharp without being malicious, and his judgments were always worth hearing. Convention meant little to him, and never dictated his way of life. He seemed to be sustained and motivated by some inner vitality and gaiety, which both protected him and adapted him for many backgrounds. He was equally at home with primitive Mexican Indians, working with trainers at Newmarket or with herdsmen in France. (Skeaping and Hely-Hutchinson, 70)</blockquote>
