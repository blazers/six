<span class="headword">Asche,  (Thomas Stange Heiss) Oscar</span>  (1871&#150;1936), <span class="occ">actor and theatre producer</span>, was born in Geelong, Victoria, Australia, on 24 January 1871, the son of Thomas Asche (1826&#150;1898), a Norwegian by birth. Asche referred to his mother as being &#145;a Kentish woman of farming stock&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oscar Asche</span>, 17); elsewhere, she is stated to have been Thomas Asche's second wife, Harriet Emma, daughter of William Trear, licensed victualler, of Sunderland (<span class="italic">DNB</span>; Blake). Thomas Asche, who was renowned for his physical strength, had studied law in Norway and emigrated to Melbourne in 1854, but, failing to master the English language, earned his living as a hotelier and land speculator, successively in Geelong, Melbourne, and Sydney. The opportunity to meet a succession of English actors (including Dion Boucicault, G. V. Brooke, George Rignold, and Kyrle Bellew) who stayed at the Royal Hotel, Sydney, owned by his father, encouraged Oscar's youthful enthusiasm for the theatre. His other enthusiasm was cricket.<br>
<br>Adventurous by nature the young Asche left Melbourne Church of England grammar school in 1887 and travelled to China, into the Australian bush, to Fiji, and to Norway where he met Ibsen, who was &#145;pleasantly drunk&#146; at the time. Asche had a letter of introduction to Bj&ouml;rn Bj&ouml;rnson (son of the author) with whom he intended to train for the theatre, but instead he followed Ibsen's advice: &#145;Go to your own tongue language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oscar Asche</span>, 68&#150;9) and went to England. On Henry Irving's recommendation, he took elocution lessons with Walter Lacy and made his London d&eacute;but at the Op&eacute;ra Comique on 25 March 1893, playing a small role in <span class="italic">Man and Woman</span>, but he spent the next eight&#151;formative&#151;years touring with Frank Benson, having been engaged as much for his (supposed) skills behind the stumps as for those on the stage. Team-player and good sport, Asche was the quintessential &#145;Bensonian&#146;; he married Elizabeth (Lily) Brayton (daughter of Lancashire physician and surgeon John Grindall Brayton), who had joined the company in 1896, on 22 June 1898. By then Asche, having played more than 100 Shakespearian roles, had graduated to second leads&#151;Brutus, Claudius, and so on. When Benson brought his itinerant troupe to the Lyceum Theatre in the spring of 1900 Asche appeared in six of the eight productions, most notably as Pistol, Claudius, and Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, raising that smallish part to one of sinister grandeur.<br>
<br>Although Asche remained with Benson after the London season, the following year he rose to the challenge of a contemporary play in the West End, creating the role of Maldonado in Pinero's <span class="italic">Iris</span> (Garrick Theatre, 21 September 1901). Next Asche enlisted with Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre as both an actor and a producer, combining leading roles with production so that for <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (10 September 1903) he prepared (cut and rearranged!) the text, rehearsed the company, and appeared as Bolingbroke, whose coronation tableau brought the production to a scenically spectacular conclusion. Asche interrupted his seasons with Tree to play Benedick to Ellen Terry's Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (Imperial Theatre, 23 May 1903).<br>
<br>The actor having turned producer, the next step was for the producer to turn manager, or rather joint-manager with Lily Brayton and their old Bensonian colleague Otto Stuart at the Adelphi Theatre, where their greatest success was <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> (29 November 1904), with Brayton as Katherine and Asche as Christopher Sly and Petruchio. Played initially as a farce by a largely old Bensonian company, <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> became Asche's greatest success, which he and Lily Brayton played &#145;something like fifteen hundred times, in many parts of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oscar Asche</span>, 112). Asche naturally included <span class="italic">The Shrew</span> in his solo-management at His Majesty's Theatre in 1907, where the repertoire included Laurence Binyon's <span class="italic">Attila</span> and <span class="italic">Othello</span>, with Asche scoring a notable success with a depiction of the title role which drew on stereotypical characteristics of the black male. When Asche staged <span class="italic">Othello</span> during his first professional visit to Australia in 1909 it drew forceful interjections from members of the audience unfamiliar with the story&#151;such as &#145;You're a bloody liar!&#146; to Iago in act III  (<span class="italic">Oscar Asche</span>, 126).<br>
<br>At the Garrick Theatre on 19 April 1911 Asche appeared as the philosophic beggar Hajj in Edward Knoblock's <span class="italic">Kismet</span>, scoring a success as actor, producer (the first of his studiedly oriental offerings), and manager. The king and queen attended <span class="italic">Kismet</span> during its record-breaking run which concluded on the very eve (20 January 1912) of Asche's second Australian tour; this was followed by tours of New Zealand and South Africa, with performances of <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (with Asche and Brayton in the title roles) in all three countries.<br>
<br>A revival of <span class="italic">Kismet</span> was affected by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, but, undeterred, Asche successfully staged <span class="italic">Mameena</span>, an adaptation of Rider Haggard's <span class="italic">Child of the Storm</span>, at the Globe Theatre (30 September 1914). His great wartime success, <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span>, was written to fill in time during a wet week in Manchester. Enhanced by George Frederic Norton's tuneful score and sumptuous costumes and sets, <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> provided the escapism for which combatants and civilians alike clearly craved as they filled His Majesty's Theatre from August 1916 to July 1921 for a record-breaking 2238 performances. While <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> enjoyed its long run, its greatest rival as a musical hit, <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span>, was produced by Asche at Daly's Theatre in 1917.<br>
<br>Asche earned &pound;200,000 from <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span>, but the money did not last long. A stranger to any form of financial management (he never filled in cheque stubs) and an incorrigible gambler, Asche also lost heavily on his farm in Gloucestershire. Through necessity and inclination he continued to work, revisiting Australia (1923&#150;4) and trying his hand at modern-dress Shakespeare with <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> (Haymarket Theatre, 26 July 1929). He wrote his autobiography, <span class="italic">Oscar Asche: his life by himself</span> (1929), and two works of fiction, <span class="italic">The Joss-Sticks of Chung</span> and <span class="italic">The Saga of Hans Hansen</span> (1930). He appeared to have recovered from the pleurisy which had afflicted him towards the end of 1935, but on 23 March 1936 he died suddenly of coronary thrombosis at his cottage, Endways, Bisham, Berkshire, near his wife's riverside home. He left &pound;20; he had no children. Lily Brayton survived him, and married a Scottish physician, Douglas Chalmers Watson, in 1938.<br>
<br>With his Norse paternity, his antipodean upbringing, his outstanding Shakespearian repertoire, and his fascination with the Orient, Oscar Asche was a true cosmopolitan. Beneath his expansive figure and carefree, or rather careless, ways were the talents of an actor, an author, a producer, and a manager. He encompassed and succeeded in the classical tradition of Benson and Tree as well as creating what for decades remained the longest-running show in theatrical history. To Asche alone belongs the distinction of appearing (as Casca) in the Shakespeare tercentenary revival of <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> before the king and queen at Drury Lane on 2 May 1916 and a few months later making his first entrance at Her Majesty's Theatre, singing: &#145;I am Chu Chin Chow of China&#146;.<br>
