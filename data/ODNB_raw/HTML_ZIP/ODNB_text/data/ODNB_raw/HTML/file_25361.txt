<span class="headword">Sherfield,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1572, <em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">lawyer and iconoclast</span>, was baptized on 13 September 1572 at Winterbourne Earls, near Salisbury, the third son and one of five children of Richard Sherfield or Shervill (<i>c</i>.1535&#150;<i>c</i>.1620), corn dealer and small farmer, and his wife, Matilda Martin, daughter of John Martin. His life before 1607, when his voluminous papers begin, is badly documented. In 1608 he said that he had been educated &#145;as well in the country schools as afterwards in the university&#146;  (Jervoise MSS, L64/1), but no evidence has been discovered of his presence at either Oxford or Cambridge. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1598, at the relatively late age of twenty-six, and seems to have spent some time before then in Southampton, possibly working as clerk to a local lawyer. He was called to the bar in 1606.<br>
<br>Sherfield's religious inclinations may have been formed in the puritan environment of his inn. They must also have been shaped by reaction against those of his father. Richard Sherfield described himself late in life as a &#145;recusant&#146;  (Jervoise MSS, L67, testament in box 3), and that slur was also cast against other members of the family. But Richard's recusancy was intriguingly eclectic, combining a Catholic adoration of the five wounds of Christ with a decidedly sectarian interest in Christology. Sherfield's orthodox Calvinism was at odds with both of these. He also distinguished himself from his father and brothers in his capacity to channel his energy and ability into a successful career. He rapidly became a leading counsel in the court of wards and the favourite of its attorney, Sir James Ley. In 1610 he acted as intermediary in passing a bribe of a gilt cup to Ley, not without qualms of conscience recorded in his private fee book; but thereafter he carefully kept his hands clean of overt corruption, using his clients and patrons, like the Cecils and the Sackvilles, in more acceptable ways to reinforce both his London practice and his influence in the country.<br>
<br>Sherfield's local influence was firmly rooted in the triangle bounded by Salisbury, Southampton, and Winchester. It was strengthened by his marriage in 1607 to Mary Hodgson (<i>d</i>. 1613), daughter of a Winchester councillor and widow of George Bedford, a rich Salisbury clothier. Sherfield continued some of Bedford's business activities, including woad and madder growing, and retained an eye for opportunities in small-scale farming, while pursuing his legal and political career from a house in Salisbury and rooms in Lincoln's Inn. He was elected MP for Southampton in 1614 and 1621, and served as the town's recorder from 1618. In 1617 he joined the Wiltshire bench as JP, and in the same year he was appointed steward of the earl of Salisbury's west country estates, using his eldest brother, Richard, as his deputy. He had a finger in several pies, and seems deliberately to have been building a power base for his clan.<br>
<br>Though more successful than his brothers, Sherfield shared their prickly temperament. He was quick to take offence and acutely sensitive to threats to his reputation. When William Cecil, second earl of Salisbury, dismissed Richard as deputy steward in 1624, Sherfield wrote to the earl expressing the &#145;passion which worms discover when they are tread upon&#146;  (Jervoise MSS, L2/15). His papers show something of the &#145;violent&#146; character attributed to him by his enemies  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/55/64). They also reveal a profound and calculating introspection. He more than once worked out the costs and benefits of his marriage to Mary, who brought him an estate of &pound;3000 but also six stepchildren still unprovided for. (He had only one child of his own, Matilda, born in 1610.) After Mary's death in 1613, he carefully reassessed his chances in the marriage market, hoping for a rich widow or even Ley's daughter, while proclaiming (to a brother) that he counted &#145;the selling of my body &hellip; a most base, vile and abominable thing&#146;  (ibid., L67, box 2). In 1616 he married Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bailey (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1655), widow of Henry Long of Whaddon, a minor Wiltshire gentleman and one of his clients. That was a move up the social scale, although it brought the responsibility of a further eight stepchildren, and produced (he alleged) a profit of only &pound;555. Yet it was a close and companionate marriage. Rebecca's letters, extending over fourteen years until her eyesight failed, are full of love and concern and reflect a shared puritan piety and considerable mutual trust.<br>
<br>Despite his calculation, Sherfield's finances were always precarious. In the 1620s he was earning as much as &pound;400 a year at the bar, but burdened by the need to provide for a large extended family, and by his readiness to stand surety for his kinsfolk and for friends and clients such as Sir George Wrottesley and Sir Thomas Jervoise. His ambitions and his affections led him into obligations he might have been wise to avoid. His political fortunes were given a considerable boost, however, by his election as recorder of Salisbury in 1623. Already a significant figure in the vestry of St Edmund's parish, where he led a godly party including John Ivie and Peter Thatcher, the rector, he was now able to pursue their programme of civic and social reformation. As Sherfield said, they prided themselves on being engaged in &#145;wars with the drunkard, with the profane swearer, with the maypole-dancer, with every loose man and swaggerer&#146;, despite the accusations of &#145;preciseness&#146; and the label of &#145;puritan&#146; which they earned from their opponents in and around the cathedral  (Jervoise MSS L67, speech in box 3). Their goal was &#145;a reformation, a true and real reformation&#146; of the city  (ibid., L38/54). In 1630 Sherfield sealed their triumph by obtaining a new charter, confirming the town's independence of the bishop and the close.<br>
<br>As MP for Salisbury from 1624 to 1629, Sherfield sought similar success in parliament, where he could count on support from Jervoise and (after 1625) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58144/', "Walter Long")</script>, his stepson. In 1625 he was one of the first to oppose not only Buckingham, &#145;a cause of all our calamity&#146;  (Jervoise MSS, L21/1), but also Richard Montague and the Arminians. Though toning down some of the zealous rhetoric he employed in Salisbury, and billing himself instead as a &#145;good commonwealthsman&#146;  (ibid., L39/8), he was a consistent hammer of papists and introduced a bill for the protestant education of their children. In 1626 he also drafted a bill to encourage municipal brewhouses like that being used in Salisbury for relief of the poor, and he supported William Noy in his attempt to reform the poor laws. He spoke against martial law and the collection of tonnage and poundage, and collected materials on parliamentary privilege. At the same time, he was buying property in order to gain a controlling interest for himself and his kin in the pocket borough of Old Sarum. Sherfield was aspiring to a commanding parliamentary presence he never quite achieved, however; and after the dissolution of 1629 his prospects collapsed. Opposition to the crown had landed Long in the Tower, Sherfield's creditors were pressing, and he was arrested for the debts of his brother Richard.<br>
<br>Against this background, Sherfield's smashing of a stained-glass window in St Edmund's Church, Salisbury, in October 1630&#151;one of the most famous acts of iconoclasm of the century&#151;looks like an attempt to prop up his local position and reassert his authority. Instead it brought his world crashing about his ears. The window, showing God creating &#145;the sun and moon with a pair of compasses in his hand&#146;, had troubled Sherfield's &#145;conscience by the space of twenty years, for that he could not come into the church, but he must see it, sitting right opposite to it&#146;. The vestry had authorized its taking down, but Bishop John Davenant issued an injunction protecting it. Determined to &#145;preserve a good conscience&#146; and remove &#145;an occasion of idolatry&#146;, the recorder, &#145;all in black&#146; and muttering to himself, witnesses alleged, attacked the image with &#145;a black staff with a pike in the end of it&#146;. He was summoned before Star Chamber in 1633, with the king himself supervising the arrangements and Noy prosecuting. His supporters put up the best defence they could, John Ivie, for example, even testifying that he had seen Sherfield &#145;divers times&#146; kneel to receive communion. Among his judges, who included a hostile William Laud and Richard Neile, only Edward Sackville, fourth earl of Dorset, gave him any real support, advocating leniency in order to avoid &#145;the tumults of the rude ignorant people in the countries where this gentleman &hellip; hath been a good governor&#146;  (<span class="italic">State-Trials</span>, 1.400&#150;04, 415). Although he retained his place as recorder, he was fined &pound;500, forced to make public submission to Davenant, and effectively destroyed.<br>
<br>Sherfield continued to believe his &#145;afflictions and crosses&#146; the work of a benign divine providence: &#145;Did not God support me, I should have let go my hold long ere this&#146;  (Jervoise MSS, L32/39). In 1633, when he had to humiliate himself before Davenant, when fire destroyed his house at Winterbourne, and when even his own city of Salisbury called him to account for civic funds, it must have been difficult to cling on. He died early in the following year, intestate, with his financial affairs hopelessly and deliberately tangled, and with debts put at &pound;6000. He was buried in St Edmund's churchyard on 28 January 1634. His papers, the remarkable archive of a man impelled to justify himself and to square driving ambition with a godly conscience, came into the possession of Sir Thomas Jervoise, once his debtor and now the chief of his creditors.<br>
