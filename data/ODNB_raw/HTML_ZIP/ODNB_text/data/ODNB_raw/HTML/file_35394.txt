<span class="headword">Parry,  Joseph</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Pencerdd America]</span>  (1841&#150;1903), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 21 May 1841 at 4 Chapel Row, Georgetown, Merthyr Tudful, the second son of Daniel Parry and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Richards). Daniel Parry, a finer at the local ironworks, was illiterate, which may account for some confusion over the rendering of his name in official documents: though he is Daniel on Joseph's birth certificate and his own marriage certificate, the 1841 and 1851 censuses wrongly record him as David. He and his wife came from west Wales; Elizabeth Parry was reputed to be a good musician. At the time of the 1851 census&#151;the last before the family emigrated&#151;Joseph had an elder brother, Henry, and two younger sisters, Elizabeth and Jane.<br>
<br>Parry had little early education and began work in a coal mine at the age of nine. Three years later he moved to the Crawshay family's Cyfarthfa ironworks, where he was a puddler. In later life he claimed to have acquired his first taste for music by listening to the Cyfarthfa band rehearsing outdoors. In 1853 his father emigrated to America, and the rest of the family followed a year later. They settled in Danville, Pennsylvania, where there was a large Welsh community. At Danville, Parry took a job in an iron mill, where he remained until 1865, but learned music, including harmony and counterpoint, while working at the mill. His teachers, John Abel Jones and W. J. Price, were both emigr&eacute; Welshmen, the latter from Tredegar. In May 1862 he married at Danville, Jane, the daughter of Gomer Thomas. They had five children: Joseph Haydn, Mendelssohn, William Sterndale, Annie, and Dilys.<br>
<br>In 1860 Parry won a composition prize at the Danville eisteddfod with a work called <span class="italic">Temperance Vocal March</span>, and it was about this time that he began sending works to Welsh eisteddfodic competitions. He won prizes at Swansea in 1863 and Llandudno in 1864. He attended the Aberystwyth eisteddfod in 1865 and it was there, following his induction to the gorsedd (the Welsh eisteddfodic bardic society), that he was conferred with the bardic title Pencerdd America. His eisteddfod successes and the popularity of some of his publications caused a public subscription fund to be set up to enable him to study at the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended between 1868 and 1871. He was a composition pupil of Sterndale Bennett and learned vocal technique from Manuel Garc&iacute;a. In 1871 he received the MusB from Cambridge University, the first Welsh person to do so. On leaving the academy he returned to Danville, where he set up a private music school or, as he preferred it to be known, a &#145;musical institute&#146;.<br>
<br>Three years later Parry returned to Wales to become professor of music at the newly opened University College of Wales at Aberystwyth. In 1880 he resigned. Several reasons have been given for the brevity of this appointment: the college could not accept Parry's insistence that women should be allowed to become undergraduates (so that there would be an appropriate supply of female voices for his choirs), but there were other issues. The college was in some financial difficulty and its managers were in frequent dispute with their professor of music, who was less respected as an administrator and teacher than as a composer. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that Parry himself was not an easy man to deal with. None the less, while at the college, he was awarded a MusD by Cambridge University. A male voice choir travelled from Aberd&acirc;r to Cambridge to perform his composition exercise, a cantata called <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, in King's College chapel. Parry's national reputation was consolidated during his period at Aberystwyth, and he spent a great deal of time travelling around Wales, conducting and promoting his own works. He was much sought after as a conductor of the <i>cymanfa ganu</i> (singing festival).<br>
<br>Between 1881 and 1888 Parry lived in Swansea, where he established and ran the Musical College of Wales. He left Swansea in order to become lecturer and head of the music department at the new University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire at Cardiff. At this time he established yet another private music school, the South Wales School of Music. He bought a house called Cartref in Victoria Road, Penarth on the outskirts of Cardiff, and died there on 17 February 1903. He was buried at St Augustine's churchyard, Penarth.<br>
<br>Parry's output was considerable and included six operas, of which <span class="italic">Blodwen</span> (first performed in concert at Swansea, 1878) was the first Welsh-language opera and is said to have had five hundred performances by the end of the century, although its first staged version was given in Colwyn Bay on 29 April 1919. He also wrote two oratorios&#151;a third was in preparation at the time of his death&#151;and a number of cantatas and orchestral and vocal works. His <span class="italic">Tydfil Overture</span>, written and arranged for the Cyfarthfa band, is probably the earliest original work for brass band written by a significant musical figure. Parry's work has never been properly catalogued or assessed, but there is no doubt that he, more than any other Welsh composer before him, successfully engaged with the main forms and traditions of Western art music while preserving a distinctively Welsh identity. His hymn tunes, particularly &#145;Aberystwyth&#146;, have enduring popularity, and his partsong &#145;Myfanwy&#146; can confidently be cited as the most popular and performed piece written to a Welsh text for male voice choir. In 1893 he co-edited <span class="italic">Cambrian Minstrelsie</span>, a national collection of Welsh songs. He wrote and lectured widely on Welsh music and was at the forefront of many initiatives to improve musical education in the principality. His obituaries properly described him as the most important Welsh musician of his generation. Parry's life was romanticized in Jack Jones's novel <span class="italic">Off to Philadelphia in the Morning</span> (1947), which was made into a popular television serial by the BBC.<br>
<br>One of Parry's sons, <a name="cosubject_45800"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Haydn Parry</span>  (1864&#150;1894) was also a <span class="occ">composer</span>. He wrote three operas, <span class="italic">Cigarette</span> (Cardiff, 1892), <span class="italic">Miami</span> (London, 1893), and <span class="italic">Marigold Farm</span> (as yet unperformed). In the 1890s he was a professor at the Guildhall School of Music in London. His works are light in character. Although he possessed much of his father's entrepreneurial ability, he did not have the same musical talent or celebrity.<br>
