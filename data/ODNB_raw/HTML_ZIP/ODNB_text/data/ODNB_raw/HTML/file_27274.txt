<span class="headword">Thompson, Sir  Matthew William</span>, first baronet  (1820&#150;1891), <span class="occ">railway administrator</span>, born at Manningham in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 1 February 1820, was the son of Matthew Thompson of Manningham Lodge, Bradford, and his wife, Elizabeth Sarah, daughter of the Revd William Atkinson of Thorparch. He was educated at private schools and in 1840 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1843 and MA in 1846. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1847, and for ten years practised as a conveyancing counsel. Having married on 10 May 1843 Mary Anne, daughter of his uncle, Benjamin Thompson of Park Gate, Guiseley, who possessed the controlling influence in the old brewery, Bradford, he retired from the bar in 1857 and went to Bradford to take a part in the management and development of the brewery. Almost immediately he began to be actively involved in municipal affairs, becoming a town councillor in 1858, an alderman in 1860, and mayor of Bradford in 1862. In 1865 he was elected a director of the Midland Railway, and in 1867 was returned as a Liberal-Conservative borough member for Bradford, with William Edward Forster as his colleague. He was not a committed politician, and did not stand at the general election in 1868; but he did unsuccessfully contest the constituency again in March 1869 after the unseating of the Conservative member, Henry William Ripley. In 1871 and 1872 he was re-elected mayor of Bradford, and in October 1873 he was publicly entertained and a presentation of plate was made to him in recognition of his services.<br>
<br>In 1879 Thompson became chairman of the Midland Railway, and he immediately began to make felt the effects of his rigorous and energetic management. He was also chairman of the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and a director and sometime chairman of the Forth Bridge Railway Company. Parliamentary sanction for the building of the Forth Bridge had been obtained in 1873, but the work was not begun until 1882, when the Midland Railway's policy towards the financing of the bridge was greatly influenced by Thompson. The shareholders of the Forth Bridge Railway Company were guaranteed 4 per cent on their capital by the North British, Midland, Great Northern, and North Eastern railway companies, the Midland Railway under Thompson putting forward the largest single contribution to the bridge's &pound;3 million cost. The bridge was completed in January 1890, and formally opened by the prince of Wales on 4 March 1890. On this occasion a baronetcy was conferred upon Thompson, in recognition of the ability with which he had helped forward the undertaking.<br>
<br>Thompson resigned the chairmanship of the Midland Railway in 1890, because of failing health. He died at Park Gate, Guiseley on 1 December 1891, and was buried on 5 December in the churchyard there. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and two daughters.<br>
