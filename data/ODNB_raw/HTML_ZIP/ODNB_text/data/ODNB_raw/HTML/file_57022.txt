<span class="headword">Adler,  Henrietta <span class="st"> [Nettie]</span></span>  (1868&#150;1950), <span class="occ">social worker and Jewish political activist</span>, was born in London on 1 December 1868, the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30343/', "Rabbi Dr Hermann Adler (1839&#150;1911)")</script> and his wife, Rachel Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1912). Her father was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/167/', "Dr Nathan Marcus Adler")</script>, chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire. From 1879 Hermann was delegate chief rabbi, acting for his father in the many duties for which the office called, and in 1891, following Nathan's death the previous year, Hermann became chief rabbi in his own right. Nettie Adler thus grew up in an Orthodox Jewish milieu; she remained loyal to this upbringing throughout her life. However, her relationship with her father was rarely happy. Educated privately, Nettie rebelled against Hermann's attempts to dictate to her the terms on which her life was to be led. In 1894 she fell in love with Isaac Friedner, a synagogue official in Liverpool. Hermann considered Friedner to be unworthy of his daughter, forbade the match, and intercepted their correspondence. Nettie never married. In politics Hermann was a staunch tory. Nettie identified with the Liberal Party, a move which Hermann viewed as nothing less than an act of familial treachery. During the London county council (LCC) elections of March 1904, when Nettie (as a good Liberal) campaigned against state aid for denominational schools, Hermann let it be known publicly that she was working without his authority or consent.<br>
<br>In common with many middle-class women in Victorian England, Nettie Adler was drawn into social and educational work among the poor, specifically, in her case, among the Jewish and non-Jewish slum-dwellers of London's East End. More or less automatically she joined the visiting committee of the Jewish Board of Guardians and the Jewish religious education board. But her belief that charity would not by itself alleviate the consequences of poverty drew her also to the world of local government in the capital. She joined the Progressive Party&#151;in effect the liberal party in London municipal politics&#151;and quickly rose in its ranks, becoming a school manager under the auspices of the London school board, and from 1905 until 1910 serving as a co-opted member of the LCC's education committee.<br>
<br>At its inception (1889) women had not been expressly excluded from membership of the LCC; the prohibition came about as a result of subsequent legal action, which was reversed by the Liberal government in 1908. Nettie was at once adopted by the Progressives in the LCC's Central Hackney division. At the LCC elections of March 1910 she brought into the division a glittering array of Liberal personalities, including the Jews Herbert Samuel and Rufus Isaacs and the non-Jews Sidney Webb and Sir J. W. Benn, the leader of the Progressives at county hall. Nettie made no secret of her Jewish identity, refusing to campaign on the Saturday of the poll, the Jewish sabbath. She won a comfortable majority, thus becoming one of the first two women (the other was Susan Lawrence, a Municipal Reformer) to sit as of right on the LCC, of which she was deputy chairman in 1922&#150;3.<br>
<br>Nettie's tenure of the Central Hackney division provided the springboard for a remarkable career focused not merely on London government but also on the more general problems of poverty, especially among children and young people. As a justice of the peace attached to juvenile courts she became an internationally acknowledged authority on juvenile delinquency. She accepted membership of a number of important inquiries into aspects of child poverty in the inter-war period, and served on the committee on wage-earning children, of which she was joint honorary secretary from 1899 until 1946, the departmental committee on charity collections (1925&#150;7), and the advisory committee of the Board of Trade on juvenile labour exchanges. The high regard in which she was held in Whitehall was reflected in her appointment as a commander in the Order of the British Empire in 1934.<br>
<br>Nettie's political career was, however, blighted in three respects. As a Progressive she suffered as a result of the decline in Liberal fortunes after 1918. As a Jewess she was a victim of the resurgence of antisemitism in Britain after the First World War. She also suffered from poor health. In 1925, as a protest against the anti-Jewish prejudices of the Municipal Reformers (that is, the Conservatives) on the LCC, she declined to continue the arrangement by which she had &#145;shared&#146; the Central Hackney division with a member of that party, and lost the seat. In 1928 she won it back in spite of a Municipal Reform campaign in which her Jewish identity was made into a major issue at the polls. In 1931 she announced that she would not fight the seat again.<br>
<br>A member of the governing bodies of numerous Jewish and non-Jewish charities and educational institutions, Nettie Adler was also a prolific writer on social themes, publishing many articles and pamphlets on children as wage earners, working women, the treatment of young offenders, and the juvenile court system. She wrote for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> and contributed the chapter entitled &#145;Jewish life and labour in east London&#146; to the <span class="italic">New Survey of London Life and Labour</span>, edited by Hubert Llewellyn Smith and published in 1934. She died of heart failure at Glazbury Nursing Home, 20 Glazbury Road, London, on 15 April 1950.<br>
