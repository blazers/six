<span class="headword">Ely,  Richard  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1177&#150;1189), <span class="occ">prior of Ely and historian</span>, was a monk of Ely Cathedral priory from boyhood. Little is known of the details of his life and death, but he is commonly identified with the Richard who was sub-prior of Ely in the early 1170s and prior from 1177 until at least 1189. Richard is usually regarded as having been the author of the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, a work in three books covering the main phases of the history of Ely. However, authorship has also been claimed for one <a name="cosubject_27204"></a><span class="headword">Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1177)<span class="occ"></span>, also a monk at Ely, on the basis of a miraculous cure recorded in the <span class="italic">Liber</span> as wrought by St &AElig;thelthryth &#145;in me myself, Thomas by name&#146;, a cure whose authenticity could not be doubted on the grounds that &#145;I Thomas have had it inserted on this page&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, ed. Blake, 312, 314). The &#145;I myself&#146;, it is argued, was the compiler of the <span class="italic">Liber</span>, whose name was thus Thomas, and whose reference to Richard as prior shows that he was writing no earlier than 1177. Although this story has its own interest, as showing a monastic writer attempting to shame the writers of his day into making greater efforts to spread the merits of their saints by introducing an exemplary story of his own, the likelihood is that the whole episode, containing the Thomas miracle and the &#145;I Thomas&#146; passages, was derived from an earlier collection, one that had no connection with the compiler of the <span class="italic">Liber</span>. But even if Thomas's authorship be conceded, this would only affect the first two books, from &AElig;thelthryth's foundation to the creation of the bishopric in 1109, and book 3, dealing with the acts of the first two bishops of Ely, down to 1169, is substantially Richard's work.<br>
<br>As far as his training for the writing of history was concerned, Richard probably benefited from the teaching at Ely from about 1138 by the rhetorician Julian, who had taught liberal arts (his grammar being preferable to that of some of the Latin writers), philosophy, and theology in his own home town of London. Later Richard seems to have performed the duties of a cellarer, being praised for his prudent provision for the needs of each individual monk from the abbey's common substance. This probably explains why he &#145;alone of all&#146; refused to accept the alienation of the manor of Stetchworth assigned to the monks' food and clothing. Conducting the subsequent appeal to Rome in 1150 with the newfangled procedure of papal judges-delegate, Richard so impressed Pope Eugenius III with his eloquence that he earned a much fuller access and colloquy than the others, which he used to air the grievances of the priory. This papal audience must have been the high point of his career, second only to his other achievement as the priory historian.<br>
<br>The quality of books 1 and 2, and of the approximately 140 documents in book 3, is bound to be uneven, varying with the value of each component part, the accuracy of its transmission, and its placing in an appropriate chronological and historical context. This last was successfully achieved with the incorporation of the <span class="italic">Libellus</span> of Bishop &AElig;thelwold (<i>d</i>. 984) into book 2, but not with the divers sources of the Norman conquest. The contemporary history of book 3 evoked some lively historical narrative&#151;including the use of Sallust's <span class="italic">Bellum Catilinae</span>, as in the description of King Stephen's &#145;anarchy&#146;&#151;such that the later redactor of the <span class="italic">Liber</span> was able to admire Richard &#145;as a man most zealous in the business of histories [<i>historiarum studiosissimus</i>], accomplished and most eloquent in discourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, ed. Blake, 284). Yet he could be guilty of quite atrocious bias. The professional administrators installed by Bishop Nigel (<i>d</i>. 1169) to administer the see of Ely during his own absences in the 1130s are pictured as a bunch of &#145;malefactors&#146; bent on looting the abbey's treasures. Oppressed, however, by the sufferings (including seven deaths) inflicted by the avenging St &AElig;thelthryth, he would have deferred a promise to name them and their punishments, but for a fear of being called a liar. But eventually, fatigued by the burden of his zeal, Richard arranged to enjoy his retirement &#145;thinking that, long buffeted by the waves of this great labour, he had been released from the demands of this prolix work and reached the harbour of perpetual idleness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, ed. Blake, 391).<br>
