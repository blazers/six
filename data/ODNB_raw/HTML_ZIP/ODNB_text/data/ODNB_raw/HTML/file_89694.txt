<span class="headword">James,  John  Angell-</span>  (1901&#150;2002), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born in Odiham, Hampshire, on 23 August 1901, the fourth of five children of John Angell James (1864&#150;1953), medical practitioner, and his wife, Emily Cormell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashwin (1862&#150;1958). An elder brother was Manley Angell James (1896&#150;1975), awarded a VC in 1918 for bravery during the German &#145;spring offensive&#146;.<br>
<br>When the family moved to Bristol, Angell-James (it is not clear at what point he began hyphenating his name) attended Bristol grammar school and the University of Bristol, where he qualified MB ChB with first-class honours in 1924. Also in 1924, at Guy's Hospital, London, he qualified MB BS with a distinction in medicine. Following junior medical appointments in Bristol and London, he gained membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London and an MD of London University in 1927, before specializing in ear, nose, and throat surgery. Enthusiasm for his speciality was sparked when house surgeon in Bristol to J. P. Harty, who had succeeded the internationally renowned Patrick Watson-Williams, ranked by Angell-James as &#145;one of the fathers of British rhinology&#146;  (unpublished autobiography). He obtained the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1928. The same year he was appointed honorary ear, nose, and throat surgeon to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and clinical assistant at the Golden Square Throat Hospital, London. In 1929 he also became assistant ear, nose, and throat surgeon at the Bristol Royal Infirmary and clinical teacher to the university. A former medical student recalled his excellence as a teacher and surgeon who radiated a strong sense of dedication. On 28 June 1930 he married Evelyn Miriam Everard (1905&#150;1998), daughter of Francis Over Everard, electrical engineer. They had a son, Roger (<i>b</i>. 1932), and two daughters, Rosemary (<i>b</i>. 1935) and Jennifer (<i>b</i>. 1937).<br>
<br>During the Second World War Angell-James worked for the Emergency Medical Service from 1940 to 1942 before joining the Royal Army Medical Corps as a major at the head injuries unit in Oxford and subsequently in military hospitals in North Africa and Italy. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1945, he was adviser in otorhinolaryngology to the Middle East forces based in Cairo until demobilization in 1946. Establishment of the National Health Service in 1948 granted him consultant status to the Children's Hospital and the United Bristol Hospitals until his formal retirement in 1966; additionally he attended district hospitals at Melksham, Clevedon, Malmesbury, and Tetbury. Enthusiasm for his speciality motivated him to visit important centres abroad, including in 1927 the Allgemeine Krankenhaus in Vienna where Adam Politzer had initiated an otolaryngology service in 1861, and a fact-finding tour in 1935 to New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Harvard, and the Mayo Clinic. He visited Mischele Arslan of Padua in 1955 to purchase the pioneering Arslan-Federici ultrasonic apparatus for research in Bristol, and Niels Riskaer of Copenhagen in 1958 to observe hypophysectomy by a naso-transethmoid route.<br>
<br>Angell-James is chiefly remembered for refining the trans-nasal approach to the pituitary for hypophysectomy, principally undertaken for secondary carcinoma of breast origin. After trials to devise a safe anatomical route assisted by binocular vision and specifically designed instruments, he commenced this sophisticated operation in 1960, achieving 345 hypophysectomies by 1965. Metastatic pain was often relieved rapidly and of 287 breast cases, remission for a year or more assisted forty-six patients. Few surgeons became adept at this meticulous procedure. By 1974 he reported on 401 hypophysectomies of which 343 were for breast cancer. His other operative forte, the management of Meni&egrave;re's disease by ultrasound, followed research on sheep and refinement of Arslan's ultrasonic apparatus by physicist colleagues; this was applied to the inner ear after surgical exposure through the mastoid bone. Of 279 procedures in 1969, he reported vertigo and tinnitus diminished significantly while hearing loss responded less well. Of Angell-James's many other publications, his account of the rise of otorhinolaryngology from 1543 to 1961 provided a valuable historical summary.<br>
<br>One of few surgeons to receive the fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of London (in 1965), Angell-James was also an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, chairman of both the specialist advisory committee in otorhinolaryngology and the editorial committee of the <span class="italic">Journal of Clinical Otolaryngology</span> and Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons of England; he was made a CBE in 1967. Recognition of his work and influence was acknowledged by many invitations to lecture and receive awards including the Horne memorial prize of the British Medical Association (1962), the Colles medal of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (1963), the Yearsley lecture and medal (1966), the Wilde memorial lecture (1966), and the Dalby and Harrison prizes of the Royal Society of Medicine (1963 and 1968). He was elected president of the British Association of Otolaryngologists (1966&#150;9), the Bath, Bristol and Somerset branch of the British Medical Association (1968&#150;9), the International Collegium Oto-Rhino-Laryngologicum (1974), and the Otolaryngological Research Society (1978). He was awarded honorary membership of the South African, Irish, and German Otolaryngological societies, the British Medical Association, and the Royal Society of Medicine.<br>
<br>Angell-James purchased Litfield House, Clifton Down, Bristol, in 1936, for multi-specialist private practice. Among those who consulted him were Queen Mary, Winston Churchill, Colonel Gaddafi of Libya, and numerous actors and singers. He rarely invoiced friends, colleagues, or former service personnel. Some six feet one inch tall, he played hockey for Bristol University and for Gloucestershire, retaining his fitness later by sailing, tennis, gardening, hunting, fishing, and shooting. He purchased a farm in 1950 to keep prize Guernsey cows which sometimes he milked before attending patients, and he also kept pedigree pigs and prize bulls which he often loaned to other farms. He exhibited regularly at the Bath and West and Royal shows, winning a silver medal at an International Dairy Event for his novel calf and lamb resuscitator. A committed Christian, he was churchwarden at Falfield, Gloucestershire, for many years. Following a stroke and pneumonia he died at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, on 19 June 2002. He was survived by his three children. The residue of his private practice clinical notes, X-rays, operative films, books, and surgical instruments, stored in the old dairy, were assessed in 2012 and significant instruments were donated to the Historic Instrument Collection of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.<br>
