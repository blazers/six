<span class="headword">Vokins <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bunce]</span>,  Joan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1690), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and traveller</span>, was the daughter of Thomas Bunce (<i>d</i>. 1682?), a yeoman farmer of Charney Bassett, Berkshire. Joan and her husband, Richard Vokins, a yeoman farmer of West Challow, Berkshire, had three sons and three daughters; one son predeceased her. Her first child, Richard, was born on 30 June 1654, suggesting that she herself was probably born about 1630.<br>
<br>In 1663 Oliver Sansom, husband of her younger sister Jane, declared himself a Quaker and converted Joan Vokins along with the rest of his and his wife's families. Vokins became one of the leaders of the Quakers of north Berkshire, and an assiduous attender at the monthly meetings where administrative matters were discussed. The women's meetings in the Vale of the White Horse, which Vokins and Jane Sansom dominated, became a personal commitment. Such meetings came under attack in 1678 from supporters of the Wilkinson&#150;Storey schism, which aimed to move the Quakers towards conventional nonconformist respectability, and in particular to abolish the women's meetings. Vokins participated in a stormy conference in Reading to ensure their continuance.<br>
<br>About this time, Vokins felt herself called to undertake a visit to the American colonies, to which many Quakers were emigrating. After arriving in New York in May 1680 she began a comprehensive tour in which she preached, attended meetings, set up new local Quaker organizations, and joined in actions against a heretical Quaker sect, the &#145;ranters&#146;. She returned to New York in late summer in the expectation of returning to England, but was inspired to go to Barbados instead. It was the hurricane season, and she found herself making an impromptu tour of the Caribbean islands, at the mercy of winds and the availability of shipping. She had no doubt expected to reach Barbados by December, in time for a meeting which was to discuss the Wilkinson&#150;Storey controversy, but arrived too late. In Barbados she worked tirelessly, holding two or three meetings each day and preaching to both white and black people. She arrived back in Dover in June 1681 and prolonged her preaching tour with another three weeks in Kent before returning home. Another major journey, in 1686, took her to Ireland. How these journeys were organized and financed remains obscure.<br>
<br>In line with Quaker ideology, Vokins saw herself as a servant, even a soldier, obedient unconditionally to the commands of the indwelling Christ. These commands came to her perception direct and unmediated. The tasks with which she would be entrusted might be difficult, but prophetic inspiration and providential occurrences would ensure success. She was particularly chosen because her own bodily weakness and insignificance emphasized the divine power which worked through her. In fact, her achievements are all the more noteworthy in that she was permanently in poor health, sometimes bedridden, and often in pain. During her American journey she was dependent on female companions met by chance and apparently persuaded to remain with her; on one occasion she had to be carried into a meeting where she was to preach. What she sought above all in her religion was an emotional communion with other believers, especially with fellow members of the women's meetings, and a feeling of the presence of the holy spirit among them.<br>
<br>Vokins died on 22 July 1690 in Reading, having fallen ill on her way home from a meeting in London. Her husband survived her. Her writings were edited by Oliver Sansom into a volume of standard Quaker hagiography under the title <span class="italic">God's Mighty Power Magnified</span> (1691).<br>
