<span class="headword">Prim,  John George Augustus</span>  (1821&#150;1875), <span class="occ">antiquary and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born in Kilkenny, the eldest son of John H. Prim. He was probably educated in Kilkenny. He was a general printer and stationer in the city and in the mid-1850s became proprietor of the <span class="italic">Kilkenny Moderator</span>, a Conservative newspaper founded in 1814. In 1849, with James Graves, Prim founded the Kilkenny and South East of Ireland Archaeological Society and acted as its honorary secretary. The society's object was to publish articles on local history and archaeology, but Prim and Graves did not stop there, regarding themselves as the guardians of their antiquities, and as their interpreters. They tackled local landowners who were neglecting and destroying monuments: in 1848 they physically intervened in the case of the Dunbell ogham stones, which they rescued when their site was being destroyed (the stones are now in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin). They also published the collections held in the muniment room in Kilkenny Castle. This was particularly fortunate as much of this material was subsequently sent to the Public Record Office in Dublin, where it was destroyed in the fire of 1922.<br>
<br>Prim saw the <span class="italic">Moderator</span> as more than a reporter of local news, and used it to widen understanding of the history of Kilkenny and the county. When the society was unable to issue a journal of its own, he used the newspaper to publish articles on local history and archaeology. The society became the Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland in 1868, and Prim was one of its founding fellows. Prim and Graves wrote the history of the architecture and antiquities of St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny (1857). It was first intended to be a history of the see and bishops of Ossory, and of the corporation of Kilkenny, but the material proved to be so large that this plan had to be abandoned and they confined themselves to the cathedral. They had hoped to publish a second volume to include the rest of their material, but this never happened. Prim also planned to write a series of articles on the most important families of Kilkenny as part of a history of the county&#151;one of the original objects of the society. His <span class="italic">Memorials of the Family of Langton of Kilkenny</span> (1864) was part of this project.<br>
<br>Prim was married&#151;to a woman of whom nothing is known but that her name was Mary&#151;and had a family. He died on 2 November 1875 at Nore Cottage, Kilkenny, his brother's house, and was buried in the churchyard of St Canice's, Kilkenny. His kindness and generosity, and his work on the history and culture of Ireland, were widely recognized.<br>
