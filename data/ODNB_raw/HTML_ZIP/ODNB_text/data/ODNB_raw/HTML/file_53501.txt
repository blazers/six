<span class="headword">Dilke,  Ashton Wentworth</span>  (1850&#150;1883), <span class="occ">traveller and politician</span>, was born on 11 August 1850 in London, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7646/', "Sir (Charles) Wentworth Dilke, first baronet (1810&#150;1869)")</script>, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1853), the only daughter of Captain William Chatfield, Madras cavalry; his elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32824/', "Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, second baronet")</script>, the Liberal cabinet minister. Dilke was educated privately before being admitted at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1868. He was made a scholar in 1870, and was prominent in the Cambridge Union in 1871, but left without taking a degree, being anxious to travel in and discover more about Russia, having visited the country on three occasions in 1869. He spent some two years during 1872&#150;3 visiting much of Russia and central Asia, living for some months in a Russian village, studying the language, and examining the condition of the peasantry. He returned showing symptoms of the consumption which later killed him, but began a book on Russia, one or two chapters of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> in 1874, although it was never published complete. His energies were absorbed by the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>, which he bought for &pound;14,000 in January 1875 and edited for fifteen months until 1876, and then again from 1878 to 1880. He published a translation of Turgenev's <span class="italic">Virgin Soil</span> in 1878.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1876 Dilke married <a href="#cosubject_53501">Margaret Mary Smith [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1880 he was returned to parliament for Newcastle upon Tyne. Variously described as an advanced Liberal and a radical (he was secretary of the Radical Club and a member of the London Municipal Reform League), he seemed set for an active career but his health, never robust, gradually gave way and he resigned his seat at the beginning of the session of 1883. He spent the last few months of his life at Algiers, where he died on 12 March 1883.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_53501"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Mary <span class="st"> [Maye]</span> Dilke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smith; <em>other married name </em>Cooke]</span></span>  (1857&#150;1914), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born at Hampton, Middlesex, on 4 September 1857, the eldest daughter in the family of ten children of Thomas Eustace Smith (1831&#150;1903), shipowner and Liberal MP for Tynemouth, and his wife, Martha Mary Dalrymple (1835&#150;1919). She was brought up in the family home, Gosford House, Newcastle upon Tyne, and was educated at Orl&eacute;ans where she passed the public examination for French schoolmistresses. In 1886 she gave evidence in the divorce proceedings involving her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38881/', "Virginia Crawford")</script>. Her testimony, which was loyal to her sister, incriminated her brother-in-law and the guardian of her children, the politician Sir Charles Dilke, and was said to have strongly influenced the jury.<br>
<br>From 1878 Maye Dilke was an active member of the National Society for Women's Suffrage and became a member of its executive. When the society split, in 1888, she joined the remaining members who formed the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage, becoming the society's treasurer in 1896. In 1885 she published <span class="italic">Women's Suffrage</span> and in 1889 contributed an article to the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> in response to the anti-suffragist appeal against women's suffrage. Involved in Liberal politics, she was elected in 1888 a member of the London School Board for Lambeth, advocating free education. She retired from the board in 1891.<br>
<br>On 19 September 1891 she married William Russell Cooke (1854/5&#150;1903), solicitor and legal adviser to the Liberal party, at Kensington parish church. They had two sons. As Mrs Russell Cooke she continued her suffrage activities and was also active in the Women's Emancipation Union. Having attended the International Council of Women at Washington, USA, in 1888, she was one of those who, in 1897, advocated the creation of a national council of women to represent all the societies in which women took a part. In 1899 she opposed provisions which would have curtailed the role of women in London local government. Among the other causes which she took up was the provision of seating for women shop assistants, who were required to stand for long periods.<br>
<br>After the death of her second husband she settled on the Isle of Wight, where she became a member of the county education committee and unsuccessfully stood for the county council (being the first woman candidate). After a long illness she died at her home, Bellecroft, near Newport, Isle of Wight, on 19 May 1914. The elder son of her first marriage, Fisher Wentworth Dilke (1877&#150;1944), succeeded as fourth baronet in 1918; the elder of her second marriage, Sidney Russell Cooke (1892&#150;1930), became a Liberal parliamentary candidate.<br>
