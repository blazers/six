<span class="headword">Duddell,  William Du Bois</span>  (1872&#150;1917), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 1 July 1872 at 23 Westmoreland Place, Kensington, London, the son of Frances Kate Du Bois. The identity of his father is unknown. In 1881 his mother married George Duddell (<i>d</i>. 1887), a landowning gentleman of Queen's Park, Brighton. An asthmatic, delicate child, William received his early education privately in England, and at the Coll&egrave;ge Stanislas, Cannes, where the family had moved for the benefit of his health. William showed mechanical ability at an early age. When only four, he is said to have fitted a toy mouse with a clockwork motor. From 1890 to 1893 he was apprenticed to the firm of Davey, Paxman &amp; Co. at Colchester. His skills were obviously known to his friends, as his landlady is said to have complained at the number of clocks being brought to her house for repair.<br>
<br>William Duddell studied at the Central Technical College (later the City and Guilds College), South Kensington, under professors Ayrton and Mather, obtaining a Whitworth exhibition in 1896, and a Whitworth scholarship in 1897. There he became interested in the alternating-current electric arc. His work was hindered by the clumsiness of the Joubert &#145;point to point&#146; method used at that time to delineate alternating-current waveforms. Andr&eacute; Blondel, in Paris, had suggested modifying a moving-coil meter by reducing it to a rudimentary form consisting simply of one single loop of wire under tension, thereby reducing its mechanical inertia to the point where the coil could follow the instantaneous variations of the current. Movement of the loop was observed by directing a light beam at a small mirror fixed to it. Projection of the reflected beam on to a screen or photographic plate by a vibrating mirror then revealed the waveform. Using his great skills, Duddell developed this idea into a fully engineered oscillograph. He and his colleague, E. W. Marchant, described both the oscillograph and the results of their observations on the arc in a paper published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers</span> in 1899 (28, 1&#150;107). The demonstration of the oscillograph caused a sensation, since those present realized that they now had, for the first time, a convenient and speedy method of displaying waveforms. The Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co. manufactured many different models of these oscillographs and they were used until the Second World War when they were gradually superseded by cathode-ray oscillographs (or oscilloscopes as they then became known).<br>
<br>Duddell developed many other instruments, including a vibration galvanometer; a thermo-ammeter based on Boys's radio-micrometer; a twisted-strip galvanometer; and a version of Einthoven's string galvanometer. All bore the stamp of his manual skills and his minute attention to detail. He retained his interest in the electric arc and in 1901 revealed his discovery that an arc connected across a capacitor and an inductor could oscillate&#151;the so-called &#145;musical arc&#146; or &#145;singing arc&#146;. He demonstrated the effect at a public lecture by causing an arc to play the tune &#145;God Save the King&#146;. This phenomenon became the basis of the arc method of radio transmission, developed most notably by Valdemar Poulsen.<br>
<br>William Duddell also played an active part in his profession, and received many honours, being president of the R&ouml;ntgen Society in 1907, of the Institution of Electrical Engineers from 1912 to 1914, and of the Commission Internationale de T&eacute;l&eacute;graphie sans Fils in 1914. He was also vice-president and honorary treasurer of the Physical Society. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London on 2 May 1907 and he received their Hughes medal in 1912. He was awarded gold medals from the Paris Exhibition in 1900 and the St Louis Exhibition in 1904.<br>
<br>Duddell, who was unmarried, lived at 47 Hans Place, Knightsbridge, London, moving about 1904 to 36 Walton Street, Chelsea. He died at Newlands House, 180 Tooting Bec Road, London, on 4 November 1917, of general paralysis, aged only forty-five; he was buried four days later at Brighton. It was thought that the drastic deterioration in his health was caused by the intensive government war work on which he was engaged. He was survived by his mother, by then Mrs Smithers, and by his younger sister, Mrs Blanche Gladys Du Bois Colston. He left effects worth &pound;4735 7<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. Some months before his death he was appointed commander in the Order of the British Empire. However, he was too ill to go the palace, and the insignia were received by his mother two days after he died. By all accounts William Duddell was an extremely well-liked person. Descriptions of him in various obituaries refer to &#145;an unassuming and kindly man&#146;, and &#145;a man of charming courtesy&#146; with &#145;lightness of manner, approachable by all and sundry&#146;. Although his major achievements, the oscillograph and the musical arc, are no longer of any practical importance, they were crucial to the development of electrical engineering and wireless telegraphy.<br>
