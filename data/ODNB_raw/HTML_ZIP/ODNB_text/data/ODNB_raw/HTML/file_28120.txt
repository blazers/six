<span class="headword">Vassall,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1586, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born in London and baptized at Stepney on 5 June 1586, the second of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28119/', "John Vassall (d. 1625)")</script>, mariner and shipowner, and his second wife, Anna Russell (<i>d</i>. 1593) of Ratcliffe. His father was a man of French background, whose family moved to England because of the religious conflict in France. Little is known of Vassall's education or early career, though he may have been an apprentice with Abraham Cartwright, a wealthy London draper, for whom he served as a factor in Italy during the 1620s. Vassall married Cartwright's daughter, Frances, with whom he had eight children, two of whom died young.<br>
<br>During the early seventeenth century Vassall acquired extensive interests in trade, shipping, and colonial enterprise. By 1619 he was a member of the Drapers' Company, in which he served as a warden from 1636 to 1637 and as an assistant from 1636 to 1659. He was also a member of the Levant Company, serving as an assistant in 1625, 1628, and 1640. In 1628 he inherited a share of &pound;4100 in the second joint-stock of the East India Company, from his father-in-law. Much of his overseas trade was in cloth, which was exported to markets in the Mediterranean and the American colonies in exchange for goods such as currants, silk, tobacco, hemp, and flax. During the 1620s he was briefly involved in privateering, setting out the <i>Thomas</i> of London with letters of marque against France in 1627. About the same time he purchased a group of Moorish prisoners who were to be shipped as slaves to Leghorn. He regularly used his own vessels in the new transatlantic trades with Virginia and the West Indies, in occasional partnership with young city traders such as Maurice Thompson. With his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28122/', "William Vassall")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28119/', "Vassall, John")</script>], he was a founder member of the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1629, when he was elected as an assistant. In 1630, in association with his brother-in-law, Peter Andrews, he was involved in a project to establish a colony in Carolina; although the enterprise failed, as late as 1663 Vassall was defending his rights in the region.<br>
<br>Vassall was an ambitious entrepreneur, who was prepared to take risks to further his business interests. He claimed to be the sole English trader with Ragusa, where he built up a flourishing trade in high-quality cloth during the 1620s and 1630s. According to the Venetian ambassador, by the mid-1630s he was experimenting with a new fringed cloth, which other members of the Levant Company were unable to make. From Ragusa, Vassall sent most of his cloth to markets in Hungary, though he was forced out of this trade after 1636 by the city authorities of Ragusa. In December 1637 the Venetian ambassador was trying to persuade him to relocate his business to Venice, but the negotiations that followed were difficult and unsuccessful. Despite the pressure of other commitments, during the 1640s he was one of a small group of London merchants engaged in the development of the slave trade with Barbados, although his commercial ventures in west Africa led to accusations of interloping from the Guinea Company. By 1648 he was attempting to establish a trade with Brazil, under licence from the king of Portugal.<br>
<br>At key times during the 1620s and 1630s Vassall's business activities became entangled with politics. In 1627 he was imprisoned for opposing the forced loan in the City. The following year he refused to pay impositions on currants, for which he was subsequently gaoled for contempt of court. Furthermore, in 1630 he opposed the continued levy of tonnage and poundage without parliamentary approval. After refusing to pay ship money in 1635 he was imprisoned and some of his plate was seized, though it was later returned. In September 1639, during the political crisis that grew out of the Scottish war, his house was searched and a number of papers, including covenanting tracts and a remonstrance against ship money, were seized. He was arrested again in July 1640, allegedly for organizing a petition among the inhabitants of London, to be presented to the king. Later in the year he complained to parliament that he had been committed sixteen times, for which he claimed &pound;20,000 in damages for loss of trade and injury to his credit.<br>
<br>Despite little experience in City politics or administration, Vassall was elected as one of the MPs for London to the Short and Long parliaments. Throughout the 1640s he was involved in a wide range of business, supporting and promoting the cause of the parliamentary leadership against Charles I, while looking after his own interests. In October 1641 he made a speech in the Commons on behalf of the Turkey merchants, and was instrumental in the passing of a prohibition against the import of currants from Venetian territories. He was also a supporter of John Pym's proposal for a company for America and Africa. He was involved in discussions for a loan from the City to parliament in November 1641, and in sending relief to Ireland later in the year. He was appointed to serve on committees for Virginia in December 1640, and for the relief of captives in Algiers in November 1641. These official duties increased following the outbreak of the civil war. In September 1642 he became one of the commissioners for the navy. At varying times thereafter several of his ships were hired for state service, though thinly veiled charges of corruption by Andrewes Burrell were dismissed as self-interested and ill-informed. In November 1643 he was appointed to the commission for plantations. In addition he was nominated to serve on committees for levying the assessment within London in 1642; for Barbados in 1643; for regulating the price of tobacco in 1644; for the excise and the assessment for the Scottish army in 1645; for bishops' lands and scandalous offences in 1646; and for the relief of Ireland, as well as scandalous offences, in 1648. In 1644 he was a prominent witness in the trial of Archbishop William Laud. Apparently he held Laud responsible for his imprisonment for refusing to pay tonnage and poundage, and claimed that the archbishop had warned him &#145;that he did eat the bread out of the King's children's mouths; and that if he were in another country he would be hanged for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 4.102).<br>
<br>Like the other members for London, Vassall played a leading role in organizing the parliamentarian war effort in the City, not only in managing financial assessments but also in administering decrees, such as the new model ordinance of February 1645. In July 1646 he was nominated as one of the commissioners for the conservation of the peace between England and Scotland. As a supporter of the presbyterian middle group, however, he was purged from parliament in 1648. He seems to have been in difficult financial circumstances during the 1650s. In April 1654 he petitioned the lord protector for assistance, claiming not to have received any of the compensation, amounting to &pound;10,445 12<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>., that parliament had voted for him. Following further petitions to Cromwell and the council of state he was in October 1655 awarded &pound;2591 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. with interest. He continued to petition the protectorate for assistance, after receiving only &pound;1000 of this total. Both his petitions of 1654 and 1657 were printed, but in response to the latter he was told to apply to parliament for help, as there was no revenue left in Cromwell's hands to satisfy the debt. In June 1658 he was again in custody, possibly as a result of his financial situation. In February 1660 he was constituted one of the commissioners for customs in London, though the appointment was probably short-lived. Little evidence survives for Vassall's activities after 1660. He may have owned property at Bedale in Yorkshire, in addition to his landed interests in Massachusetts. He died in obscure circumstances overseas, possibly in Massachusetts, in 1667; letters of administration were granted to his son Henry on 24 October 1667, and confirmed the following month.<br>
