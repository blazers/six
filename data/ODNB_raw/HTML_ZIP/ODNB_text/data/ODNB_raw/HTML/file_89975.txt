<span class="headword">Fraser, Sir  Ian James</span>  (1923&#150;2003), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 7 August 1923 at Moniack Castle, Kirkhill, Inverness-shire, the second of four sons and fourth of the six children of Alastair Thomas Joseph Fraser (1877&#150;1949), mining engineer and fourth son of Simon Fraser, thirteenth Lord Lovat, and his wife, Lady Sibyl, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grimston (1887&#150;1968), fifth daughter of James Walter Grimston, third earl of Verulam. Simon Joseph Fraser, fourteenth Lord Lovat, was his uncle. He was educated at Ampleforth College and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read classics for a year and obtained a third in classical moderations in 1942. After leaving Oxford that year he served for the remainder of the Second World War as a lieutenant in the Scots Guards, advancing arduously through Italy. He was captured&#151;and escaped&#151;and was several times wounded; in 1945 he was awarded the Military Cross for leading an attack on a German gun position. He considered himself fortunate to have survived the war, unlike many classmates and friends, and attributed his career success partly to the decimation of his age cohort.<br>
<br>Fraser returned to Oxford on demobilization but was restless and decided that he wanted to earn a living. In 1946 he joined Reuters, the news agency, and worked first in Paris and then Berlin. At the border check-point between the British and Soviet zones he had his first encounter with Captain Robert Maxwell. Fraser uncovered Maxwell's smuggling activities (for which Maxwell used his position in the occupying forces and a false press pass) but the expos&eacute; was suppressed by the authorities. As Reuters' chief correspondent in Bonn from 1951 Fraser witnessed the rebuilding of the shattered German economy and made friends among Germany's new governing class.<br>
<br>Fraser's familiarity with post-war Germany and its leaders and his linguistic abilities&#151;he spoke flawless German and excellent French and Italian&#151;were his passport to a new career in the City. In 1956 he was hired as personal assistant to Siegmund Warburg, the &eacute;migr&eacute; founder of the merchant bank Warburgs. Another new turn was his marriage on 25 October 1958 to (Evelyn Elizabeth) Anne Grant (<i>d</i>. 1984), the 20-year-old daughter of Alistair Edward George Grant, army officer. They had two sons and two daughters. The same year Warburgs rocked the British establishment by organizing a takeover bid for British Aluminium&#151;an episode that introduced the hostile takeover bid to the City and announced the arrival of Warburgs as a force to be reckoned with.<br>
<br>Warburgs' second major innovation was the Eurobond&#151;long-term securities issued in London but denominated in dollars or other &#145;offshore&#146; (non-sterling) currencies. The issue that launched the Eurobond market was a loan for Autostrade Italiane, the Italian motorway operator, in July 1963. Fraser was a leading member of the team that spent months blazing a path through the tangle of official and market regulations and tax problems. Once launched, the Eurobond market boomed, rapidly becoming the biggest and most dynamic dimension of the international capital market and a vital factor in the City's post-war revival. Fraser played a key role in keeping Warburgs at the forefront of the Eurobond business; in 1966 he made fifty-eight overseas trips in pursuit of new business and he brought the first Japanese borrowers to the market. But he was also active on the corporate advisory side of Warburgs' business, conducting a series of acquisitions on behalf of the buccaneering Roland (Tiny) Rowland of Lonhro as well as other clients.<br>
<br>At the invitation of the governor of the Bank of England, Leslie O'Brien, in 1969 Fraser became director-general of the newly beefed-up Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, whose purpose was to police takeovers. The panel's first major test was to adjudicate in an acrimonious merger dispute between Leasco and Pergamon Press, which was controlled by Robert Maxwell. Fraser's ruling in Leasco's favour led to threats from Maxwell and an extraordinary display of bombast and histrionics at the appeal hearing&#151;but Fraser prevailed. The episode established the authority of the Takeover Panel and boosted the prestige of City self-regulation, helping it to survive until the mid-1980s.<br>
<br>On leaving the Takeover Panel in 1972 Fraser joined Lazard Brothers, a venerable merchant bank, of which he was deputy chairman from 1974 and chairman from 1980. Under his leadership the firm developed greater discipline and dynamism, and closer co-operation with the Lazard houses in New York and Paris. While other merchant banks diversified their activities in the 1980s during the City's &#145;big bang&#146;, Lazards stuck to corporate advisory work, prospering in this role and, unlike most of its peers, retained its independence.<br>
<br>For two decades, from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, Fraser was a leading figure in the City and beyond. Other appointments included the chairmanship of Rolls-Royce from 1971 to 1980, and a host of directorships including Vickers, TSB, Pearson, BOC, Chloride, and EMI. The key to his career success was his formidable analytical intelligence and a very quick mind. He had no tolerance for stupidity, phoniness, or dishonesty, leading some to perceive him as arrogant, but friends recalled his sense of fun and a deep streak of kindness. He retired in 1985 and was knighted in 1986 (having been appointed CBE in 1972). Following the death of his first wife in 1984, on 25 June 1993 he married Fiona Margaret Martin (<i>b</i>. 1936), the daughter of Henry Montagu Douglas-Home, army officer, and former wife of Gregory Martin. His retirement was marred by ill health, and by membership of a Lloyd's underwriting syndicate that sustained crippling losses; he was chairman of the Lloyd's Syndicate 90 (1982) Names Association from 1990 to 1996. He died at Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton, Somerset, near his home, South Haddon Farm, Skilgate, Taunton, on 8 May 2003, of heart and renal failure. He was survived by his wife, Fiona, and the four children of his first marriage.<br>
