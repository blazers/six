<span class="headword">Piatti,  Alfredo Carlo</span>  (1822&#150;1901), <span class="occ">cellist and cello teacher</span>, was born on 8 January 1822 in the via Borga Canale, Bergamo, Italy, the first of two children born to Antonio Piatti (<i>b</i>. 1801), a violinist, and his wife, Marianna Marchetti (<i>c</i>.1805&#150;<i>c</i>.1822). His father led the orchestra in Bergamo, and at the age of five Piatti began to study with its principal cellist, his great-uncle Gaetano Zanetti. When he was seven he joined the orchestra as an unpaid member, and a year later he replaced his deceased uncle. In 1832 he entered the conservatory at Milan. His studies there with Vincenzo Merighi (1795&#150;1849) culminated in his graduation performance on 21 September 1837. He then returned to Bergamo as a permanent player in the orchestra and also toured locally as a soloist. Work in Vienna and Turin ensued and, after returning to his home town once again, Piatti took a post in Milan without permission and was dismissed from the Bergamo orchestra.<br>
<br>Having played in Munich with Liszt, who subsequently presented him with an Amati cello, Piatti began to travel further afield. In 1844 he appeared in Paris and also paid his first visit to London, where he made his public d&eacute;but in Lucy Anderson's Annual Grand Morning Concert at Her Majesty's Theatre on 31 May. The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> pronounced that &#145;his certainty and precision were unerring&#146;. Piatti presented a fantasia by Kummer on 24 June at his first Philharmonic Society engagement; Mendelssohn, who also performed, began work on a cello concerto for Piatti, which is now lost. In 1844&#150;5 he toured the British Isles, Milan, and St Petersburg. After returning to England in 1846 his engagements included work for the Italian Opera, the Beethoven Quartet Society, the National Concerts, and the Sacred Harmonic Society, where his short, bespectacled figure became familiar and well loved by audiences. His earnest, tasteful approach, fine tone, and cantabile lines, produced from an instrument without endpin, were considered to be unsurpassed. He was particularly revered for his chamber music performances.<br>
<br>Piatti's name became inextricably linked with the other great performers of the day, including Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, Charles Hall&eacute;, Ludwig Straus, and Bottesini. Composers, including Sterndale Bennett, Sullivan, and Molique, wrote works expressly for him. Piatti's own compositions included the <span class="italic">Twelve Caprices</span> (op. 25), songs with cello obbligato, a concertino (op. 18), two concertos (opp. 24 and 26), a <span class="italic">Fantasia romantica</span>, six sonatas, and a serenata for two cellos. He taught privately and at the Royal Academy of Music, and his pupils included William Whitehouse, Robert Hausmann, Leo Stern, Hugo Becker, and Squire. He made a vital contribution to the cello repertory in producing editions of works by Locatelli, Marcello, Valentini, Veracini, Boccherini, Porpora, Ariosti, J. S. Bach, and C. Simpson, and his cello method was widely used and later updated. On 27 March 1855 Piatti married Mary Anne Lucy Welsh (<i>b</i>. 1828/9), the daughter of Thomas Welsh, a professor of singing. Of their four children, only one daughter survived to adulthood. The unhappy marriage ended in separation. Piatti resided at 51 Stanhope Street, then in Queens Gardens, and then, for the last twenty years of his life, at 15 Northwick Terrace, St John's Wood.<br>
<br>In 1867 Piatti was given a fine 1720 Stradivarius, which became known as &#145;the Piatti&#146;. He became principal cellist for the Musical Union, and composed the <span class="italic">Six Sonatas for Violoncello and Pianoforte</span> (1885&#150;96) for Chappell's Monday Popular Concerts, at which he was principal cellist from 1859 to 1898. On 22 March 1894 he and Joachim were presented with a testimonial at the Grafton Galleries to celebrate the jubilee of their London d&eacute;buts. In the autumn of 1898, at a music festival celebrating the centenary of Donizetti's birth, held in Bergamo, the king of Italy conferred the rank of commendatore della Corona d'Italia on Piatti. After his retirement in 1898, owing to ill health, Piatti lived with his daughter, Countess Rosa Lochis, at Crocetta di Mozzo, near Bergamo. He died there on 18 July 1901. A public funeral took place on 22 July and his body was interred at the Lochis family chapel.<br>
