<span class="headword">Burt, Sir  Archibald Paull</span>  (1810&#150;1879), <span class="occ">colonial judge</span>, was born on 1 September 1810 in St Kitts, the second son and second of the seven children of George Henry Burt (1787&#150;1851), sugar planter, merchant, and speaker of the house of assembly of St Kitts, and his wife, Eliza Anne (1787&#150;1835), only child of William McTair and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Earle. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Colonel William Burt, who sailed from England to the West Indies in 1635 and started a dynasty of colonial administrators.<br>
<br>Burt was sent by his father across the Atlantic to a private school in Richmond, Surrey, and was admitted to the Middle Temple to study law on 12 April 1825, at the age of fourteen, but was not called to the English bar until 1845. However, his Middle Temple qualification was sufficient for his admission to the St Kitts bar when he returned to the island in 1830. He built up a successful legal practice and also formed a trading partnership with another barrister, Francis Spencer Wigley. Their earnings as barristers enabled them to invest in a number of sugar estates. When slavery was abolished in 1834, Burt, already a member of the house of assembly, owned three slaves: a washerwoman aged forty called Sarah; a twelve-year-old house servant called John; and a one-year-old baby. On 4 June 1836, at St George's, Basseterre, Burt married Louisa Emily (1814&#150;1870), only daughter of Dr John Bryan. They had twelve children, two of whom died in infancy. By 1837 Burt had taken silk. He became a member of the legislative and executive councils and of the administrative committee of St Kitts and later followed in his father's footsteps, becoming speaker of the house of assembly. A leading layman in the Church of England, he was chancellor of the diocese of Antigua between 1855 and 1860.<br>
<br>In 1848 Burt was provisionally appointed attorney-general of St Kitts, and the following year the appointment was confirmed, the lieutenant-governor having told the governor:<blockquote>Of unblemished private character Mr Burt unites many qualities which befit a servant of the Crown &hellip; he is endowed with considerable power of application to business as well as with that sound sense and equal temper that are peculiarly wanted in this office. (Robert James Mackintosh to James Macaulay Higginson, 5 Sept 1849, TNA: PRO, CO 239/99, no. 44, 10823/56)</blockquote>The salary was &pound;300 a year, half that paid to the chief justice, who in 1856 died of apoplexy while sitting on the bench. The new lieutenant-governor wanted to appoint Burt to the vacant chief justiceship, but the governor vetoed the appointment, arguing that someone should not be appointed to the bench in a colony where he had practised and been resident. Nevertheless the lieutenant-governor continued to press for Burt's appointment, referring to his &#145;high legal reputation and great talent, probably equal to if not greater than that of any lawyer in the West Indies, and also the unbounded esteem in which he is held in this community&#146;  (Hercules Robinson to Ker Baillie Hamilton, 17 Nov 1856, TNA: PRO, CO 239/99, no. 61, 11348/56). Acrimonious letters were exchanged, and the governor sought the support of the secretary of state, knowing that it was unlikely that his decision would be countermanded. The refusal of Burt's appointment was confirmed, but the Colonial Office seems to have realized that an injustice had been done to Burt and the secretary of state for the colonies was soon writing about a vacancy on the Jamaican bench, suggesting that it &#145;could be made available for the promotion of Mr Burt&#146;  (Henry Labouchere to Ker Baillie Hamilton, 31 Jan 1857, TNA: PRO, CO 239/103, no. 69, 6383/59). It was then found that in Jamaica a lawyer could not become a judge unless he had practised at the Jamaican or English bar, the converse of the position in the Leeward Islands. With apparently no prospect of promotion in the West Indies, Burt wrote to the Colonial Office, indicating his willingness &#145;to serve the Crown in any of Her Majesty's possessions&#146;  (Burt to the duke of Newcastle, 20 June 1859, TNA: PRO, CO 239/103, no. 5, 6383). A year later he was offered and accepted the position of civil commissioner and chairman of quarter sessions in Western Australia.<br>
<br>Burt uprooted himself from St Kitts, leaving in June 1860 and travelling via Southampton to Australia, arriving at Fremantle on 29 January 1861. Before he left St Kitts, the house of assembly unanimously voted him a gift of &pound;500 as a mark of esteem; 750 people signed an address praising his service to the island, concluding &#145;in you, the poor and distressed will lose a friend and a father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Illustrated News of the World</span>, 22 Sept 1860); and a public meeting presented him with a purse with which to buy, when he reached London, a candelabrum. Five months after his arrival in Fremantle Burt became Western Australia's first chief justice. He was a sympathetic and humane judge, particularly considerate towards the interests of the Aborigines and concerned at their mistreatment. He became a trusted adviser of the governors of the colony and was very much the Victorian paterfamilias, faithful to the Anglican church and a figure of dignity whose word was law not only in his court but also at home. Burt found social conditions in the Swan River settlement somewhat less orderly and predictable than they had been in St Kitts, and he ordered from London a revolver as well as four tweed suits. His opinion that all who came before him were equal and entitled to the same fair treatment frequently brought him into conflict with the views of the settler establishment. Particularly notable was his role in the 1872 case of <i>R. v. Burges</i>, in which the latter was accused of murdering an Aborigine. The jury found Burges guilty of manslaughter, but Burt sentenced him to five years' imprisonment, declaring that the prisoner's acts had retarded peaceful colonization. The colonists were outraged, and the newspapers portrayed Burges as a martyr.<br>
<br>In 1870 Burt was devastated by the death of his wife. In 1871 his second son died of a fever, aged thirty-three. Four days later his daughter-in-law died, aged thirty-four. Just over a month later, his tenth son died of typhoid, aged seventeen. The month after that his brother-in-law and business partner, Francis Spencer Wigley, died. Weighed down by personal sorrow and public criticism, Burt applied in July 1873 for leave of absence to return to St Kitts to try to salvage the affairs of the partnership into which he had entered with Wigley. But his attempt was unsuccessful, and the partnership was declared bankrupt. At the end of 1873, a year otherwise full of misery, there was some consolation. He was awarded a knighthood and was dubbed by Queen Victoria herself on 12 December. He returned to Perth in 1874, strengthened by the Colonial Office's confidence in him, but his relations with the press continued to be strained, as were his relations with the crown solicitor and the attorney-general.<br>
<br>In November 1879 Burt contracted a leg infection, which developed into erysipelas, and he died at his home, Strawberry Hill, Adelaide Terrace, Perth, on 21 November. The union jack was flown at half-mast on the town hall tower, all public offices were closed, the bells of all the city's churches were tolled, and the previously hostile newspapers paid tribute to &#145;a courteous gentleman of unimpeachable integrity&#146;  (Morling, 7). The funeral on 23 November was one of the largest ever seen in Perth, and his coffin was placed in the family vault at East Perth cemetery. J. M. Bennett, an Australian legal historian, later described Burt as<blockquote>a commanding lawyer and a man of great independence and diligence, well versed in all aspects of colonial administration &hellip; So strong were the foundations on which he set the law and its institutions in the colony that they survived the mischief worked by lesser lawyers who succeeded him in the nineteenth century. (Bennett, dust jacket)</blockquote>
