<span class="headword">Smyth,  Reginald</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Reg Smythe]</span>  (1917&#150;1998), <span class="occ">cartoonist</span>, was born on 10 July 1917 at 52 Union Road, Throston, Hartlepool, co. Durham, the son of Richard Oliver Smyth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1949), shipyard worker, and his wife, Florence (Florrie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pearce. Educated at Galley's Field School, West Hartlepool, he left school at fourteen and worked as a butcher's errand boy. After spending some time in unemployment he joined the Northumberland Fusiliers, with whom he served for ten years and rose to the rank of sergeant. He was a machine-gunner and saw active service in north Africa during the Second World War. There he developed an interest in drawing by designing posters for amateur dramatic productions.<br>
<br>After leaving the forces Smyth settled in London, working as a clerk with the General Post Office (GPO). On 13 August 1949 he married Vera (1916/17&#150;1997), the daughter of George Toyne, woodworker, and formerly the wife of Herbert Whittaker. There were no children of the marriage. While working for the GPO, Smyth again produced posters for amateur plays, but by the early 1950s he had moved to creating cartoons and began to work through an agent. It was at this time that he took up the pen name Reg Smythe. By 1954 he was working for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, designing cartoons for the &#145;Laughter at Work&#146; series, under the mentorship of Leslie Harding (Styx). This led to full-time employment at the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> and, in 1957, to the birth of his great creation, Andy Capp.<br>
<br>According to Smyth, Andy Capp was born &#145;on the A1 road at 60 mph&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). While on a visit to West Hartlepool, Smyth had received a request from the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> to create a cartoon to boost northern readership, and Capp was created as he returned southwards to work. The rise to fame of his creation was staggering. First appearing in the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s northern edition in 1957 the cartoon swiftly went national in 1958. In the same year the first Andy Capp compilation was also published. By 1960 an Andy Capp strip cartoon was appearing seven days a week&#151;six days in the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> and one in its sister paper, the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>. Andy's rise to international fame was even more sensational. He appeared in at least 34 countries and 700 newspapers, with text in 13 or more languages. He was Tuffa Viktor in Sweden, Willi Wakker in Germany, Andr&eacute; Chapeau in France, and Kasket Karl in Denmark, where small, cigarette-smoking models were snapped up in the early 1960s. Smyth's creation brought him numerous awards, including &#145;Best British cartoon strip&#146; annually from 1961 to 1965. This honour was awarded by the Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain, of which Smyth was a founding member. He won three major awards in Italy&#151;in 1969, 1973, and 1978&#151;and the prestigious US &#145;Best strip&#146; cartoon award in 1974.<br>
<br>Hugh Cudlipp of the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, the man who persuaded Smyth to create Andy Capp, described the cartoon character succinctly as &#145;a work-shy, beer-swilling, rent-dodging, wife-beating, pigeon-fancying, soccer-playing, uncouth cadger, setting an appalling example to the youth of Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). It is perhaps Capp's very political incorrectness that made him wickedly appealing. Smyth said on more than one occasion that Andy and his equally infamous wife, Flo, were based on his own parents. In his personal love of a pint of beer and a cigarette&#151;until 1983, when he gave up smoking&#151;Smyth had something in common with his &#145;offspring&#146;. Andy Capp's ventures off the printed page proved less successful. There was a West End musical and a television series that commenced in 1988, scripted by Keith Waterhouse, but neither had any lasting effect. Some pundits felt that the opportunity for a successful cartoon television series had been missed.<br>
<br>Smyth was a very private man. At the height of his success he returned to his native Hartlepool, living and working quietly in a secluded bungalow in the middle of a large estate&#151;&#145;reserved to the point of being a recluse&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>). Following the death of his wife in 1997 he married, on 21 May 1998, a widow, Jean Marie Glynn (<i>b</i>. 1928/9), daughter of Thomas Barry, labourer. Smyth died at his home, 96 Caledonian Road, Hartlepool, on 13 June 1998, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife. Typically for a professional described as a &#145;one off&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>) he left a year's worth of cartoons to his employers.<br>
