<span class="headword">McFall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clarke]</span>,  Frances Elizabeth Bellenden</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Sarah Grand]</span>  (1854&#150;1943), <span class="occ">novelist and women's rights campaigner</span>, was born on 10 June 1854 in Donaghadee, co. Down, Ireland, the fourth of the five children of Edward John Bellenden Clarke (1813&#150;1861), a lieutenant in the Royal Navy and coastguard, and his wife, Margaret Bell Sherwood (1813&#150;1874). Both parents were English, and after the death of her father in 1861, Clarke and her family moved to near Scarborough, Yorkshire, to be near her mother's relatives. Educated at home until the age of fourteen, she had two years of formal schooling, first at the Royal Naval School at Twickenham, Middlesex, and then at a finishing school in Holland Road, Kensington, London. Viewing marriage as her only opportunity to continue her education, on 23 August 1870 she married David Chambers McFall (1834/5&#150;1898), an army surgeon attached to the Indian border regiment. He was about twenty years her senior, a widower with two sons, Haldane (who was only six years younger than Clarke) and Albert. Frances McFall's only child, David Archibald Edward (Archie) McFall, who became an actor, was born on 7 October 1871. From 1873 to 1878 she travelled with her husband and son to Singapore, Ceylon, China, Japan, and the Straits Settlements. In 1879 they moved to Norwich, where David McFall was stationed, and then in 1881 moved to Warrington, Lancashire, where he retired as honorary brigade surgeon. Their marriage was not a happy one, and in 1890 she left her husband and son and moved to London to pursue her writing career.<br>
<br>McFall's first book, <span class="italic">Two Dear Little Feet</span>, a cautionary tale about the dangers of fashionably tight boots, was published in 1873, but after that she had little success in getting her early fiction published. In 1888 she published her first novel, <span class="italic">Ideala: a Study from Life</span>, anonymously and at her own expense. The success of <span class="italic">Ideala</span> (which was republished by Bentley in 1889) gave her the courage and the resources to live on her own. From the beginning her desire to write was inseparable from her desire to instruct and reform. Profoundly influenced by Josephine Butler's campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, she was intent upon educating her readers about any and all issues she felt pertinent to the well-being and advancement of women. In her novel <span class="italic">The Heavenly Twins</span>, published under the pseudonym Sarah Grand, she condemned the sexual double standard, argued for more opportunities and independence for women, and criticized gender-role socialization. But her central subject was the spread of syphilis from men to their wives and children; the disease's destructive effects are represented with clinical detail, presumably gleaned from her husband's medical textbooks. Not surprisingly the novel was rejected by numerous publishers, but when Heinemann published it in 1893 it became a sensational best-seller. It was reprinted six times in its first year and sold over 20,000 copies by its second year in print. It was condemned on moral grounds and criticized for its confusing narrative structure, but it was praised by Mark Twain and George Bernard Shaw and thrilled a reading public eager for fiction that dealt in a frank manner with sexuality and the issues of the day. It was the first of what came to be called &#145;new woman&#146; novels (McFall claimed to have coined the term &#145;new woman&#146;) which depicted women's growing dissatisfaction with the restrictions of Victorian society.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Heavenly Twins</span> changed McFall's life. With it was born the persona of Sarah Grand, often called &#145;Madame&#146; Grand, a self-styled &#145;woman of genius&#146;, who was impeccably dressed, had a charming manner, and wore distinctively large hats, and who lectured and wrote on women's issues for the next two decades. McFall's philosophy was moderate in nature: she advocated marriage and contested the sexual double standard by demanding sexual purity for men as well as women. She believed that this very moderation, combined with her witty and calculatedly feminine style, would do more for women than the militant agenda and tactics of the suffragettes. In 1901 she went on a four-month lecture tour of the United States, and from 1903 to 1912 she lectured throughout England and published numerous articles promoting women's suffrage as well as rational dress and the benefits of bicycling for women. She was a member of the Women Writers' Suffrage League and the Women Citizens' Association, and vice-president of the Women's Suffrage Society. After moving to Tunbridge Wells in 1898, she became president of the local branches of the National Council of Women and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies.<br>
<br>Although McFall continued to write fiction, none of her other novels matched the success or generated the controversy of <span class="italic">The Heavenly Twins</span>. Her autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">The Beth Book</span> (1897), contains some of her best writing in its first half, which vividly depicts the deprivations of the heroine's childhood and boldly describes the awakening of her sexuality. But like <span class="italic">The Heavenly Twins</span> it is overly long and tackles too many topics, including vivisection, lock hospitals, and the abuse of caffeine. She turned her attention to land reform and sweatshops in her last two novels, <span class="italic">Adnam's Orchard</span> (1912) and <span class="italic">The Winged Victory</span> (1916).<br>
<br>After women got the vote in 1918, McFall's celebrity quickly faded. By 1922 most of her books were out of print. She often responded to formal criticism of her writing by saying that matter meant more to her than manner, but by being tied so closely to the issues and controversies of her age, the matter of her novels eventually lost its relevance. In the 1970s interest in McFall's work was revived by feminist literary criticism, but her passionate and well-intentioned novels&#151;unwieldy, proselytizing, often tiresome in their detail and length&#151;remain of interest primarily as historical documents.<br>
<br>After living in Tunbridge Wells with her stepson, the artist and writer Haldane McFall, for twenty years, Frances McFall moved to Bath in 1920. There she turned her considerable energies towards civic duties, taking on the largely ceremonial post of the city's lady mayoress from 1922 to 1929 (excluding the years 1923 and 1924), serving with Mayor Cedric Chivers, a widower and businessman. When Bath was bombed in 1942, relatives persuaded her, with difficulty, to leave her damaged home and move to Calne, Wiltshire. McFall died there at her home, The Grange, on 12 May 1943 and was buried on 15 May in Lansdown cemetery, Bath.<br>
