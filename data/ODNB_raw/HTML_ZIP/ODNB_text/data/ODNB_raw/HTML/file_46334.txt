<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sangster,  William Edwin Robert</span>  (1900&#150;1960), <span class="occ">Methodist minister and writer</span>, was born on 5 June 1900 at 3 Edmund's Place, near City Road, in London, one of the five children of Henry George Sangster (1872&#150;1931), foreman at a collar-box factory, and his wife, Martha Deal (1871&#150;1954). His parents did not attend church; &#145;they were&#146;, as Sangster stated, &#145;devoted Church of England, but just stayed away&#146;  (P. Sangster, 26). He received his early education at Holy Trinity church school (1903&#150;9), before obtaining a scholarship for Shoreditch secondary school, where he was a pupil until 1915.<br>
<br>From 1909 Sangster began to attend the Methodist mission hall on Radnor Street, London, where he underwent an evangelical conversion experience in 1913 and met Margaret Conway, whom he later married in 1926. On leaving school at the age of fifteen he commenced work as an office boy at a London accountancy firm. In 1917 he became a fully accredited local preacher.<br>
<br>In June 1918 Sangster joined the army and began serving with the Queen's Royal West Surrey regiment, quickly gaining the rank of corporal and sergeant. In 1920 he attended Handsworth College, Birmingham, and later Richmond College, in Surrey, to train as a Methodist minister. He served as a probationer minister at County Road Methodist Church, Liverpool, in April 1923, and then, three months later, at Littlehampton, Sussex. On 27 July 1926 he was ordained in Wesley Chapel, Priory Street, York. Sangster served as minister at Conwy, Caernarvonshire and Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire (1926&#150;9), during which time his wife gave birth to twins. He gained an external London University degree in philosophy, and then ministered at Fazakerley and Aintree, Liverpool (1929&#150;32). In 1931, due to overwork and doubts about his sincerity as a Christian, he experienced a spiritual crisis culminating in a total commitment to God and his first publication, <span class="italic">Why Jesus Never Wrote a Book</span>. Now more effective as both a preacher and a pastor, he was appointed minister at the Queen Street Central Hall, Scarborough (1932&#150;6), and Brunswick Church, Leeds (1936&#150;9). While at Leeds he worked also on the BBC northern region religious advisory committee and as a British representative to the General Conference of the Canadian Churches. From 1939 he was the minister of the Westminster Central Hall, regularly sharing pulpits with Dr Leslie Weatherhead and Donald Soper. During the war years Sangster supervised the air-raid shelters in the Westminster area, using the basement of the hall as a centre of both social and evangelistic activities. He was awarded a doctorate by the University of London in 1942 for his thesis on Christian perfection, later published as <span class="italic">The Path to Perfection</span> (1943).<br>
<br>In the post-war period Sangster travelled to America on several occasions and made a world tour, rapidly becoming one of the most influential preachers of his day, his reputation reaching far beyond denominational barriers at home and abroad. As an ecumenicist he served on the Methodist delegation which met to discuss closer relations with the Anglican church, and was involved in the Free Church Federal Council and the National Sunday School Union.<br>
<br>A regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Empire News</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, and other newspapers, Sangster criticized the &#145;moral rottenness&#146; of the nation, calling for a &#145;new penitence&#146; among the people. In 1953 he made headline news with a sermon entitled &#145;What would a revival of religion do for Britain?&#146;, in which he argued that faith in Jesus Christ was the ultimate panacea for the problems of modern Britain.<br>
<br>Sangster served as president of the Methodist conference in 1950 and was involved in the work of the Evangelical Alliance, various evangelistic campaigns with Billy Graham and other speakers, and, with the Africa Bureau, in taking a stand against apartheid. He helped found the Christian Publicity Organisation, which attempted to use advertising as a means of evangelism. He was also involved in the formation of the Prayer Life Movement: this set out to establish prayer groups throughout Britain and other countries, with a view to religious revival.<br>
<br>After leaving Westminster Hall in 1955, Sangster worked as general secretary of the Methodist home mission department. He was also for several years a member of the senate of London University. A prolific writer, he was best known for his two books on preaching: <span class="italic">The Craft of Sermon Illustration</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">The Craft of Sermon Construction</span> (1949), later republished in one volume as <span class="italic">The Craft of the Sermon</span> (1954). His numerous devotional books include <span class="italic">God does Guide Us</span> (1934), <span class="italic">He is Able</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">The Secret of Radiant Life</span> (1957). His two-volume <span class="italic">Westminster Sermons</span> (1960&#150;61) proved to be of use to both minister and lay person alike. Throughout the 1950s he published the <span class="roman">Westminster Pamphlets</span>, a series of tracts aimed at providing the &#145;spiritual check-up of ourselves and our churches&#146;.<br>
<br>Although at times Sangster could appear domineering and imperious, he was a man of piety, dignity, and vitality, possessing &#145;a colourful and dynamic personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minutes of Conference</span>). In appearance he had &#145;a strong, erect figure&#146; and, especially in later life, had a &#145;striking mane of grey-white hair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sangster of Westminster</span>, 28). From 1957 Sangster's health was steadily deteriorating. He was diagnosed as suffering from progressive muscular atrophy. He died at his home, 52 Lyford Road, Wandsworth, London, on 24 May 1960. He was survived by his wife.<br>
