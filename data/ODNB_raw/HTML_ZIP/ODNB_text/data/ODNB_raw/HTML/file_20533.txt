<span class="headword">&Oacute; D&aacute;laigh,  Aonghus</span> <span class="st"> [Aengus O'Daly; <em>called </em>Aonghus na n-Aor, an Bard Ruadh]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1617), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the author of <span class="italic">Muintir fhiodhnacha na mionn</span>, a long series of satirical quatrains on numerous Gaelic clerical and noble families. Although at least three well-known poets called Aonghus &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh flourished <i>c</i>.1600, oral tradition locates the satirist as having lived on the Muntervary peninsula between Dunmanus Bay and Bantry Bay, co. Cork. This was the home of &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Cairbreach, head of a cadet branch of the poetic dynasty of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54668/', "&#211; D&#225;laigh")</script>. In 1852 substantial remains of the &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Cairbreach school were still pointed out in the townland of Drumnea, parish of Kilcrohane, whereas tradition identified a smaller ruin in the townland of Corra, once part of a larger townland of Ballyroon, as the house of the Bard Ruadh. On these grounds Edward O'Reilly identified the Bard Ruadh with the Aonghus &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh of &#145;Ballyorroone&#146;, recorded in an inquisition at Old Castle in Cork (18 September 1624) as having died on 16 December 1617 (possibly in Ballyroon), leaving a legitimate son, Aonghus &Oacute;g &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh.<br>
<br>T. F. O'Rahilly argued that &#145;Eneas keaghe O Daly of Moyntervarye&#146; mentioned in a fiant of 31 August 1590 was also a reference to the Bard Ruadh, though the adjective &#145;keaghe&#146;, <i>caoch</i>, &#145;squinting&#146; or &#145;one-eyed&#146; is not otherwise associated with the satirist. More convincingly, O'Rahilly cited a co. Cork reference in the patent rolls of James I  (p. 32a) to &#145;Eneas Odaly otherwise Odaly of Cahir, yeoman&#146; in 1604. The townland of Caher adjoins the modern townland of Ballyroon on the Muntervary peninsula, and the wording indicates that Aonghus became head of his kindred.<br>
<br>The number of families lampooned in the only composition to be firmly associated with this author is too great to be explained by personal animus. O'Reilly retailed a theory that these scurrilous verses, in loose <i>&oacute;glachas</i> metres, were commissioned by &#145;the agents of the Earl of Essex and Sir George Carew&#146;  (O'Reilly, clxxvii), but this is difficult to believe, since the verses actually eulogize rather than satirize the arch-rebel &Oacute; Domhnaill and Mac Cana of north Armagh, and it is noteworthy that the rebellious M&aacute;g Uidhir chiefs of Fermanagh are passed over, while &#145;the English Maguire&#146;, Sir Conchobhar Ruadh, is savagely attacked. &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh's remark that should he satirize the &Oacute; Domhnaill dynasty of Donegal, &#145;the race of Adam would not be a shelter to me&#146;  (O'Donovan, 55), suggests the years 1599&#150;1600 as the date of composition, when &Oacute; Domhnaill's troops were ravaging Munster. Like the hasty eulogy to &Oacute; Domhnaill composed by Maoil&iacute;n &Oacute;g Mac Bruaideadha, &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh's lampoons could have been composed for the practical purpose of earning protection against the Ulster army, by ridiculing families in various parts of Ireland who had offended &Oacute; Domhnaill by failing to support his uprising. However, as O'Donovan points out, the manuscripts containing the satires are late and full of variations, and as the style of versification is so crude, additional verses against particular families could have been added in the course of transmission.<br>
