<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anderson, Dame  Adelaide Mary</span>  (1863&#150;1936), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 8 April 1863 in Melbourne, Australia, the eldest child in the large family of Alexander Gavin Anderson, a Scottish shipbroker, and his wife, Blanche Emily Campbell. Her grandfather was Dr Alexander Anderson, principal of the Gymnasium of Old Aberdeen. The family later returned to Britain and settled in London. She was educated at home by governesses and later attended schools in France and Germany as well as Queen's College, Harley Street, London. She went to Girton College, Cambridge, where she was awarded the Gamble gold medal and took second-class honours in the moral sciences tripos (1887). She then lectured on philosophy and economics for the Women's Co-operative Guild. This introduction to the harshness of working women's lives was formative and determined her choice of career.<br>
<br>In 1894, having gained valuable experience as a clerk on the staff of the royal commission on labour (1892&#150;4), Anderson followed several colleagues from the royal commission into the newly created post of lady factory inspector in the factory department of the Home Office. In 1897 she was appointed principal lady inspector of factories and was given the task of heading the newly constituted women's branch. Women inspectors were responsible for enforcing protective legislation as it applied to women and children working in factories and workshops (whose interests, it was felt, had been neglected by men inspectors), and they paid particular attention to excessive hours, poor sanitation, dangerous conditions, illegal stoppages from wages, payment in kind, and exploitation of child labour. The work of women inspectors was hived off from the men's, and tensions arising from the delineation of boundaries and the working out of chains of command meant that relations were not always harmonious between the women's and men's branches of the inspectorate.<br>
<br>As principal lady inspector Anderson sought to create a rational framework for inspection while preserving the independence and enlarging the sphere of activity of the women's branch. Anderson met the demands of an expanding workload, chronic understaffing, and excessive travelling on her inspectors by moving the women's branch towards an approximation of the organization of the men's branch&#151;though always under her own control. Initially women inspectors worked directly from London and were peripatetic, assigned to investigations in various parts of the country on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Following the creation of two experimental special districts (west London and Potteries) in 1899 and 1903 respectively, in 1908 women inspectors were assigned to residential divisions along lines similar to but independent of the men's divisions. The notable successes of the women's branch under Anderson's leadership, particularly women inspectors' substitution for men inspectors during the First World War, paradoxically led to the demise of the women's branch in 1921, when women and men inspectors were fused into an integrated inspectorate. Anderson's heart was not in these changes, and she retired the same year. She later published an account of the work of the women's branch in <span class="italic">Women in the Factory: an Administrative Adventure, 1893&#150;1921</span> (1922).<br>
<br>In retirement Anderson travelled extensively and continued her work for women and children in an international context. She was a member of the municipal council of the international settlement of Shanghai's commission on child labour (1923&#150;4) and published an account of her experiences in <span class="italic">Humanity and Labour in China: an Industrial Visit and its Sequel, 1923&#150;1926</span> (1928). She was appointed to the Foreign Office's advisory committee on the Boxer indemnity fund in 1925, and made two further visits to China (1926 and 1930&#150;31), the latter as a member of the International Labour Organization's advisory mission to assist with the creation of a factory inspectorate. Sandwiched between these trips to China she investigated child labour in Egypt in 1930 under the auspices of the International Association for Social Progress and the International Labour Organization.<br>
<br>Anderson, who was always accompanied by an umbrella and a bag bulging with papers and letters, gave an impression of philosophical detachment. She was, however, a wholehearted feminist who found her m&eacute;tier among blue books and red tape. She was indomitable in her determination and tireless in her efforts to serve the women and children who were her special charge. She was appointed CBE in 1918 and DBE in 1921. She never married. She died on 28 August 1936 at a nursing home at 39 Royal Avenue, Chelsea, London.<br>
