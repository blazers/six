<span class="headword">Mary II</span>  (1662&#150;1694), <span class="occ">queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland</span>, was born on 30 April 1662 in St James's Palace. She was the eldest child of James, duke of York, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14593/', "James II (1633&#150;1701)")</script>, and his first wife, Anne Hyde [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14325/', "Anne (1637&#150;1671)")</script>]. Her maternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14328/', "Edward Hyde, first earl of Clarendon")</script>, architect of the restoration of Charles II. She was named after her aunt, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18252/', "Mary, princess of Orange")</script>, who had recently died. At her baptism her godparents were Prince Rupert and the duchesses of Buckingham and Ormond. These relationships identified the princess with the Stuart dynasty and its survival from her birth.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandeducation"></a>Childhood and education</h2>Apart from a sojourn in York from 1665 to 1667, to escape the last visitation of the plague, Mary lived in the south of England until she married. The question of her education was extremely sensitive, given her father's Roman Catholicism and the fact that her mother also exhibited Catholic sympathies before her death from breast cancer in March 1671. After her mother died Mary lived at Richmond Palace, where her upbringing was entrusted to a governess, Lady Frances Villiers. To avoid any suspicions being aroused about Mary's protestantism she was educated by George Morley, bishop of Winchester, Henry Compton, bishop of London, and Edward Lake, archdeacon of Exeter, who instructed her in the principles of the Church of England, to which she became devoted. Although she learned no Latin or Greek, she did acquire French from Pierre de Laine, who in 1667 published a grammar written for the princess. According to her teacher she was &#145;absolute mistress of the French tongue&#146;  (Laine, 8). Her drawing-master was the dwarf Richard Gibson, who later went with her, together with his equally diminutive wife, to the Netherlands. Among Mary's other accomplishments were playing music on the lute and the harpsichord, and dancing, at which she was so proficient that on 2 December 1674 she appeared at court in the title role of John Crowne's ballet, <span class="italic">Calisto, or, The Chaste Nymph</span>. When Crowne published it in 1675 he dedicated it to her. Another work dedicated to her was one by Bathsua Makin on female education published in 1673, which hailed her as principal among all &#145;Ingenious and Vertuous ladies&#146;  (A. Fraser, <span class="italic">The Weaker Vessel: Women in Seventeenth Century England</span>, 1984, 321). &#145;Her Age and her Rank had denied her opportunities for much study&#146;, observed Abel Boyer in 1701, &#145;yet she had read the best Books in English, French and Dutch&#146;  (Maccubbin and Hamilton-Phillips, 4). She showed her own concern for education in 1693 by helping to establish the College of William and Mary in Virginia. Mary spent much of her leisure time gardening, doing needlework, and playing at cards. Her interest in gardens led her to advise on the design and planting of those of the houses she possessed in the Netherlands as princess of Orange and in England after she became queen. Thus she took part in the design of the garden at Honselaarsdijk and selected exotic plants for it, and suggested the aviary at Het Loo. After 1689 she discussed with Sir Christopher Wren the planning of the gardens at Hampton Court and Kensington Palace. As for her needlework, she embroidered curtains for the bedrooms in her various residences. Her addiction to card games earned her a rebuke from her tutor Dr Lake, especially when she played on Sundays.<h2>
<a name="Marriage"></a>Marriage</h2>The question of Mary's marriage partner was already being openly discussed when she was only eight years old. The deaths of her mother and her brother Edgar in 1671 made her second in the line of succession to the throne. In the absence of any legitimate children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script>, her uncle, Mary became heir to the crown after her father, James. The disposal of her hand thus became a crucial issue in British politics and European diplomacy. From the start, the claims of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29450/', "William of Orange")</script> were pressed by protestants. William himself visited England in the winter of 1670&#150;71 &#145;to pretend to the Lady Mary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, ed. A. Browning, M. K. Geiter, and W. A. Speck, 1991, 82). Although Charles II was in favour of the match, James was not, and had to be bullied into it by his brother. For a while James held off, hoping to arrange a marriage between Mary and the French dauphin. When William became stadholder in 1672 he cooled on the question, as he did not wish to identify himself with the English court and its pro-French foreign policy. With the ending of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1674, however, the negotiations for a marriage treaty were reopened. The earl of Danby, who was by then the chief minister in England, was particularly keen on this protestant match. Sir William Temple discussed it in a two-hour conversation with William in the Netherlands in which he enthused about the princess's eligibility. William visited England again in the autumn of 1677, when his marriage to Mary was arranged between himself and her father and uncle. She was then informed of the outcome on 21 October 1677, at which she &#145;wept all that afternoon and the following day&#146;  (&#145;Diary of Dr Edward Lake&#146;, 5).<br>
<br>Mary's reaction was natural in an attractive young woman of fifteen when faced with the prospect of being married to the Dutchman who was so unappealing, with his blackened teeth and hooked nose, that her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/560/', "Anne")</script> called him Caliban. Mary was taller than her husband, being all of 5 feet 11 inches while he was 5 feet 6&frac12; inches in height. She was also a passionate woman, while he was cold and regarded as unfeeling. Mary's highly emotional nature was expressed in the adolescent letters she wrote to her friend Frances Apsley, in which she described herself as the wife and her correspondent as her husband. Much of the passion she displayed can be dismissed as the excess of adolescence. The correspondents were consciously play acting, for they also signed their names Mary Clovin and Aurelia, based on characters in Philip Massinger's play <span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span>. Nevertheless, the emotion which Mary put into her letters was very strongly expressed, in that peculiar spelling of hers which was atrocious even by the lax standards of the time. Thus about 1675, when she was thirteen, she wrote:<blockquote>I love you with more zeal then any lover can, I love you with a love that ner was known by man, I have for you excese of friandship more of love than any woman can for woman and more love then ever the constanest love had for his Mrs, you are loved more then can be exprest by your ever obedient wife vere afectionate friand humbel sarvant to kis the ground where one you go to be your dog in a string, your fish in a net your bird in a cage your humbel trout. (Bathurst, 60)</blockquote>The reference to the love of a man for his mistress is one of many in the correspondence, revealing how exposure to the dissolute courts of Charles II and her father affected her early impressions of married life. She once observed to Frances that &#145;in tow or three years men are alwais wery of thier wifes and look for Mrs as sone as thay can gett them&#146;  (ibid., 51). Such youthful cynicism was a good preparation for marriage to William, who took a mistress, Mary's friend Elizabeth Villiers, even before two years had elapsed.<br>
<br>Their wedding took place at nine o'clock at night in Mary's bedchamber on 4 November 1677. Significantly the king and not her father gave Mary away. Charles &#145;was very pleasant all the time&#146;. Thus &#145;when the prince endowed her with all his worldly goods, hee willed to put all up in her pocket, for 'twas clear gains&#146;  (&#145;Diary of Dr Edward Lake&#146;, 6). As part of the settlement Mary received jewels worth &pound;40,000 and an annual allowance of &pound;10,000 plus &pound;2000 a year pin money. Sir Edmund Waller composed an epithalamium for the occasion, which included the lines<blockquote>
<div>Not Belga's fleet (his high command)<br>
</div>
<div>Which triumphs where the sun does rise<br>
</div>
<div>Nor all the force he leads by land,<br>
</div>
<div>Could guard him from her conquering eyes.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Poems of Edmund Waller</span>, ed. G. T. Drury, 2 vols., 1893, 2.80)</blockquote>The last line was especially unfortunate. Mary's eyesight was always affected by migraine-like aching, which made it at times impossible for her to read or write. At the same time William was scarcely smitten by her, at least in the early stages of their marriage which he regarded as purely diplomatic, and treated her with indifference.<br>
<br>The departure of the newly married couple for the Netherlands was delayed, initially because Mary was reluctant to leave London where her sister Anne was ill with smallpox at St James's Palace. They also had to stay until <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4894/', "Catherine of Braganza's")</script> birthday was celebrated on 15 November. The celebrations included a ball at which it was observed that William danced only once with his wife. There was court gossip about &#145;the prince's sullennesse, or clownishness, that he took no notice of the princess at the playe and balle&#146;  (&#145;Diary of Dr Edward Lake&#146;, 9). The royal party left for Margate on 19 November, Mary weeping all the morning. When the queen tried to cheer her up by relating the similar circumstances which attended her own nuptials, when she had left her native land for a strange country, Mary replied &#145;But madam you came into England; but I am going out of England&#146;  (ibid., 10). Contrary winds held them up, so they made a leisurely journey to the coast by way of Canterbury. They eventually set sail on 28 November, Mary in the <i>Katherine</i>, William in the <i>Mary</i>. The crossing was rough, and because Rotterdam was icebound they had to land at Terheyde. They went straight to Honselaarsdijk, which was to become Mary's favourite Dutch palace. On 14 December they ceremonially entered The Hague to a magnificent reception. Although the Dutch found her more appealing than the other Mary Stuart they had known, William's mother, her husband's insistence on strict protocol upset many of them. For William insisted that, while his wife could kiss the cheeks of noblemen's wives, she could not extend the same favour to those of the burghermasters.<h2>
<a name="PrincessofOrange"></a>Princess of Orange</h2>Mary miscarried in spring 1678 and again a year later. After the first miscarriage her father wrote &#145;Pray let her be more careful of herself another time&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1678</i>, 126). These miscarriages were bitter disappointments to her maternal aspirations and dynastic ambitions in the Netherlands and in Britain. She apparently never conceived again. This, together with her sister's failure to leave an heir after many pregnancies, suggests that there was a genetic problem, though whether inherited from their father, as has been suggested, or their mother is impossible to determine.<br>
<br>Although Mary scarcely found wedded bliss with the unfaithful William, she was able to transform some of the mock affection she had shown for Frances Apsley into real devotion to him. Thus she wrote to her friend on 3 March 1678:<blockquote>I supose you know the prince is gone to the Army but I am sure you can guese at the troble I am in, I am sure I coud never have thought it half so much, I thought coming out of my own contry parting with my friands and relations the greatest that ever coud as long as thay lived hapen to me but I am to be mistaken that now I find till this time I never knew sorow for what can be more cruall in the world then parting with what on loves and nott ondly comon parting but parting so as may be never to meet again to be perpetually in fear for god knows when I may see him or wethere he is nott now at this instant in a batell. (Bathurst, 88&#150;9)</blockquote>Mary's pining for her absent husband might have been inspired as much by loneliness as by love. For her life in the Netherlands appears to have been very solitary. Although she moved around her husband's palaces&#151;Dieren, Honselaarsdijk, Hoofdyke, the House in the Wood, and, when it was eventually built in the 1680s, Het Loo&#151;she was not invited to other people's residences. This could have been partly her fault, since she seems to have felt that as a princess her status was so far above the Dutch regents that she could not accept invitations. Consequently her existence was spent in card playing, needlework, and religious devotions. This pattern was only occasionally disturbed by visits, such as that which her stepmother and sister paid her in October 1678, followed by her father in February 1679, and all three in September 1679. Mary got on well with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18247/', "Mary of Modena")</script> while she was duchess of York. In their correspondence the duchess addressed the princess as &#145;the lemon&#146;, by contrast with the prince or &#145;the orange&#146;. Anne's visits were also very welcome. James's second visit was to be the last time he was in the presence of his daughter. Otherwise her routine was mundane. As the author of &#145;The character of &hellip; Queen Mary II&#146; observed of her regular practice when she returned to England, it repeated a pattern established in the Netherlands:<blockquote>What an enemy she was to idleness, even in Ladies, those who had the Honor to serve her, are living witnesses. It is well known how great a part of the Day they were employed at their needles &hellip; the Queen herself, when more important business would give her leave, working with them. And that their minds might be well employed at the same time it was her custom to order one to read to them while they were at work either Divinity or some profitable History. (<span class="italic">The Royal Diary</span>, 8)</blockquote>Her time was also employed in purchasing jewellery, perfume, porcelain, silks, and other luxury fabrics. She became quite concerned about her extravagance, struggling vainly to reduce her expenses to some kind of order. &#145;I beg ye Prince to pardon &hellip; my mistakes&#146;, she wrote in her account book in December 1687, &#145;if he happens to look over this book after my death&#146;  (Walker, 322). As an early biographer noted:<blockquote>the course of her life in her Court abroad (being indeed all little else but one unvaried scene) affords but little matter of particular memoirs worthy a peculiar relation; there happened nothing of importance or weight &hellip; till the death of &hellip; Charles the second. (Laine, 49)</blockquote>At the time of the king's death Mary and her husband were entertaining Charles's illegitimate son, the duke of Monmouth, at The Hague. Monmouth relieved the tedium of Mary's life in the Netherlands, attending magnificent balls and skating with the princess on the ice. One of the first communications from her father, now James II, which Mary received was a polite request to dismiss Monmouth from court. The duke went off to raise his fatal rebellion in England. In 1686 Gilbert Burnet took refuge from James II in the Netherlands and was kindly received by Mary and William, who invited him to their court. There he found that:<blockquote>she knew little of our affairs till I was admitted to wait on her. And I began to lay before her the state of our court, and the intrigues in it, ever since the restoration: which she received with great satisfaction, and shewed true judgment, and a good mind, in all the reflections that she made. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.134)</blockquote>Burnet claimed that, until he pointed it out, Mary was ignorant of the fact that, if she became queen, William would not be king. She expressed surprise and asked him to propose an alternative, which led him to suggest that she should give her husband the real authority and try to get it legally invested in him. Although Burnet insisted that it was his own idea, and that &#145;no person living had moved me in it&#146;, the earl of Dartmouth, when he glossed this passage, took it for granted &#145;that the prince ordered him to propose it to the princess before he would engage in the attempt upon England: and she must understand it so&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.138&#150;9).<br>
<br>Mary appears to have become more concerned about the state of affairs in England following Burnet's account of them. Thus she intervened in favour of Bishop Compton of London when her father used the commission for ecclesiastical causes to suspend him from his spiritual duties. She also gave &pound;200 to the ejected fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford. When James issued the declaration of indulgence in July 1687 she endorsed her husband's objections to it. Their views were made public in <span class="italic">Pensionary Fagel's Letter to James Stewart</span> &#145;giving an account of the Prince and Princess of Orange's thoughts concerning the repeal of the Test and Penal Laws&#146;. This open letter to Stewart, a Scottish presbyterian lawyer, dated from Amsterdam 4 November 1687, was published in Dutch and English shortly afterwards. &#145;Their highnesses have often declared&#146;, Fagel wrote, &#145;that no Christian ought to be persecuted for his conscience&#146;. They therefore offered &#145;full liberty of conscience&#146; even to Roman Catholics. But they were not prepared to agree to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span>, which were a necessary safeguard for the Church of England.<br>
<br>In view of these gestures in support of that church it is surprising that James sought to convert his daughter to Catholicism. Nevertheless, in November 1687 he wrote to Mary a letter explaining why he had converted from the Anglican to the Catholic church. She replied that:<blockquote>though she had come young out of England, yet she had not left behind her either the desire of being well informed, or the means for it. She had furnished her self with books, and had those about her who might clear any doubts to her. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.200)</blockquote>Among the latter were her chaplains. George Hooper had accompanied her to the Netherlands in 1677. He had incurred William's wrath by insisting that she worshipped exclusively according to the liturgy of the Church of England, and by recommending Anglican works such as Richard Hooker's <span class="italic">Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</span>. In 1679 he had been succeeded by Thomas Ken, whom William also disliked because he complained to the prince about the effects his infidelity were having on Mary. When Ken returned to England, where he became bishop of Bath and Wells, John Covel succeeded him from 1681 until 1685. In October 1685 Covel indiscreetly wrote to Bevil Skelton, English ambassador at The Hague, to inform him that &#145;the Princess's heart is ready to break; and yet she, every day, counterfeits the greatest joy &hellip; The Prince hath infallibly made her his absolute slave&#146;  (Singer, 2.165). When William was told about the contents of this letter he was so incensed that he gave Covel three hours' notice to leave the country. William Stanley replaced him as Mary's chaplain. Burnet also acted as her spiritual adviser, for although James had demanded his removal from her presence he still influenced her, reading the king's letter and helping her to compose a reply:<blockquote>Thus &hellip; she gave him the trouble of a long account of the grounds upon which she was persuaded of the truth of her religion; in which she was so fully satisfied, that she trusted by the grace of God that she should spend the rest of her days in it. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.202)</blockquote>James replied with a reading list of relevant books, recommending her to discuss them with an English Jesuit, Father Morgan, who was then in The Hague. Mary undertook to read the books but not to see Morgan, on the grounds that conferences with a Jesuit would not be kept secret and that news about them would do her a great deal of harm. Mary informed her sister Anne, Bishop Compton, and (by means of her chaplain Dr Stanley) William Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, of her father's attempts to convert her. These included sending her the printed account of her own mother's conversion before she died. James's efforts ended when Mary protested against the recall of the English regiments from the Netherlands. She was relieved at being spared reading more devotional literature, which had taken up a good deal of her time without in any way shaking her Anglican faith.<h2>
<a name="Therevolutionof1688"></a>The revolution of 1688</h2>Mary expressed her shock at the trial of the seven bishops, getting Dr Stanley to write to Archbishop Sancroft on behalf of herself and her husband &#145;to express their real concern for your grace and your brethren&#146;  (Strickland, 5.484). She also expressed scepticism about the birth of the prince of Wales in June 1688. Her conviction that there was &#145;quelque tromperie&#146; (&#145;some deceit&#146;) in the queen's pregnancy partly arose from her perplexity in reconciling the conviction that God would preserve the church through her, with the fact that she herself had not been blessed by providence with an heir  (Bentinck, 71, 92&#150;3). Although she ordered prayers for the prince in her chapel, she sent her sister Anne a long list of questions concerning the circumstances of Mary of Modena's pregnancy and lying-in. The first of these was &#145;whether the Queen desired at any time any of the Ladies &hellip; to feel her belly, since she thought herself quick?&#146;  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, part 1, 305). Mary became convinced that the prince was a supposititious child, and stopped the prayers for him. The thoughts that her father was capable of perpetrating such a fraud, and that humanly speaking the only way to save the church and the state in England was for her husband to dethrone him by force, afflicted her severely over the summer of 1688. She spent much of it at the newly finished palace at Het Loo, in remote Gelderland, where she was rarely disturbed by visitors. She had much time on her own, and spent it in meditation. She thanked God that her eyes were better than they had been for many years, and that she was able to read and write as well as to reflect. In September she moved to Dieren, but was still sufficiently remote in the country, and felt a spiritual tranquillity there despite the preparations that were being made by William to invade England.<br>
<br>Then in October Mary went to The Hague to be present at the prince's departure. William told her that if it so turned out that they never met again, she should remarry, though not to a papist&#151;&#145;paroles qui me perc&egrave;rent le coeur&#146; (&#145;words which pierced my heart&#146;; Bentinck, 80). She told him that she loved him only and could never love another. Besides, having been married so long and not been blessed with a child, she believed that was enough to prevent her ever thinking of what he proposed. She went with him to the river where he boarded the boat to take him to Briel. The thought of never seeing him again if the expedition miscarried was so terrible that it deprived her of her senses, and she sat immobile in her carriage for as long as she could still see him. A storm rendered the first embarkation abortive, and the task force had to return to port. This occasioned a second farewell which might have been anticlimactic after the first, but which Mary insisted &#145;m'&eacute;toit plus sensible encore que la premi&egrave;re, et lorsqu'il me quitta, c'&eacute;toit comme si l'on m'eut arrach&eacute; le coeur&#146; (&#145;was to me even more affecting than the first, and as he left me it was as if one had torn out my heart&#146;; Bentinck, 86). That was the last time she saw William before she herself followed him to England the following February.<br>
<br>Burnet saw Mary just before the expedition left, and noted that &#145;she seemed to have a great load on her spirits, but to have no scruple as to the lawfulness of the design&#146;. He urged upon her the importance of her backing William up to the hilt, since any sign of discord would be ruinous to the enterprise.<blockquote>She answered me that I need fear no such thing: if any person should attempt that, she should treat them so, as to discourage all others from venturing on it for the future. She was very solemn and serious, and prayed God earnestly to bless and direct us. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.311)</blockquote>While the expedition was under way she worshipped four times a day, and the rest of the time meditated and composed prayers. When she learned that William had successfully landed she allowed herself to relax four days a week, but refrained from playing cards. She still kept herself away from the public during the weeks of the revolution in England, coming out of her self-enforced seclusion only to entertain the Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg and his wife.<br>
<br>One of the prayers that Mary composed was for the proceedings in the Convention which was discussing the arrangements for the disposal of the crown. The proposal that there should be a regency she privately preferred. There was a strong party led by the earl of Danby which wanted her to be queen regnant. Danby wrote to urge her to insist on her hereditary right, claiming that her insistence would sway the Convention to declare her queen. Mary replied &#145;that she was the prince's wife, and never meant to be other than in subjection to him, and that she did not thank anyone for setting up for her an interest divided from that of her husband&#146;  (Strickland, 5.521). Until her views were known, however, her supporters argued strenuously against those who wished William to be king. Thus where the latter were in favour of the view that the throne was vacant, Mary's supporters contested it on the grounds that James had forfeited the crown through his Catholicism and that all other Catholics were similarly disbarred, so that the succession went automatically to the next protestant heir, who was Mary. Had Mary been present in England, notwithstanding her own preference, this view might have gained more adherents. It certainly appears that William did not encourage her to leave the Netherlands until he was assured of the crown. He got this assurance when he indicated that he had not gone over to England to be &#145;his wife's gentleman usher&#146;. On or about 3 February 1689 he held a meeting of leading politicians and told them that if Mary were to be declared queen &#145;he could not think of holding any thing by apron strings&#146;. Unless he were offered the crown &#145;he would go back to Holland and meddle no more in their affairs&#146;. This announcement &#145;helped not a little to bring the debates at Westminster to a speedy determination&#146;. What clinched them was Mary's own wish, conveyed by Burnet, to rule jointly with her husband  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.395&#150;6). The declaration of rights then declared William and Mary king and queen, though giving him the sole executive power. Mary was quite happy with this solution. &#145;My opinion&#146;, she wrote in her memoirs, &#145;has ever been that women should not meddle in government&#146;  (Doebner, 23).<h2>
<a name="Queen"></a>Queen</h2>Mary finally arrived in England on 12 February 1689. Although she expressed sadness at leaving the Netherlands where she had been so happy, her cheerful deportment when she entered Whitehall was noted and condemned by many observers as not acting with due decorum. &#145;She ran about it, looking into every closet and conveniency, and turning up the quilts of beds, just as people do at an inn&#146; wrote one admittedly hostile observer  (<span class="italic">An Account of the Conduct of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough</span>, 1742, 26). But even Burnet confessed he &#145;was one of those that censured this in my thoughts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.406). She put it down to guidance she had received from William that she should not betray any misgivings about entering a place from which her father had so recently fled. The very next day she went with William to the Banqueting House in Whitehall to assent to the declaration of rights and to accept the crown.<br>
<br>Their coronation took place in Westminster Abbey on 11 April. Bishop Compton of London officiated at it since ominously the archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, declined on conscientious grounds. Mary herself felt scruples about the &#145;pomp and vanity&#146; of the ceremony and the stress on the Anglican communion during it, which she felt arose from &#145;worldly considerations&#146;  (Doebner, 13). Throughout the ceremony the unprecedented nature of the dual monarchy was stressed. Thus where Mary or William would have received the crown kneeling on the steps of the altar if they had been mere consorts, both sat in specially made coronation chairs. The two sovereigns took a new form of coronation oath. Where James had sworn to confirm the laws and customs granted to the English people by his predecessors, they undertook to govern according to the statutes agreed on in parliament. Again, where their predecessor had agreed to uphold rightful customs, they took the oath to maintain the protestant religion. A medal struck to commemorate the coronation depicted William as Jove thundering against James II as Phaeton leaping out of a chariot at Jove's anathemas. But Jacobites claimed that the chariot represented Mary as the Roman matron Tullia, who had driven out Tullius to set up Tarquin, and that she was dethroning her father.<br>
<br>Far more devastating to Mary's peace of mind was a letter she received from her father at this time, saying that previously he<blockquote>had wholly attributed her part in the revolution to obedience to her husband; but the act of being crowned was in her power, and if she were crowned while he and the prince of Wales were living, the curse of an outraged father would light upon her, as well as of that God who has commanded duty to parents. (Strickland, 6.9)</blockquote>Jacobites kept up throughout her reign the charge that she had behaved unnaturally in replacing James. In June 1689 they exploited the queen's discomfiture at a production of Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>. The plot, involving a queen of Aragon who had usurped the throne, was grist to their mill.<blockquote>In one place, where the queen of Arragon is going to church in procession, tis said by a spectator, Very good, she usurps the throne, keeps the old king in prison and at the same time is praying for a blessing on her army &hellip; Twenty more things are said which may be wrested to what they were never designed. (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix 2, 79)</blockquote>In 1690 a Jacobite poem imagined her lying in bed &#145;at dead of night &hellip; in her own father's lodgings at Whitehall&#146;. The ghost of her mother draws back the curtain and upbraids her saying:<blockquote>
<div>Can quiet slumber ever close thine eyes?<br>
</div>
<div>Or is thy conscience sunk too low to rise?<br>
</div>
<div>From this same place was not thy aged Sire<br>
</div>
<div>Compelled by midnight-summons to retire? &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Had he been murdered, it had mercy shown<br>
</div>
<div>'Tis less to kill a king, than to dethrone.<br>
</div> (Lord, 5.298&#150;9)</blockquote>To most of her subjects, however, Mary was more acceptable than her father or for that matter her husband, who was hated as a Dutchman and despised as an alleged homosexual. William was well aware of this, and told the marquess of Halifax in June 1689 that &#145;if hee left us, the Queen would governe us better&#146;  (Foxcroft, 2.222). According to Burnet, in December he came close to bringing this about:<blockquote>He thought he could not trust the tories, and he resolved he would not trust the whigs: so he fancied the tories would be true to the queen, and confide in her, though they would not in him. He therefore resolved to go over to Holland and leave the government in the queen's hands. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.71)</blockquote>In the event wiser counsels prevailed.Soon after the coronation in Westminster Abbey, commissioners arrived from the convention which had met in Edinburgh to offer the crown of Scotland to William and Mary. The formal ceremony was held in the Banqueting House where the king and queen accepted the claim of right, the Scottish equivalent of the declaration of rights, and took the coronation oath. They thereby became king and queen of Scotland as well as England. Their claim to Ireland, however, was currently being disputed by James II, whose landing in Kinsale was reported to them on their coronation day in England. James was effective ruler of Ireland for over a year.<br>
<br>William's departure for Ireland in June 1690 raised the problem of the arrangements to be made for the governing of the country in his absence. At first he did not want to leave Mary in charge at all, preferring to appoint a council which would simply report to her but be answerable to himself. Thus he told Halifax that &#145;there must be a Councell to governe in his absence, and that the Queen was not to meddle&#146;  (Foxcroft, 2.246). However, he was persuaded that it was most convenient to pass an act of parliament vesting the administration in Mary. The <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> stated that, notwithstanding the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span>:<blockquote>whensoever and so often as it shall happen that his Majesty shall be absent out of this realm of England it shall and may be lawful for the Queen's Majesty to exercise and administer the regal power and government of the kingdom. (<span class="italic">Statutes of the Realm</span>, 11 vols., 1810&#150;28, 6.170)</blockquote>Some members of parliament objected to the arrangement. As one put it &#145;if the king should die in this expedition and the queen be regent, what if, out of duty to her father, if he land she should not oppose him?&#146; &#145;The question is&#146;, riposted another, &#145;whether you will trust the government in the queen's hands or not at all?&#146; Such arguments were set aside when it became clear that &#145;the king is resolved to trust the queen&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 6, 1690, 611&#150;18).<br>
<br>Mary was anxious that she &#145;should not make a foolish figure in the world&#146;  (Doebner, 23) when she took on her new responsibilities. For much of 1689 after the coronation she had devoted herself to the same kind of interests she had cultivated in the Netherlands. Thus she had brought her collection of Chinese porcelain to Hampton Court where the royal pair spent the summer. In the autumn they had moved nearer to London to Holland House, and just before Christmas acquired Kensington Palace. Mary herself remarked on the difference between the tranquillity she had enjoyed in the Netherlands and the bustle which surrounded her in England: &#145;et ce qui m'afflige&#146; she wrote to Mademoiselle la Baronne de Wassenaer d'Obdam on 10 August 1689, &#145;c'est le peu d'apparence que je voie d'estre encore si heureuse&#146; (&#145;what afflicts me is the small prospect I see of ever being so happy again&#146;; Bentinck, 119).<br>
<br>The major disturbance to Mary's domestic peace had been a disagreement with her sister over Anne's intrigues with members of parliament to get a financial settlement for herself. This was the first round in a quarrel which was to estrange Mary from Anne completely. Mary thought that her sister should be content to depend on herself and her husband for her finances. But Anne, who had agreed to set aside her hereditary claim to the throne in William's favour, thought that an adequate parliamentary grant was a fair compensation, especially since she was in financial difficulties. The matter came to a head in the House of Commons in December, when Anne's supporters voted her an annual allowance of &pound;50,000, much to Mary's chagrin. On 3 March 1690 she observed privately that there was a Jacobite party and a republican party in England, &#145;et que j'ay raison de craindre que ma soeur en forme une troisieme&#146; (&#145;and that I have reason to fear that my sister is forming a third&#146;; Bentinck, 95). Apart from this foray into public affairs, however, Mary had been very much left at leisure to pursue her hobbies of gardening and needlework. As Burnet observed, &#145;she seemed to employ her time and thoughts in any thing rather than matters of state&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.87). Now she had to take over the government of the country.<h2>
<a name="Queenregnant1690"></a>Queen regnant, 1690</h2>Mary was not left alone to govern, for although the <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> made no mention of a council, William appointed one consisting of nine of the principal ministers of state. He clearly gave her his opinion of them, for in July she wrote to him &#145;I thought you had given me wrong characters of men, but now I see they answer my expectation of being as little of a mind as a body&#146;  (Dalrymple, 2/2, 143). Their failure to arrive at a consensus was due to the fact that five were tories while four were whigs. Mary was not impressed by any of the nine, her own comments on each of them being negative. Of Thomas Osborne, marquess of Carmarthen, whom William had particularly recommended to her, she wrote that he was &#145;of a temper I can never like&#146;. The earl of Devonshire she found &#145;weak and obstinate&#146;, the earl of Dorset was too lazy, the earls of Monmouth and Pembroke were &#145;mad&#146;, the earls of Marlborough and Nottingham were untrustworthy, while Sir John Lowther was &#145;a very honest but weak man&#146;. The ninth, Edward Russell, though he &#145;was recommended to me for sincerity, yet he had his faults&#146;  (Doebner, 29&#150;30).<br>
<br>Mary's inexperience in affairs of state showed in her dealings with the council, who were not overimpressed by her abilities. She confessed to William that &#145;as I do not know when I ought to speak and when not, I am as silent as can be&#146;. &#145;Every one sees how little I know of business and therefore will be apt to do as much as they can&#146; she further informed him. &#145;I find they meet often at the Secretary's [Nottingham's] office, and do not take much pains to give me an account&#146;  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, part 2, 119, 121). She soon demonstrated that they had underestimated her. Carmarthen, who held the post of president of the council, felt he should have the prevailing influence. One Jacobite libel asserted that &#145;she's governed in Council by the marquis [of] Carmarthen&#146;  (Lord, 5.193). In fact she was quite able to divide and rule the nine. To offset the influence of Carmarthen, a tory, she made a point of cultivating the whig Edward Russell, telling him &#145;that I desired to see him sometime, for being a stranger to business I was afraid of being too much led or persuaded by one party&#146;. When the whigs tried to take advantage of her by offering &pound;200,000 if she dissolved parliament she told Monmouth, who made the offer, that she would have to consult the king about it  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, part 2, 122, 141). Mary's deference to William in fact resolved a problem which had agitated debates on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> as to the division of the executive power between them. There had been some concern about the consequences of their not seeing eye to eye. In the event this never arose, because Mary was anxious to prevent it. &#145;That which makes me in pain&#146;, she wrote to William, &#145;is for fear what is done may not please you. I am sure it is my chief desire &hellip; as much as may be to act according to your mind&#146;  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, part 2, 129). She stuck by the resolution adopted at the first meeting of the nine that &#145;all business that will admit delay must be sent to the king that his pleasure may be known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 2.378).<br>
<br>A crisis arose during Mary's first experience of government, however, which demanded decisions which could not be referred to the king. The defeat inflicted on the English fleet by the French at Beachy Head in June 1690 called for urgent action by the regents. Mary rose to the occasion. &#145;Heaven seems to have sent us one of the most threatening junctures that England ever saw&#146;, a newspaper claimed, &#145;merely to set off with the greater lustre the wisdom magnanimity and justice of a princess who has made good some people's fears and other's hopes in deserving the character of another Queen Elizabeth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Reformatus, or, The New Observator</span>, 1 Aug 1690). Burnet, who saw her every week that summer, observed that she &#145;shewed an extraordinary firmness &hellip; her behaviour was in all respects heroical&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.98). She also kept a cool head, as the treatment of the earl of Ailesbury, a suspected Jacobite, reveals. In July she issued an order for the arrest of several Jacobites, including Ailesbury. He got his wife to communicate to the queen how mortified he was that, as a suspect on bail, he could not pay his duty to her. He recalled:<blockquote>The Queen's answer was in these very words: &#145;Tell my Lady of Ailesbury that I love to do good to all persons as far as I can, but more especially to her husband and his family, whom I knew so well in my youngest years &hellip; and therefore, for his sake, I will break through the common forms and direct him to come at four tomorrow afternoon.&#146;</blockquote>Ailesbury accordingly waited on &#145;that good and incomparable Queen&#146; and even played cards with her, to the astonishment of her companions  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.264&#150;5).<br>
<br>The loss of the battle of Beachy Head was attributed to the misconduct of the earl of Torrington, the English admiral. Mary determined to dispense with his services and to imprison him in the Tower to await the outcome of a judicial inquiry into his actions. Fortunately the situation was saved by William's victory at the battle of the Boyne. Mary was relieved to learn that her husband had won and that her father had managed to escape unscathed. Her relief that both had been spared was expressed in the letter she wrote to the electress of Hanover. &#145;La conservation et la victoire d'un mary d'un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, et la pr&eacute;servation de la personne d'un p&egrave;re de l'autre &hellip; &eacute;toit plus que je n'osois esp&eacute;rer&#146; (&#145;the conservation and the victory of a husband on one side, and the preservation of a father on the other &hellip; was more than I dared to hope&#146;; Bentinck, 107).<br>
<br>The problem of replacing Torrington Mary had to resolve by herself. She had initially referred the decision to William, but the advice he gave, that Edward Russell and Richard Haddock should replace the admiral, proved abortive, for Russell declined the appointment. Mary then proposed that Haddock should serve with Sir John Ashby, a proposal endorsed by the nine. When the commissioners of the Admiralty were brought in to be informed of this, however, one of them, Sir Thomas Lee, objected that they should have been consulted earlier and invited to recommend a replacement. To this Mary replied &#145;then the king &hellip; could not make an admiral which the admiralty did not like?&#146; Lee answered &#145;no, no more he can't&#146;  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, part 2, 147). Although in the end she got her own way, backed up by the nine, Mary discovered how much such matters were accomplished &#145;by partiality and faction&#146;. As she confessed to the electress of Hanover in a letter of 14 August &#145;les animosit&eacute;s personelles, que les gens ont l'un contre l'autre, sont bien d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ables, et les partis diff&eacute;rents sont trop difficiles &agrave; m&eacute;nager pour moi&#146; (&#145;the personal animosities that men have for one another are disagreeable enough, and the different parties are too difficult for me to manage&#146;; Bentinck, 107). &#145;When I &hellip; see what folk do here&#146;, she wrote to William, &#145;it grieves me too much, for Holland has really spoiled me in being kind to me&#146;  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, part 2, 3). Mary's first real experience as queen had been bruising. She was relieved when her husband returned in September and expressed himself &#145;very much pleased with her behaviour&#146;  (Doebner, 34).<h2>
<a name="Queenregnant16911694"></a>Queen regnant, 1691&#150;1694</h2>When William left England again in January 1691, this time for the Netherlands, his previous year's absence had established a routine for the running of the country. While he was on the continent, which apart from a brief return in mid-April lasted until October, the regency council dealt with routine business while Mary coped with any crises. There was concern about the discovery of a Jacobite plot involving Lord Preston, but this was dealt with by the king when he returned briefly to England. Mary's involvement in the process was limited to an exchange with Preston's daughter, whom she found admiring a portrait of James II at Kensington and asked her why she did so. The young girl answered &#145;I am reflecting how hard it is that my father should be put to death for loving your father&#146;  (Dalrymple, 1.466&#150;7). The only alarm the queen faced was a disastrous fire at Whitehall, which destroyed much of the palace, and forced her to escape in her nightdress, just before the king returned in April. Otherwise Mary was able to pass her time in public playing cards and arranging a ball for her sister's birthday, and in private meditating that God would bring success to their undertakings. These meditations were not just for the blessing of providence in general, but for particular enterprises. Thus she asked God to:<blockquote>Regarde avec un oeil de compassion ceux qui sont en Irlande, et, si c'est ta volont&eacute;, mets fin &agrave; cette malheureuse guerre. B&eacute;nis pour cette fin les efforts de notre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, Mr de Ginkle, et les autres qui sont employ&eacute; &agrave; cet oeuvre.(Regard with a compassionate eye those who are in Ireland, and, if it is Thy will, put an end to this unhappy war. Bless for this end the efforts of our general, Mr van Ginkel, and the others who are employed in this work. Bentinck, 101)</blockquote>&#145;The only thing of business&#146; she dealt with, according to her memoirs, &#145;was the filling the Bishoprics&#146;  (Doebner, 37). The bishoprics which had to be filled were those occupied by the nonjurors, who had been deprived of their sees for not swearing oaths of allegiance to William and Mary. Burnet maintained that &#145;the king left the matters of the church wholly in the queen's hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.211). But that was not always the case. &#145;The Queen shall give no bishoprics&#146;, he informed Lord Halifax on the eve of his first departure in 1690  (Foxcroft, 2.251). When Canterbury became vacant in 1694 on Tillotson's death, he translated Thomas Tenison to it, whereas she would have preferred Edward Stillingfleet  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.244). The sensitive business of depriving Archbishop Sancroft and other nonjuring bishops, however, he did leave to his wife. She handled it admirably, choosing John Tillotson as Sancroft's replacement at Canterbury. Tillotson was just the man to lead the Church of England during the troubled years following the revolution of 1688. &#145;Had it been put to a poll&#146;, William Sherlock claimed, &#145;there had been vast odds on his side that he would have been voted into the see of Canterbury&#146;  (Sherlock, 17). Mary was even prepared to risk offending her husband by promoting George Hooper to the deanery of Canterbury, for William had expressed his dislike of the new dean. Hooper had apparently said that &#145;if her husband retained his throne it would be by her skill and talents for governing&#146;  (Strickland, 6.62).<br>
<br>Relations with Anne continued to deteriorate over the summer of 1691. This time they involved perceived slights to Anne's husband, George, prince of Denmark. George had already felt insulted by the king, whom he had accompanied to Ireland the previous year. William virtually took no notice of his brother-in-law, ignoring his part in the battle of the Boyne. To the insult offered to George's military prowess the king added another relating to his naval expertise. George told William that he wished to join the navy as a volunteer, an ambition the king did nothing to curb before his own departure in January 1691. He gave orders to Mary, however, that the prince was not to be allowed to serve, and she had the invidious task in May of sending Lord Nottingham to George with orders forbidding him to join a ship to which he had already consigned his baggage, which had to be removed. The upshot was, according to a contemporary report, that &#145;the two sisters quarreled terribly&#146;  (Gregg, 80).<br>
<br>They were to quarrel even more fiercely when William returned from the campaign in October 1691 complaining about the conduct of the earl of Marlborough, Anne's favourite. The king accused Marlborough of corresponding with the exiled James II and of conniving with his wife to alienate Anne from her sister and himself. Certainly John and Sarah Churchill, the earl and countess of Marlborough, were Anne's most intimate confidants in her dispute with William and Mary. Their intrigues, which did indeed include correspondence with James, led William to cashier the earl from all his offices and to ban him from court in January 1692. Although the ban undoubtedly extended to Marlborough's wife, Anne provocatively took Sarah to court at Kensington Palace on 4 February. Mary restrained herself from remonstrating with her sister at the time, on the grounds of the princess's pregnancy. But she wrote to her the very next morning to complain that she had &#145;all the reason imaginable to look upon your bringing her as the strangest thing that ever was done&#146;  (Strickland, 5.344&#150;6). She concluded by virtually ordering Anne to dispense with Sarah's services. When Anne refused Mary evicted her from her apartment at the Cockpit. Before quitting the Cockpit, Anne sought an interview with her sister who, according to Sarah, &#145;was as insensible as a Statue&#146;  (Gregg, 88). Anne and Prince George moved to Syon House. In April Mary sent the earl of Rochester to Anne to demand the immediate dismissal of Sarah, upon which the princess and her husband could be reinstated in their former residence. Anne gave the spirited reply that she was quite content with her new abode, so much so &#145;that should the Monsters grow good natured and endulge her in everything she could desire &hellip; she would be hardly persuaded to leave her retirement&#146;  (Gregg, 90). William had become a monster, &#145;Caliban&#146;, the &#145;Dutch abortion&#146;, to the princess before this. Now Mary was identified with him in Anne's eyes. Mary attempted a reconciliation with her sister by visiting her after she had given birth to a stillborn child on 17 April. But her insistence on the dismissal of Sarah made the attempt futile. It was the last time that the sisters met. Mary made the breach permanent by issuing an order that nobody could appear at court who had visited Anne. She even forbade the mayor of Bath to receive the princess, though when she did so, according to the earl of Nottingham, she &#145;could not refrain from tears, and said &#147;Thus it becomes a Queen to act, but I cannot forget she is my sister&#148;&#146;  (Gregg, 96).<br>
<br>Mary was again queen regnant under the terms of the <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> when William was out of the country from 5 March to 18 October 1692. She appears to have been more reluctant than before to take decisions without reference to William. Perhaps he had criticized her for some of those she had taken the previous year, possibly concerning the replacing of the nonjurors. Or it could be that she was reprimanded for her initial flippancy when she was asked to round up the usual Jacobite suspects and presented with a list headed by Ailesbury. According to him she replied that he had been arrested in 1690 for nothing, and ordered his name to be eliminated. Nottingham then replied that they had orders from the king, at which &#145;with warmth&#146; Mary demanded to see his orders:<blockquote>On which the Secretary replied &#145;Madam we have received orders to clap up a certain number.&#146; On which she laughed, and with life and judgement added, &#145;I thought persons were to be taken up for crimes and not to make up numbers as they empanel jurymen.&#146; So other names of persons were presented to her, and finding at the top, Robert of Scarsdale, &#145;Stop there, my Lord. Since you will have your number, put in that Lord's name insted of my Lord Ailesbury's, and if titles please you, there is an Earl for an Earl. What is sauce for one is sauce for another.&#146; (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.298)</blockquote>If this story reached William he might not have seen the joke and instructed his wife to take his orders more seriously. At all events the earl of Nottingham noted of one decision that her advisers thought it &#145;very reasonable for the Queen to grant &hellip; but her Majesty would take no resolution without the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 4.40). Mary was later criticized in parliament for referring matters to William, one member expressing the wish that &#145;she had dispatched more herself without sending abroad for orders&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Parliamentary Diary of Narcissus Luttrell</span>, ed. H. Horwitz, 1972, 251).<br>
<br>There was unease among officers of the armed forces at the disgrace of Marlborough, who spent some weeks in the Tower this year, that it was the prelude to a general purge. So seriously was this threat taken that Mary felt obliged to reassure naval officers:<blockquote>that she reposes an entire confidence in them all, and will never think that any brave English seaman will betray her or his country to the insolent tyranny of the French, and as it is their duty and their glory to defend the government, it shall be her part to reward their service. (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 4.141&#150;2)</blockquote>This reassurance inspired sixty-four naval officers to sign an address of loyalty, pledging to venture their lives in defence of her rights and the liberty and religion of England. The navy went on to win the battle of La Hogue, and with it the command of the sea. The queen was as good as her word and rewarded the seamen with a substantial sum of money, and pledged herself to establish a hospital at Greenwich for those who were disabled. Mary might have left more to William than she needed to have done in 1692, for whatever reason; but as this episode reveals she could still rise to the occasion when it was required. Both houses of parliament recognized this when they thanked her for her administration of the government during William's absence. The Lords congratulated her on her resolute conduct &#145;by which the danger of an invasion was prevented and a glorious victory obtained at sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 15.115). The Commons noted that while Europe was engulfed in war:<blockquote>we, your Majesty's subjects under your auspicious reign, enjoyed the blessings of peace at home, and &hellip; saw your Majesty's fleet return with so complete and glorious a victory as is not to be equalled in any former age and can never be forgotten by Posterity. (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 10.698)</blockquote>Although she might have treated the Jacobites leniently, Mary's feelings for her father hardened during the course of this year. When James issued a declaration on the eve of La Hogue offering vague concessions to English protestants, Mary allowed it to be published in England in order to discredit him. And when she discovered that he was involved in a plot to assassinate her husband it removed the last vestiges of respect for the former king.<br>
<br>Mary noted in her memoirs that her administration during William's absence from 24 March to 29 October 1693 &#145;was all along unfortunate, and whereas other years the King had almost ever approved all was done, this year he disapproved almost every thing&#146;  (Doebner, 59). The friction between them was political. Mary's attachment to the tories became stronger than ever, while William began to show a preference for the whigs. In April the queen was godmother at the baptism of the earl of Nottingham's fourteenth child. Yet the previous month, before setting out for the Netherlands, the king had appointed the whigs John Trenchard and John Somers to the second secretaryship of state and the lord keepership. The whigs in the cabinet criticized Nottingham's alleged failure to protect a merchant fleet bound for the Levant, which was attacked by the French. These criticisms distressed Mary, who praised Nottingham as &#145;the man I found the most constant in serving the king his own way, and who was the man who really toock the most and greatest pains to do so&#146;  (Doebner, 59). Yet when William returned he dismissed Nottingham from the senior secretaryship and offered it to the whig duke of Shrewsbury. &#145;When I begin to reflect on this year&#146;, Mary noted at the end of 1693, &#145;I am almost frighted and dare hardly go on; for t'is the year I have met with more troubles as to publick matters than any other&#146;  (ibid., 58).<br>
<br>The following April Mary complained of infirmities which she attributed to advancing years, or to &#145;le chagrin et les inqui&eacute;tudes qu'on a si r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement tous les est&eacute;s&#146; (&#145;the grief and anxieties that I have so regularly every summer&#146;; Bentinck, 146). It seems that Mary played less of a role as regent than usual while William was absent from 6 May to 9 November. She continued to preside at meetings of the privy council, which met almost twice a week. But she rarely attended the cabinet, which took the major decision to have the fleet winter in the Mediterranean without her in consultation with the king. She was thus less involved in the government of the country in 1694 than she had been in 1690. During that period, however, William had been abroad for over two and a half years, rather more than half the time. Mary had made a crucial contribution to the development of a system of governing the country during the regular absences of the king.<h2>
<a name="Maryslegacy"></a>Mary's legacy</h2>Mary reconciled the bulk of the tories to the revolution of 1688. Had William been sole ruler from the start he would have been king mainly of the whigs. Jacobitism, by no means a negligible force, would have become even more formidable. It was no coincidence that the most serious Jacobite plots against the regime took place after the queen's death. By that time, however, thanks to her most tories remained loyal to William. They accepted her as next in line to the throne after her father, conveniently dismissing her half-brother as a supposititious child. As Aphra Behn put it on Mary's arrival in England in 1689:<blockquote>
<div>The murmuring world till now divided lay,<br>
</div>
<div>Vainly debating whom they shou'd Obey<br>
</div>
<div>Till you great Cesar's Off-spring blest our Isle<br>
</div>
<div>The differing Multitudes to Reconcile.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Works of Aphra Behn</span>, ed. J. Todd, 7 vols., 1992&#150;6, 1.307)</blockquote>Mary reconciled herself to the revolution by attributing it to providence. God had weighed her father in the balance and found him wanting. She and her husband were therefore the instruments of divine judgment. As Burnet recorded, she was fully convinced &#145;that God had conducted her by an immediate hand and that she was raised up to preserve that Religion which was then everywhere in its last Agonies&#146;  (Burnet, <span class="italic">Essay</span>, 95). Mary's belief in providence was absolute. &#145;I cannot tell, if it should be his will to suffer you to come to harm for our sins&#146;, she wrote privately to William in Ireland, &#145;for though God is able, yet many times he punishes the sins of a nation as it seems good in his sight&#146;  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, part 2, 130). The outcome of the battle of the Boyne was a clear sign that providence still blessed their cause. But if the English mocked it by continuing in their sinful ways, providence would condemn it.<br>
<br>What was needed to ensure the permanence of the revolution of 1688 was a moral revolution. To inspire this Mary set an example of piety and devotion. Services in royal chapels became more frequent and more public. She surrounded herself with clergymen who had been foremost in the campaign against popery and vice under her father and her uncle. She publicized their sermons by having many which were preached before her printed. Thus where under Charles II a mere three a year had appeared by command of the king, an annual average of seventeen sermons were published by Mary's command. After her death the average commissioned by the court dropped to four a year. Preaching a sermon on the occasion of her demise Thomas Manningham noted that:<blockquote>Tis to the Queen that we owe many of those Pious Treatises which have been lately Publish'd amongst us; And that multitude of plain, useful and Practical Sermons, which she approv'd of, and caused to be printed, are Her Gift to the Publick. (Claydon, 98)</blockquote>Her efforts to promote piety included schemes to eliminate pluralism and non-residence in the Church of England by putting pressure on clergymen guilty of these practices &#145;when not enforced by real necessity&#146; to abandon those livings where they were not resident. Just before her death she admitted that &#145;she had no great hope of mending matters, yet she was resolved to go on&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Royal Diary</span>, 5).<br>
<br>Besides setting an example at court, Mary also supported the societies for reformation of manners in their efforts to get the country to mend its ways in order to avert God's wrath. In July 1691 she issued a proclamation to the justices of the peace for Middlesex for the suppressing of profaneness and debauchery. The following year &#145;the queen, in the king's absence, gave orders to execute the laws against drunkeness, swearing and the profanation of the Lord's day; and sent directions over England to all magistrates to do their duty in executing them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.181&#150;2). Some of the measures undertaken by the queen to prevent the profanation of Sunday provoked ridicule. Lord Dartmouth noted against this passage in Burnet's <span class="italic">History of my Own Time</span>:<blockquote>There came forth at this time several puritanical regulations for observing the sabbath in London, savouring so much of John Knox's doctrine and discipline, that Burnet was thought to have been the chief contriver. One was that hackney coaches should not drive upon that day; by another, constables were ordered to take away pies and puddings from anybody they met carrying of them in the streets; with a multitude of other impertinences so ridiculous in themselves, and troublesome to all sorts of people, that they were soon dropt, after they had been sufficiently laughed at. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.182)</blockquote>Mary even tried by fiat to suppress vice in the army and navy, though without much success. Notwithstanding that some of them were excessive, the result of all Mary's endeavours, according to the dissenters who presented William with an address of condolence on her death, was &#145;that the Court, that is usually the centre of vanity and voluptuousness became virtuous by the impression of her example&#146;  (Bates, 25).<br>
<br>Mary died on 28 December 1694. She had not been well since 24 November, when she was present at a service conducted by Archbishop Tillotson at which he had collapsed with a stroke from which he never recovered, dying a few days later. The first signs of Mary's fatal illness appeared on 19 December. She shook these off initially, so that it was hoped she only suffered from measles. But by the end of Christmas day it became clear that she was suffering from the most virulent smallpox. Archbishop Tenison felt duty bound to inform her that she was dying, for which she thanked him, since &#145;she had nothing then to do, but to look up to God and submit to his will&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 5.247). Her death occurred at Kensington Palace about one o'clock on the morning of the 28th.<br>
<br>Jacobites insisted that Mary's death was a judgment of God upon her. One pamphleteer pointed out that she died in the same month that her father had endured an unnatural rebellion, while she was cut off in her prime&#151;she was only thirty-two&#151;according to the punishment threatened to breakers of the fifth commandment. A Jacobite &#145;Epitaph&#146; appeared:<blockquote>
<div>Here ends, notwithstanding her specious pretences,<br>
</div>
<div>The undutiful child of the kindest of princes.<br>
</div>
<div>Well here let her lie, for by this time she knows,<br>
</div>
<div>What it is such a father and king to depose.<br>
</div> (Strickland, 6.130)</blockquote>Mary's admirers turned the tables on her detractors, claiming that her death was a judgment on the nation for its sins. &#145;We have just cause to fear our sins have hastened her death&#146; preached the duke of Newcastle's chaplain:<blockquote>God in his goodness sent us such a princess as was both a patroness and an example of goodness: a glass by which this crooked age might have rectified itself; and seeing he has waited divers years, and found no amendment, what was it but just to take the mirror from us? What should they do with a light who will not walk by it? (Pead, 19)</blockquote>&#145;Natural causes had their share in this evil&#146;, conceded Archbishop Tenison, &#145;but it was the immorality, the sin of the nation which hastened it as a judgment&#146;  (Tenison, 26).<br>
<br>Mary's body was embalmed the day she died, a necessary precaution in view of the putrescent effects of smallpox. It took from 28 December 1694 to 21 February 1695 to prepare for her lying-in-state, which took place from noon until five o'clock every day until 5 March. Although Mary herself had privately expressed the wish for a simple funeral, she was then buried with elaborate ceremony in Westminster Abbey. Sir Christopher Wren supervised the construction of a railed walk from the Banqueting House to the abbey, along which the funeral procession made its way in a blinding snowstorm. For the first time in English history the coffin of a monarch was accompanied by members of both houses of parliament. Although normally they were dissolved by the death of a king or queen regnant, William's surviving her as sole monarch created a unique situation. Consequently Mary's funeral procession was the largest ever held for an English monarch. The mourners entered the abbey to the solemn strains of Purcell's specially composed funeral anthem. The casket was laid under a catafalque designed by Wren, while the archbishop of Canterbury preached a sermon, and then it was lowered into the tomb. A wax effigy of the dead queen was placed on display in the abbey, so that Mary's image would be perpetuated beyond the grave. She had not wanted her funeral to be expensive, but the total cost came to about &pound;100,000.<br>
<br>Her reputation was fiercely disputed between Jacobites and Williamites. A Jacobite epitaph summed up the view of James's supporters:<blockquote>
<div>Between vice and virtue she parted her life,<br>
</div>
<div>She was too bad a daughter and too good a wife.<br>
</div> (Strickland, 6.130)</blockquote>On the other hand John Somers, the whig leader, stated in parliament &#145;I believe her the best woman in the world&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 5.631). Mary generated these contrary responses in her subjects. The public image she projected could foster both. Her behaviour on taking over Whitehall Palace in 1689 certainly seemed unfeeling in a daughter, while her toleration of William's infidelity did seem to be beyond the call of duty, even given the lax court morals of the age. At the same time her piety struck many observers as being sincere. &#145;If any person came to visit her in the morning before she pour'd forth her prayers&#146;, observed one admirer, &#145;she sent them back with this expression <i>That she was first to serve the King of Kings</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Royal Diary</span>, 2). Her private memoirs, letters, and meditations, however, leave little doubt that the eulogists were nearer the truth than the detractors. The survival of these papers, some preserved in French, gives a rare insight into her private thoughts. They document a simple piety and devotion to the Church of England. Of course she was no saint, as she readily admitted to herself. Her treatment of her sister Anne could be called an unnecessary vendetta. Yet she clearly felt affection for her father until he forfeited it by countenancing the death of her husband. And, although their marriage got off to a rocky start, William and Mary did come to respect and even perhaps to love each other with the passage of the years. Certainly he was distraught at the onset of her fatal illness, risking infection from smallpox himself by insisting on ministering to her, and her death devastated him.<br>
<br>Mary was a passionate and intelligent woman, which made her sensitive to her position. She was very aware of the role which, in her view, she had been called upon by providence to play. And she played it well. Her actions at the time of the revolution of 1688 reconciled many Anglicans, who were uneasy about replacing James with William, to the new regime. She did not wish to rule as well as to reign, being more than content to let her husband exercise the executive authority. But, when called upon in his frequent absences to administer affairs, she showed that she was quite able to do so, and to stand up to the cynical and experienced politicians with whom she had to work.<br>
<br>Perhaps above all Mary was prepared for death. She read Charles Drelincourt's <span class="italic">Art of Dying Well</span> (its published title was <span class="italic">The Christian's Defence Against the Fears of Death</span>) seven times over. She often expressed indifference to dying, only wishing that she would die before William. She got her wish. And after the delirium in the first onset of her final illness, in which she raved alarmingly, she became perfectly composed and conscious of her fate. Mary had learned Drelincourt's lesson and died an exemplary death.<br>
