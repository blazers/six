<span class="headword">Onn bin Jaafar, Dato Sir</span>  (1895&#150;1962), <span class="occ">administrator and politician in Malaya</span>, was born in Johor Bahru, the son of Dato Jaafar bin Haji Muhammad and his Circassian wife. His father and several other members of his family served as <i>mentri besar</i> (chief minister) of Johor, which was then a British protected state. Treated as an adopted son by Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, Onn was sent with the royal princes to Aldeburgh Lodge School in Suffolk. After his return he completed his education at Malay College, Kuala Kangsar, which groomed aristocrats for administration. He became a clerk in the Johor secretariat and also served in the Johor Volunteer Force but, falling out with Sultan Ibrahim, he left government employment. He married his third wife, Halimah binte Hussein, in May 1921; their eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94675/', "Tun Hussein Onn")</script> (prime minister of Malaysia, 1976&#150;81) was born in 1922.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Onn drifted from job to job and dabbled in journalism. In the English-language press he criticized Ibrahim's authoritarianism and British colonialism. As editor of three Malay-language newspapers (<span class="italic">Warta Malaya</span> in 1930&#150;33, <span class="italic">Lembaga Malaya</span> in 1934&#150;6, and <span class="italic">Lembaga</span> in 1935&#150;6), he was drawn into the Malay campaign for a larger share in government. Reconciled with Sultan Ibrahim, he joined the Johor state council in 1936, was appointed private secretary to the crown prince in 1938, and represented Johor at the San Francisco Exhibition in 1938&#150;9. In December 1940 he attended the congress of Malay associations held in Kuala Lumpur, but gave little indication of his future as a nationalist leader.<br>
<br>When Japan invaded Johor in December 1941 Onn was in charge of information and publicity, and he remained in state administration during the occupation. He worked as food controller and later as district officer of Batu Pahat, where he won renown for pacifying communal conflict. In the confusion surrounding Emperor Hirohito's surrender, the Japanese invited Onn and other Malay leaders to Singapore in an abortive attempt to establish a national government, but the British returned unopposed. They brought with them a radical plan for the rehabilitation of the country and the creation of a multiracial nation. The principal features of their Malayan Union scheme were strong central government and a common citizenship for all (Chinese and Indians as well as Malays) who regarded Malaya as home. The Malays protested against the loss of their birthright and attacked the manner in which the British had foisted new treaties on their rulers. Political associations, which had lain dormant for three and a half years, revived and new ones were formed, such as Pergerakan Melayu Semenanjong Johor, launched by Onn.<br>
<br>From his base in Johor, where he served as chief minister from 1946 to 1950, Onn (who had been given the title dato by the sultan of Johor, and was thereafter known as Dato Onn) seized the leadership of a mass, peninsula-wide yet inchoate nationalist movement. In March 1946 he convened in Kuala Lumpur a pan-Malayan Malay congress which, two months later, became the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), with Onn as its president. He organized a non-co-operation campaign and persuaded the Malay rulers to boycott the installation of Sir Edward Gent as governor of the Malayan Union. Gent and Malcolm MacDonald (the regional governor-general) soon recognized the need to regain Malay confidence and on 1 February 1948, after months of negotiations, the Malayan Union was replaced by the Federation of Malaya. The federation secured strong central government for the British and salvaged for non-Malays a common, though weaker, citizenship scheme. On the other hand, the sovereignty of the Malay rulers was restored, and Malay political pre-eminence was assured.<br>
<br>The defeat of the Malayan Union was the high point in Onn's career. While he had been a charismatic and strong-willed campaigner, his mercurial temperament was less suited to managing the Malay differences that resurfaced once the Malayan Union crisis ended. He now concentrated on his longer-term objective of preparing Malays for self-government, but refrained from demanding early independence, particularly after the outbreak of the communist insurgency in 1948. Arguing that the predominantly rural Malays were not ready to hold their own against Malaya's Chinese, he continued to press the British for guarantees of Malay rights and for assistance in economic and social development. The British treated him as a national statesman in the making; in 1950 Sir Henry Gurney, high commissioner from 1948 to 1951, appointed Onn the member for home affairs in a quasi-ministerial government, and chairman of the rural and industrial development authority. At the same time, because he realized that the British would not transfer power to the Malays alone, Onn worked to improve inter-ethnic relations through the communities liaison committee (from late 1948 to 1951). As he pursued his ambitious though somewhat erratic course, however, he fell foul of the sultans and clashed with members of his own party. His espousal of non-communalism obliged him to resign as president of UMNO in August 1951 and a few weeks later he was expelled from the party altogether, on account of joining non-Malays in the new Independence of Malaya Party (IMP).<br>
<br>The IMP fell into decline as soon as it was trounced in the Kuala Lumpur municipal elections in February 1952. Left with neither a Malay power-base nor the trust of non-Malays, Onn was gradually eclipsed by Tunku Abdul Rahman, his successor as UMNO president. While Onn remained on the federal legislative and executive councils and was knighted KBE in the coronation honours list of 1953, the Tunku subtly negotiated an inter-communal alliance with the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress. Combining with Malay chief ministers in a national conference, Onn tried to slow down the alliance's advance towards independence. In February 1954 he reformed the IMP as Party Negara, but this soon lost its non-communal appeal without attracting significant Malay support. It failed to win a seat in the federal elections of 1955, while Onn himself was its single successful candidate in 1959, being returned by a constituency in Trengganu.<br>
<br>Onn died in Johor Bahru on 19 January 1962 and was buried beside his father and elder brother. Many of his followers left politics after Malayan independence in 1957 and Party Negara did not long survive his death. Nevertheless, Onn would be remembered as the champion of Malays in the Malayan Union crisis and the father of UMNO.<br>
