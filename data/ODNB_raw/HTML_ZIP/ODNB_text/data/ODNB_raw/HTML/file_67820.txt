<span class="headword">Thesiger,  Ernest Frederic Graham</span>  (1879&#150;1961), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London on 15 January 1879, third of the four children (three sons and one daughter) of the Hon. Sir Edward Peirson Thesiger (1842&#150;1928) and his wife, Georgina Mary Stopford (<i>d</i>. 1906). His father was a clerk assistant in the House of Lords and his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27176/', "Frederick Thesiger, first Baron Chelmsford (1794&#150;1878)")</script>, had been lord chancellor. He went to a private school at Weybridge, Surrey, and then to Marlborough College, where he professes to have been lonely and unhappy, and in 1896, at the age of seventeen, he persuaded his father to set aside his plans for his son to follow a conventional civil service career and allow to him to study at the Slade School of Fine Art. He trained there for four years: his fellow students included Augustus John (whom he thought conceited) and Wyndham Lewis. His father was a talented musician who became a friend of the composer Percy Grainger, and Thesiger himself attended some classes at the Guildhall School of Music. For ten years he followed the profession of painter, &#145;oblivious of the fact&#146;, as he writes in his memoirs, &#145;that my pictures were mostly bought out of kindness&#146;  (Thesiger, 40). He enjoyed travel in Europe and life in London, where his privileged family connections, combined with his own charm, courtesy, and ready wit, gave him access to a wide social circle. He married Janette Mary Fernie Ranken (<i>d</i>. 1970) on 29 May 1917. They had no children.<br>
<br>Thesiger's love of acting was fostered in amateur performances while he was still a student at the Slade, and he often took part in amateur theatricals at Christmas parties in his uncle's house in Knaresborough Place, London. Becoming aware that he would never make his fortune as a painter, and encouraged by his success on the amateur stage, in 1909 he arranged an introduction to the actor&#150;manager Sir George Alexander, who gave him his first professional part and &#145;took the trouble to try to teach me to act&#146;  (Thesiger, 89). Engagements followed with Charles Hawtrey and Beerbohm Tree, who gave him his first Shakespearian role as Roderigo in <span class="italic">Othello</span>. From the beginning he was happier in contemporary roles, confessing that he found &#145;&#147;tradition&#148; very hampering&#146;  (ibid., 105).<br>
<br>Thesiger was on holiday in France when the First World War broke out. Returning to England he joined the Queen Victoria rifles as a private soldier; he was injured in France before he reached the front line and he was discharged in 1915, resuming his acting career almost immediately. His first major success followed with his appearance as Bertram Tully in W. W. Ellis's farce <span class="italic">A Little Bit of Fluff</span>, which opened in October 1915 and ran for nearly three years. From then until shortly before his death Thesiger was in almost continuous employment as an actor, playing mostly on the West End stage, but appearing regularly at the Malvern Festival and, occasionally in the post-war years, in the Edinburgh Festival. In 1955 he visited Moscow, playing Polonius to Paul Scofield's Hamlet. His film career began in 1932 in <span class="italic">The Old Dark House</span> and he subsequently appeared in numerous films.<br>
<br>Although he appeared from time to time in works by Shakespeare and other Elizabethan and Restoration dramatists, he was most at home interpreting the characters created by contemporary English dramatists, and he created roles in plays by Arnold Bennett, Eden Philpotts, James Barrie, Somerset Maugham, George Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy, and others. As in his personal life he preferred the deployment of reason, wit and intelligence to grand displays of passion, and in his memoir he comments on the difficulty of appearing to be natural on the stage  (Thesiger, 97&#150;8). He found Shaw the most congenial and helpful of the dramatists in whose plays he appeared; early in the rehearsals for <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> (1924), in which he was to play the Dauphin, he was told by Shaw, &#145;You already know as much about the part as I do&#146;  (ibid., 142).<br>
<br>As well as painting and collecting Victorian glassware, he maintained a lifelong interest in embroidery and needlework. At the end of the First World War, with official encouragement, he set up a short-lived needlework school as an occupation for those who were physically or emotionally disabled by the war, and he published <span class="italic">Adventures in Embroidery</span> in 1941. In the last year of his life, and the fiftieth year of his acting career, he was awarded the order of commander of the British empire. Thesiger died at his home, 8 St George's Court, Gloucester Road, London, on 14 January 1961.<br>
