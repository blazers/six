<span class="headword">Joye,  Peter</span>  (1636&#150;1721), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in August 1636, the son of Peter Joye, senior, a Dutch-born tailor of Blackfriars, London. Apprenticed by the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1653, Joye was brought into trade by the merchant Charles Marescoe in 1669, soon after his marriage on 23 February 1668 to Marescoe's sister, Elizabeth. Joye provided a quarter share in the firm's capital of &pound;28,000 and their business prospered until Marescoe's death in 1670. Joye then took a one-fifth share in a partnership set up by Marescoe's widow, Leonora, but its &pound;10,000 capital proved inadequate to sustain the scale of its predecessor's activities and he withdrew or was ousted from the partnership in 1675.<br>
<br>By then Joye had acquired useful experience of the Swedish iron, pitch, and tar imports in which Marescoe had specialized and he was able to set up his own flourishing trade with the major suppliers. He dealt particularly in the long iron bars known as &#145;voyage&#146; iron or &#145;Guinea&#146; iron, which was in demand for sale in the west African slave trade. Joye invested &pound;400 when the Royal African Company was floated in November 1671 and he was to serve in its court of assistants as a director in 1678&#150;80, 1683, 1683&#150;5, 1688&#150;9, and 1691&#150;5. He soon became one of the company's major contractors, agreeing in 1685 to supply it with 450 tons of bar iron and 40,000 bars of copper. In 1683 he was admitted to the Eastland Company which dealt mainly in Scandinavian and Baltic commodities. He acquired an interest in shipping and in 1676 secured the British government's diplomatic support to recover one of his vessels after its seizure by a Dutch privateer. His specialization in iron, copper, pitch, tar, and hemp made him a valued and increasingly prosperous supplier of naval goods to the Admiralty, and he made substantial loans to the government of William III.<br>
<br>Although he was baptized into the Dutch church at Austin Friars, Joye was a long-standing parishioner of St Dunstan-in-the-East, where he became churchwarden. Living close to the wharves through which passed London's overseas trade, Joye paid rates as one of the most substantial citizens of the Dice Quay precinct, and he later inhabited a large house in Mincing Lane. In 1682&#150;3 and 1689&#150;93 he was a member of the common council as a representative for Tower ward and he was commissioned in the militia lieutenancy for the City of London in 1690 and 1694. He became treasurer of St Bartholomew's Hospital, to which he bequeathed &pound;1000. Politically his sympathies were evidently tory&#150;Anglican, for although he was listed as &#145;good&#146; in a government survey of councilmen in 1681 he was among those liverymen purged by James II in 1687 as hostile to his plans for the toleration of Roman Catholics and protestant dissenters.<br>
<br>With his first wife, who died on 14 April 1680, Joye had three sons, Charles (1670&#150;1737), Peter (1678&#150;1680), and James (1680&#150;1741). On 6 October 1685 he married his second wife, Eleanor (Ellen) Rawlinson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whistler (<i>d</i>. 1729), widow of John Rawlinson. They had no children and lived apart for the latter years of his life. In his will of June 1718 he pointedly left Ellen only a small share in his estate. However, although Charles had followed in his father's footsteps and established himself as a successful Eastland merchant, he had also become heavily involved in the South Sea Company, of which he became deputy governor. He thus shared in the catastrophe of the South Sea Bubble of 1720 and was among those held chiefly responsible. Shrewdly anticipating the confiscation of Charles's estate, valued at &pound;40,105 by a punitive parliament, Peter Joye's last act, on 2 January 1721, was to add a codicil to his will, transferring to James its execution and principal benefits. He died at his house in Mincing Lane on 11 January, and his estate, which included lands in Northamptonshire bought for about &pound;36,000 and financial investments exceeding &pound;56,000, thus passed unscathed to its very numerous beneficiaries, who included the poor of Stockholm, Hamburg, and Malaga, as well as the French and Dutch churches of London, Sion College, and the charity school of St Ann Blackfriars. His widow attempted to have its provisions overturned in chancery on the grounds that Joye was mentally infirm, but was unsuccessful. A memorial to Peter Joye and his first wife was placed in St Dunstan-in-the-East, where he was buried.<br>
