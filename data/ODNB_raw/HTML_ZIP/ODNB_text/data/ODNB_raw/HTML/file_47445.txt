<span class="headword">Chatto,  Andrew</span>  (1840&#150;1913), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 11 November 1840 at 55 Pratt Street, Camden Town, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5190/', "William Andrew Chatto (1799&#150;1864)")</script> and Margaret Roberts, daughter of Luke Birch of Cornhill, London. William was a writer who in the 1840s published books on wood-engraving, card playing, and fishing and was the editor of the <span class="italic">New Sporting Magazine</span>, a daily comic paper. Andrew Chatto, known throughout his life as Dan, was the third of five sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>At the age of fifteen, Andrew Chatto joined John Camden Hotten's publishing firm at 74&#150;5 Piccadilly, London. He rose to become publications manager, and after Hotten's death in 1873 he purchased the business from Hotten's widow for the sum of &pound;25,000. One of Hotten's major coups had been the publication of Algernon Charles Swinburne's <span class="italic">Poems and Ballads</span>, but he had alienated the poet by paying him little if any of the profits from this strong seller. Chatto wooed Swinburne back by sending him a cheque for &pound;50 and a formal request to publish his works. A further advance followed together with an agreement to publish Swinburne's <span class="italic">Bothwell</span>, which clinched the relationship. Hotten's legacy also caused Chatto some legal problems. His cavalier attitude to copyrights meant that some of the firm's works which Chatto had bought were plagiarized and others were not legally his property.<br>
<br>Needing capital for his business, Chatto went into partnership with W. E. Windus, whose first book of narrative and lyric verses Hotten had published in 1871. Windus took little part in the business, leaving the day-to-day arrangements to Chatto, but the partners shared an enthusiasm for sailing which they indulged through Windus's membership of the Royal Thames Yacht Club. Chatto was also a frequenter of the Unity Club, whose members were a bohemian group of authors, singers, critics, newspaper editors, and publishers. There he met George Sims, whom he asked to translate Balzac's <span class="italic">Contes drolatiques</span>, which was published with pictures by Dor&eacute;. Marketed to a general audience, the sale of the work caused a scandal and under threat of prosecution Chatto withdrew the work from circulation.<br>
<br>Where Hotten had been somewhat shady in his business arrangements, Chatto sought to make clear agreements with his authors and protected their copyrights as best he could from piracy. He also performed various other services for his authors, from arranging the sale of subsidiary rights to organizing the shipping of personal belongings overseas, a favour he did for Marie Louise de la Ram&eacute;e (Ouida). In return he expected reasonable adherence to deadlines, prompt return of proofs, and restraint when it came to authors' corrections. His businesslike dealings with authors resulted in considerable success. Frank Swinnerton recalled how &#145;according to Arnold Bennett he had a sure answer to any novelist who demurred to his terms for the purchase of a book. The answer was &#147;I have the cheque in my pocket&#148;&#146;  (Swinnerton, 50).<br>
<br>In the 1870s Chatto invested in many new copyrights, buying rights to all the existing works of best-selling novelists such as Wilkie Collins and Ouida. He successfully reprinted them in cheap editions, making them widely available and cornering a substantial share in the novel market. He relied on his own judgement in selecting the novelists and was his own reader, keeping touch with fashions in demand by personally taking subscription orders from the largest circulating libraries, Mudies and W. H. Smiths. Chatto was most successful at marketing his novels to appeal to the English public. Sometimes this merely involved a change of title, other times he reordered the text itself, as in a collection of American short stories that he resequenced. By employing such marketing techniques Chatto became &#145;a master in novel publishing&#146;  (Swinnerton, 50).<br>
<br>Seeing periodicals as a vehicle for the firm's fiction, Chatto acquired from Mrs Braddon <span class="italic">The Belgravia</span> and the <span class="italic">Belgravia Annual</span>. From 1882 to 1911 he also published <span class="italic">The Idler</span>, an outlet for the essays of Jerome K. Jerome, and the firm also handled the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Chatto selected and issued the first novels of Hall Caine, Grant Allen, W. H. Mallock, and David Christie Murray, and the &#145;yellow backs&#146; that the firm published included the most popular authors of their day. Walter Besant, James Rice, Mrs Henry Wood, Anthony Trollope, George Macdonald, Charles Reade, and Justin MacCarthy all published with Chatto, and many of their works were sold in the firm's <span class="roman">Piccadilly Novel</span> series. On the whole, his novelists remained loyal to their publisher, although he firmly resisted their attempts to meddle in the business of publishing, and was briskly frank about their profitability. For those whose popularity waned this was too much; Ouida &#145;never liked&#146; Chatto and Windus  (Weedon, 1999). For others his plain manner was a boon; R. L. Stevenson said in October 1884:<blockquote>To parody an old Scotch story of servant and master: if you don't know that you have a good author, I know I have a good publisher. Your fair, open and handsome dealings are a good point in my life. (Schneller, 113)</blockquote>In 1875 Chatto made a deal with Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) to publish <span class="italic">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span> on 25 per cent commission. Despite losing an estimated $10,000 through a pre-emptive edition by Belford Brothers, who were Chatto's representatives in Canada, Clemens continued to publish with him. The firm also had a good working relationship with Harper Brothers, enabling them to offer simultaneous publication in the United States and Britain at a time when international copyright did not extend to America.<br>
<br>A year after his deal with Clemens, Chatto purchased the remainder of Henry George Bohn's stock and copyrights (the Bohn's libraries had previously been sold to George Bell &amp; Sons). This led to an expansion in the range of books published by the firm. They included poetry, criticism, history, and social science books, and a few titles in the arts and sciences. Some reference works had come his way and he published <span class="italic">Walford's County Families of the United Kingdom</span>. This extra business led to extending the partnership to Percy Spalding, who gradually took over Chatto's role in the business, and to a move in 1880 to new London offices at 214 Piccadilly. In 1905 Philip Lee-Warner joined the firm as a partner and brought in Sir Israel Gollancz to supervise the <span class="roman">Kings Classics</span> and the <span class="roman">Medieval Library</span> series. The firm established a line of art books, setting standards for book production.<br>
<br>In 1909 Windus retired, and three years later Chatto followed suit. At this time one of his employees described him as &#145;a gentle elderly man with a rolling walk, genially sweet in manner to every member of his staff, and much loved&#146;  (Swinnerton, 50). He was below average height, heavily built, and balding but with a bushy beard and a pince-nez. The eldest of his sons followed him into the business and became a nominal partner in the firm in 1893, although his real interests were outdoors. A younger son, Thomas, joined the antiquarian firm of Pickering and Chatto. Chatto was greatly interested in the progress of modern science and astronomy and spent much of his leisure time in this study. As a diversion he played the cello and gardened. He died at his home, Larkrise, Aldenham Road, Radlett, Hertfordshire, on 15 March 1913 and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 18 March.<br>
