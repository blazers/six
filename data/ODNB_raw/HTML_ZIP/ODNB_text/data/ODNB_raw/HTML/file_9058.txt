<span class="headword">Faed,  Thomas</span>  (1826&#150;1900), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born on 8 June 1826 at Barley Mill, Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire. He was the fourth of six children of James Faed (1777&#150;1843), engineer and millwright, and Mary McGeoch (1790&#150;1866). Two of his elder brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33064/', "John Faed (1819&#150;1902)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66796/', "James Faed (1821&#150;1911)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33064/', "Faed, John")</script>], also became painters. Thomas attended Girthon School as a boy and showed early talent as a painter; his first oil painting, <span class="italic">Interior with Figures</span>, which was executed on a linen apron when he was twelve years old, is now in Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum. In 1842 he became an apprentice draper in the nearby town of Castle Douglas. However, after the death of his father in the following year Faed was invited to join his brother John in Edinburgh. There he assisted in painting miniatures and was admitted to the Trustees' Academy. He studied under Sir William Allan and, more importantly, under Thomas Duncan, who took the colour class. He enjoyed much success and in 1847 he won the life class prize with his oil painting <span class="italic">A Life Study of John Mongo</span> (1847; &#145;The Punka-Walla&#146;, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh). On completion of these studies he attended the Royal Scottish Academy life school from 1849 to 1852.<br>
<br>Even as a student Thomas Faed was a successful exhibitor at the Royal Scottish Academy annual exhibitions, his first accepted work being a watercolour entitled <span class="italic">Scene from the Old English Baron</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1844). In common with his Scottish contemporaries, many of Faed's early subjects were drawn from literary sources: he painted a series of incidents from Sir Walter Scott's novel <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span> in the late 1840s, and in 1849 he produced a major work, an imaginary group portrait entitled <span class="italic">Sir Walter Scott and his Friends at Abbotsford</span> (Scot. NPG). In recognition of his early success Faed was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1849 at the tender age of twenty-three. In 1851 he sent three works to the Royal Academy in London: all were hung and from then on he was a regular exhibitor there until 1893. The following year his painting of Scottish rural life, <span class="italic">The Patron and Patroness's Visit to the Village School</span> (1852, exh. RA, 1852; Dundee Museums and Art Galleries), was hung well in the Royal Academy. It demonstrated the popularity of Faed's paintings based on Scottish rural life and drawing heavily on his own childhood memories. At this stage in his career he laid emphasis on narrative, detail, and the fine qualities of light, contrasting with his later Scottish subjects, which were very heavily laden with sentiment, even poignancy.<br>
<br>In 1852, evidently encouraged by early success and following in the footsteps of other ambitious Scottish painters, Faed moved to London, where he was based for the rest of his life. He continued to paint subject pictures on Scottish themes, both individual figure subjects and also themes dealing with wider, serious issues. His painting <span class="italic">The Mitherless Bairn</span> (1855, exh. RA, 1855; National Gallery of Australia, Melbourne) was a great success in its day. It appealed to Victorian sentiment with its portrayal of an orphan child being taken in by poor cottagers; its depiction of anecdote from Scottish rural life followed in the popular tradition of Sir David Wilkie. During this middle period of Faed's career he also painted a series of works on the theme of Scottish emigration: his <span class="italic">Sunday in the Backwoods</span> (also called <span class="italic">The Scottish Emigrants' Sunday in the Backwoods</span>, 1859, exh. RA, 1859; Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal), for example, portrays the emigrants' struggle to honour the sabbath in the wilderness. This series culminated in <span class="italic">The Last of the Clan</span> of 1865 (exh. RA, 1865; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), which portrays the old and infirm remnants of the clan MacAlpine sadly watching all its young members sail away to the New World.<br>
<br>In 1861 Faed became an associate of the Royal Academy. Since moving to London he had resigned his associateship of the Royal Scottish Academy but, in recognition of his success in London, he became an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1862. In 1864 he was elevated to the rank of academician in London and deposited a figure subject, <span class="italic">Ere Care Begins</span>, as his diploma work (1865; RA).<br>
<br>Shortly after his arrival in London Faed married, on 9 November 1852, Frances Mary Rand (<i>b</i>. 1829/30); they had a son and a daughter. There are many portraits of Faed, in which he cuts a dash as a dark, handsome, and well-dressed man; John Ballantyne's 1865 portrait <span class="italic">Thomas Faed in his Studio</span> (Scot. NPG) catches him <i>in situ</i>. As a successful artist Faed enjoyed prosperity not only through the sale of his works but also from the judicious sale of the copyright on many of his most popular paintings; published as prints, they were particularly successful in North America. Towards the end of his life Faed's eyesight deteriorated. He was forced to rely on exhibiting earlier paintings and gradually he ceased to appear at the Royal Academy altogether. He died at 20 Loudoun Road, St John's Wood, London, on 17 August 1900, and was survived by his two children, John Francis and Beatrice.<br>
