<span class="headword">Prujean,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1706), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments</span>, was first apprenticed for eight years to Thomas Alcock in the Clockmakers' Company on 6 May 1646, then turned over to Elias Allen, the foremost London instrument maker of the period. There is no record that Prujean took his freedom, but on 11 March 1664 he matriculated as a <i>privilegiatus</i> (a non-academic member of the University of Oxford), thus acquiring the right to trade in the city as a mathematical instrument maker. He remained there for the rest of his life, living in New College Lane in the parish of St Peter-in-the-East, an area which was particularly favoured by craftsmen and tradesmen with strong university connections. From there he worked both for the university, its colleges and buildings, and for the mathematics tutors in the colleges. Publications by Oxford mathematicians such as Richard Holland and Thomas Edwards carried advertisements for Prujean, and the small number of surviving instruments by him include several made of printed paper pasted on wood, suggesting that they were designed to appeal to the undergraduate and &#145;poor scholar&#146; market.<br>
<br>In 1685 Prujean prepared a plan of the duke of Monmouth's march at Sedgemoor which he presented to Arthur Charlett. In 1688 he was paid 8<i>s</i>. for his part in the restoration of the dial of the church of St Mary the Virgin, and in 1689, with Henry Wildgoose, he repaired &#145;gratis&#146; the dial of his parish church. To accompany the instruments he sold, Prujean printed a number of instruction sheets, of which the few surviving examples have been listed by Bryden  (266), and in 1701 he issued a <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> of his production. This very short, slightly old-fashioned list is historically important as the earliest example of such a record known from outside London. Despite this gently innovative activity, the instruments Prujean offered related strictly to the traditional mathematical arts and he does not seem to have prospered from them. He died in Oxford in 1706, being at that time, according to Hearne  (3.347), &#145;very poor, wanting bread&#146;. His nameless widow, despite the efforts of Edmond Halley and others, was refused a place in Crosse's Hospital, Ampthill, Bedfordshire. He was buried in Oxford on 10 September 1706.<br>
