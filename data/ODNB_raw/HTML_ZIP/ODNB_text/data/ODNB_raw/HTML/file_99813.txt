<span class="headword">Cole,  Michael</span>  (1928&#150;2008), <span class="occ">scientist and inventor</span>, was born on 18 October 1928 at 27 Welbeck Street, Marylebone, London, the oldest child in the family of two sons and one daughter of Captain Awdry Valentine Connor (Henry) Cole (formerly Witkowsky), and his second wife, Marguerite Eleanor Mary Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gooch, daughter of Charles Edwin Gooch, of Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, Essex. His father, born and educated in India, was descended from a Polish Jewish family which had emigrated to Chicago in 1848. Having amassed a fortune at a very young age by selling insurance in India, he came to England in 1906, was commissioned in the British army, and (by then a captain in the 7th North Staffordshire regiment) was wounded in 1916 at Gallipoli.<br>
<br>Cole grew up in Cannes, where his parents had started a fashionable tennis club, and in the late 1930s the family moved to Salcombe, Devon, where Cole's father was occupied in ship salvage, and later in farming. Cole was educated at Eton College, and after national service in the Royal West African Frontier Force in the Gold Coast, where he arrested Kwame Nkrumah, wrongly suspected of being responsible for the riots of 1948, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1948 to read natural sciences. He graduated with an upper second in 1951, and after completing a PhD in metallurgy, awarded in 1955, he won a King George VI fellowship and spent 1954&#150;5 at the University of Chicago. He returned to Cambridge as a research fellow at the Cavendish Laboratory. On 26 November 1960 he married Susan Mary Fellowes (<i>b</i>. 1936), daughter of William Albemarle Fellowes, land agent, of Sandringham, Norfolk; they had two daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Cole did not want to become an academic, and in 1957 he founded Metals Research, in a loft over a garage in King Street, Cambridge, and began work on the processes required for growing and preparing samples of single metal crystals, then beginning to be in great demand in solid state physics laboratories, especially in the aircraft, space, weapons, and semi-conductor industries. Single metal crystals allowed the structure of the metals to be studied in its purest form, but were difficult and expensive to produce. Over the next few years Cole developed both the processes for crystal growing, and a range of innovative equipment, including specialized furnaces and a spark erosion machine, the Servomet, which could cut and shape crystals without damaging their structure. In 1960 he was joined by his brother David to manage the business side of the company, leaving him free to concentrate on technical matters and product development. With the invention of the Quantimet Image Analysing Computer, which used a television camera, a microscope, and a computer to analyse the appearance of surfaces and images, and was developed by Colin Fisher, later technical director of Metals Research, into a highly versatile and powerful instrument with applications in a wide range of industries, the company grew rapidly. In 1965 Metals Research was able to buy Moat House, Melbourn, a country house outside Cambridge, and build a new laboratory and workshops in its grounds. In 1969 Cole introduced the Quantimet 720, which used a digital image analysis system, and the workforce grew to some 500 by the early 1970s. Subsidiary companies were established in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia, and about three-quarters of production was exported. Metals Research won three queen's awards for Industry. In 1975, looking to expand further and exploring the possibility of acquiring another company, and with support from the Labour government and the National Enterprise Board, Metals Research made a reverse takeover of Scientific and Medical Instruments Ltd, part of the former Cambridge Instrument Company, founded by Horace Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, a century earlier. The new company, Cambridge Analysing Instruments Ltd, despite receiving a queen's award in 1976, ran into difficulties from falling sales levels in the difficult financial climate of the late 1970s, especially after the change of government in 1979, and in 1979 Cole resigned.<br>
<br>In 1982 Cole bought Genevac, a company that made laboratory vacuum pumps, with the intention of improving its products. This led to the invention of a vapour vacuum pump, based on the principle of &#145;lift&#146;, which worked according to the &#145;Cole vacuum principle&#146;. This could pump corrosive acids and solvent vapours quickly, without the need for regular maintenance, whereas a normal pump would disintegrate. Sales of the new pump were slow in taking off, and as the cost of the development of the pump escalated, and despite successive refinancing, Genevac was forced into liquidation, following the breakdown of a proposed collaboration with an American company. Cole was left deeply in debt, and lost both his house and his pension. At this point his brother bought the defunct company from the receiver, and with the help of his wife and his son Harry, Cole resumed work on the development and sale of his pump. Later, in 1994, he invented an evaporator for use in the pharmaceutical research industry which could process hundreds of samples simultaneously and evaporate many times faster than previous evaporators without overheating the thermolabile samples, leaving a purer substance. This was a huge success, and Cole opened an office in New York, increased the workforce to 150, and achieved a turnover of &pound;15 million. After winning his fifth queen's award in 2000, Cole sold the company to an American instrument company, after a bidding war between two instrument groups.<br>
<br>After the sale of Genevac, Cole started a new research company to explore ways of cultivating cep (or porcini) mushrooms (<i>Boletus edulis</i>) commercially, something that people all over the world had been working on, unsuccessfully, for years. Although he failed to find a solution, he came to the conclusion that the explanation lay with electricity, and that there was a correlation between the charged air caused by thunderstorms, and the growth of ceps. To test this hypothesis he experimented with a metal tree with platinum roots, planted in his garden. At the end of his life Cole became interested in climate change, reaching the conclusion that there was little scientific basis for the view that manmade carbon dioxide caused global warming, and that the predictive computer models used were based on false assumptions. Cole was mentioned in the debate on climate change in the House of Lords on 21 May 2009.<br>
<br>As an inventor, Michael Cole was a genius, and his confidence and determination kept him going. Even when facing enormous financial difficulties, over and over again he refused to accept that something was impossible, and thought of a way to do it. Metals Research was one of the first high technology companies in the country, and Cole was a key figure in the industrial renaissance in Cambridge in the 1960s. A big man and a bon viveur, he enjoyed flying, sailing, and skiing, was passionate about music, and was also a keen gardener and a fine bridge player. He and his brother bought Osea Island, off the Essex coast, and used to fly their families there for their holidays. He also often flew to France and back for lunch in his favourite restaurant in Le Touquet. He died on 6 April 2008 at his home, Moor Farm, Friston, Saxmundham, Suffolk, of cancer, and was survived by his wife and children.<br>
