<span class="headword">Cuninghame,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1775&#150;1849), <span class="occ">writer on prophecy</span>, was born at Bridgehouse, Ayrshire, the only son of William Cuninghame (<i>d</i>. 1804) of Bridgehouse (who in 1779 purchased the estate of Lainshaw, near Stewarton, Ayrshire) and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James Campbell, merchant, of Glasgow. He was educated in Kensington, London, later studying at Utrecht University before taking up an appointment in the Bengal civil service. While in India he came under the spiritual influence of the Baptist missionary William Carey. In 1804, upon the death of his father, Cuninghame inherited the Lainshaw estate and returned to Scotland. In 1818 he established a sabbath school in nearby Stewarton, subsequently seceding from the Church of Scotland after his views on grace and the atonement were criticized, his reasons being given in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Narration of the Formation of a Congregational Church at Stewarton</span> (<i>c</i>.1822). He criticized the kirk session's decision of 1826 to prohibit Wesleyan ministers (teachers at his school) from receiving communion in the church. Between 1827 and 1843 he served as minister of a Congregational church in Stewarton, providing funds for the construction of a large meeting-house and comfortable manse, and a suitable endowment. As patron, in 1839 Cuninghame led the successful protest against the proposed division of the parish of Stewarton by the presbytery of Irving, sparking off the celebrated Stewarton case (1839&#150;43); this in turn made the Scottish Disruption almost inevitable.<br>
<br>Cuninghame spent much of his time on his Lainshaw estate, where he developed an interest in scientific agriculture. Unmarried, his increasing deafness caused him to withdraw from much of outside life and to concentrate instead on the writing of over twenty books on prophecy and biblical chronology. He also published widely in a number of religious journals, especially the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, sometimes under the pseudonym Talib or Sophron. Most influential of Cuninghame's numerous publications were his <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Seals and Trumpets of the Apocalypse</span> (1813; rev. edn, 1817), which argued for a wholly literal interpretation of the prophecies, especially those of the second coming, and his <span class="italic">Letters and Essays &hellip; on &hellip; Israel</span> (1822), which established that the Messiah would reign on earth at Jerusalem over the restored Jews, and that their restoration to Palestine would be a critical step in the &#145;end times&#146;. Always interested in missions, he was an active supporter of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews and the Continental Society. His <span class="italic">Letter &hellip; on &hellip; Jewish Colonisation</span> (1849) urged the formation of a society to promote the agricultural settlement of believing Jews in Palestine. A complete list of his works can be found at the end of his <span class="italic">The Fulfilling of the Times of the Gentiles, a Conspicuous Sign of the End</span> (1847).<br>
<br>When Cuninghame was tempted away from Lainshaw it was usually to attend some gathering connected with the burgeoning prophetic movement, such as the first of the celebrated Albury conferences (1826) organized by another wealthy Scot, Henry Drummond. Here and elsewhere Cuninghame advanced the &#145;historicist&#146; view of prophecy, dominant in protestant theology, which asserted the progressive and continuous fulfilment of prophecy from the time of Daniel, the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophet, through to that of John, author of the <span class="roman">Revelation</span> (as opposed to the &#145;futurist&#146; view advanced by John Nelson Darby and the Plymouth Brethren, which claimed that the larger part of the <span class="roman">Apocalypse</span> was still to be fulfilled at some future date). His writings were deeply pessimistic: he believed the world to be &#145;in the midst of the last great earthquake which precedes the second Advent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, 1814, 759). Despite his opposition to the futurist position, Cuninghame came to accept the notion of the &#145;rapture&#146;, or the coming of Jesus in the air to take away his church prior to the commencement of the great earthly tribulation, albeit not the &#145;secret rapture&#146; advanced by many of his prophetic rivals. The &#145;2300 year&#146; question was at the centre of his polemical contribution to contemporary prophetical debate. In offering an interpretation of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 8:14 he claimed that the number 2300 (which in the text refers to days, but is understood as years) is correct, as opposed to Jerome's claim in favour of 2200 and the later <span class="roman">Septuagint's</span> claim in favour of 2400. His determined views on the minutiae of prophetic speculation, however, brought him into sharp conflict with several leading prophetic scholars, including George Stanley Faber, James Hatley Frere, Edward Irving, and the historian Samuel R. Maitland. His correspondence with the prominent evangelical Edward Bickersteth led to the latter's conversion to premillennialism  (<span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, 1850, 284). Cuninghame died at Lainshaw on 6 November 1849 and was buried there. With Faber and Frere, he ranks at the forefront of prophetic scholarship during the first half of the nineteenth century.<br>
