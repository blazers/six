<span class="headword">Warter,  John Wood</span>  (1806&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, born on 21 January 1806 in Cruck Meole, Shropshire, was the eldest son of Henry de Grey Warter (1770&#150;1853) of Cruck Meole, who married, on 19 March 1805, Emma Sarah Moore (<i>d</i>. 1863), daughter of William Wood of Marsh Hall and Hanwood, Shropshire. Upon leaving Shrewsbury School (under Samuel Butler) Warter matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1824, and graduated BA with third-class honours in classics in 1828, MA in 1834, and BD in 1841. In 1830 he published a translation of the <span class="italic">Acharnians</span>, <span class="italic">Knights</span>, <span class="italic">Wasps</span>, and <span class="italic">Birds</span> of Aristophanes.<br>
<br>Warter was a close friend of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26056/', "Robert Southey")</script>, whose eldest surviving daughter, Edith May Southey (1804&#150;1871), he married at Keswick on 15 January 1834. Many letters from Southey to him, beginning on 18 March 1830, are in the sixth volume of <span class="italic">Southey's Life and Correspondence</span>. Ordained in 1830, Warter was from 1830 to 1833 chaplain to the British embassy at Copenhagen, and became an honorary member of the Scandinavian and Icelandic literary societies. During these years he travelled through Norway and Sweden, was closely acquainted with the leading scholars of northern Europe, including Professor Rasmus Rask, and was supplied with books from the royal library of Denmark. By this means he became an expert in &#145;Danish and Swedish lore, and in the exquisitely curious Icelandic sagas&#146;, and read &#145;German literature of all sorts, especially theological&#146;. In 1834, just before his marriage, he had been appointed by the archbishop of Canterbury to the vicarage of West Tarring and Durrington, Sussex, a peculiar of the archbishopric, to which the chapelries of Heene and Patching were then annexed. He remained the vicar of West Tarring from 1834 until his death. For some years to 31 December 1851 he was the rural dean.<br>
<br>From the date of his appointment to this benefice he devoted his leisure &#145;to the pleasant task of rescuing from oblivion every fact that had the remotest bearing upon the history of Tarring&#146;  (D. G. C. Elwes and C. J. Robinson, <span class="italic">A History of the Castles, Mansions, and Manors of Western Sussex</span>, 1876, 231). The result was the publication of a valuable antiquarian work, <span class="italic">Appendicia et pertinenti&aelig;: parochial fragments on the parish of West Tarring and the chapelries of Heene and Durrington</span> (1853), and <span class="italic">The Seaboard and the Down, or, My Parish in the South, by an Old Vicar</span> (2 vols., 1860), describing the social life of the parish's inhabitants. Selections from Warter's collections on the history of his native Shropshire appeared in <span class="italic">An Old Shropshire Oak</span>, edited by Richard Garnett (4 vols., 1886&#150;91). These books displayed his wide reading.<br>
<br>Warter died at his vicarage on 21 February 1878, and was buried with his wife in West Tarring churchyard (the epitaphs are printed in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> (6th ser., 7, 1883, 306, 517). Their second son, John Southey Warter (1840&#150;1866), was a physician.<br>
<br>Warter was an old-fashioned churchman of the &#145;high and dry&#146; school, and was frequently in dispute with the ecclesiastical commissioners. He published many tracts and sermons, which reflected his orthodox divinity. Although most of his works concerned religious and antiquarian topics, his greatest service to scholarship has been held to be his collection of material relating to Robert Southey  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</span>, 505&#150;6). Warter edited volumes 6 and 7 of Southey's <span class="italic">Doctor</span> and an edition in one volume of the whole work (1848). He also edited Southey's <span class="italic">Commonplace Book</span> in four volumes (1849&#150;51), and four volumes of <span class="italic">Selections from Southey's Letters</span> (1856). A fierce review of the latter work by Whitwell Elwin appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, March 1856, 456&#150;501. It was probably provoked by Warter's statement that he could draw up &#145;a most remarkable history&#146; of that periodical, following a dispute over the use of Southey's letters to Lockhart and Murray. Edith Warter had begun in 1824 and continued for some time a collection of sayings. It was taken up by her husband and finally published in 1861 as <span class="italic">Wise Saws and Modern Instances: Pithy Sentences in Many Languages</span>. Warter also contributed to the <span class="italic">English Review</span>.<br>
