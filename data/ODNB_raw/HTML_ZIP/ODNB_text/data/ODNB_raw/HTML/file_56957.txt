<span class="headword">Whipple <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stirrup]</span>,  Dorothy</span>  (1893&#150;1966), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 26 February 1893 at 9 Edgeware Road, Blackburn, Lancashire. She was the second of eight children (two of whom died, leaving ten years between the older and younger siblings) of Walter Stirrup (1865&#150;1955), architect and land agent, and his wife, Ada, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cunliffe (1868&#150;1942), who had come from &#145;an old-fashioned sort of family: nine children living with their parents in a comfortable house&#146;&#151;as her daughter would write in her memoir of her own idyllic childhood  (Whipple, <span class="italic">The Other Day</span>, 15). In 1900 the Stirrups moved from the &#145;steep terrace&#146;  (ibid., 39) where Dorothy was born to Elmbank, 52 St Silas's Road; to Hillside, East Park Road, in 1903; to The Hawthorns, 41 Dukes Brow, in 1906; and also at this time began to spend summers (previously spent on the Isle of Man) at Mylah Cottage, Rimington, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, 25 miles from Blackburn. From 1905 to 1910 Dorothy Stirrup contributed more than forty short stories (mostly about fairies, that were first tried out on her younger siblings) to the <span class="italic">Blackburn Weekly Telegraph's</span> &#145;Children's corner&#146;. She went to Miss Barrett's school in nearby Shear Bank Road, then from 1903 to 1905 attended Blackburn high school (which she disliked because she was unsporty and her writing was dismissed as plagiarism), and from 1905 to 1911 the convent of Notre Dame, after which she spent a year in France at a convent at Sens-sur-Yonne. On her return she started work as secretary to the director of education for Blackburn.<br>
<br>In the first week of the war her friend George Owen was killed; she never forgot him, remaining close to his sister Gwen for the rest of her life. Briefly, she tried to be a Red Cross nurse; however, she &#145;fainted at operations, cried when the patients cried&#146;  (<span class="italic">Time</span> magazine, 21 Nov 1932). On 1 August 1917 at Gisburne parish church near Rimington, she married her employer, (Alfred) Henry Whipple (1869&#150;1958), a widower with a first from Cambridge whose career in the education service had begun in the year his second wife was born. The couple lived at Glenesk, 8 Merlin Road, Blackburn. In 1925, when Henry Whipple became director of education there, they moved to 35 Ebers Road, Nottingham, later spending weekends at nearby South Lodge, Newstead Abbey, Linby.<br>
<br>Despite her early work it seemed not to have occurred to Dorothy to write more than the occasional short story (and at first she must have hoped to have children) until, a decade after her marriage, she completed a novel. <span class="italic">Young Anne</span> (1927) suffered only one rejection before being taken by Jonathan Cape (&#145;I'm not lost any more. I know what I have to do with my life. I have to write&#146;; Whipple, <span class="italic">Random Commentary</span>, 11) but they rejected <span class="italic">High Wages</span> (1930), saying it would not be a commercial success (it has rarely been out of print since), so that John Murray became her British publisher for all her books except two volumes of non-fiction and a final volume of short stories. (Whipple was a great success in America, was translated into many languages, and was published by Tauchnitz.) Her novels are domestic, have &#145;a kind of North-Country Jane Austen quality&#146;  (J. B. Priestley, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Sept 1966) and in all of them &#145;her characters struggle sturdily towards individual salvation. Though she is perfectly aware that too high a price may be paid for security, she realises that without it dignified living is impossible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, February 1937). Hugh Walpole described <span class="italic">Greenbanks</span> (1932), a Book Society choice, as:<blockquote>a picture of a quite ordinary English family &hellip; with some of the best creation of living men and women that we have had for a number of years in the English novel &hellip; in Mrs Whipple we have a new novelist who will in all probability be of true importance. (<span class="italic">Book Society News</span>, September 1932)</blockquote>Six more novels appeared between 1934 and 1953&#151;<span class="italic">The Priory</span> (1939), which was partly based on Newstead, was also a Book Society choice&#151;and three volumes of short stories in 1935, 1941, and 1961. <span class="italic">They Knew Mr Knight</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">They were Sisters</span> (1943) were made into successful films in 1944 and 1945.<br>
<br>In 1939, upon Henry Whipple's retirement, he and Dorothy moved to Barton End, 1 Ridgeway Road, Barton Seagrave, near Kettering, partly in order to be near her sister. <span class="italic">Someone at a Distance</span> (1953), the only novel not set in or around Blackburn or Nottingham, can now be seen as Whipple's most important book&#151;yet it received no major reviews and was the first of her novels since <span class="italic">Young Anne</span> not to be a Book Society choice or recommendation. A reply from the publisher to his depressed author gave a partial explanation: &#145;editors have gone mad about action and passion&#146;  (John Murray archive, NL Scot.); and she may have remembered St John Ervine's remarks fifteen years before when he dubbed her &#145;one of the best story-tellers we have &hellip; but [he implies &#147;which is why&#148;] the editor of <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> seems not to have heard of her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Good Housekeeping</span>, January 1937). She was to be passed over for another ten years. Whipple also had the disappointment of seeing her last volume of short stories&#151;eventually dubbed &#145;illuminating and startling&#146; by Anthony Burgess  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 6 April 1961)&#151; rejected by Murray and not finding a publisher for several years. Towards the end of her life she wrote three successful children's books, as well as <span class="italic">Random Commentary</span> (1966), an autobiography compiled from her working notebooks 1925&#150;45.<br>
<br>Upon her husband's death in 1958 Dorothy Whipple immediately returned to Blackburn, to 3 Whinfield Place, but lived there for only seven years before dying from a stroke on 14 September 1966 at the Royal Infirmary, Blackburn. She was cremated at Pleasington on 16 September.<br>
