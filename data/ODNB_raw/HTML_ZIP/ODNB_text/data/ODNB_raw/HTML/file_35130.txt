<span class="headword">Moullin,  Eric Balliol</span>  (1893&#150;1963), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and university teacher</span>, was born at Sandbanks, near Parkstone, Dorset, on 10 August 1893, the only child of Arthur Daniel Moullin, a civil engineer from an old Guernsey family, and his wife, Charlotte Annie Longman. He was delicate in childhood and was educated privately, learning at home the mathematics that won him a scholarship to Downing College, Cambridge. He sat part one of the mathematical tripos in 1913, then embarked on the mechanical sciences tripos. In 1914 ill health forced him to abandon his studies but the following year he returned and in 1916 obtained a first class in the tripos and gained the John Winbolt prize in 1918. Unfit for military service, from 1917 he was a lecturer at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. He married, on 2 January 1918, Christobel (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), daughter of Edward Schr&ouml;der Prior, Slade professor of fine art at Cambridge; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1919 Moullin returned to the Cambridge Engineering Laboratory where he was a very active teacher and research worker for the next ten years. During this time he was attached to King's College as an assistant director of studies. In 1929 he was offered the chair of engineering at Oxford but withdrew with characteristic generosity in favour of R. V. Southwell. He then accepted the newly founded Donald Pollock readership (under Southwell) and two years later became a fellow of Magdalen College. His first marriage having ended in divorce, Moullin married, on 15 December 1934, Joan Evelyn Sinnock (<i>b</i>. 1904/5), daughter of Louis Francis Salzman, a medievalist and sometime editor of the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span>.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Moullin joined the Admiralty signals establishment at Portsmouth and in 1942 transferred to the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd of Manchester. At the end of the war he was appointed to the chair of electrical engineering at Cambridge, which had just been founded through the sponsorship of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers Association. He was elected to a professorial fellowship at King's in 1946. He retired in 1960. He was awarded the Cambridge ScD in 1939 and was made an honorary LLD of Glasgow University in 1958.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Moullin was an active member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He was chairman of the radio section at the outbreak of war, served on council from 1940 to 1949, latterly as vice-president, and was then president for the session 1949&#150;50; in 1963 he was made an honorary member. He was also a governor of the College of Aeronautics until 1949 and a member of the Radio Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, 1934&#150;42.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Moullin was a very original and creative research worker. He was a prolific writer of scientific papers and books. His first book, <span class="italic">The Theory and Practice of Radio Frequency Measurements</span> (1926), had a considerable influence on the development of radio systems. As a boy he had been a radio amateur helped by his father in a workshop at their home in Swanage and almost to the end of his life he delighted in working in the attic laboratory at his home in Cambridge. Best known of his many inventions was the Moullin valve voltmeter developed during the 1920s, which became a standard laboratory instrument. His second and most important book, <span class="italic">The Principles of Electromagnetism</span> (1932), formed the basis of his own lectures and had a profound influence by its unique blend of theory and practice. His last book, the <span class="italic">Electromagnetic Principles of the Dynamo</span>, was mostly written before the end of 1933 but was delayed until 1955 by pressure of other research. His central contribution to the study of electromagnetism was his insistence that the sources of fields are their most important feature and that these sources can be controlled by the engineer to achieve desired effects.<br>
<br>The range of subject matter of these books demonstrated their author's grasp of the whole field of electrical engineering. Although Moullin disliked narrow specialization he was no generalist but had rather a distrust of general statements. He loved detail and delighted in particular cases, on which he focused his powerful mind and which he studied so carefully that they became windows through which one could see a whole landscape. He was an outstanding teacher of engineers, reinforcing his lectures with beautifully designed experiments. He was daily in the laboratory, where he showed a personal interest in individual students and in members of his staff, both academics and technicians. From his research students he called out the best. He did not praise often, but his praise was worth having.<br>
<br>Moullin saw no conflict between academic and industrial engineering, being as much at home in the factory as in the college. He treated colleagues in industry as full partners in a professional enterprise and was an energetic supporter of industrial training schemes. In the university he was a fighter for academic freedom, which he felt was endangered both by central government and by academics in search of power and influence.<br>
<br>He had a keen sense of history and was delighted when he inherited, in 1947, the Fief des Eperons in Guernsey. On Elizabeth II's visit to the island in 1957 he carried out, as seigneur, his feudal duty of presenting the gilt spurs to the reigning monarch. His scarlet doctor's gown added a splash of colour to the ceremony. He did much work on Guernsey parish registers and wrote several antiquarian papers for La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Guernsesiaise. In his will he endowed a prize at Downing College for the best student in engineering or history. Moullin died at his home, 21 Sedley Taylor Road, Cambridge, on 18 September 1963. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
