<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Corbett,  Richard</span>  (1582&#150;1635), <span class="occ">bishop of Oxford and of Norwich, and poet</span>, was born at Ewell, Surrey, the son of Vincent Corbett (<i>d</i>. 1619), a nurseryman at Whitton, near Twickenham, and his wife, Benet (<i>d</i>. 1634). He was educated at Westminster School before going up to Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in 1598. Later that year he was elected a student at Christ Church, where he graduated BA on 20 June 1602 and proceeded MA on 9 June 1605. In 1612 he was senior student at Christ Church and served as junior proctor, pronouncing funeral orations in the university for both Prince Henry and Thomas Bodley. On 26 March 1613, in defiance of the canons of 1604, he was ordained deacon and made priest on the same day by John Bridges and at much the same time he identified himself in Christ Church with the emerging anti-Calvinists in his Passion Sunday sermon for 1613 when he &#145;insisted upon the Article of Christ's descending into Hell, and therein grated upon Calvin's manifest perverting of the true sense and meaning of it&#146;  (P. Heylin, <span class="italic">Cyprianus Anglicus</span>, 1668, 68). In 1616 he was recommended for election to the projected Chelsea College. For his Oxford BD on 8 May 1617 he defended the tenet that sacraments do not confer grace <i>ex opere operato</i>, a discussion of the possible misinterpretation arising from article 30 of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>; he proceeded DD on the same day. In 1618 Corbett left Oxford for a tour of France, described in a letter to his friend and student contemporary at Christ Church, Sir Thomas Aylesbury, and the following year he inherited some landed property in the City of London after his father's death.<br>
<br>It was in 1620, however, that Corbett's ecclesiastical career began to gather momentum. In Aylesbury he was fortunate to have a ready supplicant at court: having been secretary to the first earl of Nottingham when he was lord high admiral, Sir Thomas was retained when the Howards fell from power by Nottingham's successor as admiral, George Villiers, then marquess of Buckingham. In 1620 Corbett became not only rector of Puttenham, Hertfordshire, and a canon of Salisbury, but also in June dean of Christ Church; his 1622 poem &#145;A New Yeare's Gift to my Lorde Duke of Buckingham&#146; (BL, Harley MS 1221, fol. 75<i>v</i>) makes it clear that he regarded Buckingham as the agent for his securing the deanery. (This work was named only in the first printed volume of Corbett's poetry, 1648, when Buckingham was incorrectly described as a duke, a title he did not hold until May 1623.) Much of Corbett's poetry was aimed at post-hunting, and it was as a poet rather than a priest that his Oxford friends celebrated his elevation at Christ Church (&#145;In admissionem decani Corbet oratio&#146;; Christ Church, Oxford, MS 325, fol. 8). About 1620 Corbett married Alice (1602&#150;1628), daughter of his subdean, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14297/', "Dr Leonard Hutten (1556/7&#150;1632)")</script>, the antiquary, and his wife, Anne Hamden. A journey north undertaken by Corbett and his father-in-law one August inspired <span class="italic">Iter boreale</span>, Corbett's most widely circulated poem.<br>
<br>By 1621 Corbett was also a royal chaplain and from that time was routinely listed among the twenty-one annual Lent preachers at court. He was not always at ease in the royal pulpit. During the 1621 summer progress he was called to preach before James I at Woodstock and there mangled his words and managed to tie the strings of his preaching bands with the royal ring he had just received, an event which still provoked comment years later. Corbett's friendship with Buckingham allowed him sufficient intimacy to help dissuade the duke from inclining to Catholicism during 1622 and 1623. Soon after the abortive negotiations for the Spanish match Corbett wrote to his patron on 23 February 1624, again seeking his help toward further promotion in the church; but when, on 30 July 1628, shortly before Buckingham's assassination, Corbett was nominated to the vacant see of Oxford it was primarily to make room in the deanery for Dr Brian Duppa, at the behest of the queen's chamberlain, the fourth earl of Dorset.<br>
<br>In the absence of any official residence for the bishop of Oxford, Corbett continued to live at Cassington, where he had become rector in 1622, despite repeated attempts to have his first fruits remitted and to regain the use of Gloucester Hall, Oxford. For a time Corbett seems to have been more concerned about his accommodation than his episcopal ministry: the only occasion on which he is recorded as consecrating other bishops was at the Croydon consecration of William Piers, for Peterborough, in October 1630, and from a letter from Archbishop Abbot to Secretary Dorchester it emerges that he had to be sent for by authority. It was presumably at Laud's request that Corbett assisted at the baptism of the duke of York at St James's in November 1633; Corbett had clearly sought to endear himself to Laud&#151;when the latter became chancellor of the university he was among the first in Oxford to write to congratulate him, sending him congratulatory verses by way of cultivating his patronage  (Christ Church, Oxford, MS 325, fol. 35).<br>
<br>Contemporaries knew Corbett as a wit, &#145;as his poems, jests, romantic fancies, and exploits which he made and performed extempore showed&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.594), but as a prankster he was not always so much liked and even as a bishop he could be inclined to inappropriate behaviour in the wine cellar if John Aubrey is to be believed  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.186). He was later remembered, in the high table gossip of one college, more for his <i>bons mots</i> than for action. In November 1634 the subject of the positioning of the holy table came up for discussion in the Queen's College and it was recalled that the conformist Corbett had said that &#145;he could not away with any tick-tack conformity&#146;  (diary of Thomas Crosfield, Queen's College, MS 390, fol. 174<i>v</i>). He also apparently complained that George Birkhead at Bletchingdon let his church &#145;lay more undecent&#146; than Corbett's own stable but that it had been made good with marble  (ibid.). In the diocese he insisted upon decorous church order in his primary visitation of 1629, asking expressly whether &#145;any man or boy in time of divine service cover his head, or sit with his hat upon his head &hellip; or doth not use all other gestures and behaviours in time of divine service required in that 18 cannon&#146;.<br>
<br>As his chaplains Corbett appointed men as gregarious as himself&#151;William Strode, the university orator, and Thomas Lushington, in whose favour he resigned his prebendal stall at Salisbury. Lushington followed Corbett from Oxford when on 7 May 1632 he was translated to the see of Norwich to make room for John Bancroft (who would do so much financially for the diocese and to assist Laud's buildings at St John's College). Corbett was bishop of Norwich for little more than three years, during which he made little impression on the vast diocese and may have inclined towards lax toleration. Whereas at his Oxford visitation Corbett had relied predominantly on those of John Howson (in 1619), his 1633 articles for the diocese of Norwich conformed closely to the 1619 set issued by John Overall. However, he followed Laud's policy of closing stranger churches, turning out the Walloon congregation that had used the bishop's chapel since 1619. He insisted upon the conformity of George Burdett, the truculent lecturer of Great Yarmouth, who had failed to make his Easter communion in 1633 and had roundly prayed that God was to be worshipped spiritually and not with any physical gestures. Corbett also encouraged his clergy to support the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral, admonishing one synod to bear in mind the benefits that all of them had had from sheltering in it.<br>
<br>Corbett died in Norwich on 28 July 1635, &#145;like a Roman, bravely&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/298/10) as George Garrard reported to Viscount Conway, at the comparatively young age of fifty-three. By his will, drawn up three weeks earlier, he left &pound;1000 to his daughter Alice (1625&#150;1682) and the residue of his estate to his son Vincent (<i>b</i>. 1627). Probate was granted on 5 September to the executrix, Corbett's mother-in-law, Anne Hutten, to whose care the children had been entrusted, their mother having died of smallpox in April 1628. Corbett was buried in Norwich Cathedral.<br>
