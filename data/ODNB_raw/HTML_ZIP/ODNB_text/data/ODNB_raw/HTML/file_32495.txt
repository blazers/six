<span class="headword">Collen, Sir  Edwin Henry Hayter</span>  (1843&#150;1911), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 17 June 1843 at Somerset Street, London, the son of Henry Collen (<i>b</i>. 1798), miniature painter, of Holywell Hill, St Albans, and his wife, Helen Dyson. Educated at University College School, London, Collen passed to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and became lieutenant, Royal Artillery, on 1 July 1863. He first served in the Abyssinian expedition (1867&#150;8). After passing through the Staff College at Camberley in 1871&#150;2, with honours, he was transferred to the Indian army in 1873. In the same year he married Blanche Marie Frederika, daughter of Charles Rigby JP, of Soldiers' Point, Anglesey.<br>
<br>Collen was promoted captain on 1 July 1875. His efficiency as secretary of the Indian ordnance commission of 1874 led to his entering in 1876 the military department of the government of India as assistant secretary. Newly appointed, in June 1876 he submitted at Simla a memorandum proposing the formation of an intelligence branch in the quartermaster-general's department, modelled on that in Britain. Both the Indian commander-in-chief, Sir Frederick Haines, and his quartermaster-general, Roberts&#151;who wrote that Collen's memorandum was &#145;singularly able&#146;  (Fergusson, 73)&#151;generally agreed with Collen's proposal, and so for a year (1877&#150;8) he was attached to the intelligence branch at the War Office to study and report on it. His lengthy report (October 1878) described the British branch, and asserted the benefits of an Indian intelligence branch, based on the British model but adapted to Indian requirements. Collen's memorandum and report were instrumental in the establishment of the Indian military intelligence branch. Moreover his report later became an important historical source&#151;&#145;a detailed and invaluable inside view of the Intelligence Branch at the War Office during the late 1870s&#146;  (Fergusson, 59).<br>
<br>Collen acted as deputy assistant quartermaster-general at the Delhi durbar of 1 January 1877. In 1878 he was appointed secretary of the Indian army organization commission. His administrative talents were recognized in 1880, in the later phases of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when as assistant controller-general he was mainly responsible for the relatively smooth and efficient working of the supply and transport system.<br>
<br>Collen's routine work was interrupted by a short spell of active service. Promoted major on 1 July 1883, he joined the eastern Sudan expedition of 1885, and served with distinction in the intelligence department and as assistant military secretary to Major-General Sir Gerald Graham VC. He served at Tamai (2 April 1885) and Thukul (5 May), was mentioned in dispatches, and received the brevet of lieutenant-colonel (15 June 1885).<br>
<br>On his return to India, Collen was appointed in 1886 accountant-general, and in 1887 military secretary to the government of India, serving an exceptional nine years in the post. On 15 June 1889 he became full colonel, and in April 1896 military member of the executive council. During his administration many improvements were made in the composition of commands and regiments, in military equipment, and in mobilization. The defects in army administration revealed by the South African War (1899&#150;1902) gave fresh impetus to Collen's activities, but desirable reforms had to be postponed due to financial constraints. In the debate on the budget in the legislative council on 27 March 1901 Collen summarized the army improvements. The Indian army was being rearmed with the latest weapons, the building of factories for the manufacture of war material had already been begun at Wellington, Kirkee, and Jubbulpore, a scheme for decentralization had been drawn up, and a remount commission had been established. Fresh drafts of officers were added to the Indian army and staff corps, and the supply and transport corps were reorganized. Lord Curzon, viceroy from 1899 to 1905, considered Collen inadequate as military member&#151;&#145;mentally composed of India-rubber&#146;  (Gilmour, 192)&#151;and his department inefficient. Nevertheless publicly he stated that Collen &#145;had left an enduring mark on the personnel, the organisation and the equipment of the Indian army&#146;  (Curzon, 2.265). Like other Indian army officers, Collen opposed the appointment of Kitchener as commander-in-chief in India, claiming he lacked Indian experience, and would offend people and turn everything upside down. However, reforms inaugurated by Collen were continued by Kitchener.<br>
<br>Collen was promoted major-general on 18 January 1900 and lieutenant-general on 3 April 1905. He was made CIE in 1889, CB in 1897, and KCIE in 1893. He was made GCIE on his retirement in April 1901, and in May of that year represented India at the opening of the first parliament of the Australian commonwealth. He served on the War Office regulations committee from 1901 to 1904, and as chairman of the Staff College committee of 1904. When the controversy between Curzon and Kitchener on army administration broke out in 1905, Collen actively supported Curzon's views on keeping a military member on the council. A zealous member of the British Empire League, the National Service League, and the Essex Territorial Association, he was a frequent speaker and contributor to the press on military subjects, and published books on the British and Indian armies. He died on 10 July 1911, at his residence, The Cedars, Kelvedon, Essex. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and a daughter.<br>
