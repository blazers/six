<span class="headword">Browne, Sir  Benjamin Chapman</span>  (1839&#150;1917), <span class="occ">engineer and shipbuilder</span>, was born on 26 August 1839 at Stouts Hill, Uley, Gloucestershire, the youngest of the three sons of Colonel Benjamin Chapman Browne (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1853) of the 9th lancers and later of the Gloucestershire yeomanry, and his wife, Mary Anne Lloyd, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker, of Hardwicke Court, Gloucestershire. He grew up in the Cotswolds, and went on to Westminster School. Although none of his family had any connection with engineering or business, he decided to study applied science and spent a year at King's College, London, before starting a mechanical engineering apprenticeship with William Armstrong at the Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1856. In 1861 he married Annie Buddle, daughter of Robert Thomas Atkinson (1807&#150;1845), a mining engineer, of High Cross House, Benwell, Newcastle. They had nine children, two of whom died in early childhood; three sons and four daughters survived him. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32120/', "Edward Granville Browne (1862&#150;1926)")</script>, became professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge in 1902.<br>
<br>For nearly ten years Browne worked as a civil engineer, first with James Abernoethy at Falmouth harbour, from 1861 to 1862, then with the Tyne Commission, working on the Tyne pier, from 1863 to 1865, and finally on the staff of Sir John Coode on the Isle of Man, where he was employed at the Port Erin works and also worked on the landing pier at Douglas.<br>
<br>In 1870, with the help of his friend Thomas Hodgkin, the Newcastle banker, of Hodgkin, Barnett &amp; Co., Browne became senior partner in the group which bought the Forth Banks Engine works of R. and W. Hawthorn in Newcastle, set up in 1817. Intending to concentrate on the manufacture of marine engines, in 1871 the firm acquired the site of a former shipyard and built the St Peter's works, a new marine-engine works, while modernizing the antiquated Forth Banks works and installing new machinery, in order to continue to make locomotives, because of demand from the North Eastern Railway Company. The marine engineer Francis Carr Marshall (1831&#150;1903) was in charge of the St Peter's works, and it was he who was responsible for the growing reputation of Hawthorns' marine engines. In 1874 orders for gunboat engines began to come in, and Hawthorns went on to supply engines to governments all over the world, including Austria, France, Italy, Chile, China, and Japan. Marine engines became increasingly important to the success of the business, and in 1882 the St Peter's works was enlarged: by 1885 marine engines accounted for more than 80 per cent of the firm's output. Browne was responsible for starting the manufacture of a steam tram at Forth Banks, which he described in a paper to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 1880: it was not a commercial success, and only eight trams were made.<br>
<br>In 1876 Browne became a trustee of his wife's family's estates, which included several large collieries, and in the early 1880s he considered withdrawing from Hawthorns in order to devote more time to their administration. But after the retirement of the iron shipbuilder Andrew Leslie from Andrew Leslie &amp; Co., Leslie's partner, Arthur Coote, anxious to acquire a machine engine works, approached Hawthorns about the possibility of a merger and, despite Browne's opposition to the idea, in 1886 R. and W. Hawthorn amalgamated with Leslie &amp; Co. to form R. and W. Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Co. Ltd. Browne agreed to become chairman of the new company, and remained until 1916. In the late 1880s the company began to build torpedo boats and destroyers at the Hebburn yard, and under Herbert Rowell, shipyard manager from 1891, became a major supplier of marine engines, steam turbines, and destroyers to the Admiralty. It continued the strong links with Russia built up by Andrew Leslie from the 1860s, supplying naval ships for the Russian volunteer fleet. Hawthorn Leslie also built refrigerated ships, beginning its connection with the New Zealand frozen meat trade. The marine-engine works at St Peter's continued to prosper, and although the Forth Banks works was never as successful it continued to manufacture locomotives and also added water-tube boilers. By 1914 the total workforce was over 5250, and the annual turnover was more than &pound;1.5 million. Browne's other business interests included the Newcastle and District Electric Light Company.<br>
<br>Browne was interested in economic and social questions, and was a member of the Newcastle Economic Society. His first experience of industrial unrest, the 20 week strike on Tyneside in 1871 in support of a nine-hour day, when the inflexibility of the employers prolonged the strike and led to victory for the workers, convinced him of the importance of good relations between employers and their employees. He joined the Iron Trades Employers' Association, and worked hard to improve his relations with his own workers. He publicly supported trade unionism, and as a member of the Engineering Employers' Federation, which he had helped to found in 1896, he played a crucial role in the great lock-out of 1897, following the demand by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers for an eight-hour day. Although he was opposed to strike action, he was willing to compromise, and believed in personal contact with the trade-union leaders. Browne was regarded as an authority on industrial relations, and was often asked to give evidence to royal commissions, including the 1904 royal commission on trade disputes and trade combinations. He wrote articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and elsewhere on questions relating to capital and labour, and contributed a chapter, &#145;The relations between capital and labour: the standpoint of capital&#146;, to <span class="italic">After-War Problems</span> (1917), edited by William Harbutt Dawson.<br>
<br>A JP in Newcastle, Northumberland, and Gloucestershire, Browne was elected to Newcastle town council in 1879 and served as mayor of Newcastle from 1885 to 1887. He was responsible for the success of the Royal Jubilee Exhibition and the Royal Agricultural Show in Newcastle. He was knighted in 1887. He played an important part in the founding of the North East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders, serving as president from 1898 to 1900, and he was closely involved in setting up the Durham College of Physical Science (later Armstrong College, which became part of the University of Newcastle in 1963). The University of Durham made him an honorary DCL in 1887.<br>
<br>Like his mother Browne was a devout member of the Church of England and a disciple of the Oxford Movement. He died on 1 March 1917 at Westacres, Benwell, Newcastle upon Tyne, his home since 1887.<br>
