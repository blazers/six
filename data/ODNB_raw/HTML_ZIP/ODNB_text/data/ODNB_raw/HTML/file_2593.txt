<span class="headword">Blakeway,  John Brickdale</span>  (1765&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, the eldest son of Joshua Blakeway, of Shrewsbury, and Elizabeth, sister of Matthew Brickdale, merchant and MP in several parliaments for the city of Bristol, was born at Shrewsbury on 24 June 1765. He was educated initially in the free school there (1772&#150;5). From 1775 to 1782 he attended Westminster School, from where he went to Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1786 and proceeded MA in 1795. Disappointed in his hopes of election to a fellowship at Oriel, he left the university and entered Lincoln's Inn; he was called to the bar in 1789. He followed the law more for pleasure than as a means of support, and worked on the Oxford circuit, where he was quite successful, despite having a slight speech impediment. The collapse of the family fortunes, however, compelled him to earn his living. The legal profession proved too expensive, and Blakeway resolved to enter the church. He was ordained in 1793.<br>
<br>In 1794 Blakeway was presented by his uncle the Revd Edward Blakeway, then mayor of Shrewsbury, to the ministry of the royal peculiar of St Mary's, Shrewsbury. On his uncle's death in 1795 he became official of the peculiar, and also succeeded to the vicarage of Neen Savage, Shropshire, and the rectory of Felton, Somerset. In October 1797 he married Mary-Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Thomas Wilkieson, a Hamburg and Dutch merchant, formerly of Blackheath. They were happily married, but had no children. In 1800 he was presented to the vicarage of Kinlet, Shropshire. From 1800 until 1816 he divided his time between Kinlet and Shrewsbury, but, finding it inconvenient to keep up two houses, he gave up Felton and Kinlet in 1816, and subsequently lived only in his native town.<br>
<br>Comfortably settled with his various livings, Blakeway found time to turn to antiquities, which became his favourite pursuit. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1807. Blakeway's main works are <span class="italic">A History of Shrewsbury</span> (2 vols., 1825), written in collaboration with Hugh Owen, and <span class="italic">The Sheriffs of Shropshire</span> (1831). He also contributed fifty-six notes to the Boswell&#150;Malone edition of Shakespeare (1821).<br>
<br>Although he had suffered from asthma as a child, Blakeway was generally in good health until he began to suffer from a tumour on his hip in around 1823. It was operated on in early 1826, but he died on 10 March 1826 at the Council House, Shrewsbury, which had been his home since 1815. He was buried in St Mary's Church, where a fine Gothic monument, by John Carline, was erected to his memory by his parishioners.<br>
<br>Much of Blakeway's work remained in manuscript. His topographical history of Shropshire was published posthumously by the Shropshire Archaeological Society in 1905&#150;7. His quick mind and good memory, combined with great industry and his legal training, made his work highly respected by contemporaries, although it was increasingly superseded by that of specialist students of the next generation.<br>
