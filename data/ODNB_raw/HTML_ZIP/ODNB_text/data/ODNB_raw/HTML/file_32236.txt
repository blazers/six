</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Caillard, Sir  Vincent Henry Penalver</span>  (1856&#150;1930), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born in Kensington, London, on 23 October 1856, fifth child and eldest son of Camille Felix D&eacute;sir&eacute; Caillard (1822&#150;1898) of Wingfield House, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, who was at his death the longest serving county court judge, and his first wife, Emma Louisa (1827&#150;1865), daughter of Vincent Stuckey Reynolds of Canonsgrove, Taunton. His maternal grandmother was first cousin to George Basevi and Benjamin Disraeli, earl of Beaconsfield. He had three brothers, one half-brother, and five sisters. He was educated at Eton College (1869&#150;72) and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1875), where he was a gold medallist. He was commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1876.<br>
<br>During 1879&#150;80 Caillard helped to delineate the new Balkan borders when, following defeat in the Russo-Turkish War, the Ottoman empire ceded independence to Serbia, Romania, and Montenegro. He served initially as an assistant commissioner on the Montenegrin frontier commission and was later sent on special missions to Epirus and Dulcigno. During 1882 he worked in the intelligence branch of the War Office before Sir Charles Dilke obtained his appointment to the headquarters staff of Sir Garnet Wolseley in Egypt.<br>
<br>It was possibly to Dilke's influence that Caillard owed his appointment in 1883 to succeed Edgar Vincent, afterwards Viscount D'Abernon, as financial representative of Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands in Constantinople, alternating with French representatives as president of the council of administration of the Ottoman public debt. This body managed tobacco, silk, wine, and salt revenues in the interests of foreign creditors, and many higher administrative or financial questions were under its sanction. Caillard reorganized its administration and modernized its methods of sericulture and viticulture. In Constantinople he soon developed a taste for sinuous intrigue. He had a cosmopolitan outlook, was somewhat reserved in manner, and was inclined to overstretch himself. Admired by some for his tact, initiative, and ambition, he was also distrusted as meddlesome, self-seeking, and unrealistic. In the late 1880s he headed a group seeking the concession to build the strategic Anatolian Railway, but his manoeuvres were over-elaborate, and the concession was jockeyed into German control partly as a result of his muddling.<br>
<br>In 1898, when Caillard's father died, he inherited his Wiltshire property, resigned from the Ottoman public debt, and was nominated by Ernest Cassel as a director of the National Bank of Egypt (1898&#150;1908) and the armaments manufacturers Vickers. After becoming financial director of Vickers in 1906, he was a leading power in the strategy and management of one of Britain's most diversified and dynamic industrial combines. He travelled widely on its behalf, and was engaged in many international negotiations of byzantine complexity, notably for the erection of arsenals in Turkey and Russia (1913&#150;14). The collapse of the company's internal accounting system during the wartime expansion of 1914&#150;18, and its purchase of rolling-stock and electrical companies associated with Dudley Docker for inflated prices in 1918&#150;19, were misfortunes for which Caillard was responsible. After a long decline, he was forced to retire from Vickers in 1927. He was a director of many associated companies, as well as the London, Chatham and Dover (1905&#150;22) and other railways.<br>
<br>Caillard composed musical settings for the <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence</span> of William Blake and had other artistic interests. From the 1880s he professed strong anti-German sentiments and supported many patriotic causes. In 1885 he contributed articles on Albania, Bulgaria, and Turkish finance to the radical-imperialist <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (vols. 43 and 44), and his later articles in the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, particularly &#145;Industry and protection&#146; in vol. 75 (1920), proved a decisive influence in the decision of Joseph Chamberlain to launch his protectionist campaign. As chairman of the tariff commission in 1904, as unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary candidate for Central Bradford in 1906, in articles, speeches, committees, and clubland cabals, at the Royal Colonial Institute and the Compatriots' Club, Caillard worked for imperial tariff preference and British world hegemony. He strove hard to assert the interests of large-scale manufacturing in British policy: in 1916 he joined Docker in founding the Federation of British Industries (of which he was president in 1919) and in the same year, together with other Vickers directors, he formed the London Imperialists (renamed the British Commonwealth Union), which tried to increase the influence of business leaders in parliamentary life. In the 1890s he privately corresponded on Turkish affairs with Lord Salisbury, and in 1917 he was an intermediary between David Lloyd George and Basil Zaharoff when the latter was entrusted with negotiations to bribe Turkish politicians with &pound;10 million in gold to accept peace terms.<br>
<br>Caillard was knighted in 1896 and held several decorations. His name was suggested for a peerage by his country neighbour Walter Long in 1923. He married first, in 1881, his stepsister, Eliza Frances (1859&#150;1926), sister of Sir John Hanham, ninth baronet, and daughter of Captain John Hanham, whose widow became Caillard's father's second wife. By this marriage Caillard had one son and one daughter. He married secondly, in 1927, Zo&euml; Gertrude (1868&#150;1935), widow of John Oakley Maund (<i>d</i>. 1902), rentier, and daughter of Robert Ellis Dudgeon, physician. Caillard died of pneumonia at 63 boulevard Victor Hugo, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Paris, on 18 March 1930, following an operation at the American Hospital in Paris, and was buried on 26 March at St Mary's Church, Wingfield.<br>
