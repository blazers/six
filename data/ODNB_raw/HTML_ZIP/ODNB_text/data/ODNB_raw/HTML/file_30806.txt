<span class="headword">Clark,  Thomas Archibald  Bennet-</span>  (1903&#150;1975), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 13 January 1903, the only son and youngest of four children of Thomas Bennet-Clark JP, accountant and senior partner in the firm of R. and G. Scott, chartered accountants of Edinburgh, and his wife, Anne Chalmers Hanna. His interest in botany was kindled at an early age by his father, whom he accompanied on excursions to Ben Lawers and Norway in search of alpine plants. Educated first at Wells House School, Malvern Wells, from 1912 to 1916, he went on to Marlborough College in 1916 and won an open entrance scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1920. He gained first classes in both parts of the natural sciences tripos in 1922 and 1923 (specializing in botany in part two) and, in the latter year, won the Frank Smart prize for botany.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Bennet-Clark developed a passionate interest in plant physiology, to which he was to devote his whole career. Following graduation he began research at Cambridge with F. F. Blackman. Two years later he became assistant at Trinity College, Dublin, to Professor H. H. Dixon. He completed his Cambridge PhD at Dublin. While in Ireland, on 22 September 1926, he married Elizabeth Constance, daughter of the Revd James Haythornthwaite, rector of Rathmines parish, Dublin. They had two children, Margret Aithna (<i>b</i>. 1929) and Henry Chalmers (<i>b</i>. 1934).<br>
<br>In 1930 Bennet-Clark was appointed lecturer in botany at the University of Manchester. In 1936 he became the first professor of botany at the University College of Nottingham and, in 1944, professor of botany at King's College, London; finally, in 1962, he became professor of biology and first dean of the school of biological sciences, at the University of East Anglia, Norwich.<br>
<br>Bennet-Clark's contributions to plant physiology were in three distinct fields: the metabolism of organic acids in succulent plants, particularly members of the Crassulaceae; the water relations of plant cells, especially in connection with the possible existence of an active water uptake mechanism; and finally, the isolation, identification, and mode of action of plant growth hormones, in which he was the first (with N. P. Kefford) to use chromatography to separate naturally occurring plant growth regulating compounds.<br>
<br>Bennet-Clark published only thirty papers, but the quality and originality of his work, and its incisive and critical nature, engendered immense interest and worldwide research activity. He was an excellent university teacher, who placed more emphasis on stimulating enthusiasm in his subject than on the ground covered. Possessed of an encyclopaedic mind and photographic memory, he could discuss almost any topic in botany from an informed and authoritative standpoint. He thought botany should be taught entirely by rigorous experiment and viewed taxonomy and ecology as more suitable for amateurs, though there were few more knowledgeable field botanists. His belief that plant and animal biology should be taught in an integrated manner bore fruit when he founded the school of biological sciences at the University of East Anglia. He did his utmost to support and encourage both colleagues and students, but he could not stand laziness or pomposity, and did not suffer fools at all. He could appear unreasonable&#151;but this was the result of the enormous demands made on him, together with a certain professorial forgetfulness. Being asked to take one of his lectures might have been considered an honour until it was explained that the lecture should have begun about five minutes beforehand.<br>
<br>Bennet-Clark served on many national and international bodies. He founded and edited (1950&#150;60) the <span class="italic">Journal of Experimental Botany</span>, and gave outstanding service to the Agricultural Research Council (from 1957 until 1967), the Royal Society, the Society for Experimental Biology, and many other organizations. His workload left him little time for hobbies, although he enjoyed gardening, especially scrounging and acquiring plants, and carpentry, at which he was probably rather too impatient to become really skilled.<br>
<br>Bennet-Clark was a man of small stature, who often wore a patched suit and a wide-brimmed trilby hat while riding a bicycle through London traffic. He was known equally well to the keepers of the Palace of Westminster and the porters of the Royal Society and King's College as the professor who parked his bicycle in the most inappropriate places. He was an adventurous driver and many preferred public transport to a lift in his unusual cars, which bore unmistakable evidence of encounters with London Transport buses. Nevertheless, he was well liked and respected by colleagues and students. His outstanding contributions to plant physiology were recognized by his election to a fellowship of the Royal Society (1950) and an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1969), the award of honorary DSc degrees by the universities of Leicester (1968) and East Anglia (1968), and appointment as CBE (1966).<br>
<br>Bennet-Clark retired in 1967 and withdrew completely from the academic and public scene, first to his home in Essex and subsequently to a beautifully restored medieval tenement flat in the Canongate, Edinburgh. After a distressing illness he died on 24 November 1975 at Glencairn Towers Nursing Home, 8 Chalmers Crescent, Edinburgh.<br>
