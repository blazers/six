<span class="headword">Hibbert,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was born at Marple in Cheshire, the son of William Hibbert, gentleman, and his second wife, Alice, daughter of Geoffrey Mottershead of Mottram, Cheshire. He matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 21 January 1620 and graduated BA in 1622. He was instituted in 1625 to the vicarage of Preston in Holderness, Yorkshire, where he remained undisturbed until the outbreak of civil war when he fled from the parliamentarian forces, who removed him from his living. He served briefly as a chaplain in the royalist army and in 1643 he petitioned the crown for the living of Hotham, which had been abandoned by the incumbent. By 1647 he had made his peace with parliament and was back in Cheshire as vicar of Mottram, where his mother's family resided, but by 1651 he had returned to Yorkshire as minister at Settrington in the East Riding. He was appointed vicar at Holy Trinity, Kingston upon Hull, in 1652, when he seems to have held presbyterian views, although his fellow minister John Shaw did not make him welcome. For the next few years the ministers and congregations at Hull were divided between the presbyterians and the Independent followers of John Canne, chaplain to the garrison there, so that the chancel and nave of Holy Trinity were partitioned by a brick wall to provide separate spaces for worship for each group. While at Hull Hibbert published <span class="italic">Waters of Marah</span> (1654), based on two funeral sermons for the children of William Lyne, who had died the previous year.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Hibbert was removed from Hull, possibly as a result of his unwillingness to conform, but his views soon adapted to the new regime. On Restoration day 1661 he preached a loyal sermon at St Paul's Cathedral before the lord mayor, which was published as <span class="italic">Regina dierum, or, The Joyful Day</span>. He was made a chaplain to James, duke of York, to whom his theological treatise, <span class="italic">Syntagma theologicum</span> (1662), was dedicated, and honours soon followed. He was made a BD at Cambridge in 1664, as a member of St John's College, and a DD of Oxford the following year. In 1662 he had been instituted to the rectory of All Hallows-the-Less in London, and on 22 September that year was added the vicarage of St Olave Jewry. He was collated to the prebendal stall of Chamberlainwood in St Paul's on 12 January 1669, which he held along with his parochial livings until his death in September 1678. He was buried in St Olave's Church on 24 September. Hibbert had married Mary, daughter of William Kirkman of Toadhole in Derbyshire, with whom he had two sons who died young and seven daughters, four of whom survived him, as did his wife, who died on 1 November 1705. Hibbert's career provides an example of one who negotiated the religious troubles of mid-century effortlessly, and he died a prosperous cleric.<br>
