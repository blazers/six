<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cassels, Sir  Robert Archibald</span>  (1876&#150;1959), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Bandra, near Bombay, on 15 March 1876, the son of John Andrew Cassels, merchant, of Red Litten, Prince's Risborough, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Helen, daughter of Thomas White. He was educated at Sedbergh School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was commissioned in 1896, and went to India in the following year, before joining the 32nd Lancers in 1901. He acted as aide-de-camp to his divisional commander (1906&#150;7), was brigade major (1909&#150;11), and general staff officer, grade 2 (GSO2) in 1911&#150;13. He had married on 9 June 1904 Florence Emily, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Halkett Jackson, and they had one son, the army officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64054/', "Sir James Halkett Cassels")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1915 Cassels became deputy adjutant-general at the headquarters of the force, the nucleus of which had landed in Mesopotamia late in 1914. Before the end of 1915, however, he became GSO1 with the 3rd Indian army corps; he moved to the 14th division in May 1916, and by August 1917 had served in the same capacity with the small cavalry division and as brigadier-general, general staff, of the expeditionary force. When in early April 1917 Sir Stanley Maude advanced north astride the Tigris, Cassels manoeuvred with masterly skill on the left flank, and on 22 April at Istabulat he was sharply engaged.<br>
<br>By now regarded as a coming man, Cassels took command of the 11th cavalry brigade in November 1917. When his great opportunity came in the final offensive of 1918 he revealed himself as an even more outstanding cavalry leader than his promise had foretold. His orders were to reach with his brigade the Little Zab River 25 miles above its junction with the Tigris. He marched 77 miles in 39 hours, but unexpectedly found about a thousand Turks holding the ford for which he was making. None the less he decided to cross, managing to do so by another ford about a mile downstream. Ismael Hakki, his flank turned, skilfully crossed to the right bank of the Tigris and broke up his floating bridge. On 25 October the brigade received orders to cross the river next day above Sharqat and cut off the enemy. Cassels decided he must find a ford near Huwaish, but had to go farther north before one was discovered, all three channels of which were highly dangerous. Most of the horses had to swim; Cassels led the way and rode at a gallop to Huwaish. He had ordered another regiment to join him, but the ford could not be crossed in darkness, so he was isolated and in considerable danger. He estimated the Turkish force nearest to him, 2&frac12; miles south of Huwaish, at four hundred or more.<br>
<br>Early on 27 October, Cassels took the bold decision to attack, mainly to disguise his weakness. The action disclosed the Turkish strength to be between eight hundred and a thousand. Cassels therefore drew back and dug in. The Turkish main body facing the infantry under Sir A. S. Cobbe was doing the same thing at Sharqat. In the early hours of 28 October, Cassels was reinforced by an infantry brigade which had marched 33 miles to join him, and he felt encouraged to try a bluff. A considerable force of the enemy was moving towards him from the south and he sent the 7th hussars, less two squadrons, to meet it. A brilliant dismounted attack drove the enemy back, and though they came on again and forced the hussars to retire, they showed no further signs of attacking. The brigade suffered about a hundred casualties and lost many more horses. In the course of the action the 7th cavalry brigade arrived, and a few more reinforcements came up later.<br>
<br>On 29 October the 13th hussars carried out a dashing attack, first galloping into dead ground unscathed, then dismounting, swarming up a height known as Cemetery Hill, driving off the Turks, and taking 730 prisoners. 29 October was the day of the battle of Sharqat. How great was the part played by Cassels is made clear by the fact that, although the British infantry attack was repulsed, nevertheless next morning white flags fluttered all down the Turkish line.<br>
<br>Cassels next led his forces north to occupy Mosul, but could not induce the Turks to abandon the place until they received the terms of the armistice. He was appointed CB and DSO in 1918 and promoted major-general in 1919. In June of that year serious unrest in southern Kurdistan disturbed the tribes north and north-east of the Mosul vilayet. His commander, Sir Theodore Fraser, being absent, Cassels took immediate steps to prevent the spread of the rebellion. He acted with his usual vigour, with the consequence that after some months of fighting the Kurds had been so handled that they scarcely stirred in the subsequent general Arab revolt.<br>
<br>Cassels was cavalry adviser in India (1920&#150;23), commandant of the Peshawar district (1923&#150;7), and adjutant-general in India (1928&#150;30), being promoted lieutenant-general in 1927 and general in 1929. He next held the Indian northern command (1930&#150;34) in the course of which he became colonel of the 7th light cavalry. (He was appointed colonel of his regiment, which had become the 13th (DCO) Lancers, in 1939.) In 1935 came his final promotion to commander-in-chief of the army of India and member of the executive council of the governor-general, an appointment lasting until 1941 when he went on retired pay. Within a few weeks of taking over Cassels had to face one of the familiar troubles on the north-west frontier. Afridi bands, set in motion by the &#145;Red Shirt&#146; movement, which in its turn was coached by Russian agents, penetrated to Peshawar, and one Indian battalion refused duty. Cassels speedily restored order. Later he undertook the building of a series of blockhouses across a plain which actually lay outside the administrative borders of India. The creation of these defences brought another threat of frontier war but this he succeeded in averting.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1939 brought a host of problems, foremost among them the expansion of the Indian army, which grew with a rapidity so great that it far outstripped the available equipment. One of the strategic factors Cassels had already anticipated when in May 1936 he had been directed to examine road and rail facilities for moving a division to the Burma frontier and its maintenance there. He estimated that the programme would take eight years, or five if sole reliance were placed in a road from Manipur. He was eager to go ahead at once, but this project was not accepted. Many officers of promise served under Cassels, but the prot&eacute;g&eacute; who seemed to excel them all was Claude Auchinleck, a close friend to whom he acted to some extent as mentor and who served with him in Mesopotamia and on his staff in India. Auchinleck, who was to succeed him as commander-in-chief, for his part thought Cassels had certain of the characteristics of Rommel.<br>
<br>Cassels was appointed KCB in 1927, GCB in 1933, and GCSI in 1940. After his retirement he lived at Copthorne, in Sussex, where he took a prominent and useful part in local affairs. He was always very uncommunicative about his military experiences and never spoke of them even to his son, who was to become General Sir James Cassels, chief of the general staff, Ministry of Defence (1965&#150;8).<br>
<br>Cassels's greatest assets were his determination and his <i>coup d'&#339;il</i> on the battlefield. He was prepared to gamble, as he did at Sharqat, and gambling boldly and skilfully is proverbially a necessity for the successful leader, but he did not make a single mistake in that campaign and was never abandoned by fortune. His sense of duty and probity equalled his extreme modesty. Cassels died at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst, Sussex on 23 December 1959. Lady Cassels survived her husband.<br>
