<span class="headword">Owenson <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>MacOwen]</span>,  Robert Nugent</span>  (1744&#150;1812), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in the barony of Tyrawley, co. Mayo, Ireland, the son Walter MacOwen and his wife, Sydney Bell. His parents were poor, and he was principally educated in a hedge-school. He converted to protestantism, Anglicized his name, and travelled to London about 1765, under the patronage of an Irish absentee landlord who had recently returned from the West Indies and had been impressed by hearing Owenson sing. With the assistance of Thomas Augustine Arne, who declared him to have one of the finest baritone voices he had ever heard, particularly in falsetto, Owenson took singing lessons from John Worgan.<br>
<br>Owenson's earliest known appearance as a singer was in 1770 at Vauxhall Gardens, and he made his anonymous acting d&eacute;but with Younger's provincial company in Southampton in July 1771. On 4 November that year he made his first appearance in London, at Covent Garden (in the title role of Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>) and was engaged for a further two seasons, during which he added considerably to his repertory of comic stage Irishmen, including Sir Lucius O'Trigger in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Major O'Flaherty in Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">The West Indian</span>, Teague in Robert Howard's <span class="italic">The Committee</span>, and Foigard in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>. Cumberland and Sheridan thanked Owenson for redeeming their creations from caricature.<br>
<br>On 15 December 1772 Owenson married Jane Hill (<i>d</i>. 1789). Jane's family were prosperous, evangelical Methodists from Shropshire (her father was at one time lord mayor of Shrewsbury); deeply opposed to the theatre, they were shocked by her marriage to an actor, but did not cut her off, and she was left a significant legacy by her father. The Owensons had four children, of whom two daughters survived infancy. They were the novelist Sydney [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19234/', "Morgan, Sydney, Lady Morgan")</script>] and Olivia, who married the physician Sir Arthur Clarke. Owenson left Covent Garden at the end of the 1773&#150;4 season and performed in 1774 with Samuel Foote's summer company at the Haymarket and in 1776 with Tate Wilkinson's company, where he was noticed by Dublin's Crow Street Theatre manager, Thomas Ryder, and offered a small share in that theatre and the post of deputy manager.<br>
<br>Owenson's twenty-year association with the Irish theatre began at Crow Street on 21 October 1776, when he appeared in his most famous role, Major O'Flaherty in <span class="italic">The West Indian</span>. A Dublin critic found his brogue &#145;characteristic, and not too vulgar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, 22 Oct 1776). Owenson quickly established himself as Crow Street's Irishman, playing a wide variety of Irish roles and singing Irish songs in the Irish language, both in Dublin and on his frequent visits to provincial theatres. He also became known for his comic monologues, such as &#145;Larry O'Shaughnessy's Tour thro' Dublin&#146; and &#145;The Black Cart, or, A Peep at Channel Row&#146;. In the next nine seasons he acted regularly in nearly a hundred roles, about half of which were Irish parts, and he became very popular, especially during the period after 1779 when the Irish Volunteers, to which Owenson belonged, constituted a significant part of Irish theatre audiences. Owenson was the only entertainer of any stature in his day to sing songs in the Irish language in the professional theatre. In addition to at least one prologue in Irish, Owenson is credited with writing a popular comic piece called <span class="italic">The Prelude</span> (1777), at least two songs, &#145;Rory O'More&#146; and &#145;Love's the Fairest Creature&#146;, and a long poem entitled &#145;Theatrical Fears&#146; (1804).<br>
<br>Owenson led a company of actors to Sligo and Galway in October 1782 and was so successful that, with the encouragement of the local gentry, he built a small but elegant new theatre in Kirwan's Lane, the first structure to be built in Galway specifically for theatrical performances. Whether his experiences in Galway ignited in him the desire to manage in Dublin, or whether he quarrelled with Daly, is not known with certainty, but on 20 December 1784 Owenson opened a rival new City Theatre in the refurbished playhouse in Fishamble Street. Lady Morgan's largely inaccurate account of the life of this theatre must be corrected. Owenson had long been associated with the nascent nationalist movement in Ireland, and, although this point is largely conjectural, he had almost certainly hoped to capitalize on these connections in his new venture. But Lady Morgan's claim that her father had founded the first Irish &#145;national&#146; theatre at Fishamble Street is not reflected in the repertory, which contained little that was original, or even particularly Irish. After a strong start the Fishamble Street theatre operated with increasing irregularity until early June 1785. There is, however, some evidence to support Lady Morgan's insinuation that the Fishamble Street venture was discouraged, if not suppressed, by the Irish government in order to grant a patent and theatrical monopoly to Daly.<br>
<br>By August 1785 Owenson was to be found again with Daly's Crow Street company, where he remained for the next ten seasons. During a part of the 1793&#150;4 season, and again in the following season, he was at Kilkenny at the head of a company, probably as Daly's deputy. He spent the summer of the 1796&#150;7 season at Crow Street and made a visit to Cork in October 1797. Thereafter he retired from the stage, and perhaps became the landlord of a Dublin public house. As early as the time of the closing of the Fishamble Street theatre he had taken up the importation of French wines as a sideline, and he met with considerable success in the business. His wife, Jane, died in late May or early June 1789 in Drumcondra. She had never deviated from her evangelical piety and opposition to the stage, nor had she settled easily into Irish society. Her daughter observed that she was forced to live in &#145;her penal settlement &hellip; hating both potatoes and papists with Christian inveteracy, and culinary prejudice&#146;  (Campbell, 22&#150;3).<br>
<br>Owenson came out of retirement briefly in 1807, when he acted the part of O'Driscoll several times in his daughter's comic opera <span class="italic">The First Attempt</span>. On 27 May 1807 at Crow Street he took what was almost certainly his farewell benefit. He died, at the age of sixty-eight, at the Dublin home of his younger daughter shortly before 28 May 1812, and was buried in the graveyard in Irishtown.<br>
