<span class="headword">Lethieullier, Sir  John</span>  (1632/3&#150;1719), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was the eldest of the three sons of Jane Delafort of London and Jan le Thieullier (1591&#150;1679), a French protestant from Valenciennes who was brought to England in 1605 and established himself first in Ilford, Essex, and later in Lewisham, Kent. John was to become one of the most distinguished and successful members of his large and prosperous family, and he occupies a significant place in that second generation of Huguenot families which, like his friends the Houblons, distinguished themselves in late seventeenth-century London trade and contributed notably to the &#145;financial revolution&#146; of the 1690s and beyond. Under the auspices of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company, of which he became master in 1676, he was apprenticed to alderman Sir John Frederick (1601&#150;1685), an eminent merchant who became lord mayor of London in 1661, and in 1658 he married Anne Hooker (<i>d</i>. 1702/3), the eldest daughter of a future lord mayor. Her plump, pretty looks were much admired by Samuel Pepys (a fellow parishioner of St Olave's, Hart Street) who also paid tribute to her husband as &#145;a pretty, civil, understanding merchant&#146;. Through his powerful connections Lethieullier was well placed to succeed in City government, and he also established himself quickly in London's overseas trade.<br>
<br>Lethieullier specialized initially in the export of English textiles to southern Europe and the Levant, buying extensively from East Anglian and west of England manufacturers and superintending the dyeing and finishing in partnership with his brother-in-law, Charles Marescoe, but his interests became increasingly diversified. In 1669, for example, he was importing sugar from Portugal and iron from the Netherlands while exporting lead and tin to Venice and Rotterdam. He became a member (and later director) of the Levant Company and by 1673 was also a director of the East India Company. At the same time he was involved with the Hamburg trade in English textiles and German linens carried on by the declining company of Merchant Adventurers, of which he became governor, and with the new Royal African Company of 1671, in which he served as a director after 1681.<br>
<br>Having served Tower ward as a common councilman from 1672 to 1675 and performed a term as a sheriff in 1674&#150;5, during which he was knighted, Lethieullier was chosen as alderman for Cripplegate ward but quickly secured his discharge without bearing the usual fine. Nevertheless, through his father-in-law and in his own right, he was an influential figure in City affairs, and he was able to intervene successfully to save his sister Leonora's second husband, Jacob David, from the full financial penalties of his frauds. The career of his brother Sir Christopher (1639&#150;1690) closely matched his own, since the latter traded within the Levant Company (of which he became a director), served as a sheriff in 1688&#150;9 (when he was knighted), and held his place as an alderman for Coleman Street ward before and after the revolution of 1688. His other brother, William (1646&#150;1728), also prospered as a merchant and served the City as a common councilman.<br>
<br>Lethieullier acquired several properties outside London, which proved their value in the years of the plague and fire. He retained his father's ties in Essex with a house at Low Leyton, and he followed him to Greenwich, where about 1680 he built a substantial mansion called Lewisham House. He also purchased Sutton Place at Sutton-at-Hone in Kent, while in London he acquired, among other properties, Buckingham House in College Street, the former mansion of the second duke, George Villiers.<br>
<br>Lethieullier did not retain close ties with the French protestant community from which he stemmed, but in 1681 he was appointed as trustee for a fund set up to support French refugees in linen manufacture at Ipswich. He also served his Hart Street parish as a trustee of its charities, and when he died, in his eighty-sixth year, at Lewisham House on 4 January 1719, was buried at St Alfege, Greenwich, where his churchyard monument, erected by a grandson, also records his two sons, John and William, and his three daughters, Anne, Letitia, and Leonora. In a very lengthy will of 6 May 1709, with several codicils, he distributed his real property between his sons and gave &pound;10,200 to his unmarried daughters, Letitia and Leonora, as well as &pound;1000 in addition to his marriage settlement for Anne, now Lady Dodwell. He also left sums of &pound;100 for the French church in Threadneedle Street, and for Christ's Hospital and St Thomas's Hospital.<br>
