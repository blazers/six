<span class="headword">&Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n,  Peadar</span> <span class="st"> [Peter O'Doirnin]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1769), <span class="occ">poet</span>, may have been born in Cashel, co. Tipperary, although almost nothing is known for certain about his biographical details. Some of his poems suggest, however, that he may have spent some time in that vicinity. What is certain is that he lived the greater part of his life in south Armagh and north Louth, part of an Irish-speaking area which also encompassed parts of counties Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, and Down. The region formed a linguistic unit in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and was a centre of intense literary activity in the Gaelic tradition of manuscript copying and poetic composition. It was here that many of the late new romances, including some in the Ulster cycle, were composed. &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n himself is thought to be &#145;author&#146; of the last recension of <span class="italic">T&aacute;in b&oacute; Cuailgne</span> compiled in the region in the early eighteenth century.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n's life and work have been the cause of much conjecture and not a little embroidery. In the mid-nineteenth century Nicholas Kearney (Niocl&aacute;s &Oacute; Cearnaigh) passed off a number of his own compositions as &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n's work and altered his biography to suit his own ideas and prejudices, rendering the facts of &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n's life difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain (Kearney's &#145;Memoir&#146; is published in full in S. de R&iacute;s, <span class="italic">Peadar &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n</span>, 1969). Kearney's poems are easily recognized by their style, redolent of the period's romantic nationalism and quite distinct from the voice of the &#145;Independent man&#146;, &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n's only extant poem in English, in which he outlines his philosophy clearly:<blockquote>
<div>For kings or their guards I care not a straw<br>
</div>
<div>No colour at all shall make me stand<br>
</div>
<div>To Dukes or to Lords or to Ladys at ball<br>
</div>
<div>I never will crawl with a cap in my hand.<br>
</div> (&Oacute; Buachalla, <span class="italic">Peadar &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n</span>, 12)</blockquote>This attitude is readily discernible in much of his other work in Irish, particularly in &#145;Gear&aacute;n U&iacute; Dhoirn&iacute;n&#146; and &#145;Mianta U&iacute; Dhoirn&iacute;n&#146;. Significantly, when most of his fellow poets in the region regarded the Catholic clergy as allies, his is a dissenting voice, satirizing one of them for his avarice in the mixed prose and verse <i>cros&aacute;ntacht</i>, &#145;An Cl&eacute;ireach B&aacute;n&#146;, thought to be about a certain Father Toirealach &Oacute; Cuinne of Creggan (An Creag&aacute;n), co. Armagh. He also satirized Muiris &Oacute; Gorm&aacute;in, one of the foremost scribes of the area, lampooning &Oacute; Gorm&aacute;in's poor command of English in an imagined conversation between &Oacute; Gorm&aacute;in and a young girl he met on the road to Drogheda. &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n did not continually lament for the glories of past days but wished for material ease and comfort in his present circumstances, something for which he would have readily exchanged his learning. He also celebrates the benefits and pleasures of whiskey drinking.<br>
<br>In his love songs, which form the greater part of his work, and which fall within the conventions of <i>amour courtois</i>, &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n was not above satirizing himself, sometimes portraying himself as an ardent, but sexually impotent, and consequently unsuccessful, wooer of women. In others, it is because of his lack of means that he is rejected. The picture that emerges from the work is of a significant talent, a man with a love of sensual pleasure, aware of the constraints placed upon him by the dominant, exclusionary, sectarian, Anglophone culture of the period. &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n died at Nurney (An Urna&iacute;), co. Louth, early in April 1769. He was buried near the north-east wall of the churchyard at An Urna&iacute;. His mellifluous love song &#145;&Uacute;rchnoc Ch&eacute;in Mhic C&aacute;inte&#146; was set again to music by Peadar &Oacute; Dubhda in 1907, and remains popular, particularly in Ulster. For the commemoration of his death in 1969, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riada set his &#145;Mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann&#146; to a new air which has been notably recorded by the English pop singer Kate Bush, among others.<br>
