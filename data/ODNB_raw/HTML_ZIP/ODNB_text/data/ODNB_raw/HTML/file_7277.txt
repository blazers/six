<span class="headword">Davis,  David</span>  (1745&#150;1827), <span class="occ">dissenting minister and poet</span>, was born on 14 February 1745 at Goetre-isaf, in the parish of Llangybi, near Lampeter, Cardiganshire, where his father, Timothy Jacob (1711/12&#150;1795), a farmer, and his wife, Elinor, were zealous members of the presbyterian church at Cilgwyn. David was the eldest of five brothers, all of whom subsequently adopted the surname of Davis. A manuscript once in the possession of Davis's eldest son, David, calls him Dafydd ab Ieuan Rhydderch, which was possibly his bardic style. His early religious impressions, as Davis acknowledged in one of his poems, were due to the influence of his pastor, Philip Pugh of Cilgwyn, a notable Independent preacher, in sympathy with the Methodist movement, who had been trained under Samuel Jones, one of the ejected presbyterians of 1662. Davis was accepted as a member at Cilgwyn in 1763.<br>
<br>Having passed through preparatory schools at Leominster (where he spent a year and a half with his uncle, Joshua Thomas, the Baptist historian), Llanybydder, and Llangeler, Davis was sent in 1763 to the grammar school at Carmarthen under Jenkin Jenkins. At the beginning of 1764 he was admitted as a divinity student on the foundation at the Carmarthen Academy, under Samuel Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1766). This institution, supported by the London Presbyterian Board, had been aided also by the London Congregational Board until 1755, when the theological teaching of Thomas began to be regarded as heterodox. Yet until Samuel Horsley became bishop of St David's (1788), not only dissenters of all classes but candidates for Anglican orders received their training in this academy. Under Thomas's successor (from 1765), Jenkin Jenkins, the academy was in high esteem for classical learning. Among Davis's contemporaries and lifelong friends were Archdeacon Thomas Beynon and Josiah Rees, editor of <span class="italic">Trysorfa Gwybodaeth</span>, the first Welsh periodical (1770), and father of Owen Rees, who became a partner in Longmans, the London publisher, in 1794.<br>
<br>After leaving the academy, Davis accepted (1 January 1769) a call to be co-pastor with David Lloyd (Dafydd Llwyd) at Llwynrhydowen, Cardiganshire, where he received presbyterian ordination on 15 July 1773. His stipend was very small and his duties were somewhat laborious, as he had to minister to four or five presbyterian churches of Arian and Unitarian tendencies at some distance from each other. He married on 15 November 1775 Anne Evans (1745/6&#150;1832) of Foelallt, daughter of John Evans, of Llysfaen, Llanwnnen, and they had five sons and four daughters. As a preacher in Welsh he was both powerful and very popular, having a fine voice and great command of his native language. He usually took a comprehensive view of his subject, but at times his sermons lacked preparation and he relied too much on his extemporary powers. He excelled in pathos, but this was sometimes taken to extremes. His great theme was the love of God to all his creatures.<br>
<br>In addition to his pastoral work Davis conducted a school at Castellhywel from 1783, and over a period of thirty years he became distinguished as one of the most successful schoolmasters and classical teachers in Wales. The school attracted pupils from all parts of Wales and beyond. Candidates for Anglican holy orders were educated here until about 1790, when Bishop Samuel Horsley declared that he would not ordain such candidates because of Davis's theological and political views. The managers of the Carmarthen Academy were desirous of securing him as tutor, but he declined their overtures. Lloyd died on 4 February 1779, and a few years later Richard Lloyd, his son, was for a short time colleague with Davis (until 1784). Subsequently Davis's second son, Timothy, was his colleague (1799&#150;1810).<br>
<br>When he began his ministry Davis had already departed from the theological views of his earlier years. The fact that he had become Arian in his theology appears in his friendly controversy with the Revd D. Saunders, a Calvinistic Baptist, of Merthyr Tudful. But he remained more conservative in his theology than most Arians and he retained a good deal of evangelical sentiment, the fruits of Philip Pugh's ministry, as is indicated by his Welsh translation of Henry Scougall's <span class="italic">God's Life in Man's Soul</span> (1779). As showing the latitudinarian tendencies of his time it is worth noting that, at the instance of Archdeacon Beynon, he began a Welsh translation of John Taylor's work on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>, but this was not completed. By 1801&#150;2 it was clear that he was not radical enough for some members of his congregations. The dissension led to the seceding of some eighty members, who established three Unitarian churches in the area.<br>
<br>In politics Davis was a radical and openly supported the French Revolution. He was friendly with Richard Price, Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg), John Jones of Glan-y-gors, Thomas Roberts of Llwyn'rhudol, and Thomas Evans (Tomos Glyn Cothi), all active propagandists in Wales and London, and he published a number of poems voicing his support for the ideals of the revolution. In 1791 he initiated resolutions of condolence offered to Joseph Priestley by the Cardiganshire dissenters after the Birmingham riots; but he never had any intellectual sympathy with thinkers of the Priestley school, and proposed the following epitaph in Welsh and English in response to his ideas of materialism and the mortality of the soul for their leader:<blockquote>
<div>Here lie at rest<br>
</div>
<div>In oaken chest,<br>
</div>
<div>Together packed most nicely,<br>
</div>
<div>The bones and brains,<br>
</div>
<div>Flesh, blood, and veins,<br>
</div>
<div>And soul of Dr. Priestley.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>This choice sample of Welsh humour was repeated by Price to Priestley, who is said to have been &#145;much pleased with it&#146;.<br>
<br>Davis's poems were collected and published by his son David as <span class="italic">Telyn Dewi</span> in 1824. The poems were warmly received and rather extravagantly praised by his contemporaries, so much so that Davis regretted that he had not paid more attention to his poetry writing. Some of the poems are occasional pieces, and his hymns are far removed in tone from the emotion of those of contemporary Methodist hymn writers. A number of poems celebrating the French Revolution, however, became popular, but his most common theme is the frailty of human life and the transience of mortal glory. He is best remembered for his free translation of Gray's &#145;Elegy in a Country Churchyard&#146; and for his classical <i>englynion</i> (strict metre quatrains); his poetic references to the ruins of nearby Peterwell House presage the later Romantics.<br>
<br>An engraving of Davis by Bond, from a painting by Harvey, presents a rather heavy countenance, with a forehead high but receding. He was of gentle and genial manners, though a strict disciplinarian at his school, fond of society and the idol of his circle, full of anecdote and sportive in conversation. He retired in 1820. He reached a mellow and venerable age, dying at Llwynrhydowen on 3 July 1827. He was buried on 7 July in the churchyard of Llanwenog, Cardiganshire, where a monument with an inscription in Welsh was erected to his memory. His widow died in 1832 aged eighty-six. Three of his sons entered the ministry; his second son, Timothy, the translator into Welsh of a portion of the commentary of Thomas Coke, died at Evesham, Worcestershire, on 28 November 1860, aged eighty.<br>
