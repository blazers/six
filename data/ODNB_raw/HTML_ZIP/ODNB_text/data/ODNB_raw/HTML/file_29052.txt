<span class="headword">Wentworth, Sir  Peter</span>  (1592&#150;1675), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Nicholas Wentworth of Lillingstone Lovell, Oxfordshire (later Buckinghamshire), and his wife, Susanna, daughter of Roger Wigston of Wolston, Warwickshire. He was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29051/', "Peter Wentworth (1524&#150;1597)")</script>, the vociferous champion of free speech in the Elizabethan parliaments. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1610 and became a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1613. He was made a knight of the Bath at Charles I's coronation and served as a JP in Oxfordshire. As sheriff in 1634&#150;5 he experienced difficulties with the collection of ship money, which led to his being questioned before the privy council. He is the probable author of <span class="italic">A pack of puritans, mayntaining the unlawfulness, or inexpediencie or both of pluralities and nonresidency &hellip; as also a defence of the authority of princes and parliaments to intermeddle with matters of religion</span> (1641). He was listed as having refused the king's summons to fight against the Scots in the first bishops' war and was elected to the Long Parliament for Tamworth, Staffordshire, in December 1641. He subscribed &pound;100 and three horses for the defence of the realm in June 1642, and signed the solemn league and covenant in September 1643.<br>
<br>Though evidence is sparse for Wentworth's wartime parliamentary activity, he was among the more radical of MPs. As such the &#145;presbyterians&#146; accused him of self-interested, arbitrary abuse of committees, ordinances, and county influence. Denzil Holles called him one of the &#145;small Prophets&#146; and attacked him over his involvement in the disputed manor of Wolston. Wentworth's father had purchased Perrie Mill on the estate in 1605, and George Warner of Wolston purchased the majority of the manor in 1612: Warner's failure to compound as a royalist within the three-month period of grace allowed under the conditions given at the surrender of Lichfield saw Wentworth able to purchase Wolston, valued at &pound;6000, for &pound;2038. Warner complained of obstruction from Wentworth, who was aided by the Somerset MP John Ashe, who later chaired the Commonwealth compounding committee. Wentworth was added to the committee on 9 April 1649, and was a trustee for the maintenance of ministers, by which he benefited from the estate of Richard Chamberlain of Temple House and Astley, Warwickshire, and Buriton, Hampshire.<br>
<br>In September 1647 Wentworth joined Henry Marten as teller against a motion to make a further application to the king for a settlement, indicating membership of the minority group willing to settle the kingdom without the king. He was named to the high court of justice to try Charles I, but pleaded that a series of falls and subsequent ill health kept him at home. Although he may have been avoiding controversy, his subsequent Commonwealth career also displays erratic attendance. He was named to the second, fourth, and fifth councils of state, combining long, unbroken stretches in attendance&#151;when he invariably arrived early&#151;with similar periods of total absence. His friendships were typical of a committed republican. He combined an intimacy with John Milton, to whom he would bequeath &pound;100 (referring to Milton's writing against the French monarchist Salmasius), with fellowship with Henry Marten. Marten and Wentworth were named during Cromwell's speech dismissing the Rump on 20 April 1653 for having disgraced the parliamentary process, resorting to alehouses and stews. Wentworth retorted that Cromwell's language to parliament was &#145;unbecoming&#146;, but his &#145;prating&#146; was silenced  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 1.352&#150;3).<br>
<br>Wentworth withdrew from London during the protectorate but acted against Cromwell in the localities. His prosecution of a tax collector in Warwickshire, following the dissolution of the first protectorate parliament, brought him before the council. He claimed a constant commitment to the principle that &#145;no money ought to be levied upon the people without their consent in parliament&#146;, but then submitted to Cromwell and withdrew his suit, justifying himself to Ludlow that his age and infirmity had sapped his will to fight  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 1.413&#150;4). With the fall of the protectorate he took his seat in the restored Rump, and again sat on the council of state. When the army dismissed the Rump for the second time, in 1659, he managed to break back into the Commons chamber from the Thames-side. The council of state assigned him Whitehall lodgings in January 1660, and he continued to sit when the Long Parliament was briefly reconstituted in February 1660. Having withdrawn from politics at the Restoration he died, unmarried, on 1 December 1675, and was buried in the church at Lillingstone Lovell. His Warwickshire property descended through his grandnephew, Fisher Dilke, on condition that he take the name of Wentworth.<br>
