<span class="headword">Boutell,  Charles</span>  (1812&#150;1877), <span class="occ">writer on heraldry and antiquities</span>, was born on 1 August 1812 at Pulham St Mary, Norfolk, the son of the Revd Charles Boutell (1771&#150;1855), perpetual curate of Repps-with-Bastwick, Norfolk (1808&#150;48), and his wife, Mary Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Day). He entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1829 and graduated BA in 1834. In 1836 he was incorporated at Trinity College, Oxford, took his MA degree, and the same year was ordained as deacon at Ely. He was briefly curate at Hemsby, Norfolk, and then curate at St Leonards, Sandridge, Hertfordshire (1837&#150;46), where he took priest's orders in 1839. In 1847 he returned to Norfolk as rector of Downham Market (1847&#150;50) and vicar of St Mary Magdalen, Wiggenshall (1847&#150;55), before becoming (<i>c</i>.1851) curate at Litcham to assist his aged father, who was the incumbent. After moving to London in 1855 he held various positions, including reader at St Luke's, Lower Norwood (1860&#150;67). On 17 April 1838 Boutell married Mary, daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5255/', "Revd Dr John Chevallier")</script> of Aspall Hall, Suffolk, and his first wife, Caroline. They had four sons, two of whom died young, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Boutell wrote extensively on architecture, brasses, and heraldry. In 1845 he was a founder member and joint secretary of the St Albans Architectural Society; he also acted as the society's treasurer, but was far from reliable. The following year he contributed the text of Britton's <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Early Domestic Architecture of England</span>. His next work was <span class="italic">Monumental Brasses and Slabs</span> (1847), &#145;still an important pioneering work&#146;  (Busby, 1996, 10), which was followed two years later by <span class="italic">Monumental Brasses of England</span>. In 1855, after moving to London, Boutell became a founder member of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society; on 23 July 1857 he was appointed secretary (against the advice of the Revd Thomas Hugo, a principal trustee). Four months later, on 27 November, at a special meeting, he was dismissed and required to repay the sum of &pound;56 15<i>s</i>. This was not his first or his last financial embarrassment, but his antiquarian zeal appears to have been unimpaired, and <span class="italic">A Manual of British Archaeology</span> was published in 1858, with illustrations by Orlando Jewitt. <span class="italic">A Manual of Heraldry, Historical and Popular</span> was an immediate success in 1863 and a second edition was called for in two months, and published as <span class="italic">Heraldry, Historical and Popular</span>; further editions followed in 1864 and 1867. <span class="italic">Boutell's Heraldry</span>, as it became known, was his most popular and enduring work, and revised editions were published at intervals up to 1983. In 1891 John Evans praised Boutell &#145;for popularising heraldry&#146;  (Levine, 91). Boutell helped Mary, his elder daughter, to publish <span class="italic">Picture Natural History, Including Zoology, Fossils, and Botany</span> (1869) while completing <span class="italic">Arms and Armour in Antiquity and in the Middle Ages</span>, his translation of J. P. Lacombe.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1866) Boutell wrote a series of articles on &#145;Our early national portraits&#146;; he also contributed to the journals of the British Archaeological Association and the Archaeological Institute, and to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. The Robinson Library, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, houses a series of his manuscript notebooks (1865&#150;71), and the British Library has two notebooks on misericords (1872; Add. MSS 32135&#150;32136).<br>
<br>After two years of declining health Boutell died of a ruptured heart on 31 July 1877 at 18 Portsdown Road, London; he was buried on 4 August at Paddington old cemetery, Kilburn. His wife died in 1885. His life was described as &#145;one of continuous trouble&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), but while this may describe his personal life his public persona was different. His financial embarrassments included being &#145;a prisoner for debt&#146; in 1868  (Busby, 1999, 13); his bankruptcy was announced in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 23 December that year, when he was described as &#145;late of Jermyn Street&#146;. None of this did anything to reduce his considerable popularity as a lecturer or his reputation as an antiquary. He was clearly personable; the obituary in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> states, &#145;His varied information &hellip; always conveyed with great fluency of speech and clearness of description &hellip; and his most courteous manners, rendered him at all times a very agreeable companion&#146;  (Busby, 1999, 14).<br>
