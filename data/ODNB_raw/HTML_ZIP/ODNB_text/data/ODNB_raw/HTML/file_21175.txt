<span class="headword">Palmer, Sir  Arthur Hunter</span>  (1819&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician and pastoralist in Australia</span>, was born on 28 December 1819 in Armagh, Ireland, the elder son of Lieutenant Arthur Palmer RN (<i>d</i>. 1836), and his second wife, Emily (1797&#150;1826), the daughter of Robert Hunter of Dublin and Downpatrick. He was educated at Youghal grammar school and by private tutor in Dublin. In 1838 he sailed in the <i>City of Edinburgh</i> for Sydney, Australia, and, after a pastoral apprenticeship in the Illawarra district, in 1840 he became manager of the properties of Henry Dangar. He expanded the latter's interests and became general manager in 1856.<br>
<br>Backed by savings and experience, Palmer was ready to become a squatter in his own right. Queensland was opening up to European settlement, having in 1859 become a self-governing colony. In 1863 Palmer leased Beaufort run; later he acquired Cambridge Downs and shared ownership of Gin Gin station with the McIlwraith brothers. Through the 1890s he relinquished these interests, partly through resumptions, but especially because of foreclosures. On 8 June 1865 he married Cecilia Jessie (<i>d</i>. 31 Aug 1885), the daughter of Archibald Mosman, a merchant and pastoralist. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Palmer's interest in political and civic matters began in 1865 when, in squatter tradition, he acted as magistrate. The next year he was elected to the legislative assembly as member for Port Curtis, and in 1867&#150;8 he was colonial secretary and secretary for public works in the &#145;Pure Merino&#146; administration of Robert Mackenzie. His political interests were mainly pastoral and regional.<br>
<br>In 1870 Palmer was surprised to be asked by Governor Blackall to form an administration, and in April that year, taking the offices of colonial secretary and premier, he put together a cohesive ministry. With colonial finances shaky, he initially pursued retrenchment and consolidation. By 1872, however, despite his squatter background, he was often proving as liberal as his opponents, and embarking upon progressive policies, notably manhood suffrage after six months' residence and single-member electorates. Palmer's political interests were broadening, and he sought to govern in the interests of all sectors and parts of the colony. In 1873, while premier, he introduced a private bill on state education, propounding the principles of free (through to university), compulsory, and secular education, with state funding going only to state schools. Thereby he lost the support of most conservatives, and he failed to regain the premiership after the subsequent election.<br>
<br>Palmer's political principles were described by a contemporary as those of &#145;a radical of the Old Cobbett school&#146;  (W. Coote). Between 1874 and 1878 Palmer led the opposition, but his role as conservative leader was increasingly being assumed by Thomas McIlwraith. Palmer was elected for North Brisbane in 1878, and served in McIlwraith's ministry as colonial secretary and secretary for public instruction (1879&#150;81). Appointed KCMG in 1881, he transferred to the legislative council that year and became president; twice he was administrator in the absence of the governor, and in 1893 he was appointed the first lieutenant-governor of Queensland. He was again acting governor in 1895&#150;6.<br>
<br>The interests of Palmer and McIlwraith were intermeshed&#151;through marriage, when McIlwraith married Palmer's wife's sister in 1879, and through land-holding and financial matters. In 1879 McIlwraith transferred his directorship of the Queensland National Bank to Palmer. Both were also involved in two land finance companies. This association implicated Palmer in financial scandals in the 1880s and 1890s, but he was cleared of any impropriety. Nevertheless, the financial collapse that settled upon Queensland (and the Queensland National Bank) in the early 1890s took its toll on him.<br>
<br>Palmer appeared to his contemporaries as bluff, brusque, arrogant&#151;&#145;the great Mogul&#146;; often the bully, he displayed a violent temper. Seen as a capable administrator, he behaved as the tory patrician. He died at his home, Easton Gray, Toowong, Brisbane, on 20 March 1898, and was buried quietly in the Toowong cemetery on the following day.<br>
