<span class="headword">Cameron,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Hawkie]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1787&#150;1851), <span class="occ">pedlar and beggar</span>, was probably born at St Ninians, Stirlingshire, the son of Dugald Cameron of Braemar, a mashman, and his wife, Janet Paterson. As members of the Burgher Secession church the family barely feature in parochial registers, so details of Cameron's early life are mostly drawn from his autobiography. He was crippled at the age of six, and his parents destined him for a sedentary career as a tailor. He liked neither the work nor his master, and ran away on several occasions. His final break from home came when he joined a group of travelling players. When they disbanded he followed several itinerant careers, including preacher, china mender, and fortune-teller, before becoming a pedlar of songs and a beggar. To Cameron there was little distinction between selling a ballad and outright begging: &#145;to <i>sing</i> on the streets requires a person who is a stranger to shame&#146;  (Cameron, 36). His wares were often worthless, mere scraps of paper. He would invent the story they were supposed to relate. It was his improvised sales patter that people paid to hear.<br>
<br>According to his autobiography Cameron had travelled through most parts of Scotland and northern England, but his name is principally associated with Glasgow. It was there, in 1818, that he learnt his trade as a &#145;speech-caller&#146; from Jamie &#145;Blue&#146; McIndoe, another well-known street wit. The two were friends and partners for some time, before becoming rivals. In the 1820s Cameron travelled to fairs outside Glasgow, though he avoided his home area of Stirling, and was well known in Edinburgh to judge by the sheets he had prepared for him there by the printer Robert Menzies. His usual beat, however, was the Trongate and High Street areas of Glasgow, not far from the print shops and singing saloons of the Saltmarket that supplied him with his wares and his market, nor from the lodging houses and spirit shops of the Briggate slum, where he resided. He was, by his own admission and the testimony of everyone who knew him, an inveterate drunkard.<br>
<br>Cameron occupied the lowest rung of the publishing industry. For a penny he would buy a dozen sheets from a Saltmarket printer, such as Thomas Duncan, which he sold for a halfpenny each. With this new capital he returned to the print shop, an operation he could repeat several times on a good Saturday night (pay-day). He also did well at executions, where he sold &#145;last speeches&#146; of the condemned. Sometimes he had printers make up booklets of his own compositions, or adapted existing titles by other street writers, in this way hoping to have the monopoly of them. He got his nickname from one such sheet, a parody delivered in the voice of a cow (&#145;hawkie&#146; in Scots) of the Glasgow weaver and prophet David Ross. Street literature is ephemeral, but a few titles &#145;printed for William Cameron&#146; survive in the National Library of Scotland and in Glasgow University Library.<br>
<br>Cameron was also approached by groups to make up songs to promote their particular cause, as he did for the masons and plasterers of Edinburgh when they were in dispute with their masters in 1826&#150;7. The vibrant social and political life of urban Scotland in these years encouraged an outpouring of poetry for use by various clubs and causes. Cameron's loyalties lay with political reformers and Chartists. According to a song published by the printer and retailer the Poet's Box, Glasgow,<blockquote>
<div>He's fond o' the Whigs, and aye praises their creed<br>
</div>
<div>But aye sends the Tories to hell at full speed.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He was patronized by whig politicians and publishers like Peter MacKenzie, editor of the <span class="italic">Reformer's Gazette</span>. His speciality, however, was comic pieces, particularly those aimed at women, such as the pedlar&#150;poet Alexander Wilson's &#145;Watty and Meg&#146;. He was also known for his verbal assaults on Roman Catholicism and Irish immigrants, although the latter were his neighbours and companions on the road and in Glasgow's lodging-houses. His reflections on the &#145;Irish question&#146; in his autobiography  (pp. 31&#150;2) were more temperate.<br>
<br>Cameron wrote his <span class="italic">Autobiography of a Gangrel</span> for his friend and patron the publisher David Robertson, probably as a way of earning some money (popular autobiographies in this period were often a form of disguised charity), but it was not published until 1888, after both their deaths. It mostly covers his travelling years and draws on the established chapbook genre of an expos&eacute; of beggars' tricks. It also describes his temporary marriages to several other itinerants, but he had no known official spouse or offspring. From 1838 he took up winter residence in the Glasgow Town Hospital, where he died on 11 September 1851. He was buried in the city's Sighthill cemetery on 13 September.<br>
<br>Cameron's wit was celebrated in his own lifetime both in street literature and in Robertson's comic collections <span class="italic">Whistle-Binkie</span> and <span class="italic">The Laird of Logan</span>. William Gemmell, the self-taught sculptor and blacksmith of Eaglesham, made a statue of him, now at the Statue House, Eaglesham Museum. Anecdotes based on his repartee, some certainly apocryphal, fill Glasgow memoirs of the nineteenth century. It was his ability verbally to best figures of authority that was especially appreciated, although Cameron put his cheek down to drink. To give just one story, though it has many variants, during Queen Victoria's visit in 1849 Cameron was asked to guess the height of a triumphal arch at the foot of Jamaica Street; he replied &#145;The heicht o' hanged nonsense&#146;  (Ford, 363).<br>
