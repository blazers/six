<span class="headword">Barclay, Sir  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1636&#150;1710), <span class="occ">army officer and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was probably born in Kincardineshire, the son of Andrew Barclay of &#145;Sheels&#146;, who was of an unrecorded cadet branch of the Barclay family of Johnston, Kincardineshire, and was perhaps Andrew, a younger son of John Barclay MP (<i>fl</i>. 1619&#150;1671). The Johnston branch in turn were cadets of the Barclays of Mathers and Urie, who produced Robert Barclay, principal of the Scots College, Paris, and his nephew Robert Barclay the Quaker. Yet a government propagandist mentioned in 1696 &#145;the Obscurity of Sir <i>George</i>'s Character, that he hath no great Interest in his own Country, and is not much known in <i>England</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Observations</span>, 7). A proclamation of 1696 described him as aged about sixty. He had a sister, Anne, who survived him. He perhaps originally adopted Catholicism for a military career in foreign service. He wrote in 1688 to a secretary of state mentioning his battlefield experience and his zeal, known to James II, in the worst of times&#151;meaning the Popish Plot, when he, already a captain, received &pound;40 English royal bounty in early 1681 and &pound;50 in 1682. Barclay's first recorded British commissions were issued on 2 May 1685: to command a fort to be built on Stirling Bridge (never completed), and as inspector of the Scottish army. On 28 November 1685 he became major of the new English infantry regiment of his fellow Catholic Sir Edward Hales (afterwards the 14th foot), and on 3 October 1686 its lieutenant-colonel; he commanded it until the revolution. He acquired west highland contacts through Robert Barclay. He was knighted between 3 July 1687 and 6 November 1688. He was bequeathed the interest on &pound;2000 sterling by an otherwise unrecorded first wife. In 1687 he secretly married in London Anne (<i>c</i>. 1648&#150;1729), daughter and co-heir of Robert Caesar of Willian, Hertfordshire, and widow of Sir John Poyntz of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire. In January 1689, when he, like other Jacobites, wished to follow James to France, he was seriously ill in London. He was allowed to remain there by William of Orange, who then gave him a pass to go to France. On 13 February he made a hasty will to protect his wife if he was forfeited for treason.<br>
<br>Barclay was with James in Ireland in 1689, but in early July that year he crossed with Brigadier-General Cannon and other officers to Mull to join Viscount Dundee (John Graham of Claverhouse) and the Jacobite highland rising, carrying a commission for a proposed dragoon regiment. At Killiecrankie on 27 July he helped command Sir Donald Macdonald of Sleat's clan regiment on the left flank&#151;he was one of the few professional soldiers whom the highlanders admired. In September 1689 he was badly wounded and captured by raiding Williamites at Alexander Robertson of Struan's house in Atholl, but was exchanged that winter. In February 1690 he carried a letter from the clan chiefs to James in Ireland, asking the king to send his illegitimate son James Fitzjames, duke of Berwick, to command them. Barclay returned with money for the clans and was promoted brigadier-general in July 1690. That autumn he stayed with Macdonell of Glengarry and encouraged him to continue resistance.<br>
<br>By June 1691, however, Barclay, now a major-general, was convinced that the clans, lacking French help, could no longer hold out. He persuaded the hesitant Jacobite commander, Major-General Thomas Buchan, to enter into negotiations at Achallader with John Campbell, earl of Breadalbane, who acted as William's representative in the highlands. Barclay was chosen and then replaced as a messenger to ask James's permission for the clans to submit, but finally left on that mission in September, when no reply had been received. Without his support, Buchan was increasingly influenced by those opposed to the settlement, which virtually collapsed in November. That month Barclay finally joined Breadalbane's agent Duncan Menzies at St Germain. After a proposed French invasion of Scotland came to nothing, they persuaded James to sign a warrant releasing the clans on 12 December 1691 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> (2 December 1691 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>). A Dunkirk privateer would take them to Scotland; but they did not yet realize that William's revised deadline for the chiefs' submission, 1 January 1692, was in deadly earnest. They were captured off Dover on 12 December 1691 <span class="smallcap">OS</span> and taken to London. Barclay, on refusing to take the oaths to William, was prevented from carrying his news north. Menzies was allowed to do so on 15 December, and reached Edinburgh within a week; but snow delayed its dissemination among the clans. The chiefs rushed to submit in late December mainly because a winter campaign was imminent, not on account of James's permission; but had the messengers not been detained, the particular delay which prevented Alexander Macdonald of Glencoe from taking the oaths on time, and so led to the massacre of Glencoe, might not have occurred. Barclay felt sympathy for the clans; it is unknown whether the massacre affected his attitude to William.<br>
<br>Barclay was allowed to return to France in February 1692, and was involved in the Scottish side of the French invasion attempt that May. In 1692 he was appointed lieutenant of the second troop of James's guards. On 28 September 1693 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> he transferred to the first troop, of which Berwick was captain. During the summer they often served with the French army. In December 1693 Barclay and a Captain Francis Williamson were in England to obtain for the Jacobite secretary of state, John Drummond, earl of Melfort, opinions from various leading Jacobites that James should invade swiftly with a French army 30,000 strong. They carried back several propositions from lesser men for kidnapping William, which were disregarded.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1695&#150;6 James at last prepared to lead a small French invasion. According to Berwick, who was in overall charge of the rising intended to support it, Barclay was appointed second-in-command to Sir John Fenwick in the leadership of 2000 Jacobite cavalry expected to assemble in London and the south-east. In November 1695 James instructed Barclay to cross secretly to London and organize the rising in conjunction with the leading Jacobites involved. Officers and troopers of James's guards would follow, and he should appoint them to stiffen the raw regiments in the rising. James's secretary of state, John Caryll, had Barclay paid &pound;800 to buy horses for them. His commission, issued on 27 December 1695 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, the day he set off, authorized James's subjects to rise and make war on William, and particularly to seize strongholds in England. To cover Barclay's absence from St Germain, he was rumoured to be undergoing a pox cure at Paris. For security reasons, the guardsmen who followed him over in pairs were simply told to receive their orders from him. He reached London about 27 December <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, but was almost recalled at once over a problem of seniority as a general&#151;a confirmation that his mission was genuinely for the rising.<br>
<br>Barclay lived in London in disguise. His normal appearance was described in 1696 as tall, thin, hook-nosed, and ruddy-faced, with a crippled right hand. He changed lodgings several times, and secretly met and paid the Jacobite guardsmen who followed him in the piazza of Covent Garden. According to Barclay, Robert Charnock and Sir William Parkyns, both particularly active in preparing a rising, were the first to suggest to him an attack to assassinate William as a way of improving the invasion's chances. He responded eagerly, and showed Parkyns, a lawyer, his commission, probably to confirm that it could be interpreted as covering such attacks. Evidence of how unready most south-eastern Jacobites were to rise before the French landed, noted also by Berwick, evidently confirmed his determination, since he apparently never approached Fenwick. While keeping William's movements under observation, he received suggestions from various Jacobites of possible methods and places, besides alternative operations such as seizing the Tower. Barclay showed as much caution as such a plot allowed. He opposed, for instance, trusting George Porter, who, after capture, was to become the most damaging crown witness. Finally the conspirators, after several conferences, agreed to ambush William at Turnham Green as he returned from Saturday hunting at Richmond, with forty horsemen. Barclay with eight men would attack the king's coach and kill everyone inside, while the remainder in two parties fought the accompanying lifeguards. Barclay obtained nearly half the number of horsemen, ironically, from the officers and men of James's own lifeguards who had crossed. Several followed orders reluctantly, assuming that this was the mission for which James had told them to obey him, under a commission which, the leading conspirators claimed, specifically authorized it. There were no plans for securing the conspirators' safety afterwards, merely Barclay's assurance that James would land very soon. Berwick did not veto the scheme, under its thin cover of a kidnapping, but retired to France to avoid involvement.<br>
<br>Saturday 15 February was the day intended. Barclay gathered the guardsmen &#145;and declared, that these were his janissaries, and that he hoped they would bring him the garter&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 12.1326). However, the plot had been betrayed by two conspirators whom Barclay never met and one double agent whom he had kept from full knowledge, and William stayed at home. As no alarm was given, a further attempt was planned for 22 February, when the participants reassembled. This time, when William's preparations to hunt were cancelled, rumours of a plot spread, and the would-be assassins dispersed for good. A proclamation offered &pound;1000 for Barclay's capture. The exposure of the plot and of James's apparent responsibility temporarily crushed Jacobitism, and strengthened William's government politically when economic factors were bringing it near total collapse. The executed plotters included Ambrose Rookwood, an officer in James's guards, and several others were imprisoned without trial for life by parliament's authority: obeying a military superior's orders was not accepted as justification.<br>
<br>Both the government ministers and his fellow Jacobites, misled by his false trails, assumed that Barclay had instantly fled back to France when the plot was exposed. In fact he remained in hiding in London, and by late March had organized regular payments to his imprisoned subordinates, which were exposed in late May. His wife or her relatives perhaps helped shelter him. According to his son Alexander, he remained in England until September. There were later false sightings and alarms. It was only in July 1697 that he was authorized to revisit St Germain. On 4 August 1697 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> he completed at Paris a short account of his mission. The delay in his return apparently cooled any anger over his actions.<br>
<br>When Hans Willem Bentinck, first earl of Portland, entered Paris as ambassador in February 1698, he protested at finding Barclay and other would-be assassins appearing freely there and at St Germain. Louis XIV replied that Barclay had recently been paid off when his company was disbanded, and he did not know his whereabouts. Presumably to avoid further complaints and suspicions, he was afterwards sent to reside, receiving a French pension, at Bourges in Berry. He died at Issoudun in Berry on 31 July 1710 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, and the French government seized his papers. That perhaps provoked the ludicrous rumour that he had been &#145;the Man in the Iron Mask&#146;. Despite having sent money to his wife, Barclay had saved 43,000 livres, laid out in <i>rentes</i> on the Paris H&ocirc;tel de Ville. By his will of 15 June 1704 he left these to his wife for life, and afterwards 300 livres a year to the Scots College, Paris, where he desired his heart to be buried, to educate priests for the Scottish mission. Most of the residue was to support the main Barclay of Johnston family, now impoverished and crypto-Catholic. His widow, though already rich, frustrated his intentions, successfully claiming in lawsuits in France that the 1689 will, leaving her as sole legatee, remained uncancelled and that the 1704 will was merely a codicil. It is doubtful whether the Scots College received its bequests, and the Barclays had to sell Johnston in 1762.<br>
<br>Barclay's will did not mention any children, but his &#145;eldest&#146;  (Cole, 225) illegitimate son Alexander Barclay was interrogated in London in 1705 aged twenty-seven. Born in Britain, he studied at the Scots College and afterwards trained as a chemist and surgeon. He accompanied Barclay on a mission of 1695&#150;6 and undertook a Jacobite mission to England in 1700. An Alexander Barclay, an East India Company ship's surgeon since 1711 with a doctor brother named George, died on a trading voyage of 1731&#150;4 to China.<br>
