<span class="headword">Durant,  Henry William</span>  (1902&#150;1982), <span class="occ">opinion pollster and market researcher</span>, was born at 42 Drummond Road, Bermondsey, London, on 23 October 1902, the first son and second of the five children of Henry William Durant (1870&#150;1913), general warehouseman and later a foreman in a grain mill, and his wife, Adelaide, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Britt (1873&#150;1940), an office cleaner. His father died of pneumonia in 1913, leaving his wife to provide for their four surviving children and three female cousins. He attended Keeton's Road elementary school, Bermondsey, from 1904 until 1914, when he left to take up a London county council scholarship at Christ's Hospital, Horsham. Although he lost his south London accent during his time at Christ's Hospital, he felt permanently marked out as a &#145;charity case&#146; after receiving a secondhand uniform from the school matron on his arrival.<br>
<br>In 1919 Durant left school to work as an insurance clerk, studying for the Chartered Insurance Institute examinations while he worked, being elected an associate in 1926 and a fellow in 1930. Although insurance offered a well-paid job with good prospects, he found the life of an insurance clerk unsatisfying. Seeking intellectual stimulation, he attended an evening class in philosophy at the Morley Memorial College for Working Men and Women, where he impressed the course teacher, Cyril Joad. Encouraged by Joad, he took a course in economics at Regent Street Polytechnic taught by Hugh Beales, and in 1929 was accepted onto the undergraduate programme at the London School of Economics (LSE), attending lectures in the evening while continuing to work. Family responsibilities no longer held him back as his sisters and cousins were by then financially independent, and his studies were supported by scholarships, so he decided to quit his job in insurance to study full-time.<br>
<br>Durant threw himself into his academic studies with great success, taking a first-class degree in sociology in 1934, and receiving the L. T. Hobhouse memorial prize. The sociologist Morris Ginsberg persuaded him to register for the degree of PhD, which he combined with adult education teaching. He seemed set for a career in academic sociology, but found doctoral research stifling. He nevertheless completed his research and wrote his PhD thesis in under a year, and it was published as <span class="italic">The Problem of Leisure</span> in 1938. The social and political interests that motivated his studies began to pull him away from academe. He studied the works of Marx, Engels, Trotsky, and Bukharin, wrote for the LSE student paper <span class="italic">The Clare Market Review</span>, and became involved in the British National Committee for Intellectual Co-operation, part of the League of Nations' Organization for Intellectual Co-operation. His political activities brought him into contact with the sociologist Ruth Adele Lazarus (1912&#150;1990) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39973/', "Glass, Ruth")</script>], whom he married on 12 August 1935.<br>
<br>Durant's feeling that he should be the main breadwinner again led him to look for a well-paid job. Harry Field (1897&#150;1946), an emissary from the pioneering American opinion pollster George H. Gallup, had contacted the LSE appointments bureau seeking a bright graduate who might be interested in setting up a British affiliate to Gallup's American Institute of Public Opinion. Of the six students recommended by the bureau, Field chose Durant.<br>
<br>With Field's help Durant set up the British Institute of Public Opinion (BIPO). The new firm stuck closely to Gallup's original business model and methods. Durant offered to conduct postal surveys for newspapers and magazines such as <span class="italic">Cavalcade</span>. Although <span class="italic">Cavalcade</span> and his other clients paid handsomely for these surveys, they did not provide BIPO with a regular income. The firm's finances and future prospects remained precarious until Durant struck a deal with the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. Early in 1938 the newspaper's chairman, Lord Layton, intrigued by Gallup's polling methods, asked Durant to produce a private forecast of the outcome of the forthcoming West Fulham by-election. Durant predicted successfully that the Labour candidate Edith Summerskill would take West Fulham from the Conservatives. Impressed by the poll's accuracy and aware of their use to enliven news coverage in the American press, the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> commissioned regular BIPO polls on a variety of topics, publishing the results in the paper. The relationship with the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> publicized BIPO's work and helped Durant to find new clients including the head of the BBC's new listener research department, Robert Silvey (1905&#150;1981).<br>
<br>The Second World War offered Durant's business new opportunities for growth. The British government placed great importance on maintaining civilian morale and needed to find ways to measure it. Durant's first contribution in this area was to monitor German radio propaganda for the BBC. Periodic surveys revealed that a majority of civilians listened to foreign radio stations during the &#145;phoney war&#146; period, many of whom tuned in to German stations. Lord Haw-Haw, Sinister Sam, and the other German radio announcers were at their most effective when reporting news embargoed by the British government. These findings prompted the BBC and the Ministry of Information to change news policy. BIPO also conducted opinion polls for the Ministry of Information to monitor civilian morale and to test public attitudes towards new policies. Durant began to realize Gallup's and Field's vision of the poll as a way to keep governments in touch with the governed. He had one other large wartime job: weighing housewives and employees in small- and medium-sized businesses for the Ministry of Food. These data formed part of the bodyweight survey and showed that rationing caused no loss of weight until 1947.<br>
<br>Durant's marriage to Ruth Lazarus ended in divorce in 1941 after she left him for the sociologist David Glass. Durant took a room at Cyril Joad's house where he met his second wife, Margaret Dorothea (<i>b</i>. 1917), a laboratory technician and complaints manager, daughter of Franks Collens, meat control clerk; she was married to the medical librarian Harold Alfred Izant. After she was divorced she married Durant on 9 October 1945. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>Although official work sustained Durant during the war, it was a temporary source of income. The Ministry of Information ceased to monitor morale in 1944. Government departments and the BBC conducted an increasing amount of survey work using in-house organizations. For Durant demobilization meant market research. Durant's patron George Gallup came to his rescue, pushing commercial work his way. Towards the end of 1944 the advertising agency Young and Rubicam opened a London office. At the time Gallup was the agency's research director and recommended that the company hire Durant to conduct market research in the UK. This contract and work for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> provided a solid basis for Durant's commercial operations. Durant targeted a few more clients, securing contracts with the advertising agents S. H. Benson, Ford Motor Company, British Petroleum, Philips electronics, and the British Travel Association. These six clients accounted for 70 per cent of the firm's work. The questions from smaller firms included in Durant's monthly omnibus survey accounted for the remaining 30 per cent. Durant had found a successful strategy that sustained Social Surveys, the firm's name from 1943.<br>
<br>Market research secured the firm's future, but political polling, the historic core of the company's business, remained Durant's first love and the area in which he made his most significant contribution to British life. With the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>'s financial backing, Durant introduced political opinion polling to Britain. Politicians paid little heed to his polls until after the general election of 1945. This was Durant's first opportunity to predict the outcome of a general election since setting up BIPO in 1937 and he got it right. The Gallup poll, conducted between 24 and 27 June, predicted a Labour lead of 6 per cent. Labour topped the poll on 5 July with a lead of 9.5 per cent. The Gallup poll share of each party fell within the range of plus or minus 2 per cent. Durant consolidated his poll's reputation for accuracy in 1950 and 1951 with more accurate general election forecasts than his new rivals. The <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> commissioned polls in the run-up to the 1950 general election in response to the success of the Gallup poll for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> in 1945. On the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>'s demise in 1960 he immediately arranged a new deal with the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>.<br>
<br>When his commercial and academic rivals began to criticize his methods in the 1950s and early 1960s Durant engaged in ferocious debate. Durant had dismissed the qualitative research methods employed by Mass-Observation during the 1940s, labelling Tom Harrisson a high-class journalist. When Harry Henry, another industry pioneer, attacked Durant's use of quota sampling and untrained interviewers a decade later there were cross words at the Market Research Society, an industry body both men had helped to found in 1947. More hurtful still was the scorn of academic psephologists, as Durant retained his links with academe throughout his business career. Simplistic descriptions of his methods and unsophisticated interpretations of his poll results in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> and later the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> did not impress the new breed of political scientists.<br>
<br>Durant's reputation among statisticians remained high, while the market research industry also held him in regard. Not only did he introduce Gallup's polling techniques to the UK, but he also developed a business model copied by his rivals. His links with Gallup's other European affiliates and his personal commitment to internationalism, evident from his time as secretary to the British National Committee for Intellectual Co-operation, prompted him to play a leading role in the creation of the European Society for Marketing and Opinion Research; he was its third president (1952&#150;4). As a lifelong socialist and supporter of the Labour Party Durant tried to be a benevolent employer. Initially the firm provided work for his first wife's sisters and mother, whom he helped to escape Nazi Germany. He also helped many young market researchers to develop their careers through both his own firm and his involvement with industry bodies.<br>
<br>Durant sold Social Surveys Ltd to Mercury Securities in 1963, but continued to be involved with the firm until ill health forced him to retire from business in 1968. He died at the Royal Free Hospital, London, on 8 June 1982; his funeral was held on 19 June at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
