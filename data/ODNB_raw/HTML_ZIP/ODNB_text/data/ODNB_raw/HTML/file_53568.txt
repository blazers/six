<span class="headword">Hutton,  John Henry</span>  (1885&#150;1968), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born on 27 June 1885 at West Heslerton, Malton, Yorkshire, the son of Joseph Henry Hutton, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Clarissa Marshall, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barwick. He was educated at Chigwell School and at Worcester College, Oxford, where he took a third in modern history in 1907. He became a member of the Indian Civil Service in 1909 and spent most of his administrative career in Assam, on the border between India and Burma, particularly in the Naga hills. From 1917 to 1919 he was political officer with responsibility for the Kuki operations. He became increasingly interested in the culture and society of the peoples with whom he worked, and with the encouragement of Henry Balfour, the curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum, who visited him in the Naga hills, decided to document their lives in various ways. From 1920 onwards he wrote many articles about the Nagas, and in 1921 published two seminal monographs, <span class="italic">The Angami Nagas</span> and <span class="italic">The Sema Nagas</span>. On 6 March 1920 he married a widow, Stella Eleanora (<i>d</i>. 1944), daughter of the Revd Rhys Bishop. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Hutton's most important administrative work came when he was appointed census commissioner for the census of India in 1929, a position he held until 1933. The first and third parts of the first volume of the census report bear the clear imprint of Hutton; he played a vital role in collating and organizing the mammoth undertaking. He applied the knowledge he had gained in this work in the writing of his most frequently cited book, <span class="italic">Caste in India</span> (1946; 4th edn, 1963), which anticipated many subsequent developments in the field, for example concerning the diversity of caste groups and their hierarchical ordering. He also played an important part in the discussions which determined the treatment of the tribal populations of India in the legislation concerning scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and their rights during the fifteen years before independence.<br>
<br>In 1936 Hutton resigned from the Indian Civil Service, and took up the prestigious William Wyse chair of social anthropology in Cambridge, becoming the second holder of the post and successor to another Naga expert, T. C. Hodson. He was elected a fellow of St Catharine's College at that time, and an honorary fellow in 1951. In the department of anthropology he built up connections with students being trained for the colonial civil service and encouraged, among other things, the teaching of material culture. His distinction as an anthropologist was recognized by the award of the degree of DSc by Oxford University, and his presidency of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1944&#150;5). He had won the Rivers memorial medal of the institute in 1929. He gave the Frazer memorial lecture in 1938, and in 1932 won the silver medal of the Royal Society of Arts. His first wife died in 1944, and on 7 December 1945 Hutton married Maureen Margaret O'Reilly (<i>b</i>. 1901/2), an assistant museum curator. He retired from his professorship in 1950, and died on 23 May 1968 at his home, 4 Rectory Lane, New Radnor, in Radnorshire, the county of which he had been high sheriff in 1943.<br>
<br>It is clear from a number of sources that Hutton became very involved with the lives, diverse histories, and cultures of the various tribal groups who lived in the eastern Himalayas. He became interested in their connections with other megalithic cultures in south-east Asia and Oceania, and wrote important articles on the possible links between them. He provided important clues to the function of head-hunting in the area. He worked closely with, and guided, his younger colleague John Philip Mills, and inspired the next generation of experts in the area, particularly Christoph von F&uuml;rer-Haimendorf. The monographs of these three writers covered most of the major Naga tribes, the Angami, Sema, Lhota, Ao, Rengma, and Konyak. Hutton's ethnography and deep knowledge of the people he wrote about evidently set a very high standard. As well as these extensive writings, Hutton, Mills, and Haimendorf set out to collect objects, from the everyday to the ornate. Most of Hutton's extensive collections are in the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, where many of his photographs and some rare wax cylinder recordings which he made are also to be found. Combined with the detailed reports of his tours and other administrative papers in the Oriental and India Office collections at the British Library, his work helped to make the Nagas one of the best documented tribal groups in the world. This is particularly important since he was working just at the point when an ancient and forest-dwelling population, enormously rich in its material culture and varied in every way, was being incorporated into the British empire.<br>
