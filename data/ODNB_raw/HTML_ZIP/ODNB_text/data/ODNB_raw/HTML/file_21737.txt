<span class="headword">Pechey,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1654, <em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the elder son of William Pechey (<i>d</i>. 1702), a practitioner of physic and surgery, was baptized on 11 December 1654 in Chichester, Sussex. Pechey matriculated at New Inn Hall, Oxford, on 22 March 1672, took his BA on 29 November 1675, and obtained his MA on 10 June 1678. An undated handbill of his, perhaps from the mid-1680s, advertised his move from &#145;Chequer-yard, near Dowgate, to Queen Street, near Cheapside&#146;, London, where he could be seen every day from nine to one o'clock, charging no more than 1<i>s</i>., and offering free advice to the poor of his parish. From mid-October to mid-December 1684 he took the three-part examination of the Royal College of Physicians, and was awarded its licentiate on 22 December. On 12 August 1687 he signed a contract joining with four other licentiates of the college in a five-year lease on a property known as the Golden Angel and Crown in King's Street, London (the &#145;repository&#146;), where they collected a stock of drugs and saw patients by turns. At the same time, each continued his private practice. They advertised by distributing handbills and by printing the jointly authored <span class="italic">Oracle for the Sick</span> (1687), which contained a series of medical questions with answers: the patient could circle or fill in the appropriate answers, send in the pamphlet, and get a diagnosis and medicines in the return post. Pechey also circulated handbills saying that &#145;the sick may have advice for nothing. And approved medicines at reasonable rates&#146;, and giving his address as the Angel and Crown in King's Street. When the lease on the repository practice ran out, about September 1692, Pechey moved to the Angel and Crown in Basing Lane, from where he circulated advertisements for pills to cure the French pox and scurvy: the pills could be taken at any time and &#145;hinder no business&#146;. He also advertised in the <span class="italic">Athenian Mercury</span> in November 1693, and probably in other papers as well. From the start the censors of the Royal College of Physicians disliked the repository practice and its members, and from 15 November 1688 Pechey was personally named as needing to be disciplined for his advertising. The censors first warned him; when he continued to publish his announcements and refused to take down the sign over his door advertising his practice, he was fined &pound;4. In the legal confusion following the revolution of 1688 Pechey simply refused to pay the fine. But from January 1690 to February 1694 Pechey and the censors engaged in battles, sometimes in court, over his behaviour, and unpaid dues and fines. His battles led to new attempts to discipline the members of the college generally.<br>
<br>About the time that Pechey had joined the college, he had begun to translate some of Thomas Sydenham's works into English. Since Sydenham, too, held the rank of licentiate, Pechey probably met him no later than 1684, during the process of joining the college. It is probable that Pechey had the tacit support of Sydenham in publishing, in the autumn of 1686, the first part of his <span class="italic">Collections of Acute Diseases</span>, which translated Sydenham's work on smallpox and measles. The next two parts (1688) and parts four and five (1691) were also mainly translations from Sydenham; they were gathered together and issued by Henry Bonwick in 1691 with a single title page as <span class="italic">Collections of Acute Diseases, in Five Parts</span>. This was quickly followed by Pechey's <span class="italic">A Collection of Chronical Diseases</span> (1693), which, apart from the first chapter, was again from Sydenham. Pechey quickly followed with <span class="italic">Promptuarium praxeos medicae</span> (1693), with chapters on diseases and their cures listed alphabetically; <span class="italic">The London Dispensatory</span> (1694), a guide to useful medicines; and <span class="italic">The Compleat Herbal of Physical Plants</span> (1694), which contained directions for using simples and for making compounds. In these works, published during his disputes with the officers of the college, Pechey made plain his advocacy of clinical experience. In the preface to <span class="italic">The London Dispensatory</span>, he lambasted &#145;the vain fictions of a sort of men, whose business it is, to make every part of [medicine] obscure and misterious&#146;; in <span class="italic">The Store-House of Physical Practice</span> (a rearranged translation of his <span class="italic">Promptuarium</span>, brought out in early 1695), he wrote that &#145;plain Practice must expect but cold Entertainment with the speculative Physician&#146;, and that &#145;Reason and Argument are not the true Tests of Physick, nor indeed of any thing else, when Experience, the great Baffler of Speculation, can determine the Matter&#146;. He continued to promote the &#145;practical medicine&#146; of Sydenham, and issued <span class="italic">The Whole Works</span> of Sydenham in English (drawing on his earlier translations and adding the rest) in 1696. He continued with five more English medical collections brought out between 1696 and 1698. Almost all Pechey's works ended with an advertisement for his pills.<br>
<br>In 1695 Pechey was listed as living in the parish of St Mary Aldermary, with his wife, Ann, a daughter, Ann, and two sons, Joseph and Whitlock. About Michaelmas of 1706 he moved to a corner of Robin Hood's Court, Bow Lane. He made out his will on 30 July 1718, naming a nephew, Francis, as well as the rest of the family, and was buried on 21 August 1718 in St Mary Aldermary. His eldest son later advertised that he was selling Pechey's pills from his house in Robin Hood's Court, carrying on his father's legacy.<br>
<br>In all likelihood, the <a name="cosubject_21669"></a><span class="headword">John Peachie</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1683), <span class="occ">physician</span>, who was an MD of Caen and extra licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (26 July 1683), was not the same person as above. To this other Peachie has been ascribed, on slender evidence, a series of short tracts, published from 1672 to 1695, on various exotic botanicals, with titles of the form: <span class="italic">Some Observations Made upon the &hellip; Written by &hellip;</span>.<br>
