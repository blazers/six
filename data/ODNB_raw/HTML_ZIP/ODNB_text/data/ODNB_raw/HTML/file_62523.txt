<span class="headword">Rudler,  Gustave</span>  (1872&#150;1957), <span class="occ">French scholar</span>, was born in Besan&ccedil;on, France, on 11 January 1872, the son of a teacher at the local <i>lyc&eacute;e</i>, and educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand and the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in Paris. Taking the first place nationally in the <i>agr&eacute;gation</i>, he was appointed as professor of rhetoric at, successively, <i>lyc&eacute;es</i> in St &Eacute;tienne, Caen, and finally his old school of Louis-le-Grand. In 1908 he successfully defended his doctoral thesis, &#145;La jeunesse de Benjamin Constant, 1767&#150;1794&#146;. When published, this work achieved the distinction of being <i>couronn&eacute;</i> by the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise, being seen as a pioneering study in the field of Constant literature and remaining authoritative on this early period of the author's life.<br>
<br>Rudler was briefly a lecturer at the Sorbonne until in 1913 he was appointed professor of French at Bedford College in the University of London. The rest of his professional life was spent in England. The tenure of the chair, however, was interrupted by the obligations of military service in the First World War. He subsequently returned to Bedford College, remaining there until 1920, when he was elected to the newly created Marshal Foch chair of French literature at the University of Oxford, which carried with it a fellowship at All Souls College. He held this chair until his retirement in 1949, then returned to Paris, dying there on 17 October 1957. His wife, Madeleine, had predeceased him in 1946.<br>
<br>Rudler's scholarship is strongly marked by the influence of the famous French scholar and critic Gustave Lanson, who had directed his doctoral research, and he came to see himself as Lanson's disciple. Indeed, his lavish praise for Lanson's work aroused intense irritation in such opponents as Charles P&eacute;guy in the years preceding the First World War. Like Lanson, he held a fervent belief in the importance of clear order and logical thinking in literary criticism, via the traditional French methods of <i>explication de texte</i> and <i>dissertation</i> (essay writing), allied to a lucid and exactingly accurate analysis of literary texts. In pursuit of this objective, he wrote a primer on textual criticism, <span class="italic">L'explication fran&ccedil;aise: principes et application</span> (1902), and, for more advanced students, <span class="italic">Les techniques de la critique et de l'histoire litt&eacute;raire</span> (1923), which he dedicated to Lanson. These works carried the Lansonian gospel to Britain, with consequences that, in the view of many, unduly encouraged a &#145;scientific&#146; approach to French studies in this country.<br>
<br>Rudler's own scholarly publications ranged widely, but had a particular emphasis on Benjamin Constant. His <i>th&egrave;se compl&eacute;mentaire</i> for the doctorate had been a &#145;Bibliographie critique des oeuvres de Benjamin Constant&#146;, which was published, like his main thesis, in 1908. He later provided a critical edition of Constant's most well-known work, <span class="italic">Adolphe</span> (1919), and over the years he composed several articles and lectures on the author. But he also wrote a two-volume study, <span class="italic">Michelet: historien de Jeanne d'Arc</span> (1925&#150;6), and a critical edition of Michelet's eponymous work on Joan of Arc (1927). Late in his career he provided important editions for the Blackwells <span class="roman">French Texts</span> series of Racine's <span class="italic">Mithridate</span> (1943) and Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le misanthrope</span> (1947). In addition, he wrote articles on themes and authors as widely ranging as the correspondence of Guez de Balzac, the political content of Chateaubriand's <span class="italic">Les martyrs</span>, the historical sources of Mme de Lafayette's <span class="italic">La princesse de Cl&egrave;ves</span>, and the portrait scene in Victor Hugo's <span class="italic">Hernani</span>. His published writings extended over a half-century, from 1898 to 1947.<br>
<br>Rudler edited the <span class="italic">Revue universitaire</span> and the <span class="italic">Revue critique des livres nouveaux</span> (both 1910&#150;13), and later the <span class="italic">French Quarterly</span> (1919&#150;32), the first English periodical devoted to French literature, thought, and art, of which he was the founder (with A. Terracher). He was warmly remembered at Oxford for his devotion to scholarship and teaching alike; a former pupil recalled that he lectured rapidly and entirely in French, firing at students in the audience questions that had to be answered in the language. While lecturing on plays he acted out certain scenes, on one occasion hiding under a table when the plot required it. In 1952 a Festschrift was presented to him, <span class="italic">The French Mind</span>, edited by Will Moore, Rhoda Sutherland, and Enid Starkie, with a foreword by Alfred Ewert that describes the book as &#145;a token of gratitude and admiration for the scholar and of esteem and affection for the man&#146;.<br>
