<span class="headword">Russell,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1612), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, probably came from a Fife family, but nothing is known of his parents. He is first recorded in 1566, when he received a bachelor's degree from St Leonard's College, in the University of St Andrews; this suggests he was born about 1550. In 1568 he received his MA, and on 28 August 1571, when he was granted a crown pension, he was still described as a student at St Leonard's. He was probably studying law, for on 24 March 1575 he joined the Faculty of Advocates. However, he does not appear to have practised much at first; instead he began to teach, and on 23 March 1580 was called &#145;doctor utriusque juris&#146; (&#145;doctor of civil and canon law&#146;).<br>
<br>From the early 1580s Russell's practice at the bar expanded greatly. In Scotland, unlike in England, a lawyer could plead for clients in criminal cases, and Russell became a criminal specialist. Pitcairn's <span class="italic">Ancient Criminal Trials</span>, selected from manuscript sources, shows Russell in fifty-eight cases between 1580 and 1612, more than any other lawyer. He appeared in some of the most famous and important trials in Scottish history, including the witchcraft trials of Barbara Napier and Euphame MacCalzean, and the 1593 treason trial of the earl of Bothwell. He also had a flourishing civil practice. In 1599 he successfully defended the Edinburgh minister Robert Bruce when James VI tried to deprive him of his pension. On 19 May 1590 he made a Latin oration at Queen Anne's entry into Edinburgh. In 1604 he wrote a tract entitled <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Happie and Blissed Unioun</span>, supporting further union between England and Scotland. It survives in two manuscripts, one a first draft, the other an Anglicized version sent to the king in London; the Scottish version was printed in 1985 by the Scottish History Society.<br>
<br>Russell's is one of the longest of twenty-eight surviving treatises that formed part of the union debate in Scotland and England between 1603 and 1605. It is organized as a three-part dialectic, containing arguments first against the union, then in favour of it, and finally refuting the contrary and affirming the positive positions. An appendix contains some practical suggestions. The principal reason given for a union is the increased strength that this will give a united Great Britain, in both religion and secular policy. But Russell approaches his topic as a patriotic lowland Scot. Any union must treat the two countries as equals and not subordinate Scotland to England: &#145;God forbid! Bettir that we of this age had nevir bein borne, than to sie that miserie in our tyme, thairby to amit [lose] that libertie quhilk our predicessoris have sua lang enjoyit&#146;  (Russell, 84). The treatise reveals Russell's characteristics in many other fields, as a committed protestant with an abiding hatred for &#145;Papistis, falselie callit catholiques&#146;  (ibid., 117), and as a well-read man able to quote classical authors from Plato to Eusebius, and moderns such as Machiavelli and Bodin. As befits a doctor of civil and canon law, he mentions various Roman law writers, and cites papal decretals. He decries the lawlessness and disobedience of borderers, highlanders, and princely nobles who think themselves above the law. He produces some astute analyses. He predicts that if the king does not return to reside from time to time in Scotland, the result will be &#145;ane aristocracie&#146; and the loss of &#145;the heartis of his people heir&#146;  (ibid., 102), a fair description of what happened in the covenanting revolution of 1637&#150;41.<br>
<br>Russell emerges in both his career and his treatise as an honest but difficult person. In 1602 he ruthlessly pursued three people whom he suspected of burning his house. On 13 May 1609 he refused to obey a direct command from the privy council ordering him to defend Sir James MacDonald of Dunyvaig in a criminal trial. In the treatise, while Russell heaps praise on King James, he also scatters criticisms and unwelcome advice throughout the text; much of this was eliminated from the final draft, but some remained. This may help explain why Russell was rarely employed on public business. Russell had at least two sons, John (born before 4 March 1584), who became a lawyer, and James. He married Marion Carmichael on 17 November 1596, but must have had an earlier wife who was John's mother. He was successful enough to acquire the lands of Wester Granton in Edinburghshire. He died on 7 October 1612. In his inventory, his library was valued at &pound;133 Scots and the king owed him &pound;1200 Scots. His total estate, exclusive of his lands, was worth &pound;2386 Scots.<br>
