<span class="headword">Young,  Geoffrey Winthrop</span>  (1876&#150;1958), <span class="occ">mountaineer and educationist</span>, was born on 25 October 1876 in London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37075/', "Sir George Young, third baronet (1837&#150;1930)")</script>, and his wife, Alice Eacy (1840&#150;1922), daughter of Evory Kennedy, a Dublin physician, and widow of Sir Alexander Hutchinson Lawrence, first baronet. He was the third of four children. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37071/', "(Edward) Hilton Young")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Wymondley, Marlborough College (1890&#150;95), and Trinity College, Cambridge (1895&#150;8), where he studied classics (BA 1898, MA 1902), and was awarded the chancellor's medal for English verse in 1897 and 1898. He then studied the French and German languages in Europe, including a period in Geneva and a year at Jena University (1899&#150;1900).<br>
<br>Geoffrey Young was one of the most famous British mountaineers before the First World War. He began climbing mountains as an undergraduate and popularized collegiate roof climbing with the jocular <span class="italic">The Roof-Climber's Guide to Trinity</span> (1899), and the literary <span class="italic">Wall and Roof Climbing</span> (1905). His many notable first ascents in the Alps included several ridges in the Zermatt district that became known as Younggrat. His pre-war climbing is perhaps best remembered for his description in <span class="italic">On High Hills</span> (1927) of the first ascent of the south face of the T&auml;schhorn in 1906, with Franz Lochmatter, Josef Lochmatter, Valentine John Eustace Ryan (<i>d</i>. 1947), and Josef Knubel (1881&#150;1961), who was frequently Young's guide. In 1907 he began organizing climbing retreats during Easter at the Pen y Pass hostel in Snowdonia, and this annual event brought together the leading British climbers for many years. Many of his companions and pupils died climbing, and he personally recovered the bodies of Donald Robertson (1879&#150;1910) near Pen y Pass, Humphrey Owen Jones (1878&#150;1912) in the Alps, and Hugh Rose Pope (<i>d</i>. 1912) in the Pyrenees. Another of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, George Mallory, disappeared on Everest in 1924.<br>
<br>Young's career in education began in 1900 with brief periods teaching at various schools. In 1902 he was appointed tutor in modern languages at Eton College. There he introduced several students to climbing, including Marcus Beresford Heywood (1886&#150;1947). In 1905 Young was dismissed from Eton for a homosexual liaison  (Hankinson, 67), and became an HM inspector of secondary schools. Although he enjoyed this work, he once again resigned from it abruptly in 1913. His diaries during these years record the tension between his public probity and private pleasures in the homosexual underworlds of Berlin, Paris, and Soho  (ibid., 129). During 1913&#150;14 he retreated to an Italian villa to write about mountaineering, and lived briefly with Wilbert Spencer, a Cornish boy who was killed in action in 1915.<br>
<br>Young served in Belgium and France as a war correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> during July&#150;September 1914, and his dispatches were collected in <span class="italic">From the Trenches</span> (1914). From October 1914 to July 1915 he founded and commanded the Friends' Ambulance Unit in Flanders, and served mostly at Ypres. In August 1915 he joined his close friend George Macaulay Trevelyan and Philip Noel-Baker to form the first British ambulance unit for Italy, which he commanded until January 1919. He was severely wounded on 31 August 1917 at the battle of Monte San Gabriele, and his left leg was amputated above the knee. He was mentioned in dispatches and received the order of Leopold from Belgium, was a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur of France, received the order of the crown of Italy, and the British campaign medal. He married Eleanor 
    (Len; <i>d</i>. 1994)
  , an actress, the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37974/', "William Cecil Slingsby")</script>, on 25 April 1918 at St George's, Hanover Square. They had a son, Jocelin, in 1919, and a daughter, Marcia, in 1925, but Geoffrey continued to have homosexual affairs after their marriage  (Hankinson, 210).<br>
<br>After the war Young also continued to write and to climb with only one leg. He published <span class="italic">Mountain Craft</span> (1920), a manual of mountaineering technique, and <span class="italic">On High Hills</span> (1927), on his pre-war ascents, both of which inspired the next generation of climbers. Most inspirational were his climbs with a custom-designed peg-leg. After ascending Monte Rosa in 1927, over the next few years he climbed Wellenkuppe, Matterhorn, Petits Charmoz, Requin, and Gr&eacute;pon. He resolved to give up climbing while on the summit of Zinal Rothorn in 1935, and described these ascents in <span class="italic">Mountains with a Difference</span> (1951), winner of the W. H. Heinemann prize for 1952.<br>
<br>Young served as consultant in the humanities for Europe to the Laura Spelman Rockefeller memorial (1925&#150;9) and the Rockefeller Foundation (1929&#150;33), for which he earned $10,000 a year and spent long periods in Geneva, Paris, and Berlin. In this capacity he proposed what became the Abraham Lincoln Stiftung, dispersed grants to French historians, and met Kurt Hahn, whose innovative school in Salem, Germany, included outdoor sports in the curriculum. After Hahn fled the Nazis in 1933, Young helped him start Gordonstoun School on the Moray Firth and the Outward Bound schools. Young was chair of the Gordonstoun board, and he recommended the school to Prince Philip of Greece (later the duke of Edinburgh), who became one of its earliest students. From 1932 to 1941 he was Thomas Wall reader in comparative education at the University of London. As president during 1941&#150;3, he rejuvenated the Alpine Club from its Edwardian torpor and played a crucial role in founding the British Mountaineering Council, a national federation of climbing clubs. He published several volumes of poetry, including <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1936), a non-climbing autobiography, <span class="italic">The Grace of Forgetting</span> (1953), and contributed to <span class="italic">Snowdon Biography</span> (1957), a history of climbing in Wales. He received an honorary DLitt from Durham University in 1950.<br>
<br>Later in life Young referred to himself as an &#145;elderly celebrity, second-class&#146;  (Hankinson, 2). Although only 5 feet 9 inches tall, he usually cut an imposing figure, with lambent eyes, bushy moustache, pipe, monocle, fedora or beret, and cascading cloak. He admired vitality above all else, and contemporaries were impressed by his forceful personality. Apart from the period when he worked for the Rockefeller Foundation, his personal finances were often precarious. In 1955 he and his wife moved into Grovehurst, Horsmonden, Kent, the first home they ever owned. He died of stomach cancer on 6 September 1958 at a nursing home, 48 Holland Park, Kensington, London. After he was cremated, his ashes were scattered on the peaks above Pen y Pass.<br>
