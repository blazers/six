<span class="headword">Cornford,  Christopher Francis</span>  (1917&#150;1993), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born on 9 February 1917 at Conduit Head, Madingley Road, Cambridge, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32571/', "Francis Macdonald Cornford (1874&#150;1943)")</script>, professor of ancient philosophy and author of best-selling studies of Plato, and Frances Crofts Darwin (1886&#150;1960) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32570/', "Cornford, Frances Crofts")</script>], well-known poet and granddaughter of Charles Darwin. His elder brother, by just over a year, was the radical poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37313/', "(Rupert) John Cornford")</script>. There were five children, who grew up as members of the Darwin clan in 1920s Cambridge: Christopher's governess was Dorothy Bristow, who later became an influential art teacher. The Greek philosophy, the Darwin connection, the radicalism, the wit, and the visual art all resurfaced in later life. Educated at Stowe School (with John) and the Leys School, Cambridge, Cornford went to Chelsea College of Art in 1934 and was awarded an art teacher's diploma in 1937. He was a visiting instructor there and at Morley College from 1937 to 1939 and met his future wife, (Mary) Lucy Jameson (1912/13&#150;1991), daughter of Julian Veitch Jameson, an indigo planter. They were married on 1 February 1941, and had two sons.<br>
<br>Together with his brother John (who went to Cambridge), Christopher joined the British Communist Party in the mid-1930s and marched against Oswald Mosley's blackshirts. John then joined the International Brigades to fight against Franco in Spain, and was shot and killed by the fascists on or just after his twenty-first birthday. Christopher never quite got over this tragedy: it confirmed him in a lifelong commitment to creating a better-organized society. He once said that he and his brother &#145;were always seeking the reality behind surface appearance&#146;  (personal knowledge). During the Second World War Christopher served in the Royal Artillery. From 1946 to 1953 he was master of painting in the department of fine art at King's College, University of Durham, then from 1955 to 1962 visiting instructor in drawing and architecture in the school of architecture at Cambridge.<br>
<br>But it was at the Royal College of Art in London's South Kensington, which he joined full-time in autumn 1962, that Christopher Cornford at last found a spiritual and intellectual home and a new set of causes with which to identify. He was appointed by his cousin Robin Darwin, who was then principal and a great believer in a dynastic approach to senior appointments, to take over (from Basil Taylor) the direction of the department of general studies. The department had been founded to offer courses on the history, philosophy, and criticism of art and design to all the practitioner students in the studios&#151;some of whom had been over-specializing in art from an early age. Darwin was convinced that young artists and designers, if they were to succeed, ought to be equipped with &#145;amused and well-tempered minds&#146;; the reformers of British art education (the Coldstream and Summerson committees) were simultaneously proposing an expansion of theoretical studies within art schools. Cornford's unusual mix of an excellent eye, drawing skills, scholarship, and personal modesty was very well suited to this role as intellectual troubadour.<br>
<br>Cornford assembled a supergroup of visiting authors (including Iris Murdoch and George Steiner) to supplement a committed team of staff tutors. The courses he conceived and directed and the long &#145;critical essays&#146; which all students had to write about them as an integral part of their postgraduate studies became models in the post-1960s, national system; they also helped the Royal College of Art's progress towards university status, which it achieved on royal charter day in 1967. By the early 1970s he had introduced MA-by-thesis students into his department, and in the mid-1970s doctoral students.<br>
<br>Cornford's own research interests centred on theories of proportion in art and design (on which he lectured and supervised theses), and in particular the geometry of the &#145;golden section&#146;. Although the Darwin years at the Royal College of Art (1947&#150;72) were partly about establishing the college as the artistic equivalent of &#145;walking past the great court of Trinity on crisp autumn evenings&#146; (as the principal, who became rector in 1967, put it), Christopher Cornford remained magnificently anti-establishment: he had a lot of sympathy after 1968 with the student radicals, most of whom, in Britain unlike continental Europe and America, came from art schools; in the 1970s he became an early green activist, hosting a seminal &#145;Design for need&#146; conference in April 1976, and even staffed a fair-trade stall in the college for the sale of varieties of rice until his impressionistic approach to weights and measures led to its closure. After retirement in summer 1979 he became a characteristically active chairman of the Cambridge Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a mainstay of the University of the Third Age, as well as continuing to paint, write, and draw gentle political cartoons.<br>
<br>Cornford's most important legacy is in the minds and memories of successive generations of artists and designers graduating from the Royal College of Art. They remember his humanity, his support (he once missed a key faculty board meeting to attend a student picnic in Kensington Gardens), his inspirational seminars, and his extraordinary impish performances as public orator every convocation day in early July&#151;performances which enlivened the proceedings and gave them a distinctive art school twist, through a combination of outrageous puns, a parody florid style, and misused quotations. His valedictory lecture of June 1979 was called &#145;The repeal of disillusion&#146;, and when he died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge on 8 April 1993&#151;after being admitted for heart surgery, only to discover that he had cancer of the spine&#151;he had just finished drafting his <i>magnum opus</i> (begun twenty years earlier) on proportion in art and design. Lucy Cornford had died, after a debilitating illness, in 1991.<br>
