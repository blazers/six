<span class="headword">Balfour,  Francis Maitland</span>  (1851&#150;1882), <span class="occ">comparative embryologist and morphologist</span>, was born on 10 November 1851 at Queen Street, Edinburgh, the fifth of the eight children (and third son) of James Maitland Balfour (1820&#150;1856), landowner and MP, and Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil (1825&#150;1872), second daughter of James Gascoyne-Cecil, second marquess of Salisbury, and his wife, Frances Mary. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30553/', "Arthur James Balfour (1848&#150;1930)")</script>, Conservative prime minister, was an elder brother; his sister Nora married Henry Sidgwick (1838&#150;1900), the philosopher.<br>
<br>Raised at Whittingehame in East Lothian, Frank, as he was known, showed an early aptitude for natural history. After two years at The Grange, a private boarding-school at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, in 1866 he went to Harrow School. There his abilities in natural history were honed by George Griffith, the school's first science master. Although he was considered by some to be awkward and uncoordinated, Balfour's forceful personality was already obvious, and it led many to believe he would soon make his mark. Indeed, a geological essay written for the Harrow Scientific Society in 1868 brought him to the attention of Thomas Huxley, whose influence was to be lifelong.<br>
<br>Balfour entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1870, and won a natural science scholarship the following spring (Huxley was an examiner). Michael Foster, praelector in physiology, encouraged him to undertake original research on the nature of the primitive streak in chick embryos and its possible relationship to the amphibian blastopore. Thus began Balfour's pursuit of homologies between embryos of different organisms, which led to his first three papers in embryology and <span class="italic">The Elements of Embryology</span> (1874), co-authored with Foster. Balfour graduated in December 1873, though the time spent on his investigations &#145;diminished somewhat the brilliancy of his degree, for he was placed second instead of first, as had been expected, in the Natural Sciences Tripos&#146;  (Clark, 284).<br>
<br>In February 1874 Balfour was one of the first two British naturalists to work at Anton Dohrn's Stazione Zoologica in Naples, where shark and dogfish embryology was the subject of his investigations. Embryology was considered the best means to establish evolutionary relationships, and elasmobranchs, as primitive vertebrates, were thought likely to illuminate vertebrate ancestry. This initial work, presented in August to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), brought Balfour to the attention of the British scientific community. On 17 October he was elected natural sciences fellow of Trinity College; Huxley, the examiner, gave more weight to research than to examination results.<br>
<br>As part of his efforts to establish physiology, histology, and embryology at Cambridge, Foster gave responsibility for embryology and morphology to Balfour. The latter's first lectures in embryology in July 1875 were only a modest success, and an inadequate forecast of his enormously popular lectures as lecturer in animal morphology from October 1876. During this period Balfour also continued his research work at Naples. His <span class="italic">Monograph on the Development of Elasmobranch Fishes</span> (4 vols., 1878) enhanced his reputation as a leading evolutionary embryologist, and led to his election as FRS at the age of twenty-six in June 1878.<br>
<br>Under Balfour's direction the Cambridge Morphological Laboratory became the world centre for comparative and evolutionary embryology. Students such as Adam Sedgwick, William Bateson, D'Arcy Thompson, William Weldon, and Henry Osborn were attracted to work with Balfour, as much for his personality as for his growing scientific reputation. The awkward, uncompromising youth had grown into a tall man who, though brilliant and admired by all, retained an endearing shyness.<br>
<br>Although most of the research was left to his students, Balfour was not idle. He ran the laboratory, assisted by Adam Sedgwick, who succeeded him as director. He threw himself energetically into college and university committees, and in 1880 was vice-president of section D of the BAAS. In four years of intensive labour he synthesized all available embryological knowledge into the comprehensive and highly acclaimed <span class="italic">Treatise on Comparative Embryology</span> (2 vols., 1880&#150;81). While he accepted a recapitulation of evolution in development, he avoided the doctrinaire excesses of Ernst Haeckel. From his very first paper he sought to separate primary features from secondary embryonic or larval adaptations, and sought evidence for natural selection during ontogeny, as he documented the links between embryology and evolution. Balfour's law relates yolk concentration to the rate of cell division in the early embryo.<br>
<br>Balfour's work brought him much acclaim, especially after publication of the <span class="italic">Treatise</span>. A Royal Society medal, appointment as the youngest member of the society's council, and an honorary LLD degree from Glasgow University all came his way in 1881 and it seemed that an illustrious career lay ahead. However, despite these accolades, and the growth of animal morphology at Cambridge, the brightest new star in the biological sky, who Darwin thought would &#145;one day be the first of English Biologists&#146;  (Dugdale, 1.70), held no appointment at the university. Oxford sought him as Linacre professor of human and comparative anatomy, and Edinburgh as regius professor of natural history. Balfour was tempted by Edinburgh, which was less than 30 miles from Whittingehame, the family seat. In January 1882, however, Foster spearheaded a petition to the Cambridge senate seeking a university position for Balfour. Just weeks later, in Capri, while nursing a student, William Caldwell, back to health, Balfour contracted typhoid. It was thought he would not live. Cambridge was finally moved to act and appointed him to a &#145;Professorship of Animal Morphology terminable with the tenure of the first Professor&#146;  (Clark, 288).<br>
<br>By July 1882 Balfour had recuperated sufficiently to travel to Switzerland for his favourite relaxation, alpine climbing. After testing his condition on some easy climbs, he and a guide set out on 18 July to scale Mont Blanc. Both men died on the glacier of Treyney, Courmayeur, Italy, on 19 July. Balfour was buried at Whittingehame on 5 August. Reactions to his death indicate the depth of loss felt by friends and the scientific and university communities. For Huxley the deaths of Darwin and Balfour in the same year meant the loss of &#145;the best of the old and the best of the young&#146;  (Huxley, 2.38). Cambridge established a library and a studentship in Balfour's name. The first studentship went to William Caldwell, whose discovery &#145;monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic&#146;, cabled to the BAAS meeting in Montreal in 1884, was a dramatic demonstration of the evolutionary embryology espoused by Balfour.<br>
