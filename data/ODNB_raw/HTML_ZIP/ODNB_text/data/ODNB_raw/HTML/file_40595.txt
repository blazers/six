<span class="headword">Pirie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Patey]</span>,  Antoinette</span>  (1905&#150;1991), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 4 October 1905 in Bond Street, London, the daughter of William James Patey (<i>d</i>. 1941), who owned a pharmacist's shop in Bond Street, and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keen. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey School, to 1924, and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she achieved, in 1932, first-class honours in natural sciences (biochemistry). She then remained at the biochemical laboratory in Cambridge under the professorship of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, where she completed her PhD. On 11 March 1931 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65890/', "Norman Wingate Pirie (1907&#150;1997)")</script>, son of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40594/', "Sir George Pirie")</script>, and himself a distinguished biochemist. They had a son, John, and a daughter, Jane.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1939 Pirie joined a team at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's Mill Hill laboratories, set up to investigate the effect of poison gases on the cornea and how to protect it from injury. The leader of the team was Ida Mann, an ophthalmologist with exceptionally wide interests and enthusiasms; Pirie (who was always known as Tony) was dedicated to the study of the eye for the rest of her life. In 1942 she accompanied Ida Mann to Oxford as her assistant and in 1947 she succeeded her as Margaret Ogilvie's reader in ophthalmology and head of the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology. This was a dramatic appointment of a non-clinician to the Oxford medical school.<br>
<br>In the laboratory Pirie and her collaborators were interested in discovering the causes of major diseases of the eye, usually using biochemical techniques. In 1956 she co-authored with Ruth van Heyningen <span class="italic">Biochemistry of the Eye</span>, which contained an account of almost all the research published anywhere up to that date; the book proved to be a great stimulus to the avalanche of research on the eye that followed in Europe and America.<br>
<br>Studies on many tissues of the eye were performed in the laboratory, but it was the lens and cataract that were Pirie's main preoccupations during her readership. Cataract, the largest cause of blindness in the world, is the loss of transparency of the lens. Much of her earlier work involved the production of cataract by experimental means in animals (rabbits and rats). Later, advances in analytical techniques made it possible to study human cataractous lenses removed at operation.<br>
<br>A thread running through Pirie's scientific work was vitamin A and its importance to the proper functioning of the eye. In 1946 she had shown that damage to the cornea, brought about in rabbits by withholding the vitamin from the diet, was rapidly reversed by its restoration. As she neared retirement she became increasingly concerned that much worldwide blindness in the young was due to easily preventable vitamin A deficiency. In India at least 100,000 children became blind each year from xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency.<br>
<br>Pirie made long visits to Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, where she set up and helped to run a nutrition centre. Here mothers brought their children and were taught to supplement their food with enough vitamin A, as carotene in dark green leafy vegetables, to prevent them going blind.<br>
<br>In 1972 Pirie established and was editor and secretary of the <span class="italic">Xerophthalmia Bulletin</span>. This was published three or four times a year from her home; it comprised extracts from current scientific journals and original articles and comments. It involved an immense amount of work. When she relinquished the editorship in 1985 more than a thousand copies were being distributed worldwide.<br>
<br>Pirie was tall and good-looking, dignified yet friendly, with wit and charm. Jacquetta Hawkes, who knew her at Cambridge, described her as &#145;a handsome undergraduate with strong yet sensitive features; it was the face of a caring person before that term came to be abused&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 2 Dec 1991). She was a person of strong convictions, with the determination and ability to further the causes in which she believed.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Pirie was a passionate supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She made herself an expert on the radioactive hazards of nuclear explosions and in 1957 edited <span class="italic">Fallout</span> to publicize the dangers which at that time the government was tending to minimize or conceal. It was a collaboration of nine working scientists&#151;physicists, geneticists, physicians, and biologists. Pirie's scrupulous accuracy ensured that no criticism could be levelled at the book; Canon Collins of St Paul's Cathedral, a close colleague in the cause, called her &#145;A Rock of Academic Integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 25 Oct 1991). The book made a considerable impact at the time.<br>
<br>Pirie's interests and those of her husband were always close and usually directed towards furthering the welfare of mankind. They were both atheists. Towards the end of their lives there was an interesting coalescence of their research commitments. N. W. Pirie had campaigned fervently for several decades to promote the extraction of proteins from otherwise unused leaves as a beneficial and cheap source of food in underdeveloped parts of the world. It turned out that the leaf extract was also an excellent source of &#946;-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A; this may be an even more important ingredient than the protein.<br>
<br>Antoinette Pirie died at Oakenholt House, Farmoor, Oxford, on 11 October 1991, and was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 22 October. She was survived by her husband, their daughter, and their son, who continued the family's humanitarian concerns, first as managing director of OXFAM Trading, and subsequently as director of the Artisan Trust.<br>
