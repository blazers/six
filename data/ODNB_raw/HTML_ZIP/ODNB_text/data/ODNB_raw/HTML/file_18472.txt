<span class="headword">Meadley,  George Wilson</span>  (1774&#150;1818), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born at Sunderland, co. Durham, on 1 January 1774, the only son of Abraham Meadley and Alice Wilson. His father died in 1775, and his mother soon afterwards moved with her five children to the adjoining town of Bishopwearmouth where Meadley resided for the rest of his life. In 1783 he was placed at the grammar school of Witton-le-Wear, under the Revd John Farrer; he had a remarkable memory and a turn for rhyme, which he cultivated until 1791. At the end of 1788 Meadley was apprenticed to a Mr Chipchase (afterwards alderman), a banker and general dealer at Durham, where he spent his spare time writing poetry (some of which was published in provincial papers), and became involved in debates about abolition of the slave trade and the French Revolution. These inspired him to become an ardent liberal in politics.<br>
<br>After leaving Durham in 1793 Meadley remained at home, learning Italian, improving his French, and founding a subscription library at Sunderland (1795) with the help of his old schoolmaster, now rector of Sunderland. In March 1795 he made the acquaintance of William Paley DD, then made rector of Bishopwearmouth. Next year Meadley went on a mercantile voyage to the Levant. He visited Naples, Smyrna, and Constantinople, collected a library of books, fell into the hands of the French on his return voyage, and was for some time a prisoner in Spain. On his return to England he learned German, and made further mercantile voyages to Danzig (1801) and Hamburg (1803), travelling thence on foot with a friend through north Germany (see accounts in <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, 14, 127 ff., 218 ff., 412 ff.). By now disgusted with trade he devoted himself to a literary life.<br>
<br>Three years after Paley's death (1805) Meadley began to collect materials for his biography, applying, among others, to John Disney DD, who introduced him to Thomas Jervis. His association with these men led to his adoption of Unitarian views. The first edition of his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> of Paley was entirely rewritten before publication, on the advice of a friend who criticized its florid style. When bringing out a second and amended edition he spent the winter (1810&#150;11) in Edinburgh to see it through the press. Here he attended the moral philosophy lectures of Thomas Brown. In 1812 he published <span class="italic">A Sketch of &hellip; Proposals for &hellip; Reform in Parliament</span>, which was printed without his knowledge and with some amendments in Wooller's edition of Bentham's catechism. A biography of Algernon Sydney, a work in keeping with his political principles, followed. He also produced short memoirs of his friends Mrs Jebb and the Revd Robert Waugh, and of Robert Clark, a Sunderland surgeon, for the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>. In 1814 Meadley publicly announced his secession in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Bishop of David's</span>. He wrote a second letter in 1816 after he was mistakenly thought to be becoming a deist.<br>
<br>In 1818 Meadley returned from literary researches in London and the south of England suffering from a &#145;hepatic affection&#146;. It was said that he was a large man, and that his &#145;natural inactivity and his studious habits had led him to indulge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, March 1819, 141). He was working on biographies of John Hampden and Disney, and had ready for press a sketch of the political character of Sir William Jones, and a parallel between Bonaparte and Rienzi when he died at Bishopwearmouth on 28 November 1818. He had never married. He was buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity, Sunderland, and a marble tablet to his memory was placed in the Sunderland Subscription Library. An attempt at the annual meeting (2 February 1819) to have this tablet removed, because of Meadley's religious views, led to an angry local controversy.<br>
<br>Meadley is remembered as unprepossessing but &#145;cheerful &hellip; and affectionate&#146; with strong ethical and religious convictions  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, March 1819, 142). His immediate posthumous reputation suffered; a reader of the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> felt that Meadley's &#145;claims to literary eminence&#146; had been overemphasized and some critics judged his memoirs as &#145;not abundant in novelty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, August 1819, 465; January 1819, 121). But he has recently been praised by Paley scholars (see LeMahieu) and his biography of Paley served as the basis for subsequent work.<br>
