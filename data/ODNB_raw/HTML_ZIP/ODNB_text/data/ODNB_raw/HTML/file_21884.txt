<span class="headword">Pennycuick,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1849), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Soilarzie, Perthshire, on 28 October 1789. He was appointed ensign in the Edinburgh militia on 17 February 1806, entered the army on 31 August 1807 as an ensign in the 78th (Highland) regiment, and became lieutenant on 15 January 1812. He served in the expedition to Java, and was wounded in the attack on the entrenched camp adjoining the fort of Meester-Cornelis on 26 August 1811. He married, at Lanesborough, co. Roscommon, on 21 March 1820, Sarah, daughter of James Farrell, vicar of Rathcline, and they had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Pennycuick was promoted captain on 14 June 1821, and on 13 January 1825 he exchanged into the 47th regiment, with which he took part in the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1825&#150;6. He became major, unattached, on 25 April 1834, and on 8 May 1835 obtained a majority in the 17th foot. With this regiment he took part in the campaign of 1839 in Afghanistan, including the capture of Ghazni, and was afterwards employed in Baluchistan under General Willshire, to subdue the khan of Kalat. He led the storming party in the capture of Kalat on 13 November 1839, and was made CB, having already obtained a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy for Ghazni. He had been made a KH in 1837.<br>
<br>Pennycuick became lieutenant-colonel on 12 June 1840, and in 1841 took and destroyed some Arab posts near Aden. In 1848 he exchanged from the 17th to the 24th regiment; at the end of that year he served in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and commanded a brigade, which consisted of his own and two Indian regiments, in Thackwell's division (afterwards Sir Colin Campbell's). He was in the force under Thackwell which turned the Sikh position on the Chenab, by crossing at Wazirabad, and he was eager to attack at once; but others prevailed, and the Sikhs were allowed to retire. When Lord Gough decided to attack them near Chilianwala, on the afternoon of 13 January 1849, Pennycuick's brigade led the attack. They were told to advance without firing, as the 10th had done at Sobraon. The 24th carried the Sikh guns with a rush, but they had outstripped the two Indian regiments and found themselves exposed, with their own arms unloaded, to a heavy fire from the jungle round them. Pennycuick and Brooks, the other lieutenant-colonel of the 24th&#151;&#145;two officers not surpassed for sound judgment and military daring&#146;, as Gough wrote&#151;were killed, and the brigade was driven back. The 24th lost twenty-two officers and 497 men. Among the officers killed was a younger son of Pennycuick, Alexander, a boy of seventeen, the junior ensign of the regiment:<blockquote>Young Pennycuick, [who] had been on the sick list, was brought to the field in a dooly&#151;there he insisted on going with the Regt. into action&#151;he retired with it, after the repulse, and at the village, heard of his father's fate. Immediately he went to the front in search of the body, and it would appear was killed by its side, for the two were found lying dead together. (Brereton, 122)</blockquote>The two were buried alongside one another on the evening after the battle. Pennycuick's second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21885/', "James Farrell Pennycuick")</script>.<br>
