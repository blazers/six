<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilkinson, Sir  John Gardner</span>  (1797&#150;1875), <span class="occ">Egyptologist</span>, born on 5 October 1797, probably at Little Missenden Abbey, Buckinghamshire, and baptized at Chelsea, London, on 17 January 1798, was the only surviving child of the Revd John Wilkinson and his wife, Mary Anne, daughter of the Revd Richard Gardner. From his father, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, Wilkinson derived his early interest in the scholarship of the past. His mother was also a classical scholar. She taught him how to draw&#151;the only artistic training he ever received. He was orphaned at an early age; his parents left him a small income, which later financed his researches. He became the ward of the Revd Dr Yates. In 1813 Wilkinson entered Harrow School where he came under the influence of its headmaster, George Butler, who encouraged his interests. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1816, but left three years later without taking a degree, to begin his grand tour. He planned to make a leisurely journey through Europe followed by a voyage to Egypt, then a subject of great popular attention, before returning to England and purchasing a commission in the army. As Wilkinson passed through Italy, however, he impressed the accomplished classical scholar Sir William Gell with the depth of his interest in the past and his artistic ability. Gell, who was well connected to scholarly developments, convinced him that he could make a contribution to the study of ancient Egypt and gave him a course of preparatory instruction to that end.<br>
<br>Wilkinson arrived in Egypt on 22 November 1821. He soon became so fascinated with the land that he abandoned all thoughts of an army career and spent the next twelve years there. During that time he travelled widely throughout Egypt, twice ascending the Nile into Nubia and exploring both the eastern and the western deserts. He accomplished an extraordinary amount of work at most of the major archaeological sites then known in Egypt and recorded them in his numerous notebooks and sketchbooks. His sketches are rendered with an accuracy and consistency that make them valuable evidence for monuments that were damaged or destroyed after he drew them. He was among those at the forefront of the field of Egyptology, a discipline so new that its very name had yet to be coined. He followed the decipherment of the hieroglyphs closely and corrected some of Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion's early translations, though the latter's contribution is by far the more important.<br>
<br>The primary focus of Wilkinson's work in Egypt was at ancient Thebes. It was he who initiated the numbering system for the tombs in the Valley of the Kings: some of the numbers that he painted over their entrances may still be seen. He was especially interested in the Tombs of the Nobles on the hill of Shaykh &#145;Abd al-Gurna, recognizing that their naturalistic mode of representation made them evidence for daily life in ancient Egypt. He remodelled one of the tombs (TT 83) into a comfortable habitation that became a well-known landmark for the rest of the century.<br>
<br>During his Egyptian years Wilkinson published several works, among them an account of some of his earliest eastern desert explorations in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> in 1832. He also published two short Egyptological books, both quite rare, <span class="italic">Materia hieroglyphica</span> (1828) and <span class="italic">Extracts from Several Hieroglyphic Subjects</span> (1830). The Royal Geographical Society sponsored the publication of his map of Thebes (1830), an extraordinarily accurate and detailed survey, but so large and expensive as to limit its circulation.<br>
<br>Wilkinson returned to Britain in 1833 and soon afterwards published a survey of both ancient and modern Egypt entitled <span class="italic">Topography of Thebes and General View of Egypt</span> (1835), the most substantial work on Egypt since the French <span class="italic">Description de l'&Eacute;gypte</span>. Wilkinson's greatest published work was <span class="italic">Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians</span> (1837), a profusely illustrated description of ancient Egyptian society. Drawing upon his work in the tombs at Gurna, Wilkinson was able to present a poignant picture of daily life in ancient Egypt that instantly caught the popular imagination. Praised by one reviewer as a &#145;restoration to life, as it were, of the ancient Pharaohs, and their subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, Jan 1839, 120), it passed through many editions, influencing generations of English-speaking readers. Melbourne's government recognized Wilkinson's accomplishments with a knighthood on 26 August 1839. Many observers were impressed that Wilkinson, unlike many continental scholars, had received no government assistance for his researches.<br>
<br>The two decades following the publication of <span class="italic">Ancient Egyptians</span> were years of travel and writing. In Britain, Wilkinson ranged widely and was a frequent guest at country houses. He made several trips to Europe and through the Mediterranean, resulting in numerous publications. For example, a trip into south-eastern Europe in 1844 provided material for <span class="italic">Dalmatia and Montenegro</span> (1848). While it displayed na&iuml;vety about the region's ethnic conflicts, it also contained much significant material, such as documentation of regional costume and a description of the Paulician heresy. Wilkinson returned to Egypt in 1842, 1844, and 1848&#150;9. While these trips hardly matched the first one in range or intensity of research, they provided new experiences, such as an exploration of the eastern delta on one occasion and an ascent of the Nile as far south as Jebel Berkel on another. His last trip to Egypt was in 1855&#150;6; during it he suffered sunstroke while sketching a monument at Thebes. Wilkinson published several other works about ancient Egypt including <span class="italic">The Architecture of the Ancient Egyptians</span> (1850) and <span class="italic">The Egyptians in the Time of the Pharaohs</span> (1857), but none of these matched <span class="italic">Ancient Egyptians</span> in originality or scope. His popular <span class="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Egypt</span> (1847) for John Murray's series of travellers' guides went through many editions.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1856 Wilkinson married Caroline Catherine Lucas (1822&#150;1881), botanical author, daughter of Henry Lucas, of Uplands, Glamorgan. After some years of searching, the Wilkinsons found a permanent residence at the village of Reynoldston in Gower, near Lady Wilkinson's childhood home. In the course of thoroughly renovating their house, named Brynfield House, Wilkinson added a large library where he arranged and rearranged his collections, especially his notebooks and sketchbooks, which he believed still contained unrealized potential. During his Gower years Wilkinson became deeply involved in British antiquities, many of which were only a short walk from his home. He was an officer in the Cambrian Archaeological Association and a contributor to its journal. In 1867 he lent his influential support to the successful effort to save the medieval gate at Tenby. Wilkinson died at Llandovery on 29 October 1875 while returning from an extended visit to his relatives, the Harpur-Crewes, at their estate, Calke Abbey, in Derbyshire. He was buried on 3 November in the churchyard at Llandingad, under a monument of his own design, an obelisk atop a pedestal.<br>
<br>A revised edition of <span class="italic">Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians</span> was published in 1878, brought up to date by Samuel Birch of the department of Egyptian antiquities at the British Museum. Lady Wilkinson's plans for publishing various of her husband's manuscripts came to naught, however. Particularly regrettable in that regard is his &#145;Desert plants of Egypt&#146;, which was drawn in colour on stone, and was ready for publication in every way when a misunderstanding with the printer over the subvention caused the project to be cancelled. The stones were erased soon after, leaving just one lovely lithograph on the prospectus to the never published work. Wilkinson's most enduring legacy to scholarship is probably his notebooks, sketchbooks, and other Egyptological papers, the full value of which has yet to be assessed. These, with most of his other papers, Wilkinson willed to be deposited at Calke Abbey; they subsequently went to the Bodleian Library, Oxford. His collections of antiquities, including his excellent collection of Greek vases, were donated to Harrow School, an indication of his lifelong affection for that institution.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was a member of many scholarly societies and, besides his knighthood, received numerous other honours, more than any Egyptologist of his day. He also published many works in addition to those mentioned above and in many different fields, but his most important contribution by far was to the study of ancient Egypt. With some justice he has been referred to as &#145;the real founder of Egyptology in Great Britain&#146;  (Dawson and Uphill, 443).<br>
