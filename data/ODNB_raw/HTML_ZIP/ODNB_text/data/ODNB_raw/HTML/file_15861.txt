<span class="headword">Lacy,  Roger  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1211), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15854/', "John")</script>, soldier and landowner, and Alice de Vere, who was a cousin of William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, and niece of Aubrey (III) de Vere, earl of Oxford. Roger's father, who was lord of Halton in Cheshire, was son of Richard fitz Eustace, and Aubreye, daughter of Robert de Lisours and cousin of Robert de Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1193), the last direct male descendant of Ilbert de Lacy, lord of Pontefract in the late eleventh century. John the constable was briefly placed in charge of Dublin in 1181, and, later going on crusade, died at Tyre on 11 October 1190. He founded Stanlaw Abbey, Cheshire, about 1172 (it was afterwards transferred to Whalley in 1296, by his descendant Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln), and also the hospital of Castle Donington.<br>
<br>On his father's death Roger de Lacy became constable of Chester. In 1191, having been entrusted by the chancellor with the custody of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham, he hanged two knights who had conspired to surrender these castles to Count John, who in revenge plundered Lacy's lands. On 21 April 1194, several months after Robert de Lacy's death, Roger acquired from his grandmother, Aubreye (Robert's cousin and heir), Robert's lands, and adopted the Lacy name (derived from Lassy in Calvados). Now lord of Pontefract, on 6 June 1194 he granted its burgesses a charter of liberties. In April 1199 he was among the barons who agreed to swear fealty to John only after they were promised restoration of what they alleged to be their rights. One of his claims was to twenty fees which Guy de Laval held of the honour of Pontefract, a claim which was realized by 1203. Between 25 August and 6 December 1199 Lacy attended John in Normandy, Maine, Touraine, and Poitou, and on 23 September 1199 was installed as castellan of Chinon. In the same year he recovered his castle of Pontefract, which the king had retained. He was obliged to surrender his eldest son as a hostage, but from this time he remained in high favour with the new king. He was sent in October or November 1200 to escort William the Lion to Lincoln, and was present when the Scottish king did homage there to John on 22 November. In 1201 he was sent, with William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, in command of one hundred knights each, to check the assaults of the king's enemies on the borders of Normandy. In 1202 he was controlling shipping along the Seine, and in April 1203 he acted as surety for the loyalty of Earl Ranulf (III) of Chester. In 1203 he successfully proffered &pound;1000 for the custody of the land and heir of Richard de Montfichet.<br>
<br>In 1203 Philip Augustus of France besieged Lacy in the famous Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard, which he defended with incomparable fidelity for several months, and only surrendered through stress of famine on 6 March 1204. Matthew Paris relates that the French king, in recognition of his gallant defence, put him in free custody. Lacy was ransomed by John's assistance for &pound;1000. He was further rewarded by being made sheriff of Yorkshire and Cumberland, offices that he held until 1209. In the winter of 1204&#150;5, when northern England was on the verge of rebellion, he remained loyal to John, fortifying Carlisle, and in the spring of 1205 he helped to organize the host against a threatened French invasion. In the years that followed, Lacy was often in attendance upon the king, and was one of John's gambling partners. In 1205 he acquired the Lancashire barony of Penwortham after paying off the debts of its previous lord, Hugh Buissel. In 1210 he was dispatched with troops to restore order in the Welsh marches, and is said to have rescued Earl Ranulf of Chester who was besieged by the Welsh at Rhuddlan, Flintshire. His fierce raids against the Welsh are said to have earned him the name of &#145;Roger of Hell&#146;.<br>
<br>Lacy married Maud de Clere, sister of the treasurer of York Cathedral; they had at least two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15855/', "John de Lacy, earl of Lincoln")</script>, and Roger, and possibly a third son, Robert, who is said to have been appointed constable of Flamborough. Lacy's principal residences were at Pontefract (Yorkshire), Clitheroe (Lancashire), and Halton. He died on 1 October 1211 at Stanlaw Abbey, and was buried there. He was a benefactor of that abbey, and also of Byland, Fountains, Kirkstall, Kirkstead, Pontefract, Sallay, and Watton. He was described by Roger of Wendover as a &#145;great and warlike man&#146; and as a &#145;noble man and outstanding knight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, 2.8, 58).<br>
