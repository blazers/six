<span class="headword">Stephens,  William</span>  (1672&#150;1753), <span class="occ">politician and colonial official</span>, was born on 28 January 1672 at Bowcombe Manor, near Newport on the Isle of Wight, the eldest son of Sir William Stephens, baronet (<i>d</i>. 1697), the island's former lieutenant-governor, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry Hillary, a Dorset grazier. He was educated at Winchester College, at King's College, Cambridge (graduating BA in 1684 and MA in 1688), and in 1691 at the Middle Temple, though he later did not practise. In 1696 he married Mary, the daughter of the mining entrepreneur <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47961/', "Sir Richard Newdigate, second baronet")</script>, and his first wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bagot; the couple had seven sons and two daughters, four of whom survived their parents.<br>
<br>In 1702 Stephens entered parliament as MP for Newport. He represented the constituency for twenty years, gaining in time a reputation as an opponent of the Hanoverian administrations and as a possible tory sympathizer with the Jacobite cause. During this period he also served as a JP, a victualling commissioner in Cowes (from 1712), and a colonel in the Isle of Wight militia. At the general election of 1722 he was returned as member for Newtown; however, allegations of financial impropriety while victualling commissioner, coupled with the squandering of his inheritance and the subsequent sale of the family estate, meant that he failed to win re-election five years later.<br>
<br>Two years on Stephens gained a position in Scotland with the York Buildings Company through a recent friend, Colonel Samuel Horsey, MP and company director, but his period of impoverishment endured, prompting his return to London in 1734. Once more Horsey offered Stephens a new career opportunity as a surveyor of his grant of land on the Savannah River in South Carolina, and he went there in 1736 with his son Thomas. There he met General James Edward Oglethorpe, one of the founding trustees of the Georgia corporation's new colony, and he accompanied Oglethorpe to England. On the general's recommendation Stephens was appointed secretary for Georgia by the trustees, who, increasingly suspicious of Oglethorpe's activities, and in particular of his dilatory approach to reporting to the board, charged Stephens to deliver regular statements on the colony's fortunes. Stephens returned to America, reaching Savannah, Georgia, on 1 November 1737, where he lived until his move to a 500 acre estate, known as Beaulieu (or Bewlie), at the mouth of the Vernon River, 12 miles south of Savannah. The estate, the gift of the trustees, came, as Stephens put it, as a &#145;ray of light&#146; and enabled him to restore his reputation and atone for past mistakes in public life.<br>
<br>Stephens quickly realized that many of the problems facing settlers in Georgia stemmed from mistaken decisions, principally regarding land and slave holding and agricultural production, taken by the trustees. Initially sympathetic to the trustees' position, by 1738 Stephens urged the board to lift the restrictions, which were prompting many settlers to quit the colony for neighbouring South Carolina's plantation system. However, not all of the landholders' grievances, including the restrictions on slave ownership and the consumption of rum, were accepted by Stephens; his report <span class="italic">The State of the Province of Georgia</span> (1740) was criticized by many, including his son Thomas, for providing an overly optimistic depiction of colonial life. Further criticism of the trustees by way of a petition to George II and parliament prompted a partial repeal of the restrictions on rum but not on slave ownership; it also led to a breach between Stephens and his son, who led this latest set of complaints against his father's employers.<br>
<br>Between 1741 and 1743 Stephens was president of one of the two counties, Savannah, into which the trustees divided the colony. Following Oglethorpe's return to England, Stephens assumed control of both counties (Oglethorpe having presided over the second, Frederica) and took over the general's responsibilities for civil and military authority for the whole colony as its president and <i>de facto</i> governor. With the substitution of fee simple for tail male ownership of land (1743) and the legalization of slavery (1749), Stephens's presidency witnessed Georgia's transition from the philanthropic settlement intended by the trustees to a colony resembling South Carolina; other reforms during his presidency included the licensing of Native American traders through Savannah rather than Charles Town. Throughout this period Stephens maintained a journal (started in 1737 and ended in September 1749) which, initially intended for board trustees, became a valuable source for scholars of early Georgian colonial history.<br>
<br>Aged seventy-eight, Stephens relinquished the colony's presidency in 1750 and retired to his estate in April the following year. He died and was buried at Beaulieu in mid-August 1753. Six years later Thomas Stephens published a biography of his father. Stephens's early journals (1737&#150;40) were first published in the fourth volume of Allen D. Chandler's <span class="italic">Colonial Records of Georgia</span> (1906); those for the remaining years, edited by E. Merton Coulter, appeared in 1958&#150;9.<br>
