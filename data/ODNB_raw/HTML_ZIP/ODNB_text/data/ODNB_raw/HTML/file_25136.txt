<span class="headword">Seward,  Thomas</span>  (1708&#150;1790), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was one of at least three sons of John Seward of Badsey, Worcestershire, steward of Lord Windsor, and his wife, Mary. He was admitted a foundation scholar of Westminster School in February 1719. He was elected by the school to scholarships at Christ Church, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1727, but upon his rejection by both he became a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1731 and proceeded MA in 1734.<br>
<br>Seward was ordained priest on 20 May 1732 at Rochester, and served as rector of Llan-maes, Glamorgan (1733&#150;40). He was also a travelling tutor to Lord Charles Fitzroy, third son of the duke of Grafton, who died while on the tour in Italy in 1739. The duke of Grafton subsequently promised some preferment for Seward. He became rector of Eyam, Derbyshire, on 22 March 1740, and also of Kingsley, Staffordshire, on 2 April 1747 (having been presented by Lord and Lady Burlington); and on 30 April 1755 he was collated to the prebend of Pipa Parva in Lichfield Cathedral. In addition Seward was installed in the prebend of Lyme and Halstock in Salisbury Cathedral on 5 June 1755.<br>
<br>Seward had become a resident of the cathedral close at Lichfield in 1754, and he was acquainted with Dr Johnson, whom he used to entertain on his visits to Lichfield. Boswell described him as &#145;a genteel, well-bred, dignified clergyman, who had lived much in the great world&#146;  (Ashmun, 188); and he was recalled by another as &#145;a lovely man, of fine person and frank communicative spirit&#146;  (ibid., 189). He had active literary interests and four of his poems were printed anonymously in Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">A Collection of Poems</span> (1748). Seward was the joint editor of an edition of the works of Beaumont and Fletcher which appeared in ten volumes in 1750. This did not meet with the later approbation of S. T. Coleridge, however, who wrote in his lectures on Shakespeare: &#145;Mr Seward! Mr Seward! You may be, and I trust you are, an angel, but you were an ass!&#146;  (Ashmun, 189). In 1779 Seward was portrayed as the canon in the novel <i>Columella</i> by Richard Graves.<br>
<br>Writing to Mrs Thrale in 1783 Dr Johnson commented that &#145;Seward called on me yesterday. He is going &hellip; to Paris and then to Flanders to contemplate the pictures of Claude Lorrain, and he asked me if that was not as good a way as any of spending time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Piozzi, 2.263). Mrs Thrale replied, &#145;I see no harm in his resolution &hellip; though the manner of expressing it was likely to offend you: yet he is not a man whom anyone can reproach with neglect of duty; he does more good than almost any person of twice his fortune&#146;  (ibid., 2.265). He was indeed assiduous in the performance of his prebendal duties.<br>
<br>Seward married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1780), daughter of the Revd John Hunter, headmaster of Lichfield grammar school, on 27 October 1741. They had a son and several daughters, but only Anna and Sarah survived infancy. Their eldest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25135/', "Anna Seward (1742&#150;1809)")</script>, &#145;the swan of Lichfield&#146;, was especially precocious, and her father declared that she could repeat passages from Milton's <span class="italic">L'Allegro</span> before she was three. Anna's poetic talent was nurtured by the literary milieu in which she grew up. Erasmus Darwin, for example, was a friend of the family. After her mother's death in 1780 Anna devoted herself to the care of her father.<br>
<br>In Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> (1791), Johnson described Seward as a man who not only had an ambition to be &#145;a fine talker&#146;, but was a &#145;valetudinarian&#146;, adding, &#145;I do not know a more disagreeable character than a valetudinarian&#146;  (Ashmun, 189). Anna Seward took issue with this view of her deceased father, and secured a more favourable notice of his life in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for October 1794. In her own obituary in that magazine it was said that &#145;Mr Seward had graceful manners, great hilarity of spirits, and active benevolence&#146;  (ibid., 190). However, some of the lack of appreciation of Seward by his contemporaries, like Johnson and Horace Walpole, probably sprang from a certain lightness of touch. He once said of two young men concerning his daughter: &#145;If she can be in danger from &#151;&#151; she must be infinitely more seducible to escape by any possible restraints parental prudence can impose&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Seward</span>, 1.267).<br>
<br>Thomas Seward died at the bishop's palace, Lichfield, on 4 March 1790 and was buried in the cathedral close. His daughter erected a monument in memory of her parent, in Lichfield Cathedral; the verses which formed part of the epitaph were composed by Sir Walter Scott.<br>
