<span class="headword">Oglethorpe,  Owen</span>  (1502/3&#150;1559), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was the third son of George Oglethorpe of Newton Kyme, near Tadcaster, Yorkshire. In 1551 he was said to be forty-eight. Educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, Oglethorpe for most of his life was connected to the college and involved with academic and ecclesiastical politics. Already a fellow in 1524, he graduated BA in 1525 and MA in 1529, when he became a lecturer in logic. Lecturer in moral philosophy in 1534, he proceeded BTh and DTh in February and July 1536 respectively. In the same February began his long presidency of his college. In 1531 he was master of disputations, and in 1533&#150;4 both keeper of the Winton Chest and junior proctor. In 1542 he became canon and prebendary of King Henry VIII College, holding the post until its dissolution in 1545, and still being in receipt of the pension at Pole's investigation in 1556. Vice-chancellor elect in 1551, his university career was now under a cloud because of his religious conservatism, and he was compelled to resign his presidency in September 1552, resuming it under Mary in October 1553, and finally vacating it in April 1555 to become registrar of the Order of the Garter in May 1555.<br>
<br>Oglethorpe's tenure of benefices followed a pattern familiar to such senior ecclesiastics. Priested in June 1531, a month later he was presented to the college living of Sele, Sussex, which he vacated by September 1536, and in 1534 to Bolton Percy, Yorkshire. He became a canon of Lincoln, with the prebend of Lafford, in 1536, only vacating on his elevation to Carlisle in 1556. He obtained the rectory of Newington, Oxfordshire, in 1537, which he vacated by 1557, and that of East Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, in 1538, in which year he had a dispensation to hold a second benefice. Canon and prebendary of St George's, Windsor (1540&#150;4), he was canon also of Ripon and prebendary first of Nunwick (1541&#150;4) and thereafter of Monkton. At the same period he gained other Yorkshire benefices: his native Newton Kyme in February 1541, and Romaldkirk in October 1541, obtaining in 1557 a dispensation to hold the latter <i>in commendam</i> with his bishopric. His rectory of St Olave's, Southwark (October 1544), was however vacated on his elevation to Carlisle. Not surprisingly 1544 saw dispensations, citing him as king's chaplain, to hold a third and fourth benefice. He hoped for the archdeaconry of the East Riding on the death of Thomas Magnus in 1550, but college politics prevented his obtaining it. Finally he became dean of St George's, Windsor, in February 1554, which he vacated by November 1556, and bishop of Carlisle, to which he was consecrated on 15 August 1556.<br>
<br>Oglethorpe's career was beset by religious change. Under Henry VIII he suffered the loss of a canonry during the uncertainties over Cardinal College, although he had been one of the seventeen commissioners of 1540 to answer the &#145;Seventeen Questions&#146; on the sacraments. His doctrinal position being well known, his conservatism was apt to cause him problems during Edward's reign. Tentative contacts with reformers did not save him from dissension in his college, where a radical minority sought to obtain a more sympathetic president. In November 1548 the president and fellows of Magdalen wrote to Somerset, defending themselves against the accusations of some reforming fellows that Oglethorpe had dissuaded them from accomplishing redress of religion, just as he had done at King Henry VIII College. Oglethorpe protested that he was protecting the college as he was bound by oath and statute to do, against changes for which he had no dispensation. He promised obedience to the protector, knowing that he would order nothing that was ungodly, and assured Somerset that the order of communion, not high mass, was in use at Magdalen, and that he had not expelled any dissentient fellow or scholar. This rather spineless conservatism seems characteristic of the man, and won him no friends. By September 1550 others were deliberately undermining him, suggesting then that someone of &#145;sincerer piety&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1547&#150;53</i>) should be chosen for ecclesiastical preferment, and in 1551 that Oglethorpe was in desperate need of the fellows' support if he were not to lose his presidency, and that he would forgo a major benefice (the archdeaconry) for the sake of the college. The writer thought his motivation not love but lucre, and believed the college to be split two to one in Oglethorpe's favour.<br>
<br>By 1552 Oglethorpe had given up the struggle: Cecil's notebook records him as content to surrender his house to the king's visitation in July, and in August an indenture of the terms on which he handed over to his successor preceded his departure. In the circumstances it is surprising to find Oglethorpe in correspondence with Bullinger, and mentioned in reformers' correspondence. A fulsome introductory letter of 1548 was followed by a reference in a letter of 1550 to Rudolph Gwalter to &#145;your friend Oglethorpe&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>) being in prison for superstition, and about to lose his presidency. In the same year he is joined with Peter Martyr in affectionate salutations to Bullinger, and in 1552 there is word of Dr Oglethorpe, vice-chancellor, anxiously expecting a letter from Bullinger. Foxe likewise records Oglethorpe in 1552 as having recanted his former ignorance at the preaching of Peter Martyr. His next mention of Oglethorpe, however, is as a disputant with the Oxford martyrs, dwelling in detail on the largely grammatical argument with Cranmer over whether the body of Christ was figuratively or literally present in the bread. Oglethorpe's promotions by Mary, in the light of such expressed theological views, are not surprising.<br>
<br>In July 1556 a licence was granted to the dean and chapter of Carlisle to elect a successor to Robert Aldridge; in October a grant of the temporalities was made to Owen Oglethorpe, dean of St George's, Windsor. But it was not until January 1558 that he was in full possession, as a result of papal provision to the see. The Marian gift of the advowson and collation to the four prebendal stalls in his cathedral, and, on 14 November 1558, of various Cumberland advowsons, not all within his diocese, should have put him in a position to act as a Catholic reforming bishop of Carlisle. The queen's death ended that hope, and Oglethorpe's episcopacy was effectively over before it ever truly began. In the absence of diocesan records for the period, only fragments remain to illustrate his work. Correspondence over a will shows him in the temporizing strain associated with his Oxford career, but at least resident in his diocese. The weak and shuffling reply which the bishop gave when questioned about the sale of plate at St George's, Windsor, seems typical. Likewise his consecration of a chapelry on his way south to Elizabeth's coronation simply shows a diocesan carrying out his regular duties. His pastoral role is unquantifiable.<br>
<br>The focal point of Oglethorpe's episcopal career was not his diocese, but his celebration of the Christmas eucharist, and participation in the coronation, of Elizabeth I. On Christmas day the queen walked out in displeasure at his elevation of the Host at the mass. The balance of probabilities is against his celebrating the mass at the coronation. That he should have been the officiating bishop at her coronation was largely accidental. With the see of Canterbury vacant, and York and his aged deputy at Durham infirm, Oglethorpe was the only remaining bishop of the northern province. There was perhaps some difficulty in finding any bishop not so closely connected to the previous regime as to be tarnished by it. The coronation robes had to be borrowed from Bonner of London, a great point being made of there being the full regalia, and all done in due order: &#145;universum apparatum pontificium quo uti solent Episcopi in huiusmodi magnificis illustrissimorum regum inaugurationibus&#146; (&#145;all the pontifical apparel which bishops are accustomed to wear at such occasions, the magnificent coronations of the most illustrious of kings&#146;; <span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1558&#150;70</i>, 42). Elizabeth was conscious of the service done her. When, in 1598, she wanted to flatter another bishop of Carlisle, she told him that she had been determined to appoint a worthy man to the see, for the sake of him who set the crown on her head  (<span class="italic">VCH Cumberland</span>, 2.60).<br>
<br>Though he must have been aware of the confessional commitment of the new queen, Oglethorpe seems to have been content to be obedient. Faced with inevitable deprivation, like other Catholic bishops he behaved with dignity, regularly attending sessions of the Lords in March to April 1559 and voting against the <span class="roman">Uniformity Bill</span>. He was assessed for a fine of &pound;250 in May 1559, and deprived of Carlisle in June, losing also his <i>commendam</i> of Romaldkirk, which went to his eventual successor in August.<br>
<br>Uncertain of his future, and the validity of any plans made in a more favourable regime, Oglethorpe drew up his will on 10 November 1559, principally concerned to secure the foundation of a grammar school and almshouse at Tadcaster, Yorkshire. Several elements are of interest. The introductory formula claims, like any committed protestant, that he trusts to be saved by the merits of his saviour Jesus Christ. Numerous personal bequests, some very generous, are made; his friend Cuthbert Scott, the late bishop of Chester and one of the supervisors of the will, was to have a valuable cup and &#145;the ringe with thre diamonde on my finger&#146;. Ample provision was made for the establishment and endowment of his school. What he hoped to be called Christ's Hospital, for twelve old people and as many scholars, is described in considerable architectural detail, with &pound;500 allocated for its construction. Lands and tenements to the annual value of &pound;40 were to be purchased for its upkeep, and a generous salary of 20 marks allotted to the schoolmaster. Even the quality of its intended occupants is specified. Numerous Oglethorpes were bound in the sum of &pound;1000 to see the work completed  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/43, fols. 221&#150;3). Tadcaster grammar school survived until 1968, and its successor preserved, at the close of the twentieth century, the proud memory of its founding bishop. A typical medieval prelate, conservative, primarily an academic, Oglethorpe died suddenly on 31 December 1559 after some months of house arrest in London, and was buried on 6 January 1560 at St Dunstan-in-the-West.<br>
