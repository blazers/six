<span class="headword">Steel, Sir  David Edward Charles</span>  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">oil company executive</span>, was born on 29 November 1916 at 5 Overstrand Mansions, Battersea, London, the second son of Gerald Arthur Steel, private secretary to the first lord of the Admiralty, and his wife, Ellen Price, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards. His father later entered business and became general manager of the British Aluminium Company. David Steel was the third generation of his family to be educated at Rugby School, and went on to read jurisprudence at University College, Oxford. At both, he was a keen sportsman, playing cricket and rugby. Having graduated from Oxford with a second-class degree in 1938, he embarked on solicitor's articles with the London firm Slaughter and May and played rugby for the Harlequins club. When the Second World War broke out he was commissioned in the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, a tank regiment. He was sent to France, where his brother, also a 9th lancer, was killed in action. Steel had a reputation for fearlessness, but his bravery was matched by his modesty, and he was reticent about his meritorious wartime exploits, which won him the DSO (1940) for his part in the rearguard action following the Dunkirk evacuation, the Military Cross (1945) as part of the Eighth Army in northern Italy, and three mentions in dispatches. After the war he resumed his articles with the London firm of solicitors, Linklaters and Paines, qualifying as a solicitor in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1950, in a career move that would define his future, Steel joined the newly formed legal department of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, one of the small band of major western oil companies which dominated the international oil industry. He could not have joined at a more crucial juncture. While Anglo-Iranian was coming unstuck in Iran, where its assets were nationalized by Mohammed Mussadeq in 1951, Steel quickly found his feet in his new working environment. Apart from his legal skills, his other qualities quickly shone through, in particular his exceptional diligence, conscientiousness, and all-round abilities as a team player. His potential to advance to the top of the company (renamed British Petroleum (BP) in 1954) was quickly spotted, and he soon moved on from legal work to a succession of general management posts in Britain, America, and the Middle East, becoming president of BP North America in 1959 and managing director of the Kuwait Oil Company in 1962. As he moved around the world and made his way up the company hierarchy, Steel found great happiness in family life after his marriage in 1956 to Ann Wynne Price (<i>d</i>. 1997), daughter of a Canadian army officer, C. B. Price. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>After Steel joined BP's main board of directors in 1965, his attention was devoted increasingly to high-level oil diplomacy, in which he demonstrated the combination of patience, tact, and firmness that was his hallmark. He personally led a series of tense negotiations with the shah of Iran, whose demands on the oil companies threatened to destabilize their lucrative oil concessions in the Middle East. In 1972 Steel climbed still further up the corporate ladder, becoming the company's deputy chairman, and in 1975 he was appointed chairman and chief executive.<br>
<br>Steel inherited the top job at BP at a time when the company was in the throes of transition. Most of BP's rich oil concessions in the Middle East had by then been nationalized by the increasingly assertive producing countries, and BP's future in the oil industry looked insecure. But Steel had two aces up his sleeve. One was the company's large stake in the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska, which came on stream in 1977, the year that Steel was knighted. The other was BP's interest in North Sea oil, in which Harold Wilson's Labour government, which was then BP's major shareholder, demanded increased state participation. The encounters between the mild-mannered capitalist, Steel, and the outspoken socialist, Tony Benn, who was secretary of state for energy, were among the most memorable moments in Steel's career, as he succeeded in virtually neutering state participation, as well as warding off Benn's demands for increased state control over BP. This was Steel's greatest achievement at the helm of BP. He proved less successful in other initiatives, particularly attempts to diversify BP into non-oil businesses such as coal, minerals, and computing. Indeed, while Steel excelled in political and diplomatic skills, he lacked the commercial instincts of more intuitive businessmen. Throughout his career, he remained a great believer in consensus, a company man whose concern for staff welfare, sense of fair play, and sheer decency, deservedly won him the loyalty of colleagues. It was for these qualities, rather than his business acumen, that he was admired. He was, in essence, a gentlemanly capitalist.<br>
<br>Steel's retirement from BP in 1981 was in that sense timely, for he would not have been comfortable with the world of mass redundancies, hostile takeovers, and corporate restructurings which came to the fore in the 1980s. He remained, nevertheless, active as a director of the Bank of England (1978&#150;85) and Kleinwort Benson (1985&#150;92), as president of the London Chamber of Commerce (1982&#150;5), and chairman of the Mermaid Theatre, London. Between 1982 and 1989 he was chairman of the Wellcome Trust and in 1986 took the controversial and much contested decision to float the pharmaceutical business on the stock market in order to secure the trust's wealth; a subsequent takeover saw the Wellcome Trust's assets increase to &pound;15 billion. He died on 9 August 2004 at the Lister Hospital, Westminster, following a stroke, and was survived by his three children.<br>
