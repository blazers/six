<span class="headword">Cassels, Sir  (Archibald) James Halkett</span>  (1907&#150;1996), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Quetta, India, on 28 February 1907, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32324/', "General Sir Robert Archibald Cassels (1876&#150;1959)")</script>, army officer, and his wife, Florence Emily, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Halkett Jackson. Jim Cassels, as he was invariably known, was educated at Rugby School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he won the sword of honour. He was commissioned second lieutenant in the Seaforth Highlanders in 1926. In 1930 (having been promoted lieutenant the previous year) he served with the 2nd battalion at Jhansi and then took part in operations in the North-West Frontier Province on the Khajauri plain. He moved with the battalion to Haifa in 1931, was appointed adjutant, and was involved in the Arab disturbance of 1933. In 1934 he returned to England but soon went back to India to become aide-de-camp to his father, first when the latter was general officer commanding, northern command, and later when he was commander-in-chief of the army of India. On 29 October 1935 he married Joyce Emily (<i>d</i>. 1978), daughter of the late Brigadier-General Henry Kirk, and his wife, Mrs G. A. McL. Sceales, of Clifts End Hall, Thanet, Kent; they had one son, Robert James (<i>b</i>. 1941).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1939 Cassels (who had been promoted captain the previous year) was at the regimental depot on the Moray Firth; from here he was posted to the Staff College, Camberley, in 1940 for the wartime course. He then saw a short period of active service in France where he was appointed brigade major to Brigadier Sir John Laurie of 157th infantry brigade, in the 52nd Lowland division, which was sent to France after the Dunkirk evacuation. The aim of this operation was to assist the French to hold a line along the Somme and the Aisne against the advancing Panzers. However, the French regarded the position as hopeless and surrendered, leaving the 157th brigade to fight its way back to Cherbourg, from where it was lucky to be evacuated on 17 June 1940.<br>
<br>Between 1940 and 1944 Cassels held a number of staff appointments but in June 1944 he took command of the 152nd infantry brigade, 51st Highland division, on the beachhead east of the River Orne. He led the brigade with distinction, liberating St Val&eacute;ry, capturing Le Havre, and taking it through the operations in the Netherlands, the Ardennes battle, the Rhine crossing, and the final advance into Germany. He was made DSO and was mentioned twice in dispatches. In 1945 he was promoted temporary major-general commanding the 51st Highland division, which was then occupying the Bremen district. In 1946 he took command of the 6th airborne division, which was sent to Palestine to engage in anti-terrorist duties, where he was again mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>In 1947 Cassels attended the course at the Imperial Defence College (IDC) and in 1948 he became director of land/air warfare at the War Office, with the full rank of major-general. This was followed by a year as chief liaison officer, UK liaison staff, in Australia. His next assignment was to form and command the 1st British Commonwealth division in Korea in 1951. The division consisted of troops from Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but was quickly welded by him into an excellent fighting formation. Cassels's informal style, combined with his habit of visiting soldiers in forward, isolated positions, made him extremely popular and successful. He was awarded the American Legion of Merit. In 1953 he became commander of 1st (British) corps in Germany, and after returning to England in 1954 (when he was promoted lieutenant-general) he was director-general of military training (1954&#150;7). He was then appointed director of emergency operations in the Federation of Malaya, a post he held for two years, and in which he was noted for his perception and drive in bringing the operations to a successful conclusion.<br>
<br>Having been promoted general in 1958, Cassels was general officer commanding, eastern command (1959&#150;60); commander-in-chief, British army of the Rhine and commander, NATO northern army group (1960&#150;63); adjutant-general to the forces (1963&#150;4); and chief of the general staff (1965&#150;8). He was promoted field marshal on retirement in 1968. His period as chief of the general staff came at a particularly difficult time for, although the Soviet forces greatly outnumbered those of the West in men, guns, tanks, and aircraft, the British government was determined to cut down on defence expenditure. At the same time Cassels was convinced that some members of the House of Commons regarded the expansion of Soviet power as no threat to Britain and were even prepared to assist the Russians, openly or secretly, but as his information about Soviet intentions and domestic subversion was classified he was unable to reveal it. He was unable to prevent drastic reductions in the Territorial Army and the truncation or amalgamation of regiments of the regular army. He was also unable to prevent Britain's being weakened by the loss of aircraft-carriers, and by inadequate provision for the future of the RAF. Nevertheless his influence and prestige undoubtedly prevented much more damaging reductions. He also helped restrain the government from precipitate actions such as military intervention against the declaration of independence in Rhodesia.<br>
<br>Tall and good-looking, Cassels was an inspiring commander, who could be stern when necessary, but was popular with troops owing to his cheerfulness and approachability. An enthusiast for what was then called &#145;dance music&#146;, he would often enliven the mess by singing the latest tune to the accompaniment of his own guitar. He also played the clarinet. An exceptional all-round sportsman in his youth, Cassels played cricket, fives, and rugby football for Rugby for several years and continued to show outstanding sporting prowess at Sandhurst. He was a good shot and a skilled fisherman, and a first-class polo player, cricketer, and golfer; he was a member of the MCC committee and president of the company of veteran motorists.<br>
<br>Cassels was appointed CBE in 1944, CB in 1950, KBE in 1952, and GCB in 1961. His first wife, Joyce, died in 1978, and later that year he married Joy, widow of Kenneth Dickson. Cassels died in Newmarket on 13 December 1996, and was survived by his second wife and the son of his first marriage.<br>
