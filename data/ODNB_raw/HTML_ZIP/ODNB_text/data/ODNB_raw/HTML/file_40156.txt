</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Haley, Sir  William John</span>  (1901&#150;1987), <span class="occ">broadcasting executive and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 24 May 1901 in St Helier, Jersey, the son of Frank Haley of Bramley, Leeds (who died when Haley was two years old), and Marie Berthe Sangan, a Jersey Frenchwoman. French-speaking until the age of five, he was educated at Victoria College, Jersey, but left school at sixteen and served as a wireless telegraph operator on a tramp ship during the last two years of the First World War. He was inspired to become a journalist, he later said, after reading Philip Gibbs's <span class="italic">The Street of Adventure</span>, and after a short period at a Jersey weekly, in 1919 he joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a shorthand copy-taker in the foreign news department. There he met Edith Susie Gibbons, secretary to the foreign editor, whom he married in 1921. On his suggestion the newspaper sent them to Brussels, where Haley successfully reorganized the paper's European news-gathering operation. He also contributed a freelance weekly letter from Brussels to the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span>, on the strength of which he was offered a job as a reporter in 1922.<h2>
<a name="Newspapereditor"></a>Newspaper editor</h2>Haley, a deeply shy man, was not a success as a reporter and was soon moved to sub-editing, where he excelled. He was promoted to chief sub-editor in 1925, and in 1930 was appointed both managing editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> and a director of its parent company, Manchester Guardian and Evening News Ltd. His task was to develop the paper to withstand the increasingly competitive evening newspaper market of the 1930s. As managing editor Haley proved a brilliant newspaper technician with an instinct for popular journalism, and demonstrated the single-minded and austere professionalism that would become his defining characteristic. Reserved in manner, he was forceful, even ruthless, in both business dealings and moral judgements. He led by example, working the longest hours of any of his staff, maintaining a desk in every department, and constantly checking every aspect of production. His own office had no chair, just a standing desk, where he revised proofs and lunched on a bun and a glass of milk. A large man with a resemblance to G. K. Chesterton, he had no social life beyond the office and his young family of four children. He was a non-smoker and almost teetotal, joined no clubs or social organizations, and repelled all attempts at workplace friendships (though he did permit himself twenty minutes of ping-pong each evening&#151;he was office champion&#151;and the occasional game of golf). Despite the considerable financial constraints under which the newspaper operated, Haley ensured the reputation of the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> as one of the leading evening papers in the country. He also managed to pursue in print his passionate love of literature (particularly Victorian literature), writing a weekly book review column under the pseudonym Joseph Sell (the name itself a literary allusion, to Borrow). To his fellow journalist A. P. Ryan these books took the place of the comradeship Haley's life lacked.<br>
<br>The Spanish Civil War politicized Haley's editorial journalism. His leader articles for the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> became far more hard-hitting, in particular his denunciation of the bombing of Guernica (&#145;the bombs of Guernica may be the forerunners of our doom&#146;) and of the Munich agreement, which the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> opposed in the strongest moral terms. On the outbreak of the Second World War J. R. Scott, manager of Manchester Guardian and Evening News Ltd, appointed Haley joint managing director, and with his success at the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> having helped save the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> from closure he was made one of the original Scott trustees. From 1939 to 1943 he was also a director of the Press Association and of Reuters. He became a director of the Reuters Trust on its establishment in 1941, and travelled to the USA and Australia on its behalf to negotiate new news-gathering agreements. His success here, where so many had failed before, spread his reputation well beyond Manchester. He was by now, however, suffering from a severely debilitating form of anaemia, as yet undiagnosed. This caused a drastic weight loss that dramatically altered his appearance.<h2>
<a name="Wartimebroadcasting"></a>Wartime broadcasting</h2>In 1943 Haley, after some initial doubts, accepted the newly created post of editor-in-chief at the BBC. The increased importance of broadcasting during the war had placed enormous strain on the relationship between the BBC and the government, and the new post (which ranked barely below that of director-general) was designed specifically to bring high-level journalistic expertise into the corporation as well as to strengthen leadership at the top. Haley's faith in the value of public service broadcasting, and his uncompromising belief that the BBC should provide the best possible of whatever it broadcast, echoed that of the first BBC director-general, John Reith, and Haley brought to the BBC the same single-minded conviction. With his illness now successfully diagnosed and treated, he proved both a successful administrator and a tireless defender of the corporation. His first task as editor-in-chief was to visit the Italian battle front to discuss BBC provision with British servicemen and BBC war correspondents; this led to the launch of the BBC's new General Forces Programme (amalgamating the domestic Forces Programme and the General Overseas Service that had previously provided programmes for servicemen abroad), which both saved the BBC money and, by providing a single forces service for soldiers abroad and their families in Britain, raised morale. The renewed sense of confidence at the BBC in the last part of the war was in no small part due to Haley's decisiveness and clarity of purpose&#151;as well as to the cordial and trusting relationship he developed with the minister of information, Brendan Bracken. In 1944 he was the natural choice to succeed Robert Foot as director-general.<h2>
<a name="DirectorgeneraloftheBBC"></a>Director-general of the BBC</h2>After the end of the war Haley reshaped the post-war BBC. His reorganization of the corporation in 1947 was the most wide-ranging since 1933, recentralizing important aspects of its administration and creating a new central board of management, which historians later came to consider one of the most important institutional developments in the BBC's history. He also set his stamp on the corporation's post-war output. No director-general since Reith had believed so forcefully in the cultural importance of broadcasting, but Haley recognized the need to maintain the BBC's wartime popularity even while answering widespread criticism that the wartime BBC had become too populist. To this end he oversaw the redesignation of the two wartime BBC wavelengths as the Light Programme and Home Service, and was the driving force behind the launch in 1946 of the Third Programme, a new service specifically devoted to high culture, music, and the arts. It was Haley who coined the image of the post-war BBC as a cultural pyramid, whereby listeners, attracted first to the populist Light Programme, might progress gradually upwards via the middlebrow Home Service to the summit of the resolutely &eacute;litist Third Programme. In many respects the Third Programme was typical of Haley himself. Quixotically highbrow, even on its inception it was looked on by many as a Reithian anachronism at the heart of the BBC's modernization programme. Yet it offered unprecedented scope for innovation and experiment, gave opportunity to a new generation of musicians and literary figures, and made classical music, literature, and the arts available to all who cared to listen. Praised and mocked in equal measure, often attracting only tiny audiences, the Third Programme nevertheless represented an essential facet of the BBC's <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> as a public service institution: the provision of high culture for its own sake and in disregard of merely commercial imperatives. It survived until 1967, when it was subsumed into BBC Radio 3.<br>
<br>In common with most other BBC executives, Haley considered television (which began re-broadcasting in 1946 after its wartime suspension) as secondary in importance to radio. In part, this was because he recognized television's innately populist appeal and feared that, left unchecked, it would come to dominate the home; however, his relative neglect of the BBC's television service in favour of the &#145;spoken word&#146; alienated more forward-looking staff members (some of whom&#151;notably Norman Collins&#151;left the BBC to help set up commercial television). Haley fought the creation of commercial television in the early 1950s, fearing it would inexorably undermine broadcasting values and standards. Although his achievements at the BBC were singled out for praise by the Beveridge committee on broadcasting in 1950, when he left the BBC in 1952 he knew that the battle to maintain the BBC's monopoly had been lost.<h2>
<a name="EditorofTheTimes"></a>Editor of The Times</h2>In 1952 Sir William Haley (he had been appointed KCMG in 1946 as well as being appointed to the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1948) succeeded William Casey as editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Here, as at the BBC in 1943, morale was low. Newsprint was still rationed, and <span class="italic">The Times</span> in particular struggled to maintain its role as the newspaper of record, hampered in addition by outdated working practices and staff tensions between the &#145;gentlemen&#146; (specialist commentators) and &#145;players&#146; (journalists). Although Haley was hardly a revolutionary, over the next fourteen years he changed <span class="italic">The Times</span> from a moribund national institution into (in the words of Lord Beaverbrook) a &#145;real newspaper&#146;. He fought successfully to end newsprint rationing, and used the space gained for far wider coverage of the arts and of women's features. He introduced cartoons and a corrections column to the newspaper. He challenged the Oxbridge and public-school tone of much of the paper, and brought in more professional journalists. He presided over the replacement of <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s Victorian offices with a modern open-plan working environment. In May 1966 he made history by returning news to the front page for the first time in nearly two centuries. However, he continued to devote considerable space to obscure and erudite topics, and resisted any attempt to change the newspaper's long-standing tradition of anonymous journalism, despite the difficulties this caused in retaining some of his best journalists. (It was left to his successor as editor, William Rees-Mogg, to institute this long-overdue change in 1967.) Haley's one personal indulgence was his own renewed weekly literary column, written on his one day off a week under the new pseudonym Oliver Edwards. Its eclecticism attracted a certain amount of derision from the younger literati, but it eloquently expressed his own love of reading.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Haley sought to break the long-standing perception that <span class="italic">The Times</span> was the newspaper of the establishment. He sought to distance the paper from Whitehall and the City. He brought a new scepticism and independence to its reporting of government, for example famously publishing a report about the stationing of US Polaris submarines in Scotland, in defiance of the Ministry of Defence and 10 Downing Street. He discouraged sycophancy towards royalty (and always personally referred to the duke of Edinburgh as &#145;that young man who looks like a soda syphon&#146;). Characteristically, he deplored <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s (highly successful) advertising campaign &#145;Top people take <span class="italic">The Times</span>&#146;, and insisted on the inclusion of scientists and engineers as well as bishops, judges, and generals in the advertisements. Above all, he restored a passionate moral tone to <span class="italic">Times</span> leaders. His editoral philosophy was eloquently summed up in his last speech before his retirement from the paper:<blockquote>The truth is that there is a difference between right and wrong &hellip; no half-way house between honesty and dishonesty &hellip; things which are bad and false and ugly and no amount of argument or specious casuistry will make them good or true or beautiful. It is time that these things were said, and time for the Press to say them.</blockquote>Haley's leading article on 11 June 1963 at the height of the Profumo affair, &#145;It is a moral issue&#146;, became a historic indictment of the Macmillan government (whom he considered a &#145;bunch of thugs&#146;). A &#145;Manchester Liberal&#146; by inclination, he supported the Conservative Party in all elections, but regretted that the Liberal Party was not stronger. His moral outlook shaped his attitude to government policies: he supported the move towards colonial change in Africa, for instance, and (cautiously) endorsed Britain's quest for membership of the EEC.<br>
<br>Throughout his tenure at <span class="italic">The Times</span> Haley remained the unclubbable, distant, and driven figure he had been at the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> and the BBC. He was an exacting taskmaster (&#145;Working fourteen to sixteen hours a day himself, Haley cannot understand why others wilt after twelve hours&#146;, said one executive), rarely took holidays, kept a close eye on every part of the newspaper, and could be harshly unforgiving of mistakes, though protective of his staff against unjustified criticism from outside. As before, he discouraged personal relationships with his staff (he never, apparently, addressed any employee by his or her Christian name), and avoided social occasions. He was a wooden public speaker. Yet he inspired fierce loyalties among many of his staff. His relaxations were reading (an estimated three Victorian novels a week) and listening to music. He accumulated many honours, including several honorary degrees, and from 1955 to 1962 was president of the National Book League.<h2>
<a name="Lateyears"></a>Late years</h2>In his last years at <span class="italic">The Times</span> Haley was principally concerned with business matters. In 1965 he became chief executive and director of the Times Publishing Company Ltd, but was unable to resolve the economic crisis that hit the entire newspaper industry in this period and especially <span class="italic">The Times</span>. At one point he entered into talks with Alistair Hetherington, then editor of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, to consider a merger. However, in 1966 Haley oversaw instead the change of proprietorship from the Astor family to the Thomson organization (owners of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>), serving as the first chairman of Times Newspapers Ltd in 1967. In 1968&#150;9 he left <span class="italic">The Times</span> to become editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, based in Chicago, but his plans for the new edition were opposed and the appointment was short-lived. He retired to Jersey, where he acted as the island's commissioner of appeal for income tax (1971&#150;83) and chairman of the Jersey Arts Council (1976&#150;7), and continued to read and to review until a debilitating attack of shingles when he was eighty curtailed this lifelong pleasure. Sir William Haley died in a nursing home in Jersey on 6 September 1987, aged eighty-six, and was buried in Gouray churchyard, Jersey. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Sir William Haley's contribution to the mass media in twentieth-century Britain was profound. Yet, despite holding two of the most powerful posts in the British media, he was a self-effacing figure whose public profile never matched that of, for instance, John Reith, or C. P. Scott. To most who worked for him Haley remained an enigma: an outstanding modernizer whose inspiration was his uncompromising Victorian conscience; the man who took broadcasting into the second half of the twentieth century but whose passion was the literature of the nineteenth, who left school at sixteen but rose to edit the most celebrated newspaper in the English-speaking world.<br>
