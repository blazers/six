</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Loch,  James</span>  (1780&#150;1855), <span class="occ">lawyer and estate commissioner</span>, was born on 7 May 1780 at Drylaw, near Edinburgh, the eldest son of George Loch (1749&#150;1788), landowner, and his wife, Mary Adam. His mother was daughter of John Adam of Blair, Kinross-shire, and sister of lord chief-commissioner William Adam, of the jury court. The Drylaw estate had to be sold in 1786, and Loch was one of seven children who were all under eight years of age when their father died. He was brought up at Blair Adam estate under the care of his uncle, where he learned most of his knowledge about agriculture and estate administration.<br>
<br>Loch studied law in the rationalist milieu of Edinburgh University and was much influenced by the philosophy of Adam Smith through the teaching of Dugald Stewart. He was at the centre of a glittering circle of students and was a member of the Speculative Society in 1798 and its president in the following two years. He was admitted as advocate in Scotland in 1801 and called to the English bar in Lincoln's Inn on 15 November 1806. Abandoning law after a few years of conveyancing practice, he worked as private secretary to George Tierney at the India board. He was involved in political activity and wrote a provocative article for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in 1804. A vigorous and effective worker in the interest of the whig party, he was offered entr&eacute;e to a political career but made a clear decision, as early as 1810, to abandon politics and follow his vocation in the management of landed estates.<br>
<br>In August 1812 Loch became estate commissioner of the marquess of Stafford (first duke of Sutherland in the year of his death in 1833), whose estates represented the greatest accumulation of wealth in Britain at that time. Subsequently Loch supervised the estates of the second duke, and the duchess of Sutherland. He was also auditor and adviser to Lord Francis Egerton, afterwards earl of Ellesmere; to the Bridgewater trustees; to the earl of Carlisle; to the trust estates of the earl of Dudley (from which he was discharged on account of his support for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>); and to Viscount Keith. He was responsible for estate policies over large parts of England and Scotland, which made him remarkably influential in the improvement and modernization of agricultural and industrial property across Victorian Britain.<br>
<br>Loch was married first in 1810, to Ann (<i>d</i>. January 1842), youngest daughter of Patrick Orr of Bridgeton, Kincardineshire. They had nine children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16881/', "Granville Gower Loch")</script>; his sons were involved mainly in service to the empire in India and beyond, notably <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16882/', "Henry Brougham Loch")</script>, who was much respected as governor of both Victoria and of the Cape and also served as high commissioner for South Africa. Loch married second, on 2 December 1847, Elizabeth Mary, widow of George Macartney Grevill, of the 38th foot, and eldest daughter of John Pearson of Tettenhall Wood, Staffordshire. His second wife predeceased him on 29 December 1849.<br>
<br>Loch was widely regarded as the finest barrister-auditor of his day, and he worked on almost equal terms with his aristocratic employers. The dowager duchess of Bedford was told that &#145;she could not possibly have a better or more able adviser&#146;  (Spring, 89). Loch's contemporary Ralph Sneyd described him as &#145;Loch the infallible&#146;  (ibid.). He was in great demand as an adviser on most matters. He gave evidence before the select committee on public works in Ireland in 1835. He was an expert in entail and family law. In all his administrative work he gave extraordinary attention to detail. On the Sutherland estates he regarded his task as maintaining the long-term position of the family, as opposed to short-term gains. He believed that the conservative strength of the aristocracy derived from its responsibility for the &#145;great sinews of improvement&#146;  (Richards, 26).<br>
<br>Loch's career was most publicly known for his part in the great and controversial changes implemented on the highland estates of the Sutherland family from 1812 onwards. The policy predated Loch but he gave it greater clarity and direction. He presided over some of the largest clearances and then spent much of his life in defence of the consequences. He believed that the highlands had been locked in feudal squalor and its people effectively enslaved under the old highland middlemen. They had been kept poor and were ravaged by recurrent famine. His mission was to release the resources of the highlands and open the region to trade and improvement. This meant the removal of the tacksmen, the introduction of commercial sheep-farming, and the relocation of the small tenantry to the coasts. His management of the Sutherland estate was excoriated as &#145;the Loch policy&#146; for its inhumanity to the people who were ousted from the inland districts and replaced by sheep. The removals often required strong-arm methods which generated widespread opprobrium. Since Loch became the principal apologist for the Sutherland clearances he also attracted much of the public abuse. None of this was diminished by his advocacy of emigration programmes to relieve population congestion in the west highlands. He attempted to deter improvident marriage and population growth by refusing to allow the subdivision of smallholdings.<br>
<br>Loch was much hurt by what he regarded as the &#145;lies&#146; told about the Sutherland highlanders. He was critical of the middle levels of the new highland society who gave too little leadership to the people at large. He published an account of the Sutherland policies in 1820 and a privately printed memoir of the duke of Sutherland in 1834. He travelled a great deal between the estates and visited Sutherland virtually every autumn. He centralized decision making for the estate as a whole and employed professional agents on the individual estates. Most of the evictions were over by 1830 but small evictions were still in train in the 1850s where tenants fell into arrears. Beneath Loch was an elaborate management structure with estate agents and sub-agents. They were instructed to comport themselves in a particular way since they<blockquote>must be the principal gentlemen of the district, capable of acting as a deputy Lt and JP, and be very kind and forbearing to a most worthy excellent set of poor tenants, who require to be much encouraged in their most praiseworthy exertions of improvement. (Loch to Lockhart, 24 March 1827, NL Scot., MS 926)</blockquote>During the course of his lifetime Loch held many public offices. These included being a director of the English Historical Society, seal keeper of the Old Quay Navigation Company, governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal, commissioner of the Caledonian and Crinan Canal, and director of the Grand Junction Railway. In addition he was active in scientific and educational circles, being elected a fellow of the Geological, Statistical, and Zoological societies; and he was a member of the committee of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. One of the founders of London University, for many years he served on its council and associated bodies. He was a director of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and of the Birmingham and Liverpool Canal. He also served in Scotland as commissioner of highland roads and bridges and as deputy lieutenant of Sutherland.<br>
<br>In 1827 Loch entered parliament for St Germains in Cornwall, in the whig interest, which he held until 1830; he was then returned without opposition for the Wick burghs. There he was regularly re-elected until 1852, when he was defeated by Samuel Laing (119 to 80 votes in a climacteric election). He regarded himself as one of the architects of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and was close to Lord John Russell during its passage. Although he worked for committees of the house, he declined more direct involvement in politics and government.<br>
<br>James Loch died on 28 June 1855 at his house at 12 Albemarle Street, London, and was buried in the Brompton cemetery. The duke of Sutherland erected a monument in his memory at Uppat (overlooking Dunrobin Castle), where he spent much of his time. An inscription on it praised Loch's &#145;virtuous labour for the land he loved&#146;  (P. G. Loch, 254). Loch's son George (1811&#150;1877) succeeded him in the Sutherland management.<br>
