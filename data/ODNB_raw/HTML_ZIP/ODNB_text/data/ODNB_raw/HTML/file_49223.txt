<span class="headword">Houston,  Ren&eacute;e</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Caterina Rita Murphy Gribbin]</span>  (1902&#150;1980), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 24 July 1902 at 55 Grahame Street, Johnstone, Renfrewshire, one of at least two daughters of James Gribbin (1876&#150;1939), then a spirit salesman, and his wife, Elizabeth Houston (1875&#150;1942). She later gave her maiden forenames as Katerina Valorita. Her parents, who billed themselves as James Houston and Company, became a well-known touring variety act combining comedy and song; the children lived with their grandmother in the small farming community of Carntyne, near Glasgow, where Ren&eacute;e Houston, as she was known from a child, attended the local convent school. By 1914 she had developed her own act, filling in for an absent comedian in the Fyfe and Fyfe Company. She described her three years with them as her &#145;theatrical education&#146;  (Houston, 21), playing a variety of roles, developing the coloratura voice she inherited from her mother, and learning Scottish dancing and ballet.<br>
<br>When her parents become ill on tour Ren&eacute;e replaced them with a double act she invented with her sister Billie. The Houston Sisters established themselves with comedy grounded in sibling rivalry, Billie playing the boy; they combined meticulous attention to detail, including furniture scaled up to make them look like toddlers, with almost tangible on-stage rapport that gave them improvisatory flair. They were both sharply observational about working-class Scottish life and childhood, and sexually magnetic. In 1926 they appeared at the royal command performance, and they were still successful when Billie retired owing to ill health in 1935. In 1923 Houston was married for the first time, her husband being George Balharrie; they adopted two sons but the marriage ended in divorce and on 28 November 1932 she married Patrick de Lacy Aherne (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), a film actor. They had a son and a daughter but that marriage, too, ended in divorce, in 1948. On 7 August that year she married the actor Donald Stewart (1909/10&#150;1974).<br>
<br>After the retirement of her sister, Houston subsequently developed an act with Donald Stewart. They performed in revue and pantomime, and in the first production of the 1959 play <span class="italic">Roar Like a Dove</span>, subsequently a Houston trademark; she was to play in six different productions. Her film career took off after the war and she played in several distinguished British films, in comedies such as <span class="italic">The Belles of St Trinian's</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Watch it, Sailor</span> (1961), and <span class="italic">Twice Round the Daffodils</span> (1961), and in dramas such as <span class="italic">The Horse's Mouth</span> (1959), <span class="italic">A Town Like Alice</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">Time without Pity</span> (1957). She also worked several times with the director Roman Polanski, notably on the experimental <span class="italic">Repulsion</span> in 1965, and was an occasional member of the informal company of British comic actors who appeared in the <span class="roman">Carry On</span> series, in <span class="italic">Carry on Cabby</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Carry on Spying</span> (1964), and <span class="italic">Carry on at your Convenience</span> (1971). In 1963, while continuing with stage, film, and television work, she began a radio career in <span class="italic">Petticoat Line</span>, a lighter version of <span class="italic">The Brains Trust</span> in which a female panel discussed listeners' questions. The show made good use of her talent for the spontaneous and her ability to interact with panellists such as Barbara Cartland and Rachel Heyhoe Flint to generate lively and controversial discussion. She worked on the show for more than ten years and became closely identified with it.<br>
<br>While she never attained star status, Houston's talents are evident even in small and unrewarding roles. In <span class="italic">Carry on at your Convenience</span>, for example, she plays a strike-breaking mother who spanks her shop steward son. The role is often awkwardly written but she gives it a consistency largely absent from the script, making effortless transitions between screaming abuse and vamping her lodger with curdled charm. Her Scottish timbre freed her from the cut-glass diction that enfeebled many of her generation&#151;she was never typecast. Her looks were distinctive and her face mobile, seeming to become raddled or seductive within moments.<br>
<br>It was not surprising that Houston continued working until her death from pneumonia at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, on 9 February 1980. One of her proudest boasts was that she had been &#145;christened&#146; as a clown by the great Coco, one of the few women thus honoured. She published her autobiography, <span class="italic">Don't Fence me in</span>, in 1974. It pays extensive tribute to Donald Stewart and to her sister Billie.<br>
