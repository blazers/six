<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cochrane,  Thomas</span>, tenth earl of Dundonald  (1775&#150;1860), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born at Annesfield, Hamilton, Scotland, on 14 December 1775, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5750/', "Archibald Cochrane, ninth earl of Dundonald (1748&#150;1831)")</script>, and his first wife, Anne Gilchrist (1755&#150;1784), second daughter of Captain <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10715/', "James Gilchrist")</script> RN. Destined for the army, his father obtained a commission in the 104th regiment for him, while he was still a child, through his uncle, Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone. However from 1790 another uncle, Captain Alexander Inglis Cochrane (1758&#150;1832), placed his name on the books of the warships under his command, possibly securing him a small advantage in meeting the regulation requiring young officers to serve six years at sea before they could be commissioned. Despite six months at Chauvet's military academy in London in 1788 Cochrane expressed a strong desire to enter the navy. His father, after initial resistance, gave way. This decision may well have been hastened by his realization that, with his finances in ruins from attempts to develop a new chemical industry on the results of his scientific experiments, he could not afford to purchase military careers for all his sons. Having defied stern parental authority, Cochrane's confidence in his own judgement and lack of respect for mere authority were established. His father's financial ruin, leading to the sale of the family home, was an equally powerful stimulus. To the end of his life Cochrane was obsessed with money; it would be at the root of nearly all his problems.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandwarservice17931812"></a>Early career and war service, 1793&#150;1812</h2>Cochrane finally joined the Royal Navy, aged seventeen, on 27 June 1793, aboard HMS <i>Hind</i>, then commanded by his uncle. He was fortunate to receive his initial training in seamanship from the first lieutenant of the <i>Hind</i>, &#145;Jack&#146; Larmour, a first-class seaman who had risen from the ranks. Cochrane, an able and enthusiastic pupil, quickly assimilated Larmour's teaching, and throughout his career he excelled in practical seamanship. The two men moved, with Captain Cochrane, into the <i>Thetis</i> destined for the North American station. Cochrane was appointed acting lieutenant in January 1795, a rank in which he was confirmed on 24 May 1796, by which time he had acquired the necessary six years of sea-time. After service in the station flagship <i>Resolution</i> he returned to England. He was appointed to the <i>Foudroyant</i> and then the <i>Barfleur</i>, successive flagships of Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone (Lord Keith), a fellow Scot. Having already given marked evidence of his ability and independence of thought he found the atmosphere on the flagship stifling; this led to a quarrel with the first lieutenant, Philip Beaver, which resulted in a court martial for &#145;disrespect&#146;. It was an early indication of the pattern of his entire career. Anxious to get to sea, Keith acquitted Cochrane but admonished him to &#145;avoid flippancy&#146;. Cochrane remained with Keith during the blockade of Cadiz and his cruise into the Mediterranean, following him into the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>.<br>
<br>When the French battleship <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> was captured on 18 February 1800 Cochrane was appointed prize-master, taking the badly damaged and scratch-manned ship to Port Mahon in the Balearics, despite a gale that threatened to dismast the ship. Once given independent command his personal courage, seamanship, and leadership qualities were amply demonstrated. While on this service he missed the destruction of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> by fire off Leghorn on 17 March. Evidently Keith recognized his weaknesses and his qualities, for he reported to the Admiralty that he was &#145;wrong-headed, violent and proud&#146;  (Thomas, 84); but on 28 March he appointed him commander and sent him to the brig <i>Speedy</i>, a 158 ton vessel with fourteen 4-pounder guns, a crew of ninety officers and men, and orders to cruise off the Spanish coast. Cochrane's success led the Spanish authorities to send a frigate out to capture the <i>Speedy</i>, but Cochrane had disguised her as a Danish merchant ship. When finally intercepted, on 21 December, he flew a plague flag to keep the frigate's boat from boarding. Putting into Malta on 1 February 1801, he caused a brawl at a fancy-dress party and fought a duel before returning to sea the following day.<br>
<br>Cochrane's operations on the Spanish coast continued to be successful and were crowned with an astonishing feat of arms. On 6 May he encountered the small Spanish frigate <i>Gamo</i>, a 600 ton ship of 32 guns and 319 men. Although he had only fifty-four men on the <i>Speedy</i>, Cochrane, aware that his earlier subterfuge had been criticized, decided to engage. He ran the brig alongside the larger ship, fired in several accurate broadsides from his pathetic little guns while the Spanish shot flew over his small ships, and then carried the Spaniard by boarding. The <i>Speedy</i> lost four killed and seventeen wounded, the Spaniards fourteen and forty-one respectively. To carry his prize to Port Mahon, Cochrane confined the Spanish crew to the hold, training cannon on them. The astonishing quality of the victory led many to consider it the result of a trick, and the rewards given were both tardy and inadequate.<br>
<br>In the interval Cochrane had been ordered to convoy a packet from Mahon to Gibraltar, and on 3 July fell in with a French squadron of three battleships. After a skilful defence he surrendered to overwhelming force. The French captain was so impressed that he insisted that Cochrane continue to wear his sword. The French squadron then anchored off Algeciras, where they were attacked by a squadron under Admiral Sir James Saumarez on 6 July. Cochrane witnessed the battle from the French battleship <i>Desaix</i>. The following day he was released on parole to Gibraltar, and exchanged after Saumarez's victory in the Strait of Gibraltar on the 12th. Cochrane was court-martialled for the loss of the <i>Speedy</i>, but honourably acquitted. Over the thirteen months under his command he claimed to have taken 50 vessels, 122 guns, and 534 prisoners. After his acquittal he was promoted captain, on 8 August 1801. His request for the promotion of his lieutenant was turned down by the first lord of the Admiralty, the earl of St Vincent, on the grounds that the casualties of the <i>Speedy</i> were too slight to warrant it. Typically Cochrane replied, and his reply was neither deferential nor polite. He observed that there were more casualties on the <i>Speedy</i> than there had been on the earl's flagship, the <i>Victory</i>, at the battle of Cape St Vincent, for which much greater rewards had been given.<br>
<br>With the peace he was not given another ship and in late 1802 became a student at the University of Edinburgh, where he attended lectures by Dugald Stewart on political economy and worked diligently at his studies. When war broke out again in 1803 he pestered St Vincent for a ship, but the earl, who had little time for any &#145;Scotchmen&#146; and even less for those lacking a proper measure of respect for authority, gave him the <i>Arab</i>, a sixth-rate 20 gun French prize. The ship was in poor shape and was a poor performer at sea. Sent to join the command of Lord Keith, who was then blockading the French invasion shipping at Boulogne, Cochrane continued to complain about his ship and was &#145;rewarded&#146; by being detached to cruise to the north-east of the Orkney Islands to protect the fisheries. He remained here for fifteen months, no doubt as a mark of official displeasure at his insolent and hectoring correspondence. In 1804 the tory ministry returned. Lord Melville, the political manager of Scotland and a distant relative of Cochrane, became first lord and appointed Cochrane to the new 32 gun frigate <i>Pallas</i>. He had orders to cruise for a month off the Azores&#151;a very rich station, as war had just broken out with Spain. This cruise, between February and April 1805, proved to be particularly fortunate, resulting in several rich Spanish prizes as well as another of Cochrane's brilliant ruses to escape a French squadron. He brought back the <i>Pallas</i> into Plymouth Sound, the frigate having gold candlesticks 5 feet high tied to each mast-head.<br>
<br>In May the <i>Pallas</i> escorted a convoy to the St Lawrence River in Canada, and on her return, in December, joined the squadron of Vice-Admiral Thornborough for operations in the Bay of Biscay. Between February and the end of May 1806 the <i>Pallas</i>, while generally on detached service, captured, drove ashore, and burnt a large number of merchant vessels. On 6 April her boats cut out a French sloop of war from the River Garonne, leaving the ship with only forty men on board; yet the <i>Pallas</i> pursued, drove ashore, and burnt three French corvettes, each of which was more heavily manned. This action was reported by Thornborough, but the new ministry of the talents, which relied on St Vincent for naval advice, took no notice of it, did not purchase the sloop, and did not pay any prize or head money for the ships destroyed. On 14 May, while reconnoitring the French fleet in the Aix Roads, she was engaged by the 40 gun frigate <i>Minerve</i>, which was accompanied by three brigs. Having effectively beaten the <i>Minerve</i> Cochrane was denied his prize by two other French frigates weighing anchor to support her, and having lost her fore-topmast and maintopsail yard the <i>Pallas</i> had to be towed out by the sloop <i>Kingfisher</i>. Four days later he was ordered back to Plymouth with a convoy, and he arrived home on 27 June.<br>
<br>In July 1806 Cochrane stood for election at the notoriously corrupt borough of Honiton in Devon, and he refused to pay the usual bribe. After his defeat he paid 10 guineas to all those who voted for him; as a result he was elected unopposed at the general election in October but refused to pay the 10 guineas a vote his previous conduct had led his supporters to expect. He also defaulted on bills for &pound;1200 for the customary &#145;treats&#146; to the electors. He was already imbued with a deep suspicion of corruption in government, particularly at the Admiralty, and he had formed a close connection with the radical journalist William Cobbett.<br>
<br>On 2 September the crew of the <i>Pallas</i> was turned over into the frigate <i>Imperieuse</i>, which put to sea on 17 November and joined the blockading squadron in the Basque Roads twelve days later. She returned to Plymouth in February 1807, and Cochrane took a month's sick-leave in April in order to stand for the large, popular constituency of Westminster in the general election of May 1807. With the support of Cobbett he was returned alongside Sir Francis Burdett. In his election campaign he accused St Vincent of bartering naval commissions for borough influence, attacked abuses in naval administration, and called for the exclusion of government pensioners and placemen from the house. Ostentatiously refusing to adhere to any party, he launched an attack on a variety of abuses. On 7 July he called for an inquiry into places, pensions, and sinecures held by, or for, members, but it was defeated by the government. His call on the 10th for papers that would expose naval abuses did not even secure a division. It was thus hardly surprising that he was sent back to sea, on the Mediterranean station, shortly afterwards; he left Portsmouth on 12 September 1807. His constituents were so taken with his open and direct conduct that at a mass rally they gave him unlimited leave of absence.<br>
<br>Cochrane captured a Maltese pirate on 14 November and finally met up with the fleet of Admiral Lord Collingwood off Toulon on the 19th. Sent to act as senior officer at Corfu, he was soon recalled when his uncompromising attitude to trading with the enemy caused more problems than it solved. He rejoined the fleet on 2 January 1808 and at the end of the month was sent on a roving commission with instructions &#145;to harass the Spanish and French coast as opportunity served&#146;. Collingwood had the good sense to know how to use the talents of this argumentative and opinionated officer to best advantage, and he sent him on detached service. On this cruise Cochrane brought the art of littoral warfare to a new level of intensity. In the absence of a serious naval challenge the Royal Navy was reconfiguring itself to exploit the command of the sea. The new targets were small coasting-vessels, isolated harbours, signal stations, batteries, and lighthouses. The intention was to cripple the enemy's power of movement, destroying the logistics that underpinned operations on land. It was a form of warfare for which Cochrane was almost uniquely gifted, and of which he remained for many years the exemplar. In June the Spanish rising changed the nature of his war, and he was now instructed to &#145;render every possible assistance to the Spaniards against the French&#146;. The new circumstances redoubled the effectiveness of his campaign, providing local support, positions to hold, and intelligence. He ranged along the coasts of Catalonia and France, attacking roads, bridges, and stores. The object was to hamper the movement and operations of French armies, and this included the destruction of the semaphore system that was used to control the movement of coastal shipping. The manpower of a frigate, when deployed swiftly and skilfully, was invariably adequate to overwhelm the local defences of isolated posts and stations. In October Collingwood commented that:<blockquote>Nothing can exceed the zeal and activity with which his lordship pursues the enemy. The success which attends his enterprises clearly indicates with what skill and ability they are conducted, besides keeping the coast in constant alarm, causing a general suspension of the trade and harassing a body of troops employed in opposing him. (Lloyd, <span class="italic">Lord Cochrane</span>, 50)</blockquote>In late November Cochrane, for a fortnight and against overwhelming odds, defended the castle of Trinidad, outside the besieged town of Rosas; he finally evacuated the garrison and destroyed the fort when the French secured the town.<br>
<br>Early in 1809 Cochrane received permission to return home. His health was suffering from the arduous service, he wished to attack the corruption of the prize court at Malta, and he wanted to command a small squadron on the west coast of France for a more extensive littoral warfare campaign aimed at denying the French the ability to keep their troops in Spain supplied. When the <i>Imperieuse</i> arrived at Plymouth in late March, he was immediately summoned to the Admiralty. A powerful French squadron had been assembled in the Aix Roads, and the Admiralty wanted to attack it there. As the leading practitioner of littoral warfare, and with considerable experience of the Aix Roads, Cochrane was an obvious adviser, and when Lord Mulgrave, the first lord, pressed for his opinion, he produced a plan of attack using explosion-vessels and fireships, supported by the fleet. Admiral Lord Gambier, who commanded the Channel Fleet, was less certain. He recognized the utility of fireships but considered them a &#145;horrible mode of warfare&#146;  (Thomas, 148). When Mulgrave invited Cochrane to carry out his plan, Cochrane expressed concern that his appointment would create jealousy and resentment. Mulgrave promised to settle such difficulties but, characteristically, did nothing. Consequently, when Cochrane joined the fleet he found that Gambier was unenthusiastic, while Admiral Sir Eliab Harvey had already volunteered for the service, and considered, along with many others, that in sending Cochrane the board had insulted the Channel Fleet. However, Cochrane pressed on, persuading Gambier to prepare fireships and explosion-vessels, the latter being filled with 1500 lb of gunpowder, packed under heavy logs to direct the blast, and loaded with hundreds of shells and William Congreve's rockets. The explosion-vessels were intended, along with the fireships, to create chaos in the French squadron, leading them to put their ships ashore, where they could be easily destroyed.<br>
<br>On the night of 11 April Cochrane led the attack, destroying the French boom with the leading explosion-vessel. Despite the failure of the other explosion-vessels to reach their proper positions, the French ships cut their cables and drifted ashore. However, with few fireships left and the main fleet 14 miles off, Cochrane was unable to complete the process. At daybreak he began to signal for assistance, drawing Gambier's attention to the exposed condition of the French ships and the ease with which they might be destroyed; but the admiral studiously refused to act. He moved the fleet to within 3 miles, but then anchored. Desperate to continue his action, Cochrane allowed the <i>Imperieuse</i> to drift into the roadstead until she was able to engage some of the French ships. Only then did Gambier send in some support, which led to the destruction of four enemy ships. Gambier then recalled his ships, leaving the French to refloat most of their fleet and withdraw under the batteries. Having left Gambier in no doubt of his opinions, Cochrane was sent back to England with dispatches; he sailed on the morning of the 12th.<br>
<br>Although Cochrane was made a GCB in 1809&#151;only the second captain to be so rewarded, the first being his <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> St Vincent&#151;he was disgusted at the failure to exploit the success at the Aix Roads and to annihilate the enemy, as would have been expected of him by Horatio Nelson. He informed Mulgrave that if a vote of thanks was proposed for Gambier in the House of Commons he would oppose it, &#145;on the grounds that the commander in chief had not only done nothing to merit a vote of thanks, but had neglected to destroy the French fleet in Aix roads (the battle was known as Basque roads) when it was in his powers to do so&#146;. Gambier applied for a court martial. On 29 May Cochrane was ordered to prefer his charges, but he declined, arguing that the logbooks and signal-logs of the fleet contained all the information required. This was a major tactical error, and it denied him the standing from which to direct the case for the prosecution. In consequence Gambier, tried by a friendly court, was &#145;most honourably acquitted&#146; and then given the thanks of parliament for what was, under the most favourable interpretation, a gross error. The sentence of the court effectively convicted Cochrane of libelling a superior officer. Thus, his career in the Royal Navy could hardly survive. He submitted a plan to destroy the French ships and forts in the River Scheldt, but this was ignored. He was refused permission to rejoin his ship, then in the North Sea, but was ordered to do so a few months later when his speeches in parliament became embarrassing. Once again he was ordered to the Mediterranean, but he declined and went onto half pay, devoting his time to exposing abuses in the Admiralty. Although his efforts were ultimately successful, they did nothing to endear him to the government of the day, or to those officials who received all or part of their remuneration direct from those using their services rather than from the government. While this was normal practice in the eighteenth century, it had been swept away by the time Cochrane wrote his memoirs, helping to cement his &#145;liberal&#146; reputation with progressivist historians.<br>
<br>Cochrane's performances in parliament were rarely effective, being too violent, uncompromising, and acrimonious to gather the support his cause required. One of the best, on 11 May 1810, drew a striking comparison between the pensions awarded to wounded naval officers and seamen and the sinecures held by ministers. The following year, after a visit to Malta, he was able to publicize the corrupt practices in the Malta prize court. He also criticized the use of large armies to prop up despotic Sicilian and Portuguese regimes when a maritime strategy would be more effective and far cheaper.<br>
<br>Cochrane's inventive and scientific mind led him to develop a plan to destroy the French fleets, which had long been skulking in defended harbours, beyond the reach of conventional attack, with a combination of massive bombardment from extemporized mortars, and poison gas created by burning sulphur. His plans were submitted to the prince regent, and though a committee headed by the duke of York and including Lord Keith, Lord Exmouth, and Sir William Congreve had little doubt they would succeed, they considered them inhumane and feared they might rebound to the disadvantage of Britain. When the plans were rejected Cochrane promised the prince regent that he would never allow them to fall into the hands of a foreign government.<br>
<br>On 8 August 1812, at Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, Cochrane secretly married Katherine Corbett Barnes (1796&#150;1865), a sixteen-year-old orphan, daughter of Thomas Barnes of Romford, Essex, despite the efforts of his uncle Basil to marry him to a rich heiress. The marriage, though ultimately held to be legal, was subject to considerable doubt, and the couple were married twice more, in Anglican and Scottish ceremonies in June 1818 and in 1825. Although their relationship was by no means smooth, which was hardly surprising in the circumstances, Katherine accompanied her husband on his South American visit during his career. While Cochrane was in service in Greece she had an affair with Lord Auckland, who was acting as his trustee. Thereafter she spent much of her life abroad. The couple had four sons and one daughter; their third son, Arthur Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane (1824&#150;1905), had a successful naval career. Lady Dundonald died at Boulogne on 25 January 1865.<h2>
<a name="ScandalpoliticsandSouthAmerica18131825"></a>Scandal, politics, and South America, 1813&#150;1825</h2>In late 1813 Cochrane's naval uncle, now Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, was appointed to command the North American station, then at the heart of the Anglo-American War. He went out in a frigate, leaving his flagship the <i>Tonnant</i> to be fitted out by Cochrane, whom he had nominated as his flag captain. This was an ideal field for an expert in littoral warfare, the whole coastline of the United States lay open to sea-based attack, and Admiral Cochrane was only too anxious to carry the war to an American population he despised. However, fate once again intervened. Cochrane's uncle had agreed to take Captain De Berenger, a French exile officer, to instruct his marines in the use of rifles and explosives. However, De Berenger was also an undischarged bankrupt. On 20 February 1814, while at Dover, he sent word to the admiral at Deal that he was Lord Cathcart's aide-de-camp and was carrying news from France that Napoleon was dead and that the allied armies were advancing rapidly on Paris. This intelligence caused the value of government funds to rise rapidly, only to fall when the hoax was exposed. The opportunity was exploited by Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone, Cochrane's uncle, to net a large profit. De Berenger had posted up to London, taken a cab to Cochrane's home in Green Street after having changed out of the scarlet of a staff officer&#151;which he was not entitled to wear&#151;into his own green uniform, and persuaded Cochrane to lend him some plain clothes. He was traced to Cochrane's home, and when Cochrane learned of the swindle he informed the authorities. De Berenger, Cochrane-Johnstone, Cochrane, and others were arrested, tried before Lord Ellenborough, and found guilty. It appeared that Cochrane was ignorant of the whole affair, but the guilt of his uncle, his considerable stockholding, contact with De Berenger, and well-known interest in money, together with the evident bias of Ellenborough, were enough to convict him. He was condemned to pay a fine of &pound;1000, to stand for one hour in the pillory, and to be imprisoned in the king's bench for one year. The pillory was remitted, probably because the government feared a riot. These penalties were as nothing compared to the indignity that was heaped upon him; he was struck off the navy list on 25 June, expelled from the House of Commons on 5 July, and from the chapel of the knight of the Bath. Within days he was returned to the House of Commons by the electors of Westminster, they having declared at a mass meeting their entire confidence that the charges were unfounded. Cochrane was imprisoned, and after escaping and being recaptured his conditions were made particularly severe. Finally, on 20 June 1815, he was entitled to be released, and after reluctantly paying the fine on 3 July, in the interests of his health, he still protested his innocence. He always blamed John Wilson Croker, the secretary of the Admiralty, for his disgrace, though there was never any proof, beyond a well-known political and personal hatred. More than thirty years later Admiral Sir Thomas Byam-Martin recalled his hearing the prince regent express his determination that Cochrane be degraded.<br>
<br>Cochrane returned to the House of Commons to vote against the increased pension for the duke of Cumberland, and for two years he was an energetic promoter of reform, and a committed opponent of the government. His opposition, though based on principle and well intentioned, was coloured by personal bitterness. In August 1816 he was charged with escaping from the king's bench&#151;a charge which he believed was laid to punish him for his political opposition. Claiming that, as a member of parliament, his imprisonment had been illegal, he nevertheless admitted the charge and was found guilty. The sentence was deferred, but three months later, after he had spoken at another large public meeting, he was condemned to pay a fine of &pound;100. He refused to do this, but after sixteen days' imprisonment he was released when the money was paid by a penny subscription that covered his earlier fine of &pound;1000 and also much of his legal costs. Thereafter his radicalism shifted towards a liberal combination with the whigs.<br>
<br>After such evident signs of official hostility, which Cochrane believed included spies and well-founded fears that he was involved in a plot to liberate Napoleon from St Helena and take him to South America, it was scarcely surprising that he accepted the invitation of the Chilean government to organize and command their fleet in their war of liberation from Spain in May 1817. His political sympathies and financial ambitions intersected nicely in a well-paid mercenary role which also involved fighting for freedom. After the 1818 session of parliament, during which he organized the construction of the <i>Rising Star</i>, the first seagoing steam warship, he went to France in August and then sailed for Valpara&iacute;so on a merchant ship, arriving on 28 November to an enthusiastic welcome. His arrival was timely: a powerful Spanish squadron was preparing to attack Valpara&iacute;so, and the Chilean navy comprised only seven vessels, a captured Spanish 50 gun frigate renamed the <i>O'Higgins</i>, and a collection of old merchant ships and condemned vessels from the Royal Navy. Cochrane's real strength lay not in ships but in officers and men. His name ensured that he could recruit predominantly British and American crews for his flagship and could stiffen the resolve of his Chilean crews with these experienced men-of-wars-men. Against such an admiral as Cochrane, leading experienced crews, the inexperienced and ill-prepared Spaniards did not expect to win. They had recognized this even before he had left London, then trying to buy him into their own service. Putting to sea in the <i>O'Higgins</i> in January 1819, Cochrane blocked the Spaniards in the harbour and conducted a typical littoral campaign, scattering soldiers and capturing shipping and treasure to fund his activities. After an abortive attack on the Spaniards at Callao in Peru, he took his flagship to Valdivia; having reconnoitred the place and secured 250 soldiers from a nearby Chilean garrison, he landed and stormed the forts in his best style, which seemed impetuous but was in fact carefully planned. The garrison panicked and was driven out, leaving a hundred dead, while the Chileans lost no more than seven men. Cochrane then returned to Valpara&iacute;so and found his triumph ill-rewarded by jealous ministers. After tendering his resignation he was promised better treatment for himself and the seamen on which so much depended. The Valdivia prize money was never paid.<br>
<br>Having temporarily resolved his differences with the Chileans, Cochrane joined a large combined expedition to liberate Peru. General Jos&eacute; de San Mart&iacute;n embarked almost 4000 men aboard the fleet and sailed from Valpara&iacute;so in late August 1820. Twice the army landed at a distance from the centres of Spanish power, despite Cochrane's call for an immediate strike at Callao and Lima. He knew that the Spanish position, while outwardly formidable, was brittle and would collapse much as Valdivia had, if attacked quickly. San Mart&iacute;n, encouraged by his army, was convinced that Peru had to secure its own independence if the nation were to be properly established. Unable to influence these operations, Cochrane resolved, without reference to San Mart&iacute;n, to cut out the frigate <i>Esmerelda</i>, the last major Spanish warship in the south Pacific, from under the batteries at Callao. On the night of 5 November the boats of the fleet were able to get into the harbour and board the ship at several places before the alarm was raised. Unable to escape, the Spaniards fought furiously but were finally overpowered, though not before eleven of the &#145;Chilean&#146; force were killed and thirty wounded, including Cochrane, who sustained a severe injury. Once the fighting began the shore batteries fired on the ship without troubling to ascertain whether their own men were still aboard. Cochrane, having seen that the English and American warships in harbour were using a pattern of lights hoisted into the rigging, surmised that this had been pre-arranged with the shore batteries and therefore copied it, allowing the <i>Esmerelda</i> to escape relatively unharmed. His original intention, which was to capture or destroy the rest of the shipping in the harbour, was frustrated by his injury. This action reduced the Spanish to a hopeless position; unable to reinforce their navy on the station, and unable to operate on the coast, they could only wait to be overpowered by the forces of the new states. Cochrane, however, had other ideas. Once recovered, he persuaded San Mart&iacute;n to lend him 600 soldiers, with which he staged another littoral campaign of great audacity, virtually forcing the Spanish authorities at Lima to capitulate&#151;which they did on 6 July 1821. San Mart&iacute;n proclaimed himself protector of Peru and demanded that Cochrane and the fleet swear loyalty to the new republic in return for their wages and prize money. Cochrane refused and sailed off to seize San Mart&iacute;n's treasury, out of which he paid the men and refitted the squadron. He returned to Valpara&iacute;so in June 1822, after an absence of twenty months, to receive a popular welcome&#151;and the hostility of the ministers. When San Mart&iacute;n returned in October he was loaded with honours and rewards, despite Cochrane's denunciation of his treacherous conduct, while sums due to Cochrane and his men were unpaid. The Chilean republic was about to dissolve into anarchy, so Cochrane decided to leave rather than take sides; he took an extended leave of absence in November. He had done as much as any foreign national could.<br>
<br>Cochrane's services in Chile and Peru had increased the renown of his name, and other countries seeking independence desired to secure his services. Brazil, Mexico, and Greece were all anxious to hire him, but although Greece was his preference, he took service, temporarily, with the Brazilians when he reached Rio de Janeiro on 13 March 1823. He was appointed admiral by the new emperor, Pedro I, and spent eighteen months building up the Brazilian navy, securing British and American seamen, and defeating the attempts of Portugal to re-establish control. Once again his anxiety to secure the largest prize-fund, and his outspoken attacks on corruption, ensured that he had enemies in high places. He spent more time defending his position than he did serving the state. In early 1825, after Brazilian independence had been effectively secured, he took his flagship to sea and, finding her unequal to bad weather, ended up back in England at Spithead. When the Brazilian minister in London refused to fund a refit, Cochrane refused to take her to sea and remained ashore until the peace between Portugal and Brazil was settled, on 3 November, at which time he resigned the Brazilian admiralship.<h2>
<a name="Greekliberation18271828"></a>Greek liberation, 1827&#150;1828</h2>The members of the London Greek Committee, notably his fellow radicals Burdett, Hobhouse, Bowring, and Hume, were certain that Cochrane was the only person who could secure the independence of Greece from Turkish rule. However, Cochrane was only too well aware of the petty jealousies and irresolution that had attended him in South America to enter into the project lightly. Consequently his acceptance was conditional on prior payment for his services, plus a heavy expenditure on six British-built war steamers, and two large American-built frigates. All were to be manned by British or American seamen, and he was to have complete and uncontrolled command of the Greek fleet. This was agreed, but he spent the next eighteen months trying to advance the construction of the steamers, which he had long recognized as vital for littoral warfare, and which would be especially important in the Greek archipelago, giving him a priceless advantage over the larger Turkish fleet of sailing ships. In the event only two of the steamers actually reached Greece, and neither was particularly successful&#151;a result of design failings, poor construction, corruption, and the intervention of Egyptian agents. Even so, the <i>Karteria</i>, under Captain Frank Abney Hastings, proved Cochrane's vision and made a valuable contribution to the war of independence.<br>
<br>When Cochrane arrived in Greece on a yacht in March 1827, he found that none of the new ships was ready; only one frigate and two steamers would be completed in time to serve. He found the Greek sailors singularly lacking in patriotism and, unable to pay them, had to watch them take their craft off to conduct their own piratical campaign. Without the British and American sailors he had demanded his fireship attack on Alexandria failed, and there was little he could do before Sir Edward Codrington destroyed the Turco-Egyptian fleets at Navarino on 20 October 1827. This victory ensured Greek independence. Cochrane's contribution lay largely in the prestige of his name, which was still the terror of the oceans, and the degree of urgency his presence impressed on the European powers to secure a settlement. His rewards were negligible: much of his pay was withheld and the rest locked up in depreciating Greek stock. Even so, he was once again accused of fraud, being connected with the committee that managed to make &pound;200,000 disappear, without benefit for Greece. He returned to England to advance work on the steamships but in September 1828 went back to Greece, where he found that the imminence of peace made his presence most unwelcome. He left for the last time, on a Russian warship, in December. If the Greek war added nothing to his fame, it was only because there was precious little room for further lustre. He remained the greatest &#145;name&#146; afloat, and his efforts in South America remained the outstanding example of enlightened mercenary service, in which maritime power was used to secure the independence of three countries.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears18281860"></a>Last years, 1828&#150;1860</h2>Fortunately for Cochrane the end of his mercenary career coincided with a major change in British politics. The end of more than twenty years of tory rule, combined with the accession in 1830 of a naval monarch, William IV, enabled him to return to the Royal Navy. He had first approached William in 1828 when, as duke of Clarence, he held the post of lord high admiral, but the tory cabinet had demurred. Finally, on 2 May 1832, he was given a &#145;free pardon&#146; rather than the annulment of his conviction for fraud which he had sought. He was restored to his proper rank in the navy, now that of a rear-admiral, and was received at court. But he was not given back his GCB, and his banner was not replaced in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. His position remained anomalous: in effect he had been excused for something he had not done, in order that his name and reputation could be wielded by the British state as a deterrent. The first occasion on which this &#145;Cochrane rattling&#146; occurred was the Russian scare of that year. For the next twenty years successive first lords of the Admiralty recognized that he would be given high command in war, even if they were generally reluctant to employ him in peace. In the interval he had succeeded his father, as tenth earl of Dundonald, on 1 July 1831. The popular naval fiction of his one-time midshipman Frederick Marryat helped pave the way for his return to favour, as Marryat publicized his remarkable exploits aboard the <i>Imperieuse</i>, giving them a strong liberal twist. If it was Marryat who created the genre of naval fiction, then it was Cochrane who inspired it. His career remains at the heart of the genre, notably in the work of Patrick O'Brien.<br>
<br>Once re-established in London, Cochrane turned his attention to the scientific and technical interests inherited from his father and reinforced by his experience of war at sea. The development of steam propulsion was his major interest, and he pursued several key technologies, often years in advance of the necessary metallurgical and engineering progress needed to make them practical. His work culminated in the steam warship HMS <i>Janus</i> of 1848, which combined his hull form, rotary engines, and boilers in a promising, if unsuccessful, package. Clearly he was indulged by the Admiralty, which was only too happy to see him occupied with engines rather than returning to his old line of attacks on naval administration.<br>
<br>After Cochrane had recovered his GCB from the new liberal ministry in 1847, his old friend Lord Auckland, the first lord of the Admiralty, re-examined his poison gas plans, for use against Cherbourg, and employed him afloat in 1848 as commander-in-chief in the West Indies. Auckland had long recognized Cochrane's value and considered it unwise to deny him the experience of command, if he was to be used in war. The three-year commission was interesting but uneventful. Cochrane sent in valuable reports on the colonies and their resources, and he brought back to England asphalt from Trinidad with which to pave the streets of Westminster&#151;a premature stroke of genius that proved incompatible with horses. On 21 March 1851 he became a full admiral, and by the early 1850s he had become a national treasure, a reminder of past greatness to replace the recently deceased duke of Wellington. He was nominated rear-admiral of the United Kingdom on 23 October 1854 and was also elected an elder brother of Trinity House. He had no further sea service, though during the Crimean War of 1854&#150;6 he offered to deploy a version of his poison gas plan of 1812 against Kronstadt and Sevastopol. This was initially rejected in 1854 by a committee of naval officers advised by Michael Faraday&#151;largely, it would appear, because the plan gave a subordinate role to the battle fleet. It was taken up again in 1855, by a despairing Lord Palmerston, on the grounds that any failure would be attributed to Cochrane's age and eccentricity rather than to the government. However, Sevastopol fell before it could be put into effect.<br>
<br>During his last years Cochrane wrote several volumes of memoirs. These colourful, if imperfect, accounts helped to cement his place in the national pantheon. They were intended to support his financial claims against various governments, beginning with <span class="italic">Narrative of services in the liberation of Chili, Peru, and Brazil, from Spanish and Portuguese domination</span> (1859), followed by <span class="italic">Autobiography of a Seaman</span> (1860&#150;61). The series was brought to an abrupt end by his sudden death at 12 Queen's Gate, Kensington, London, on 31 October 1860. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 14 November.<br>
<br>After Cochrane's death the process of restoring his honours continued. A parliamentary committee of 1878 paid his son &pound;5000 for his &#145;distinguished services&#146;; in truth, this was the half pay he was owed for the period when he was struck off the navy list. The process went so far that Lord Ellenborough became the villain of the piece, and his side of the case had to be defended in print by the end of the century. The navies of Chile, Peru, and Brazil continued to celebrate his contribution for many years, and Chile named a succession of capital ships for him.<br>
<br>Cochrane was the most brilliant naval officer of the period that followed the death of Nelson in 1805, and he was the only one who achieved a world reputation. However, his true greatness has been much misunderstood. He never commanded a ship, let alone a squadron, against first-class opposition in good fighting order. (After 1805 such opportunities were rare.) His peculiar talents were honed in littoral warfare off the coasts of Spain and France, culminating in the assault on the Aix Roads, which, like much else that he did, relied on the enemy being already half beaten. In South America he deployed this system of warfare to the greatest effect, relying on his name, battle-hardened British and American sailors, and demoralized opponents to secure rapid and decisive results from apparently unpromising situations. To the end of his life his thoughts centred on the projection of maritime power ashore, not fleet-to-fleet encounters. As a result he was among the first to see the potential of steamships, at a time when they remained short-ranged, unreliable, and weakly armed. By contrast his political career lacked the tactical skill, insight, and cunning that made him so successful at sea; in this field his popularity was based on a straightforward, direct naval approach that was diametrically opposed to the usual conduct of business at Westminster. He made many enemies by incautious words, giving offence when he would have been better advised to be tactful; and by alienating St Vincent he missed the chance to co-operate with the other great naval reformer of the age. His disgrace in 1814 arose from a trusting nature and the obvious delight of those whom he had pilloried for so long to get their own back. That it kept him out of his uncle's major littoral warfare campaigns against the Americans helped his posthumous reputation more than it hindered the British war effort at the time. As a scientist and engineer he shared many of his father's eccentricities, but withal had a clear purpose and came close to success.<br>
<br>The key to Cochrane's complex character&#151;the combination of ambition, genius, daring, and resource that made him great, the direct manner and rejection of authority where it did not meet his own high standards that set him apart, and the greed, pride, and vindictiveness that held him back&#151;can be traced to his relationship with his father and, in all probability, a sense of rejection following the death of his mother and his removal to military academy on his father's second marriage. In private he was charming and had an honest and open character; his violent politics reflected an obsessive hatred of corruption and an inability to suffer slights. His qualities of leadership were beyond compare, securing the undying love of junior officers, seamen, and the unruly constituents of Westminster. In old age he tended to dwell on the political and financial wrongs of his career, pursuing the various governments he had served for moneys left unpaid, and passing on his claims to his son. Yet, like Nelson, his greatness rose above petty human failings. With his long life, full range of adventures, and variety of careers Cochrane remains one of the great, if unfulfilled, biographical subjects. He was, and remains, the romantic naval hero.<br>
