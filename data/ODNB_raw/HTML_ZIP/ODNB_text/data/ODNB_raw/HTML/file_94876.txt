<span class="headword">Hardee,  Malcolm Gerrard</span>  (1950&#150;2005), <span class="occ">comedian and comedy promoter</span>, was born on 5 January 1950 in Lewisham Hospital, London, the eldest child of (Harry) Frank George Hardee, Thames lighterman, and his wife, Joan Annie Alicia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurley. He attended St Stephen's Church of England primary school, Colfe's Grammar School, Lewisham, and Sedgehill comprehensive school, Catford, and was expelled from all three. After stealing a bicycle at the age of eleven he fell into a life of petty crime, which encompassed car theft, burglary, and cheque fraud. &#145;Later, when it suited me, I would claim I'd fallen in with a bad lot, but the truth was that <i>I</i> was the bad lot&#146;  (Hardee, 18&#150;19). As a result he spent much of his youth and early adulthood in borstals and in Wandsworth, Exeter, and Grendon Underwood prisons. By the late 1970s he had got bored with crime and incarceration, and he later reflected that &#145;Prison is like mime or juggling: a tragic waste of time&#146;  (ibid., 49).<br>
<br>In 1978 Hardee joined Martin Soan and others in The Greatest Show on Legs, which performed an adult Punch and Judy show and various comedy sketches in pubs and at hippy festivals in Devon and East Anglia. The group was introduced to the emerging alternative cabaret scene by Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson, and started appearing at the Comedy Store in London. In 1981 they developed the infamous balloon dance, which involved the three members of the group appearing naked and precariously covering their genitals with balloons. Performing it on the late-night television show <span class="italic">OTT</span> brought them national fame and cult status in Sweden.<br>
<br>By the time The Greatest Show on Legs split up in 1983 Hardee had already started to establish himself as a solo stand-up (with the catchphrase &#145;Oy Oy!&#146;). He was described by John Connor as &#145;not exactly the world's greatest comic [but] probably the world's best con-man of comedy&#146;  (Connor, 27); Hardee's material was unremarkable, often consisting of old gags introduced with a bark of &#145;Joke number one&#146;, &#145;Joke number two&#146;, etc. What brought him notoriety on the comedy circuit was his tendency towards nakedness and urination. One routine involved him doing an impression of General de Gaulle with his penis, and he was once sacked for urinating on stage while comp&egrave;ring at the Albany Empire.<br>
<br>Hardee was probably more significant on the alternative comedy circuit as a promoter than as a performer, running venues and managing other acts. He set up the Tunnel Club in a pub called The Mitre in Greenwich in January 1984, and it became legendary for the boisterousness of its audience, which many comedians found terrifying. Indeed, in a notable incident that Hardee saw as the beginning of the end for the venue Babs Sutton of the double act Clarence and Joy Pickles was hit in the face by a glass which had been hurled at the stage. After the Tunnel closed, Hardee set up another Greenwich venue, Up the Creek, with a slightly less fearsome reputation. He also managed various comedians, including Jerry Sadowitz, and was credited with helping the careers of Harry Enfield, Vic Reeves, and Jo Brand (with whom he had an affair).<br>
<br>Perhaps Hardee's greatest attribute, though, was his genius for publicity stunts. In the 1983 Edinburgh festival fringe he disrupted the show of the American performance artist Eric Bogosian by driving a sit-down lawnmower through the tent in which he was performing. In 1986 he stole an enormous birthday cake that had been baked for Freddie Mercury's fortieth birthday party, the incident providing the title for Hardee's autobiography. He ran for parliament in Greenwich in 1987, winning 174 votes for the Rainbow Alliance Beer, Fags and Skittles Party, and again in 1991, this time as a way of exploiting the free mail shot to get leaflets promoting Off the Kerb to 10,000 constituents. This was not the only example of publicity stunts being used to promote his comedy ventures. In 1989 he got his friend and fellow comedian Arthur Smith to review his Edinburgh show and submit it to <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> under the name of the noted comedy critic William Cook, only revealing the scam after it had been published.<br>
<br>From the late 1970s until 1990 Hardee's partner was Philippa (Pip) Hazelton, with whom he had two children, Frank (<i>b</i>. 1985) and Poppy (<i>b</i>. 1988). Fittingly, he married Jane Kintrea Matthews (a 35-year-old publicity officer, and daughter of Robert Ian Matthews, farmer) on April fool's day 1993. They split up in 2000, causing him to abandon his final Edinburgh show (his first was in 1982) after only two nights. About 31 January 2005 he drowned in Greenland Dock, Bermondsey, when he fell out of the dinghy that was carrying him from the boat-based pub he ran, the Wibbley Wobbley, to his houseboat; his body was found on 2 February. His funeral, at St Alfege's Church in Greenwich on 17 February, included contributions from a number of comedians, and his coffin bore a floral tribute that spelt out the words &#145;Knob Out&#146;. He was survived by his two children.<br>
