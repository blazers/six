<span class="headword">Marshall,  William Calder</span>  (1813&#150;1894), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 18 March 1813 in Gilmour Place, Edinburgh, the eldest son of William Marshall, a goldsmith, and his wife, Annie Calder. He was educated at the high school, Edinburgh, and at Edinburgh University, and attended the Trustees' Academy from 1830. In 1834 he went to London, where he worked in the studios of Francis Chantrey and Edward Hodges Baily; on 21 April 1834, on the recommendation of Chantrey, he entered the Royal Academy Schools, and the following year he gained the academy's silver medal. Like most sculptors of his generation, he was intent on completing his education in Rome, and he went there in 1836, via Paris. He befriended the British sculptors John Gibson and Lawrence Macdonald and designed several &#145;ideal&#146; works based on his studies of the antique.<br>
<br>Marshall received few commissions while in Rome, and had to rely on his family for financial support; on his return to Britain in 1838 he worked for a short time in Edinburgh, and in 1839 settled permanently in London. He married twice: first to Marianne Lawrie in 1842 (she died in the same year) and second in 1845 to Margaret Calder; he and Margaret had four sons and two daughters. Following the exhibition held in Westminster Hall in 1844, Marshall was selected to execute statues of lords Clarendon (1852) and Somers (1855) for the new houses of parliament. He gained many commissions for public statues in the following years, including those for the poet Thomas Campbell (1848) for Westminster Abbey and the inventor Samuel Crompton (1862) for Bolton, Lancashire. His greatest success in public competition was in 1857, when his model for the proposed monument to the duke of Wellington in St Paul's Cathedral was awarded first prize out of eighty-three entrants. However, the commission, amid much controversy, went to Alfred Stevens, whose design was considered more suitable for the intended setting. Marshall subsequently made three biblical reliefs (1863) for the cathedral.<br>
<br>Marshall did not restrict his production to commemorative monuments; he also designed schemes of architectural sculpture (for example, the pediment figures for Bolton town hall, <i>c</i>.1870) and several church monuments. His group symbolizing <span class="roman">Agriculture</span> (1864) is included on the Albert memorial in Kensington Gardens, London. He also showed some 120 &#145;ideal&#146; and narrative works at the Royal Academy between 1836 and 1891, probably the largest contribution of any Victorian sculptor. These encompassed the broad range of themes popular with artists of the period, including classical, biblical, and literary subjects, as well as some quite novel areas&#151;mirroring those of contemporary painting&#151;such as ancient history and Pompeian genre. Despite its variety, his work seldom showed any great originality of conception and usually adhered to conventional classicizing types. He adopted a businesslike approach to his art, which brought him considerable wealth: at his death his estate was valued at &pound;48,709.<br>
<br>Marshall was described by the painter George Dunlop Leslie as &#145;rather quiet, and very Scottish and shrewd&#146;  (Leslie, 171); a portrait of the sculptor by Patrick Allan-Fraser is at Hospitalfield House, Arbroath, Forfarshire, and a plaster self-portrait bust showing him as a young man is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. He was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1840 but resigned in 1844 and was made an honorary member in 1861; he became an ARA in 1844 and RA in 1852, and was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1878. Marshall died at his home, 115 Ebury Street, Chester Square, London, on 16 June 1894, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
