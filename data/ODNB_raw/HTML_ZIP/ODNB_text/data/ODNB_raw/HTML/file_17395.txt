<span class="headword">McCombie,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1805, <em>d.</em> 1880), <span class="occ">cattle breeder</span>, was born at Home Farm, Tillyfour, Aberdeenshire, and baptized on 3 August 1805, the younger son of Charles McCombie, a farmer and cattle dealer, who was descended from an old highland family, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Black. He was educated at the parish school and Marischal College, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>McCombie worked with his father until he leased the Tillyfour farm from him in 1829, and in 1832 he founded a polled Angus herd. Realizing that there was no future in driving lean cattle from the north of Scotland to be fattened in the south, he turned to the breeding of black polled cattle, carrying on the work of Hugh Watson of Keiller (1789&#150;1865), the first to improve Aberdeen Angus cattle. McCombie became famous as an exhibitor of prize stock, and was the first Scottish exhibitor of fat cattle at Birmingham. He won more than five hundred prizes, including Prince Albert's cup for the best animal in the French or foreign classes at Poissy in 1862, and a similar prize at the Paris Exhibition in 1878. After his champion ox, Black Prince, won the blue riband at Smithfield in 1866, Queen Victoria asked him to bring it to Windsor, and following this the queen visited Tillyfour in 1867 to inspect McCombie's herd. McCombie also wrote <span class="italic">Cattle and Cattle Breeders</span> (1867), which ran to four editions. He was one of the largest farmers in Aberdeenshire, with 1200 acres of arable land, and he was one of the earliest presidents of the Scottish chamber of agriculture.<br>
<br>From 1868 until 1876 McCombie was MP for West Aberdeenshire, the first tenant farmer to be an MP in Scotland. He resigned in 1876 because of failing health. The McCombie prize for black polled cattle, an annual prize, was set up in Aberdeen in his honour. McCombie spent the rest of his life at Tillyfour, which he had bought in 1875, on the death of his eldest brother. He died unmarried at Home Farm on 1 February 1880.<br>
