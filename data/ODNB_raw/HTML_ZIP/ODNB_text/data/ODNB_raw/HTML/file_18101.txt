<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marsden,  Samuel</span>  (1765&#150;1838), <span class="occ">missionary and farmer</span>, was born on 25 June 1765 at Bagley, near Farsley, Yorkshire, the eldest of the five surviving children of Thomas Marsden, butcher, and his wife, Bathsheba Brown. He went to school at Farsley, and subsequently worked for his uncle John Marsden, a blacksmith at Horsforth. His reputation as a lay preacher drew the attention of the evangelical Elland Society, which sought to train poor men for the ministry of the Church of England. Under the society's sponsorship he attended Hull grammar school, where he was taught by Joseph Milner and came into contact with William Wilberforce. In 1790 the society sent him to Magdalene College, Cambridge, but he cut short his university studies to respond to the call of the evangelical leader Charles Simeon for service in overseas missions. On 1 January 1793 he accepted the appointment of assistant to Richard Johnson, chaplain of New South Wales. On 14 March he wrote to Elizabeth (1772&#150;1835), daughter of Thomas Fristan of Hull, inviting her to &#145;take up your Cross&#146;  (Mitchell Library, A1677, vol. 3, fols. 1&#150;4) and share in his missionary labours. They married at Holy Trinity Church, Hull, on 21 April; a month later, on 26 May, Samuel was ordained at Exeter. In July they sailed for Australia.<br>
<br>The Marsdens arrived to find Johnson, the senior chaplain, deep in conflict with the acting lieutenant-governor of New South Wales, Major Francis Grose, over the priorities urged by the secular and the religious authorities. The secular authorities were predominantly concerned with the maintenance of discipline among the convicts and were heavily influenced by the opportunities for material advancement available in the colony; these imperatives sat uneasily with the chaplains' religious mission to the convicts and settlers. Marsden was soon drawn into the materialism of the colony, making his home at Parramatta, some 14 miles west of Sydney, and acquiring a farm of considerable proportions: he sent the first commercial cargo of wool to England in 1811, and made important contributions in sheep-breeding and the marketing of wool. More importantly, in 1795 Governor Hunter, who had replaced Grose, made the chaplains magistrates. They saw their civil power as a means of &#145;bringing the inhabitants &hellip; under some proper government and subordination&#146;  (Yarwood, 50&#150;51), but in the convict colony their moral and spiritual influence was undermined by their identification with the establishment of judges, gaolers, and floggers. Johnson left for England in 1800, worn out in mind and body, while Marsden acquired a reputation for severity as a magistrate, which he deserved in the light of his frequent recourse to flogging. He had come to doubt the possibility of reclaiming the souls of convicts, and believed that rigorous discipline was the only way to maintain morality in the penal colony.<br>
<br>Marsden's evangelistic instincts were thus frustrated among the convicts and met with no greater success among the Australian Aborigines, and so he turned his energies to the Pacific islanders, and particularly the Maori of New Zealand, through the London Missionary Society (LMS) and the Church Missionary Society (CMS). In 1804 he became the agent for LMS operations in the Pacific. A prolonged visit to England in 1807&#150;9 laid the foundations for a mission to the Maori, while also drawing attention to the state of the church in New South Wales and recruiting additional chaplains. He was encouraged by the CMS to establish a mission at the Bay of Islands in northern New Zealand, and he drew together a group of settlers to prepare the ground for the missionaries. The setting up of the mission was delayed by administrative and financial differences and government prohibition until 1814, when Marsden bought his own ship, the <i>Active</i>; in December of that year he made the first of his seven voyages to New Zealand, and he preached his first sermon at Rangihoua on Christmas day 1814. He negotiated secure conditions for the missionaries, and made the first purchase of land for the mission. On subsequent trips he continued to preach, to explore, and to encourage the settlement and economic development of the islands. He also fostered missionary work among the South Sea islanders. On his last visit to New Zealand in 1837 he was greeted with veneration by both Maori and settlers.<br>
<br>In Australia itself Marsden's reputation was less gilded. His material success cast doubt on the sincerity of his missionary ventures; the rift between him and Lachlan Macquarie, governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821, over everything from the evangelization of the Aborigines to convict and emancipation policy placed Marsden in the position of a <i>de facto</i> leader of the illiberal opposition. Censured by the colonial secretary for his conviction of Ann Rumsby in the face of the evidence, suspended from the bench for refusing to sit with Henry Douglass, a political opponent, and passed over for the position of archdeacon in 1824, Marsden remained unpopular with Macquarie's successor, Brisbane, although under Darling he received some official appointments and encouragement in his missionary work.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Marsden died in 1835, after twenty years of poor health and bearing ten children (the first on board the ship which brought them to Australia in 1794). Marsden's own health broke down in 1837, and he died on 12 May 1838 at St Matthew's parsonage, Windsor, New South Wales, where he had gone for a rest. He was buried in the churchyard of St John's, Parramatta.<br>
