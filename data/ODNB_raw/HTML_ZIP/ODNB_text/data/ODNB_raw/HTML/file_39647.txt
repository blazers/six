<span class="headword">Westmacott,  Charles Molloy</span>  (1787/8&#150;1868), <span class="occ">journalist and blackmailer</span>, was apparently the illegitimate second son of Richard (Dick) Westmacott (<i>bap</i>. 1746, <i>d</i>. 1808), sculptor, whose name he took, and of Susannah Molloy, a &#145;pretty widow&#146; and innkeeper, though his enemies alleged he was the son of Charles Molloy, a master chimney sweep of Covent Garden. He was brought up as Westmacott's own son, went to St Paul's School, where he was admitted as a scholar on 5 May 1800 aged twelve, where his father was described as Richard Molloy, merchant, of Lambeth Marsh. He was said to have trained at the Royal Academy of Arts (though his name does not appear in the index of pupils). On the death of his father, Charles's half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29114/', "Sir Richard Westmacott (1775&#150;1856)")</script>, later professor of sculpture, sent him away penniless, but by his own ability he rose to become proprietor and editor of a scandalous tory journal, the <span class="italic">Age</span>, with which his name was principally associated.<br>
<br>Westmacott soon acquired a reputation for publishing pseudo-satirical gossip with a view to extortion. Guilty or innocent, the persons he accused would pay either to be kept out of his paper or to have their names cleared. Thus he allegedly extorted &pound;5000 from Sir Herbert Taylor, acting for the royal family, in a single scandalous court intrigue that concerned the parentage of Captain Thomas Garth, son of Princess Sophia, between 1828 and 1830. His notebooks, offered for sale in the catalogue of Thomas Arthur (December 1868), are described as having contained intimate details relating to George IV, Princess Caroline, Beau Brummell, and members of the nobility. By 1834 Westmacott was prosperous and possessed a pretty cottage between Barnes and Richmond, its grounds adorned with sculptures. In 1841 he was resident at Kingston Lodge, Kingston upon Thames, with an Anne Westmacott&#151;who may have been the Anne Durham in whose name the proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Age</span> had been registered, and who had been described in a court case as &#145;Mr Molloy Westmacott's &#147;poppett&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 July 1829)&#151;and a twelve-year-old boy, Charles Westmacott.<br>
<br>Westmacott began his career by publishing the first thirteen numbers of the <span class="italic">Gazette of Fashion</span> (1822). A regular feature on gambling dens, entitled &#145;Peep into the pandemonium&#146;, exemplifies his blackmailing methods, declaring the existence of &#145;a list of more than 200 names&#146; to be exposed to &#145;merited chastisement&#146; and protesting that the aim was &#145;neither to <i>extort hush-money</i>, [n]or point out <i>individuals</i> to public execration&#146;  (9 February). In June 1827 he purchased the <span class="italic">Age</span> from Richard Downing Richards on the latter's insolvency. Westmacott boosted its weekly sales to about 10,000 by publishing sensational news and heaping abuse on well-known political opponents. <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> (1834), in its comment on his portrait, mentions as &#145;the most characteristic touch &hellip;, the knowing horsewhip in his hat&#146;. Westmacott's vicious criticism made him feared and hated. One insult that was avenged was his denigration of Fanny Kemble's &#145;decidedly bad&#146; figure and diction (&#145;a guttural thickness, tainted with very strong provincialisms&#146;): when he attended a performance at Covent Garden in October 1830 her father, Charles Kemble, so <span class="italic">The News</span> reported, &#145;administered a discipline with a horsewhip&#146;, leaving Westmacott to &#145;roll about the floor and roar&#146;. Edward Bulwer-Lytton also threatened a flogging for an offensive remark. Westmacott's retaliation came in a letter published in 1833 and is referred to in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> as the &#145;crushing without mercy &hellip; [of Bulwer's] volumes &hellip; beneath his foot&#146;. He sold the <span class="italic">Age</span> in 1838, and in 1839 began the <span class="italic">Argus</span>.<br>
<br>Westmacott's training as an artist shows in two of his publications. <span class="italic">British Galleries of Painting and Sculpture</span> (1824) is a serious work which claims to describe all the &#145;Palaces, Mansions, and Galleries &hellip; in the Kingdom&#146;  (p. vii) and to offer a comprehensive catalogue of all the works of art they contain. <span class="italic">A Descriptive and Critical Catalogue to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy &hellip; with a[n] &hellip; Account of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Painting and Sculpture in England</span> (1823) includes in its preface a threatening attack on &#145;the Academicians&#146;, who had wasted &pound;4000 on &#145;a splendid banquet&#146;. He also wrote <span class="italic">Points of Misery, or, Fables for Mankind</span> (1823), with illustrations by Robert Cruikshank, as well as &#145;a musical farce in two acts&#146;, <span class="italic">Nettlewig Hall, or, Ten to One</span> (1829), in fact a conventional prose play in which an elderly guardian is fooled by his clever nephew.<br>
<br>Whether the following works, published under the pseudonym Bernard Blackmantle, were written wholly by Westmacott (as claimed in biographical accounts shortly after his death) cannot be decided with certainty. <span class="italic">The English spy &hellip; satirical and humorous, comprising scenes and sketches in every rank of society</span> (2 vols., 1825&#150;6; new edn, 1907), with illustrations by Robert Cruikshank, is a gossipy miscellany in the tradition of Egan's <span class="italic">Life in London</span>, whose author claims that &#145;from obscurity of birth &hellip; he [has risen] into notice by the &hellip; exertion of his talents&#146; but, unlike Westmacott, he was educated at Eton and Oxford  (1.14&#150;16). The work was continued as the <span class="italic">St James' Royal Magazine, and Monthly Gazette of Fashion</span> (1826). <span class="italic">Fitzalleyne of Berkeley: a Romance of the Present Times</span> (2 vols., 1825) deals with the Berkeley peerage scandal and with illegitimacy, issues which would have attracted Westmacott, in whose <span class="italic">Gazette of Fashion</span> &#145;Fitz-Allan&#146; features as an anonymous correspondent signing the <span class="roman">Pandemonium</span> columns. <span class="italic">The Punster's Pocket-Book, or, The Art of Punning Enlarged</span> (1826), illustrated by Cruikshank, refers back to &#145;The Art of Punning [1719] &hellip; ascribed to Dr. Swift &hellip; [but] written by Dr. Sheridan&#146;  (p. 68). It reprints verbatim, in two parts  (pp. 84&#150;5 and 94&#150;6) a fake letter to the editor of the <span class="italic">Gazette of Fashion</span>, &#145;On the vice of punning&#146; (9 February 1822).<br>
<br>Wrongly attributed to Westmacott was the Shakespeare burlesque <span class="italic">Othello, the Moor of Fleet Street</span>, now recognized as the work of Charles Mathews. There is also no evidence that under the pseudonym Abel Funnefello he wrote <span class="italic">The Blue-Coat Boy</span> (1837).<br>
<br>In the introduction to <span class="italic">Nettlewig Hall</span>, Westmacott is described as &#145;a little round man, with a dumpling figure and physiognomy; smart and lively as his farce&#146;  (Westmacott, A3). According to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, he was &#145;a pluck[y] little fellow&#146; who had &#145;pushed his way actively in the world&#146; and had &#145;fought &hellip; the battle of the Tories as open-mouthedly and as freely as he could&#146;. Notorious and wealthy, he boasted of his talents and his intimacy with the nobility, but never got into society. Eventually he was lost sight of in the press and the London salons and slunk away to Paris, where he died on 24 June 1868.<br>
