<span class="headword">Crowdy, Dame  Rachel Eleanor</span>  (1884&#150;1964), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born on 3 March 1884 at 28 Craven Hill Gardens, Paddington, London, the daughter of James Crowdy (<i>d</i>. in or before 1939), solicitor, and his wife, Mary Isabel Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fuidge. One of four sisters including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62129/', "Edith Frances Crowdy")</script>, who were all to develop an active interest in social service in their adult lives, she was educated at Hyde Park New College in London, and at Guy's Hospital where she completed her training as a nurse in 1908. In 1911 she joined the newly formed Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADs), volunteer nursing units attached to the Territorial Army. With characteristic thoroughness, she immediately began to study at Apothecaries' Hall for a certificate to serve as dispenser to her unit, VAD 22, London. Between 1912 and 1914 she was also a lecturer and demonstrator at the National Health Society.<br>
<br>It was through her work for the VADs during the First World War that Rachel Crowdy made her name. With her friend Katharine Furse she broke down the prejudices of both male administrators and professional nurses, setting up first aid and home nursing classes all over the country. The VADs had been trained for the eventuality of invasion, but they managed to send a small group to Boulogne, where they set up a rest station for wounded soldiers in a railway siding. There, during the first battle of Ypres, about twenty nurses ministered to 30,000 men. At the end of 1914 Katharine Furse returned to London and for the rest of the war Rachel Crowdy was in charge of the VADs on the continent. She set up rest stations along the lines of communication in France and Belgium, and established ambulance depots, hostels for nurses and for relatives of the sick and wounded, and hospitals and sickbays wherever they were needed. Before long the VADs had proved themselves so well that the two Crowdy sisters Rachel and Mary could set up an office in the joint war committee centre in the H&ocirc;tel Crystal in Boulogne.<br>
<br>Rachel Crowdy was mentioned in dispatches several times, and received the Royal Red Cross, second class, in 1916 and first class in 1917; in 1919 she was created DBE. Her experiences had tested her courage to the full. They had also helped to make her into an exceptionally firm and determined administrator. In 1919 she became chief of the social questions and opium traffic section at the League of Nations, the only woman to head a section at the league. During her twelve years there she considered a wide range of social problems, becoming best known for her inquiries into the traffic in women and children and into the opium trade. Her work won international acclaim. In 1920&#150;21 she went with the International Typhus Commission to Poland when the epidemic was at its height, and in 1922 she was made a commander of the order of Polonia Restituta. In 1926 Smith College in the United States made her an honorary doctor of laws, and in 1931, at the end of her work for the League of Nations, the Spanish government made her a commander of the order of Alfonso XII &#145;for services of outstanding value in the international field of social reform&#146;.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Dame Rachel's career as a &#145;social worker&#146; (her own description) continued unabated. She was a member of the British delegation to the Conference on Pacific Relations at Shanghai in 1931, having attended the Conference on Pacific Affairs in Honolulu the previous year. She travelled alone to Shanghai, as she did again in 1936, when she returned to Manchuria. She revelled in the freedom to go where she wished and see what she pleased. In 1935&#150;6 she was a member of the royal commission on the private manufacture of and trading in arms. The commission's report concluded that nationalization was impracticable, but recommended some far-reaching British and international regulations, which were not implemented. In 1937 Dame Rachel went with a parliamentary commission to observe the war in Spain. In 1938&#150;9 she served on the West Indies royal commission, whose recommendations included the establishment of a West Indian Welfare Fund. From 1939 to 1946 she served as regions' adviser to the Ministry of Information, her last major appointment in a long and remarkably varied career.<br>
<br>Dame Rachel Crowdy belonged to a generation in which women had to possess very obvious strength of character if they were to attain recognition. She certainly could have been described as &#145;formidable&#146;, but those who knew her found much more besides. Strikingly good-looking and always well turned out, she impressed her colleagues with her incisive mind and quick wit. Her orderliness and other administrative talents tempered an abiding zest for life, a curiosity about people and places which seemed to be insatiable, and a feeling for poetry and visual beauty which was reflected in the vivid and graceful language of her many lectures to audiences all over the world. On 13 December 1939 she married Colonel Cudbert John Massy Thornhill CMG DSO (1883&#150;1952), the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry Beaufoy Thornhill. Dame Rachel died of coronary thrombosis at her home, Sheppards, Outwood, Surrey, on 10 October 1964, at the age of eighty.<br>
