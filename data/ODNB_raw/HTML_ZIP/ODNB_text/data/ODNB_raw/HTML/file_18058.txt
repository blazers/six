<span class="headword">Marianus Scottus</span> <span class="st"> [Muiredach mac Robartaig]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1080<span class="mult">x</span>83), <span class="occ">scribe</span>, was the founder of the Irish monastic community at Regensburg, Bavaria, from which developed the Irish Benedictine congregation in southern Germany, the Schottenkl&ouml;ster. His name in Irish is given in his own hand as &#145;Muredach macc Robartaig&#146; in the colophon of his copy of the Pauline epistles now in Vienna. The patronymic (which was probably by this time a surname) shows him as of the family of north Donegal who were traditionally guardians of the early seventh-century psalter codex known as the <span class="italic">Cathach</span> of St Columba. The case (<i>cumhdach</i>) of the <span class="italic">Cathach</span> was commissioned between 1062 and 1098 by Domnall Mac Robartaig, who was coarb (successor) of Columba at Kells. He and Muiredach seem likely to have been closely related, perhaps brothers, while Domnall's predecessor but one as coarb, Robartach mac Ferdomnaig (<i>d</i>. 1057), may conceivably have been their father.<br>
<br>Marianus left Ireland with a group of companions <i>c</i>.1068, originally intending to go to Rome. According to the <span class="italic">Vita Mariani Scotti</span> (composed between 1177 and 1185 by a monk of the Schottenkl&ouml;ster at Regensburg), he resided for about a year at the monastery of Michaelsberg at Bamberg in Bavaria before proceeding to Regensburg in the footsteps of a certain Mercherdach (<i>d</i>. 1075), who had settled there as an incluse attached to the cloister of Oberm&uuml;nster <i>c</i>.1040. At Regensburg, Marianus was received by the nuns of the cloister of Niederm&uuml;nster, on whose behalf he transcribed many sacred books, and rapidly gained a reputation for sanctity. Later, <i>c</i>.1075, he was granted leave by the abbess of Oberm&uuml;nster to move with his companions to a dependency of her monastery, the small church of Weih St Peter on the outskirts of the city, where anchorite cells were specially constructed. About 1077 Marianus was joined at Weih St Peter by E&oacute;in (Johannes), also a known scribe, who in 1083 completed a manuscript (now at Edinburgh) begun by Marianus three years before. From this it is inferred that Marianus's death occurred in or soon after 1080. 9 February is the date given in the Bollandist edition of his life, based on a note in the source manuscript, but this is not corroborated. He was buried at Weih St Peter (site demolished in 1552).<br>
<br>After Marianus's death the community at Weih St Peter adopted the Benedictine rule and underwent rapid expansion due to an influx of newcomers from Ireland. About 1089 a second Irish foundation was established at St Jakob in Regensburg, and in the course of the twelfth century this became the mother house of a congregation numbering some dozen houses of Irish Benedictines in southern Germany.<br>
<br>Two manuscripts by Marianus Scottus are extant, one written entirely in his hand, and a second partially so. The one in Vienna  (&Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. lat. 1247) was written by Marianus in the first half of 1079 and contains a copy of the Pauline epistles with copious commentary and other marginalia, including the signature &#145;Marianus Scottus&#146; which is entered on the verso of the final leaf and glossed in Irish in the form given above. The other codex, formerly in the Benedictine abbey of Fort Augustus and presently housed in the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh (Rat. 1), consists of eight ascetical treatises of which the first six are in Marianus's hand and the remainder in the hand of Johannes. According to marginalia in a mixture of Irish and Latin, Marianus was writing during the months of June and July 1080. Marianus's hand has also been identified (by Bernhard Bischoff) in occasional marginalia entered in a ninth-century <span class="roman">Bible</span> codex from the library of Niederm&uuml;nster  (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 12741). A further manuscript written by him containing the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and excerpts from the Christian fathers is known only from the text of a colophon cited by fifteenth-century Bavarian sources in which the date of writing is given as 1074, which is specified as the seventh year of Marianus's exile.<br>
