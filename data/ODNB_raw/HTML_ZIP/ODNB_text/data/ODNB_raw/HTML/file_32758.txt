<span class="headword">Day,  William Henry</span>  (1823&#150;1908), <span class="occ">racehorse breeder and trainer</span>, born on 9 August 1823 at Danebury, Hampshire, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39781/', "John Barham Day (1793&#150;1860)")</script> and an Irish woman whose surname was Goddard. His father, known as Honest John, founded the famous Danebury racing stable, where he had for patrons the duke of Grafton, Lord George Bentinck, and Lord Palmerston, among many others. His grandfather John Day of Houghton Down Farm, Stockbridge, was racing adviser to the prince of Wales (later George IV) and acquired the reputation of being able at a sitting to drink two more bottles of wine than any of his companions. He was the Gloomy Day depicted in a celebrated caricature made by Robert Dighton on the Steyne at Brighton in 1801.<br>
<br>William was educated privately with his cousin Russell Day, afterwards a Church of England priest and a master at Eton College, by his uncle Henry Thomas Day LLD, rector of Mendlesham, Suffolk. After entering his father's stable at Danebury, he acquired some fame as a jockey, and rode Lord George Bentinck's horse Grey Momus when it won the Ascot Cup in 1838. His eldest brother, John (1814&#150;1882), was to succeed the father at Danebury; consequently William started training at Woodyates, Cranborne Chase, Dorset. There on the downs he trained many good winners, usually ridden by his brother Alfred. These included James Merry's Lord of the Isles and his own Promised Land, which carried off the Two Thousand Guineas in 1855 and 1859 respectively, Sir F. Johnstone's Brigantine, which won the Oaks and Ascot Cup in 1869, and many good handicap horses. Day also won in 1859 the Goodwood Cup with Promised Land, which finished fourth in the Derby. Day's patrons included Lord Ribblesdale, the marquess of Anglesey, Lord Coventry, and Lord Westmorland. In 1846 he married his cousin Ellen, daughter of James Day, veterinary surgeon, of Kenford, Devon. They had five sons.<br>
<br>In 1873 Day sold off his stud, which realized over &pound;25,000. For a time he gave up training, but resumed operations in 1881, when J. R. Keene sent him some horses, including Foxhall, which won the Grand Prix, the Cesarewitch, and the Cambridgeshire in 1881, and the Ascot Cup in 1882. Day afterwards trained a few horses at Salisbury, but finally retired in 1892. In 1873 he had formed a large breeding stud at Alvediston, near Salisbury, having over sixty thoroughbred brood mares. Cast-off, the dam of Robert-the-Devil, winner of the St Leger in 1880, was bred there, and for a time Flying Duchess, the dam of Galopin, the Derby winner of 1875, was also at Alvediston.<br>
<br>Day used his experiences at Alvediston in writing <span class="italic">The Horse: how to Breed and Rear him</span> (1888). He also wrote several articles on turf politics in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>. His <span class="italic">The Racehorse in Training</span> (1880), which was translated into French, was one of the first attempts to treat the subject scientifically; his two volumes of memoirs are rather less reliable.<br>
<br>Of medium height, but tall for a jockey, and possessed of an iron will, Day was a model man of business. Like his father, who, on Sunday evenings, used to read Hugh Blair's sermons to the stable lads until they fell asleep, he was most punctilious in the discharge of his religious duties. He was only too well aware of the temptations which racing presented. For his patrons he won stakes to the value of over &pound;200,000. At one time a comparatively rich man, he lost the bulk of his fortune by speculating in poor land. Day died at Shirley, Southampton, on 29 August 1908, and was buried by the side of his wife at the parish church, Pentridge, near Cranborne Chase, Dorset.<br>
