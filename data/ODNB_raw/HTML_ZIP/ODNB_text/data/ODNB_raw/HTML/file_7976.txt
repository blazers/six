<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Downes,  William</span>, first Baron Downes  (1751&#150;1826), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Donnybrook, co. Dublin, the third and youngest son of the six children of Robert (Robin) Downes (1708&#150;1754) of Donnybrook (MP for Kildare, 1735&#150;54), and of Elizabeth (Lily), daughter of Thomas Twigg, also of Donnybrook; he was grandson of Dive Downes, bishop of Cork (<i>d</i>. 1709). He was aged only two or three when his father was found dying in the parlour of their home in Dawson Street, Dublin, with a sword run through his body; the circumstances were never explained.<br>
<br>In 1768 Downes entered Trinity College, Dublin, from which he graduated BA in 1773, the same year that he was admitted to the Middle Temple. He was called to the Irish bar in 1776, and soon acquired a reputation for industry and competence. In 1788 he successfully defended the future Major-General Gillespie, who had been charged with the murder of Sir Jonah Barrington's brother. The Irish government thought sufficiently highly of Downes to arrange in 1790 for his election as an MP for Donegal borough, a seat that lay within its gift. Two years later he was made a puisne judge in the Irish king's bench. Although criminal business constituted but a portion of Downes's judicial work it was here that his performance was most jealously scrutinized. Conservative critics were not always impressed, the presumed pro-defence stance of the judge in a high-profile 1796 trial causing one complainant to label Downes &#145;a phlegmatic, cowardly heap&#146;  (McDowell, 547).<br>
<br>The rising of the United Irishmen in 1798 and the manner of that rising's suppression had a profound effect on Downes, both as judge and man. He was distressed by the execution after court-martial in June of that year of an old friend, Sir Edward Crosbie. &#145;The melancholy situation of the country&#146;, Downes confided in July, &#145;has so much heated the minds of most people &hellip; that a ready ear is lent to reports which tend to criminate&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Accurate and Impartial Narrative of the Appeal, Trial and Execution of Sir E. W. Crosbie, Bart.</span>, 94). In October he remonstrated with Castlereagh, the Irish chief secretary, over an incident that had occurred on the opening day of the assizes at Waterford. As presiding judge Downes had been shocked to learn that that morning six &#145;rebels&#146; scheduled to be tried before him had been transferred into military custody:<blockquote>The law cannot appear to the public to be weak without losing that respect which it ought to have with the people especially if they shall feel only its terrors, and shall believe it is not strong enough to extend benefits to them. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.14)</blockquote>Downes was promoted to the chief justiceship of king's bench in 1803 to fill the vacancy caused by the murder of Viscount Kilwarden. &#145;As a judge, lawyer and citizen, Downes &hellip; then the senior puisne was by universal admission the fit man&#146;  (Ball, <span class="italic">The Judges in Ireland</span>, 2.244). Three years later he was given an honorary LLD on becoming vice-chancellor of the University of Dublin, a position he held until his death.<br>
<br>Downes was to fill the office of chief justice for nearly nineteen years. Few specimens of his written judgments survive, but both these and contemporary accolades indicate that he contributed a good deal to such dignity as the immediate post-union Irish bench was able to muster. This praise counted for little in the turbulent years that preceded Catholic emancipation, however, and in 1812, in a deteriorating political atmosphere and in what was a remarkable twist to events, Downes himself was to be sued over the arrest of a prominent Catholic, an arrest that he had personally sanctioned under the terms of the <span class="roman">Irish Convention Act</span> of 1793: <i>Taaffe v. Downes</i>. Taaffe's suit failed. Downes's conduct of the trial of John Magee the following year, on a charge of criminal libel, in turn incensed the government. Daniel O'Connell, Magee's defence counsel, had mounted a savage attack on Dublin Castle rule. Peel, as chief secretary, was horrified at Downes's indulgence of O'Connell, and expressed the hope to a correspondent that the chief justice would not &#145;allow the court to be again insulted and made the vehicle of treason&#146;  (Parker, 1.117). O'Connell, for his part, did not reciprocate the indulgence, variously describing Downes as a &#145;scoundrel&#146; and a &#145;plausible tool of bigotry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell</span>, 2.152, 384).<br>
<br>Downes resigned the office of chief justice in February 1822, on a pension of &pound;3800 a year. On 10 December he was created Baron Downes of Aghanville in King's county, with a special remainder in favour of his cousin Sir Ulysses Burgh. About 1805 Downes had bought Merville, near Stillorgan in co. Dublin, a property then reputed to possess the best garden in Ireland. Downes died at Merville on 3 March 1826 and, like his two elder brothers, died unmarried. At his special request he was buried in the same tomb in the vault of St Ann's Church in Dawson Street, Dublin, as a colleague and fellow king's bench judge, William Tankerville Chamberlain (1751&#150;1802), who had been laid to rest some twenty years earlier. An inscription in the church records: &#145;Their friendship and union was complete. They had studied together, lived together, sat together on the same bench of justice, and now by the desire of the survivor they lie together in the same tomb.&#146;<br>
