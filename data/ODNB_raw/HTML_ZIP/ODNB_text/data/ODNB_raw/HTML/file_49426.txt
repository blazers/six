<span class="headword">&AElig;thelric</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1034), <span class="occ">bishop of Dorchester</span>, was a former monk of Ramsey and a generous patron of his monastery. His election to the see of Dorchester in 1016 perhaps owed something to his family connections, although these are unknown. Given the extent and geographical location of this large see, it was perhaps believed that a local man would prove to be the most effective bishop. During his early years at the monastic school in Ramsey, &AElig;thelric and three more &#145;noble youths&#146; once climbed up among the bells, and accidentally cracked one. Abbot Eadnoth (993&#150;1006) refused to expel them, arguing that in later years they might be in a position to assist the monastery.<br>
<br>Bishop &AElig;thelric was concerned that good disciplinary standards should be maintained at Ramsey. When the unpopular Abbot Withman complained of the monks' lack of discipline, &AElig;thelric paid a visit in disguise, and saw for himself that the monks were well-behaved. He censured the abbot for making false allegations about them, but at the same time ordered the monks to be obedient towards Withman. On another occasion, abbot and monks alike were proved to be negligent, but when they humbly submitted to &AElig;thelric's criticisms he granted them some land. Having decided to acquire for Ramsey the relics of St Felix, which were located in the royal manor of Soham, &AElig;thelric obtained the permission of King Cnut for the transfer, and prompted &AElig;thelstan, the abbot of Ramsey, to send a party to Soham by boat, to seize the body. The Ramsey chronicle tells of a miraculous mist which prevented the hostile intervention of a group of monks from Ely.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelric's episcopate coincided with a wave of Danish settlement in the wake of Cnut's invasion. He brought a court case against the powerful Danish magnate Thorkell the Tall, then regent in England during Cnut's absence, accusing his wife of the murder of her stepson. Only after Cnut's return to England was Thorkell brought to court, where his attempt to clear his wife by swearing on his beard failed when the beard came away in his hand. The stepson's grave was discovered and the wife convicted of murder. Thorkell was judged guilty of perjury, and of flouting the bishop's jurisdiction, and in compensation gave land to &AElig;thelric, who granted it to Ramsey. Rather more apocryphal is a story of &AElig;thelric winning an estate in a bet with a drunken Dane. &AElig;thelric died in 1034 and was buried at Ramsey Abbey.<br>
