<span class="headword">Cooper, Sir  Astley Paston</span>, first baronet  (1768&#150;1841), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 23 August 1768 at Brooke Hall, Norfolk, about 7 miles from Norwich, the fourth son and sixth child of the ten children born to the Revd <a name="cosubject_6227"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Cooper</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1739, <em>d.</em> 1800)<span class="occ"></span>, and Maria Susanna Bransby (1737&#150;1807) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47163/', "Cooper, Maria Susanna")</script>], daughter of James Bransby, a gentleman from Shotesham, about 3 miles from Brooke. Both families were solidly middle-class; Samuel Cooper studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge (BA, 1760; DD, 1770), and was ordained a priest in 1763. He was the author of several volumes of sermons, commentaries, and poems, and, from 1781, the incumbent of a large parish in Great Yarmouth. His wife wrote children's books and sentimental novels. Their surviving sons were successful (the eldest, Robert Bransby, was an author and member of parliament), but their five daughters and one son died young from consumption. Astley Cooper later requested that his own post-mortem examination should include particular attention to his lungs, where evidence of old tuberculosis was found.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>As a youth Cooper was a notorious prankster, with little inclination to book learning. He found his early education, mostly at home and locally, a desultory experience, but his thoughts turned towards surgery after a dramatic accident claimed the life, from bleeding, of a foster brother, and his subsequent witnessing of an impressive operation for the stone by a Mr Donnee, surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. Cooper's maternal grandfather had been a prosperous surgeon in Norwich, and his uncle William Cooper was senior surgeon at Guy's Hospital in London. Accordingly, in August 1784, Cooper was articled to his uncle, arrangements being made for him to reside in the house of Henry Cline, surgeon at nearby St Thomas's Hospital. A student of John Hunter, Cline quickly became Cooper's patron and the formal apprenticeship was switched to him. Cooper also attended Hunter's lectures and acquired from both his mentors an aptitude for dissection and experimentation that never left him.<br>
<br>Cooper's London studies were interrupted by a serious attack of fever, requiring convalescence in Great Yarmouth during the summer of 1787, and by a seven-month stay from the autumn in Edinburgh, where he attended the lectures of James Gregory, James Hamilton, William Cullen, and Joseph Black, and actively participated in two debating societies. Back in London for the 1788 academic session Cooper resumed his pupillage with Cline and his attendance at Hunter's lectures. He became Cline's anatomy demonstrator the following year, and in 1791 Cline invited him to share in the lectures of his combined course on anatomy and surgery. In the same year Cooper became engaged to Anne Cock, the only daughter of a wealthy retired merchant then living in Tottenham in north London&#151;a friend of Cline and an early patient of Cooper. Mr Cock dying on the very day of their proposed marriage, the young couple delayed a month before marrying privately, in December 1791. Although the marriage was by all accounts happy, its subsequent tone was set by the fact that Cooper delivered his anatomy lecture as usual on the evening of his wedding. The Coopers resided for several years in a house in Jefferies Square which his father-in-law had purchased and equipped for them, in addition to providing his daughter with a dowry of &pound;14,000.<br>
<br>Besides learning anatomy from Cline, Cooper also absorbed some of his republican, democratic principles. These were tried but not obliterated by four months that the Coopers spent in revolutionary Paris from June 1792. They witnessed the atrocities of the reign of terror, and Cooper attended the lectures and operations of the surgeons Desault and Chopart; much later he wrote that revolutions may be good for posterity, but not for the existing generation. They returned to London in September, just two months before the birth of their only child, Anna Maria, who died in March 1794. They subsequently adopted a daughter, Sarah, who was the same age as their dead child, and a son, Astley, who was a nephew of Cooper's.<h2>
<a name="Establishingareputation"></a>Establishing a reputation</h2>Cooper's financial security enabled him to devote the 1790s almost exclusively to his teaching at St Thomas's and to his dissections. He wisely separated the lectures in anatomy from those in surgery, the latter necessitating attendance in the surgical wards of the hospital. It took him some time to distance himself from the philosophical style of Hunter's own surgical lectures, but the latter's death in 1793 left Cooper and John Abernethy of St Bartholomew's Hospital as the main rivals for the Hunterian crown. As Cooper's surgical experience deepened, his lectures became more practical in their orientation, based primarily on his own cases. He was a systematic note-taker, and this, combined with a prodigious memory, enabled him to develop a comprehensive course in surgery. He was a doer rather than a reader, and during three decades his surgical lectures were central educational features for thousands of medical students attracted by the London hospitals and their medical teachers. As was common in an era when student fees constituted an important source of income for teachers, Cooper did not rush to publish a textbook. However, the successive compilations based on his mature lectures, beginning with <span class="italic">Outlines of Lectures on Surgery</span> (1820), between them had gone through ten editions by 1839, in addition to four American editions and several German translations. More than many textbooks, these volumes represented print versions of what Cooper actually taught. Despite the print edition of the first of these publications, Thomas Wakley shrewdly chose Cooper's lectures to reproduce in the first issue of his new journal, <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, in 1823.<br>
<br>From 1793 until 1796 Cooper was also lecturer in anatomy at the Company of Surgeons (after 1800 the Royal College of Surgeons). In 1797 he took over the larger house at 12 St Mary Axe, vacated by Cline. This provided more room for both his experimental work and for his comparative and human dissections. He accidentally left behind a live viper in his old house and once dissected an elephant in the front garden of his new one, throwing a carpet over the railings to conceal it from public view. He moved to Broad Street in 1806 and then to New Street in 1815. In 1800 his uncle resigned as surgeon to Guy's Hospital and Cooper applied for the post. Advised by the hospital's secretary that his chances would be much improved were he to renounce his earlier political views and continued association with friends of democratic principles, Cooper decided on reflection that a surgeon should be a man for all parties and discontinued any active involvement in politics. He was comfortably elected to the Guy's post, and the income from his surgical practice almost doubled within the year.<h2>
<a name="PreeminentLondonsurgeon"></a>Pre-eminent London surgeon</h2>Although Cooper always took his teaching seriously, he also practised his craft among all classes. Tall and handsome, and with an easy manner, he attracted a large number of wealthy and influential patients, including Lord Liverpool, the duke of York, the duke of Wellington, and the prince of Wales, who, as George IV, created him baronet in 1821 following the successful removal of a painful cyst from the king's scalp. By Cooper's request the baronetcy descended to his adopted nephew, also named Astley Cooper. Much of his practice would now be considered medical rather than surgical, and he was known as a good diagnostician who trusted only a few medicines. His income in his peak years exceeded &pound;20,000, and he was once given 1000 guineas after a successful removal of a bladder stone. His practice was of such legendary profitability that an impostor successfully practised for a time under his name in south London.<br>
<br>Within the limits of surgery before anaesthesia and antiseptics, Cooper was an outstanding operator, precise and quick. He himself wrote that he was not so good when delicacy was required, as in cataract surgery, but he was prepared to take on most of what was then the surgical repertoire. He could even innovate. Like Hunter before him, Cooper was especially interested in the surgical treatment of arterial aneurysms, and used animals to investigate the development of collateral circulation following the surgical occlusion of an artery. He operated on patients suffering from carotid aneurysms, the second of his patients surviving for thirteen years, though an even more dramatic operation to tie the aorta in a patient with an aortic aneurysm resulted in his patient's death forty hours later. He also successfully ligated the external iliac artery for a patient with a femoral aneurysm. He advocated the use of catgut in arterial surgery, that suturing material having the advantage of being gradually absorbed.<br>
<br>Cooper's standing was recognized by his surgical colleagues. He was elected professor of comparative anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1813, a post he resigned two years later. He became a member of the court of examiners of the college in 1822, and he served as president twice, in 1827 and 1836. He was also a vice-president of the Royal Society, to whose fellowship he had been elected in 1802, and won the society's Copley medal. His publications reflected his twin passions of anatomy and surgery, his first monograph, on hernias (published in two parts between 1804 and 1807), being stimulated by his own inguinal hernia which he had noticed while still a student. The description of the anatomy of the inguinal area was especially important. Cooper also produced treatises on fractures and dislocations (1822; sixth edition, 1829), the diseases of the breast (1829) and testis (1830), and the anatomy of the thymus gland (1832) and the breast (1840). He paid particular attention to high-quality illustrations, drawn by a succession of artists that he himself employed. His monographs contain a number of his notable surgical and anatomical observations and are based almost entirely on his own work, done singly or with various of his pupils and associates.<br>
<br>Cooper was loyal to his articled pupils, and such was his influence that he expected them to land the top jobs. Wakley assaulted this nepotism in the early volumes of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. Later, when Cooper's nephew Bransby Cooper did not succeed his uncle as anatomy lecturer at St Thomas's Hospital when he retired in 1825, Cooper prevailed on the Guy's secretary to establish a separate school there, with Bransby teaching anatomy and another pupil, Aston Key, becoming the lecturer in surgery. The museum at St Thomas's, which he had built up, stayed behind; instead Cooper helped Guy's to establish its own anatomical and surgical museum. Many of its specimens came from his dissections, often supplied by body snatchers. Cooper was quite open about the inadequate number of bodies for anatomy teaching available through legal means, before the <span class="roman">Anatomy Act</span> of 1832. He famously remarked to the House of Commons select committee on anatomy in 1828 that no dead person, however exalted, was safe from the activities of the resurrectionists: &#145;The law only enhances the price, and does not prevent the exhumation.&#146;<h2>
<a name="Windingdown"></a>Winding down</h2>Cooper began to suffer from occasional dizzy spells in the 1820s, and his wife's death in 1827 prompted him to retire from all his London activities. He had already purchased an estate at Gadesbridge, near Hemel Hempstead, where his wife had lived for several years. He soon tired of farming, however, and after marrying Catherine Jones in 1828 entered into a kind of Indian summer. He became adept at treating farm animals, especially horses, which he acquired lame and nursed and fed back to saleable health. He reopened his London surgical practice, this time in Conduit Street, and went on several continental tours, where he met many leading medical figures. He also received honorary degrees from Oxford and Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Cooper was a man of enormous energy who generally dissected for two or three hours before breakfast. Temperate in his habits, he was nevertheless sociable and active in several societies, including the Physical Society at Guy's, the Medico-Chirurgical Society, of which he was a founder member, and the Pow-Wow, a medical dining club started by John Hunter. He was a good athlete who valued the role of sport, and he hosted shooting parties at his estate.<br>
<br>Cooper's health gave way in 1840, and after developing signs of congestive heart failure he died in Conduit Street on 12 February 1841. He had left instructions for a post-mortem examination to be conducted, and he directed his dissectors to pay particular attention to several points associated with his own medical history and to publish the autopsy report. He was buried on 20 February in the chapel of Guy's Hospital. His will endowed an essay competition at Guy's; a memorial statue was erected in St Paul's Cathedral, and his fine portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence is in the possession of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
