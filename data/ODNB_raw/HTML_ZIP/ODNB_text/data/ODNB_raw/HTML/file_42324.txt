<span class="headword">Romanes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Duncan]</span>,  Ethel</span>  (1856&#150;1927), <span class="occ">writer and religious activist</span>, was born at Ashfield, Wavertree, Lancashire, on 15 August 1856, the daughter and heir of Andrew Duncan, a general merchant, and his wife, Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Radcliffe. She was educated privately. On 11 February 1879 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24038/', "George John Romanes (1848&#150;1894)")</script>, son of George Romanes and his wife, Isabella Gair Smith. Romanes, a physiologist and a close friend and disciple of Charles Darwin, had met Ethel in the house of her cousin and guardian, Sir James Malcolm of Balbedie and Grange, Fife.<br>
<br>The marriage was one of &#145;extreme happiness&#146;, and the Romanes had six children, five boys and a girl, to whom George Romanes was &#145;an ideal father, tender, sympathetic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 92, 143). The family lived in London and, from 1890, Oxford, holidaying at Geanies, a rented house in Ross-shire. With her husband, Ethel Romanes read French scientific books, lent by Darwin, and she furthered a progressive education for her children: they were taught to swim at an early age, and Ethel Georgina, their only daughter, attended Wycombe Abbey School and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Mrs Romanes herself sat on the council of the Froebel Society, where, she said, &#145;with the exception of Mr Claude Montefiore and myself, no one &hellip; ever smiled&#146;  (Romanes, <span class="italic">Story of an English Sister</span>, 2). After her husband's early death on 23 May 1894, she solaced herself by writing <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of George John Romanes</span> (1896), an appealing biography which went into several editions.<br>
<br>The Romanes had been moving in intellectual, scientific, and Anglo-Catholic circles, often based in Oxford: friends&#151;with whom Ethel Romanes continued to associate after her husband's death&#151;included the Moberley family, Charles Gore, Elizabeth Wordsworth, Sir John and Lady Burdon-Sanderson, G. W. E. Russell, and Lord Halifax. Her spiritual commitment seems to have deepened in these years, and she published a series of short devotional works, including <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Penitential Psalms</span> (1902), which had a preface by Henry Scott Holland, <span class="italic">Meditations on the Epistle of S. James</span> (1903), and <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Beatitudes</span> (1910). In 1905 she attended a meeting of the Church of England's National Union of Women Workers with her daughter, and in 1908 she sat on the councils of the Pan-Anglican Congress, on which she subsequently lectured in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Both she and Ethel Georgina were members of the Christian Social Union, and Mrs Romanes also attended conferences on missions and rescue work, at which she sometimes spoke. She had built up a reputation as a lecturer on Dante and theological subjects, and in spring 1914 she had been invited to speak as far afield as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.<br>
<br>In 1907 Ethel Romanes published her <i>magnum opus</i>, a popular account of the seventeenth-century Jansenists entitled <span class="italic">The Story of Port Royal</span>. As several contemporary reviewers pointed out, she had little to add to the magisterial work on the subject (1840&#150;59) by Charles Augustin Saint-Beuve. Nevertheless, the work is very readable and contains a sympathetic commentary on Pascal's <span class="italic">Pens&eacute;es</span>, which George Romanes had been reading shortly before his death. The critic of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> disliked the &#145;consistent drawing of the moral in favour of the High Church party in the English church&#146;, but admired her &#145;industry and enthusiasm for her subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 8 June 1907, 696). <span class="italic">Port Royal</span> was followed in 1908 by the best-known of her publications, <span class="italic">Charlotte Mary Yonge: an Appreciation</span>, an affectionate but not uncritical memoir of a much admired friend which supplemented the more extensive biography by Christabel Coleridge. Her daughter, Ethel, found it &#145;quite delightful &hellip; so enthusiastic and living&#146;  (Romanes, <span class="italic">Story of an English Sister</span>, 141). Mrs Romanes also contributed articles to James Hastings's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> and wrote for the <span class="italic">Church Quarterly</span>.<br>
<br>The second decade of the new century was a troubled one for Mrs Romanes: her eldest son, Ernest, died in 1910, and in 1915 his brother Giles was killed in the Dardanelles. In 1918 Ethel Georgina, who had recently entered an Anglican sisterhood, died after a painful illness. In the wake of these griefs, Ethel Romanes became a convert to Roman Catholicism in 1919. As a Catholic she published two novels, <span class="italic">A Great Mistake</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">Anne Chichester</span> (1925), served on the committee of the Catholic Truth Society, and was active in the Converts' Aid Society. In the last half of her life she lived in a flat in London, frequently staying at Pitcalzean in Ross-shire, which was inherited from her husband's family. She died on 30 March 1927 at Santa Margherita in Italy. Her son Norman Hugh, who was converted to Catholicism in 1927, became the head of the Chiswick Press.<br>
