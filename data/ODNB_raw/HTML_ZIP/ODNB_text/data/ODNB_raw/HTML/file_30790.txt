<span class="headword">Barnard,  Howard Clive</span>  (1884&#150;1985), <span class="occ">educational historian</span>, was born on 7 June 1884 at 11 King Edward Street in the heart of the City of London, the only child of Howard Barnard, journalist, and his wife, Sarah Ann Haggis. During the eighteenth century his ancestors established a firm of silversmiths in the City of London, and so became associated with the Goldsmiths' Company. Barnard was sixth in a direct line going back to about 1760 to become &#145;by patrimony&#146; a member of this company and a freeman of the City. He was educated at University College School, London, when it was still in Gower Street, and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was a senior Hulme scholar. After taking third classes in both classical honour moderations (1905) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1907) he was awarded a post-graduate scholarship for a further four years of study. This enabled him to pursue his interest in geography at the London School of Economics and to become a wandering scholar for a year, primarily at the universities of Heidelberg and Caen, where he perfected his German and French. Back at Oxford, he took a diploma in education with distinction and completed a BLitt thesis, &#145;The educational theory and practice of the Port-Royalists&#146;, which was published two years later by the Cambridge University Press as <span class="italic">The Little Schools of Port-Royal</span> (1913). At twenty-nine, he had embarked on what was to be a prolific literary career. Meanwhile, he married in 1910 Edith Gwendolen (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of John Wish, a civil servant. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Barnard's career as a schoolmaster got under way in 1911. At Manchester grammar school, Chatham House School in Ramsgate, and Bradford grammar school, he served as assistant master, being variously responsible for teaching German, English, and geography. Then in 1925 he moved to the headmastership of Gillingham grammar school, Kent, guiding it through a rapid expansion during his twelve years there. In 1937, at a time when it was unusual for a practising teacher to take up a professorship, he moved to the chair of education at Reading; but by then his distinction as a scholar ran parallel with his distinction as teacher and headmaster.<br>
<br>As scholar and historian, Barnard had been given stimulus and encouragement by his association with King's College, London, where, by a liberal interpretation of the term, he considered himself a part-time &#145;advanced student&#146;. It was through his connection with King's College, and in particular with professors John Dover Wilson and J. W. Adamson, with both of whom he struck up a close friendship, that he became an MA (education) and DLitt of London University.<br>
<br>In 1918 Barnard brought out <span class="italic">The Port-Royalists in Education</span>, and in 1922 <span class="italic">The French Tradition in Education</span>, which remains a classic. It covers the period from the Renaissance to the eve of the French Revolution, exploring in detail the work of educationists and educational institutions, and impresses by its range and depth alike. Four further books, <span class="italic">Madame de Maintenon and Saint-Cyr</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Girls at School under the Ancien r&eacute;gime</span> (1954), <span class="italic">F&eacute;nelon on Education</span> (1966), and <span class="italic">Education and the French Revolution</span> (1969), testify to his unflagging interest in French education and became standard works on the subject. Other notable books are <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Geography Teaching</span> (1933), <span class="italic">A Short History of English Education, from 1760 to 1944</span> (1974), a textbook well known to generations of students, and a splendid autobiographical account of his Victorian childhood, <span class="italic">Were those the Days?</span> (1970).<br>
<br>Ease of scholarship and an enviable limpidity of style characterized both his writing and lecturing, and Barnard was warmly admired by students and colleagues alike. By nature he was modest, detached, slightly impersonal. He lived to be the &#145;grand old man&#146; of the university, but typically denied that there was any merit in being old.<br>
<br>For more than thirty years after his retirement Barnard regularly returned to the university to play the organ in the great hall. In the same hall, Reading University conferred an honorary DLitt on him in 1974; and it was there that family, students, friends, and colleagues held a commemorative service shortly after he died in a nursing home near Godalming, Surrey, on 12 September 1985 at the revered age of 101.<br>
