<span class="headword">Cottle,  Thomas John</span>  (1761&#150;1828), <span class="occ">plantation owner and philanthropist</span>, was the eldest of the four children of Thomas Cottle (1726&#150;1765), solicitor-general of St Kitts, Leeward Islands, West Indies. Cottle inherited the Round Hill plantation on the neighbouring island of Nevis from his father. He became a member of the Nevis island council in 1794, and was its president at various periods between 1803 and 1816. In February or March 1803 he married Frances Huggins, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53032/', "Edward Huggins")</script>. They had three children, one of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Nevis gained notoriety in 1810 when Cottle's father-in-law, an irascible planter, subjected thirty-two of his slaves, men and women, to a brutal flogging in Charlestown market place. This was witnessed by a number of visitors to the island and led to a public outcry in England. Cottle wrote a defence of Huggins's general character, published in 1811, but this may have said more for his family loyalty than for his stance on the treatment of slaves, as he did not condone the punishment nor support slavery in principle, although he opposed immediate abolition in the interest of the colonial economy and the interests of the landed proprietors. Though a slave owner himself, Cottle, a devout Anglican, stood out from the vast majority of his fellow planters by his efforts to improve the working conditions of his slaves and by paying Methodist missionaries to educate them and convert them to Christianity.<br>
<br>Such missionaries had been preaching and teaching in the fields since the mid-eighteenth century but the established church had been slow to show any enthusiasm for a ministry to slaves: it was not until 1792 that the Church of England established the Society for the Conversion and Religious Instruction and Education of the Negro Slaves on the West Indian islands under the auspices of Beilby Porteus, bishop of London. As a result, colonial governors were directed to persuade their legislative councils to pass laws ameliorating the conditions of their slaves. Missionary chaplains and schoolmasters were sent out to convert and instruct them, and a local <span class="roman">Slave Amelioration Act</span> was passed in Nevis in 1798. However, by 1812 Nevis still possessed no schools for slaves.<br>
<br>In that year the desultory ministry was shaken up by the arrival of Daniel Davis as rector of St Paul's, Charlestown, himself a planter's son from St Kitts who, while preparing for ordination at Oxford, had become convinced of the evil nature of slavery. Davis's evangelism not only led to the establishment of nineteen schools for slaves on Nevis, but inspired Cottle to build a chapel on his estate. The five parish churches of Nevis were too small even for the planters and their families, many of the plantations, like Round Hill, being far from any church. Cottle's chapel at Round Hill would not simply be a place where slaves could meet, segregated from the parish church, but a place where his own family and his slaves could worship together. The first service was held in the church on 5 May 1824. Davis duly reported to the Conversion Society: &#145;Mr Cottle made it a holiday for all his slaves, they consequently attended, as did many of the ladies and gentlemen of the island&#146;  (LPL, Christian Faith Society F/1, p. 96). The Cottle Church, as the picturesque ruins of its walls and gables are now known, was the first Anglican church in the Caribbean to be built specifically for members of both the white and black communities. Cottle's example was followed from an unexpected quarter by Peter John Huggins, son of the notorious Edward and brother of Frances Cottle, who built a chapel for his slaves on the neighbouring estate of Montravers. Soon the building of such chapels became general practice in other British islands, many of them subsequently becoming parish churches.<br>
<br>Cottle died on Nevis on 1 February 1828 and a memorial tablet was erected at his church, commemorating<blockquote>a fond father and an affectionate husband, a kind relative and sincere friend, and to his negroes a mild and humane master ever anxious to promote their temporal benefit, and proving his regard to their external happiness by the erection of this chapel for their improvement.</blockquote>The tablet was later removed to the nearby parish church of St Thomas, where it remained at the end of the twentieth century pending its return to the Cottle church following the stabilization of the ruin.<br>
