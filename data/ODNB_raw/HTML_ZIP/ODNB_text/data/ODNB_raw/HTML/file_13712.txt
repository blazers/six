<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  Alexander</span>  (1769&#150;1837), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 9 December 1769, the second son of John Hope, second earl of Hopetoun (1704&#150;1781), who had been lord of police for Scotland, and his third wife, Lady Elizabeth (1737&#150;1788), the second daughter of Alexander Leslie, fifth earl of Leven and Melville. Hope was educated at home, and, together with his elder half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13731/', "John Hope, afterwards the fourth earl")</script>, he travelled on the continent with their tutor, Dr John Gillies (1747&#150;1836).<br>
<br>In 1786 Hope became an ensign in the 63rd foot, was made lieutenant in the 64th foot two years later, and in 1791 raised an independent company, which was called up. On 20 July 1791 Hope was appointed lieutenant and captain 1st foot guards. He was one of the officers selected to serve in the light infantry companies which were first added to the regiment in 1793. He served in Flanders in 1794 as brigade major of the guards, under Major-General Gerard Lake, and afterwards as aide-de-camp to Major-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. In the same year he became a major in the 81st foot, and a lieutenant-colonel in the 2nd battalion of the 90th foot from where he transferred in December to the 14th foot while still with the retreating army in the Netherlands. He commanded the 14th during the attack from Buren on Gueldermasen on 8 January 1795. During this action, Hope was severely wounded by a ball which lodged deep in his shoulder, destroying his arm and causing permanent lameness. He received a pension as a consequence.<br>
<br>Hope, who was a strong supporter of the younger Pitt, sat as MP for Dumfries in 1796. He went on to represent Linlithgowshire between 1802 and 1834. He married Georgina Alicia, the daughter of George Brown of Ellistown, on 23 October 1805; they had five sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>He was appointed lieutenant-governor of Tynemouth and Cliff Fort in 1797, and then of Edinburgh Castle in 1798. He was brigade major and assistant adjutant-general of the eastern district in 1798&#150;9. Aged thirty, he was exceptionally young to hold this post. He became a brigadier-general in 1807, and a major-general in 1808. In June 1811 Hope, who was then deputy quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards, under Sir Robert Brownrigg, was appointed governor of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In January 1813 he was sent on a special mission to Sweden to determine the strength of the forces that could co-operate in the forthcoming allied campaign in Germany. Back at Sandhurst, Hope proposed changes in the entrance exam and raising standards for commissioning, given his belief that many applicants &#145;from want of education in childhood either failed to enter, or are rejected after the probationary year&#146;  (Shepperd, 43). In 1819 Hope left Sandhurst to return to his previous post as lieutenant-governor of Edinburgh Castle. He became lieutenant-governor of Chelsea Hospital in 1826, and after serving as colonel of the 5th West India regiment, then of the 74th (Highland) regiment, became colonel of the 14th foot in 1835.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1824 Oxford conferred on Hope the honorary degree of DCL. On the same day, his eldest son, John Thomas Hope, of Christ Church (who died while lieutenant-colonel of the Fife militia in 1835), recited his Newdigate prize poem, &#145;The Arch of Titus&#146;. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13741/', "James Robert Hope-Scott")</script> of Abbotsford was his third son.<br>
<br>It has been reported that Hope held rank in the Austrian army  (Ornsby, 59&#150;60). The Austrian war office did not maintain an army list before 1820; but the archives of the financial department confirm that no officer of the name served between 1773 and 1840. Hope died, a full general and GCB at the lieutenant-governor's house, Chelsea Hospital, London, on 19 May 1837; he was buried in the family vault at Abercorn, Linlithgowshire. His wife survived him.<br>
