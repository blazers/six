<span class="headword">&Oacute; hEodhasa <span class="st"> [O'Hussey]</span>,  Eochaidh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1612), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet</span>, from Ballyhose (Baile &iacute; Eodhasa), Fermanagh, was the son of Maoileachlainn &Oacute;g &Oacute; hEodhasa, a known poet who was head of his name. According to his own evidence &Oacute; hEodhasa trained as a poet at schools in the north (Leath Chuinn) and in Munster (Thomond). His father was probably his principal teacher. His training in Munster took place during the chieftainship of Hugh Maguire, as transpires in the poem &#145;At&aacute;m i gc&aacute;s idir dh&aacute; chomhairle&#146;  (Mac Cionnaith, no. 70) (reliably attributed). This shows him in two minds whether to break off his studies in Thomond to return to Hugh Maguire's household. But his appointment to the Maguires seems to date from the lifetime of Hugh's father C&uacute; Chonnacht, who is addressed in what purports to be the first poem of &Oacute; hEodhasa's tenure as <i>ollamh</i> (or court poet), &#145;Anois molfam M&aacute;g Uidhir&#146;  (Greene). He was to be <i>ollamh</i> to successive Maguire (M&aacute;g Uidhir) chieftains. A special relationship with Hugh Maguire was forged prior to his succession to the chieftainship. The poem &#145;Connradh do cheanglas re hAodh&#146;  (Breatnach, &#145;Covenant&#146;) composed during C&uacute; Chonnacht's lifetime, records how &Oacute; hEodhasa came to undertake to append a quatrain in Hugh's honour to all his compositions, and the praise poem &#145;B&iacute;odh aire ag Ultaibh ar Aodh&#146;  (Mac Cionnaith, no. 75) is also earlier than 1589. Among his numerous later poems for Hugh Maguire are the inaugural ode &#145;Suirgheach sin, a &Eacute;ire &oacute;gh&#146;  (O'Grady, 476&#150;8), the poem asserting his rights as office-holder to Maguire, &#145;M&oacute;r an t-ainm ollamh flatha&#146;  (ibid., 474&#150;5), and the elegy &#145;Fada re hurch&oacute;id &Eacute;ire&#146;  (ibid., 460).<br>
<br>English documents show &Oacute; hEodhasa to have resided at Ballyhose (on Castlehume Lough, Lower Lough Erne, barony of Magheraboy) in the period from 1585 to 1591. A series of pardons was granted to him at this location, the earliest in 1585&#150;6 during the chieftainship of C&uacute; Chonnacht Maguire (<i>d</i>. 1589), who is also mentioned  (<span class="italic">Fiants of Elizabeth</span>, no. 4810), and thereafter in 1591 as a &#145;freeholder&#146;  (ibid., no. 5602), and again in 1591&#150;2 along with Hugh Maguire and others  (ibid., no. 5716). He subsequently moved to lands located at Currin (near Ballinamallard, barony of Tirkennedy, close to the border with Lurg barony), as can be learned from the composition &#145;T'aire riomsa, a r&iacute; &oacute; nUidhir&#146;  (Bergin, no. 33) addressed to Hugh Maguire in which the poet expresses dissatisfaction with the holding granted to him in virtue of his status as Maguire's <i>ollamh</i>. In 1610&#150;11 he was allotted a plantation grant of 210 acres at Clanawley barony (adjoining Magheraboy to the south), a fact suggesting an accommodation with the new order, which is borne out by a reference in his obituary to the esteem he enjoyed among the English.<br>
<br>Hugh's successor in the chieftainship, his half-brother C&uacute; Chonnacht &Oacute;g, also patronized &Oacute; hEodhasa who addresses him in several formal poems including &#145;Fada l&eacute;igthear Eamhain i n-aontomha&#146; (unpublished) which marks his inauguration, and the artistic eulogy &#145;Do f&eacute;achadh fulang Ghaoidheal&#146; (unpublished). &Oacute; hEodhasa's compositions to patrons other than the Maguires comprise approximately half of the surviving total of fifty attributed to him (half of which have been published) and fall into two more or less equal groups, namely those dating from the years before Hugh Maguire's death, and those composed thereafter. The former category includes addresses to such notables as Aodh Ruadh &Oacute; Domhnaill  (&#145;D&iacute;ol fuatha flaitheas &Eacute;ireann&#146;, O'Grady, 461) and Toirrdhealbhach Luineach &Oacute; N&eacute;ill  (&#145;An sluagh sidhe so i nEamhain&#146;, &Oacute; Donnchadha). Also eulogized by him in this period were members of the O'Doherty, Mac Sweeney, and O'Rourke families in Ulster, members of the Burke, MacDermot, and O Conor families in Connaught, and, in Leinster, various of the O'Byrnes, whose family &#145;duanaire&#146; contains five poems by &Oacute; hEodhasa (Mac Airt). Among noteworthy poems composed in the period after 1600 &#145;M&oacute;r theasda dh'obair &Oacute;ivid&#146;  (Breatnach, &#145;Metamorphosis&#146;) celebrates the accession of James I (1603), while, in striking contrast, &#145;Beag mhaireas do mhacraidh Gaoidheal&#146;  (ibid., 471&#150;2) addressed to Mac Mahon of Oriel, apparently after the flight of the earls in 1607, is marked by a deeply felt gloom concerning the Irish cause.<br>
<br>Eochaidh &Oacute; hEodhasa was an outstanding eulogist whose gift surpassed that of either of his two most illustrious contemporaries, Fearghal &Oacute;g Mac an Bhaird and Tadhg Dall &Oacute; hUiginn. His verse shows consistent compositional perfection, originality of expression and imagery (see for example the dazzlingly ornate address to Maguire's wounded hand, &#145;Sl&aacute;n f&aacute;d lot, a l&aacute;mh Aodha&#146;, unpublished), and a conscious versatility in the choice of apologues. Seriousness, grace, and intensity are characteristic qualities present in a number of personal poems such as his address to Hugh Maguire when absent on a campaign in Munster, &#145;Fuar leam an adhaighse d'Aodh&#146;  (Bergin, no. 29) and &#145;Fada &oacute;m intinn a hamharc&#146;  (&Oacute; Maolag&aacute;in), composed for a similarly absent C&uacute; Chonnacht Maguire. A keen awareness of his traditional rights and personal dignity shows in the poem &#145;M&oacute;r an t-ainm ollamh flatha&#146; as also in &#145;Beir oirbhire uaim go hAodh&#146; (unpublished) which reproves his patron for unwarranted public criticism of a poem. On the other hand good-natured self-deprecatory humour is evident in several informal compositions addressed to unspecified persons, as also in &#145;Ionmholta malairt bhisigh&#146;  (Bergin, no. 30), a poem in loose metre in which the merits of freer verse forms are extolled.<br>
<br>&Oacute; hEodhasa died on 9 June 1612, and the record of his death (in Walsh) describes him as &#145;a notable arch-professor in poetry and learning and in the clear intellect of Irish art, a good hosteller and keeper of a guest house generally, and a renowned man amongst the Irish and the English&#146;  (editor's translation).<br>
