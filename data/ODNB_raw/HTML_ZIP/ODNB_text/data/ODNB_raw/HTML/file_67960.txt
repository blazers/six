<span class="headword">Farrant,  Daniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">musician and musical instrument maker</span>, may have been related to other musicians named Farrant&#151;Richard (<i>d</i>. 1580) or any one of several Johns, all of whom were variously employed as church musicians. Both Richard and Daniel are known to have lived at Greenwich; on his death Richard left a widow, Ann, and nine children, perhaps including Daniel. The lack of a baptism record for Daniel may be due to the fact that the Greenwich registers before 1615 are lost. He was appointed to serve as a musician at court from Lady day 1607. Although listed among both violins and lutes, he is noted especially as a viol player.<br>
<br>Farrant seems to have been involved with the development of new stringed instruments, including some with sympathetic strings, but John Playford's claim that he &#145;invented&#146; them is not borne out by the evidence:<blockquote>Daniel Farrant &hellip; was a person of much ingenuity for his several rare inventions of instruments, as the <i>Polyphant</i> and the <i>Stump</i>, which were strung with wire [and a] &#145;<i>Lyra Viol</i>, to be strung with Lute Strings and Wire strings, the one above the other&#146;. (<span class="italic">Musick's Recreation on the Lyra Viol</span>, 1661)</blockquote>A warrant dated 27 February 1626 authorized &pound;109 to be paid to Farrant &#145;for 6 Artificiall Instruments which were made and finished for his Ma<sup>ts</sup> service&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E351/544). These must have been of special quality to command such a high value. Only three verified compositions by Farrant are known, but others are attributed to him: a pavan for lute, four pieces for solo lyra viol, and perhaps a fine five-part pavan on a repeating four-note figure.<br>
<br>On 28 February 1621 Farrant married Katherine Lanier, daughter of Nicholas Lanier (<i>d</i>. 1612) and his second wife, Lucretia, at St Botolph without Bishopsgate; she inherited land at Greenwich adjacent to their home. He was appointed one of the first assistants of the reconstituted Corporation of Musick in Westminster in 1635 and served at court until it was disbanded in 1642. By 1647 he had apparently become ill, and he was buried at St Alfege, Greenwich, on 24 July 1651. Farrant had made his will on 20 March 1643, bequeathing his whole estate to his wife, Katherine.<br>
