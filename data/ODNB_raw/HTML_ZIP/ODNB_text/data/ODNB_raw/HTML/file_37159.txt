<span class="headword">Barron,  William</span>  (1805&#150;1891), <span class="occ">landscape gardener</span>, was born on 7 September 1805 in Eccles, Berwickshire, the son of John Barron, gardener, and his wife, Betty Johnston. (The year of his birth is usually cited as 1800, as a result of a mistake in his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>.) He served a three-year gardening apprenticeship at Blackadder, Berwickshire, before entering the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, where he was soon placed in charge of the glasshouses. From there he went to Syon House, Middlesex, where he helped to plant the new conservatory. On 1 March 1830 he was appointed gardener to Charles Stanhope, fourth earl of Harrington, at Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire, where he took up his post on 2 August, with instructions to create a new garden.<br>
<br>Early in 1831 Barron began transplanting mature trees; he became expert in their removal and he described his techniques in <span class="italic">The British Winter Garden</span> (1852). The gardens he created were seldom visited before 1851, when a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> created a sensation by describing the transplanting operations, the grafted conifers, the avenues of multiple rows of different species, the architectural topiary, and the series of formal gardens enclosed by hedges. The revelation of Elvaston led to a topiary revival in the 1850s.<br>
<br>The fourth earl died in 1851 and his successor retrenched on expenditure, opened the gardens to the public, and instructed Barron to develop a commercial nursery at the garden. In 1862, on the death of Leicester Stanhope, fifth earl of Harrington, Barron bought 40 acres for a nursery site in nearby Borrowash, to which he moved from Elvaston in 1865. In addition to plant sales, Barron offered transplanting and landscape gardening. During Barron's life, among his firm's commissions were those undertaken at Stancliffe Hall, Matlock; Impney Hall, Droitwich; Locke Park, Barnsley; People's Park, Grimsby; and, his most famous work after Elvaston itself, Abbey Park, Leicester (between 1877 and 1882). In 1880 he successfully moved the Buckland yew, with a documented age of 800 years. One of his transplanting machines was preserved at Kew.<br>
<br>Barron retired in 1881 but came out of retirement for a commission for the ninth earl of Dysart, at Welbeck Abbey, in 1886. In 1887 he was the first witness called before the select commission on forestry. He was noted for his prodigious memory, he was deeply religious, and he was a staunch advocate of temperance.<br>
<br>Barron married Elizabeth Ashby, and their only child, John (born on 8 June 1844), having trained abroad in landscape gardening, became his father's partner by 1867. Barron died in Borrowash, Derbyshire, on 8 April 1891. The family continued the firm into the inter-war years. Among the firm's later commissions were those at Queen's Park, Chesterfield (1893); the Bedford Embankment (1894); and Whitaker Park, Rawtenstall (1900).<br>
