<span class="headword">Offor,  George</span>  (1787&#150;1864), <span class="occ">literary editor and book collector</span>, was born in the liberty of the Tower of London Without on 30 July 1787, the son of George Offor and his wife, Mary. He started in business as a bookseller at 2 Postern Row, Tower Hill, London, from which he retired with a competency. By the advice of his friend J. S. C. S. Frey, he learned Hebrew, and afterwards studied Greek and Latin. His knowledge of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literature, especially of theology, became very extensive, and he assembled a very large collection of early printed English <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, psalters, and testaments. In religion a Baptist, Offor was an enthusiastic admirer of John Bunyan, and gathered together a unique collection of Bunyan's scattered writings and of early editions of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>. An interest in William Tyndale took him to Brussels in search of details of his martyrdom. During the revolution of 1830, while near Vilvoord, Offor was taken prisoner by a detachment of Dutch troops and was briefly detained in the prison built on the ruins of the castle at Vilvoord where Tyndale had been confined. Offor, who was a justice of the peace, was married to Sarah Ann (1806/7&#150;1873) and had at least five daughters and three sons. He died at his home, Grove House, Grove Street, South Hackney, on 4 August 1864, and was buried in Abney Park cemetery.<br>
<br>Offor's biographical work on Bunyan, which drew on much new material he had found in the State Paper Office, was marred by a cumbrous style and bitter polemical spirit, and has long been superseded. His bibliography of Bunyan, prefixed to a three-volume collected edition of Bunyan's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1853), remained useful until replaced by F. M. Harrison's <span class="italic">Bibliography</span> (1932). Offor's 1853 edition continued for even longer&#151;with all its faults&#151;to be the sole collection of Bunyan's writings. It was from 1976 replaced by the Oxford edition, whose general editor, Roger Sharrock, justly commented on Offor's work as containing &#145;an amount of painstaking if amateur bibliographical information, and a verbose and often melodramatic evangelical commentary&#146;. His other Bunyan publications included a careful reprint (1848) of the first edition of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> with notes of all subsequent authorial adjustments.<br>
<br>Offor's library, with nearly 4000 literary items and including more than 500 Bunyan rarities, was destined for sale at Sothebys over eleven days from 27 June 1865 onwards, but much was lost in a fire at the auction rooms on 29 June. About a thousand volumes salvaged from the blaze were sold by Puttick and Simpson the following year. Many of the surviving Bunyan items came into the possession of Sir Leicester Harmsworth (sale, Sothebys, February 1947); the Offor family's portion of the remainder was presented in 1964 by his grandson Richard (1882&#150;1964), sometime librarian of the University of Leeds, to the Elstow Moot Hall, in the village of Bunyan's birth, and is now in the charge of the Bedford Central Library.<br>
<br>Offor compiled an introductory Hebrew reader (1812) and produced a revised edition of the Hebrew psalter (1820). A reprint of Tyndale's 1526 <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, with an introductory memoir (1836), was more substantial. He edited several other protestant reprints and projected a reprint of Coverdale's <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His collections towards a history of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span> between 1525 and 1679 are in the British Library  (Add. MSS 26670&#150;26674). The British Library also holds many printed volumes bearing Offor's copious annotations.<br>
