<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coningsby, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1550&#150;1625), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was born on 9 October 1550, the second son of Humphrey Coningsby (1516&#150;1559) of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, and Anne Englefield. His father's death was quickly followed in 1561 by that of his elder brother, Edward, leaving Thomas heir to substantial estates in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Through his mother he was connected to the Englefield family of Berkshire, whose landed wealth and tradition of royal service (especially in the law) mirrored that of the Coningsby family. Nothing is known of Thomas's childhood or education, although he may have followed his late brother into wardship under Sir Edward Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1568), comptroller of the household to Elizabeth I.<br>
<br>Coningsby was probably already associated with the earl of Leicester by the time he began to cut a figure at court in 1571: he and his sister and brother-in-law were linked in a property transaction with John Hubaud, a Herefordshire neighbour and one of Leicester's most important servants, in 1564. Coningsby was granted a licence to travel abroad for three years in 1572 and subsequently accompanied Leicester's nephew, Philip Sidney, in Vienna and northern Italy in 1573&#150;4. He married Sidney's first cousin, Philippa Fitzwilliam (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1617), probably after his return to England. By 1577 Coningsby was resident in Herefordshire and anxious to establish his influence over county affairs. In that year he provoked a dispute with the agents of Robert, earl of Essex, then still a minor. He soon became a deputy lieutenant and began to clash with the leading figure in the county, Sir James Croft, comptroller to the queen. The rivalry between Croft's supporters and those of Coningsby became increasingly bitter and violent during the 1580s, resulting in affrays, threats, lawsuits, and sharp competition for local offices. Coningsby received high-level support in his challenge to Croft from Leicester, who had turned against the comptroller in the 1570s.<br>
<br>After Leicester's death in 1588, Coningsby found a new patron in the earl of Essex, Leicester's stepson. Essex's support may explain how Coningsby became a gentleman pensioner extraordinary in 1589. Croft's death in 1590 allowed Coningsby to engineer Essex's election as steward of Hereford and Leominster, where Essex employed him as his deputy. Essex's political clout stifled local opposition to Coningsby and his friends for a decade. In 1591 Coningsby joined Essex's expedition to Normandy, serving as commissary of musters. During this campaign he kept a daily journal of events between 13&#150;14 August and 24 December. At least two incomplete copies of this journal survive. On 8 October 1591 Coningsby was one of twenty-four new knights made by Essex &#145;upon a fair green in the sight of&#146; Rouen  (Coningsby, 27). He was paid as muster-master until 15 March 1592. Either upon his return or shortly before he left for France, he became a gentleman pensioner in ordinary. On 27 September 1592, as part of the celebrations for Elizabeth's visit to the university, Coningsby was created master of arts at Oxford, along with many other friends of Essex.<br>
<br>In 1593 and 1597 Coningsby was elected to parliament as senior knight of the shire for Herefordshire, an honour previously monopolized by Croft. However, the grip on the county of Coningsby and his friends was never complete and was exposed to challenge by Essex's fall in February 1601. Although he managed to succeed Essex as steward of Leominster, Coningsby failed to find a powerful new patron at court. Despite going to extraordinary and illegal lengths, he and his allies could not prevent Sir John Scudamore from becoming steward of Hereford. Coningsby himself barely retained his status as senior knight in a bruising parliamentary election later in 1601. With the accession of James I he resigned as a gentleman pensioner and turned to his relative Sir Robert Sidney, whose office as chamberlain to Queen Anne allowed him to force an unwilling Sir Herbert Croft to share the office of receiver for the queen's lands in Herefordshire with Coningsby in 1604. Although he was appointed to the council in the marches of Wales in 1617 (fully thirty-five years after Philip Sidney first raised the prospect) and doggedly asserted his rights at Leominster, Coningsby largely conceded dominance in county affairs to the Croft&#150;Scudamore interest during the Jacobean period.<br>
<br>Coningsby's health was often poor and his thoughts apparently turned to ensuring the survival of his family line. Only one of his many sons, Fitzwilliam, born in the late 1590s, survived to adulthood. Three daughters married into allied Herefordshire families, a fourth remained unmarried at her father's death and a fifth, Sidney, was &#145;defective&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1614 Sir Thomas established Coningsby's Hospital for old soldiers and serving-men on the remains of the old Blackfriars in Hereford. The leader of these servitors was &#145;to be called Corporal Coningsby, and by no other surname&#146;  (Price, 219&#150;20). Sir Thomas's Calvinist faith is illustrated by his regulations for the hospital of July 1617, which stipulated that the chaplain must be a preacher, and that the company of inmates must march to the cathedral in file behind the chaplain carrying the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Coningsby wrote his extraordinary and bombastic will in 1616, revising it several times before his death at his home at Hampton Court, Herefordshire, on 30 May 1625. The will and first codicil of September 1617 emphasize his utter rejection of vain ceremonies and his confidence in his own resurrection. He was buried next to his wife at Hope church, Herefordshire.<br>
