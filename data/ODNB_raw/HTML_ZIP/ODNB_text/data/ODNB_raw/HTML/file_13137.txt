<span class="headword">Hetherington,  William Maxwell</span>  (1803&#150;1865), <span class="occ">poet and minister of the Free Church of Scotland</span>, was born on 4 June 1803 in the parish of Troqueer, near Dumfries, the son of Robert Hetherington, gardener, and his wife, Anne Maxwell. Having received a parish-school education, he was trained as a gardener, but entered the University of Edinburgh in 1822, and became a distinguished student. Before completing his studies for the church he published <span class="italic">Twelve Dramatic Sketches Founded on the Pastoral Poetry of Scotland</span> (1829). These eulogies of Scottish peasantry were all inspired by or imitated traditional popular lyrics.<br>
<br>Hetherington became minister of Torphichen, Linlithgow, in 1836; and on 29 May 1836 he married Jessie, daughter of the Revd Dr Meek, of Hamilton. His <span class="italic">History of the Church of Scotland from the Introduction of Christianity to the Period of the Disruption, May 18, 1843</span>, was published in 1843. It was preceded by an essay &#145;On the principles and constitution of the Church of Scotland&#146;, and was reprinted several times. Its avowed purpose was to defend the newly created Free Church, of which he was one of the founder members. In 1844 he was appointed to a charge in St Andrews; there he established the <span class="italic">Free Church Magazine</span> which he edited for four years. He also contributed to religious periodicals, especially the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Evangelical Review</span>, and published sermons, poems, and some small religious and historical works. He became minister of Free St Paul's, Edinburgh, in 1848; and was appointed professor of theology at New College, Glasgow, in 1857. He was made LLD by the College of New Brunswick, Canada, and DD by Jefferson College, Pennsylvania. He died at 13 Oakfield Terrace, Hillhead, Glasgow, on 23 May 1865, survived by his wife, and was buried in the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
