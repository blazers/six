<span class="headword">Horner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Graham]</span>,  Frances Jane</span>, Lady Horner  (1854/5&#150;1940), <span class="occ">hostess and patron of the arts</span>, the fourth daughter and sixth of the eight children of William Graham (1818&#150;1885), MP, India merchant, and art patron, and Jane Catherine, daughter of John Lowndes of Renfrewshire, was educated by governesses in her evangelical, Presbyterian family home at Langley Hall, near Manchester, and then at 54 Lowndes Square, London. Excluded from fashionable life by her father's connections with trade, Frances Graham initially owed her position in society to friendship with the Tennant sisters (whose father was also in business and also a Liberal MP for Glasgow), to friendship with the Gladstone&#150;Lyttelton circle, and, most importantly, to her connections with the artist Edward Burne-Jones.<br>
<br>William Graham, a patron of modern British painting, introduced his daughter at an early age to the studios of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, including Rossetti and Burne-Jones through whom she also became acquainted with John Ruskin. Burne-Jones developed a passion for Frances Graham, designed &#145;Sirens for her girdle, Heavens and Paradises for her prayer-books&#146;  (Burne-Jones, 2.130&#150;31), wrote to her constantly, and included her likeness in a number of his pictures, including <span class="italic">The Golden Staircase</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Downs</span> (1883). Occasioning despair in the married Burne-Jones (who commented, &#145;she has gone and married a market gardener&#146;; ibid.), she married into an unexceptionable English county family in the person of John Francis Fortescue Horner (1842&#150;1927), barrister, of Mells Park, Frome, Somerset, on 18 January 1883; her husband was knighted in 1907. Of their four children, the eldest son, Edward, was killed in 1917, and the younger, Mark, died at sixteen in 1908. Their younger daughter, Katharine, married Raymond Asquith, son of Herbert Henry Asquith; he also was killed in the war.<br>
<br>At Mells, Frances Horner continued to play host to the artistic and intellectual friends who had surrounded her in London, where she had been one of the first young unmarried women to entertain her own guests. Both she and her husband were part of the informal aristocratic group, the Souls, who shared her artistic interests and dislike of the &#145;sporting set&#146;. Edwin Lutyens described her as &#145;a political intriguer&#146;, but commented that &#145;her bias [was] born of friends and not conviction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edwin Lutyens</span>, 218&#150;19). For H. H. Asquith she acted as confidante, and throughout the 1890s he corresponded with her regularly. R. B. Haldane, whom she had introduced to upper-class society, attributed his acceptance of the War Office in 1905 to her decisive influence.<br>
<br>A needlewoman of considerable skill&#151;one of her embroideries, executed to a design by Burne-Jones, hangs in St Andrew's Church, Mells&#151;Frances Horner contributed mainly to the arts as a patron. She was principally responsible for several significant memorial commissions in the village and church at Mells, by Burne-Jones, Alfred Munnings, Eric Gill, William Nicholson, and, most importantly, Edwin Lutyens. The latter's design for the memorial to Edward Horner, an equestrian statue by Munnings atop a Lutyens plinth, has been described as &#145;one of Lutyens's best and most moving tributes to the waste of life in the Great War&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edwin Lutyens</span>, 371&#150;2).<br>
<br>Widowed in 1927, Lady Horner lived on at the Manor House, Mells, with her daughter, Katharine Asquith, until 1940, when she died on 1 March at the age of eighty-five. She had been appointed OBE in 1919, and for a time was a JP. In 1933 she published a volume of memoirs under the title <span class="italic">Time Remembered</span>.<br>
