<span class="headword">Welles,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1660), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in Whichford, Warwickshire, the second of the three children of Robert Welles (1540&#150;1617), yeoman, and his wife, Alice. Several nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sketches of Welles's life provide conflicting details of his English origins, but recent work shows that these earlier biographers had confused him with two other men named Thomas Welles, one of whom lived in Northamptonshire and did not migrate to New England, while the other was of unknown English background and arrived in Massachusetts in 1636, the same year as Thomas Welles of Whichford. As far as can be determined, the family of Welles had lived in Warwickshire for four generations and owned a substantial amount of property there but were not members of the gentry. Welles's parents had sufficient funds to educate him in Latin, however, and his reception in New England suggests that he had the bearing of a gentleman.<br>
<br>Several accounts of Welles's life state that he emigrated to New England as secretary to William Fiennes, first Viscount Saye and Sele, and settled briefly at a fort named Saybrook, the nucleus of a settlement Saye and Sele was trying to create under the terms of a royal land grant called the Warwick patent. Both Welles's official relationship with Saye and Sele and his residence at Saybrook appear fanciful, an invention intended to elevate his status. Members of the Welles and Fiennes families certainly knew each other in Warwickshire, but no evidence exists to link them in the New World. Inasmuch as Welles arrived in New England with his wife, Alice Tomes (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1640), whom he married about 1615, and six children, Fort Saybrook, with its all-male garrison, seems unlikely to have been his early residence.<br>
<br>Instead, when Welles arrived in June 1636, he probably disembarked in Boston. Before the year was over he and his family had moved twice, first to Newtown (later Cambridge) and then to Hartford as part of an overland expedition led by Thomas Hooker into the Connecticut river valley. Chosen a magistrate in Connecticut in 1637, Welles was one of the seven magistrates who in 1639 drafted and signed the famous fundamental orders of Connecticut, often called the first English constitution written in the New World. Under it he served as treasurer of Connecticut (1639&#150;51), secretary (1640&#150;48), deputy governor (1654&#150;5, 1656&#150;8), and governor (1655&#150;6, 1658&#150;9). His terms as governor were not consecutive because the fundamental orders specified that no one could serve two years in a row. He also frequently served as Connecticut's delegate to the meetings of the United Colonies of New England, a loose confederation of puritan settlements that was created to maintain a common defence against military threats. His greatest talents seemed to lie in his ability as a diplomat to inspire trust in people and to bring disputants together in compromise. He represented Connecticut in thorny negotiations with all of its neighbours, Massachusetts, the Dutch in New Netherland, and the Mohican Indians in the Narragansett country of south-east New England. In each case Welles exercised a restraining hand and quelled apprehended disturbances.<br>
<br>One of Connecticut's wealthiest residents, Welles acquired much of his estate from his second marriage in 1646, to Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Deming) Foote (<i>c</i>.1595&#150;1683), the widow of Nathaniel Foote (1593&#150;1644) from the neighbouring town of Wethersfield, Connecticut. Welles moved to his wife's Wethersfield home shortly after their marriage and died there unexpectedly in his sleep on 14 January 1660. Buried in the First Society cemetery in Wethersfield, Welles also has his name inscribed on the founders' monument in the ancient burial-ground in Hartford.<br>
