<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  John</span>, Lord Craighall  (1603<span class="mult">x</span>5&#150;1654), <span class="occ">advocate</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13736/', "Sir Thomas Hope")</script> of Craighall, Fife (1573&#150;1646), lord advocate, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of John Bennet of Wallyford, near Haddington; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13735/', "Sir Thomas Hope (1606&#150;1643)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13722/', "Sir James Hope (1614&#150;1661)")</script> were his younger brothers. He was educated for the law, and rapidly acquired a thriving practice. In 1632 Hope was knighted and appointed an ordinary lord of session, assuming the title of Lord Craighall, and taking his seat on 27 July. He married Margaret, daughter of Sir Archibald Murray of Blackbarony, in the same year. The couple had two sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In common with his father, Craighall was sympathetic to the aims of the national covenant. He was a close associate of Archibald Johnston of Wariston (a leader of the covenanting movement, and lord advocate in 1646), who attended the baptism of his daughter Helen in June 1638. In September, Craighall refused to subscribe Charles I's alternative king's covenant, unless the general assembly approved the document. In 1640 he was a member of the committee of estates charged with the defence of the kingdom against Charles, and in 1641 was reappointed ordinary lord of session. Craighall was one of the commissioners for the visitation of St Andrews in 1644 (at which date he succeeded his brother Sir Thomas Hope of Kerse as a commissioner for the plantation of kirks), and was appointed to the privy council in 1645.<br>
<br>Latterly, Craighall joined the Cromwellian administration of Scotland, and was reputedly of the opinion that Charles II ought &#145;to treat with Cromwell for the one halff of his cloake before he lost the whole&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Scot. nat.</span>, 2.490). In May 1652 he was one of eight commissioners appointed by the new regime to manage Scottish affairs. The appointment caused a rift with his former colleague Johnston of Wariston, who wrote that Craighall gained little &#145;comfort&#146; from his employment, &#145;which he took to provyde his children, [but] in al apearance hes lost mor be the superiorities [than] gotten be his fees&#146;. Indeed, he noted, the family &#145;looked very ruynous&#146; by 1654. Nevertheless, on hearing of Craighall's &#145;fayling and wearying away&#146; of a violent &#145;seaknesse&#146; Wariston joined a &#145;great multitude about [his old friend's] bed&#146; in Edinburgh  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Archibald Johnston</span>, ed. Fleming, 167, 240&#150;43). Craighall died, at &#145;about midnight&#146;, on 28 April 1654, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Their second son, <a name="cosubject_13715"></a><span class="headword">Archibald Hope</span>, Lord Rankeillor  (1639&#150;1706)<span class="occ"></span>, was lord of session in 1689 and lord of justiciary in 1690. Adopting the title of Lord Rankeillor, he was appointed to the privy council in 1696, and was a commissioner to parliament in 1706. With his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aytoun, he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53150/', "Sir Thomas Hope, eighth baronet")</script>. He died on 10 October 1706.<br>
