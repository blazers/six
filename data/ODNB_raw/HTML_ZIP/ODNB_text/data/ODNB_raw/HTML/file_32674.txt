<span class="headword">Currie,  Philip Henry Wodehouse</span>, Baron Currie  (1834&#150;1906), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born in London on 13 October 1834, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48015/', "Raikes Currie (1801&#150;1881)")</script> of Bush Hill, Middlesex, and Minley Manor, Hampshire, MP for Northampton (1837&#150;57), and his wife, Laura Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1869), eldest daughter of John Wodehouse, second Baron Wodehouse. He was educated at Eton College and entered the Foreign Office at the age of twenty. He served in that department for forty years, moving up the various grades of political staff to become assistant under-secretary of state for foreign affairs in 1882 and permanent under-secretary of state, the highest permanent post in the Foreign Office, in 1888. He was pr&eacute;cis writer to the earl of Clarendon during the latter's tenure as foreign secretary and was temporarily attached to the British legation at St Petersburg in 1856 and 1857, during Lord Wodehouse's special mission to the Russian capital on the conclusion of the Crimean War. He assisted Julian Fane in his duties as protocolist to the conferences on the affairs of Luxembourg in May 1867.<br>
<br>When Lord Salisbury was sent to Constantinople in 1876 to act as British plenipotentiary to the conference on the Eastern question, Currie was appointed secretary to his special mission. Salisbury formed a high opinion of Currie's abilities; it was to be the beginning of a friendship and close professional relationship between the two men. On Salisbury's accession to the foreign secretaryship in April 1878, Currie became his private secretary and when Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury attended the congress of Berlin the following June, Currie and Montague Corry (later Lord Rowton) accompanied them as joint secretaries to the special mission. Currie received the CB in recognition of his services. On his return to Britain in addition to his work as private secretary, Currie was entrusted by Salisbury with the correspondence respecting Cyprus, which had been leased from the sultan under the convention of 4 June 1878.<br>
<br>When Earl Granville succeeded Salisbury as foreign secretary, Currie resumed his work in the Foreign Office as senior clerk in charge of the Eastern department. He was attached as secretary to the special mission sent to invest King Alfonso XII of Spain with the Garter in 1881 and was appointed assistant under-secretary in October 1882. From June to August 1884 Currie acted as joint protocolist to the conferences held in London on the finances of Egypt. In 1885 he was created KCB and in December 1888 was promoted permanent under-secretary of state in succession to Lord Pauncefote, who became British ambassador at Washington.<br>
<br>Currie again worked very closely with Salisbury when the latter returned to the foreign secretaryship between 1885 and 1886 and again from 1887 until 1892. The permanent under-secretary not only had the full confidence of his chief but seemed to understand what was in Salisbury's mind without being given explicit instructions. In 1885, for instance, Currie, who had been taking the waters at the fashionable spa at Bad Homburg, secured an invitation to spend three days alone with Bismarck, the German chancellor, at Friedrichsr&uuml;he, during which they discussed a whole range of questions. Without written instructions from Salisbury, Currie was able to express the foreign secretary's views and to put out feelers which he knew Salisbury was anxious to follow up.<br>
<br>In fact it was often Currie, as permanent under-secretary, who expanded on official instructions to ambassadors and ministers through private letters sent regularly to posts abroad. Salisbury disliked giving precise orders; he would sketch out his position and then let Currie fill in what was left unsaid. He sometimes even left to Currie the task of receiving ambassadors before they went out to their missions in order to explain what general lines the foreign secretary intended them to follow. Salisbury refused to see either Sir Robert Morier or Sir Nicolas O'Conor, for example, when they left in 1885 and 1886 for their respective posts in St Petersburg and Constantinople; nevertheless, his short note to Currie explaining that he did not wish to see O'Conor or to give him any instructions provided the permanent under-secretary with all the guidance he needed for his conversation with the ambassador.<br>
<br>Currie served for five years as permanent under-secretary, during which he was made GCB in 1892. He was then appointed by Lord Rosebery in December 1893 as British ambassador at Constantinople and, following precedent, was sworn of the privy council. He held this embassy for four and a half very difficult years when relations between Britain and Turkey were exceedingly tense. During 1895 and 1896, in response to the repeated Turkish massacres of the Armenians, representatives of the great powers intervened to demand reforms and the investigation and punishment of the perpetrators. Lord Kimberley in 1895 and then Lord Salisbury (1895&#150;1901) took the lead in trying to secure the co-operation of the other powers, especially Russia, to bring pressure on the sultan to rein in the Muslim fanatics and to grant concessions. These efforts met with little success, in part because the tsar refused to sanction any coercive measures against the sultan. There was a moment, in August 1896, after a bloody massacre of Armenians in Constantinople by Muslim mobs armed by the Turkish authorities, when it appeared that Britain might intervene despite the risks involved. These were eventually judged to be too high and the idea was dropped, but Currie was instructed to press the sultan to keep Muslim fanaticism in check. A further incident embittered relations between Britain and the sultan when Sa&#145;id Pasha, a former grand vizier imprisoned when he refused to resume his office at the sultan's command, escaped and took refuge in the British embassy. It took five days of negotiations before the sultan promised Currie that the recalcitrant ex-minister would not be molested in any way. The sultan made no secret of his wish to have Currie replaced, but Salisbury turned a deaf ear to these intimations.<br>
<br>In 1897 the troubles of Asia Minor were succeeded by the revolt of Crete, which was followed by Greek army support for the Cretans, the outbreak of war between Greece and Turkey, and the disastrous defeat of the Greek army. The great powers acting in concert intervened to secure favourable terms for Greece and the autonomy of Crete under Turkish suzerainty, but the physical strain on Currie during this period was considerable and his health gave way. The situation in Constantinople would have taxed any British representative, but Currie lacked the patience, infinite tact, and indirectness of approach needed in the Ottoman capital. He was therefore more than happy to succeed Sir Clare Ford at the embassy at Rome in July 1898, his last post before he was retired on pension on 17 January 1903.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, what should have been a peaceful sojourn was marked by tension. This arose from the feeling in Rome that Italian interests with regard to Tripoli had been ignored during the course of Britain's negotiations with France, which led to the Anglo-French agreement of March 1899 concerning the Sudan and Nile basin. The British Foreign Office was in fact not sympathetically inclined towards supporting Italian interests in Africa, which were the main subjects of discussion during Currie's time in Rome. Neither in Constantinople nor in Rome therefore did the ambassador enjoy the kind of success that his great ability and social advantages merited. Indeed Currie's efficiency, clarity of judgement, and familiarity with the details of foreign policy were more appropriate to service in the Foreign Office in London than to the conduct of diplomacy abroad.<br>
<br>Currie, who belonged to a well-known banking family, was a man of considerable wealth and he entertained as befitted a &#145;grand seigneur&#146;. He was more at ease among a small circle of friends and acquaintances who shared his refined tastes and enjoyed his incisive powers of conversation and good-natured irony than in the wider diplomatic circle in which he had to move. On 24 January 1894 he married Mrs Mary Montgomerie Singleton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lamb (1843&#150;1905), a well-known author and poet under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Violet Fane [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32673/', "Currie, Mary Montgomerie")</script>]. There were no children. Currie was raised to the peerage in 1899 as Baron Currie of Hawley. He died on 12 May 1906 at Hawley, Hampshire, and was buried three days later at St Andrew's Church, Minley, near Fleet, Hampshire.<br>
