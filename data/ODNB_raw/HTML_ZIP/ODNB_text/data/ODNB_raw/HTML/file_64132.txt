<span class="headword">Sargent,  John</span>  (1750&#150;1831), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the younger of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49963/', "John Sargent (1714&#150;1791)")</script>, draper and MP, of May Place, Kent, and his wife, Rosamund Chambers (1722&#150;1792). He was educated at Eton College (1760&#150;67), where he contributed to the <span class="italic">Musae Etonienses</span>, and then entered St John's College, Cambridge (1767), and Lincoln's Inn (1770). Introduced to his future wife by his friend the poet William Hayley, on 21 December 1778 he married Charlotte (1754&#150;1841), the daughter of Richard Bettsworth of Petworth and his wife, Charlotte Orme. Through her mother she inherited Woollavington in Sussex, which was rebuilt as their marital abode; they had six sons and four daughters. Sargent, like his father, was a director of the Bank of England (1778&#150;9), and he was also appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber. In 1785 he published a poem, <span class="italic">The Mine</span>, celebrating fossil life in quicksilver mines; to the third edition of 1796 he appended poems on Stonehenge and Mary Queen of Scots.<br>
<br>Sargent's neighbour in Sussex, the duke of Richmond, secured his return to parliament for Seaford in 1790, despite a disputed election. Sargent supported Pitt's administration, first speaking in favour of the bank's appropriation of unclaimed dividends on 15 December 1790. In 1791 he joined the public revenue committee, and from 1792 he was a ministerial division teller. He became clerk of the ordnance under the duke of Richmond in November 1793 and exchanged Seaford for Queenborough on the ordnance interest on 15 February 1794. He mostly spoke on departmental matters in the house but occasionally addressed other matters. For example, he introduced a <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Bill</span> on 12 November 1795 and chaired the committee on the <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings Bill</span> on 27 November. Pitt then recommended him warmly, but in vain, to Lord Camden as his chief secretary at Dublin. He secured tax exemption for physicians on 22 December 1797 and chaired the income tax committee in March 1799. Retaining office under Addington, Sargent became junior secretary to the Treasury on 8 July 1802, but he was defeated in the general election. He came in for Bodmin on Lord De Dunstanville's interest on 17 December 1802, but ceased debating to concentrate on managing government bills through the house. In 1803 he joined the board of agriculture. Despite Pittite overtures, he went into opposition in May 1804 with Addington, who procured an annual pension for his wife of &pound;616 to reward his public services. He supported Addington when he joined forces again with Pitt in 1805 and, like him, seceded from Pitt's government that summer. His support for Grenville's administration of 1806 won him a commissionership of public accounts, on condition that he resign his seat. Sargent held office until 1821, and served as chairman of quarter sessions in Sussex for more than forty years. He died on 9 September 1831 and was buried in Lavington, Sussex.<br>
