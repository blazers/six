<span class="headword">Baird,  George Husband</span>  (1761&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university principal</span>, was a native of the parish of Bo'ness on the Forth, Linlithgowshire, where his father, a landed gentleman of Stirlingshire, rented a farm from the duke of Hamilton. Born on 13 July 1761 at Inveravon, Bo'ness, Baird received his primary education at the parish school of Bo'ness, and, on the family's removal to a newly purchased property, named Manuel, in Linlithgowshire, at the parish school of Linlithgow. He was a plodding, persevering, and well-mannered, rather than a brilliant, schoolboy. In 1773, in his thirteenth year, he was entered as a student in humanity (Latin) and Greek at Edinburgh University. He speedily came under the favourable notice of Principal Robertson, the historian, and Professor Dalzel, and others, because of his devotion to his class-work and marked progress. Not content with the tasks of the university classes, he carried on simultaneously philological and philosophical researches, in which he was associated with James Finlayson, afterwards professor of logic at Edinburgh, and Josiah Walker, afterwards professor of humanity at Glasgow. As a result of these extra-collegiate studies he acquired an exceptionally varied and accurate knowledge of nearly all the living languages of Europe.<br>
<br>In 1784 Baird was recommended by Professor Dalzel as tutor in the family of Colonel Blair, of Blair. In 1786 he received licence as a preacher of the gospel from the presbytery of Linlithgow of the Church of Scotland. In 1787 he was presented to the parish of Dunkeld by the duke of Atholl, through influence brought to bear by his friend Finlayson. Before leaving for his parish he had encountered Robert Burns, and in his old age he delighted to tell of his having repeatedly met with the &#145;Ayrshire ploughman&#146;; his name was among the subscribers to the poet's first volume, published at Kilmarnock in 1786. Baird was evangelical rather than with the Church of Scotland's &#145;moderates&#146;, but family ties threw him a good deal into the cultivated circle of the Robertsons and Blairs and their school. While he was parish clergyman at Dunkeld he was resident in the duke's family, and superintended the education of the duke's three sons. In 1789&#150;90 he was presented to the large and important parish church of Edinburgh, known as &#145;Lady Yester's&#146;, but the ducal house of Atholl persuaded him to decline the call.<br>
<br>His marriage in August 1792 to Isabella, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8611/', "Thomas Elder")</script>, lord provost of Edinburgh, was a fortunate one. In November 1792 the town council presented him to New Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh, and also to the chair of Hebrew at Edinburgh University, which was in their gift. The senatus academicus conferred on him the honorary degree of DD in the same year. In 1793, though comparatively youthful and untried, he was elected by the town council principal of Edinburgh University, in succession to William Robertson. As principal he was called upon to punish a breach of the university's discipline committed by three students who subsequently attained to pre-eminent distinction. A challenge had been addressed to one of the professors, and the parties implicated in the misdemeanour were Lord Henry Petty (afterwards marquess of Lansdowne), Henry Brougham, and Francis Horner. These students were summoned before the senatus academicus. Only Brougham appeared, and the rebuke of the principal was so delivered and accepted that a warm friendship ensued, and lasted long after Brougham had entered public life.<br>
<br>In 1799 Principal Baird was translated to the New North Church. In 1801, on the death of Dr Blair, he was appointed his successor in the High Church, where he remained until his death. Towards the close of his life he vigorously promoted a scheme for the education of the poor in the highlands and islands of Scotland. He submitted his proposal to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in May 1824, and it was sanctioned in the following year. In his sixty-seventh year, when enfeebled in health, he traversed the entire highlands of Argyll, the west of Inverness and Ross, and the western islands, from Lewis to Kintyre. In his sixty-eighth year he similarly visited the north highlands, and the Orkneys and Shetland. Through his influence Dr Andrew Bell, of Madras, bequeathed &pound;5000 for education in the highlands of Scotland. Baird died on 14 January 1840 at Manuel.<br>
