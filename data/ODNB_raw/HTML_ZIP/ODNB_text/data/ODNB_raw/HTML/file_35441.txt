<span class="headword">Pearson, Sir  (Cyril) Arthur</span>, first baronet  (1866&#150;1921), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and philanthropist</span>, was born on 24 February 1866 at Wookey near Wells, the eldest child and only son among the four children of the Revd Arthur Cyril Pearson (1838&#150;1916) and his wife, Philippa Massingberd Maxwell Lyte (1846&#150;1909). His great-grandfather was the hymnologist the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17302/', "Revd Henry Francis Lyte")</script>. He was educated from the age of ten at Eagle House School, Wimbledon, going on after four years there to Winchester College. Straitened family circumstances forced his departure at the age of sixteen, and he returned home to be taught by his father. In 1884 he won a general knowledge quiz in Sir George Newnes's journal <span class="italic">Tit-Bits</span>; the prize was a clerkship at the <span class="italic">Tit-Bits</span> London office at a salary of &pound;100 a year. By the following year he had pushed himself into the position of manager.<br>
<br>When in 1890 Newnes and W. T. Stead devised the monthly digest <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span> Pearson was made business manager, but finding his position now constrictive and unremunerative Pearson broke away in July 1890 to found his own journal. As the first number of <span class="italic">Pearson's Weekly</span> proclaimed on 26 July, it was intended &#145;to interest, to elevate, to amuse&#146;, and its amalgam of light instruction and entertainment ultimately proved extraordinarily attractive to an aspiring late Victorian middle- and respectable working-class readership. <span class="italic">Pearson's Weekly</span> struggled initially, however, until Pearson hit upon the key to his fortune, the &#145;Missing Word&#146; competition. First announced in December 1891, its rapid popularity made him a rich man. Sales reached a peak of one and a quarter million in 1897, and <span class="italic">Pearson's Weekly</span> established a significant share of the popular magazine market. Wealth fuelled Pearson's philanthropy, and in 1892 he established the Fresh Air Fund in Britain, a means of sending children from city slums on annual trips to the countryside. Pearson also provided the initial funding for Robert Baden-Powell's Boy Scout movement.<br>
<br>Pearson subsequently founded the <span class="italic">Royal Magazine</span> and other titles and was able to go into semi-retirement in 1897. This soon palled with the energetic Pearson, and in 1899 he was teamed with Newnes once more on the board of the British Mutoscope and Biograph Company, the premier British film company of the period, with the bold but ultimately mistaken aim of providing illustrated journalism through motion picture devices for the home. He then turned to the launch of a daily newspaper. 24 April 1900 saw the first edition of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, price halfpence, eight broadsheet pages with news innovatively featured on the outside. Pearson's main political passion at this time was tariff reform, and in 1903 he and Joseph Chamberlain formed the Tariff Reform League. During the period 1903&#150;5 Pearson directed the operations of the Tariff Reform League as executive chairman and also served as vice-chairman of the tariff commission. His involvement undoubtedly led to his neglect of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>.<br>
<br>In 1905 Pearson acquired <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, and made a failed bid for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1907&#150;8, but he began to lose interest in his newspapers just as he lost interest in tariff reform after the general election of 1905. Partly this was Pearson's nature, always dropping an enthusiasm once the challenge was over, but the onset of blindness was no doubt the determining factor. He sold <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, along with the mildly profitable <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, in 1910, having despaired of &#145;a publication which showed no signs of becoming a genuine financial proposition&#146;  (Porter, 576).<br>
<br>Characteristically, Pearson did not dwell on his loss of sight, but set out to discover what was most positive about it. Having disposed of his newspaper holdings by 1912, he became president of the National Institute for the Blind. At the outbreak of war Pearson found fresh outlet for his energies by establishing a hostel for blinded soldiers, first in Bayswater in February 1915, but moving the following month to spacious accommodation at St Dunstan's in Regent's Park. Initially treating sixteen soldiers, by the end of the war St Dunstan's and other hostels had cared for over 1500. More than just treating blindness Pearson oversaw a whole policy of re-education and readjustment into society, doing remarkable work in the process to change public perception of blind people.<br>
<br>In recognition of these public services Pearson was created a baronet in 1916 and GBE in 1917. He was twice married: first, on 3 December 1887, to Isobel Sarah, daughter of the Revd F. Bennett, with whom he had three daughters; second, on 3 June 1897, to Ethel Maud (<i>d</i>. 1959), daughter of W. J. Fraser, with whom he had one son. Pearson died on 9 December 1921 at his London home, 15 Devonshire Street: he drowned after hitting his head on a bath tap. He was buried on 13 December in Hampstead cemetery. His only son, Neville Arthur Pearson, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
<br>Possessing an extraordinary enthusiasm for life, Sir Arthur Pearson revolutionized people's attitude towards blind people. His energy was intimidating to some, and Joseph Chamberlain paid him a double-edged compliment in calling him &#145;the greatest hustler I have ever known&#146;  (Dark, 104); but a man whose opinions were mostly caprice and whose thoughts were shallow could never be a great newspaperman. He was popularly mourned as the &#145;Blind leader of the blind&#146;.<br>
