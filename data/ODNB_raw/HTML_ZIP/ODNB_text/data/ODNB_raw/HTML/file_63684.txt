<span class="headword">Batten,  William</span>  (1889&#150;1959), <span class="occ">rugby player</span>, was born on 26 May 1889 at 9 Gorton Terrace, Kinsley, Hemsworth, Yorkshire, the son of James Batten (1848&#150;1910), a coalminer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hughes. He played rugby as a junior with Kinsley and Ackworth United before joining Hunslet in the Northern Union. His signing-on fee was a new suit. He made his d&eacute;but on 9 February 1907 in a 15&#150;0 win against Barrow. In his second season, aged only eighteen, he helped Hunslet to become the first team to win all four cups. In the 1911&#150;12 season Batten broke the club record by scoring twenty-five tries. He became Hunslet's captain in 1911 but was transferred to Hull on 5 April 1913 for &pound;600, double the previous world record fee. His transfer came about because Batten felt he should be paid as much as contemporary colonial players in England and top association footballers were receiving. Ultimately Hull were reported to have paid Batten an unprecedented &pound;14 a match.<br>
<br>Billy Batten became the most outstanding and controversial personality in Northern Union (later rugby league) football. A centre three-quarter, weighing over 13 stone, he was regarded as the most thrustful player of his generation and the hardest-tackling back in the game. Many of his tries were scored by hurdling his opponents, a dangerous practice which was eventually outlawed. His style of play and swarthy, muscular appearance fascinated fans and made him a huge crowd-puller. His effect on the attendances at Hull was such that his &pound;600 transfer fee was recouped by the club within a few games. He scored three tries on his Hull d&eacute;but against Keighley on 12 April 1913. He became such an idol on Humberside that his absence from the team in any fixture was reckoned to cost the club &pound;100 in lost gate money. He flourished in a team strengthened by Australian imports. In 1914 he starred as Hull won the challenge cup for the first time after beating Wakefield Trinity 6&#150;0 in the final at Halifax.<br>
<br>In 1920 Batten scored the only try of the game when Hull beat Huddersfield 3&#150;2 at Headingley to lift their first rugby league championship. Hull retained the trophy in 1921 after defeating Hull Kingston Rovers in the final. In 1922 he was a try-scorer in Hull's 9&#150;10 challenge cup final defeat by Rochdale Hornets and was again a scorer when the club won its first Yorkshire challenge cup in 1923 by defeating Huddersfield 10&#150;4 in the final. Batten also helped Hull to win the Yorkshire league championship twice. In April 1920 Batten became the first player to receive a benefit of over &pound;1000 (&pound;1079), a mark of the enormous respect afforded him by the sport. He played his last game for Hull at Bramley on 5 April 1924. He was transferred to Wakefield Trinity for &pound;350, helped them to Yorkshire cup finals in 1924 (when they won) and 1926 (when they were runners-up), and finished his professional career with Castleford in 1927 before returning to the amateur ranks.<br>
<br>Batten won nineteen Yorkshire caps (1908&#150;26) and played in twenty-seven international and test matches (1908&#150;23). Despite being a centre, he played most of his games at representative level as a winger, where his damaging running was a sore trial to opponents. He made only one tour of Australasia&#151;the inaugural Lions tour of 1910, when he played in all the test matches. He declined to tour in 1914 for personal reasons and in 1920 refused to play in any tour trials, declaring that the selectors should have known enough about him after thirteen years at the pinnacle of the game.<br>
<br>Batten was a generous man, who did not forget his roots. In 1921 when the mining villages of Kinsley and Fitzwilliam were in severe hardship, he gave much of his Hull benefit proceeds to suffering villagers. On 11 January 1909 he married Ann Glover (<i>b</i>. 1887/8), a domestic servant, with whom he had eight children: William, Sydney Melbourne, Mary, Eric, Florence, Emily, Ann, and Robert. Three sons, William, Eric, and Robert, became professional rugby league players, and Eric emulated his father in playing for Yorkshire, England, and Great Britain. Two of Batten's brothers, Edward and James, were also professional players.<br>
<br>For most of his working life Batten was a colliery corporal, although he did briefly in the 1920s become the licensee of the Old King's Arms, Kirkgate, Wakefield. He served throughout the Second World War in the fire service. He died on 26 January 1959 of cardiovascular degeneration at Stanley Royd Hospital, Wakefield, and was buried four days later at Hemsworth parish church. He was survived by his wife.<br>
