<span class="headword">Walker,  (Richard) Sebastian Maynard</span>  (1942&#150;1991), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 11 December 1942 at the Imperial Nursing Home, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the only son and elder child of Richard Fife Walker, mechanical engineer, and his first wife, Christine Mary Wilkes (<i>d</i>. 1968). The family owned Walker Crosweller, makers of thermostats and shower valves. Sebastian attended the junior school of Cheltenham College and boarded at Rugby School (1956&#150;61) before going to New College, Oxford, where he took a second in French in 1965 and developed his passions for gourmet cuisine and social climbing.<br>
<br>Abandoning a doctoral thesis on French historian Jules Michelet, Walker spent a couple of years (1968&#150;70) in management training at two light engineering firms in greater London, B. Elliott of Acton and Max Fordham of Camden Town. His mother, who suffered from mental illness, committed suicide in December 1968. Walker had intended to enter the family business, but he suddenly decided otherwise in October 1970 and went into publishing. Engaged by the Chatto and Windus/Bodley Head/Jonathan Cape consortium as a sales representative, he soon became its European sales manager, travelling in France, West Germany, and Italy. In 1973 he set up home in Alwyne Place, Canonbury, London, with his homosexual lover, Donald Richards (1950/51&#150;1990), an Australian student, later a writer and stockbroker. They underwent a form of wedding ceremony. The part-work publishers Marshall Cavendish employed Walker from 1975 to 1977. Though still primarily a salesman, he also started their children's imprint. Chatto and Windus then called him back as director of children's books (1977&#150;9).<br>
<br>Perceiving a gap in the market, Walker borrowed &pound;20,000 in 1978 and formed Sebastian Walker Associates, an independent publishing house, operating from his spare bedroom. Picture books for infants were his speciality. Other publishers devoted relatively little attention to them, but they possessed two commercial advantages: a long shelf-life and international appeal. With editor Wendy Boase and designer Amelia Edwards, Walker brought to these publications the production values normally associated with books for adults. Rechristened Walker Books, his company issued its first seventeen titles in 1980. The following year it went into profit with a popular series of board books for babies by Helen Oxenbury.<br>
<br>Walker declared that he would stop at nothing to get the best children's authors and illustrators. Walker Books offered top-quality paper and colour printing and paid appreciably larger advances than competitors, who, after bitter complaints about &#145;poaching&#146;, had to follow suit. Aggressive marketing culminated in an unprecedented deal with Sainsbury's in 1985, whereby cut-price titles went on sale alongside groceries in supermarkets. Traditional booksellers were outraged; Walker Books boomed, moving via Tottenham Court Road to spacious offices in Vauxhall Walk. Its list included works by Hugh Scott, Quentin Blake, Nicola Bayley, and Jill Murphy. Critics grumbled about the low ratio of words to pictures, but Walker maintained that his products coaxed infants over the threshold of literacy.<br>
<br>Sebby Walker, a trim figure usually in an open-necked shirt, appeared to take children's books very seriously and himself not at all. Effervescent, boastful, gossipy, and apt to fantasize, he made a habit of archness, and his curly dark hair, bright eyes, and toothy grin combined with his favourite exclamations&#151;&#145;Crumbs!&#146; &#145;Golly!&#146; &#145;Horrid!&#146;&#151;to create a boyish air that neither large rimless spectacles nor latterly a beard much diminished. Money matters were &#145;a bore&#146; but being &#145;mega-rich&#146; was rather fun. He had separated from Richards (who was having an affair with Bruce Chatwin) and moved in 1982 to a fashionably minimalist studio apartment in Holland Park Road, dominated by his collection of modern British art and a concert grand piano on which he earnestly practised every day. He was a sponsor of Glyndebourne Opera and a director of the Rambert Dance Company. Best of all he liked to give parties, especially for musicians, artists, and aristocrats. While his charm and intelligence won him scores of carefully tended friendships, he still seemed an essentially solitary man without much instinctive understanding of people's feelings. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1986.<br>
<br>Employees found Walker inspirational and autocratic. There were fresh flowers on every desk and free hot lunches, but he wanted total loyalty. His obsessive perfectionism sometimes spilt over into petulance, so departures from Walker Books frequently grew acrimonious. By 1990 it was producing 300 titles per year and had an annual turnover of &pound;18 million. When he gave 51 per cent of the company to a discretionary trust for the benefit of staff, authors, and illustrators in May 1990, business rivals were puzzled, unaware that he had been diagnosed as HIV positive in autumn 1989. Sebastian Walker died at his home in Holland Park Road, London, on 16 June 1991 of an AIDS-related brain disease. He was credited with the revitalization of publishing for the very young.<br>
