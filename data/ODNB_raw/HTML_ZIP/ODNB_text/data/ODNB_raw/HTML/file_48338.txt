<span class="headword">Stevens,  Thomas</span>  (1809&#150;1888), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and educationist</span>, was born at Bradfield rectory, Berkshire, on 16 September 1809, the second son of Henry Stevens (1766&#150;1842), rector and squire of Bradfield, and his wife, Maria, daughter of William Tinney of Salisbury. Educated privately at Pyrton in Oxfordshire and Iver in Buckinghamshire, he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1827, graduating BA in 1832 and MA in 1836. Here he began a lifelong friendship with Charles Marriott and was acquainted with many of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, becoming a convinced Tractarian.<br>
<br>From 1836 to 1839 Stevens was an assistant commissioner under the 1834 <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span>, responsible for the creation of poor-law unions in Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Later he was for many years chairman of the guardians of the Bradfield Union. On 5 June 1839 he married Caroline Octavia, daughter of George Tollet of Betley Hall, Staffordshire, who died the following year. On 16 May 1843 he married Susanna, daughter of Robert Marriott, rector of Cotesbach in Leicestershire, with whom he had thirteen children. Following her death on 8 July 1866, he married in 1868 Caroline, daughter of Edward Miller, vicar of Bognor, Sussex. She died on 8 July 1881 without issue.<br>
<br>In 1839 Stevens was one of the first students at the Theological College founded by Charles Marriott in Chichester, and on 12 May was ordained as perpetual curate of Keele, Staffordshire. His elder brother having died in 1830, upon the death of his father in 1842 he became rector and squire of Bradfield, the manor and advowson of which had belonged to the family since 1751. Here he now began to put his Tractarian ideals into practice, employing Gilbert Scott to restore the parish church between 1846 and 1849. In the 1850s Bradfield became an important centre of Tractarian liturgical practice, with a full choral service twice daily attracting a number of new residents to the village and influencing other clergy such as William Butler. He selected his farm tenants and domestic servants largely on the grounds of their churchmanship.<br>
<br>The foundation of St Andrew's College, Bradfield, in 1850 was a direct result of his liturgical ambitions, the intention being that both masters and boys would sing in the parish choir. By 1860 the school had grown to 120 boys. However, parental objections to the lengthy services forced him to shorten them in 1863, and his growing debts, originating in the church restoration, were compounded by new school buildings. Although the school had been constituted as a trust in 1859, Stevens retained overall control as warden. This led to escalating conflicts of authority with the headmasters, culminating in 1879 with the head and many other staff resigning. In 1881 Stevens was declared bankrupt, and forced to relinquish his wardenship and sell his property in the village. From 1883 he was rector of Newton-with-Toft, Lincolnshire, where he died on 15 May 1888. He was buried in the family vault under Bradfield church. Much of his extensive correspondence has survived in manuscript.<br>
