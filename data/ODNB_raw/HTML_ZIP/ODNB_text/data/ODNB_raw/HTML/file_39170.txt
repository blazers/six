<span class="headword">Keynes,  (John) Neville</span>  (1852&#150;1949), <span class="occ">logician, economist, and university administrator</span>, was born on 31 August 1852 at Salisbury, Wiltshire, the only son of John Keynes (1805&#150;1878), floriculturist, and his second wife, Anna Maynard Neville. He was reared in a middle-class, staunchly nonconformist household, which included his half-sister (fourteen years his senior), his paternal grandmother, and his father's unmarried sister. At fifteen Neville went to Amersham Hall, a nonconformist boarding-school, and in 1869 he won a scholarship to University College, London. There he won both the London BA and a Cambridge college scholarship. In October 1872 the bright young nonconformist entered Pembroke, a small, traditionally Anglican college, holding its top entrance scholarship in mathematics and classics.<br>
<br>Keynes's objective was a fellowship that would enable him to pursue an academic career. He despaired of getting any intellectual stimulus from the hired coaches who crammed undergraduates for the two traditionally prestigious honours courses. However, students reading moral sciences, where classes were small, enjoyed direct personal tuition from such charismatic dons as Henry Sidgwick and Alfred Marshall on philosophy, political economy, and logic. Accordingly, he read mathematics until May, when a college examination gave him his chance to win the scholarship enabling him to read moral sciences for the next two and a half years. He also crammed successfully for both parts of the London BSc. Finally, after passing out senior moralist at the 1875 tripos, and after getting the London MA gold medal in June, he was elected a fellow of Pembroke in August 1876.<br>
<br>Over the next six years Keynes gave intercollegiate lectures on logic and political economy to honours men and students from the recently founded women's colleges, Girton and Newnham. He held a minor college office (domestic bursar) but socialized mainly with faculty colleagues and the Cambridge Congregationalist community&#151;among whom he met, and fell in love with, Florence Ada Brown (1861&#150;1958) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39171/', "Keynes, Florence Ada")</script>], the Newnhamite daughter of John Brown, minister of Bunyan Meeting, Bedford. They married in August 1882, the year when a radical reform of Cambridge college and university statutes abolished life fellowships (unless held with a major college office) and financed a redistribution of income to the university through a progressive levy on colleges. As a modern don, concerned to improve the quality of higher education in Cambridge, Keynes now focused his ambitions on the career opportunities offered by a reconstructed university, and vacated his fellowship in August 1882. He looked forward to living (and entertaining his many friends) in the family home he built for Florence and himself at 6 Harvey Road. Henceforth, he dedicated his academic talents to logic and political economy, and his managerial skills (scarce among academics) to an evolving and increasingly influential central administration.<br>
<br>Keynes's first administrative appointment was assistant secretary (1881) to the local examinations and lectures syndicate, of which he later became secretary (1892&#150;1910). Elected member of the council of the senate (1893&#150;1925), he served as its secretary (1893&#150;1925), became registrary in 1910, and remained the university's head administrator until his retirement in 1925. He was secretary to the moral sciences board for more years than any of his colleagues and its chairman from 1906 to 1912. He became chairman of the board of economics and politics (1908&#150;20), a member of Newnham College council, and served various other councils and syndicates&#151;each bringing its own load of subcommittees. In sum, throughout four decades, when the 1882 reforms were gradually transforming a loose federation of privileged clerical communities into an integrated and expanding centre of learning, education, and research, Neville Keynes's clear analytical mind, rare organizational ability, undogmatic approach, unpretentious personality, and absolute moral integrity rendered him indispensable whenever difficult or complex or controversial decisions needed to be taken and implemented at university level.<br>
<br>As logician and economist, Keynes was most productive from 1884 (when he was one of the first twenty-three lecturers appointed by Cambridge University under the new statutes) until 1911. His first book, <span class="italic">Studies and Exercises in Formal Logic</span> (1884), was a textbook on deductive logic which became a classic in its field. Written as a students' manual it was revised and enlarged to become a lecturers' bible; the fourth edition (1906) was reprinted in 1930. His second book, <span class="italic">The Scope and Method of Political Economy</span> (1891), systematically analysed the methodological debates dividing economic theorists and undermining the scientific credentials of their discipline. Writing from the perspective of the new Cambridge school of economics (founded by Marshall), Keynes clarified contentious issues and explained the approach adopted by leading contemporary theorists, in Europe and the USA as well as Britain. This carefully researched monograph attracted favourable reviews and created an international reputation for Keynes as an economist. It drew such an authoritative line under the long-running methodological debates that it soon became superfluous, except for students of the history of economic thought. The last of several revisions and reprints appeared in 1930.<br>
<br>Neville Keynes resided in Cambridge until he died there in the Evelyn Nursing Home on 15 November 1949. He was buried three days later, and a memorial service was held at Pembroke. His happy family life had been marred only by the death in 1946 of his brilliant first-born child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34310/', "John Maynard Keynes")</script>. His beloved Florence died in 1958, leaving their two other distinguished children: Margaret (the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31230/', "Archibald Vivian Hill")</script>), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31310/', "Geoffrey Langdon Keynes")</script>.<br>
