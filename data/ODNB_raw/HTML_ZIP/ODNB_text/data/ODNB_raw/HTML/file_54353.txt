<span class="headword">Kessack,  James O'Connor</span>  (1879&#150;1916), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 19 October 1879 at 1 Castle Terrace, Aberdeen, the second of nine children of James O'Connor Kessack, a baker, and his wife, Isabella <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davidson, a farmer's daughter. An unskilled labourer, he moved to Glasgow after his mother's death to seek more regular work. Following his father's death he supported the younger members of the family in Glasgow. A religious man and regular churchgoer, Kessack began to embrace socialism in the early 1900s, having hitherto rejected it. Thereafter his conversion to socialism was swift, as was his rise within the labour movement.<br>
<br>As a committed socialist, Kessack regularly addressed political meetings on behalf of the Independent Labour Party. He wrote various articles and in 1907 published his lecture to the Glasgow Clarion Scouts as <span class="italic">The Early Struggles for Political Freedom in Scotland</span>. Under pressure of work he developed a serious throat infection in 1908 and the ILP financed his visit to Arizona in search of a cure. On return he was adopted as a Labour candidate in various municipal and parliamentary divisions in the Glasgow area between 1909 and 1911. Political success eluded him, however, and thereafter he concentrated on trade union activities.<br>
<br>Kessack became national organizer for the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) in 1909, following James Larkin's dismissal the previous year. He enjoyed some success along the east coast of Scotland, but failed to win over the Clyde dockers and the Glasgow dockers in particular. The reasons behind these failures may have had more to do with his close connections with James Sexton, leader of the NUDL, than any lack of commitment to dock trade unionism on his part. He never laboured as a docker, however, and this could have worked against him as Glasgow had in the past rejected men who had no practical knowledge of dock work.<br>
<br>It would seem more likely that it was Sexton's quarrels with James Larkin that hampered Kessack's work at Glasgow. The conflict between Sexton and Larkin sent shock waves through trade union circles after Larkin was arrested, tried, and found guilty of attempting to defraud the NUDL. Indeed, Sexton gave evidence against Larkin. The Glasgow Trades Council backed a resolution, moved by Joseph Houghton, &#145;denouncing the attempt to crush Mr Jim Larkin&#146;  (Glasgow Trades Council minutes, 29 June 1910), and pronounced him innocent, which echoed the sentiments of the Glasgow dockers. Kessack had in his own words &#145;nursed the Glasgow branch like a tender baby&#146;  (Taplin, 78), but despite his undoubted popularity he could not win over a Glasgow dock labour force which actively protested against Sexton's authoritarian style of leadership.<br>
<br>Kessack initially resigned over the issue, but reconsidered after Sexton's personal intervention. In late December 1910 he sought the assistance of Glasgow Trades Council in his attempt to reorganize the Glasgow dockers. The trades council agreed and assigned a ten-man committee to this task. It was to no avail. In January 1911 Sexton officially closed down the Glasgow branch. Six months later the Glasgow dockers were reorganized under the auspices of the recently formed Scottish Union of Dock Labourers (SUDL). Joseph Houghton was elected the first general secretary of the SUDL.<br>
<br>Kessack continued with the NUDL up to 1914 and saw some considerable success, despite losing the dockers of the Clyde ports of west Scotland and Dundee and Bo'ness on the east coast to the SUDL. He reorganized the Aberdeen branch of the NUDL and set up branches in England where Ben Tillett's Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union had failed to attract support. His greatest contribution was in setting up NUDL branches at Hull, which hitherto had been the headquarters of William Collison's National Association of Free Labour and considered the epicentre of &#145;blacklegism&#146; within the port transport industry.<br>
<br>Kessack enlisted in 1914 and rose swiftly to the rank of captain by March 1916, but he died in France at the battle of the Ancre on 13 November of that year leaving a widow and two children resident in Glasgow. Despite his earlier problems with the Glasgow dockers, and for a time the SUDL leadership, he never wavered from his commitment to socialism or dock trade unionism.<br>
