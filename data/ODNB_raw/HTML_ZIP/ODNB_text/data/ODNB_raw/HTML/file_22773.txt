<span class="headword">Price,  William, the elder</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1709), <span class="occ">glass painter</span>, of whose parents nothing is known, lived in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London. He worked in Hatton Garden, and in 1683 was described as being one of only four glass painters in London. His earliest known work (1687) is a royal arms (des.) for the east window of St Andrew's, Holborn, London. In 1696 he supplied a <span class="italic">Nativity</span> (des.) for Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1701&#150;2 a <span class="italic">Life of Christ</span> for the east window of Merton College, Oxford. A coat of arms signed by him and dated 1703 is in the Hall of Trinity College, Cambridge. He became an assistant at the Glaziers' Company in 1685, upper warden in 1697, and master in 1699. His wife, Anne (or Ann) Cranley, whom he had married on 9 April 1671 at St Peter-le-Poer, London, received the administration of his estate following his death in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields in May 1709.<br>
<br>William Price's son <a name="cosubject_22758"></a><span class="headword">Joshua Price</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1672, <em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">glass painter</span>, was baptized on 11 July 1672 at St Andrew's, Holborn, London. The next reference to him appears to be an advertisement of 1705 in which he is mentioned as working with his father in Hatton Garden. In 1715 he reset the seventeenth-century glass in the chapel of Queen's College, Oxford, and supplied an east window in 1717. The following year he painted a <span class="italic">Last Supper</span> and <span class="italic">Resurrection</span> (both des.) for the east window of St Andrew's, Holborn. Between 1719 and 1721 he supplied twelve windows for the chapel of Cannons at Lord Chandos's house at Stanmore, Middlesex. Ten of these are now at Great Witley, Worcestershire, and of the other two, a <span class="italic">Conversion of St Paul</span> and a <span class="italic">Stoning of St Stephen</span>, only the former survives (in St Andrew by the Wardrobe, London). His last work, the rose window (1721&#150;2) in the north transept of Westminster Abbey, showing the apostles and evangelists, was based on cartoons by Sir James Thornhill. A contemporary account in the <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span> mentioned &#145;The great window &hellip; glazed with glass curiously painted after the Antique fashion, by Mr Price, who is reckon'd the only artist in England capable of doing it; so that that ornamental art is not so entirely lost as some have alledg'd&#146;  (23 Feb 1723). He was buried on 25 September 1722 and his wife, Elizabeth, received the administration of his estate in 1723.<br>
<br>Joshua Price's son <a name="cosubject_22773"></a><span class="headword">William Price the younger</span>  (1702<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1765) was also a <span class="occ">glass painter</span>. His earliest works of any consequence appear to be the east window (1726) of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, and the west window (1735&#150;6) of Westminster Abbey. Between 1735 and 1740 he executed five windows for New College, Oxford, followed by the east window (<i>c</i>.1742) of Turner's Hospital, Kirkleatham, Yorkshire, and the central window in the great court room of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. About 1747 he installed the windows that his father, <a href="#cosubject_22758">Joshua Price [<i>see above</i>]</a>, had made for Lord Chandos's house, in St Michael and All Angels, Great Witley, Worcestershire, adding further glass. In 1754 he carried out extensive work for James West of Alscot Park, Warwickshire, both in the house and at St Mary's, Preston-on-Stour, near by. He was almost certainly also responsible for the complete glazing of St John the Evangelist, Shobdon, Herefordshire, from 1750 to 1760, and windows at St Andrew Wimpole, Cambridgeshire. At least nineteen other works may be attributed to him, among them panels for Sir Horace Walpole, whose preferred artist he was. Walpole wrote in his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting in England</span>:<blockquote>William Price the son, now living, whose colours are fine, whose drawing good, and whose taste in ornaments and mosaic is far superior to any of his predecessors, is equal to the antique, to the good Italian masters, and only surpassed by his own singular modesty. (Walpole, 2.17)</blockquote>Price retired in 1761 and died in Great Kirby Street, Hatton Garden, London, on 16 July 1765. His obituaries described him as &#145;a Batchelor, possessed of a large fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>, 16 July 1765) and &#145;the most ingenious painter and stainer of glass in Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 347). His will, which was proved by his mother, Elizabeth George (who had remarried), his sole executor, left money and interests in mines in Flintshire, Wales.<br>
