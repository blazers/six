<span class="headword">Copeland,  William John</span>  (1804&#150;1885), <span class="occ">historian and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Chigwell, Essex, on 1 September 1804, the elder son of William Copeland, a surgeon. He entered St Paul's School, London, in 1815 and Trinity College, Oxford, in 1824, where he held a scholarship but was prevented by ill health from entering for honours and, like J. H. Newman, did not obtain the expected first-class degree. He took his BA in 1829, MA in 1831, and BD in 1840. In 1829 he was ordained to the title of St Olave Jewry but soon moved to Hackney, where he came into contact with the Hackney Phalanx of traditional high-churchmen, which included John James Watson, Watson's brother Joshua, Henry Handley Norris, and Thomas Sikes.<br>
<br>Elected a fellow of Trinity in 1832, Copeland threw himself into the circle that produced the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>, which included another fellow of the college, his close friend Isaac Williams. Copeland filled many college posts&#151;tutor, rhetorical lecturer, and vice-president&#151;being, in addition, curate of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford (1835&#150;7), and Begbroke (1838&#150;9), and helping Newman in an unofficial capacity at St Mary's. He became an authority on the Anglican divines of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, publishing an article on the non-jurors  (<span class="italic">British Critic</span>, 21, Jan 1837, 39&#150;75), the edition of Bishop Cosin in the <span class="roman">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</span> (of which he was an increasingly disillusioned superintending editor from 1840 to 1843), and the historical appendix to the published edition of Pusey's condemned sermon (1843). A respected classicist, he translated the <span class="italic">Homilies of S. John Chrysostom on the Epistle to the Ephesians</span> for the <span class="roman">Library of the Fathers</span> (1840).<br>
<br>In March 1840 Copeland became curate at Littlemore, without giving up his rooms in Trinity, spending much of his time there following Newman's resignation of St Mary's and remaining alone after the secessions of 1845. Despite many doubts at the time, he devoted himself to parish work at Garsington and the college living of Farnham, Essex, of which he was rector between 1849, when he resigned his fellowship, and his death there on 26 August 1885. He was buried on 29 August. He left his estate to his nephew, William Copeland Borlase MP.<br>
<br>A celibate priest of great humour and sympathy, of wide-ranging and deep friendships, Copeland was quite content in parish life. A small man in the side-whiskers and clerical dress of an earlier age, he judged the later ritualists kindly, looking beyond controversial dress and ceremonial to their missionary activity. A chance meeting with Newman on 3 June 1862 led to the resumption of their friendship and correspondence, Copeland editing Newman's Anglican sermons as <span class="italic">Parochial and Plain Sermons</span> (8 vols., 1868) and <span class="italic">Selection Adapted to the Seasons</span> (1878).<br>
<br>Copeland's reserve, perfectionism, and lack of ambition meant that he published little, to the exasperation of his friends. From 1860 until his death, Pusey, Newman, and Edward Churton urged him to write a history of the Oxford Movement. Pusey felt that Copeland alone could do justice to its context, origins, and early history  (Pusey to Copeland, 28 March 1866, Liddon Bound Volumes, 79/89). He possessed a formidable memory and gathered a large number of sources, from which he provided much of the historical material for Pusey's reprinted edition of <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> (1865). However, only fragments of the proposed &#145;Narrative of the Oxford Movement&#146; were dictated before his prolonged final illness left him paralysed and confused. The historiography of the movement might have been very different had it been completed. The young men involved in the disputes in Oxford in the 1830s and 1840s would have been placed in the context of an older generation working largely outside the university by one who was among the last surviving witnesses. Newman's dating the start of the movement to 1833 might not have gained such unqualified acceptance, and a more nuanced picture of the Church of England in the first third of the nineteenth century would have emerged. Copeland's library was sold, but his invaluable collection of Tractarian papers was put at the disposal of H. P. Liddon and R. W. Church and was later given to Pusey House.<br>
