<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hoffnung,  Gerard <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Gerhardt]</span></span>  (1925&#150;1959), <span class="occ">cartoonist and musical humorist</span>, was born in Gr&uuml;newald, Berlin, on 22 March 1925, the only child of German-Jewish parents, Ludwig Hoffnung, a wealthy grain merchant, and his wife, Hilde, a widow, whose first husband, Schnabel, was killed in the First World War. His mother was a keen amateur musician and artist who encouraged his artistic talents. From his earliest years he was interested in the macabre&#151;fairy tales, practical jokes, and the comic drawings of the famous German illustrators and caricaturists.<br>
<br>In the wake of the Nazi persecutions the Hoffnungs left Germany in 1938. Ludwig Hoffnung settled permanently in Israel. Gerard and his mother went to London, renting a house in Hampstead Garden Suburb which was to be Hoffnung's home for the rest of his life. In 1939 he became a pupil at Highgate School, where he was remembered for his anarchic spirit. His first cartoon was published in <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> while he was still at school. He studied at Hornsey College of Art but was expelled and became art-master at Stamford School, Lincolnshire, in 1945 and later at Harrow School. He was already working as a freelance cartoonist and his work appeared in the London <span class="italic">Evening News</span> (1947) and a number of British, continental, and American magazines including <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <span class="italic">Strand Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. He also produced advertising work for Kia-Ora, Guinness, and other companies. He held several one-man exhibitions of his work, including those at the Little Gallery, Piccadilly (1949), and the Royal Festival Hall, London, in 1951 and 1956.<br>
<br>Hoffnung developed a distinctive style which owed something to the German illustrator Wilhelm Busch. He mainly drew with a mapping pen and Indian ink, and also used watercolours and wax crayons. His illustrations in colour for Colette's libretto for Ravel's opera <span class="italic">L'enfant et les sortil&egrave;ges</span> were outstanding. Much of his humour centred on the world of music, particularly the various instruments of the orchestra with which he was fascinated. (He taught himself to play the tuba.) In 1953 he published <span class="italic">The Maestro</span>, the first of a series of six little books of cartoons on musical themes which had a worldwide success. They were animated by Halas-Batchelor with music by Francis Chagrin in the television series <span class="italic">Tales from Hoffnung</span> (1965), and were available on gramophone records, as were several of his humorous speeches and broadcasts. He broke new ground in musical humour when in 1956 he organized the first of a series of concerts of symphonic caricature at which new music, some of it by respected composers such as Malcolm Arnold, was played on ludicrous instruments or to the accompaniment of vacuum cleaners or road rammers. These &#145;April Fools Concerts&#146; in Liverpool and Hoffnung Music Festivals in London became more and more elaborate and proved highly popular with the public.<br>
<br>In 1950 Hoffnung began a career as a broadcaster, during the course of which he made many appearances on the radio as both raconteur and panel member. He was a brilliant improviser with a dry wit and a masterly sense of timing. An Oxford Union speech in 1958 in which he told &#145;The story of the bricklayer&#146; became a classic recording. The story, involving a bricklayer's misfortunes as he attempted to lower some bricks in a barrel from the top of a building, was not especially funny, but his manner and delivery reduced his audience to hysterics. Other publications include <span class="italic">Ho Ho Hoffnung</span> and <span class="italic">Hoffnung's Acoustics</span> (both 1959) and a number of posthumous collections of his drawings and cartoons. He also provided illustrations for works by other writers, including J. Broughton's <span class="italic">The Right Playmate</span> (1951).<br>
<br>In appearance Hoffnung was stocky, bald, and benign. Nicolas Bentley described him as looking like a &#145;Teutonic Pickwick&#146;. His manner, voice, and looks were those of a much older man and his wife was sometimes mistaken for his daughter. A man of conscience, he was a Quaker and a prison visitor. In 1952 he married Annetta Perceval, daughter of Percy Alfred Bennett, electrical contractor, of Folkestone, Kent. They had one son and one daughter. Hoffnung was only thirty-four when he died of a cerebral haemorrhage in New End Hospital, London, on 28 September 1959. He was survived by his wife. Posthumous exhibitions of his work include those at the Berlin festival (1964); the Brighton and Edinburgh festivals (1968); the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York (1970); and Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham, London (1992).<br>
