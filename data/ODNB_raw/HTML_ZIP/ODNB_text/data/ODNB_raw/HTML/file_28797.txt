<span class="headword">Warton <span class="st"> [Perfey]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1557), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, is of obscure origins. He composed his will as Robert Perfey and made bequests in it to a brother, a sister, and several kinsfolk with the same surname. But he is first recorded on 1 September 1525 as Robert Warton, a Cluniac monk who was chosen as his successor by the retiring prior of Bermondsey. In the same year Warton is said to have taken the degree of BTh at Cambridge, and he may also have studied at Gloucester College, Oxford. In the Canterbury convocations of 1533 and 1534 he supported the king against papal authority, which makes it less surprising that on 8 June 1536 he should have been elected bishop of St Asaph. The royal assent was given on 24 June, he was consecrated by Archbishop Cranmer eight days later, and the temporalities were restored on 21 July. The see was extremely poor, and Warton retained his abbacy <i>in commendam</i>. When Bermondsey was dissolved at the beginning of 1538, Warton received the substantial pension of &pound;333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., no doubt to enable him to fulfil his episcopal duties.<br>
<br>Warton's predecessor as bishop had been the committed evangelical William Barlow, but Barlow was not at St Asaph for long enough to make much impact on the legacy of the conservative Henry Standish, who held the see from 1518 to 1535. Warton seems to have begun his episcopate by taking a reformist line, expelling a priest from the diocese &#145;for not rasing the bishop of Rome's name and other crimes&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 10, no. 446), but his commitment to reform soon faltered. He appears to have been more interested in administration than doctrine, securing the support of a number of suffragans and recommending the removal of his see first to Wrexham and then to Denbigh, where he also showed a concern for education by proposing the establishment of a grammar school. Warton also had to contend with the rapacity of the locally powerful Salisbury family. Later allegations that he impoverished his see by making long leases of all its lands are probably exaggerated, but his recorded leases include one to Richard Salisbury for sixty years and one to the younger John Salisbury for eighty.<br>
<br>Although Warton certainly visited his diocese, staying at Denbigh or Wrexham rather than St Asaph, he was frequently employed outside it. He attended important court events like the baptism of Prince Edward and the funeral of Queen Jane Seymour in 1537, and the marriage of Henry VIII to Anne of Cleves in 1540. In 1537 he was a signatory to the <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span>, and two years later was consulted about the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>. He several times attended parliament in the 1540s. Meanwhile he retained an interest in Surrey, as a JP and property-owner&#151;in 1542 he was licensed to acquire nine messuages in Bermondsey. By 1542 Warton was also coming to be employed in the secular government of Wales and its marches. In that year he was made a JP for Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, and he was later named to the peace commissions for Shropshire, Herefordshire, Chester, and Staffordshire, while on 22 April 1543 he was appointed to the council in the marches of Wales.<br>
<br>Following the death of Henry VIII, Warton accommodated himself without difficulty to the governments of the dukes of Somerset and Northumberland. In 1547 he voted in favour of holy communion being administered in both kinds, and seems to have supported the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> of 1549. In April 1551 he was again named to the council in the marches of Wales. But following the death of Edward VI he found it equally easy to adapt to a more conservative religious regime. Appointed on 13 March 1554 to the commission to deprive Archbishop Holgate and four other bishops, he was formally absolved of error and schism by Cardinal Pole on the 17th, and nominated on the same day for translation to the see of Hereford; he was enthroned on 9 May. Little can be said of his second episcopate, except that he acted as the government required to deprive married clergy.<br>
<br>In his will, which he drew up on 30 June 1555, Warton showed his concern for his cathedral by leaving to it his mitre, crozier, and a number of fine vestments, and making bequests to all the prebendaries, vicars-choral, choristers, and officers who should be present at his funeral mass. He also remembered his chaplains, household servants, and numerous kinsmen, making individual cash bequests totalling over &pound;450. &pound;20 were to be distributed to the poor at his burial, another &pound;20 at his month's mind. His bequest of his soul, to the glorious Trinity, was surprisingly lacking in specifically Catholic commitment for a Marian bishop, but it is probably significant that his nephew John Perfey, whom he named as his executor, later fled overseas to escape the Elizabethan settlement. Warton died on 22 September 1557. Little remains of his monumental effigy in the north-east transept of Hereford Cathedral, and he may be more worthily commemorated by an embroidered orphrey bearing his arms which survives at St Michael's Church, Abergavenny.<br>
