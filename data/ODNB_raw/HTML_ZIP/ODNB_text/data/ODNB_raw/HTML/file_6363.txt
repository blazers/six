<span class="headword">Coryate,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1607), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was born in St Thomas's parish, Salisbury, where his family appears to have been long settled; educated at Salisbury Free School and Winchester College, he proceeded to New College, Oxford, where he became a probationary fellow on 15 December 1560 (some months after Michael Maschiart, a fellow Latinist of his native parish), perpetual fellow in 1562, BA in March 1564, MA in July 1569, and BD on 12 July 1582. He was appointed vicar of Hilmarton, Wiltshire, in 1567, rector of Donington in 1570, and in June of the same year rector of Odcombe, Somerset, the place that his peripatetic son was to immortalize. While remaining at Odcombe, he obtained some further preferments, culminating in a prebend at York, 1595. According to H. Hatcher (writing in Hoare's <span class="italic">Modern Wiltshire</span>), he married one Henrietta Cooper; he later married Gertrude Williams(?) (<i>d</i>. 1645), and they had one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6364/', "Thomas Coryate (1577?&#150;1617)")</script>.<br>
<br>Coryate was &#145;much commended in his time for his fine fancy in Latin poetry, and for certain matters which he had written&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.774), as quoted by several contemporary writers of unimpeachable seriousness; &#145;at a time when a talent for Latin poetry was an enviable accomplishment, he was celebrated for his Latin verses&#146;  (Hoare, 6.619). His son Thomas published the <span class="italic">Posthuma fragmenta poematum Georgii Coryati Sarisburiensis</span> at the end of his celebrated <span class="italic">Crudities</span> (1611), with a dedicatory letter to Henry, prince of Wales, explaining his motives for rescuing his father's work &#145;ex Cimmeriis illis tenebris&#146; (&#145;from outer darkness&#146;). George himself, shortly before his death, had expressed the hope that his early writings might be printed; his friends had sought publication as a memorial. He had been honoured by the notice of James Middendorp, and the philosopher John Case had quoted his lines on Oxford and Cambridge  (Case, 153), written about forty years previously, along with many others &#145;de descriptione Angliae, Scotiae, et Hyberniae&#146;. At least 2000 lines, composed in his prime, &#145;elegantibus sane ac a viris eruditis non parum laudatis&#146; (&#145;elegant, applauded by the learned&#146;) had vanished, through the author's carelessness or the action of time and bookworms (&#145;tineis edacibus corrosis&#146;). Thus &#145;Thomas Coryatus Odcombiensis, peregrinans pedesterrimus&#146; begs Henry's favour against snapping critics, &#145;virulentos Momorum morsus&#146;.<br>
<br>The first group of surviving verses were written at Winchester, for Queen Elizabeth's visit in August 1560; Coryate urges her to marry, in elegiacs clever and lively enough to earn a reward. At Oxford he paraphrased the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> (a common way of combining devotion with neo-Latin virtuosity); sixteen virtuoso acrostic lines survive, dedicating that exercise to the queen. In &#145;Viridis draconis triumphus&#146; Coryate laments William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, then turns to his son Henry (who made him his chaplain); he shows skill in handling about 100 hexameters, which do at least demonstrate the superior elegance of Latin, when compared with the accompanying vernacular fourteeners, &#145;The Pembroke dragon, greene of hue, good reader, here behold&#146;.<br>
<br>Astronomical verses by Coryate to the chancellors of the universities (Leicester and Burghley) were recited in New College hall, neatly comparing them to the two pole-stars  (Coryate, 1905 edn, 2.397). Burghley received several other sets of verses, with medical advice on the power of song, and gave Coryate 40<i>s</i>.; his poem of thanks refers to &#145;illustrissima tua uxor&#146; (the learned Mildred, Lady Burghley), and her poem to Buchanan. Coryate complained to Burghley, in forty-two elegiacs, of &#145;Pseudocausidicos se injuste opprimentes&#146; (&#145;false advocates unjustly accusing him&#146;; ibid., 2.399). He wrote also to Lord Keeper Puckering. Bishops Jewel and Piers of Salisbury are each mourned as his &#145;Maecenas optimus&#146;. He puns wittily on Piers (later archbishop of York) and Perseus. Epitaphs include a clever multiple acrostic on Anne Clifton; another commemorates eight members of the Worsley family, two blown up by gunpowder. Archbishop Whitgift received an elaborate acrostic. Coryate's various patrons were not fools; he showed mastery of a valued accomplishment. He died at the parsonage at Odcombe on 4 March 1607; his son preserved his body until 14 April, when he was buried in the chancel at Odcombe. Thomas could no doubt thank his father for the fluency in spoken and written Latin, as well as the confident eccentricity, with which he toured Europe.<br>
