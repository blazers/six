<span class="headword">Currie,  Bertram Wodehouse</span>  (1827&#150;1896), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 25 November 1827, at Harley Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48015/', "Raikes Currie (1801&#150;1881)")</script>, banker and MP for Northampton (1835&#150;57), and his wife, the Hon. Laura Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1869), daughter of the second Baron Wodehouse. John Wodehouse, first earl of Kimberley, was his cousin. He had three brothers (of whom the youngest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32674/', "Philip Henry Wodehouse Currie")</script>, was created Baron Currie in 1899) and two sisters. He was educated at Cheam under the progressive Dr Mayo, who taught him with such terrifying realism about the &#145;last trump&#146; that he would jump out of his skin when someone blew a cornet in the street. Afterwards he was at Eton College (1840&#150;45) and he also studied at Weimar, in Germany, where he became proficient in foreign languages.<br>
<br>After returning to London, Currie entered his father's banking business at 29 Cornhill, in the City, in 1847. He was not his father's favourite son, and his acute business sense was not fully appreciated until at his instigation the bank amalgamated with Glyn, Mills to become Glyn, Mills, Currie, in 1864. He married on 31 October 1860 Caroline Louisa (1836/7&#150;1902), daughter of Sir William Lawrence Young, fourth baronet, Conservative MP for Buckinghamshire from 1835 to 1842. They had two sons.<br>
<br>After the Overend Gurney crisis of 1866 Currie emerged as the dominant partner in the bank, and he soon secured his reputation as one of the most intelligent leaders of the banking community. The first chairman of Glyn, Mills, Currie was George Glyn, afterwards first Baron Wolverton; Currie's reservations about him reveal his own epicureanism and his admiration for versatility, erudition, and vision:<blockquote>If he had not been so engrossed in the details of business, and if his domestic environment had been a little more intellectual and aesthetic, his natural talent for conversation and society would &hellip; have been developed &hellip; but the puritanical and philistine element which prevailed in his days in the banking and mercantile world checked his flight, and made his private life somewhat colourless. (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.95)</blockquote>Currie's ambitions for himself were cut in the opposite pattern to Wolverton's. He took broad views, and had wide interests outside the bank parlour, but never compromised his dedication to private banking by accepting other commercial responsibilities. It was at Currie's prompting that Glyn, Mills, Currie became a joint-stock company in 1885. Currie was instrumental in financing the Manchester Ship Canal in the late 1880s. He had a lifelong friendship with Edward Baring, first Baron Revelstoke, and together with William Lidderdale of the Bank of England he was crucial during the Baring crisis of 1890 in averting a collapse in financial confidence. On 11 February 1891 E. W. Hamilton of the Treasury called him &#145;the ablest of all City authorities&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 48655, fol. 27).<br>
<br>In the City, Currie was not a representative figure. He advocated reformation of the corporation of London:<blockquote>The perpetual guzzling of Aldermen and Common Councillors, the jobbing in City lands, in which some of them were notoriously engaged, their want of public spirit, the cadging for subscriptions on every possible occasion, the thirst of Mayors and Recorders for titles and orders&#151;all these excited my bile. (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.83&#150;4)</blockquote>Currie was chairman of the City of London Liberal Association at a time when most City leaders had abandoned Liberalism. The &#145;boredom and banality&#146; of parliamentary life, however, deterred him from a candidacy  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.82&#150;3). He advised W. E. Gladstone on financial topics, lent his Whitehall house to the Gladstones when they left Downing Street in 1885, and also put at their disposal his Surrey house, where the Grand Old Man once held a meeting of ministers. Gladstone much appreciated Currie's &#145;unbounded kindness&#146; on these occasions  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 11.129). Currie supported Gladstone's Irish policy, and in 1892 he mediated on his behalf with Henry Labouchere when the latter pressed his claim to office in the incoming Liberal administration.<blockquote>To have known Mr Gladstone, and to have enjoyed his friendship, is among the most interesting events of my life &hellip; I have never conversed with any man whose intellectual superiority I was so ready to acknowledge, or who &hellip; was so free from the demon of commonplace. (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.84)</blockquote>Currie was not a democrat, but exclusive and invidious in his judgements; he supported Robert Lowe's arguments against extending the franchise in 1866 and he mistrusted Rosebery's admiration of Bismarck. He described himself as having an &#145;anxious and apprehensive temperament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.53).<br>
<br>Currie's opinions were valued by Sir Reginald Welby and other Treasury officials. As financial member of the Council of India from 1880 to 1895, he steadily gained in authority and expertise. He also testified to the gold and silver commission in 1887, was a delegate at the Brussels International Monetary Conference of 1892, where he was a ruthless, sarcastic opponent of bimetallism, and served on the Indian currency committee, in 1893, and on the Irish finance committee. As a monometallist he contributed to the <span class="italic">National Review</span> in June 1895 and promoted the Gold Standard Defence Association in that year (he was chairman in 1895&#150;6).<br>
<br>Currie bought a suburban villa, Coombe Warren, near Kingston upon Thames in Surrey, which had been built in 1868 by the father of John Galsworthy and which was immortalized in <span class="italic">The Forsyte Saga</span>. There and at Minley Manor on Bagshot Heath in Hampshire, which he inherited from his father, he indulged his &#145;mania for building and making gardens&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.58). In both counties he was a magistrate; he was also high sheriff of London in 1892, and high steward of Kingston upon Thames in 1893. He despised the mediocrity of his suburban neighbours:<blockquote>Nothing can be so utterly banal and uninspiring for the young as the associations of the modern suburban villa. Villadom has already given its name to a school of politicians distinguished for the absence of ideas, for the glorification of chauvinism, for faith in such patriots as that precious pair of knights, Sir Ashmead Bartlett and Sir Howard Vincent. (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.37)</blockquote>Such fastidious scorn explains the description of him by Constance Smith (mother of Vivian Smith, first Baron Bicester): &#145;extremely clever, intellectual and agreeable &hellip; an avowed and mocking Atheist, extremely satirical and cynical, and I have never dined there without hearing him pass bitter and ironical remarks upon people&#146;  (Kynaston, 1.295). Currie visited Brazil in 1849 and the USA in 1850, and travelled extensively in Europe, but latterly railed against the effects of mass tourism.<br>
<br>In December 1895 Currie underwent an operation for cancer of the tongue; after cancer reappeared in his neck glands he was told in August 1896 by Henry Butlin that his case was hopeless. He retired immediately from business. Two months later he was received into the Roman Catholic church to the high gratification of his wife (who had converted in 1862). Although Hamilton believed Currie's conversion was chiefly intended &#145;to please his wife before his death&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 48670, fol. 89), the religious testimony which he wrote at this time has the hallmark of sincerity. He died on 29 December 1896, at 1 Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, London, survived by his wife.<br>
