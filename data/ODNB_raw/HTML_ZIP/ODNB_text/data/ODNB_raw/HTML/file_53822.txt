<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Silcox,  Lucy Mary</span>  (1862&#150;1947), <span class="occ">headmistress and feminist</span>, was born on 11 July 1862 at Warminster, Wiltshire, the eldest of four daughters of the Revd John Wesley Silcox, Methodist minister, and his wife, Betsy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parkinson. She was educated at Chelsea High School for Girls and at Newnham College, Cambridge, 1881&#150;5. She was awarded a college scholarship in 1883 and passed part two of the classical tripos with first-class honours, later becoming a distinguished associate of Newnham College for thirty years from 1894.<br>
<br>Between 1885 and 1889 Lucy Silcox worked as a teacher of classics at the recently founded Liverpool High School for Girls, where, as her pupil Mary Sheepshanks testified: &#145;Her flashing eyes and gypsy look gave a hint of a warm and tempestuous nature, and her recherch&eacute; and at times exotic dress expressed a love of beauty which in her was a dominating passion. &hellip; Lucy Silcox gave and inspired love&#146;  (Sheepshanks). In 1890 Lucy Silcox was appointed the (very young) first headmistress of the new <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94164', "Girls' Public Day School Company")</script> East Liverpool High School for Girls. Soon after taking up that post she made time after school hours to coach, successfully, an ill-prepared Eleanor Rathbone in Latin and Greek for Oxford. She was succeeded as head of East Liverpool by her younger sister Alice. From 1900 to 1908 Lucy Silcox was headmistress of West Dulwich High School for Girls, and finally, between 1909 and 1926, she was head of the girls' public boarding-school St Felix, Southwold (founded in 1897).<br>
<br>Lucy Silcox, in the judgement of those who encountered her, including Sir Ernest Gowers, was &#145;one of the greatest headmistresses of all time&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Felician</span>, Sept 1946&#150;7, 8). She was an idealist in her educational philosophy, dedicated to inspiring her pupils with a love of beauty, goodness, and truth; to that end she tried to allow the girls the maximum freedom, both in their choice of studies and in their organization of the school. She believed in treating the girls as reasonable people, capable of self-government and self-imposed discipline&#151;there was extraordinarily little &#145;policing&#146; by the staff. In her first address at St Felix, Lucy Silcox described the school as a ship in which each member felt her partial responsibility for the well-being of the whole, and where there was &#145;a real spontaneity and elasticity and freedom [in] the give and take with each other &hellip;&#151;the giving and asking for nothing in return, &hellip; which alone is free from the spirit of barter&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Felician</span>, July 1909, 5&#150;6). In her time at St Felix, Lucy Silcox could not shower enough beauty and intellectual inspiration on &#145;her&#146; school. There were music recitals by Viennese chamber quartets and Myra Hess&#151;who had to have her Steinway steered delicately up the fire escape into the Hall&#151;and by Adele Focini who played Brahms on her great-uncle Joachim's violin; talks by the poets De La Mare, Masefield, and Rabindranath Tagore; visits by the painters Cammaerts and Walter Sickert, who, alone, was a disaster. Lucy Silcox collected good paintings and fine pieces of old furniture for the school and she herself directed the girls in Greek plays, sometimes partly in her own translation: <span class="italic">Iphigenia in Tauris</span>, <span class="italic">Antigone</span>, <span class="italic">The Trojan Women</span>. As her way of commemorating the suffering and needed rebirth after the First World War, she managed to acquire a Mestrovic bust of a young girl for the school and she planted a large, sunken water garden in the grounds.<br>
<br>Lucy Silcox's socio-political commitment was feminist and humane. Her life's work as a teacher testified to her belief in the education of girls and, before the First World War, she campaigned actively for the vote. Not only was she president of her local branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies but she also toured the surrounding Suffolk villages, speaking up for &#145;the cause&#146; from her pony trap. Sometimes an apple would be shied at her, but much more often she would hold her audience. She also worked, successfully, for the election of women candidates in local government. During the First World War&#151;a very difficult period for the school since it was evacuated three times and one part split off to what the girls called the Funkhole in deepest Wales&#151;Lucy Silcox would testify to unpopular moral restraint in warfare. One pupil never forgot how &#145;We had been receiving news of some new atrocity perpetrated by the Germans, which had caused much controversy about the rightness or advisability of retaliating in kind. Miss Silcox revealed her thinking on the situation by quoting from a classical author who had said &#147;If we perish we perish but we will not do this thing&#148;&#146;  (private letter from Rose Tebbutt, 7 May 1990, St Felix School Archive).<br>
<br>Possessing a passionate temperament, which could occasionally descend into immediately repented temper, Lucy Silcox was an eager, loving friend, the brilliance and colour of her appearance expressing an inner fire. Her friends included Jane Harrison, John Masefield, Gilbert Murray (who wrote a tribute to her in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, January 1947), Bertrand Russell, Paul Nash, Ray Strachey, and Eleanor Rathbone, but her lifelong companion was the fellow headmistress Olive Dymond, whom she had first met at Newnham. Her limp, the legacy from infantile paralysis, never prevented her from strenuous travels, exploring with gusto Corsica, Spain, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and of course, Greece. Her remarkable face with its large liquid eyes, wide forehead, strong mouth, and map of lines has been finely drawn by many artists, including Stanley Spencer. Lucy Silcox died on 11 January 1947 at her home, Foxcombe End, Boars Hill, Oxford, listening to a favourite symphony with friends, and was buried in Oxford. She left 2000 books and her collection of paintings by Corot, Derain, Gertler, Christopher Wood, Matthew Smith, Chirico, Epstein, Ivon Hitchens, Frances Hodgkins, and Vanessa Bell to be shared between St Felix and Newnham. The paintings were sold to Leicester Art Gallery. A uniquely vivid, magnetic personality, no one who knew Lucy Silcox ever forgot her.<br>
