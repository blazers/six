<span class="headword">Dodd,  Thomas</span>  (1771&#150;1850), <span class="occ">printseller and author</span>, was born in Spitalfields on 11 July 1771, the eldest child of Elizabeth Tooley, tailor, and her husband, Thomas Dodd, also a tailor. At the age of five he moved with his family across London, to settle in Paradise Row, Chelsea, where he attended a local dame-school. Although his family were humble, this must have been a period of prosperity, as shortly afterwards the young Dodd was transferred to a private academy at Shooters Hill to study under a tutor named Dufour. He remained there until his father, who had habitually absented himself for lengthy periods, finally abandoned the family in 1781, leaving Dodd's mother to provide them with a meagre living. In such straitened circumstances, Dodd was sent to work with the flamboyant American impresario Colonel de Vaux, who planned to establish a juvenile band and taught the boy the clarinet. Under the protection of Vaux, this ensemble travelled through England, stopping to perform in various town squares; the experience must have encouraged Dodd's willingness to travel in later life.<br>
<br>Within a year Vaux had given up this enterprise, leaving Dodd to lodge with a butcher named Chapman where he was ill-treated; within another year the boy ran away to Liverpool in pursuit of his charismatic master. After wandering, penniless, he eventually found Vaux and travelled with him to Llanrwst where he was again abandoned; this time, however, he was left in the care of an itinerant harp player who, although he neglected Dodd's well-being, did teach him to play the harp. Ever resourceful and seemingly hardened to such set-backs, Dodd earned his board by performing for a local Welsh innkeeper and then for the Revd John Royle. These teenage exploits were later recorded, though probably in a romanticized form, in an autobiographical manuscript (now lost) entitled &#145;A narrative of incidents and adventures in my progress of life&#146;, which Dodd eventually presented to his friend Joseph Mayer.<br>
<br>By 1788 Dodd had returned to London, where he accepted a menial post in the house of an uncle before taking up service as a footman, first for &#145;Mrs Stuart [of] 48, Weymouth Street, Portland Place&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 481), and then for Timothy Mangles of Suffolk Lane. Finally, these domestic positions afforded Dodd sufficient security to pursue his new desire for self-education. Between 1790 and 1793, with access to Mangles's library, he read voraciously, particularly favouring treatises on drawing; he also taught himself to copy engravings. In 1794 he married Miss Mangles's maid and then took up employment as a clerk at the chancery court. This position exploited his draughtsmanship and writing skills and allowed him further time to indulge his passion for prints and to frequent auctions where he would buy miscellaneous lots of prints and cheap books.<br>
<br>On the basis of these activities, in 1796 Dodd opened his first print shop, in Lambeth Marsh, where he came under the influence of William Henry Ireland, the infamous forger of Shakespeare, who encouraged him to excise flyleaves from the many old books in his stock; this was to supply Ireland with suitably aged paper for his own counterfeiting activities. Dodd apparently remained unaware of Ireland's ulterior motives and his own comments on this period describe his intense and devoted study of the history of engraving. After such a chequered start, Dodd had finally fixed on his vocation and by 1798 he had moved his print shop to the more fashionable and competitive location of Tavistock Street, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>With his charismatic personality and his remarkable knowledge of prints, Dodd's shop soon became a resort for many of the leading printmakers, collectors, and connoisseurs of the day. By 1806 his stock had grown so large that he moved to premises in St Martin's Lane, where he also began to hold auctions; by 1809 he had established his reputation with the auction of General Dowdeswell's celebrated engraved portrait collection, which raised sums far in advance of those paid by their original collector. He also held successful auctions in Portsmouth, Liverpool, and Manchester but by 1817, in the aftermath of Waterloo, Dodd lost his London business and so relocated to Manchester where the competition was not so great. Between 1817 and 1825 he continued to hold auctions; he also played an active part in the northern intellectual and art worlds and was influential in the formation of the Royal Manchester Institution in 1823.<br>
<br>During a prolonged illness in 1818&#150;19 the largely self-taught Dodd started to write pieces on the history of engraving and the lives of engravers. The first was his &#145;Dissertation on the origin of the art of engraving&#146;, a lecture delivered in Liverpool in 1819. This was followed by a long-term project to compile a biographical history of the arts; it began publication in 1824 under the title <span class="italic">The Connoisseurs Repertory</span>, and it was in the interest of research that Dodd returned to London in 1825. The book, however, was quickly discontinued as its publisher went bankrupt. Consequently, although he continued to conduct some independent sales, Dodd was forced to take up the position of foreman for his former rival, the auctioneer Martin Colnaghi, for only &pound;4 per week. This job was not without benefits: after he had catalogued Lord Yarborough's collection for sale by Colnaghi, the Bodleian Library invited Dodd, as a now renowned authority, to catalogue the 50,000 prints left to them on the death of Francis Douce; however, the catalogue was found inadequate and was never printed. In 1842 he was invited to catalogue Horace Walpole's collections at Strawberry Hill for the auctioneer George Robins.<br>
<br>Undeterred by this change in fortunes, during his final years Dodd continued to compile notes on the history of engraving and his most important contribution to the history of art is his extensive manuscript &#145;Memoirs of English engravers, 1550&#150;1800&#146; (now in the British Library, London), which he is said to have completed two days before his death. He died at the home of Joseph Mayer, in Lord Street, Liverpool, on 17 August 1850 and was buried in St James's cemetery in Liverpool.<br>
