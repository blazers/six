<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brainin,  Norbert</span>  (1923&#150;2005), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born on 12 March 1923 in Vienna, Austria, the son of Adolf Brainin (<i>d</i>. 1930), furrier, and his wife, Sophie (<i>d</i>. 1938). He was raised in the Jewish faith. Even though his parents must have felt the impact of the economic downturn that brought the country to its financial knees in the early 1920s, he seems to have enjoyed all the trappings of a relatively wealthy central European childhood. Like others from similar backgrounds, he was introduced to music at an early age. As a boy of six he heard the thirteen-year-old Yehudi Menuhin play in Vienna in 1929. Overwhelmed by the experience, the young Brainin immediately decided to become a violinist, a course from which he never wavered. He began violin lessons at the age of seven with his cousin, Max, an architect and a passionate amateur musician. Under his tutelage Brainin progressed quickly on his quarter-size instrument and it was soon clear that he needed to be taught professionally. After being tutored by a series of teachers that included Theodore Paschkus, Solomon Auber, and Heinrich Schwarz, Brainin became a pupil of the nineteen-year-old leader of the Vienna Philharmonic, Ricardo Odnoposoff, at the Vienna Conservatory from 1933 to 1935. But it was Rosa Hochmann-Rosenfeld who probably influenced him most, because it was she who introduced him both to chamber music and to the great violin pedagogue Carl Flesch.<br>
<br>In 1938 Brainin was struck by two severe blows: the death of his mother and the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. Having been orphaned at the age of fifteen, he was raised by one of his paternal uncles, with whom he later fled to London. Although the Brainins were &eacute;migr&eacute;s and were unfamiliar with Britain, they quickly recognized the commercial possibilities that Europe's biggest metropolis had to offer and soon began to trade as furriers in fashionable New Bond Street. Nevertheless, Brainin must have felt the trauma of displacement, because shortly after arriving in England he became involved with some of the refugee groups that had sprung up around the capital. As an affable and talented young man he rapidly became a familiar face at those gatherings by playing at some of their concerts. His education also progressed apace in England, where he attended a boarding school at Leigh-on-Sea and where he began to take lessons with Carl Flesch. But Brainin's relationship with Flesch was short-lived, since Flesch fled London for The Hague in anticipation of the blitz. (He subsequently spent two years in Nazi-occupied Holland before being allowed to move first to Budapest and then to Lucerne, where he died in 1944.) Continuity was achieved at least in part, however, when Brainin was accepted as a pupil by Flesch's assistant, Max Rostal.<br>
<br>Brainin's musical education was again interrupted when in 1940 he was interned as an enemy alien at a camp in Prees Heath, Shropshire. Although he worked as a machine tool fitter at the camp, music remained his passion and he soon sought out others who shared his enthusiasm. As a teenager he was naturally drawn to other internees of the same age, and among the friends that he made at the camp was the young Austrian violinist Peter Schidlof (1922&#150;1987). Schidlof was also of Jewish descent but had been educated at a Roman Catholic boarding school. His early musical education was equally unconventional, because his first violin lessons were with the local blacksmith's son. After arriving in Britain as a refugee in 1938 he attended Blundell's School at Tiverton in Devon, before being interned. After Brainin was released later in 1940, Schidlof was moved from Shropshire to a camp on the Isle of Man, where he befriended yet another young Austrian-Jewish violinist, Siegmund Nissel (1922&#150;2008), who had fled Vienna on the last <i>Kindertransport</i> in 1938.<br>
<br>By 1941 Brainin, Schidlof, and Nissel had all been released from internment and were able to continue their studies with Max Rostal. After the war they joined the Rostal Chamber Orchestra and it was as members of that group that they met the young English cellist Martin Lovett (<i>b</i>. 1927), the fourth member of what was to become the Amadeus Quartet. Brainin was now part of an exciting nexus of young musicians and his playing went from strength to strength; he won the gold medal at the international Carl Flesch violin competition in London in 1946 with a performance of Brahms's violin concerto, and went on to play Beethoven's violin concerto with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1948.<br>
<br>For a young virtuoso the lure of a solo career must have been very tempting, but chamber music was never far from Brainin's thoughts and when Schidlof converted successfully from the violin to the viola, they joined with Nissel and Lovett to form the Brainin Quartet. With a unified playing style that benefited from their close contact with Rostal the group quickly came to the attention of some of Britain's leading musicians. One of the first to be impressed by the quartet's playing was Imogen Holst, who invited them to perform at Dartington Hall on 13 July 1947. For Brainin that performance was an artistic epiphany, and in later life he recalled that:<blockquote>something decisive happened, in my head, my soul, and my heart; and this was entirely caused by the music we played. Above all, by Beethoven's quartets, but also by those of Schubert, Mozart, and Haydn &hellip; I couldn't <i>think</i> about anything else &hellip; Already in 1947 I sensed, that playing string quartets would become the purpose of my life. (www.schillerinstitute.org)</blockquote>With the success of the Dartington Hall concert behind them Brainin, Schidlof, Nissel, and Lovett made their Wigmore Hall d&eacute;but as the Amadeus Quartet on 10 January 1948, having decided that a more neutral name would serve their purposes better. News of this sensational band of young players spread like wildfire through the close-knit chamber music community. Demand for tickets for their Wigmore Hall concert soon far outstripped supply and those lucky enough to secure a seat began to sing the quartet's musical praises, both nationally and internationally. Central Europe was conquered next and it was at Hamburg that the quartet made its German d&eacute;but in 1950. There the young players caused a sensation, prompting &#145;the audience in its enthusiasm almost [to] smash &hellip; the entire hall&#146;  (www.schillerinstitute.org). News of that success soon attracted wider interest and the group then toured America and the world in 1953 and 1954 respectively. On 17 April 1948 Brainin had married Kathe, the 29-year-old former wife of Hans Helmut Block, and daughter of Hugo Kottow, a German grain merchant; they had one daughter, Anne.<br>
<br>Although clearly gifted the quartet benefited greatly from the advent of long-playing records and it was through these that its fame and performance style reached a wider audience. As three of the ensemble's members had been born in central Europe, it was almost inevitable that the group would become associated with the works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert. Their interpretations of Schubert's music were particularly highly regarded and their recordings of that composer's &#145;Trout&#146; quintet with the pianist Clifford Curzon and of the C major quintet, first with William Pleeth and later with Robert Cohen, became benchmarks against which all other recordings of those works were judged. For Brainin, however, it was the music of Beethoven that was the greatest challenge for a chamber musician, and he later argued that if &#145;a violinist &hellip; cannot play the Beethoven quartets, that is who hasn't the equipment to play them, [he] is not a violinist in the fullest possible sense&#146;. Moreover, he felt that a &#145;certain technique is involved&#146; in playing those works and that in order &#145;to do justice to the music, the expression, and all that is necessary, you must have this technique&#146;. According to Brainin the style of violin playing that was taught in Vienna equipped a player best for this music, and:<blockquote>it is exactly [that] kind of violin playing which you need in order to play Beethoven's music &hellip; It means producing a certain singing <i>tone</i>. It's like the <i>bel canto</i> technique in singing. And, like a singer, you have to rehearse this every day. Every day. (www.schillerinstitute.org)</blockquote>As time progressed, the Beethoven quartets became increasingly important to the group and it was while re-recording those works in 1987 that Peter Schidlof died of a heart attack. Because of the personal and musical relationships that had developed over the previous forty years, the remaining members of the quartet felt that it would no longer be possible to continue as a unit without him. It was agreed, therefore, that they should pursue independent careers and that they should disseminate their performance style by teaching and giving masterclasses. Brainin was particularly sought after as a teacher and was affiliated to the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik in Cologne and the Royal Academy of Music in London from 1976 and 1986 respectively.<br>
<br>Brainin's performance style was that of a musical literalist, who looked to <i>Urtext</i> scores as the basis for his interpretations. He argued vigorously against the use of poor editions and was a particularly strong advocate of consistency in performance. He was a musician whose roots were planted firmly in the fertile artistic soil of central Europe, and his performance aesthetic had much in common with that of other musical giants from that tradition. Nevertheless, he was a cosmopolitan musician who maintained that his playing was not the product of a single method but the synthesis of the Russian and Viennese schools: the Russian through Flesch and the Viennese through his experiences as a boy in Vienna. During his career he played on at least two instruments made by distinguished Cremonese makers: the first was a violin made by Pietro Guarneri, which was bought for him by the founders of Dartington Hall, Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst, in 1947, and the second was the Stradivarius of 1713 known as the Gibson, which he bought in 1988.<br>
<br>From the 1980s Brainin became particularly interested in pitch. He argued that A=440 Hz, the pitch used commonly in Britain and elsewhere, was harmful to singers and inappropriate for performing music from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He advocated the widespread adoption of A=432 Hz, a pitch that he felt made early music both fuller and more transparent and vocal music less hazardous to perform. Brainin was not the first musician to address this thorny question: Sir Henry Wood had also challenged existing trends when he adopted French pitch for the Promenade Concerts in London in 1895, a drop of approximately a semitone from that used normally in Britain at that time. But unlike Wood, Brainin was keen to pursue his argument scientifically, and in tests supervised by Bruno Barosi of the International Institute of Violinmaking at Cremona in Italy, he tuned a number of Stradivarius's instruments to the lower pitch and played the same work under the same conditions. As the instruments responded by resonating more fully at A=432 Hz, Brainin felt that his thesis had merit and that further investigations into this fundamental aspect of performance practice were essential.<br>
<br>A large man with a large appetite for life, Brainin was known both for his wit and for his absent-minded behaviour. He was admired greatly for his musical honesty and his devotion to his art. At the time of his death he was involved with the establishment of the Norbert Brainin Foundation at Asolo in Italy, which he hoped would have both a pedagogic and an archival role. He was appointed OBE in 1960 and received honorary degrees from institutions in Britain and abroad. He died of cancer of the colon at Northwick Park Hospital, Brent, London, on 10 April 2005. He was survived by his wife, Kathe, and their daughter, Anne.<br>
