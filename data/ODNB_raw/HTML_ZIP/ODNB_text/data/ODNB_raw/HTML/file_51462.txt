<span class="headword">Macintyre,  John</span>  (1857&#150;1928), <span class="occ">laryngological surgeon and radiologist</span>, was born on 2 October 1857 in the slum area of 343 High Street, Glasgow. His father, Donald Macintyre, had migrated from his native Argyll to Glasgow in search of work, and became a journeyman tailor there. His mother, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Livingston, was a relative of David Livingstone. Macintyre had a somewhat heavy build, humorous but sententious speech, grey-hazel eyes, and dark brown hair which marked him as a Celt of highland origin. After a brief school attendance curtailed by ill health, he was self-educated. Macintyre later obtained a job as temporary electrician at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and graduated MB, CM from Glasgow University in 1882. He was then engaged as a ship's surgeon, and gained postgraduate experience in London, Paris, and Vienna, before returning to Glasgow as assistant surgeon to the Lock Hospital.<br>
<br>During 1885 Macintyre returned to the infirmary as full-time medical electrician and set out to equip the hospital with electrical current for medical and surgical purposes. In the same year he obtained positions at the two extramural schools of medicine attached to the infirmary: dispensary surgeon at Anderson's College and demonstrator of anatomy at the infirmary school of medicine. He later became professor of surgery at Anderson's. In 1886 he was appointed assistant surgeon in the throat department of the infirmary. He developed a large consulting practice in Glasgow, from 1891 in his rooms at 179 Bath Street. Many of Macintyre's patients and visitors were famous actors, singers, or musicians. He owned a very early phonograph and liked to collect recordings of his callers. He had become council member of the British Laryngological and Rhinological Association in 1889, and vice-president in 1890. In 1891 he became co-editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Laryngology</span> (and later joint proprietor and chief editor). Macintyre became president of the association in 1893 and was appointed surgeon in charge of the infirmary's ear, nose, and throat department. He always considered himself to be an ear, nose, and throat surgeon with an interest in X-rays, and only forty-five of his 111 published papers were on X-rays. However, in 1887 he had overseen the establishment of a separate electrical department in the infirmary, which included equipment built and donated by the aristocratic technologist Lord Blythswood.<br>
<br>The medical uses of electricity, which was initially used only for the illumination of body cavities, had by 1887 expanded to include therapeutic applications. The professional corollary was the evolution of the post of hospital medical electrician from that of a mere technician to one suitable for a trained clinician with a scientific bent. The further expansion of the electrical department in 1894 meant that the hospital was in a unique position to exploit the discovery of X-rays by R&ouml;ntgen in November 1895. Clinicians who were also medical electricians were one of the conduits through which the new X-ray technology first entered hospitals and became used in diagnosis and therapy.<br>
<br>R&ouml;ntgen had pre-circulated details of his experiments to international scientists, including Kelvin in Glasgow. Kelvin passed the paper to his nephew, J. T. Bottomley, of the Glasgow University Physical Laboratory, who, in turn, passed it on to his fellow members of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, Lord Blythswood and Macintyre. These men began experimenting with X-rays. The Glasgow group benefited from the input of a range of expertise and assistance, which, as well as Macintyre's experience, included Kelvin's electrical equipment and knowledge, Blythswood's technical knowledge of machines, and the co-operation of local electrical and manufacturing firms. Macintyre persuaded the infirmary managers to further expand his electrical department and to include an X-ray unit in February 1896. Macintyre moved his experiments from Bath Street to the hospital. This was the first such unit in any British hospital, and, perhaps, in the world. A. A. C. Swinton claimed to have produced the first X-ray of a human hand in Britain on 13 January 1896; on 5 February Macintyre, Blythswood, and Bottomley gave a paper and demonstration on the new rays to the Philosophical Society entitled &#145;On the R&ouml;ntgen rays, or, The new photography&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow</span>, 27, 1896, 156&#150;64). Here both R&ouml;ntgen's original images and the Glasgow group's repetitions were shown depicting the frog and the human hand, forearm, and skull. During 1896 Macintyre published eighteen papers on technical developments in X-ray photography; he produced the first instantaneous X-ray (with the fluorescent screen cryptoscope which he believed would ultimately replace photographs); the first X-ray of a renal stone; of the spine; of the interior of the cranium; the heart, lung, and contents of the middle intestine; and of a foreign body in the oesophagus.<br>
<br>In March 1896 R&ouml;ntgen wrote to Macintyre for details of his technique for X-raying soft tissues. Macintyre's greatest technical achievement came in the second half of 1896 when his advances in reducing exposure time allowed him to produce the first X-ray cinematograph of a frog's legs, which paved the way for later developments in radiography. The number of referrals to the infirmary X-ray unit he received was so large that the managers were again approached to build an extension, and the new electrical pavilion was opened in 1902. Reflecting the growing status of the medical use of electricity, Macintyre had been appointed consulting electrician to the infirmary in 1900. He was quick to realize the potential harmful effects of exposure and insisted early on protection for himself and his staff. By the end of the nineteenth century he was using X-rays therapeutically on tumours, and his first published paper on this was in 1902, &#145;Recent electro-therapeutic work in medicine and surgery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Glasgow</span>, 4, 1901&#150;3, 131&#150;52).<br>
<br>Macintyre was elected president of the British Laryngological and Rhinological Association for a second time in 1900, and in 1901 he became president of the R&ouml;ntgen Society. In 1915 he was made a knight of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem, and was elected to the fellowship of the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1918. He married Agnes Jean (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1926), the daughter of H. R. Hardie, in 1892. They had two children: one became a radiologist and served on the Glasgow Royal Infirmary staff. Macintyre died at his home, 179 Bath Street, Glasgow, on 29 October 1928 after suffering from chronic blood poisoning for some months.<br>
