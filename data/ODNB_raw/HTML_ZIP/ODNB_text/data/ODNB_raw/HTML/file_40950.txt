<span class="headword">Davidson,  Thomas</span>  (1840&#150;1900), <span class="occ">philosopher and adult educationist</span>, was born on 25 October 1840 in Old Deer, Aberdeenshire, the elder child of the unmarried Mary Warrender, a farm labourer, and Thomas Davidson, a farmer. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38725/', "John Morrison Davidson")</script>, journalist and radical, was born in 1843. When his grandfather died, his grandmother, by now widowed mother, and aunt moved to the nearby village of Fetterangus. Despite the poverty of his family, after attending the village school in Fetterangus Davidson won a scholarship to King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated in 1860. He then taught at Aberdeen grammar school and later in Tunbridge Wells. He remained an orthodox Christian until early manhood, when he flirted successively with German idealism, Comtean positivism, and a secular republicanism. In 1861 he became engaged to Maye McCombie, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17394/', "William McCombie (1809&#150;1870)")</script>, founder and editor of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Daily Free Press</span>. When he denied the divinity of Christ, however, her family became unhappy about the proposed marriage. He yielded a bit, but when the dispute flared up again in 1865, he emigrated and taught briefly in Toronto before settling in the United States. He never married, but corresponded with Maye McCombie until her death in 1873.<br>
<br>Davidson had an excellent command of Greek and Latin, and was at home in Arabic, Hebrew, and Sanskrit. He could converse in most modern European languages, and had a photographic memory. He was a kind and modest man, who kept every letter and document sent to him by others, but would lend his manuscripts to people without bothering much if they were not returned. In the United States, his learning found an initial home among the transcendentalists and radicals of Boston. Before long, however, he moved to St Louis, where he taught classical languages in public secondary schools. Although he joined the St Louis Hegelians, writing in the <span class="italic">Journal of Speculative Philosophy</span> and translating works by German idealists, he was an Aristotelian with limited sympathy for their views. After eight years in St Louis, he went to live in Greece, and, from 1878 to 1883, in Italy, where he had a private audience with Pope Leo XIII. Reading Aristotle had convinced him there was a faculty above reason, expressed in religion. His youth had shown him the protestant church did not embody this faculty, so now he looked for it in the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. Although neither offered what he wanted, he found a pure spiritual community at the Rosminian monastery in Domodossola, Italy. He lived there for eighteen months, writing <span class="italic">The Philosophical System of Antonio Rosmini-Serbati</span> (1882).<br>
<br>The key features of Davidson's philosophy remained fairly stable. He believed that the divine is immanent in humanity, the telos of the individual is perfection, and the way to perfection is a democratic society and an appropriate education. Later in life, he wrote a series of books outlining his ideal of a popular, democratic education designed to develop the whole self. More immediately, however, he wanted to develop a spiritual philosophy akin to Rosmini's, and embedded in an organization akin to the monastery at Domodossola, but free from Catholic dogma. In 1883 he moved to London to help his disciples form the Fellowship of the New Life. The fellowship set out to cultivate a perfect character in all by subordinating the material to the spiritual and by recognizing the communal nature of our being. Its more specific commitments emphasized the simple life and manual labour. Soon, however, the fellowship split in two, with the New Life constructing a socialist ethic on the foundation of Davidson's spiritual and ethical beliefs, and the Fabian Society turning to social and political matters. Although Davidson always opposed socialism as too material, he was a keen supporter of a more moral economy. He returned to the United States in 1884.<br>
<br>Although Davidson formed an American branch of the New Life, and thereby played an important role in the ethical culture movement, the main organizations he established in America were educational ones. He began to host summer schools in the cultural sciences at his Glenmore retreat in the Adirondack Mountains. Famous philosophers such as John Dewey, William Harris, William James, and Josiah Royce discoursed here with visitors from the Educational Alliance, or Breadwinners' College, that Davidson started on the lower east side of New York city, a slum populated by Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. This college was his greatest achievement, and one of the best examples of adult education in the history of the United States. It did much to transform a community, helping many second-generation immigrants become lawyers, teachers, and philosophers. One of its alumni recalled that when Davidson gave his first lecture, it was &#145;as if from nowhere a Moses appeared&#146;  (Kovar, 6). From those he taught and inspired Davidson took a love that made his final years happy ones. He died a year after an operation for appendicitis, in the General Hospital, Montreal, Canada, on 14 September 1900.<br>
