<span class="headword">Skinner,  Thomas Bridges Boucher</span>  (1804&#150;1877), <span class="occ">army officer and engineer</span>, born at St John's, Newfoundland, on 22 May 1804, was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel William Thomas Skinner (<i>d</i>. 1829), of the Royal Artillery, and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Dr Monier of the Royal Artillery. From 1811 Thomas was at school in England, until in 1818 he went to Ceylon, and obtained a second lieutenancy in the Ceylon Rifles. In 1820 he was employed in road construction. In 1825 he was appointed staff officer of the garrison of Colombo, and on 27 November 1829 deputy assistant quartermaster-general of the forces in Ceylon. In 1832 he opened a road from Arippu, on the western coast of Ceylon, to Anuradhapura. In the following year the public works were transferred to the civil authorities, and Skinner accompanied the surveyor-general over the country to initiate him in his duties. Subsequently Skinner undertook a survey of the mountain zone, the result of which was embodied in a one-inch sketch map of the Kandian provinces and in a general map of Ceylon. In 1836 he was promoted captain, and in the following year was employed to regulate the surveyor-general and civil engineer's department, which had fallen into great confusion. This occupied him until 1840; but as the department became again disorganized when he ceased directing it, he was appointed permanent commissioner for the roads in Ceylon in 1841. He married Georgina, daughter of Lieutenant-General George Burrell CB, on 19 December 1838. One of their children was Monier Williams Skinner, lieutenant-colonel, Royal Engineers. In 1847 he retired from his regiment with the rank of major, and in 1850 the civil engineer's department was amalgamated with his own. In 1859 he was appointed auditor-general, but because of a disagreement with the governor, Sir Henry Ward, on the coast of a railway from Colombo to Kandy, he was superseded in 1861, and returned to his former post of commissioner of public works, which he continued to hold until, in 1865, he resumed the duties of auditor-general.<br>
<br>Skinner retired to England in 1867, and was made a CMG on 15 February 1869. He resided at Bath. Skinner wrote an autobiography, <span class="italic">Fifty Years in Ceylon</span>, edited by his daughter Annie Skinner (1891); it contains a history of his branch of the Skinner family. He died at his home, 7 Grosvenor Place, Bath, on 24 July 1877. His services to Ceylon were very great in opening up the country and rendering overland transport possible.<br>
