<span class="headword">Osborne,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704?, <em>d.</em> 1767), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was the son of the London bookseller Thomas Osborne (<i>d</i>. 1744), who had established a bookselling business in Gray's Inn; he was probably the Thomas Osborne baptized in St Andrew, Holborn, London, on 13 April 1704 to Thomas and Brilliana Osborne. He was admitted as a freeman of the Stationers' Company by patrimony on 2 July 1728 and was made a liveryman four days later. In June 1738 he bought the lease from Mary Gooding of the ground chambers, 1 and 2 Page's Buildings, Field Court, Gray's Inn, and he continued at this location until his death. His father, whose will was proved on 7 March 1744, left his stock and copyright to Thomas, as well as property in London: a house in Fulwood's Rents where Thomas lived; the father also owned other houses and the ferry at Chelsea.<br>
<br>Just what the working relationship was between father and son is not clear, but in 1729 the first of a long series of trade catalogues was issued, presumably a practice begun by the younger Osborne. In 1854 Thomas Thorpe, the bookseller, offered for sale a collection of Osborne's catalogues from 1729 to 1768 in fifty-three volumes octavo. Only a fraction of the numerous catalogues issued by Osborne have survived, but it is evident that he purchased the libraries of the most eminent persons of the time.<br>
<br>The most important collection that Osborne purchased and then issued a catalogue for was the Harleian Library, the sale of which provides valuable insights into his business practices. Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, chancellor of the exchequer, then lord treasurer, and head of the tory ministry under Queen Anne, and his son Edward Harley, the second earl, were among the greatest of English collectors of books and manuscripts. The Harleian books were sold after the death of the second earl in 1741 for &pound;13,000 to Osborne, who engaged Samuel Johnson and William Oldys, literary secretary to the earl from 1738 to 1741, to prepare a catalogue of the books to attract possible purchasers. Proposals for printing the first two volumes of the catalogue by subscription, dated 1 November 1742, were written by Johnson and his &#145;Account of the Harleian Library&#146; also prefaced the first volume of the catalogue, published with the second volume on 28 February 1743 to puff the library. The first two volumes of the catalogue were sold by subscription for 10<i>s</i>., half at the time of subscribing and half on the delivery of the two volumes. Osborne apparently anticipated that his marketing strategy for the library would create controversy; Johnson's &#145;Account&#146;, while giving a broad overview of the collection, is in large measure an apology for selling the catalogue. The haste with which Osborne had forced Johnson and Oldys to compile the catalogue meant that it was poorly organized in places and that many of the books did not receive commentary. Osborne attempted to forestall criticism by having Johnson write a notice for the beginning of the second volume admitting the shortcomings and promising a better performance in the future, a promise that would not be kept. These arguments were not accepted by everyone, and when issuing the third and fourth volumes of the catalogue on 4 January 1744 Osborne found it necessary to turn to Johnson again for a preface with further justification, not only for the price asked for the catalogue but for the prices of the books themselves. By this time the clamour was so loud that Osborne was forced to announce in the preface that he would either credit the price of the catalogue against the purchase of any of the books, or else refund it. At the same time it was announced that the annotations in the third and fourth volumes had been greatly reduced. A fifth volume of the catalogue appeared on 8 April 1745 but was &#145;nothing more than a catalogue of Osborne's old stock&#146;  (Hawkins, 133).<br>
<br>One reason for the reduced annotations in volumes 3 and 4 of the catalogue is that Johnson and Oldys were now involved in another scheme to help Osborne recoup his investment in the Harleian Library: selecting pamphlets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, largely on political and religious subjects, and annotating them for the <span class="italic">Harleian Miscellany</span>, which appeared in eight quarto volumes (1744&#150;6). Again, Osborne asked Johnson to assist him by writing the proposals for printing the work by subscription and contributing an introduction on the importance of small tracts and fugitive pieces to the first number published 24 March 1744.<br>
<br>About this time Osborne and Johnson had a confrontation. Sir John Hawkins, who knew Johnson at the time, recounts that Osborne was a sharp businessman, determined to get all of the work he could out of his employees, and ignorant of what scholarship entails. Johnson was poring over one of the pamphlets to decide whether it should be reprinted in the <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> when Osborne began to abuse him roughly for wasting time:<blockquote>Johnson's anger at so foul a charge was not so great as to make him forget that he had a weapon at hand: he seized a folio that lay near him, and with it felled his adversary to the ground, with some exclamation, which, as it is differently related, I will not venture to repeat. (Hawkins, 150)</blockquote>The altercation made such an impression on Johnson that he told the story, with slight variations, to several people including James Boswell and Hester Lynch Thrale. Johnson also remembered Osborne in his life of Alexander Pope, as &#145;a man entirely destitute of shame, without sense of any disgrace but that of poverty&#146;. The shafts of Pope's satire were directed in vain against Osborne as they were &#145;deadened by his impassive dullness&#146;  (Johnson, 187). Pope had complained that Osborne had pretended to sell the subscription copies of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> at half price when in fact he had cut down the common folio copies to the size of the subscription quartos. As a result, when a revised version of <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> appeared in 1743, Pope substituted Osborne's name for that of Samuel Chapman in the urinating contest with Edmund Curll in book 2.<br>
<br>Osborne's name appears in numerous imprints. <span class="italic">The British Librarian</span>, by Oldys, was published from January to June 1737 by Osborne. He was also involved in the publication of such large works as Robert James's <span class="italic">Medicinal Dictionary</span> (1743&#150;5) and Richard Rolt's <span class="italic">A New Dictionary of Trade and Commerce</span> (1756). Between March 1754 and November 1763 he was active as a member of the Stationers' Company's court of assistants. But Osborne is primarily remembered for his great success in selling libraries. A &#145;catalogist&#146;, Nichols says, is one who &#145;distributes their Books at fixed prices, for ready money&#146;; he continues:<blockquote>Among these Catalogists stands foremost Tom Osborne, who filled one side of Gray's-inn with his lumber, and, without knowing the intrinsic value of a single book, contrived such arbitrary prices as raised him to a country house and dog-and-duck huntings. (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.625)</blockquote>Osborne was short and thick in stature, and generally spoke in a domineering manner to inferiors.<blockquote>In the latter part of his life his manners were considerably softened, particularly to the young booksellers who had occasion to frequent his shop in pursuit of their orders. If they were so fortunate as to call whilst he was taking wine after dinner, they were regularly called into the little parlour in Gray's Inn to take a glass with him. &#145;Young man,&#146; he would say, &#145;I have been in business more than forty years, and am now worth more than 40,000<i>l</i>. Attend to your business, and you will be as rich as I am.&#146; (Timperley, 716)</blockquote>However, to assess Osborne's character properly is difficult. His undoubted success as a bookseller provoked an adverse reaction from other members of the trade who were eager to see his power and influence diminished. Most of the negative comments that have survived can be traced to Pope and Johnson. To be singled out by Pope is no distinction as the list of his satiric victims is extensive, while Johnson, whose lack of social skills is well documented, is a strange source for Osborne's failures in this regard although Boswell, Hawkins, Nichols, Piozzi, and other early biographers, William Cooke and William Shaw, all took their information from him. But Osborne was the bookseller for the Revd A. M. Toplady, who described him as a respectable man; Dibdin calls him &#145;the most celebrated bookseller of his day&#146;, and Timperley &#145;a bookseller of great eminence&#146; (Dibdin, 334; Timperley, 716).<br>
<br>Osborne died on 21 August 1767, and was buried at St Mary's, Islington. His will was made on 8 July and proved on 26 August 1767. His estate was divided among his widow, Mary, his brother-in-law William Smith, and his nephew, William Toll. His stock was sold in 1768&#150;9. The London booksellers John Osborne (<i>c</i>.1688&#150;1734) of Lombard Street and then of The Ship, Paternoster Row, in partnership with Thomas Longman were apparently not related to the Thomas Osbornes; nor, apparently, were John Osborn (<i>d</i>. 1745) and his son John Osborn (<i>c</i>.1714&#150;1775) of St Saviour's Dock and then (from 1733) of the Golden Ball, Paternoster Row.<br>
