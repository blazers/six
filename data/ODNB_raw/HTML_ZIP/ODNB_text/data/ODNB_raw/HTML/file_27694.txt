<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tremellius,  (Joannes) Immanuel</span>  (1510&#150;1580), <span class="occ">Hebrew and biblical scholar</span>, was born in Ferrara, Italy, in 1510. His parents were Jews, and he had at least one brother. In Ferrara he received a traditional Jewish education as well as a humanist training in Latin and Greek, and, when he was twenty, proceeded to the University of Padua. There he met Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (the future Pope Paul III), who had him to stay in Rome and visited his father's house in Ferrara. In Padua too he made the acquaintance of Cardinal Reginald Pole and his circle, and was attracted by their beliefs which have come to be known as evangelism. Although Pole remained loyal to the papacy, he and his friends had marked sympathies with the doctrine of justification by faith which had been propagated by Luther. To this seemingly conciliatory form of Catholicism Tremellius converted. He was baptized in Pole's house in Padua in 1540, with Pole himself as his godfather.<br>
<br>The man who was to play the most important part in Tremellius's life was not Pole but a member of his circle, Pietro Martire Vermigli (Peter Martyr), to whom Tremellius may have given Hebrew lessons in Padua. In the summer of 1541 Vermigli, who had in the meantime become prior of the Augustinian canons in Lucca, invited Tremellius to join him and teach Hebrew at the monastic school he had just reorganized. In the society of Vermigli and a number of other distinguished citizens of Lucca, Tremellius moved steadily closer to protestantism. He also issued his first scholarly work, the <span class="italic">Meditamenta</span>, published in Wittenberg in 1541. In August 1542, after Pope Paul III had introduced the inquisition, Vermigli fled. He subsequently accepted the hospitality of the reformer Martin Bucer in Strasbourg and was soon joined by Tremellius. At this point both men had converted to Reformed protestantism, to which Tremellius was to remain uncompromisingly loyal until his death.<br>
<br>Later Tremellius looked back on his first Strasbourg years as one of the happiest times of his life. He taught Hebrew grammar at the high school founded by Jacob Sturm, with Vermigli as his colleague for <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> history. After the traditional trial period of one year he received a permanent appointment. He also met some of the leading reformers. He remained devoted to Bucer, and in the summer of 1543 was introduced to Calvin and Guillaume Farel, two more men who were to be his friends for the rest of their lives. In October 1544 he married a member of the French community, Elisabeth de Grimecieux, a widow from Metz. She already had one daughter from her marriage with Grimecieux, and with Tremellius she was to have a further daughter and a son.<br>
<br>In April 1547 the situation in Strasbourg started to change with the defeat of the protestant forces, the Schmalkaldic League, by the emperor, Charles V. It now appeared that Catholicism might be reimposed in Germany, and Tremellius again looked for a job elsewhere. Backed by Calvin and Farel, he sought employment in Switzerland in November 1547, but could find nothing. Shortly after, however, Tremellius, like Vermigli, received an invitation to England from the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer. Before the year was out they were both staying with their respective families at Lambeth Palace in Surrey.<br>
<br>Tremellius's memories of his stay with Cranmer were just as fond as those of Strasbourg. In April 1549 he was joined by two other refugees from Strasbourg, Bucer and the Hebraist Paul Fagius, and he described the archbishop's court as &#145;a school, or an arena, of piety and learning&#146;  (Tremellius, 6). There he started to write his commentary on the book of <span class="roman">Hosea</span> (which he would complete and publish many years later). But his main ambition was an academic post. Late in 1549, while Vermigli was sent to Oxford and created regius professor of divinity, Tremellius, with Bucer and Fagius, was dispatched to Cambridge. He succeeded Fagius as &#145;king's reader of Hebrew&#146; after Fagius's death on 13 November.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Tremellius made the acquaintance of Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, and developed a lifelong friendship with her two tutors, Matthew Parker, to whose third son he acted as godfather, and her French tutor, a protestant immigrant from Normandy, Anthony Chevallier. Chevallier, who married Elisabeth de Grimecieux, Tremellius's stepdaughter, on 1 December 1550, started on his own distinguished career as a teacher of Hebrew by assisting his father-in-law in his lectures. Tremellius taught with enthusiasm, prepared even to provide tuition free of charge, and it was while he was at Cambridge that he translated the Geneva catechism into Hebrew in the hope of converting other Jews to Christianity. On 24 October 1552 he was granted a prebend in the diocese of Carlisle.<br>
<br>The accession of Queen Mary in July 1553 put an end to the aspirations of Tremellius and his fellow refugees in England. Together with his family, which now included Anthony Chevallier, Tremellius returned to the continent. He stopped in Brussels, hoping to enlist the support of his former protector and godfather Reginald Pole, but the cardinal had no time for apostates. Again like Vermigli, Tremellius returned to Strasbourg. Here, however, the confessional circumstances had altered. Lutheranism was strong, and acceptance of the Augsburg confession a condition for an academic post. Tremellius refused. He then fell back on the support of Calvin, but discovered once more how strong opposition to Calvin and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s could be. Having failed to keep a post in Bern or even to obtain one in Lausanne (where he also had the backing of Beza and Viret), Tremellius repaired to Geneva in September 1554 to stay with Calvin. He there received an offer of employment: at the suggestion of his councillor, the jurist Ulrich Sitzinger, the Count Palatine Wolfgang, duke of Zweibr&uuml;cken, invited him to Germany to act as tutor to his children. Tremellius reached Zweibr&uuml;cken in November 1554.<br>
<br>The duke, an admirer of Melanchthon, soon regarded Tremellius as indispensable. He refused to let him go when Calvin tried to appoint him professor of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> at the newly founded academy of Geneva, and in December 1558 dispatched him to Hornbach in the hope of turning the former convent school into a high school resembling Sturm's foundation in Strasbourg. Despite his dissatisfaction with the job, Tremellius remained headmaster until 7 March 1561. Shortly before his departure, in January he was sent to Orl&eacute;ans to take part in negotiations concerning the rights of the Huguenots in Metz.<br>
<br>On 4 March 1561 Tremellius had received a summons from the Calvinist elector palatine Frederick III to the University of Heidelberg. First he was entrusted with another mission to France, and it was not until the summer that he could start working at the university. He matriculated on 23 June 1561 after receiving a doctorate in divinity, and was enrolled a member of the academic senate on 9 July. His career at Heidelberg was glorious. He was twice rector; his lectures on Hebrew were enthusiastically attended (his pupils included the French scholar Philippe du Plessis Mornay); and he at last had time to devote himself to scholarship. In 1562 he edited Bucer's lectures which he had heard and copied out in England. In 1563 he published the commentary on <span class="roman">Hosea</span> he had started in England. After spending six months with Matthew Parker, now archbishop of Canterbury, in London in 1565, when the University of Heidelberg was closed on account of the plague, he returned to the Palatinate to publish his Latin translation of the <span class="roman">Targum Jonathan</span> on the twelve minor prophets in 1567. This was followed in 1569 by an Aramaic and Syriac grammar, in which he made an important distinction between the two languages, and a literal Latin translation and edition of the Syriac <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (the second to appear in the sixteenth century), dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. Because of the lack of Syriac types in the workshop of the printer Henri &Eacute;tienne, however, both the grammar and the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> were published in Hebrew characters. Then, with the support of the elector palatine, Tremellius embarked on his major project of translating the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> into Latin, a task which he undertook together with a scholarly Reformed minister of French origin, Fran&ccedil;ois du Jon (Franciscus Junius the elder). Junius's contribution was mainly limited to the translation of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>.<br>
<br>The work was finally published in Frankfurt in five volumes between 1575 and 1579. It was an important addition to the study of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. As the Italian Hebraist Sanctes Pagninus had done before him, Tremellius, in his efforts to produce a Latin translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> superior to the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>, frequently relied on rabbinic interpretations of difficult words and passages. In doing so he improved on the work of his predecessors and the result of his labours, much admired in the protestant world and even sanctioned, albeit with alterations, at the Catholic universities of Douai and Louvain, had a considerable influence on the English Authorized Version of 1611.<br>
<br>On 5 December 1577 Tremellius relinquished his chair in Heidelberg. Frederick III had died on 26 October 1576. His successor, Louis VI, was a Lutheran who gradually ousted his father's Reformed prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. Tremellius thus welcomed a call to act as professor of Hebrew at the academy of Sedan, recently founded by Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, duke of Bouillon. Sedan was to have one of the finest schools of oriental languages in Reformed Europe, and Tremellius did much to contribute to its prestige. He died in Sedan on 9 October 1580.<br>
