<span class="headword">Stewart,  Allan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Allan Breck Stewart]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1745&#150;1752), <span class="occ">Jacobite sympathizer and accused murderer</span>, was the son of Donald Stewart, also known as Vic Ian Vic Allister, sometime of Inverchomrie in Rannoch. He was probably born in Rannoch but was brought up not by his father but at Appin in the household of his kinsman James Stewart of the Glen (<i>b</i>. before 1700, <i>d</i>. 1752). An allegedly dissolute youth ended with his enlistment in George II's army. Having survived the battle of Prestonpans (1745) on the government side, he was a willing prisoner of the Jacobites, for whom he fought at Culloden in the following April. Later that year he escaped to France where he joined Lord Ogilvy's regiment, one of three Scottish regiments in French service. In 1749, 1751, and early 1752 Stewart returned to Edinburgh and Rannoch as a courier for the rents of his kinsman Stewart of Ardsheil and as a recruiter to the French service.<br>
<br>On 14 May 1752 Colin Campbell of Glenure, crown factor for the Ardsheil estate, was murdered by a gunman as he returned home from Fort William. Suspicion immediately fell on Allan Stewart. Warrants were issued for his arrest (with a reward of &pound;100), though he was never apprehended and was eventually tried <i>in absentia</i>. That trial resulted in the conviction of Stewart's former guardian, James of the Glen, as an accessory in what has become known as the infamous Appin murder, for which James was executed in November. Allan Stewart's culpability in Glenure's assassination&#151;his desire to be &#145;fitsides&#146; with the victim&#151;was acknowledged even by his friends, as was his concern to know of Glenure's whereabouts before the murder and his presence in the area at the time of the shooting. Against this it has been suggested that his &#145;in-kneed&#146; gait in flight would have betrayed his identity to the surviving eyewitness, Mungo Campbell.<br>
<br>Stewart's status as a deserter from the British army may account for his immediate flight following the murder. He was reported to have returned to France, where he may have been the officer listed in Bouillon's regiment in 1757 who was pensioned as a second captain in 1763. This Allan Stewart then enlisted in the Lyonnais regiment, which he left in 1777, receiving the military medal cross. Alexander Campbell, younger of Ardchattan, great-nephew of Glenure, met a man claiming to be Allan Breck Stewart in Paris in 1787. A friend of Walter Scott supposedly met Stewart in Paris around 1789, clad as a Benedictine, although there is no record of an Allan Stewart among the English or Scots Benedictines in France at that time. Scott wrote up the incident in the notes to <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span> (1817), arguably heavily embroidering it and presenting Stewart as an elderly nostalgic exile. Stewart could have been the &#145;Stuart d'Artoury (allan)&#146; listed in a book of French military pensioners in 1790. Stewart's reputation endures through the fictional account of his actions, as Alan Breck, in Robert Louis Stevenson's <span class="italic">Kidnapped</span> (1886). The fictional Alan resembles his namesake in the pockmarked complexion which gave him the Gaelic description &#145;breck&#146; (at least two other Appin contemporaries had the same style) and in a vanity of dress (his French uniform) beyond the quality of his clothes, which were &#145;shabby with an inclination to be genteel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span>, 28 May 1752) or what Stevenson described as &#145;costly clothes, though somewhat soiled with &hellip; being slept in&#146;. But where Stevenson's Breck is &#145;smallish in stature, but well set&#146;, and indeed has something of the sprite about him, Allan Stewart was &#145;tall&#146; at &#145;about 5 feet ten&#146; and &#145;a little in-kneed&#146;.<br>
<br>Stevenson's <span class="italic">Kidnapped</span> draws on the tradition in which the murder and the injustices of James Stewart's trial and execution have been romanticized in terms of both an atavistic Campbell&#150;Stewart clan animosity and of the post-Jacobite pacification of the highlands, a tradition which has assigned to James Stewart the role of sacrificial victim without condemning his more closely implicated kinsman. An excellent and informed corrective was set out by Sir James Fergusson in his essay &#145;The Appin murder case&#146; in the <span class="italic">Scottish Historical Review</span> for 1952. Fergusson relieves Glenure of his reputation as an oppressor of Jacobite tenants, while aspects of James Stewart's trial which have fed the traditional emotive picture are shown to be less sinister. What is demonstrated is the alarm which the Appin murder provoked among a Westminster administration by no means confident of its dealings with Scotland.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Kidnapped</span>'s charismatic but significantly childlike protagonist made Alan Breck an enduring fictional creation. Stevenson's portrayal, like Scott's cameo in <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span> before it, was informed by a depiction of Jacobitism as the Parthian response of a decaying highland culture; the future lies with David Balfour. Though written with less flair, more recent examples of Jacobite historiography, such as G. P. Insh's socio-economic model of Scottish Jacobitism, have secured a perennial shelf-life through the influence of Stevenson's novel. After May 1752 the real-life Allan Breck Stewart disappeared into the exigent, diasporic world from whence he came; arguably, his subsequent fictional reinvention remains as significant and worthy of consideration as its shadowy reality.<br>
