<span class="headword">Holles,  Gervase</span>  (1607&#150;1675), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at White Friars, Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on 9 March 1607, the only surviving son of Freschville Holles (1575&#150;1630) and his wife, Elizabeth (1578&#150;1608), daughter of John Kingston of Grimsby. His education which began at Grimsby grammar school was continued for nearly three years in the household of John Holles, first earl of Clare, who read logic and philosophy to him. After his father forbade him to enlist in Lord Vere's regiment in the Low Countries he entered Middle Temple in November 1628. Shortly after his father's death Holles married on 17 June 1630 Dorothy Kirketon and returned to Grimsby where for four years he was &#145;indulgent to my own contentment&#146; and &#145;took great pleasure in searching the records and investigating antiquities&#146;  (Wood, 228). Holles decided in September 1634 to move to Mansfield and recommence his study of the law but the sudden death of his wife the following January led him to return to Grimsby. After the death of his son George on 10 August 1635 he re-entered the Middle Temple for the Michaelmas term. He was chosen comptroller of the house and made a contribution of &pound;200 to the Christmas festivities. As the mayor of Grimsby in 1636 and 1638 he collected ship money from the town. Holles was elected to represent Grimsby in March and October 1640. On 26 April 1641 he was suspended from the house after he attacked the Scottish proposals for peace &#145;as beyond all proportion&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 207f, fols. 37<i>v</i>&#150;38<i>v</i>). The order was rescinded on 2 December. In January 1642 a Commons committee investigated an incident between Holles and John Ogle in Westminster Hall and concluded that provocation had been given by Holles. After Holles ignored a summons of 18 April to attend the house he was eventually disabled from sitting and on 22 August 1642 a new writ of elections was issued  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2.128, 404, 537, 557, 734).<br>
<br>Holles who had moved to live at Newark in 1640 was appointed to the Nottinghamshire commission of the peace in March 1641. He was among the signatories of a letter in June 1642 to the Nottinghamshire MPs which warned parliament it should not conceive that their votes should be the law. In July he made a modest contribution to the appeal in Nottinghamshire to raise a troop of horse for the king. In the next month Holles was commissioned by the earl of Lindsey as a captain in the regiment of Sir Lewis Dives and when Charles raised his standard he brought 117 men to Nottingham. In September he was appointed sergeant-major of a regiment of foot and fought for the king at Edgehill. Holles was made an honorary MA by the University of Oxford and appointed to the parliament held in the town. In December he was given permission as a colonel to raise a regiment of foot from Lincolnshire which in the next month served at the seizure of Belvoir Castle and at the repulse of an attack on Newark. He joined the earl of Newcastle's troops at the battle of Adwalton Moor and fought at the first battle of Newbury. In February 1644 his regiment which was defending Muskham Bridge at Newark was broken by Meldrum's attack. Charles appointed Holles governor of King's Lynn in April 1644 but the town was and remained in parliamentary control. When Holles applied to compound in December 1645 his fine was set at &pound;738 but it was not paid. After a proposal to raise troops for the doge of Venice failed, he enlisted in the service of the king of France. He returned to England to fight in the second civil war and was captured at the siege of Colchester and imprisoned. After his release in December 1649 Holles went to France but he eventually settled in Rotterdam. His penurious circumstances probably led to his request to compound but he failed to pay a fine of &pound;860. Holles was impatient with the policy of waiting on events and in March 1657 he was reported to the commander of the English troops assembled for an invasion. Holles who lived in expectation of an invitation to go to England prepared a list of Lincolnshire peers and gentry who would support the king but the failure of Booth's rising prevented his return  (BL, Egerton MS 2541, fol. 362<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). In March 1660 Holles was informed that the king thought it was high time he returned to England. He was detained by lack of money and obligation to his landlady who had subsidized him for many years. Holles eventually returned in May 1660 and was in the next month appointed a master of requests. On 8 April 1661 he was elected to represent Grimsby in the House of Commons. Though he did not play an active role in the Commons he was listed among the dependants of the court in 1669 and 1671. Holles had been granted in January 1661 an annuity of &pound;100 but the reward for which he was admirably suited, the keepership of the records in the Tower, eluded him (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.313; <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1673&#150;5</i>, 473). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13551/', "Sir Frescheville Holles")</script>, his son and heir by his second marriage (on 4 October 1637) to Elizabeth Molesworth (<i>d</i>. 1662), was killed in 1672 and this branch of the Holles family ended with Gervase's death in London on 10 February 1675. He was buried on 13 March at Mansfield.<br>
<br>Gervase Holles had originally intended &#145;to make a relation both historical and genealogical concerning Lincolnshire&#146; by collecting many materials out of the records, charters, and church monuments of the shire. It was &#145;the damned and dire rebellion&#146; which robbed him of his leisure and the greater part of his collection. Eight volumes of this collection now survive (BL, Lansdowne MSS 207a&#150;f; Add. MSS 5531, 6118) but though parts of the work were transported to the Netherlands, Holles judged it was impossible to continue with his work on Lincolnshire. He decided to make a discourse of his family which now survives as the <span class="italic">Memorials of the Holles Family</span> (ed. A. C. Wood). The <span class="italic">Memorials</span> are the history of five generations of the Holles family whose position and prosperity were established by Sir William Holles, lord mayor of London in 1540. There are also genealogical accounts of the families with whom the Holleses married. It is the use of information from his contemporaries and his own experiences which, as in his account of John Holles, first earl of Clare, transforms his account from being mere tables of descent into a vivid portrait. It is regrettable that Gervase did not extend the brief account of his early life into the civil wars and their aftermath.<br>
