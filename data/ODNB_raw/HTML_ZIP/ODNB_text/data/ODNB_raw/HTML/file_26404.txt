<span class="headword">Stepney,  George</span>  (1663&#150;1707), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born in Westminster, London, was the son of George Stepney, groom of the chamber to Charles II, and his wife, Mary, the eldest daughter and coheir of Sir Bernard Whetstone, knight, of Woodford, Essex, and the grandson of Sir Thomas Stepney, knight, cupbearer to Charles I. He was descended from the Stepneys of Prendergast in Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>In 1676 Stepney was admitted to Westminster School, where he was a king's scholar. There he met James Montagu and Matthew Prior and developed a close friendship with Charles Montagu, later earl of Halifax, that lasted throughout his life. Having matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1682, he went on to be elected a scholar in 1683, and to receive his BA in 1686, his MA in 1689, and a fellowship in 1689. At Cambridge he acquired a reputation as a poet for his translations of the classics, such as Juvenal, and for his political verses, such as those on the marriage of Princess Anne or on the death of Queen Mary. A persuasive pamphleteer and a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script>, he joined William's side in the revolution of 1688. In 1697 he became a fellow of the Royal Society and was appointed a commissioner of trade and plantations, a position he held until his death.<br>
<br>Stepney's importance, however, rests mainly on his diplomatic service, which began in 1687 and which made him the most well-known career diplomat of William III's reign. With the help of Montagu, he was appointed secretary to Sir Peter Wych at Hamburg. He later served as secretary to James Johnson at Berlin (1691); charg&eacute; d'affaires at Berlin (1692); secretary at Vienna (1693); commissary and deputy to Saxony (1693&#150;4); minister to Hesse-Cassel (1694&#150;5) and Saxony (1695); and envoy-extraordinary to Cologne and Mainz (1695&#150;6), Hesse-Cassel, the Palatinate, and Treves (Trier) (1695&#150;7), Saxony (1698), Prussia (1698&#150;9), and again to the Palatinate (1701).<br>
<br>Because of his extensive service in the Holy Roman empire Stepney had a grasp of German affairs that few could equal. Macky's remark that &#145;no Englishman ever understood the affairs of Germany so well and few Germans better&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 142) reflected Stepney's reputation among his contemporaries. That reputation led to his appointment as envoy-extraordinary (1701&#150;5) and then envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary (1705&#150;6) at Vienna, where he played a crucial role during the early years of the War of the Spanish Succession (1702&#150;14). Stepney had professed himself delighted with the appointment in spite of all the endless drinking and negotiating with German princes, which he jokingly remarked &#145;might make as doleful a chapter as that wherein St. Paul enumerates his Labours and Sufferings&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP, Germany, 105/65, Stepney to Godolphin, Vienna, 10 May 1702). Still he admitted that he would &#145;not quit this post for anything in Europe&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP, Germany, 105/63/214&#150;15, Stepney to Halifax, Vienna, 17 Aug 1701). Stepney's <span class="italic">Essay upon the Present Interest of England</span> (1701), which had contended that England must reduce the &#145;overgrown power&#146; of France and must not allow Louis XIV to delude England into a false sense of security  (Scott, 11.195&#150;218) made him initially popular at court.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, only the allies' mutual fear of and desire to limit Louis XIV's power held the coalition together. Conflicting war aims and strategies eroded the grand alliance and undermined Stepney's position. Leopold I particularly resented the maritime powers' pressure to negotiate with the elector of Bavaria, who had allied with France, and with R&aacute;k&oacute;czi, who led an insurrection against him in Hungary. Austrian mistrust of Stepney largely vitiated his usefulness and ultimately led to his recall. In 1705 he wrote that he was &#145;heartily weary of drudging on in this laborous and ungratefull employment&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP, Germany, 105/75, Stepney to Blathwayt, 1 April 1705). In May 1706 Stepney welcomed the opportunity to take possession of Mindelheim, the lordship recently conferred on Churchill. Stepney needed the reprieve, for by late 1706 his position had so deteriorated that he could remark that he was &#145;very lucky to have escap'd Vienna which is now the most disagreeable Station We have abroad and will become more so every day&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 7075, fol. 59, Stepney to Raby, The Hague, 2 Dec 1706). He arrived on 9 November 1706 at his next post at The Hague, where he served as envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary. In February 1707 he went on a special mission to the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel to renew the treaty on troop deployment.<br>
<br>Stepney received leave to return to England in August of that year, and died, unmarried, at Chelsea of what contemporaries referred to as the &#145;bloody flux&#146; on 26 September 1707. Many regretted his demise. Charles Whitworth, who had served his diplomatic apprenticeship under Stepney, mourned the loss of &#145;a most tender Father &hellip; the best of friends and Masters&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 37355, Whitworth to Stepney's sisters, 30 Nov 1701). In his will Stepney left &pound;50 to Matthew Prior in cancellation of a long-standing debt, a golden cup and a hundred volumes of his library to the earl of Halifax, the remainder to a Mr Lewis, and a silver basin and ewer to Adam Cardonnel. The rest of his estate, the largest part of which was a Treasury debt of over &pound;7000, went to his two sisters. He was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey, where a bust was later erected to his memory. A portrait of him by Kneller survives. Macky described Stepney as &#145;short in stature, with a pleasant Countenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 142). He was a man of wit, humour, and intelligence, whose career underscores the growing importance of a body of capable and dedicated civil servants.<br>
