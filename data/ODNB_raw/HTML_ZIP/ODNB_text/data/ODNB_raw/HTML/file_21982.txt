<span class="headword">Perronet,  Vincent</span>  (1693&#150;1785), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, on 11 December 1693, the third and youngest son of David Perronet (1664&#150;1717), a surgeon, and Philothea Arther, first cousin to the countess dowager of Dartmouth. Perronet was descended from a well-to-do Swiss family. His father had been born in Ch&acirc;teau d'Oex, then in the canton of Bern, and had come to England in 1680, being naturalized on 20 March 1708. A cousin, Jean Rodolphe Perronet (1708&#150;1794), later achieved celebrity in France as the engineer of thirteen bridges, including the Pont de Neuilly and the Pont de la Concorde in Paris.<br>
<br>Vincent Perronet's mother had been brought up by Sir Philip Howard, uncle of the earl of Carlisle. Probably because of her connection with Lord Carlisle, Perronet was educated at St Bees School in Cumberland and the Queen's College, Oxford, from which he matriculated in December 1714 and graduated BA in 1718. On 4 December 1718 he married Charity (1688&#150;1763), daughter of Thomas and Margaret Goodhew, at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London. They had twelve children, the first of whom, Daniel, was baptized at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 2 October 1719. In the same year Perronet was ordained and began a nine-year curacy at Sundridge, in Kent. In 1724 he graduated MA from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Four years later he became the vicar of Shoreham, Kent, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>From childhood onward Perronet experienced terrifying dreams, visions, mystical conflicts, and spiritual distress. He received some comfort from reading John Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>, which ensured that his religious outlook was never divorced from rational thought. He saw in Locke &#145;the most affectionate regard for truth, sound morality and divine revelation&#146;, and defended him first against the Anglican divine Joseph Butler in his <span class="italic">A Vindication of Mr Locke</span> (1736), and then in <span class="italic">A Second Vindication</span> (1738) against the dissenter Isaac Watts.<br>
<br>In 1744 Perronet was introduced to John Wesley by Henry Piers, a friend and fellow clergyman. Perronet, like other members of his family, had initially considered the Methodists a threat to the established church. Though increasingly attracted by Methodism, Perronet refused to embrace the movement before he had received a full statement about its origin and purpose. This Wesley famously set out in a letter of 1748, published as <span class="italic">A Plain Account of the People called Methodists</span> (1749), and thus began Perronet's lifelong friendship with the Wesleys and his support for Methodism through the pulpit and the press.<br>
<br>By the late 1740s the Wesley brothers had been excluded from preaching in many Anglican pulpits. Perronet's decision to allow them to preach in his church went against the wishes of his parishioners, and on the first occasion Charles Wesley spoke he was protected from missiles by Perronet's son Charles (1723&#150;1776). Other members of the Perronet family also supported the Methodists. His eldest daughter, Damaris (<i>d</i>. 1782), became a Methodist class leader and a mainstay of the Shoreham Methodists. Another daughter, Elizabeth, married William Briggs, a class leader and John Wesley's book steward in 1749.<br>
<br>Perronet's connection with Methodism appears to have lessened his interest in philosophy, and his published works between 1745 and 1767 reflect a theology of grace and an advocacy of religious life as exemplified by Methodist teaching. From the beginning of their friendship the Wesleys looked to Perronet for guidance in personal as well as theological matters. He took part in the Methodist conference of 1747 which discussed the difficult subject of the doctrine of entire sanctification. In 1748 he encouraged Charles Wesley in his love for Sarah Gwynne and subsequently became a trustee of their marriage settlement. John Wesley, after his failed pursuit of Grace Murray, consulted him in 1751 about marriage and was advised to marry, though there is no indication that Wesley's disastrous union with Marie Vazeille can be blamed on Perronet.<br>
<br>In January 1770 Perronet was visited by Selina, countess of Huntingdon, who described him as &#145;a most heavenly man, with the most lively piety joined with the profoundest humility&#146;  (Seymour, 1.317). Later that year John Wesley outraged Huntingdon's followers by purging Methodist preaching of an association with Calvinism which, in Wesley's opinion, played down the necessity of holy living. Perronet, appalled as he was at the fury of the Calvinists' personal attacks, nevertheless tried to judge the matter on the truth it proposed, as he had done in his earlier defence of Locke. He distinguished the false belief (often laid at the Methodists' door) that a person could build up merit with God because of his good works from the scriptural command to do them simply as the inevitable concomitant of a Christian life.<blockquote>With regard to the merit of good works &hellip; I could not conceive how an unprofitable servant could merit anything from a holy God. But then &hellip; Christ came to purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works &hellip; though even our best works can have no merit in them. (<span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span>, 253)</blockquote>In later life rheumatism (possibly rheumatoid arthritis) left Perronet painfully disabled. From the end of 1778 he never left his home, though he continued to preach there every Sunday morning. With his wife and ten of his children now dead, Perronet was cared for by his granddaughter Elizabeth (Betsy) Briggs, daughter of Elizabeth. John Wesley continued to visit Perronet, whom in 1783 he found &#145;full of love&#146;. In these years of confinement Perronet pursued his favourite subject, the application of scripture prophecies to the second coming of Christ and to the natural events in which he saw signs of the impending end of the world.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1785 Perronet became ecstatic in contemplation of the glorious happiness to come, and two days later died at the Shoreham vicarage in his sleep. He was buried at Shoreham on 14 May. Betsy, who later married Peard Dickinson, Perronet's curate, wrote a memoir of her grandfather which was published in the <span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span> (1799), interspersed with her husband's reflections on Perronet's character. Dickinson spoke of Perronet's manly piety, Christian courtesy and hospitality, cheerful and sweet disposition, fervour of spirit, simplicity of manners, and frankness and generosity of temper. Those who knew him delighted in this happy, holy man whom Wesley called a &#145;saint&#146;; an anonymous verse among the Perronet manuscripts ends &#145;Men loved in thee the image of their Lord&#146;. Yet as his second son, <a href="#cosubject_21982">Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a>, looked back over his father's life, he also saw an &#145;unwearied toil&#146; with only &#145;minute gains&#146;  (Perronet, 198). Dickinson was similarly of the opinion that &#145;the success, which he ardently wished for, did not follow his labours&#146;  (Briggs and Dickinson, 161), at least in Shoreham. It was his decisive influence on the Wesleys, and therefore on Methodism, which gave Perronet's life historical importance. His reason, affection, and loyalty steered them through difficulties caused by their own characters and by religious opposition.<br>
<br>One of only two children to outlive their father, <a name="cosubject_21982"></a><span class="headword">Edward Perronet</span>  (1721&#150;1792), <span class="occ">Independent minister and hymn writer</span>, was born at Sundridge, Kent. He was educated at Sevenoaks School and entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1741, though he did not graduate. Having joined Charles Wesley in 1746, he endured &#145;rough treatment&#146; at Penkridge, Staffordshire, but continued with him on his tour of the north (1746&#150;7). He married Duriah Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1792) at St Bartholomew-the-Great, London, on 10 September 1748; the couple had no children. Perronet preached with John Wesley in 1749, supported him in his misery after Grace Murray rejected him, and was attacked by critics of Methodists at Bolton. By 1750 difficulties caused by Perronet's independent-mindedness were becoming apparent. He and his brother Charles refused to preach where Wesley requested, although they remained committed to his message.<br>
<br>By then many Methodists who had been refused sacrament by clergy were asking to receive it from their own preachers. To accede implied a separation from the church which the Wesleys were determined to avoid. Nevertheless by 1755 Edward and his brother had administered the sacrament, believing that their calling gave them the right to do so, and that the Wesleys' opposition was a denial of their liberty to act according to their conscience. In 1756 Perronet published <span class="italic">The Mitre</span>, a ferocious attack in verse on the Church of England. The notes to the verse constitute a valuable theological commentary. Perronet claimed that the sacrament of the Lord's supper was not a priestly rite, and that a handful of private individuals, or a single family, could celebrate it as had the early Christians.<br>
<br>The disagreement over <span class="italic">The Mitre</span> further worsened relations with the Wesleys. In November 1756 Charles Wesley wrote of Perronet:<blockquote>I love both him and Charles, and the whole family &hellip; but must we, therefore, suffer this madman to cast firebrands down and to tear our whole flock to pieces? &hellip; at Canterbury I saw our Sacrament Hymns, which Ted has scratched out and blotted, hardly leaving twenty entire lines &hellip; his own soul can never recover while he wanders from house to house in such a lounging way of life. Therefore let him go home to his wife, and do as much good and as little harm as he can at Canterbury. (C. Wesley to J. Wesley, 16 Nov 1756, Tyerman, <span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 2.254)</blockquote>Thus Perronet's connection with organized Methodism came to an end. For a short time he preached in the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion until his open aversion to the established church led to his becoming the minister of an Independent congregation.<br>
<br>Little is known of Perronet in later life, though he is said to have become the editor of a local newspaper in which he censured and ridiculed &#145;those whom he thought enthusiastic supporters of Church and State&#146;  (Smith, 1.209). He published, anonymously, collections of hymns and poems in 1756, 1782, and 1785, of which the last, <span class="italic">Occasional Verses</span>, was the most important. It contains his enduring memorial, the great hymn &#145;On the Resurrection&#146; (&#145;All hail the power of Jesu's name&#146;), which has a place in most English-language hymnbooks; many other poems which reflect the Calvinist&#150;Arminian quarrel also deserve recognition.<br>
<br>Edward Perronet probably separated from his family after the affair of <span class="italic">The Mitre</span>, and apart from &pound;10 for &#145;mourning&#146; for him and Duriah, he was excluded from Vincent Perronet's final will because he had inherited his sister Damaris's property at Wandsworth. The Wesleys continued to think affectionately of their former supporter. &#145;Where is your Uncle Ned?&#146;, Charles asked Betsy Briggs, &#145;I retain all my old love for him and trust he will be given at last to his blessed father's prayers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Rev. Charles Wesley</span>, 2.284). Perronet died at Canterbury on 2 January 1792 and was buried six days later in the south cloister of Canterbury Cathedral.<br>
