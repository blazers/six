<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Malibran,  Maria Felicia</span>  (1808&#150;1836), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born at 3 rue de Cond&eacute;, Paris, on 24 March 1808, the second child of the Spanish tenor Manuel Garc&iacute;a (1775&#150;1832) and his wife, Maria Joaquina Sitch&egrave;s (1780&#150;1854), a singer and actress. Her elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33321/', "Manuel Patricio Garc&#237;a (1805&#150;1906)")</script>, a teacher of singing, founded the English branch of this musical dynasty; her younger sister became the prima donna Pauline Viardot (1821&#150;1910). Owing to her father's profession Maria's childhood was peripatetic, and she moved from Naples and Rome, where her father collaborated with Rossini, to Paris, and then to London, where she made a successful d&eacute;but at the King's Theatre on 11 June 1825, in Rossini's <span class="italic">Il barbiere di Siviglia</span>. She had been trained by her father.<br>
<br>In October 1825 Garc&iacute;a took his family and a few more singers to New York, where they introduced Italian opera to the New World. Maria was the prima donna, performing operas mainly by Rossini. In 1826 in New York she married a naturalized American merchant, Eug&egrave;ne Malibran (1781&#150;1836), twenty-seven years her senior, probably in order to escape from her tyrannical father. In November 1827 she returned to France, alone.<br>
<br>Maria Malibran arrived in Paris just when the political and artistic ideas which were to culminate in the events of 1830 were gathering momentum. Her success was immediate. Her remarkable voice and musicianship, and her typically Romantic style of acting&#151;passionate, frenetic, highly individual&#151;exactly expressed the mood of the moment. In Paris, where she was prima donna at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Italien for the next four years, her influence on the Romantic generation&#151;particularly on writers&#151;was considerable. As Rossini's Desdemona she became a Romantic icon. She also sang frequently in England, where she was acclaimed as an outstanding singer, but did not have the cult status which she soon acquired in France and, later, in Italy.<br>
<br>In 1829 Maria fell in love with the Belgian violinist Charles de B&eacute;riot (1802&#150;1870). She succeeded in obtaining a civil annulment of her marriage in 1835, and married B&eacute;riot on 29 March 1836. From 1832 until her death she sang in Italy and England. In Italy she became the supreme interpreter of Bellini's music, and her final season at La Scala (1835&#150;6) marked the apogee of her career. She spent the summer of 1836 in London, where she was engaged by Alfred Bunn to sing operas&#151;including <span class="italic">Fidelio</span>&#151;in English. On 5 July, while riding in Regent's Park with Lord William Lennox, she had a fall, which affected her health.<br>
<br>In September Maria appeared at the Manchester festival. On leaving the stage after a sensational performance on 14 September she became seriously ill; from then on she was attended by three Manchester doctors. But B&eacute;riot, losing hope, summoned her homoeopathic doctor, Dr Belluomini, from London. He arrived on 18 September, dismissed the Manchester doctors, and refused to consult them. However, she died in her room at the Mosley Arms Hotel on 23 September. The cause of death was unclear. Immediately after his wife's death B&eacute;riot, having given instructions that she should have a simple funeral and that there should be no post-mortem, left Manchester with Dr Belluomini. This created a very unfavourable impression.<br>
<br>The festival committee decided to give La Malibran (as she was known) a grand civic funeral, which took place on 1 October. All the dignitaries of Manchester attended, and thousands of people filed past her grave in the collegiate church (now Manchester Cathedral). However, that afternoon a letter was received from B&eacute;riot in Belgium saying that he now wished his wife to be buried there. Public opinion opposed this; and there was criticism from the medical profession, which considered that a post-mortem should have been held. Homoeopathy was fiercely attacked in the national and medical press.<br>
<br>When the diocesan court (Chester) granted a faculty to B&eacute;riot to disinter his wife's coffin, a group of Mancunians, the Memorialists, lodged a caveat. It was only when Malibran's mother came to Manchester that the Memorialists relented, and the faculty was granted to her. The coffin was exhumed on 20 December, and reburied at Laeken cemetery, Brussels, on 5 January 1837.<br>
<br>Malibran was dark-haired, slight, attractive rather than beautiful; vivacious and amusing, she nevertheless had an aura of melancholy. She was the most charismatic singer of her epoch, and a charming and intelligent woman. Alfred de Musset's <span class="italic">Stances &agrave; la Malibran</span> (1836) was the finest tribute to her.<br>
