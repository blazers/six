<span class="headword">Hinckley,  John</span>  (1617/18&#150;1695), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Coughton (or possibly Chilvers Coton), Warwickshire, the son of Robert Hinckley. Hinckley states that &#145;I was borne of, and educated by religious parents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, sig. t7). Influenced by his schoolmaster, Josiah Packwood, Hinckley was persuaded early on to prepare for the ministry. He later wrote &#145;I came [to Oxford] &hellip; well principled in &hellip; Religion towards God. My dearest friends were accounted Puritanes, in those days&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasciculus literarum</span>, 243). He matriculated at St Alban Hall on 4 July 1634, aged sixteen. He graduated BA on 11 April 1638 and MA on 22 March 1641. A sermon by Peter Wentworth of Balliol College in St Mary's challenged several of his own political and religious assumptions, propelling him into a convinced conformity within the Church of England.<br>
<br>Hinckley was invited by George Purefoy of Wadley, near Faringdon, Berkshire, to serve in his household, perhaps as a teacher. Subscription records indicate Hinckley was ordained priest on 28 May 1643. He was presented as vicar of the nearby parish of Coleshill, Berkshire. On 14 January, probably in 1647, he married Susannah Shelley (<i>c</i>.1621&#150;1671) of Sussex. They had nine children, three of whom&#151;Walter (1648&#150;1699), John (1654&#150;1705), and Henry (1660&#150;1732)&#151;followed their father into the ministry. After the death of his wife on 24 July 1671, Hinckley married Frances Tracy (<i>c</i>.1625&#150;1701) in 1675, their twenty-year marriage ending at his death.<br>
<br>In 1660 Hinckley accepted the rectory of Northfield, Warwickshire. He experienced early success in attracting local nonconformists to his preaching ministry. But after publishing his <span class="italic">Piqanalogia, or, A Persuasive to Conformity by Way of a Letter to the Dissenting Brethren</span> (1670) he became involved in an increasingly rancorous dispute with nonconformists in general and Richard Baxter in particular. Baxter took offence at published remarks which he considered unfair and responded by letter in a series of four private exchanges with Hinckley from August 1670 to February 1672. In 1680 Hinckley undertook to publish the entire correspondence, as well as another letter in which he dismissed Baxter's own published defences of nonconformity as &#145;Canting Gibberish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasciculus literarum</span>, 269). Charging Hinckley with a breach of faith, Baxter published his own defensive response in 1681, <span class="italic">A Third Defense of the Cause of Peace</span>. Both parties claimed victimization by the other, and neither accepted responsibility for the increasingly shrill tone. It was a conflict which served mainly to diminish both men. During the course of this controversy Hinckley was honoured by his colleagues among the clergy and at Oxford. On 15 October 1673 he was made a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral, and on 9 July 1679 the degrees of BD and DD were conferred on him by Oxford University.<br>
<br>Hinckley's last years at Northfield were marred by a bitter conflict with Thomas Jolliffe, lord of the manor at Cofton Hackett. According to Hinckley, in 1690 Jolliffe broke an agreement made twenty years earlier which exempted him from having to pay Jolliffe an annual pension of &pound;7 from the living. Hinckley's indignant account, &#145;The tru stating of something concerning the parsonage of Northfield&#146;, is written on the back pages of the second volume of Northfield parish register. In it Hinckley claims that, following the death of the one witness to their agreement, Jolliffe instigated legal proceedings and unfairly used his influence to procure a judgment against Hinckley in which he was forced to pay &pound;600. Hinckley died at Northfield on 13 April 1695 and was buried on 17 April in the chancel of St Laurence's Church, Northfield.<br>
