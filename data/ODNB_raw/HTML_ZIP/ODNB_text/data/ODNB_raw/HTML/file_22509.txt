<span class="headword">Pontack</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1666&#150;1711), <span class="occ">tavern-keeper</span>, was the original proprietor of Pontack's tavern, or eating-house, an establishment notable for its fine wines and the luxurious dinners provided there. As such it became an important gathering place for the social and political &eacute;lite of post-Restoration London. Little is known about Pontack himself. The presumption that Pontack was a son of Arnaud de Pontac (1599&#150;1681), president of the <i>parlement</i> of Bordeaux, must be dismissed, for Arnaud de Pontac's only son, Fran&ccedil;ois Auguste de Pontac, died in 1694 and Pontack the tavern-keeper was alive in London in 1695. Pontack no doubt associated himself with the name and prestige of Arnaud de Pontac, for he displayed the sign of the president outside his tavern, and the assumption that the tavern-keeper Pontack was related to Arnaud de Pontac was current by the early eighteenth century. The president was renowned for his wisdom, but also gave his name to a renowned French wine, which also promoted the tavern's success: his vineyard at Haut-Brion produced &#145;the choicest of our Burdeaux-Wines&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.329). In 1720 John Strype described Pontack's tavern as &#145;a noted Ordinary for the better Sort, and for a kind of French Wine so called&#146;  (Strype, 2.190).<br>
<br>Pontack's tavern was initially established on the site of 16 and 17 Lombard Street in the City of London, near the Royal Exchange, some time after the great fire in 1666. About 1688&#150;90 Pontack moved his tavern from Lombard Street to the east side of Abchurch Lane in Candlewick ward and his old premises were soon occupied by Edward Lloyd, a coffee-house keeper and founder of the famous Lloyd's Coffee House.<br>
<br>Soon after relocating Pontack's became the most fashionable eating-house in London. The Royal Society held its annual dinners there until 1746, when they were moved to the Devil tavern at Temple Bar. Fellows of the Royal Society frequently patronized Pontack's and could gather in numbers as large as forty on a single evening. The quality of the customers entertained at Pontack's, the rather high cost of the meals, and the lack of many other serious competitors allowed the place to maintain its reputation as London's premier eating-house. In 1697 the Frenchman Henri Misson's guide to travel in England noted that &#145;those who would dine at one or two guineas per head are handsomely accommodated at our famous Pontack's [but] rarely and difficultly elsewhere&#146;  (Misson, 146). Pontack himself, however, boasted to Jonathan Swift in August 1711 that &#145;although his wine was so good, he sold it cheaper than others&#151;he took but seven shillings a flask&#146;, and Swift agreed, exclaiming that these were very &#145;pretty rates&#146;  (Swift, 1.334).<br>
<br>Like the coffee houses of post-Restoration London, Pontack's tavern also seems to have been a notable centre for disseminating news and political rumour, and thus Pontack's own discourse with his customers could have great impact outside his tavern. On 17 August 1695, Narcissus Luttrell reported that Pontack was &#145;examined before the Lord Mayor for being author of the late report that the king was missing, and gave bail to answer for the same&#146;  (Luttrell, 3.513). Pontack's was certainly a favoured place of resort for whig nobles, as Jonathan Swift observed on 25 January 1713, surmising that &#145;they have some damned design&#146;  (Swift, 2.608). It also hosted occasional meetings of the Candlewick wardmote inquests in the early eighteenth century  (Lillywhite, 452&#150;3).<br>
<br>The social scene at Pontack's tavern was commonly ridiculed as host to the excessively luxurious and Francophile tastes of London's social &eacute;lite. Susannah Centlivre ridiculed the &#145;modish kick-shaws&#146; such as &#145;famed ragouts&#146;, and &#145;new invented sallad&#146;, pretentiously desired by the &#145;nice beaus&#146; at Pontack's in the preface to her play <span class="italic">Love's Contrivance</span> of 1703  (Centlivre, 2. sig. A3<i>v</i>). After the collapse of the South Sea Bubble <span class="italic">Mist's Journal</span> shed few tears over the &#145;Jews and late South Sea directors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mist's Journal</span>, 1 April 1721), who could no longer afford to dine at Pontack's and were thus forced to resort to a common chop house.<br>
<br>It is not known when Pontack died, but by 1736 the tavern was no longer in his hands and was run by Mrs Susannah Austin, a widow who married William Pepys, a banker in Lombard Street. By this time Mrs Austin had already &#145;acquired a considerable fortune&#146; through her proprietorship of the famous tavern  (<span class="italic">Weekly Oracle</span>, 15 Jan 1736). Pontack's fame continued well after his death, and his head is seen on some copies of plate three of Hogarth's <span class="italic">Rake's Progress</span>.<br>
