<span class="headword">Boot,  Henry Albert Howard <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1917&#150;1983), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 29 July 1917 in Hall Green, Birmingham, the elder child and only son of Henry James Boot, electrical engineer at the firm of Bellings, and his wife, Ruby May Beeson. Always known as Harry he was educated at King Edward's High School, Birmingham, and at Birmingham University, where he studied physics and graduated BSc in 1938. He had begun work for his PhD (which he obtained in 1941) when war broke out.<br>
<br>Mark Oliphant, professor of physics at Birmingham University, had recently been to Stanford University where he had encountered the klystron, an electron tube which could generate microwave radiation for use in radar. He put Boot, J. T. Randall, and James Sayers to work on the problem of developing microwave generators (centimetric wave transmitters). Boot and Randall used the magnetron, a thermionic valve capable of producing high power oscillations in the microwave region. By late February 1940 they had constructed a new type of cavity magnetron, with a radiation wavelength of 9.8 cm. By May 1940 an experimental radar set using a pulsed 10 cm cavity magnetron had been built at the Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Swanage, and by September 1940 a submarine periscope could be detected at a range of 7 miles.<br>
<br>The cavity magnetron&#151;later improved by James Sayers&#151;crucially influenced the outcome of the war, for centimetric radar enabled a precise radar beam and small lightweight radar transmitters to be used. At first Bomber Command aircraft used the transmitters in night raids, and soon anti-aircraft units, convoy escorts, and night fighters all carried the equipment. Thousands of cavity magnetrons had been manufactured by the end of the Second World War. Boot and Randall were given a prize of &pound;50 from the Royal Society of Arts &#145;for improving the safety of life at sea&#146; in 1945; when they applied to the royal commission for awards to inventors in 1949 they and James Sayers received &pound;36,000.<br>
<br>In 1943 the Birmingham physics department returned to the study of atomic physics (for atomic bombs) and Boot moved for a time to British Thomson-Houston at Rugby to continue the development of very high power magnetrons. He rejoined the Birmingham department (to help build the cyclotron) in 1945 as a Nuffield research fellow. In 1948 he entered government service as a principal scientific officer with the Royal Naval Scientific Service in the Services Electronics Research Laboratories (SERL) at Baldock in Hertfordshire, and in the same year married Penelope May, daughter of Luke Herrington, an engineer; they had two sons. Boot was appointed senior principal scientific officer in 1954 and remained at Baldock until his retirement in 1977.<br>
<br>During his latter years in Birmingham and at Baldock, Boot continued his work on microwaves and magnetrons and further researched on plasma physics, controlled thermonuclear fusion, lasers, masers, and infra-red viewing devices. He had exceptional success in designing, constructing, and operating powerful electrical devices, beginning as a schoolboy with generators of X-rays and of high voltages. He was awarded the John Price Wetherill medal of the Franklin Institute (1958) and the John Scott award (with J. T. Randall, 1959).<br>
<br>Boot and his wife lived for thirty years in a thatched cottage at Rushden, Hertfordshire, with 5 acres of land (although Boot disliked gardening) and a garage full of fifty assorted magnetrons. His great love was sailing; he kept two boats at Salcombe in Devon. He was a quiet, modest, and tactful man, neat in his dress and habits of work. He had a friendly and discerning manner, together with a mildly sardonic sense of humour. Boot died on 8 February 1983 in the Hope Nursing Home, Cambridge. He was survived by his wife. One of the prototype cavity magnetrons built by GEC went to the Institution of Electrical Engineers and several from Boot's own collection were given to Hatfield Polytechnic.<br>
