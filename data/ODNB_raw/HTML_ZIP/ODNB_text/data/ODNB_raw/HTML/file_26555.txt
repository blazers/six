<span class="headword">Stokes,  George Thomas</span>  (1843&#150;1898), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, the eldest son of John Stokes of Athlone and Margaret Forster, his wife, was born in that town on 28 December 1843. He was educated at Galway grammar school, Queen's College, Galway, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1864. He subsequently proceeded MA in 1871, BD in 1881, and DD in 1886. In 1866 Stokes was ordained for the curacy of Dunkerrin in the diocese of Killaloe in the established Church of Ireland, and in the following year was appointed to the curacy of St Patrick's, Newry. In 1868 he was nominated first vicar of the newly constituted charge of All Saints, Newtown Park, Blackrock, co. Dublin, which he held until his death. In 1893 he was elected by the chapter of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, to the prebend and canonry of St Andrew. Stokes was twice married: first to Fanny, daughter of Thomas Pusey of Surbiton, Surrey, and second to Katherine, daughter of Henry J. Dudgeon of the Priory, Stillorgan, co. Dublin.<br>
<br>Stokes early displayed a taste for historical and antiquarian research. From the date of his appointment to All Saints his leisure time was devoted to his work on the ecclesiastical history of his own country. His expertise in this field led to his selection by Dr Reichel as his deputy in the chair of ecclesiastical history in the University of Dublin; and in 1883, on the termination of his principal's period of office, Stokes was appointed his successor. The appointment seemed well justified when, soon after, his researches bore fruit in his <span class="italic">Ireland and the Celtic Church</span>, published in 1886, which achieved an immediate success. This was followed in 1889 by his <span class="italic">Ireland and the Anglo-Norman Church</span>, in which the history of Irish Christianity was traced through a further stage.<br>
<br>Stokes intended to continue his history of the Irish church, but his scheme was interrupted by the laborious task of producing for the <span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span> series his <span class="italic">Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles</span> (1892), in which he succeeded in presenting the latest results of historical criticism of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in a popular and well-written form.<br>
<br>From 1880 onwards Stokes's great industry enabled him to add largely, and in many directions, to the more important productions above enumerated. In 1887 he published, as the second volume of a <span class="italic">Sketch of Universal History</span>, a <span class="italic">Sketch of Medieval History</span>. In 1891 he published an edition of Bishop Richard Pococke's <span class="italic">Tour in Ireland</span> of 1752. He was an occasional contributor on subjects connected with theology and ecclesiastical history to the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. Among his many articles in the periodical, that on &#145;Alexander Knox and the Oxford Movement&#146; is perhaps the most important (August 1887). He produced numerous papers for the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland in the short period of 1890&#150;99, having been made a member in 1887, and for the Royal Irish Academy, of which he had become a member in 1891. In 1887 he was appointed librarian of Marsh's Library, in Dublin, a position especially suited to his tastes.<br>
<br>In addition to the works already mentioned Stokes published: <span class="italic">The Work of the Laity of the Church of Ireland</span> (1869); various articles in Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Biography</span> (1880&#150;87); and, in conjunction with the Revd C. H. Wright, a translation of the writings of St Patrick (1887). He also published <span class="italic">St Hugh of Rehan: his church, his life and his times and additional note on the MacGeoghegan family</span> ([1897?]) and edited the <span class="roman">Liber Niger</span> (register of Archbishop Alen), held in Trinity College, Dublin, for the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland (1893 and 1897).<br>
<br>It is, however, upon Stokes's two volumes on the early history of the church in Ireland that his fame mainly rests. These two works are based on lectures which he delivered to the Dublin University school of divinity. He had often been asked to recommend a history of Ireland written in a contemporary and interesting fashion; being unable to do so he decided to write one himself. The works are a synthesis of his historical and ecclesiastical thought. They are written in a stimulating yet amusing style, are non-controversial, non-sectarian, impartial, yet highly interesting. In them Stokes displayed the wealth of his knowledge of early Irish saints and of Christianity, as well as of later political and historical developments. He drew on his own studies of Christianity, on contemporary nineteenth-century scholarship, and on unedited texts. He often complained of the lack of editions of earlier works: some he later edited himself. The history is a synthesis of his thought and research, presented in a most readable form. Some of the early Christian chapters were later developed into works in their own right. Regrettably he did not complete the projected series.<br>
<br>Stokes did not, however, confine his research and publication to ecclesiastical matters only. The pages of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland</span> contain many articles on local history, a number of which later appeared in book form. One of the best-known is <span class="italic">Guide to Blackrock [co. Dublin], with a description of the neighbourhood and excursions to the numerous objects of interest and attraction</span> ([1892]); another was a joint publication with John Burgess&#151;<span class="italic">Athlone, the Shannon and Lough Ree, a guide-book to their history, scenery and antiquities &hellip; with a local directory</span> ([1897]). In 1891 he had exhibited a manuscript of a tour to Lough Derg to a meeting of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. To the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span> he contributed papers on Greek.<br>
<br>In spite of these varied labours Stokes did not neglect his clerical duties. In 1895 he was temporarily disabled by a stroke, from the effects of which he never fully recovered. In 1896 he delivered a series of lectures entitled &#145;How to write a parochial history&#146;, and, in the following year he started an instructive course of lectures entitled &#145;Great Irish churchmen of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&#146;, which he did not live to complete. They were edited after his death, under the title <span class="italic">Some Worthies of the Irish Church</span> (1900), by the Revd H. J. Lawlor, who succeeded to his professorial chair. On 24 March 1898 Stokes succumbed, after a brief struggle, to an attack of pneumonia. He was buried at Dean's Grange, co. Dublin. His obituary might well be taken from his preface to <span class="italic">Ireland and the Celtic Church</span>: &#145;I must in the last place, express the hope that no words of mine may help to deepen the wounds of Ireland, or cause pain to any generous heart, no matter what his religion or politics&#146;<br>
