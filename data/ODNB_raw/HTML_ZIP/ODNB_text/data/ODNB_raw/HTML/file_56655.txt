<span class="headword">Hutchinson,  (Christian) Victor Noel Hope  Hely-</span>  (1901&#150;1947), <span class="occ">composer and music administrator</span>, was born on 26 December 1901 at Newlands House, Newlands, Cape Town, Cape Colony, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76282/', "Sir Walter Francis Hely-Hutchinson (1849&#150;1913)")</script>, son of the earl of Donoughmore and last governor of Cape Colony, and his wife, May Justice (1861&#150;1938).<br>
<br>As an infant Hely-Hutchinson grew up in Kent, where his talent for music was recognized by Charles Hoby, director of music of the Royal Marines at Chatham. After he returned to South Africa in 1907 his training was undertaken by Barrow Dowling, organist of Cape Town Cathedral. Shortly after his father's retirement to England, he was taken to the Royal College of Music on 25 January 1910 to see Sir Hubert Parry, who recommended study with a former pupil, Donald Tovey. (In October 1918 he would be pallbearer at Parry's funeral at St Paul's Cathedral.) In order to be near Tovey, he was educated at Heatherdown preparatory school, Ascot, and he won a scholarship to Eton College in 1914. Having studied harmony and counterpoint with some thoroughness under Tovey, he took extra-mural composition lessons in the later war years from Sir Charles Stanford, who had moved to Windsor to escape the bombing of London, and later from Gustav Holst; he also studied conducting with Adrian Boult.<br>
<br>In 1919 Hely-Hutchinson won the Lewis Nettleship memorial scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, though his time at the university (September 1920 to December 1921) was curtailed by the offer of a lecturing post at the South African College of Music (later part of the University of Cape Town) from its director, W. H. Bell. In South Africa he married on 22 June 1925 Marjorie Anna Hugo (1900&#150;1988), a capable violinist and a silver medal winner at the Royal Academy of Music in 1919. They had two sons, John and Christopher. Hely-Hutchinson's work as a lecturer was supplemented by broadcasting on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> for the South African Broadcasting Corporation (where he was known as &#145;Uncle Porps&#146;), experience which served him well when he returned to England in 1926 as a musical assistant for the BBC at Savoy Hill.<br>
<br>Hely-Hutchinson's work at the BBC involved not only programme planning but also conducting, arranging, accompanying (he was an able pianist), and appearances on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> as &#145;Uncle Bunny&#146;. In 1933 he moved to Birmingham as the BBC's midland regional director of music and founded the BBC Midland Orchestra. A year later, in succession to Granville Bantock, he was appointed professor of music at Birmingham University, a post he held until 1944. In Birmingham, Hely-Hutchinson was active as the president of the Brass Bands Association and conducted the city orchestra. During the Second World War he enrolled as an ARP warden and joined the university cadet force, and in order to raise money for the city orchestra he gave a series of recitals of all Beethoven's piano sonatas; he subsequently repeated this at Oxford in aid of a memorial to Tovey. In 1944 he returned to London as the BBC's director of music, succeeding Arthur Bliss. During the severe winter at the beginning of 1947 he developed influenza, and he died of acute meningitis on 11 March at 26 Queen's Grove, St John's Wood, London; he was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. He was only forty-five. Months before, he had been involved in controversy when he oversaw the termination of Constant Lambert's connection with the Promenade Concerts and the appointment of Malcolm Sargent as chief conductor.<br>
<br>Though his professional creative life was relatively short, Hely-Hutchinson was highly productive. He composed a wide range of incidental music for films and plays; the latter included productions of C. K. Munro's <span class="italic">The Rumour</span>, Laurence Housman's <span class="italic">The House Fairy</span>, and Walter de la Mare's <span class="italic">Yes, and Back Again</span> (all 1930). Like Armstrong Gibbs and Herbert Howells, he evinced a penchant for the poetry of de la Mare, which is reflected in his many songs, but his most enduring settings are those of Edward Lear's nonsense rhymes (1927), &#145;Old Mother Hubbard&#146; (1929), an amusing Handelian parody, and <span class="italic">Ruthless Rhymes</span>, to words by Harry Graham (1945&#150;6). His chamber works include a piano quintet, a string quartet, and a viola sonata, none of which was published. The more impressive <span class="italic">Variations, Intermezzo, Scherzo and Finale</span>, dedicated to W. H. Bell, was published by the Carnegie Trust and first performed at a Promenade Concert in 1927. Described by the composer as a set of symphonic variations, the work exhibits a fresh, vibrant technique and a polished, colourful orchestral palette. An affinity for classical structures was foreshadowed in the <span class="italic">Three Fugal Fancies</span> for strings (1925) and echoed with greater aplomb in <span class="italic">The Young Idea</span> for piano and orchestra (1928), though it was in the popular <span class="italic">Carol Symphony</span> (1927), a suite of movements based on popular Christmas carols, that his lighter style achieved a particular eloquence alongside passages of greater warmth and even pathos. Some of his film music was later reworked into a symphony for small orchestra. Undergoing revision at the time of his death, this was heard during the 1947 season of promenade concerts.<br>
