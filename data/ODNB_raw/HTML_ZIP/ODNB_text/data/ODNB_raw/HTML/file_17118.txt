<span class="headword">Luard,  John</span>  (1790&#150;1875), <span class="occ">army officer, author, and artist</span>, was the fourth son of Captain Peter John Luard (<i>d</i>. 23 May 1830) of the 4th light dragoons and of Blyborough, Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Louisa, daughter of Charles Dalbiac of Hungerford Park, Berkshire. He was born on 5 May 1790, served in the Royal Navy 1802&#150;7, and on 25 May 1809 obtained a cornetcy without purchase in his father's former regiment, with which he served through the Peninsular campaigns of 1810&#150;14. Afterwards he served with the 16th light dragoons (later lancers) as lieutenant at Waterloo and as captain at Bharatpur in 1825. In India he instructed his regiment in the use of the lance and was reportedly the first to use it in the British army, at Bharatpur. He exchanged to the 30th regiment in 1832, retired as major in 1834, and obtained a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy in 1838. In retirement he was a director of the London and South-Western railway. He had married in 1826 Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel William Scott of the East India Company; they had two daughters and four sons including Lieutenant-General Richard Luard and Major-General Frederick Luard.<br>
<br>Like others of his family, Luard had much artistic talent. He published <span class="italic">Views in India, St Helena, and Car Nicobar</span> (1835), illustrated by himself, and <span class="italic">History of the Dress of the British Soldier</span> (1852), which includes original sketches of military characters and costume from the Peninsular War. Luard died on 24 October 1875 at his home, The Cedars, Farnham, Surrey.<br>
<br>His second son, <a name="cosubject_17118"></a><span class="headword">John Dalbiac Luard</span>  (1830&#150;1860), <span class="occ">army officer and artist</span>, born at Blyborough on 31 October 1830, was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was appointed ensign without purchase in the 63rd in 1848, and transferred to the 82nd regiment. After obtaining his lieutenancy in 1853, he left the service to devote himself to art, and studied for a time under John Phillip RA. He exhibited his first picture at the Royal Academy in 1855, <span class="italic">A Church Door</span>. He spent the winter of 1855&#150;6 in the Crimea with his brother, Major Luard, then on the headquarters staff at Sevastopol. In 1857 he exhibited a Crimean subject, <span class="italic">The Welcome Arrival</span> (National Army Museum), which, engraved, had some popularity, and two others in 1858. He was a friend of Millais, with whom he shared lodgings for a time. His health failed, and he died at Winterslow, near Salisbury, on 9 August 1860.<br>
