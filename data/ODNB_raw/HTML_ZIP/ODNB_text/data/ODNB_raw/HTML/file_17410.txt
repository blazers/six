<span class="headword">McCulloch <span class="st"> [Macculloch]</span>,  Horatio</span>  (1805&#150;1867), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Glasgow in November 1805, the son of Alexander McCulloch (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1827), cotton merchant, and his wife, Margaret Watson. He studied art under John Knox, the landscape, portrait, and panorama painter in Glasgow, and was a friend of the artists Daniel Macnee and William Leighton Leitch. McCulloch and Macnee left Glasgow to work at Cumnock in Ayrshire, then moved to Edinburgh where they were employed by William Home Lizars, the engraver.<br>
<br>McCulloch's earliest documented work, <span class="italic">Portrait of a Boy</span>, was shown by a Glasgow printseller in 1819. In 1828 the Glasgow Dilettanti Society's first exhibition had four works by McCulloch, including two studies; his tendency to show sketches aroused some criticism. From 1829 he exhibited with the Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and was elected an associate in 1834. Although he occasionally contributed to exhibitions in Manchester, Liverpool, Dublin, Belfast, and London, his work was not that well known in England. His early paintings reflect the style of Alexander Nasmyth and John Knox in their classical composition and meticulous technique but, following his move to Edinburgh, he came under the influence of the Revd John Thomson of Duddingston, then Scotland's most admired landscape artist, in his Romantic vision of the country and exuberant brushwork, and Hugh William &#145;Grecian&#146; Williams. McCulloch's painting became more spontaneous and fluid and he can be regarded as a pioneer of a freer style of watercolour painting. Although contemporary critics emphasized the &#145;natural&#146; quality of his works, Alexander Fraser, his fellow artist, friend, and biographer, wrote that he &#145;did not want to know too much of anything; for him objects of sight were to be studied only as they were objects of taste&#151;food for imagination, or as they appealed to his sense of beauty or grandeur&#146;  (Fraser, 37).<br>
<br>McCulloch was an outstanding and influential painter of the Scottish landscape whose work appeared in a variety of settings. Robert Napier, the renowned marine engineer, had him decorate panels for steamships; his views were used to illustrate the <span class="italic">Steam Boat Companion</span> (1831), published by James Lumsden, a major patron; they also appeared in <span class="italic">The Scottish Annual</span> (1836), William Beattie's <span class="italic">Scotland Illustrated</span> (1838), and <span class="italic">Scotland Delineated</span> (1847&#150;54). His work was acquired by the art unions in Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as by private collectors. McCulloch was particularly drawn to the western highlands and islands, Stirlingshire, Lanarkshire, and Renfrewshire. The Isle of Skye also provided great inspiration and it was there that he married Marcella McLellan on 6 September 1847.<br>
<br>In the 1850s and 1860s McCulloch's style changed; this is most obvious in his outdoor studies, which reveal a greater interest in detail and composition. Some of his best-known and most popular pictures date from this period, including <span class="italic">My Heart's in the Highlands</span> (1860, Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum), commissioned by the Royal Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland and engraved by William Forrest for its <span class="italic">Illustrated Songs of Robert Burns</span> (1861). <span class="italic">Glencoe</span> (1864, Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum), regarded as one of the most pictorially successful of the later works, is the most reproduced of all his images of Scotland. He and Landseer, more than any other mid-nineteenth-century artist, contributed to the popular Victorian image of the highlands, revealing nature in all its elements.<br>
<br>Alexander Fraser wrote that, as a young man, McCulloch was popular for his &#145;good-heartedness, and merry, harem-scarem disposition&#146;  (Fraser, 19). One portrait by Daniel Macnee (1842, Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum) captures a fresh-faced artist gazing eagerly; it contrasts with the more rugged appearance photographed by Thomas Annan in the 1860s and included in Fraser's monograph. McCulloch died at his home, St Colm Villa, Trinity, Leith, near Edinburgh, on 24 June 1867 and was buried in Warriston cemetery in Edinburgh on 28 June. His works are in the collections of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum; the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh; Perth Museum and Art Gallery; McManus Galleries, Dundee; and other public collections.<br>
