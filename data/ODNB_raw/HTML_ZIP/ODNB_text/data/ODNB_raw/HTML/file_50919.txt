<span class="headword">Garthwaite,  Anna Maria</span>  (1688&#150;1763?), <span class="occ">textile designer</span>, was born on 14 March 1688 at Harston, Leicestershire, the second of the three daughters of the Revd Ephraim Garthwaite (<i>d</i>. 1719), rector of Grantham, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Rejoyce, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henstead. The first forty years of her life were spent in Lincolnshire where her father was a well-connected Anglican clergyman with family associations with the City of London. After his death in 1719 it is probable that she went to live with her elder sister, Mary, the wife of Robert Dannye, rector of Spofforth, Yorkshire. In 1729 or 1730 Dannye died, and both sisters then went to London, where they eventually settled in Princes Street (now 2 Princelet Street) in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields. Their choice of residence may have related to a connection to the locality via the Bacon family, but germane to Anna Maria's professional life was the significance of Spitalfields as the centre of the quality eighteenth-century silk industry in England.<br>
<br>The Garthwaite daughters, to each of whom their father left a legacy of &pound;500 as well as his library, were probably well educated in a conventional manner, Anna Maria having had particular aptitude for design and botanical drawing. Her interest in textile design was apparent by 1726, when she collected and annotated a series of textile designs, &#145;by diverse hands&#146;, which included technically innovative and high-quality French work. Her first drawing, inscribed &#145;sent to London before I left York&#146;, was competent but simple. The largest series of her work, comprising many hundreds of drawings of silk designs and patterns, some of which are still enrolled in their contemporary arrangement covering the period from 1726 to 1756, has survived and is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. It is clear that, at a time when the English silk industry vied with French manufacturers for the quality home and export market, she was one of the foremost designers of &#145;flowered&#146;, or brocaded, silks.<br>
<br>The V&amp;A collection shows that Garthwaite was capable of working within all the stylistic trends of the period. Her designs with a floral emphasis have particular grace and individuality, and her work demonstrates considerable ability in placing these against the fashionable formal background. Noteworthy is her interest in some rare exotics. Her output was at its highest in the 1730s and 1740s, when such patterns were most fashionable, and at her peak she was producing eighty designs a year. In the early 1750s the numbers declined sharply and by 1756 she had varied her range to include a flowered gauze and a carpet pattern. Silks of her design have been found not only in the United Kingdom but also in Europe and North America.<br>
<br>The enrolled lists and the annotations, probably in her own hand, show her to have been working for silkmen at the top level of the market concerned with textiles which were time-consuming to weave and costly to manufacture. She displayed a noteworthy grasp of textile technique, including technical direction as necessary. Surviving silks show how well her designs adapt to form and function. Garthwaite point paper, imprinted with squares for drafting designs in the early nineteenth century, may be a retrospective tribute to her expertise. The basis for her technical knowledge can only be conjectured, though Robert Campart, a Spitalfields ribbon weaver of Huguenot extraction, is named as a beneficiary, together with his wife, in Garthwaite's will.<br>
<br>Since the status of silk designers was high, and their role in the export trade crucial, it is unfortunate that the female silk designer so favourably referred to in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for 1749  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 319) and adversely criticized in F. Rouquet's <span class="italic">L'&eacute;tat des arts en Angleterre</span> of 1755  (Rouquet, 111) is not named. However, P. K. T. Thornton has made a convincing case for Garthwaite's authorship of &#145;Of designing and drawing of ornaments, &hellip; for the use of the flowered silk manufactory, embroidery and printing (of the various kinds of flower'd silks)&#146; in the 1759 edition of G. Smith's <span class="italic">The Laboratory or School of Arts</span>. Knowledgeable, lucid, and amusing, it sheds a somewhat jaundiced light on the role of the English silk designer as opposed to the French, at a time when the English silk industry was about to enter a period of crisis. The heartfelt comments that &#145;a new pattern drawer will come into vogue and the old experienced one will be discarded. These ungenerous proceedings I have experienced myself&#146;  (Garthwaite) may have oblique reference to Garthwaite's diminishing output after 1750.<br>
<br>It is not known where or exactly when Garthwaite died, but on 24 October 1763, at Princes Street in the parish of Christ Church, the 1758 will of Anna Maria Garthwaite, spinster, in which she left a fairly modest estate of about &pound;600, was proved. Bequests imply a friendly, well-provided household but there is no mention of designs, though these were valued tools of the trade. Her sister, Mary Dannye, in whose Yorkshire estate she was to have an interest, predeceased her. Their niece, Mary Baron, was the main beneficiary.<br>
