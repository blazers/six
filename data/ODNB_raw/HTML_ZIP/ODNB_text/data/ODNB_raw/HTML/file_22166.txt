<span class="headword">Phillips,  Molesworth</span>  (1755&#150;1832), <span class="occ">marine officer</span>, born on 15 August 1755, was the son of John Phillips (<i>b</i>. 1711) of Swords, co. Dublin, and his wife, Henrietta Eccleston. John Phillips was the natural son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18901/', "Robert Molesworth, first Viscount Molesworth")</script>. Molesworth Phillips first entered the Royal Navy, but on the advice of his friend Joseph Banks he accepted a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Marines on 17 January 1776. In this capacity he was selected to command the marines of both ships of Captain Cook on his last voyage, extending over nearly three years. He sailed with Cook from Plymouth on 12 July 1776, and was in charge of the marines who escorted Cook when he landed at Hawaii on 14 February 1779 and was fatally wounded in an attack by the Hawaiians. Phillips was wounded at the same time with an iron spike but managed to shoot his assailant dead. Unable to reload in time Phillips and the surviving marines made for the pinnace which was lying close offshore in accordance with an order given by Cook before his death. On reaching the pinnace Phillips saw that one of his wounded marines was in difficulty and, in spite of his own injuries, he jumped overboard and succeeded in rescuing him. John Webber's picture <span class="italic">Death of Captain Cook</span> represents Phillips firing from a sitting posture at the moment that Cook was being stabbed to death. On the voyage home Phillips fought an inconclusive duel at the Cape with his brother officer John Williamson.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1780 Phillips was promoted captain, and on 10 January 1782 he married Susanna Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1755, <i>d</i>. 1800), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4078/', "Charles Burney (1726&#150;1814)")</script> and his first wife, Esther Sleepe, and sister of Frances (Fanny) Burney (later Madame d'Arblay) and of James Burney, Phillips's friend, who, like him, had accompanied Cook on his last voyage. This marriage brought Phillips into connection with the Burneys' literary and musical friends&#151;Dr Johnson, Mrs Thrale, and others. He was promoted brevet major on 1 March 1794, and brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1798. From 1784, for the sake of his wife's health, he lived for a time at Boulogne, but after the French Revolution the Phillipses lived chiefly at Mickleham, Surrey, not far from Juniper Hall, where Talleyrand was residing, to whom Phillips showed much kindness and hospitality. When the English government obliged the former to seek refuge in America, the colonel assisted him in fitting out for the voyage and accompanied him to Falmouth. In the late 1790s during the alarm of a French invasion of Ireland and the Irish rising, Phillips felt it his duty to reside on the Irish estates at Belcotton, near Drogheda, which he had inherited from an uncle. Here he was joined reluctantly in 1796 by his wife. In the face of her husband's indifference and possible infidelity, Susanna's health gave way and she was allowed to leave Ireland. Shortly after reaching England she died on 6 January 1800 near Chester and was buried on 12 January near Neston on the Wirral peninsula. On 4 October of that year, at St Anne's Church, Dublin, Phillips married Ann Maturin (1774&#150;1830/31), sister of his son's tutor and daughter of the Revd Charles Maturin, of co. Down, Ireland; her uncle, Captain Gabriel Maturin, was secretary to General Thomas Gage.<br>
<br>In 1802 Phillips with his family visited France without permission, and they were detained under Napoleon's decree. He appealed to Talleyrand, who allowed two letters to remain unanswered. A third, couched in rather strong terms, produced an order for the release of the party, and Phillips returned to England on parole in the summer of 1804. When passing through Paris Phillips in vain solicited an audience of his former friend. After his return to England Phillips was the subject of an investigation in 1806 into his parole during which it was pointed out that he had performed no sea time in recent years and &#145;that on two occasions the last War he paid money to a Brother Officer to embark for him&#146; and that &#145;he has been a complete shuffler from all Duties&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/3317, no. 469). Later he became acquainted with Southey; Mary and Charles Lamb, who described him as &#145;the high-minded associate of Cook, the veteran colonel, with his lusty heart still sending cartels of defiance to old Time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life, Letters and Writings</span>, 4.75); and John Thomas Smith (1766&#150;1833), whom he supplied with various anecdotes for his <span class="italic">Nollekens and his Times</span>  (1.164, 200, 2.218). He died of cholera at his house in Lambeth on 11 September 1832, and was buried in St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
<br>With Susanna Burney Phillips had two sons, Norbury and William, and one daughter, Frances, who kept house for her grandfather, Dr Burney, and married C. C. Raper. Phillips also had one daughter, Elizabeth, with his second wife, Ann, who predeceased him, aged fifty-seven.<br>
