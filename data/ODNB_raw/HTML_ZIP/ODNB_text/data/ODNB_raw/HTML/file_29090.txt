<span class="headword">West,  Joseph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was probably born in England, with a possible connection to the West family in Sussex. Little else is known about his early life, except that he was a London merchant before his departure for America. West served in the Royal Navy during the Second Anglo-Dutch War under the command of James Carteret. James was the son of Sir George Carteret, one of the eight proprietors of Carolina. On 27 July 1669 the lords proprietors gave West command of a small fleet and ordered him to sail from England to Port Royal, South Carolina, by way of Ireland and Barbados. This &#145;first fleet&#146; arrived at its final destination in April 1670, and settled along a waterway named the Ashley River (in honour of proprietor Anthony Ashley Cooper, first Baron Ashley and first earl of Shaftesbury) at a place called Charlestown. The designated governor, William Sayle, then took command of the colony. West established residence in the settlement and soon became the proprietary shopkeeper and a member of the grand council. When Sayle died in March 1671, local leaders gave West the responsibility of governing the fledgeling colony. His wife, known only as Joanna (<i>d</i>. in or before 1681), joined him in Carolina in August 1671.<br>
<br>Historians credit West, through his rational management of material resources and people, with the early survival of the South Carolina colony. However, the proprietors were less pleased with his performance. West routinely ignored directives from London, which typically offered advice ill suited to circumstances in the nascent colony and which demanded that the settlers search for a profitable staple crop. He favoured a more practical plantation programme. As a result, the proprietors replaced West as governor, appointing Sir John Yeamans to the office in April 1672. West then returned to his position as proprietary shopkeeper and he also became the registrar of the colony's land records.<br>
<br>Yeamans quickly proved an unsatisfactory choice; during his administration the settlement did not become self-sufficient. Planters exported locally grown produce to the West Indies, the lords proprietors continued to supply the settlers with foodstuffs, and the governor pocketed the profits. When Yeamans died in office in August 1674, the grand council appointed West as his temporary replacement. The proprietors had already commissioned West as the permanent governor the previous April, but the slow transmission of information across the Atlantic delayed news of his official return to power.<br>
<br>In his second administration West again pursued the physical and economic security of the colony. In 1678 the settlement moved to a more defensible geographic position at Oyster Point. West fostered the deerskin trade and peaceable relations with the neighbouring American Indians, and he promoted agricultural and pastoral farming sufficient to meet the needs of residents and create a surplus for export. In May 1682, again dissatisfied with West's performance (he was accused of failing to suppress both trade with pirates and traffic in American Indian slaves), the proprietors of the colony commissioned a new governor named Joseph Morton. West returned to office briefly in September 1684 as a replacement elected by the council. He was later recommissioned by the proprietors, but persistent political factionalism and increasingly poor health appear to have caused him to resign as governor the following summer.<br>
<br>In an attempt to reverse the course of his illness, West left South Carolina for Massachusetts in late June or early July 1685. He arrived in Boston on 15 September and received visits from many of the colony's leading figures. Diarist Samuel Sewall recorded that the suffering West went to New England &#145;for cure of Dry Gripes&#146;, a common ailment caused by drinking rum distilled through lead pipes. Historians suggest that he may also have contracted malaria, which plagued Charlestown in 1684. The colony's governor, Simon Bradstreet, called on West ten days after his arrival in New England. In January 1686, with his health greatly improved, he dined at the governor's home. The following autumn West returned to South Carolina.<br>
<br>During his tenure in South Carolina West amassed a considerable fortune in land and slaves. As a cassique and landgrave he was entitled theoretically to 60,000 acres of land in the province. Records indicate that West actually owned a house and lot in Charlestown and a 130 acre plantation. He also obtained a grant for 1500 acres along the Cooper River in 1680. A magnificent illumination of the plan and grant of this property survives in the South Carolina Historical Society in Charleston. In 1685 West also owned ten African and two American Indian slaves, as well as the indentures of two male servants. After his return from Massachusetts in late 1686 West sold much of his estate. No evidence remains regarding his activities from the summer of 1687, when he left South Carolina, until his death in New York city in 1691. At this time his estate consisted of &pound;800 of gold and silver, an enslaved girl named Moll, and an enslaved man called Will. Without a surviving wife or children, West designated the Quaker poor of London as his residual heirs.<br>
