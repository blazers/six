<span class="headword">Portlock,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1747, <em>d.</em> 1817), <span class="occ">naval officer and fur trader</span>, was probably born at or near Norfolk, Virginia, possibly the son of Charles Portlock (<i>d</i>. after 15 February 1750) and his wife, Lydia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ridley (<i>d</i>. after 1756). According to the catalogue of pictures formerly in the Painted Hall, Greenwich, Portlock was impressed into the British navy when second mate of his brother's merchant ship. He entered the navy in 1772 as an able seaman on board the <i>St Albans</i>, with Captain Charles Douglas, who recognized his experience and placed him on the quarterdeck as a midshipman. He afterwards served in the <i>Ardent</i> and in the <i>Ramillies</i>, guardships in the Medway, and in 1776 was entered on board the <i>Discovery</i>, where he was rated as master's mate by Captain Charles Clerke. He continued in her during James Cook's celebrated voyage of circumnavigation until, in August 1779, he was moved into the <i>Resolution</i>. On returning to England he passed his lieutenant's examination on 7 September 1780, when he was officially stated on his passing certificate to be &#145;more than 32&#146;. On 14 September 1780 he was promoted to be lieutenant of the <i>Firebrand</i>, attached to the Channel Fleet. On 18 December 1781, at St Mary Aldermary, London, he married Elizabeth Gilmour.<br>
<br>In May 1785 Portlock was appointed by the King George's Sound Company (headed by Richard Cadman Etches) to command the <i>King George</i>, a vessel of 320 tons, and an expedition to the north-west coast of North America. She sailed from Gravesend on 29 August 1785, in company with the smaller ship <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, commanded by George Dixon. On 19 July 1786 they arrived at Cook Inlet and, after some stay there, ranged along the coast, sighted Mount St Elias, and on 29 September sailed for the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. There they wintered, and returned to the north-west coast of North America in March 1787. When winter approached they again sought the Sandwich Islands, and, after having refitted there and refreshed the men, both ships sailed separately for Macau where they arrived in November 1787. In February of the following year they made for England, the <i>King George</i> reaching Dover on 24 August 1788. With Dixon, Portlock published <span class="italic">A Voyage Round the World, but More Particularly to the North-West Coast of America</span> in 1789. Though rich in geographical results, the voyage was primarily intended to advance the fur trade, in which object it was fully successful.<br>
<br>In 1791 Portlock was appointed with Captain William Bligh to command the <i>Assistant</i> brig, going out as tender to the <i>Providence</i>, which had been ordered to the Pacific to bring breadfruit plants to the West Indies. During this second breadfruit voyage Portlock made many discoveries in company with Bligh during the passage through the south Pacific Ocean, especially Fiji. The ships returned to England in August 1793, and on 4 November Portlock was promoted to the rank of commander. In 1799 he commanded the <i>Arrow</i> sloop, with the tremendous armament of twenty-eight 32-pounder carronades, and on 9 September captured the Dutch ship <i>Draak</i>, at anchor in the narrow passage between Vlie and Harlingen. On 28 September Portlock was advanced to post rank, but he does not seem to have had any further service afloat. Instead he took command of the fencibles on the south coast. He was based at Poole and later moved to the Dartmouth area. There, on 20 January 1805, he directed the fencibles who saved the Danish vessel <i>Den Lille Catherina</i> from being wrecked in Bigbury Bay. The owners rewarded him with an inscribed silver goblet, later given by Portlock's son to the Royal Marines, in whose mess at Lympstone it remained in 1999. In later life he suffered greatly from ill health, and in 1816 he was admitted to the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, being appointed one of the four captains of the hospital. He died there on 12 September 1817, and was buried in the officers' vault in the hospital burial-ground. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22585/', "Joseph Ellison Portlock")</script>, achieved recognition as a geologist and surveyor.<br>
