<span class="headword">Glover,  Sarah Anna</span>  (1786&#150;1867), <span class="occ">music teacher</span>, was born on 13 November 1786 at Norwich, the eldest daughter of the Revd Edward Glover, incumbent of St Lawrence's Church, Norwich. The sculptor John Bell (1811&#150;1895) was a cousin. At the age of six she began receiving music lessons from Dr John Beckwith, the organist of Norwich Cathedral, eventually becoming &#145;an accomplished pianist&#146;. Studious, resolute, and devout, she never married. In her early twenties she ran a local Sunday school with her younger sister Christiana, and there she began making tentative efforts to produce a simplified system of musical notation.<br>
<br>Glover's first experiment involved pasting guide-letters on the piano keys to help unmusical teachers pick out unknown tunes. She later used both alphabetical and sol-fa names for the purpose, and from that point can be traced the evolution of her novel notation using the initials of the sol-fa syllables&#151;D, R, M, F, S, L, T&#151;to represent the rising major scale. She had Anglicized <i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>si</i> as Doh, Ra, Me, Fah, Sole, Lah, and Te, renaming the seventh degree to avoid confusion between the identical initials of <i>sol</i> and <i>si</i>. All these ideas sprang jointly from careful study of Burney's <span class="italic">General History of Music</span> and her experiences while teaching young children in local charity schools.<br>
<br>By 1827 Glover had drawn up a complete method in manuscript form and was using it as part of her daily teaching in a girls' school of her own founding in Black Boy Yard, Colegate Street, Norwich. Instead of following tradition by first memorizing orthodox musical symbols, her pupils sang from the outset, learning by means of sol-fa notes pointed out on a chart, her &#145;Norwich sol-fa ladder&#146;. Soon they were singing short phrases in canon and hymn tunes harmonized in two parts. All these were sung from a sol-fa tune book printed in Glover's &#145;Norwich sol-fa&#146; notation, comprising sol-fa initials and a few additional symbols to represent accent and duration.<br>
<br>A choir enrolled from Glover's pupils now sang each Sunday at the services in St Lawrence's Church, and there were many enquiries as to how such young children had learned to sing so skilfully. She was repeatedly pressed by visitors to publish an account of her training methods. But it was not until 1835, when her pupils' singing had made St Lawrence's Church widely celebrated, that she found a publisher in Jarrold &amp; Sons of Norwich and was able to produce a detailed summary of her method in print, under the allusive title <span class="italic">Scheme for rendering psalmody congregational, comprising a key to the sol-fa notation of music, and directions for instructing a school</span>.<br>
<br>In 1841 a copy of Glover's <span class="italic">Scheme</span> was lent to John Curwen, a young Congregationalist minister deeply interested in educational practice who was then examining various systems of teaching singing with a view to synthesizing a method suitable for general use. Excited by Glover's account, Curwen impulsively adopted, even modified, several of her devices as the basis of what became known as tonic sol-fa, but without seeking her permission. Despite Curwen's hastily expressed apologies and his repeated public acknowledgement of indebtedness to her, the strained relationship that understandably arose between them was resolved only during Glover's last years. She died of a stroke at Malvern on 20 October 1867 and was buried at Hereford, where she had retired only a few years earlier to live with her sister Christiana.<br>
