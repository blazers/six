<span class="headword">Cavendish,  Victor Christian William</span>, ninth duke of Devonshire  (1868&#150;1938), <span class="occ">politician and governor-general of Canada</span>, was born on 31 May 1868, the eldest son of Lord Edward Cavendish (1838&#150;1891) and his wife, Emma Elizabeth Lascelles (1838&#150;1920). He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1891. After leaving university he trained for several months in an accountant's office and studied law in the Inner Temple chambers of Judge Lush-Wilson. This pioneering form of management training prepared him for his responsibilities on the board of such family businesses as the Barrow Hematite Steel Company and the Furness Railway. Following the death of his father, who was Liberal Unionist MP for West Derbyshire, he was returned unopposed in June 1891 for the constituency, which he held until March 1908, when he succeeded his uncle (Spencer Compton Cavendish, marquess of Hartington and eighth duke of Devonshire) in the dukedom. On the death in December 1891 of his grandfather William Cavendish (the seventh duke), he inherited the Holker Hall estate in north Lancashire. On 30 July 1892 he married Lady Evelyn Emily Mary (1870&#150;1960), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35500/', "Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, fifth marquess of Lansdowne")</script>. They had two sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>As a politician who preferred listening to speaking, Cavendish was treasurer of the royal household (1900&#150;03) in the last Salisbury government. Under Balfour he was a painstaking financial secretary to the Treasury (1903&#150;05). He became a privy councillor after losing office in 1905, and was created GCVO in 1912, but rued his exclusion from the Commons after 1908. &#145;The Duchess says he can't think what to do in the evenings and that he writes all sorts of needless letters to kill time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Crawford Papers</span>, 108). However, he became an assiduous and influential member of the Lords during the tense years of the Asquith administration. His political opponent John Morley considered his interventions &#145;simple, direct, weighty and balanced&#146;  (FitzRoy, 460). In 1912 he was recruited to Bonar Law's shadow cabinet where he had a deserved reputation as a &#145;safe man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Crawford Papers</span>, 348).<br>
<br>Devonshire assumed numerous responsibilities after succeeding to the dukedom, together with some 186,000 acres. He was lord lieutenant of Derbyshire and high steward of Derby from 1908, honorary colonel of the 5th battalion of the Sherwood Foresters (the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire regiment) from 1908, mayor of Eastbourne (1909&#150;10) and of Chesterfield (1911&#150;12). He was also chancellor of the University of Leeds from 1910, and high steward of the University of Cambridge from 1923 (sitting on the council of Selwyn College). From 1908 he was president of the British Empire League. He was twice elected president of the Royal Agricultural Society (1908, 1932).<br>
<br>The duke, who was vice-president of the Navy League from 1909, returned to government in the wartime coalition as civil lord of the Admiralty (1915&#150;16). His replies on behalf of the Admiralty in the upper house were &#145;capital&#146;  (Sandhurst, 325). He received the Garter in January 1916, and in June succeeded the duke of Connaught as governor-general and commander-in-chief of Canada. He was created GCMG in July, and after landing in Canada in November during a critical phase of the war, consistently strove to sustain patriotic morale. The imposition of conscription had been resented, especially among the Qu&eacute;becois, and the wartime upheaval was followed by economic dislocation and social unrest. Devonshire's skilful treatment of different sections of Canadian opinion was widely acknowledged. His interventions in the intricacies of post-war Canadian party politics were deft and harmonious. He enjoyed discussing political tactics with his aide-de-camp <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40185/', "Harold Macmillan")</script>, who married his daughter Dorothy Evelyn Cavendish in 1920. The prince of Wales, touring the dominion in 1919, thought the duke was &#145;a damned good fellow and has no side&#146;, although stuck in a &#145;hopelessly narrow groove&#146;  (Davenport-Hines, 163). His appointment expired in August 1921.<br>
<br>Devonshire's sale of Devonshire House in Piccadilly for &pound;750,000 in 1920 inspired Siegfried Sassoon's &#145;Monody on the Demolition of Devonshire House&#146;. His refusal in March 1922 to serve as secretary of state for India under Lloyd-George damaged the prestige of the coalition government. An evolved whig rather than a tory die-hard, he supported the Irish settlement of 1922. After the fall of the coalition Devonshire joined Bonar Law's cabinet as secretary of state for the colonies in October 1922. As colonial secretary he issued the Devonshire declaration of 1923 that the interests of African natives must be paramount over those of immigrant settlers in Kenya colony. This announcement was pregnant with significance for future colonial policy, and was generally unexpected. It accorded with Devonshire's generous whiggish inclinations, and he withstood pressure to withdraw or amend the principle of paramountcy. Sir Maurice Hankey, the cabinet secretary, observed that Devonshire resembled &#145;an apoplectic idol and gives little counsel&#146;  (Roskill, 2.323). Crawford, however, described him in 1923:<blockquote>what a solid person he is&#151;uncouth in gesture, ponderous in appearance, slow in style&#151;yet giving the impression of saying all that requires statement and doing so without any effort to score a success. There is a massive imperturbability about him which gives confidence. He will never let one down, never play for his own advantage, never do anything brilliant. (<span class="italic">Crawford Papers</span>, 486)</blockquote>In cabinet he resisted attempts by Amery and other protectionists to extend safeguarding of industry. Baldwin's handling of the American debt question disquieted him, and he deplored the new prime minister's decision to go to the country on a protectionist platform. He left the Colonial Office in January 1924, and was not invited to hold office when Baldwin resumed power in November. It was believed that Baldwin contemplated offering him the lord presidency of the council until Curzon insisted on that office.<br>
<br>Devonshire in middle life resembled a solemn, ruddy-complexioned walrus with a strong jaw. Despite looking stolid and even sleepy, he was shrewd, tactful, observant, and clear-headed. His authority rested on real though unostentatious ability. During 1924&#150;5 he served as chairman of the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley and unobtrusively became one of its financial guarantors. In 1925 he accepted further public responsibilities, including the chairmanship of both a privy council committee to enquire into the Channel Islands' contributions to the imperial exchequer and the Sadler's Wells theatre trust. He went for the Easter holidays to Lismore Castle, where on 12 April 1925 he suffered a paralytic stroke. This changed him from a calm, impassive, and patient man into at best a querulous, morose invalid and at worst a ferocious bully. Although he relished the presence of his grandchildren, his domestic rages became increasingly unpleasant. The cold, authoritarian, and frugal duchess had anxiously reorganized the management of the Devonshire properties after 1908, and rose to greater ascendancy as her husband's mental condition deteriorated. She introduced nettle soup to Chatsworth menus to save expense, had Sir Joseph Paxton's great conservatory there dynamited in 1920, and replanted his garden with rhododendrons and bamboo. The duke continued to fulfil certain public duties until shortly before his death on 6 May 1938, at Chatsworth. On 9 May he was buried at Edensor church.<br>
