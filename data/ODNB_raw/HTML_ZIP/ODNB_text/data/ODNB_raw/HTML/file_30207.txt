<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yearsley,  James</span>  (1805&#150;1869), <span class="occ">ear surgeon</span>, was born at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the son of Moses Yearsley (<i>b</i>. 1776) and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1848). The family originated from the north country. In 1822 he became apprenticed to Ralph Fletcher of Gloucester, a skilled surgeon and collector of pictures. Yearsley became a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1824, and qualified in 1827 with the diploma of membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, and as a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. Later in life he added to these qualifications the licentiateship of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh (1860), and graduated MD at St Andrews University in 1862. After practising for a short time in Cheltenham, he established himself about 1829 as a general practitioner at Ross in Herefordshire. Deciding that this was not to be his future, he studied diseases of the ear in Paris before returning to London in 1837. Here at 15 Savile Row he began to practise as an aural surgeon. In 1838 he founded the Institution for Curing Diseases of the Ear, later the Metropolitan Ear Institution, at 29 Sackville Street, Piccadilly, and in 1846 he became surgeon to the Royal Society of Musicians. The Metropolitan Ear Institution was subsequently renamed the Metropolitan Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, the first of its kind in the world.<br>
<br>Yearsley appreciated the influence of conditions of the nose and throat on the ear. In his book <span class="italic">Improved Methods of Treating Diseases of the Ear</span> (1840), he states: &#145;Almost all diseases of the ear originate in a morbid condition of the mucous membrane of the throat, nose and ear&#146;. Yearsley also observed that he &#145;suspected an overlapping of the mouths of the Eustachian tubes by the loose mucous membrane&#146;, and that &#145;shortly after excision of a small slip of mucous membrane from underneath the arches of the palate, amendment more or less considerable (in hearing) had taken place&#146;. He was thus close to the discovery of the adenoid, which was made by Hans Wilhelm Meyer (1824&#150;1895) of Copenhagen in 1868. <span class="italic">Contributions to Aural Surgery</span> followed in 1841, and in the same year Yearsley published a book on stammering, in which he advocated the use of tonsillectomy, performed with a curved bistoury, as a cure. This claim produced notoriety and was subsequently found to be fallacious. Yearsley later shrewdly confined this operation to cases of deafness due to Eustachian tube obstruction, and endorsed this indication by writing <span class="italic">A Treatise on Enlarged Tonsils</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">On Throat Deafness</span> (1853).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> of 1 July 1848 Yearsley published an account of his &#145;artificial tympanum&#146;, a small pellet of thin, wet cotton wool placed daily over a dry perforation of the ear drum. He justifiably claimed to be the originator of the artificial tympanum, as Joseph Toynbee did not publish his quite different technique, using a disc of vulcanized indiarubber attached to a fine silver wire, until 1853. There was nevertheless an unfortunate war of words, which persisted with unseemly bitterness, and was later much regretted by both of them. Yearsley returned to the ear with the publication of <span class="italic">Deafness Practically Illustrated</span> (1854). Throughout his working life he advocated the use of the Eustachian catheter.<br>
<br>Yearsley, with Tyler Smith and Forbes Winslow, founded in 1845 the <span class="italic">Medical Directory</span>, which, by recording the names of all recognized practitioners, was an important step towards the <span class="roman">Medical Registration Act</span> of 1858. Yearsley was the originator and proprietor (though not editor) of the <span class="italic">Medical Circular</span> (1852), which in 1866 was incorporated with the <span class="italic">Dublin Medical Press</span> (1839), founded by Sir William Wilde as <span class="italic">The Medical Press Circular</span>. This journal was said not to have achieved its full potential because Yearsley had not correctly judged the mood of the day and relied on a previously popular aggressive approach which was no longer in vogue. He tended to respond to criticism with impatience and intolerance.<br>
<br>Yearsley married Hanna Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1879), one of Ralph Fletcher's daughters, and they had three children. While not having the scientific background of Toynbee, Yearsley is remembered as perhaps the first clinician to practise as an ear, nose, and throat specialist. He died of cancer of the liver on 9 July 1869 at his home in 15 Savile Row, London, and was buried on the 14th in the churchyard at Sutton Bonington, Nottinghamshire, where his eldest son, Ralph, was rector. Yearsley's memory is perpetuated in the annual Yearsley lecture, now held at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, as part of the annual meeting of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists.<br>
