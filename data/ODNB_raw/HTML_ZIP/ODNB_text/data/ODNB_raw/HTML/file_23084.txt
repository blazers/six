<span class="headword">Ramsay,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Sir James Ramsay; <em>called </em>Black Ramsay]</span>  (1589?&#150;1638/9), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland probably in 1589. He was the eighth of nine children of Robert Ramsay of Wyliecleuch, known as Sir Robert; a brother was the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23079/', "David Ramsay")</script> and he was a kinsman of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23091/', "John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington and earl of Holdernesse")</script>. In later life he became known as Black Ramsay to distinguish him from another James Ramsay in Swedish service at the time called the Fair. He is generally styled Sir James, though on what basis is not known.<br>
<br>James Ramsay accompanied King James to London in 1603, where he became an attendant in the privy chamber of the king and of Prince Henry. He is probably the same as the James Ramsay who was recommended for service at the court of Christian IV of Denmark&#150;Norway by James VI and I in the first decade of the seventeenth century. In 1611 Ramsay was sent back to the Stuart kingdoms to levy recruits for the impending Kalmar War between Denmark&#150;Norway and Sweden. However, he did not remain long in Danish service as in 1614 the Swedish chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, entrusted a messenger known as Ramsay with carrying a letter to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26142/', "Colonel James Spens")</script>, the Stuart ambassador to Sweden and Swedish ambassador to the Stuarts. Some time before 1614 Ramsay married Isobel Spens (<i>d</i>. after 1646), the ambassador's daughter. Little more is known of him during the next decade apart from his appointment as an ensign in the Swedish army in 1615. Ramsay next appears as a lieutenant-colonel in Colonel Spens's regiment from 1624 to 1626. The following year he became the colonel of his own recruited regiment of Scots.<br>
<br>Ramsay and his regiment were frequently considered by Oxenstierna and King Gustavus Adolphus for the Swedish campaigns in Germany during the Thirty Years' War. By 1630 Ramsay's regiment had suffered such a high mortality rate that Oxenstierna authorized the provision of new recruits from Courland, Lithuania, and Scotland. The Swedish chancellor was also quick to rectify Ramsay's shortage of funds for his troops, and wrote directly to the treasurer to release money to him. When the marquess of Hamilton's troops landed in Germany in 1631 Ramsay ensured the delivery of victuals to the starving and sickly men. In March 1631 Oxenstierna even recommended Ramsay as the only officer suitable to take over the occupation of Colberg with his regiment of 600 soldiers, revealing the high esteem he had for Ramsay's military leadership.<br>
<br>At the battle of Breitenfeld near Leipzig in September 1631 Ramsay's troops served in the vanguard whose actions helped bring victory to the Swedes, alongside those of Colonel Robert Monro of Foulis and Sir John Hamilton. Soon afterwards Ramsay's regiment was instrumental in forcing the fortified castle at W&uuml;rzburg to surrender after the city had already capitulated to the Swedish king through the mediation of a Scottish priest named Ogilvie. During the manoeuvre Ramsay was incapacitated by a wound in the arm. Not only was he rewarded with a large land grant in the duchy of Mecklenburg, but he was also appointed the governor of Hanau. His regiment continued to undertake leading roles in Swedish army manoeuvres, such as the taking of Aschaffenberg, Oppenheim, and Creuznach. Shortly after this Ramsay's wife must have decided to leave Germany as in 1632 Oxenstierna requested that money be released for her removal along with her household to Stettin. Ramsay's favourable reputation was widespread and in 1634 the burgesses and town council of Nuremberg personally requested his appointment as commandant of their town upon the death of the former incumbent, Colonel Hastfer. Chancellor Oxenstierna had to refuse the request as Ramsay was still serving in Hanau. That year the Stuart ambassador to Poland, Sir George Douglas, visited Ramsay. During this period Ramsay was promoted major-general.<br>
<br>However, Ramsay's fortunes soon changed as imperial forces began to besiege Hanau in 1635, and the garrison barely survived until the following year when Swedish forces, led by Colonel Alexander Leslie, liberated the town. After a brief respite, during which Ramsay managed to send provisions to another garrison nearby, Hanau was again besieged and this time Philip Maurice, count of Hanau, made his peace with the emperor, and relinquished the Swedish cause. Seeing the impossibility of his situation, Ramsay agreed to evacuate the city on honourable terms. Oxenstierna wrote Ramsay a letter commending and congratulating him on his steadfast performance at Hanau, allowing him to retain his rank until he received full payment and compensation from the Swedish government to the value of 50,000 riksdaler (about &pound;15,000). This was to cover several arrangements: to maintain his wife in Scotland, to secure an equivalent for his lands in Mecklenburg, and to obtain his safe conduct to Swedish quarters. However, Ramsay did not believe that this agreement would be honoured and in December 1637, to put pressure on the Swedes who would not want to give the Germans further cause to attack, he took the count of Hanau prisoner and re-occupied the town. Barely two months later, on 12 February 1638, Henry, Count Nassau Dillenburg, surprised, wounded, and captured Ramsay, who died a prisoner in the castle of Dillenburg on either 11 March 1638 or, according to T. Fischer, 29 June 1639. His widow lacked the means to bring his body back to Scotland and he was eventually buried at Dillenburg town church on 18 August 1650.<br>
<br>It is not known how many children Ramsay had, although a son, David, attained the rank of colonel in the Swedish service (his will is printed by Fischer, <span class="italic">Scots in Sweden</span>). Although Ramsay, unlike so many of his compatriots serving in the Swedish army, was never ennobled by the Swedes, he still proved a respectable and consistent soldier of the highest calibre, to the extent that he was actively sought after as governor by conquered German populations.<br>
