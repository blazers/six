<span class="headword">Lupset,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1530), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and scholar</span>, was the son of Thomas Lupset, member of the Company of Goldsmiths and moneylender, and his wife, Alice, and was born probably in St Mildred's parish, London. Before 1508 he entered John Colet's household. On 24 October 1508 he received from the king the chapel of St Margaret, Hilborough, Norfolk, probably on Colet's recommendation. Lupset studied Greek and Latin under William Lily, probably at St Paul's School. By mid-1513 he was at Cambridge, probably in Pembroke College, when he assisted Erasmus in editing the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Despite this early prominence, Lupset disappears until three years later when he was in London, enmeshed in difficulties with Erasmus over his revelation of the alleged authorship of <span class="italic">Julius exclusus</span> (now thought not to be by Erasmus), a manuscript (apparently autograph) of which Lupset had in his possession. By the same time he had come to know Thomas More, to whom he passed this manuscript and several others written by Erasmus. <br>
<br>In early 1517 Lupset went to Paris in order to see through the press Thomas Linacre's translation of Galen's <span class="italic">De sanitate tuenda</span>. He sought Guillaume Bud&eacute;'s criticism of the manuscript, and after its printing Erasmus repeatedly asked Lupset to send him a copy. Having produced Linacre's book, Lupset also saw More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span> into print. Among the prefatory material was a letter from Bud&eacute; to Lupset. Another such letter prefaced the 1519 Paris edition of Galen's <span class="italic">Methodus medendi</span>. In addition to men of the stature of More and Bud&eacute;, Lupset was already known to Richard Pace, the king's secretary. During a quick visit to Louvain, Lupset met Edward Lee, then deeply embroiled in an attack on Erasmus's <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, a text which Lupset vehemently supported. Lupset tried to talk Lee out of publishing his most intemperate criticisms by telling him that a young man (Lee) should not contend with an old one (Erasmus). In December 1519 Erasmus wrote Lupset a long letter defending his work. Early the following year, Lupset contributed three of his own letters, and two of More's, to <span class="italic">Epistolae aliquot eruditorum, nunquam antehac excusae</span> (published by Thierry Martens in December 1519 and by Froben in 1520) which attacked Lee. Lupset responded to Lee's charge that he was largely responsible for the &#145;tragedy&#146;, although it is unknown what may have lain behind Lee's criticism. The sum of Lupset's sometimes thinly supported argument fell on Lee's lack of principles and his poor scholarship, although Lupset's letter to Wilhelm Nesen made some points in detail, along with the accusation that Lee was insane. The <span class="italic">Epistolae</span> went through three editions, helping to make Lupset's reputation.<br>
<br>Lupset returned to England by late 1519 or early 1520. Shortly before that Colet had died, leaving books to Lupset. Erasmus asked Lupset for information about Colet in order to write a remembrance which became his letter to Justus Jonas of 13 June 1521, but Lupset apparently did not provide very much material&#151;at least Erasmus's text contains little concrete biographical detail. In early 1520 Lupset took up residence in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, when he was identified as BA (Emden says of Paris, Gee of Oxford), and was made lecturer in rhetoric and humanity by Cardinal Wolsey's appointment. More, Lupset's first biographer George Lily, and the University of Oxford all highly praised Lupset's efforts. He had among his students the subsequently prominent translator Gentian Hervet, but Hervet's chronology is sufficiently confused to make it difficult to say when. Lupset incepted as MA on 9 July 1521. Lily's statement that Lupset left Oxford because he could not compete with his successor as lecturer, Juan Luis Vives, may be disproved by chronology: Lupset had left Oxford before Vives's appointment.<h2>
<a name="Italy"></a>Italy</h2>On 31 January 1522 Lupset received a royal grant of a pension from the abbot of St Mary's, York, and a little later the living of Ashton, Derbyshire. By March 1523 he had vacated the rectory of Claypole, Lincolnshire, and on the 24th of that month became chaplain of St Nicholas's Chapel in the parish of Stanford-le-Hope, Essex (until death). Probably already before these last transactions, Lupset had left Oxford for Padua, very likely in company with Thomas Starkey. He carried recommendations to Niccol&ograve; Leonico Tomeo from William Latimer and Cuthbert Tunstall. Once arrived, Lupset immediately encountered Reginald Pole, whom he may have known from Oxford and in whose household he probably lived. With Pole he shared instruction from Leonico, and Leonico asked both to look over the preface to his <span class="italic">Dialogi</span> published in 1524. In early 1525 Lupset was in Venice, whence he kept Leonico minutely informed about the campaign leading to the battle of Pavia, sending him a map. Later that year Lupset introduced Pole to Erasmus in a long epistolary encomium dated 23 August 1525. He provided Erasmus with manuscripts, among them one of Chrysostom, perhaps of his commentary on <span class="roman">Acts</span>. Possibly through Pole's patronage Lupset received the rectory of Great Mongeham, Kent, on 21 April 1526 (vacated by July 1530; it went next to Pole's client Starkey). At the same time he became rector of Snargate, Kent, and St Martin Ludgate on 3 July 1526 (until death).<br>
<br>While in Italy, Lupset became close to Pace, ambassador to Venice, with whom he spent much time both there and in Padua, although he probably did not act as Pace's secretary as Anthony Wood thought. Lupset was among four Englishmen who received special credit for preparing the Aldine edition of Galen which appeared in five volumes in 1525. In early 1526 Lupset went to Paris for unknown reasons, returning to Padua whence he set out for England with Pole in the autumn, making another stop in Paris which probably extended into 1527. On his return to England, Lupset hoped to devote himself to sacred literature, especially Chrysostom, but Wolsey appointed him tutor to his illegitimate son Thomas Winter, who was being sent to Paris. Lupset arrived there before 28 February 1528, the date of his first letter thence. Either before or after this episode, Lupset tutored Edmund Withypoll, son of Paul Withypoll, an alderman of London, along with Christopher Smith. He may also have been close to John Leland, who addressed three poems to Lupset. Lupset ended his tutelage of Winter in 1529, and Wolsey apparently recalled him, perhaps intending to employ him in his new college in Oxford.<h2>
<a name="Aburstofwriting"></a>A burst of writing</h2>That summer, in Wolsey's palace of the More, Lupset wrote his <span class="italic">Exhortacion to Young Men</span>, addressed to Withypoll and printed by 24 August 1529. It began with a complaint about Lupset's enforced attendance on Wolsey, and urged Withypoll to attend to his soul first, his body next, and worldly possessions only last. Lupset offered Withypoll a short list of essential reading, beginning with the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, to be read according to the church's interpretation, which Lupset seems to have thought meant Chrysostom and Jerome, a less than orthodox pairing. He added Aristotle's <span class="italic">Ethics</span>, Plato, Cicero, Seneca (who appears in all three works), Erasmus's <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span>, Galen, and lastly Aristotle's <span class="italic">Politics</span>. The <span class="italic">Exhortacion</span> has been called the most polished piece of English prose written to this time. It was likely at more or less the same moment that Lupset produced <span class="italic">A Treatise of Charitie</span>, first published in 1533 and intended for the use of a nun. It begins with a definition of charity which Lupset made equivalent to all of Christianity, and argued the Stoic point that tranquillity of mind was its &#145;chief effect&#146;  (Gee, 228). Towards the end of the work, Lupset criticized William Tyndale's translation of the Latin <i>charitas</i> as &#145;love&#146; in his <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, just as More had done. Lupset also argued the somewhat peculiar point that faith led to fear of God which issued in works of charity. Charity meant unconditional love of one's neighbour for God's sake, and Lupset concluded that &#145;both God is charity and charity is God&#146;  (Gee, 231). In this treatise, as in all his other writings, Lupset stressed the necessity of contempt of the body and of this life. All three also have an anti-clerical edge.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1529 Lupset may have visited Pole at his mother's house at Bisham, an occasion which could have given rise to Starkey's <span class="italic">Dialogue between Pole and Lupset</span>, a work nurtured when Starkey and Lupset were together in Paris immediately afterwards. It is possible that the efforts of Lupset, the character in the <span class="italic">Dialogue</span>, to induce Pole actively to serve the commonwealth were undertaken on behalf of the king. The real Lupset certainly expected great things of Pole, as the praise of him towards the end of <span class="italic">A Compendious Treatise of &hellip; Dieyng Well</span> manifests by stressing England's hopes for Pole. The work's point is simple and in line with Lupset's other two original compositions: a good death required contempt of this life. It opened with a lengthy treatment of the Roman Canius who laughed at a death sentence from Emperor Caligula, and included a much briefer list of Christian martyrs. Lupset admitted that he could not do the job on the subject that a Carthusian might, and his stress on the &#145;paynims&#146; confirms his judgment.<br>
<br>Whatever his thoughts on the future life, for the moment Lupset attached his career prospects to Pole in preference to Wolsey. In October 1529 Pole left England for Paris, allegedly to continue his studies, but this was a pretence to cover his mission on Henry's behalf to the theologians and lawyers of the University of Paris. Lily repeated the pretence but also correctly observed that Lupset had joined Pole at a time when he stood in &#145;the king's high favor&#146;  (Hirsh, 16). Lupset almost certainly accompanied Pole on the evidence both of a list of instructions from Pole to him concerning a trip to Paris, and the fact that Lupset's last work, <span class="italic">Dieyng Well</span>, directed to Pole's servant John Walker, was finished in Paris by 10 January of what must be 1530. In any case, Lupset certainly took part in Pole's procuring of a favourable opinion on the king's divorce from both faculties. In the later stages of the negotiations he acted as messenger to and from Pole. At the end of April he received 100 crowns from the king and in May another &pound;10 &#145;by way of reward&#146;  (Gee, 139), as well as the rectory of Cheriton, Hampshire, on 1 August 1530, and a canonry of Salisbury and the prebend of Ruscombe Southbury five days later, very likely through royal (or at least Wolsey's) patronage.<br>
<br>Like Pole himself, Lupset was able to compartmentalize his attitude to royal service and to royal policy. At nearly the same time as he performed well in Paris, he also wrote his neo-Stoic works, and translated Chrysostom (and according to Lily wrote imitations of his sermons), as well as a work, now lost, criticizing the formulation of policy during drunken spells in the royal palace, which may have owed something to Pseudo-Dionysius's <span class="italic">Celestial Hierarchies</span>, and must certainly have been meant as criticism of Henry VIII. Its only manuscript was burnt in 1538 during the investigation of the Courtenay conspiracy. Lupset also claimed in the <span class="italic">Exhortacion</span> to have retranslated Xenophon's <span class="italic">Oeconomia</span> since &#145;Raphael's&#146; translation was so poor, but the only new version known appeared under Hervet's name from Berthelet's press in 1532. Lupset also intended to English Simplicius's commentary on Epictetus's <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span>.<br>
<br>Lupset probably accompanied Pole back to England in late summer 1530, but died in his mother's house of tuberculosis on 27 December. He was buried in St Alfege Cripplegate, under the inscription &#145;Hic situs est Thomas Lupsetus vir Graece et Latine, atque in sacris literis eruditissimus&#146; (&#145;here lies Thomas Lupset, a man most learned in Greek and Latin, as well as in theology&#146;). Some of his manuscripts passed to Pole. Lily correctly summarized Lupset's position at his death as much in Henry's eye. The first collected edition of Lupset's works appeared in 1546 and was reprinted in 1560. In addition, he translated one of Chrysostom's sermons and probably Colet's convocation sermon.<br>
