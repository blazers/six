<span class="headword">Eorcenberht</span>  (<em>d.</em> 664), <span class="occ">king of Kent</span>, was the son of his predecessor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8375/', "Eadbald (d. 640)")</script> and Ymmae, or Emma (<i>d</i>. 642), who may have been the daughter of a powerful Frankish aristocrat named Erchinoald. The first element of Eorcenberht's name is Frankish (it is identical to that of Erchinoald), and he gave Frankish names to his second son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39262/', "Hlothhere")</script>, and to his daughters, Eormenhild and Eorcengota (he sent the latter across the channel to be a nun in the monastery of Faremoutiers, near Meaux). Eorcenberht succeeded his father in 640 and was the first English king to order the destruction of pagan idols in his kingdom; he also used his royal authority to enforce the keeping of the Lenten fast in Kent. Little is known of the secular events of the reign, apart from a series of marriage alliances with other royal families. Eorcenberht himself married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25150/', "Seaxburh (d. c.700)")</script>, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39123/', "King Anna of the East Angles")</script>, and their daughter Eormenhild became the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30093/', "King Wulfhere of Mercia")</script>. In addition, the powerful King Oswiu of Northumbria married Eorcenberht's first cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8392/', "Eanfl&#230;d")</script>, who had been brought up in Kent and with whom he was on good terms. This network of alliances may have afforded Kent some protection against aggressors. Eorcenberht died on 14 July 664, the same day as Deusdedit, archbishop of Canterbury; it is possible that both were victims of the great plague which swept Britain and Ireland in that year. Eorcenberht was probably buried alongside his father in St Mary's Church in the monastery of St Peter's and St Paul's (later St Augustine's), Canterbury. His widow, Seaxburh, eventually became abbess of the monastery at Ely, founded by her sister &AElig;thelthryth; Kentish tradition also connects her with the foundation of Minster in Sheppey.<br>
<br>Eorcenberht's successor was his son <a name="cosubject_54039"></a><span class="headword">Ecgberht I</span>  (<em>d.</em> 673). Later hagiographical texts, which may preserve some genuine historical information, mention that Eorcenberht had a brother named Eormenred (another Frankish name) and describe him as king; he may have ruled jointly with Eorcenberht (although Bede does not mention him), or he may perhaps have acted as an under-king. Eormenred is said to have died before Eorcenberht, leaving to his brother's care his two sons, &AElig;thelberht and &AElig;thelred. After Eorcenberht's own death, Ecgberht arranged for the murder of his cousins, presumably to secure his own position. Later, as compensation for his blood-guilt, he gave land to their sister &AElig;bba (or Domneva), which she used to found a monastery in Thanet. In 669 the minster at Reculver was established by Ecgberht's mass priest Bassa on land granted to him by the king. Ecgberht also seems to have been involved in the foundation of the minster at Chertsey in Surrey, which is an indication that his power extended, at least for a short time, beyond the frontiers of Kent. Ecgberht died in July 673. Although his two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52302/', "Eadric (d. 686)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39262/', "Hlothhere")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29381/', "Wihtred (d. 725)")</script>, were passed over initially and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39262/', "Hlothhere (d. 685)")</script> succeeded him, they did become kings later.<br>
