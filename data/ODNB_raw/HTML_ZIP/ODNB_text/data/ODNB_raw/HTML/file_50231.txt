<span class="headword">Cecily <span class="st"> [Cicely; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>n&eacute;e </em>Cecily Neville]</span>, duchess of York  (1415&#150;1495), <span class="occ">Yorkist matriarch</span>, was born on 3 May 1415, eighteenth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland (c.1364&#150;1425)")</script>, and the tenth from his second marriage, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53026/', "Joan Beaufort (d. 1440)")</script>. Some time before 18 October 1424 she was betrothed to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23503/', "Richard, duke of York")</script>, Neville's ward, and they married shortly before October 1429. This was one among what has been described as &#145;the most amazing series of child marriages in English history&#146;  (Lander, 121), designed to forge a network of aristocratic alliances. Between 1439 and 1452 Cecily gave birth to twelve children, of whom only six survived infancy. The first, Anne, and the last, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23500/', "Richard III")</script>, were born at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, which appears to have been her favourite residence. Another daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18051/', "Margaret, duchess of Burgundy")</script>, may also have been born there. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8520/', "Edward of March (later Edward IV)")</script> and Edmund of Rutland were born at Rouen, while their father was governor of France, Elizabeth, who married John de la Pole, second duke of Suffolk, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10542/', "George, future duke of Clarence")</script>, at Dublin, while Duke Richard was lieutenant of Ireland. In 1441 her husband made provision for her, granting her Marshwood, Dorset, Bisley, Gloucestershire, and Pirbright, Surrey, and nine properties in East Anglia; this was probably part of a more comprehensive settlement. On Richard's attainder in 1459 manors worth 1000 marks p.a. were assigned to her, and in June 1461 Edward IV granted her property worth 5000 marks p.a. in recompense for her jointure lands, and probably also gave her an annuity of &pound;107 17<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. In 1486 Henry VII ordered the payment of arrears, and also renewed her licence to export 250&frac12; sacks of wool. Thus, throughout the political vicissitudes in which Cecily's husband and sons were the central figures, her financial security was guaranteed.<br>
<br>As the crisis developed in the 1450s, the fragility of the great marriage network became apparent. Even Cecily's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19954/', "Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury")</script>, was prominent among the supporters of Henry VI against York at Dartford in late February 1452. During this decade Cecily had no need to take a high-profile role akin to that of Margaret of Anjou, but when the conflict became open she could not avoid involvement. After Richard's flight from the &#145;rout of Ludford&#146; in October 1459 she was captured by Lancastrian troops, and when her husband was attainted at the Coventry parliament in November, she apparently threw herself on Henry VI's mercy and intervened successfully for many of her people. She was assigned to the custody of her sister Anne, duchess of Buckingham. In late September 1460 she left London, where she was temporarily resident in John Paston's house rather than the Yorks' home at Baynard's Castle, to meet her husband on his return from Ireland, and the ceremonial nature of their reunion perhaps foreshadowed his ambitions for the throne. These were thwarted by his defeat and death at the battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460. Cecily sent her two youngest sons to safety in Utrecht, but herself remained in London, where she must have felt extremely vulnerable after Queen Margaret's victory at the second battle of St Albans on 16 February 1461; but in the event eleven days later London opened its gates to the earl of Warwick and Cecily's son Edward, who on 4 March was recognized as king.<br>
<br>For the next twenty-four years, save for brief periods in 1470&#150;71 and 1483, Cecily was mother of the reigning sovereign. In 1461 the papal legate was advised to communicate quickly with her, because of her great influence over her son. This, however, can seldom be documented. Her disapproval of Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8634/', "Elizabeth (c.1437&#150;1492)")</script>] was probably indicated by her absence from the new queen's coronation, on 26 May 1465. Later stories that in June 1469 she went to Sandwich to attempt to dissuade George of Clarence from rising with Warwick against Edward, and that as late as March 1470 she tried to reconcile the two brothers in a meeting at Baynard's Castle, may be apocryphal in their details, while still reflecting reality in showing Cecily as responsive to the extreme danger of division within the Yorkist family. It was now that the rumour of Edward IV's illegitimacy, due to his mother's adultery, was first circulated for political reasons. It re-emerged in 1483, when Richard of Gloucester began his attempt to wrest the crown from his young nephew. Mancini blames Richard for the calumny, and Vergil records that Cecily complained loud and long of the injury he had done her, but his campaign for the throne was launched from his mother's London house. Even after Richard III's death honourable provision was made for her by Henry VII, for she was the grandmother of his queen consort.<br>
<br>Because of the survival of her detailed will, made at Berkhamsted on 31 May 1495, a few days before her death, and also of a household ordinance book dating from after 1485, Cecily has been taken as a prime exemplar of late medieval female aristocratic piety. These sources document the dedicated regime of literate and ascetic piety practised by an old lady, but against this must be set the ostentatious dynastic religiosity displayed in the reburial of her husband's body at Fotheringhay in 1476, in the planning of which she surely played a part. The scene of her devotions was a lavishly decorated chapel, but her domestic religion was formulated by monastic precept. Her reading included the visions of Mathilde von Hackeborn, a thirteenth-century German Cistercian, the life of St Catherine of Siena, and the <span class="italic">Revelations</span> of St Bridget of Sweden&#151;a clear indication of a common European religious culture. Her personal contact with the scriptures was made through Nicholas Love's translation of St Bonaventure's <span class="italic">Mirror of the Life of Blessed Jesu Christ</span>. One of her granddaughters was prioress of the Bridgettines of Syon, another a Dominican nun of Dartford, and she passed on her practical piety to her daughter Margaret, duchess of Burgundy, and, as is increasingly recognized, to Richard III.<br>
<br>Cecily's religion was, however, essentially conservative compared to that of her cousin, Lady Margaret Beaufort, in that she felt no compulsion to educational endowment as a means of strengthening the faith. Perhaps most revealing is her reading of Walter Hilton's <span class="italic">Epistle on the Mixed Life</span>, an exhortation to contemplation by those necessarily involved in worldly concerns; and most evocative is her bequest to Henry VII of an arras depicting the wheel of fortune, whose revolutions she had experienced so dramatically during her long life. She was buried at Fotheringhay, beside her husband, with a papal indulgence hung round her neck.<br>
