<span class="headword">Leslie, Sir  Walter</span>, lord of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1382), <span class="occ">soldier and royal retainer</span>, was a younger son of Sir Andrew Leslie, lord of Leslie (<i>d</i>. 1320&times;24), and Mary Abernethy (<i>d</i>. in or before 1355), daughter and heir of Sir Alexander Abernethy of that ilk. He had two elder brothers, Andrew and Norman, and two younger half-brothers, Alexander and William Lindsay, from his mother's marriage to her second husband, Sir David Lindsay of Crawford. Walter seems to have started his career as an esquire in the household of his kinsman Thomas Stewart, earl of Angus, but by the end of the 1350s, having been knighted between 23 October 1357 and 24 October 1358, he had joined his brother Norman in the service of David II. Like many of David II's favoured retainers, Walter and Norman Leslie were active crusaders, obtaining numerous safe conducts for expeditions to the Holy Land and the Baltic crusades. Walter's exploits were commemorated in the Saracen's head crest adorning his coat of arms in the late fourteenth-century &#145;Armorial de Gelres&#146; and may well have provided the inspiration for a now lost vernacular work, &#145;The Tail of Syr Valtir the Bald Leslye&#146;. In 1363&#150;5 Walter and Norman, possibly at the instigation of David II, seem to have been involved in the crusade organized by Pierre I of Cyprus which ended in the sack of Alexandria (where Norman Leslie may have been killed).<br>
<br>On Walter Leslie's return to Scotland he was the beneficiary of considerable royal favour. Before 13 September 1366 David II forced through the marriage of his favourite to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54312/', "Euphemia Ross")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54308/', "Ross family")</script>], daughter and heir of William, earl of Ross, despite the earl's opposition to the match. Then in February 1370 he granted the royal thanages of Kincardine, Aberluthnott, Fettercairn, and Aberchirder to Walter and Euphemia and their heirs. In October of the same year, moreover, the king intimidated Ross into a formal entailing of his earldom in favour of Walter and Euphemia. Overall, David II apparently viewed Leslie as a dependable and forceful agent for the interests and authority of the crown in the north of the kingdom. The death of his royal patron in February 1371, and the fact that David's successor, Robert II, was the brother-in-law of the earl of Ross, brought about a decline in Leslie's political influence. A fairly regular witness to David's later charters, he no longer witnessed royal charters after 1371. Despite this, King Robert allowed him to retain all the crown lands granted to him in the 1360s and failed to take any action over a complaint delivered to him in June 1371 by the earl of Ross, detailing King David's unfair treatment of the earl and his brother and the resultant resignation of land and title in favour of Leslie.<br>
<br>After Ross's death on 9 February 1372 Leslie adopted the courtesy title lord of Ross as the husband of the earl's daughter and heir, although his influence within the earldom may well have been limited by the opposition of local lords and kindreds, particularly the male line descended from the earl's brother Hugh. In addition, the earldom of Ross was one of the areas made subject to the authority of Robert II's son Alexander Stewart, lord of Badenoch, when he was appointed the king's lieutenant in the north in October 1372. Leslie seems to have continued his career as a crusader and mercenary after 1372 and obtained a succession of English safe conducts for travel overseas. He died at Perth on 27 February 1382; his widow, Euphemia, married Alexander Stewart, but this liaison ended in a politically inspired divorce in 1392.<br>
<br>Leslie and his wife had at least two children, Alexander and Mary. Alexander Leslie became earl of Ross and married Isabel Stewart, daughter of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany, brother of Robert III. Alexander died on 8 May 1402, leaving a daughter and heir, Euphemia, who in 1415 resigned her rights in the earldom in favour of Albany's son John Stewart. Euphemia Leslie seems to have died unmarried and childless after her resignation. Mary Leslie married Donald, lord of the Isles, and after her brother's death Donald of the Isles claimed the earldom of Ross in right of his wife. The son of Donald and Mary, Alexander, eventually had his claim to Ross recognized by the crown, and the earldom remained with the lords of the Isles until it was forfeited to James III in 1478.<br>
