<span class="headword">Hanbury,  John</span>  (1700&#150;1758), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born at Llanfihangel, Monmouthshire, on 15 August 1700, the son of Charles Hanbury (1677&#150;1735) of Pant-teg, and his wife, Grace (<i>d</i>. 1710), widow of Jenkinson Beadles. The Hanbury family had been active in the Society of Friends from his grandfather's time. Although John's active career was spent almost entirely in London, there are no surviving records of an apprenticeship there or of his admission to a livery company. He first appears as an independent trader in London about 1724, suggesting that he had spent the immediately preceding years away from London, most likely as a factor in the Chesapeake for an English merchant. He soon became conspicuously active in the London tobacco import trade, ranking second in 1729&#150;31, and first by 1747. His Virginia business was primarily that of a commission merchant, receiving from planters consignments of tobacco for sale, and returning cargoes of manufactures and other goods as ordered. His Maryland business, by contrast, involved substantial dealings with local independent merchants. In both trades he reduced costs and risks by sending out relatively few vessels of his own, depending instead on chartering as needed. To superintend the frequent adjustments needed, he employed a principal agent in each colony with broad powers to charter shipping.<br>
<br>Hanbury's Virginia and Maryland correspondents included planters from the most prominent local families. To attract such a clientele he was expected to provide political as well as the usual commercial services. By the 1740s he was a key player in the competition to influence appointments to desirable public positions in both colonies. In Maryland he was very close to Lord Baltimore, whom he served as &#145;banker&#146;, and in Virginia to Lieutenant-Governor Gooch, whose executor he became. He was also reportedly on excellent terms with all the major figures in the Pelham and Newcastle ministries. Through his access to Lord Granville, lord president of the council, he was able to deflect British legislation requiring loyalty oaths that would have excluded Pennsylvania Quakers from public office. When the issue became pressing at the start of the Seven Years' War, Hanbury negotiated the compromise under which Quakers withdrew from the Pennsylvania legislature during the war but retained their rights to future membership.<br>
<br>In 1747 Hanbury took in as partner his cousin Capel Hanbury (<i>d</i>. 1769), son of a Bristol soap maker. Both partners had numerous acquaintances in Bristol and were able to cultivate a political interest there. John Hanbury particularly pleased the duke of Newcastle by soliciting votes and guaranteeing funds for the election in 1754 of Robert Nugent as member for Bristol. Hanbury's closeness to the ministry became controversial at the time of Braddock's expedition the next year. In 1747 the local planters and merchants organizing the Ohio Company of Virginia had asked Hanbury to take a share in the company and act as its London agent. As such, he was consulted by both Henry Pelham and the duke of Newcastle on the French military challenge in North America. He also contracted to pay and victual Braddock's troops; in this work his agents and the warehouses of the Ohio Company were utilized. When the expedition ended in disaster, Dr John Shebbeare and other anti-ministerial publicists tried to depict John Hanbury as the hypocritical and self-serving Quaker mastermind behind the ill-fated strategy. In fact, from 1726 Hanbury had been the member of the Quakers' meeting for sufferings, responsible for correspondence with Virginia and Maryland. Even so, he attracted unfavourable comment from more strictly pacifist Friends for arming his ships in wartime and for investing in privateers in the 1740s.<br>
<br>This John Hanbury, usually termed of Tower Street, must be distinguished from several namesakes, including Major John Hanbury of Pontypool (1664?&#150;1734), ironmaster and MP, and John Hanbury (1671&#150;1732), governor of the Hamburg Company and subgovernor of the South Sea Company. In 1728 John Hanbury of Tower Street married Anna Osgood (<i>d</i>. 1754) from a prominent Quaker family originally from Bristol. When he died intestate on 22 June 1758 at Holfield Grange, Coggeshall, Essex, his real estate (primarily in Essex) passed to his only son, <a name="cosubject_53742"></a><span class="headword">Osgood Hanbury</span>  (1731&#150;1784)<span class="occ"></span>, and his personal estate was divided equally between Osgood and his sister, Anna, wife of Thomas Barnard of Kingston, Surrey. She had no children so that, at her death, her share of her father's fortune also went to Osgood's children, including the brewer Sampson Hanbury.<br>
<br>Osgood Hanbury at first continued his father's North American firm in partnership with Capel Hanbury. After the latter's death in 1769, Osgood began to disengage from the now politically exposed Chesapeake trade and thus reduced his ultimate losses from the American War of Independence. In 1757 he married Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37682/', "Sampson Lloyd (1699&#150;1779)")</script> of Birmingham, Quaker iron dealer and banker. During the American War of Independence he compensated in part for the loss of his Chesapeake trade by expanding his West Indies business through the firm of Hanbury and Gosling. In 1770 he had also joined in founding the London bank of Hanbury, Taylor, Lloyd, and Bowman in partnership with his father-in-law. This firm, continued by his descendants for four generations, served as the London correspondents of Taylors and Lloyds, the family's bank in Birmingham, until absorbed in 1884 into what ultimately became the modern Lloyds Bank. Through the marriage of his daughter Anna to Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, bt, brewer and anti-slavery activist, Osgood Hanbury was also the progenitor of the numerous Buxtons and Hanburys who over many generations managed the Truman, Hanbury, and Buxton brewery. He died in 1784.<br>
