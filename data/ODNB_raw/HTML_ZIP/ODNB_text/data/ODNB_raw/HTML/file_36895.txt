<span class="headword">Wilde,  Johannes <span class="st"> [J&aacute;nos]</span></span>  (1891&#150;1970), <span class="occ">art historian</span>, was born in Budapest on 2 June 1891, the sixth and youngest child of Richard Wilde (<i>d</i>. 1912), a tailor, and his wife, Rosa Somlyaky (<i>d</i>. 1928). His parents were devout Roman Catholics who brought him up in an atmosphere of piety and simplicity. He suffered bereavement with the early death of his father and his elder brother Paul, who had greatly influenced him. Educated at the state <i>Gymnasium</i> in Budapest for eight years, he entered the university there in September 1909 to study art, archaeology, and philosophy under Gyula Pasteiner. The summer term of 1911 was spent at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, and, with a scholarship from the Hungarian ministry of education, he continued his studies, under Max Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, at the University of Vienna from October 1915 to July 1917. He was awarded a doctorate in philosophy by Vienna University <i>summa cum laude</i> in July 1918 for his thesis &#145;Die Anf&auml;nge der italienischen Radierung&#146;.<br>
<br>Wilde's first publication, in 1910, was a translation into his native Hungarian of Adolf Hildebrand's <span class="italic">Das Problem der Form in der bildenden Kunst</span>, which is an interesting pointer to his own approach to the visual arts. He was also to gain a reputation as a connoisseur of Hungarian poetry and literature, but his first allegiance was to art, and in August 1914 he became a voluntary assistant at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. After gaining his PhD, he returned to the museum's department of prints and drawings as an assistant keeper under Simon Meller, a post he was to hold until December 1922. Here were laid the foundations of Wilde's interest in connoisseurship and the study of old master drawings. It seems likely that Meller nurtured Wilde's interest in Michelangelo, on whom he had himself published.<br>
<br>During the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, Wilde and Frigves (Friedrich) Antal, among others, were directed by the commissar of public education to sequestrate those privately owned works of art regarded as of national importance. However, in September 1920 Wilde was granted six months' study leave to enable him to accept Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's invitation to lecture at Vienna University. This leave was prolonged to allow Wilde to prepare, in collaboration with Karl Swoboda, an edition of the collected works of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, whose death in February 1921 was a cruel personal loss to Wilde. Too young to succeed Dvo&#345;&aacute;k as professor, Wilde was invited to join the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, in 1923; he accepted Austrian citizenship in 1928.<br>
<br>Despite his demanding museum duties, Wilde continued to lecture and supervise students until the crisis of the <i>Anschluss</i> and his subsequent resignation from the museum for reasons of conscience in November 1938. He had by then decided to leave Austria, impelled largely by fear for the safety of his Hungarian-Jewish wife, Dr Julia Gy&aacute;rf&aacute;s (<i>d</i>. 1970), also an art historian, whom he had married on 6 February 1930. Assisted by a former pupil, Count Antoine Seilern, the couple left Austria ostensibly to visit an exhibition in Holland in April 1939, afterwards flying to England where they were the guests of Kenneth Clark and his wife at Port Lympne. A few months later, at the outbreak of war with Germany, Wilde went to Aberystwyth to look after Seilern's pictures, stored in the university library. At the director's request, he began to assist in cataloguing the National Gallery pictures which were in store there, together with the Italian drawings from the British Museum. This happy coincidence led to his friendship with A. E. Popham, with whom he was later to collaborate in preparing the published catalogue of Italian fifteenth- and sixteenth-century drawings in the Royal Collection (1949). Popham persuaded the British Museum trustees, in June 1940, to invite Wilde to compile the catalogue of the collection's Michelangelo drawings. But in the same month, during the panic caused by the Nazi offensive in France, Wilde was interned. Despite strong protests from English friends, he was deported to Canada and only survived the rigours of the concentration camp through the care of a fellow detainee, Otto Demus.<br>
<br>In May 1941 Wilde was freed and allowed to live in Buckinghamshire as the guest of Count Seilern, who had done much to secure his release. He resumed his Michelangelo studies and began teaching at London University. On 12 March 1947 he had become a British subject, and in 1948 he was appointed reader in the history of art at London University and deputy director of the Courtauld Institute of Art. He officially retired in 1958, although he continued to teach part-time until his seventieth birthday. The title of professor was conferred on him in 1950; he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1951, appointed CBE in 1955, and awarded the Serena medal of the British Academy in 1963.<br>
<br>Wilde gained an international reputation for his work on the Italian, especially the Venetian, paintings at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and his many contributions to the problems of dating, style, attribution, and condition appeared in the 1928 Gem&auml;ldegalerie catalogue and in the Vienna <span class="italic">Jahrbuch</span>. His first major work was the reconstruction of the San Cassiano altarpiece of Antonello da Messina from three surviving fragments in Vienna. One of his most important achievements was the systematic use of X-rays as a tool for discovering not only the physical condition of a picture but also as a guide to the individual artist's creative process. His collaboration with the restorer Sebastian Isepp was crucial to this work, and in 1930 Wilde established at the Kunsthistorisches Museum what was probably the first museum X-ray laboratory for the examination of paintings in Europe. By 1938, more than 1000 X-rays of works in the collection had been made under his supervision.<br>
<br>The study of Michelangelo's art was, however, the most profound intellectual passion of Wilde's life, and his catalogue of the Michelangelo drawings in the British Museum his greatest achievement. Published in 1953, it was supplemented by Wilde's six lectures on Michelangelo (published posthumously in 1978). These lectures skilfully guide the reader, not only through the complexities of Neoplatonism and traditional Christian theology as they shape the subject matter of Michelangelo's major commissions, but also through the even more complex processes by which Michelangelo evolved them. In 1952 Wilde also worked on the Michelangelo drawings in the Teylers Museum, Haarlem, but his catalogue of these has not survived. His impressive lectures on Venetian painting appeared in 1974. It was one of Wilde's fundamental principles to ask not only why a work of art was conceived in a particular way, but also to try to discover the extent to which its original location determined the artist's formal solution.<br>
<br>A tall, sparely built man, Wilde had a grave gentle manner that masked a rigorous intellect and an incorruptible spirit. Those who knew him during his years in England remember his strong jaw and aquiline features, kindly grey eyes behind gold-rimmed spectacles, his silver hair brushed back from a broad forehead. His lectures were delivered with a clear deep voice, in an English enriched by the slow soft drawl of Vienna. Students who may at first have felt in awe of him at tutorials quickly learned of his willingness to share knowledge and give wise counsel, although he could be crushingly ironic on occasion. Kenneth Clark rightly described him as the most beloved and influential teacher of art history of his time. Wilde died at his home, 131 Burbage Road, Dulwich, on 13 September 1970, within three months of his wife's death. They had adopted a son, whom they left behind in Vienna in 1939, and who died during the war. Wilde bequeathed a drawing by Rembrandt, his library, and all his manuscripts and notes to the Courtauld Institute.<br>
