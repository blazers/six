<span class="headword">Mynors, Sir  Roger Aubrey Baskerville</span>  (1903&#150;1989), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 28 July 1903, probably at Langley Burrell, Wiltshire, the eldest of four sons and second of five children of the Revd Aubrey Baskerville Mynors, rector of Langley Burrell, and his wife, Margery Musgrave, daughter of the Revd Charles Musgrave Harvey, prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral. His younger twin, Humphrey Charles Baskerville (1903&#150;1989), later first baronet, to whom he bore a confusing resemblance in earlier years, was to become deputy governor of the Bank of England, a position that had been held by his mother's brother, Sir Ernest Musgrave Harvey, first baronet. He was educated at Eton College (scholar, 1916) and Balliol College, Oxford (exhibitioner, 1922), where he obtained firsts in classical honour moderations (1924) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1926), as well as the Hertford (1924), Craven (1924), and Derby (1926) scholarships.<br>
<br>Mynors was elected a fellow of Balliol in 1926; pupils remember how he introduced them to authors remote from the syllabus. In 1940 he went to the exchange control department of the Treasury as a temporary principal. In 1944 he was elected to the Kennedy chair of Latin at Cambridge, where he became a fellow of Pembroke College, but he never seemed to settle. On 12 December 1945 he married Lavinia Sybil (1911&#150;1994), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30379/', "Very Revd Cyril Argentine Alington")</script>, dean of Durham and formerly his headmaster at Eton, and his wife, Hester Margaret, a daughter of the fourth Baron Lyttelton; it was to prove an ideally happy union. There were no children. His sister-in-law Elizabeth was married to Lord Home of the Hirsel. Lavinia Mynors was a medical researcher and a diarist.<br>
<br>In 1949 Mynors was disappointed not to become master of Balliol, when Sir David Keir was preferred. In 1953 he returned to Oxford as Corpus Christi professor of Latin in succession to Eduard Fraenkel, and he remained at Corpus Christi College until his retirement in 1970.<br>
<br>Mynors's contribution to learning for most of his life centred on Latin manuscripts. He saw them as part of the cultural history of Europe; for him the scribes were not anonymous symbols at the foot of the page, but human beings and friends, who could be placed and dated and sometimes identified. He was a rapid and meticulous collator from an age without microfilms; his apparatus criticus was always elegant and unfussy, like everything else including his handwriting, but he was not assertive enough to offer many conjectures of his own. He edited the <span class="italic">Institutiones</span> of Cassiodorus (1937), Catullus (1958), Pliny's letters (1963), the <span class="italic">Panegyrici Latini</span> (1964), and Virgil (1969). He was a medievalist at least as much as a classical scholar, and he did much to promote Nelson's <span class="roman">Medieval Texts</span>, where he was generous with unobtrusive help to others. He produced catalogues of the manuscripts of Durham Cathedral before 1200, a sumptuous book (1939), and of Balliol College, a conspicuously professional performance (1963). He was a precise and economical translator who contributed much to the Toronto translation of Erasmus (from 1974) and took part in the final revision of the <span class="italic">New English Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Mynors was a fascinating lecturer whom undergraduates flocked to hear, not because he helped them for their examinations but because they found him so interesting. He supervised graduate students by describing his own researches and inspiring them to do likewise. He was a courteous chairman, yet with something in his manner that discouraged time-wasters. He was a delightful letter-writer to his friends, with great sympathy for the young, but did not hurry to reply on matters of business. He was not easy to find, but was there to help when it mattered most. His charm was memorable, but there was a touch of astringency towards the incompetent and self-important, and in spite of his urbanity he showed a diffidence that was not entirely assumed. Though the least didactic of teachers, he could throw off a remark that changed one's approach to the subject, and sensible people followed up his most tentative suggestions.<br>
<br>For many years Mynors occupied himself with a commentary on Virgil's <span class="italic">Georgics</span> that appeared posthumously in 1990. It paid no particular regard to recent periodical articles, or to the fads and fancies of a younger generation of scholars. Instead it showed an expert knowledge of ancient and modern agriculture, a flair for integrating interesting things from a wide range of reading, and a sensitive ear for what the poet is actually saying. Above all it was directed by the author's feeling for the countryside, and particularly for Treago, the estate he inherited near St Weonards in Herefordshire. Anybody who wishes to know what Mynors was like should read this book.<br>
<br>He became a fellow of the British Academy in 1944 and was knighted in 1963. He was an honorary fellow of Balliol (1963) and Corpus Christi (1970) colleges, Oxford, of Pembroke College, Cambridge (1965), and of the Warburg Institute. He was an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Istituto di Studi Romani. He held honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, Sheffield, and Toronto.<br>
<br>Mynors died on 17 October 1989 as the result of a road accident outside Hereford; he was driving back to Treago after working on his catalogue of the manuscripts in Hereford Cathedral Library. As he left the cathedral he was heard to say that he had had a good day. He was buried at St Weonards.<br>
