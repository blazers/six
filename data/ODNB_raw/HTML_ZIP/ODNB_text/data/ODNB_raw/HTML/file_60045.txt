<span class="headword">Poole,  Henry George</span>  (1814&#150;1876), <span class="occ">tailor</span>, was born on 8 November 1814 at 7 Everett Street, Bloomsbury, London, where his parents, James Poole (<i>bap</i>. 1781, <i>d</i>. 1846) and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1777&#150;1862), ran a draper's shop. Following the traditional family business, they had moved to London in 1806 from Baschurch, Shropshire. When James signed up to join the volunteer infantry corps during the Napoleonic wars, he would have made his own uniform. This was apparently so impressive that he was asked to make uniforms for the remainder of the corps and his tailoring career subsequently took off. By 1822 James had an emporium in the newly created Regent Street, at number 171. In 1828 he moved both his home and business headquarters to 4 Old Burlington Street, which backed onto 32 Savile Row at the other end of the block. The success of the expanding business enabled Henry to go to school at an &#145;Academy for Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Sons&#146;.<br>
<br>Henry Poole was fifteen when he joined the family business in 1830, after the departure of his father's partner, William Cooling. He was being trained to take it over, this being formalized in James's will of 1842. His elder brother, also James, had gone into stockbroking before succumbing to illness and early death in 1843. However, in the late 1830s and early 1840s Henry's role seems to have been as a walking advertisement for the business. He dressed up and moved in &eacute;lite London bachelor circles, parading along Rotten Row, where modish society went to be seen. His friendship with the jockey James (Jem) Mason derived from this point in his life. Mason, the first winner of the Grand National, was a celebrity of the age and Poole dressing him could only be advantageous for the firm. The love of sport, and the clothing needed for them, had a profound influence on the direction of the business, especially when Henry took over on the death of his father in 1846. He renamed the firm and converted a rear stable block to make a showroom and main entrance on Savile Row itself, the first tailor to operate from the street. He gradually increased his frontage by expanding out from number 32, buying the leases and then the freeholds to adjacent buildings.<br>
<br>Poole's close association with the riding, racing, and hunting communities differentiated him from other tailors. As was remarked in 1859, &#145;Poole, of Saville [<i>sic</i>] Row, makes hunting-dress a special study, and supplies more hunting men and masters of hounds than any other tailor in London, but his customers must be prepared to pay for perfection&#146;  (Rarey, 150&#150;51). Mason was described as a &#145;smart, elegant figure, &#147;Pooled&#148; from head to foot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, 25 Oct 1866, 6, col. 1). Poole had a knack for promotion and placing his products on the right clients at the right time to ensure that they would be seen in the best light.<br>
<br>The focus on both skill and high-end pricing suited his &eacute;lite clientele. In 1846 Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, pretender to the French throne and at that time in exile, was Poole's first royal customer, giving him his first royal warrant in 1858. A steady flow continued, culminating in his appointment in 1869 as court tailor, through making livery for the royal household of Queen Victoria. In 1863 he also gained the royal warrant of the prince of Wales. Twenty-two imperial or regal crests of special appointment had been received by the time of his death.<br>
<br>Not all Poole's customers were titled. In a sample of his order books from 1861 only 31 per cent were aristocratic. His job was to help guide his clients through a complex series of coded social situations which were constantly evolving and which were manifested through dress. He appealed to both the conservative dresser through to the most fashionable, such as the prince of Wales, who in 1865 apparently commissioned a short smoking jacket for private use, the origin of the dinner jacket or tuxedo.<br>
<br>The Savile Row tailors, and Poole in particular, have been accused of being part of the great masculine sartorial renunciation, leaving men in unchanging sober suits and unconcerned about fashion. However, examination of his account books show that during his lifetime, although plain suits were provided for formal occasions, the gaudy smoking jackets and sports clothing were very different.<br>
<br>Poole married, on 10 February 1859, Emma (1817&#150;1877), daughter of Thomas Walker, draper, of Lee, Kent. She was previously the head saleswoman at Holbrook, the royal glovers, and had then become the senior lady at Poole's. Some ladies ordered riding habits from Poole's&#151;Catherine (&#145;Skittles&#146;) Walters, an infamous mistress of the age, being perhaps one of the most well-known. Emma Walker was forty-two years old at the time of her marriage and the relationship did not produce any children. They lived at Dorset Cottage, Crabtree Lane, Fulham, a property Henry had bought in 1851. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it enabled Poole to host fashionable parties, in particular following the university boat race with his own steamer boat, the prince of Wales in attendance.<br>
<br>The Poole business was outwardly successful, and appealed to premier clients&#151;the shop becoming an attraction in itself with elaborate displays for special occasions. It was traditional for shopkeepers to have good credit relationships with clients and not to expect them to finalize bills. Nevertheless, Poole allowed debts to stand on the books for many years at the same time as servicing a mortgage. By 1870 his health was causing concern and he and Emma moved to 118 Marine Parade, Brighton. He died there on 4 May 1876, after suffering an apoplectic fit while driving in his carriage. He was buried in Highgate cemetery on 10 May in the family plot his father had purchased. One of his obituaries notably claimed that &#145;He was tailor &hellip; to all the crowned heads in the world of any note&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tailor and Cutter</span>, 11 May 1876). However, his failure to collect debts had plunged the firm into crisis with &pound;10,000 of unrecoverable debt at the time of his death. His houses were sold along with his collection of art. His sister, Mary Ann, apparently sold her half-share of the Regent Street property rents to keep the business afloat. His cousin, Samuel Cundey, who had worked alongside Henry Peele since 1837, took over the running of the business, which is continued today by Cundey's descendants.<br>
