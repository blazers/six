<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill,  Rowland</span>  (1744&#150;1833), <span class="occ">evangelical preacher</span>, was born at Hawkstone Park, near Wem, Shropshire, on 23 August 1744, the sixth son of the ten children of Sir Rowland Hill (1705&#150;1783), landowner, and Mary Pole (<i>d</i>. 1789). He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Eton College and converted to an evangelical faith by his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13290/', "Richard Hill")</script>. While at Eton, Rowland formed a short-lived religious society through which some of his friends were converted. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner and in 1764 formed a religious society of ten to twelve friends that included Charles de Coetlogon, Thomas Pentycross, and David Simpson. They studied the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, prayed, and read evangelical literature. They also visited the sick and those in prison, and Hill preached in Cambridge and in neighbouring villages. This group was disapproved of by the university authorities, but they were not expelled, like the six students at Oxford in 1768.<br>
<br>After graduating BA in 1769 (he proceeded MA in 1772) Hill spent four years preaching throughout England and Wales. This angered his parents, but delighted his brother Richard and sister Jane, after whom he was most influenced by George Whitefield and John Berridge. They helped shape his Calvinistic convictions and his determination to exercise an itinerant preaching ministry. His theology meant that he was out of favour with the Methodists; his activities were regarded with suspicion by the Church of England authorities; and his temper led him to quarrel even with the countess of Huntingdon. Without this disagreement Hill might have gained her patronage and become Whitefield's successor. Another possibility was that he could have become a Presbyterian and a chaplain to Lady Glenorchy. He applied for Anglican orders but was refused by six bishops because of his irregularities. However, in June 1773 he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Bath and Wells to the curacy of Kingston, near Taunton. Though he was diligent in his parish duties, he would not be confined by the parochial system and continued to itinerate. A. M. Toplady urged him to give up his irregularities. The bishop of Carlisle promised to ordain him priest (on letters dimissory of the bishop of Bath and Wells) but the archbishop of York forbade the ordination and Hill remained in deacon's orders. In his own words, he passed through life &#145;wearing only one ecclesiastical boot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Congregational Magazine</span>). Hill was a unique figure in the evangelical revival and adopted a significant independent position. He was concerned with order and freedom, valued the scriptural content of the Church of England liturgy, but would not be inhibited by episcopal censure or restricted by parochial boundaries. He claimed that he was not a dissenter&#151;&#145;The church turned me off, and not I her&#146;  (Sidney, 138). But he could also say, &#145;See what a churchman I am; I must have it all correct&#146;  (ibid., 237). He accepted the authority of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, but amended them to express his Calvinistic theology. He was deeply committed to the promotion of evangelical unity, and spoke of lowering the walls between denominations so &#145;that we may shake hands a little easier over them&#146;  (ibid., 475). For this reason he did not approve of any doctrinal restrictions being placed upon the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society.<br>
<br>On 23 May 1773 Hill married Mary Tudway (1747&#150;1830), with whom he settled at Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire. Though they had no family of their own, he deeply loved children. He preached to them, and wrote hymns, prayers, and books for them. At Wotton he built an almshouse and a modest house for himself where he tended the garden. In the adjoining chapel (rebuilt in 1851 and closed in 1973) he used the Anglican liturgy and permitted evangelicals of any denomination to preach. This practice he repeated at Surrey Chapel, Blackfriars, London (opened 1783), Cheltenham Chapel (opened 1809), and Mill Street Chapel, Leamington (opened 1828 and bought by Hill in 1831). His custom was to spend the summer months in Gloucestershire, when he made an &#145;episcopal visitation&#146; to Cheltenham, and the rest of the year at Surrey Chapel. During his absence he employed Anglican clergy and nonconformist ministers. When an evangelical incumbent was appointed to Wotton, or when his biographer Edwin Sidney preached, Hill closed his chapel and encouraged his congregation to worship at the parish church. During the year Hill went on extended preaching tours throughout the United Kingdom, describing himself as the &#145;Rector of Surrey chapel, Vicar of Wotton-under-Edge, and curate of all the fields, commons etc. throughout England and Wales&#146;  (Burder, 127). He was deeply loved and highly regarded by evangelicals within the established church and by dissenters.<br>
<br>Surrey Chapel was the largest of its kind in London and could accommodate 3000 people. It was the centre of Hill's ministry and the congregation included leading evangelicals and the poor. The chapel was the focus for Hill's missionary and philanthropic work. Attached to it were thirteen Sunday schools for over 3000 children (Hill was one of the earliest supporters of the movement in London). In addition there was a Dorcas Society for the relief of poor married women, an almshouse for poor women, and a school of industry for poor girls. On the River Thames, Hill was one of the promoters of a floating chapel. He supported the London Missionary Society and raised large sums of money on his preaching tours [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "Founders of the London Missionary Society")</script>]. He was also involved in the formation of the Religious Tract Society, supported the British and Foreign Bible Society, and was a trustee of the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>. While living in Gloucestershire he met Dr Edward Jenner, and Hill became a keen advocate of vaccination. He wrote a tract on the subject, in 1806 opened a clinic attached to Surrey Chapel, and personally vaccinated thousands of children.<br>
<br>Surrey Chapel was known for its music and Hill's powerful preaching. His presence in the pulpit was arresting, his style a combination of humour, pathos, and vivid illustration. He was pre-eminent among the London preachers. Well into his eighties he still preached six or seven times a week. Though his extemporary preaching was described by Isaac Milner as &#145;slap-dash preaching&#146;  (Sidney, 141), Richard Sheridan said that &#145;his ideas come red-hot from the heart&#146;  (ibid., 140). Like Whitefield, Hill could attract immense crowds&#151;on one of his Scottish tours he preached to between 15,000 and 20,000 people. He wrote, or contributed to, a number of publications on subjects which included the debate between Calvinism and Arminianism. Hill's most popular work of fiction was his <span class="italic">Village Dialogues</span> (30 editions). He compiled a number of hymnbooks and he composed a few hymns, some of which were revised by William Cowper.<br>
<br>Hill was a larger-than-life character, and an aristocratic eccentric with a ready wit. He remained active almost to the end of his life. He died in Surrey Chapel House on 11 April 1833 and was buried on 19 April beneath the pulpit of Surrey Chapel. His remains were reinterred in 1881.<br>
