<span class="headword">Baillie,  William, of Dunain</span>  (1739&#150;1782), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born in October 1739, probably at Dunain, Inverness-shire, the eldest son of Alexander Baillie of Dunain (<i>d</i>. 1771) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1776), third daughter of Sir Archibald Campbell of Clunes. He had two brothers and two sisters. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, and at the University of Edinburgh, but does not appear to have graduated at either place. He was commissioned lieutenant in Lieutenant-Colonel Staats Long Morris's highland battalion of foot, the 89th regiment, or Gordon highlanders, on 18 October 1759, which was subsequently ordered to India, arriving at Pondicherry in August 1761, where the regiment assisted in the relief of the siege. He was promoted brevet-captain on 5 September 1763. His regiment was ordered home at the end of 1763 but Baillie was one of several officers and men who chose to join the army of the East India Company, being commissioned as captain on 2 April 1764, commanding the fifth battalion (from May 1770 renumbered the fourth regiment) of native infantry. He was subsequently promoted major (12 April 1772) and lieutenant-colonel (29 December 1775). Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Wilks, in <span class="italic">Historical Sketches of the South of India</span>, identified him with the Captain Baillie who did good service as commander of one of the three &#145;English&#146; battalions in the pay of the company, employed under Colonel Joseph Smith, in the operations against Haidar Ali (<i>d</i>. 1782), the ruler of Mysore, in 1767&#150;8. He inherited Dunain in 1771 but, although he sent money to his family before and after his father's death, he never returned to Scotland. He commanded at Pondicherry during the demolition of the French fortifications there in 1779.<br>
<br>The government of the Madras presidency was notoriously corrupt and incompetent. Though knowing Haidar Ali's hostility, and warned that he intended war, it failed to prepare militarily, its forces being dispersed in different parts of the country. Haidar knew from his spies that the Madras government was unprepared for war. He, by contrast, much improved his army, with many of his infantry trained on European lines and commanded by European mercenaries; he also employed a force of French mercenaries under Lally <i>fils</i>. In July 1780 Haidar, with an army of about 100,000 fighting men, burst into the Carnatic through the Changama Pass. Baillie then commanded a detached brigade&#151;two companies of European infantry, two artillery batteries, and five sepoy battalions&#151;totalling about 2800 men, his first independent command in war, in the Guntor Circars. Baillie was ordered to unite his force with the army assembling near Madras under Lord Macleod, who was immediately afterwards succeeded by Sir Hector Munro (1726&#150;1805), who was honest, but uninspiring and irresolute. Moving slowly with the huge camp-following then customary, hindered by heavy rain, and, some writers have alleged, with many needless delays, Baillie's force (with Baillie carried in a palanquin) marched southward, nearer to Madras. On 25 August he reached the Cortelar River and foolishly camped before crossing it. The river then rose, and was not crossed until 3 September. Hearing that Haidar was besieging Arcot, Munro set out for Conjeeveram (about 40 miles west of Madras on the road to Arcot) and ordered Baillie to meet him there. When Munro left Madras on 26 August, Baillie was only 25 miles away, and several officers suggested to Munro that it would be safest for him to join Baillie at Madras. However, Munro refused. Haidar, who knew the British movements, raised the siege of Arcot and led his army towards Munro's force; at the same time he detached his son Tipu with some 11,000 men to attack Baillie's contingent. On 6 September Baillie repulsed Tipu's attack near the village of Perambakam. From there he sent a message to Munro, who was camped at Conjeeveram, 14 miles away, that his losses prevented his further movement. Munro apparently feared leaving his supplies exposed at Conjeeveram, and, instead of bringing the help Baillie expected, merely sent a small reinforcement of highlanders and sepoys under Colonel Fletcher. Both commanders apparently lacked judgement and energy. Baillie, moving forward from the village of Polillur towards Conjeeveram, on the morning of 10 September 1780 was attacked by Haidar Ali's entire army: surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned. In the battle the explosion of two ammunition tumbrils within the oblong into which Baillie had formed his troops nullified the artillery and was followed by a stampede of camp-followers through his ranks, producing irretrievable confusion. Despite the heroic efforts of their officers, the sepoys, panic-stricken, could not be rallied; but the Europeans, numbering about 500, formed a square under Baillie, who was wounded and on foot, and, on a rising bank of sand, fought with stubborn determination. They withstood the fierce charges of fresh bodies of Haidar's cavalry, supported by masses of infantry in the intervals, until all the officers were killed or wounded, and only sixteen soldiers remained unhurt. Baillie surrendered. It was the worst British defeat in south India, and part of one of the &#145;most discreditable campaigns in British military history&#146;  (Thornton, 66). The survivors, including those wounded thought worth removing, were taken prisoner. Among those seriously wounded was Baillie, whose personal courage in the battle and in the subsequent captivity was admitted alike by friends and foes. Reportedly he defiantly told Haidar the victory was due to British ill fortune, not Mysorean military prowess. Imprisoned at Seringapatam, and most of the time in heavy chains, the officers rejected Haidar's offers of high pay, horses, and women if they joined his service. They remained until 1784, when the survivors were returned to Madras. A few, like Captain David Baird, 73rd (afterwards 71st) highlanders, witnessed the long-deferred retribution when the British captured the fortress on 4 May 1799. However, Baillie was not of their number. Although ill, he was denied medical treatment, and, reportedly still in irons, died in captivity at Seringapatam, Mysore, on 13 November 1782. He was succeeded at Dunain by his younger brother John, also an officer of the East India Company, who returned to Inverness-shire in 1785.<br>
