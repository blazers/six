<span class="headword">Rowbotham,  Thomas Charles Leeson</span>  (1823&#150;1875), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, son of Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham (1782&#150;1853), professor of drawing at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, London, was born in Dublin on 21 May 1823. He was instructed in art by his father, a master of perspective, whose skill in painting landscapes and marine subjects in both oil and watercolour proved an inspiration to his son. Rowbotham's grandfather, also called Thomas, had owned the Theatre Royal in Bath and Rowbotham's father was brought up in that city before moving to Dublin about 1812. During his time there he exhibited many works, and received a premium of &pound;17 from the Royal Irish Institution in 1816. Keen for his son to become a professional artist, he gave him every encouragement. However, the younger Thomas developed a deep love for music and for some time thought of becoming a musician. Although accomplished in this vocation, in his early twenties he chose to concentrate on his artistic career.<br>
<br>Thomas Rowbotham's first serious work was done in 1844 on a sketching tour to Wales, which was followed in succeeding years by visits to Scotland, Kent, Ireland, Germany, and Normandy. Although he exhibited three &#145;drawings in wax, without oil or watercolour&#146; at the Royal Academy in 1840, it was at the New Society (later the Royal Institute) of Painters in Water Colours in Pall Mall, London, that he usually exhibited. Elected an associate in 1848 and a full member in 1851, he contributed no fewer than 464 watercolours to its exhibitions. He last exhibited there in the year of his death, showing sixteen works, of which the most important was <span class="italic">Ruin Near Cape Miseno, Bay of Naples</span>, priced at 120 guineas. On the retirement of his father, Rowbotham succeeded to the post of professor of drawing at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, an institution established for the sons of impecunious naval officers. He had had a productive relationship with his father, collaborating with him in writing <span class="italic">The Art of Landscape Painting in Watercolours</span>, published in 1850 by Winsor and Newton, and providing twenty-six detailed illustrations for his father's <span class="italic">The Art of Sketching from Nature</span>, engraved on wood by Edward Dalziel.<br>
<br>T. L. Rowbotham junior, as he was known, was a skilful artist, apt at catching the salient beauties of picturesque or Romantic scenery. John Ruskin praised his work and, although anxious lest &#145;artificialness&#146; spoil his compositions, noted that &#145;This artist does at heart care chiefly for the misty mountains and the deep lake; and is trying to make us care for them too&#146;  (Ruskin, <span class="italic">Notes</span>, 1858, 48). In his early days, judging by a watercolour of 1848, <span class="italic">Rouen, from St. Catherine's Hill</span> (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), he fell under the influence of Turner. Rowbotham was not afraid to experiment to achieve the effects he wished, and he would sometimes work with water in which a small piece of loaf sugar had been dissolved, to create highlights in richly coloured foregrounds. He developed a fascination for light and found the scenery of Mediterranean lands well suited to his palette. In later years he followed the Miles Richardsons in manner, gaining impact by a particularly free use of body colour. His love of sunny effects led him to restrict himself to Italian subjects, especially those of sea or lake, even though there is no evidence that he ever visited Italy.<br>
<br>Rowbotham illustrated a number of books, of which four, <span class="italic">English Lake Scenery</span> (1875), <span class="italic">Picturesque Scottish Scenery</span> (1875), <span class="italic">Views in North Wales</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">Views of Wicklow and Killarney</span> (1876), published by Marcus Ward &amp; Co., contained many of his chromolithographs. He also contributed to Cassell's <span class="roman">Picturesque Europe</span> series and to one of Vere Foster's drawing-books, <span class="italic">Sketches in Water Colours by Various Artists</span> (1886), published in London by Blackie &amp; Son. After his death other chromolithographs were published in a series entitled <span class="italic">T. L. Rowbotham's Sketchbook</span> (1876). On 7 October 1852 he married Ellen Amelia Jameson (<i>b</i>. 1823), daughter of Hugh Jameson. Always a man of delicate health, he died at his home, Percy Lodge, Campden Hill, Kensington, London, on 30 June 1875 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery in London. His wife and eight children survived him. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> referred to his &#145;pleasing and popular&#146; landscapes  (p. 280), but Rowbotham died penniless and his family were destitute. With help from fellow artists, including gifts of pictures, his widow sold off his remaining works at Christies on 21 April 1876 to raise funds. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, has some of his works in its collection. Two of his sons, <a href="#cosubject_39367">Charles Edmund Rowbotham [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Claude Hamilton Rowbotham (1864&#150;1949), became professional artists.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_39367"></a><span class="headword">Charles Edmund Rowbotham</span>  (1856&#150;1921), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in St Pancras, London, on 14 February 1856. His artistic talent developed early, and his father, a limited draughtsman of the human form, engaged him in his teens to paint in the figures in his landscapes. After his watercolour <span class="italic">Near Bramber, Sussex</span> was shown at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists in 1877, he undertook a number of sketching tours around the country. On 5 April 1884 he married Rachel Maria, daughter of James Cotton; with his wife he toured Switzerland, Italy, and the French riviera. It was during this period that he produced his best work, which is characterized by the compositional sureness of his father and a fondness for deep distinctive blues. His works are represented in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the National Gallery of Wales, Cardiff. Charles Rowbotham died in Croydon Hospital on 14 January 1921, having suffered a heart attack on the way to his club. His son, Leopold Charles Leeson Rowbotham (1899&#150;1977), was a talented amateur artist.<br>
