<span class="headword">Aungier,  Gerald</span>  (1635<span class="mult">x</span>40&#150;1677), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born in Ireland, probably in Dublin, the second son of Ambrose Aungier (<i>c</i>.1597&#150;1654), at various times prebendary, treasurer, and chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and Griselda or Grizel (<i>d</i>. 1666), daughter of Launcelot Bulkeley, archbishop of Dublin and primate of Ireland, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58097/', "Francis Aungier, later first earl of Longford (c.1632&#150;1700)")</script>.<br>
<br>Aungier was admitted to the East India Company (1 November 1661) as a factor for Surat, on a salary of &pound;30 per year. He arrived in India (18 September 1662) with the third earl of Marlborough, who had been sent out to claim Bombay on behalf of King Charles II. The king had been given Bombay in the marriage settlement with Catherine of Braganza (23 June 1661) and it was leased to the East India Company in 1668. The Portuguese in India refused to surrender Bombay to the English, despite constant English demands, until 1665. The events around this refusal and their continuing repercussions added to the difficulties Aungier was to face when he became president at Surat and governor of Bombay on the death at Surat of Sir George Oxenden (14 July 1669).<br>
<br>Aungier's outstanding abilities and his recognized and acknowledged personal qualities&#151;energy, initiative, tact, firmness under pressure, a deep sense of justice and impartiality, and his grasp of wider issues not only of commerce, but also of strategy&#151;quickly recommended him to his superiors. His rise through the ranks in the factory at Surat, from a factor to second in council (1668), was rapid.<br>
<br>On becoming president and governor Aungier confronted a number of grave and continuing problems. The remnants of the king's forces in Bombay had split into two hostile factions, and still resented the company's authority; the king's and the company's administrations were in constant disagreement; the Portuguese and Indian inhabitants were in constant contention with each other and with the British administrations; the Mughal governors of Surat made continual demands on the British settlement in the town; the Mughal admiral, the Sidi, harassed Bombay and the surrounding territories; the Marathas under Sivaji attacked the Mughals and the European settlements; the Malabar pirates roamed at will around Bombay; the Dutch wars resulted in fleets harrying English settlements and shipping; alliances and agreements were continually made and broken at whim. The company's trade languished.<br>
<br>In the face of all these problems, Aungier's achievements were extraordinary by any reckoning. In the three years he resided permanently at Bombay (June 1672&#150;September 1675) he established the framework for the settlement's future success. He established an impartial English legal system with courts operating in various jurisdictions; Indians, Portuguese, and Englishmen were treated alike. Although this action created some dissension among some English and Portuguese inhabitants, who lost their privileged positions, he managed to create markedly harmonious relationships between previously opposed groups. His famous convention established a firm system of land tenures for all the groups. It involved the return of some lands seized by a previous English governor in return for fixed rents, governed by the same rules as for English landholders. He set in train the building of much stronger fortifications and the creation of a more flexible marine force. He was strong in his negotiations with the Indian rulers, and formed much more peaceful relationships during his lifetime. His activities attracted a rapidly growing population to the island and its contiguous territories. He initiated a town plan, with a building programme to house the immigrants, started to drain the inundated lands, established the mint, and reformed the revenue system. He also organized a hospital, developed George Oxenden's idea for the first protestant church on the island, calmed two mutinies in the Bombay garrison, and promoted trade and attracted weavers to the island. He established procedures for autonomy among the different local communities, and ensured their formal representation to the Bombay administration.<br>
<br>Aungier achieved all this despite his comparative youth and the regular conflict which surrounded the island during this period. The quality of character and personality in his administration was clearly demonstrated by the inability of his immediate successors to continue his management of the contending forces around Bombay. His successful approach to sophisticated political negotiation on the one hand while carrying a sword in the other died with him. For several years Bombay could only watch the mayhem in its region and suffer humiliation at the hands of the Indian powers. For a while it appeared that Bombay would be lost to the British.<br>
<br>Aungier was held in high regard by most of his contemporaries, including some of those with whom he experienced early difficulties. One of these, Henry Gary, in a letter to Lord Arlington (23 January 1670) remarked on Aungier's &#145;wise and prudential counsels&#146; that &#145;all this island are happy in&#146;, and that Aungier was a &#145;worthy gentleman, who is above any character I am able to give him and will by his merits surmount the malice of his enemies&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 71, vol. xi, fol. 185). On hearing of Aungier's death (in Surat, early on Saturday morning, 30 June 1677) the council at Bombay wrote to Surat (11 July 1677) that &#145;multiplicity of words may multiply the sense of our loss, but cannot depict his greatness&#146;  (Forrest, 1.133). The Surat council informed the company's directors (31 August 1677) of Aungier's death with expressions of great sorrow, not only among his colleagues but also in &#145;all those parts of India that know him&#146;. The council remarked that &#145;his wisdom, eminent perfections and care of your affairs will better commend his worth than we can tell how to describe him&#146;  (Fawcett, <span class="italic">English Factories</span>, 1.279). He was buried in the English section of the cemetery at Surat (presumably on Monday 2 July 1677).<br>
<br>Notwithstanding local impressions, malice and enmity found ready ears among the directors in the East India House, where the costs of Aungier's activities had become a matter of concern. The directors forgot the need in India for diplomacy to be carried out in some state by the senior British officials, whether with Indian rulers or Portuguese, Dutch, or French officials, and they took issue with what they termed Aungier's weakness for vanity and grandeur, and his reported success as a private trader. Despite his extraordinary achievements, he was very shabbily treated by the directors of the East India Company. They criticized him for the unavoidable expense of making Bombay a secure and comparatively tranquil English settlement; they ignored, until 1684, his proposal to move the seat of English administration in India to Bombay; they obstructed the finalization of his estate after his death; and they sought for him none of the honours and rewards they obtained for far less worthy employees.<br>
<br>Gerald Aungier lives in history as the visionary who saw the potential, and worked assiduously&#151;against numerous difficulties&#151;to establish the foundations for the English settlement of Bombay. He achieved this with a clear commitment to equity between the various contending interests in and around Bombay in the middle of the seventeenth century. His personal views and his actions realized the fundamental principles and procedures of government and law which were developed over time to make Bombay one of the great cities of India.<br>
