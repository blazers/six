<span class="headword">Tyndall,  John Hutchyns</span>  (1934&#150;2005), <span class="occ">political activist</span>, was born at Stork Nest, Topsham Road, Exeter, on 14 July 1934, the son of George Francis Tyndall, manager of an aerated water company, and his wife, Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parker. His father was later employed at St George's House, a YMCA hostel at Southwark, in London. His grandfather, from co. Waterford, had served in the Royal Irish Constabulary. Educated at Beckenham and Penge grammar school, Tyndall spent his national service in the Royal Artillery in Germany. He then took a succession of jobs as bookkeeper or salesman. He was drawn to right-wing politics, and at the age of twenty-two joined A. K. Chesterton's League of Empire Loyalists. This was an alliance of right-wing Conservatives and British fascists. It generated publicity by stunts at Conservative Party conferences, but had no electoral ambitions of its own.<br>
<br>In 1957 Tyndall left the League of Empire Loyalists to form the National Labour Party. In 1960 this group merged with the White Defence League, to form his first but the second British National Party (the first such party had fallen into decline at the end of the Second World War). The British National Party had a paramilitary wing, Spearhead. Tyndall was its deputy commander. In 1962 he published <span class="italic">The Authoritarian State</span>, espousing empire, the repatriation of black people and Asians from Britain, and a society in which work would be compulsory and gender roles strictly enforced. In the same year he was convicted under the <span class="roman">Public Order Act</span> for his activities with Spearhead, and left the British National Party to form a new party, the British National Socialist Movement. He was photographed in Nazi-style paramilitary regalia, a picture that would be repeatedly reproduced to his discomfort later. In 1963 he formed yet another party, the Greater Britain Movement. In the same year he was engaged to Fran&ccedil;oise Dior, the niece of the fashion designer Christian. She was reported as saying that she wanted &#145;to give birth to a little Nazi&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 July 2005). The engagement was broken off, and she later married Colin Jordan, Tyndall's political colleague and rival.<br>
<br>Tyndall was influenced by different elder statesmen of the British far right. He was brought into politics by A. K. Chesterton. Later, in the early 1960s, he made use of funds from the estate of the antisemitic camel doctor Arnold Leese. In his public speeches he laboured to imitate the accent and vocabulary of Oswald Mosley. He was not averse to violence, or to infringing the law. In 1966 he was convicted of illegal possession of a firearm. In 1986 he received a six-month sentence for conspiracy to incite racial hatred. In 1999 the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> published pictures of him with the bomber David Copeland. At the time of his death he was again facing trial on charges of incitement.<br>
<br>In 1967 the National Front (NF) was formed, as a merger of the League of Empire Loyalists, the Greater Britain Movement, and the British National Party. Soon it was buoyed by the controversy surrounding the anti-immigration speeches of Enoch Powell. In 1972 Tyndall became party chairman. The NF enjoyed greater success than its predecessors, winning 16 per cent of the vote in a by-election at West Bromwich in 1973. It won over 100,000 votes in the London elections of 1977 and announced plans to field over 300 candidates at the general election of 1979. In 1977 the Anti-Nazi League was launched, a mass alliance of students, trade unionists, activists, and musicians, to oppose the NF. Its success had a powerful negative effect on the NF's fortunes. The league produced anti-NF literature and organized huge anti-racist carnivals. The NF's opportunities were restricted, and in the 1979 election every single NF candidate's deposit was lost.<br>
<br>Tyndall resigned from the NF's leadership in 1980, going on to launch a further party, the New National Front. This group in turn adopted the name British National Party (BNP) in 1982. It enjoyed limited electoral success, with the election of a single councillor, Derek Beackon, in Tower Hamlets in 1993. Following further opposition, however, the seat was lost, and the BNP entered several years of decline. In 1996, Tyndall took the decision that would effectively bring an end to his active political career: he invited Nick Griffin to join the BNP. Griffin had until that point been a leading figure in the rump of the National Front, in which role he had enjoyed only limited success. On joining the BNP, Griffin first deposed Tyndall as leader, and then took that party into its longest sustained period of growth. Seen within the BNP increasingly as a malcontent, Tyndall retained control of his own paper, <span class="italic">Spearhead</span>, but was isolated and excluded from the party in 2003. Shortly before Tyndall's death the BNP fielded 119 candidates in the general election of 2005. Their tally of 192,750 votes was then the highest achieved by the far right at any election in British history.<br>
<br>Having until then lived with his mother, on 19 November 1977 Tyndall married Valerie Dawn Olliff, a 35-year-old divorcee, a fellow right-wing activist and election candidate, and daughter of Joseph Charles Parker, engineer. They had one daughter, Marina. He died on 19 July 2005 at his home, 52 Westbourne Villas, Hove, Sussex, of heart failure. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
