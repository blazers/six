<span class="headword">Hoddesdon, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1533/4&#150;1611), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the second son of Simon Hoddesdon (<i>c</i>.1500&#150;<i>c</i>.1560), a landowner of Edgware, Middlesex, and his second wife, Joan (<i>c</i>.1505&#150;<i>c</i>.1560), the daughter of John Etheridge. The spur to his future career came in 1544, when, at the age of only ten, he &#145;came from Dantzic by land, through all the marine towns except Stade and Emden, and found no Englishman trading nor cloth to be sold but by the stillyard men&#146; (namely the Hanse; <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;8</i>, 160). His most active years were spent developing English trade in north-eastern Europe, especially Russia.<br>
<br>Hoddesdon was apprenticed to Sir George Barne, a merchant and haberdasher, and in 1552 lord mayor of London. In 1553 Chancellor's curtailed China expedition revealed the trade potential in Muscovy. Interested merchants, Barne among them, began forming a new joint-stock enterprise, the Russia Company, and Hoddesdon entered its service, initially in London. Having joined Chancellor's second voyage to Russia, Hoddesdon was at Vologda in September 1555 and Yaroslavl in November, and afterwards in Moscow and Nizhniy Novgorod, where he struck good bargains. After a five-month spell in temporary charge of company affairs in Moscow he spent two further years at Nizhniy Novgorod, and finally headed the English factory at Moscow, where he was in September 1559. The Russia trade proved very profitable for the company: Hoddesdon claimed that in Moscow he obtained &pound;13,644 for English goods which cost only &pound;6608.<br>
<br>Eight years &#145;in Russeland&#146; did not, however, make Hoddesdon's own fortune. Unsettled after the deaths of his patron Barne in 1558 and both his parents about 1560, he returned home in &#145;meane estate&#146; in 1562. After raising capital from inherited land he set about establishing a &#145;good trade&#146; of his own. In 1565 he sued his brother Nicholas (who plainly had not expected him to return from Muscovy) for further land in Edgware&#151;early evidence of a lifelong taste for litigation. Although he was nominally a haberdasher, his merchant activities in fact ranged widely. By 1568 he was married to his master's granddaughter, Alice (<i>c</i>.1535&#150;1602); she was the daughter of Alexander Carleill, the sister of Christopher Carleill, and the stepdaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28624/', "Francis Walsingham")</script>. Hoddesdon's new relatives included several important members of the Russia Company&#151;&#145;a useful background in an age of kinship and patronage&#146;  (Willan, 34).<br>
<br>Having been recalled by the company in 1567, Hoddesdon was posted to Narva to build English commerce in the Baltic; Queen Elizabeth wrote recommending him to the protection of the kings of Denmark and Sweden. Seven ships carried &pound;11,000 worth of cloth, kerseys, and salt, on which he realized a 40 per cent profit. In 1568 Hoddesdon was accused of having traded on his own account at Narva instead of looking exclusively after the company's interest. He petitioned Leicester and Cecil, and, with his reputation intact, returned to Narva, where he remained for some years as chief of the English factory. In 1570 he asked the company to send out armed ships, which in July defeated six Polish privateers off T&uuml;ter in the Gulf of Finland. Hoddesdon himself wrote announcing this victory to Ivan IV.<br>
<br>Since he was rising in stature in the Company of Merchant Adventurers, Hoddesdon began to be employed by Elizabeth as a financial agent in Germany: in July 1575 he was to receive at Heidelberg 50,000 crowns due to the queen from Cond&eacute;, and in June 1576 he was again in Germany, to raise a loan of &pound;200,000. In 1577 he went to Hamburg with &pound;20,000 for Duke John Casimir, to pay for cavalry destined for France and then the Low Countries. By 1578 he was master of the Merchant Adventurers at Hamburg, where he was free to trade for himself: in August 1579 he was licensed to bring saltpetre and gunpowder from Hamburg. He also had a venture in Frobisher's search for a north-west passage, and in 1580 he was one of the commissioners who assayed Frobisher's supposed gold ore. In the same year he invested in a voyage to Brazil. From 1580 to 1582, representing the Adventurers but also receiving some official allowance, he sent regular political intelligence from Emden and Antwerp to Walsingham and Leicester. Hoddesdon was now wealthy: he had a house in Bishopsgate, London, and in 1582 he acquired a country property, when he bought from the Barne family the manor of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. Like other new proprietors, he sought to improve his estates by enclosures. This and his stance on customary rights brought lengthy disputes with his tenants, but he had the respect of his peers, and in 1591&#150;2 he served as sheriff of Bedfordshire. The suggestion in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that he was an alderman and MP for Cambridge in 1593 rests on a mistaken identity.<br>
<br>By 1600 Hoddesdon had become master of the Company of Merchant Adventurers. He staunchly defended their privileges&#151;to the point of fearing he would &#145;bring his grey hairs untimely to the ground&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;8</i>, 164)&#151;against licences and monopolies granted to courtiers. This was his last position of note; he was knighted by James I at Whitehall on 23 July 1603, just before the coronation. In semi-retirement at Leighton Buzzard, he maintained interests in merchant affairs, and in 1605 became a charter member of the revived Spanish Company. He also occupied himself with further lawsuits (against debtors of his wife; against his late daughter's relatives by marriage; against a factor in Muscovy). He died at Leighton Buzzard on 8 February 1611; armigerous, he was buried there with full heraldic ceremony on 14 February. In the parish church is a crude tablet, perhaps a vault cover, to &#145;Sur Chritover Hodsdin&#146;, and outside are two stone cists, now empty, said to be those of Hoddesdon and his first wife, Alice.<br>
<br>Hoddesdon's sole child, Ursula, born about 1572&#150;3, married in 1588 Sir John Leigh of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. She died about 1597. Their son, Sir Thomas Leigh, married Mary, the granddaughter of Lord Chancellor Ellesmere. Hoddesdon's first wife died in 1602, and about 1604 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1638), the daughter of William Blount of Osbaston, Leicestershire, and the widow of Richard Saunders of Dinton, Buckinghamshire. She was his sole executor. In a letter of 1577, written on his departure for Hamburg, Hoddesdon commended a &#145;son&#146;, Francis, to Walsingham's care; this seemingly refers to a ward or apprentice, there being no other evidence of his having had any children besides Ursula. The suggestion in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> of another son, Christopher, a Roman Catholic, is entirely undocumented.<br>
