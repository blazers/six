<span class="headword">Ashbury,  Joseph</span>  (1638&#150;1720), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Covent Garden, London. The names of his parents are not known. After an education at Eton College he was commissioned as ensign in the Irish army of James, first duke of Ormond, either in 1657 or 1658. He assisted the royalists at the taking of Dublin Castle in December 1659, and the following year was appointed lieutenant of an infantry company granted to the city of Dublin by Charles II.<br>
<br>Ashbury first seems to have been recruited as a professional actor by the theatre impresario John Ogilby. At the beginning of his new career, however, he combined acting with soldiery: Ogilby's Dublin enterprise, the Smock Alley Theatre, at which Ashbury was employed, opened in 1662, and in 1667 Ashbury still had a military occupation, since in this year he entered the king's guard of horsemen, on whose roll he was listed, at the age of thirty, as a &#145;comedian&#146; with &#145;black hair&#146;. Smock Alley was Ireland's first professional theatre after the Restoration. In 1668 or 1669 Ogilby departed for London, leaving his nephew William Morgan behind in Dublin as deputy master of the revels in Ireland and Smock Alley's manager. When the duke of Ormond also quitted Dublin in 1669, Smock Alley was for a while closed during the viceroyalty of his successor, John, Baron Robartes, who, as a strict presbyterian, was hostile to theatre. Baron Robartes's stay in Dublin proved short-lived, and the theatre reopened in 1670 under his successor. Although on 26 December in that year, during a performance of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span>, the theatre's galleries collapsed, the building was evidently soon restored, since Ashbury is known to have played Cassius in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> there on some occasion between 1670 and 1676. He assumed the management of Smock Alley in or before 1675, when William Morgan left Dublin to join his uncle in London.<br>
<br>The Smock Alley company's first tour abroad was arranged about this time, to Oxford in 1677, and then in 1681 there was another to Edinburgh. Here, according to a tradition, possibly fanciful, first recorded in 1784, Ashbury tutored the future queen, Anne, in the role of Semandra in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">Mithridates</span>. A year later Ashbury went to London to recruit actors for Smock Alley, though not until 1684 did he and his son Charles receive recognition of a more formal kind when, along with William Morgan, they were made joint patentees in the office of master of the revels in Ireland. Ashbury also married his second wife, Ann Darling, on 7 October in this year, and she in turn became a Smock Alley actress. (The date of his marriage to his first wife, the sister of the actor John Richards, is not known. She seems to have suffered from ill health, and died some time in the 1670s, perhaps <i>c</i>.1679. She had a series of children who died soon after their births.)<br>
<br>The theatre was closed between 1688 and 1691 during the struggle for supremacy between James II and William III, but reopened with Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Othello</span> some time during Christmastide 1691. This production, in which Ashbury played Iago, was presented by the king's guard of horsemen, with whom Ashbury seems never to have lost touch. The theatre formally reopened, again with <span class="italic">Othello</span>, on 31 March 1692, the day appointed to mark the end of the war in Ireland. The rest of Ashbury's career was devoted chiefly to Smock Alley. After Morgan's death (some time before 1701) and that of his son Charles (some time before 1704), Ashbury was left sole possessor of the patent of the office of master of the revels in Ireland. He fought off at least two attempts to remove the patent from him, and continued acting and managing, &#145;notwithstanding his great Age, erect&#146;, at least into his seventy-eighth year. He died in Dublin on 24 July 1720, aged eighty-two, and was buried in the cemetery of St Michan's Church, Dublin, not far from his residence in Bowling Green House, Oxmantown.<br>
