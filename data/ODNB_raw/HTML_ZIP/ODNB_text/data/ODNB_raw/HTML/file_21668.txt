<span class="headword">Peachell,  John</span>  (1628/9&#150;1690), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the son of Robert Peachell of Fillingham, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Gainsborough School and on 1 August 1645, at the age of sixteen, was admitted a sizar of Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his tutor was John Dacres. Peachell's mother was aunt of the incumbent master, Edward Rainbow, and he undoubtedly came to the college by this connection. On 2 May 1646 he was admitted a scholar on Lady Warwick's foundation; he matriculated in that year and graduated BA in 1649. On 18 March 1650 he was elected and admitted a fellow on Smith's foundation, and on 3 January 1652 was elected to a Spendluffe fellowship. In 1653 he proceeded MA, and was incorporated at Oxford in the same year. On 3 November 1656 he was elected to a perpetual (founder's) fellowship, to which he was admitted on 6 November. On 20 September 1660 his fellowship was confirmed; he then temporarily resigned to allow the restoration of those ejected under the Commonwealth, on the understanding that he would recover his place and seniority when a vacancy occurred.<br>
<br>Peachell was a popular tutor, his pupils including his successor as master, Gabriel Quadring, and the Hon. Clotworthy Skeffington, son of one of James II's most resolute opponents. Echoes of puritanism can be discerned in Peachell's letters, but he was drinking Charles II's health three months before the Restoration. Pepys (a Magdalene contemporary) records this and other meetings with Peachell, though he eventually felt ashamed to be seen with the red-nosed (&#145;though otherwise &hellip; good-natured&#146;) don  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.199). In 1661 Peachell took the degree of BD. From 1663 to 1681, by the presentation of Sir John Cutts, he was rector of Childerley, Cambridgeshire. On 18 November 1667 his cousin Rainbow, now bishop of Carlisle, made him his archdeacon and a canon of his cathedral; these dignities were resigned by March 1669. Peachell also held the Cumberland livings of Great Salkeld (1667&#150;8) and Stanwix. In 1679 he was appointed master of Magdalene by the earl of Suffolk, the hereditary visitor; his admission took place on 12 August. In the following year he took the degree of DD. In 1681 he exchanged his rectory of Childerley for that of Dry Drayton, Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>In 1686 Peachell was elected vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, and in this capacity was faced with James II's command of 7 February 1687 that an MA be conferred on a Benedictine, Alban Francis, without the customary oath. When the king's letter was formally read on 21 February, the senate decided that the vice-chancellor should not confer the degree, and Peachell wrote to the duke of Albemarle (the chancellor) in the hope that the king would withdraw his contentious demand. Peachell also wrote anxiously to the bishop of Ely, Pepys, and others. On 11 March the senate advised the vice-chancellor to resist a further royal order, and unsurprisingly on 9 April the university authorities were summoned before the ecclesiastical commission. Peachell led the delegation, which made its first appearance on 21 April. He at once asked for time to submit a written deposition, which was allowed. On 27 April he was questioned by Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, and gave a convincing display of amentia. In this there may have been some artifice, for Peachell was well connected, and not so innocent of worldly affairs as he claimed. But his bumbling performance made easy work for the lord chancellor, who showed the Cambridge men's case to be unsound in law and precedent. Peachell was adjudged responsible for the university's flagrant disobedience, and on 7 May was dismissed from his vice-chancellorship and suspended as master (though the college quietly continued his emoluments). The Francis issue was forgotten as the larger controversy over Magdalen College, Oxford, developed. On 24 October 1688 Peachell was restored to his mastership by the king's order; his term as vice-chancellor would have by then in any case expired. A month earlier Pepys had offered him a naval chaplaincy; on 27 September Peachell replied that thirty years ago he had &#145;a little itch to such a service&#146;, but no longer  (<span class="italic">Letters and the Second Diary</span>, 195).<br>
<br>Peachell died, unmarried, in 1690, supposedly after trying to keep sober for four days, and was buried in his college chapel. The college cook, Peter Betson, administered his estate. Peachell's most useful work was in soliciting funds for the new building which would form Magdalene's second court, and where Pepys's library would eventually be housed.<br>
