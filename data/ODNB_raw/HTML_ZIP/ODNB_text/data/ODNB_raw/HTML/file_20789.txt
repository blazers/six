<span class="headword">Onslow,  George</span>  (1731&#150;1792), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the elder son of the four children of Lieutenant-General Richard Onslow (<i>c</i>.1697&#150;1760), politician, and his second wife, Pooley, the daughter of Charles Walton of Little Burstead, Essex, was born on 28 April 1731 in Guildford, Surrey. He entered the army as ensign in the 1st foot guards on 27 February 1748, became captain in Guise's regiment, afterwards the 6th foot, on 12 January 1751, and was promoted major in the 57th regiment on 3 August 1757. He returned to his first regiment as captain-lieutenant on 27 March 1759 and was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the 1st foot guards on 7 November of the same year. On 29 July 1752 he married Jane, the daughter of the Revd Thomas Thorpe, of Chillingham, Northumberland. They had four sons and one daughter: Richard (<i>b</i>. 1754), Pooley (<i>b</i>. 1758), George (<i>b</i>. 1764), George Walton (1768&#150;1844), and Arthur (1773&#150;1851).<br>
<br>On the death of his father in March 1760, Onslow succeeded him as one of the members of parliament for Guildford, and he retired from the army on 10 February 1762. He represented the borough until March 1784 and became known as Colonel Onslow to distinguish him from his first cousin and fellow MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20790/', "George Onslow (1731&#150;1814)")</script>, the only son of the speaker of the Commons, Arthur Onslow (1691&#150;1768). At the outset of his parliamentary career Onslow followed his cousin's lead and was one of Rockingham's supporters. In the debate on the <span class="italic">North Briton</span> no. 45 case on 19 January 1764 he was conspicuous as &#145;the single member who said that No. 45 was not a libel&#146;, and he voted against the expulsion of Wilkes  (<span class="italic">Cavendish's Debates</span>, 1.124&#150;5). The Rockingham administration rewarded him in 1765 by granting him the office of outranger of Windsor Forest for life and an increased salary. He voted for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1766. Later he changed his views, and became an adherent of first the duke of Grafton and then Lord North. On 8 May 1770 he stoutly defended North's American policy when he opposed Burke's resolutions relating to the recent disorders in North America, and called upon him &#145;to found the censure upon established truth, not upon vague and general declamation&#146;.<br>
<br>Onslow took a leading part in initiating the <i>Printer's Case</i> when on 5 February 1771 he moved to have the appropriate regulations read on restricting the printing of debates so as to warn off the newspapers. In one newspaper report of this debate he was offensively described as &#145;little cocking George&#146;, which alluded to his penchant for cock-fighting  (<span class="italic">Middlesex Journal</span>, 7 Feb 1771). In the ensuing days he moved for the printers of these reports, John Wheble and Roger Thompson, to be summoned before the Commons for &#145;misrepresenting the speeches and reflecting on several members of the House&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 224, fols. 181&#150;7). On 12 March he called for six more printers to be summoned before the house for continuing to print debates. This sparked off the Commons' confrontation with the City of London, which cost North's ministry much prestige. Onslow made himself so unpopular that he was hanged in effigy on Tower Hill, on the same gibbet with the speaker.<br>
<br>Onslow proved to be uncompromising in his support for the war in the American colonies. Even after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga he protested strongly against peace, insisting in December 1777 that &#145;it was better to lose America by arms than by treaty&#146;, and asserting that the rebellion had been &#145;fomented, nourished, and supported by the inflammatory speeches and other means used by the incendiaries in that house&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 19.546&#150;7). He also opposed the petitions for economical reform which were debated in the house in February 1780 and spoke against the <span class="roman">Contractors' Bill</span> in March 1781. Above all else, Onslow was an unwavering supporter of North, and he opposed Sir John Rous's motion of want of confidence in North's ministry in March 1782. Having followed North into opposition, he defended him from a personal attack made by Thomas Pitt in February 1783. He continued to support North in the coalition government with Fox, but retired from the Commons at the general election in March 1784.<br>
<br>Onslow, who was &#145;a short, round man&#146;, was aptly described by Walpole as<blockquote>one of those burlesque orators who are favoured in all public assemblies, and to whom one or two happy sallies of impudence secure a constant attention, though their voice and manner are often their only patents, and who, being laughed at for absurdity as frequently as for humour, obtain a license for what they please. (Walpole, 2.286)</blockquote>He died on 12 November 1792, at Dunsborough House, Ripley, Surrey, from the effects of a carriage accident. He was survived by three of his children: George Walton and Arthur, who both became clergymen, and his daughter, Pooley, who married, first, on 23 January 1788, Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Samuel Drake (<i>d</i>. 1789) and secondly, on 13 June 1801, Arthur Onslow (1759&#150;1833), who became MP for Guildford in 1812.<br>
