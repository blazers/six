</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pryde,  James Ferrier</span>  (1866&#150;1941), <span class="occ">artist and designer</span>, was born at 23 London Street, Edinburgh, on 30 March 1866, the only son of six children of David Pryde (1834&#150;1907), headmaster of Edinburgh Ladies' College (1870&#150;91), and his wife, Barbara (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1833/4), daughter of William Lauder and niece of the painters Robert Scott and James Eckford Lauder.<br>
<br>In 1872 the family moved to a Georgian townhouse at 10 Fettes Row in Edinburgh's New Town. Pryde was educated at George Watson's Boys' College and he developed a lifelong interest in the theatre through his parents, who were close friends of the actors Sir Henry Irving and John Lawrence Toole. He was a student of the Royal Scottish Academy life school from 1885 to 1888, and first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1884. Pryde's early work consisted mostly of portraits, and he received encouragement from the Glasgow school painters James Guthrie and Edward Arthur Walton. He then studied in Paris for three months at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian, under W.-A. Bouguereau. He returned to Edinburgh in 1889, but moved to London in 1890.<br>
<br>Pryde's memories of Edinburgh profoundly influenced his art: the family house with its tall windows, high ceilings, and stone staircase; the slum tenements of the Old Town, with their narrow closes and archways, and washing draped from windows; and the ornate four-poster bed at Holyrood Palace, said to have belonged to Mary, queen of Scots. Pryde was first noticed in London as a pastellist when he exhibited <span class="italic">Little Girl in Black (Miss Mutton)</span> (1890; priv. coll.) at the Grosvenor Gallery. The sitter was the daughter of his landlady at Bushey, Hertfordshire, where he shared lodgings with his sister Mabel. She was studying at Hubert von Herkomer's school, and another student was William Nicholson (1872&#150;1949). In 1893 Nicholson married Mabel Pryde, and the couple moved to an old inn, the Eight Bells, at Denham, Buckinghamshire. During these years James Pryde became a close friend of Nicholson, and he moved in with them.<br>
<br>British poster design underwent significant changes in the 1890s. The old-fashioned bills with dense wording gave way to posters with a greater pictorial input, showing the influence of Toulouse-Lautrec and Japanese prints. In 1894 Pryde and Nicholson prepared several designs for an exhibition at the Westminster aquarium. Using paper cut-outs on rolls of brown paper their designs relied on striking, uncluttered silhouettes. They employed flat colours, strong outlines, and the spare use of lettering to create apparently easy yet memorable designs. They named themselves the Beggarstaff Brothers, and their posters include <span class="italic">Kassama Corn Flour</span> (1894; Kunstgewerbemuseum, Cologne) and <span class="italic">Rowntree's Elect Cocoa</span> (1896; V&amp;A). Other designs were never put into production&#151;for example, <span class="italic">Becket</span> (1894; Ellen Terry Memorial Museum, Tenterden) and <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1895; V&amp;A), both designed for Henry Irving. The partnership lasted until 1899. Although it was never a financial success it had a profound influence on graphic art world-wide for many decades.<br>
<br>After the breakup of the Beggarstaff partnership Pryde supplemented his earnings with occasional stage appearances. His acting abilities were limited, and his roles were mostly confined to walk-on parts. In 1899 he married Marian Symons (<i>c</i>.1877&#150;1945), a talented singer and pianist. In 1903 they had a daughter, Betty, who was a talented dancer but died of consumption in 1932. Marriage provided an early stimulus to Pryde's work as a painter but was short-lived, and Pryde and his wife separated in 1914.<br>
<br>In the early 1900s Pryde continued to produce graphic work, but he also painted studies of grotesque characters. Culminating in <span class="italic">The Celebrated Criminals</span> (<i>c</i>.1902; BM) and <span class="italic">Sir Henry Irving as Dubosc in The Lyons Mail</span> (1906; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh), these have a larger-than-life, theatrical quality and are painted with a vigour reminiscent of Henri Daumier. About this time Pryde began painting imaginative landscapes and architectural subjects. Often melancholic, they show a knowledge of the work of Vel&aacute;zquez as well as memories of the architecture of Edinburgh, for example <span class="italic">The Slum</span> (1910; Mus&eacute;e National d'Art Moderne, Paris). The purchase of his <span class="italic">Guildhall with Figures</span> (1905) by J. S. Sargent was a landmark in Pryde's career, and henceforth he exhibited regularly at the International Society, of which he eventually became vice-president, and at the Goupil Gallery. The first painting of his series called <span class="roman">The human comedy</span>, <span class="italic">The Doctor</span> (<i>c</i>.1909; Tate collection), introduces the motif of the four-poster bed. This grows in stature, culminating in the painting <span class="italic">The Death of the Great Bed</span>, which remained unfinished at Pryde's death (<i>c</i>.1929&#150;41; Royal Pavilion Art Gallery and Museums, Brighton). Here the bed has become a stage set, back-lit, before which the human drama of life takes place. In 1911 Pryde visited Venice and shortly afterwards began <span class="italic">La casa rosa</span> (1911&#150;12; priv. coll.), another dramatic architectural subject relying on the contrasts between strong, flat colours and deep, dark shadows. Again, the building is not specific but is a memory of both Venice and Edinburgh. From 1912 onwards Pryde found a generous patron in Viscountess Cowdray, for whose library at Dunecht House, Aberdeenshire, he was commissioned to paint a large series of decorative canvases. This provided useful income, for Pryde's spendthrift habits resulted in serious cash-flow problems.<br>
<br>One important commission towards the end of Pryde's career was to design the sets for a production of <span class="italic">Othello</span> at the Savoy Theatre in 1930. Despite his lifelong love of the theatre and the influence of the stage on his paintings, this was his only foray into theatre design. The set was based around a flight of steps behind which ran a massively scaled colonnade. Other scenes used painted sets and a huge four-poster bed as a prop. The scenery proved unwieldy, and his desire for dramatic lighting resulted in the cast being plunged into darkness. At the time his designs were not well received, although their visual effects look forward to such artists as Giorgio de Chirico and Graham Sutherland. Pryde received recognition towards the end of his life. He had a one-man show at the Leicester Galleries in 1933, and in 1937 he received a civil-list pension in recognition of his services to art. In 1939 his health declined and he was admitted to St Mary Abbots Hospital, Kensington. He died there on 24 February 1941, and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
<br>James Pryde was tall and handsome. He was a witty and engaging companion but could also be lazy, extravagant, and unproductive for long periods. He often taxed the patience of his friends. Pryde's output was small but he influenced his contemporaries such as William Nicholson and William Orpen. Although his paintings are well represented in public collections, there have been few exhibitions. The Arts Council of Great Britain organized a memorial exhibition in 1949. Thereafter his work has had little re-evaluation, apart from his role as one of the Beggarstaff Brothers, until an exhibition mounted by the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 1992.<br>
