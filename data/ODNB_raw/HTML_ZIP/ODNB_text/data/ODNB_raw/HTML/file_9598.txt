<span class="headword">Fitzharris,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the second son of Sir Edward Fitzharris, baronet (<i>d</i>. in or before 1700), of Kilfinane, Ireland, and Ellen Fitzgerald. He was baptized a Roman Catholic and educated in France from 1662 to 1665 before returning to Ireland. In 1668 he left to seek service in the emperor's forces in his war with Hungary. Arriving at Prague he found that peace had been declared and therefore sought alternative military service. He received a commission in the regiment being raised by Sir George Hamilton for service in Louis XIV's army. Although Fitzharris took his company to France he was discharged soon afterwards. He then lived in poverty for nearly a year in Paris. During this time he met the future informer Edmund Everard and later claimed that he had also uncovered a popish plot to depose Charles II. At an unknown date he married Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1689), daughter of William Finch, a naval commander. She, according to some, was a woman whose husband had to &#145;move and do as she inclined him&#146;  (North, 276).<br>
<br>Fitzharris returned to England in October 1672 where he obtained a commission in Albemarle's regiment alongside other Catholic officers, until the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1673 disabled him from service. He was later to allege that further rumours of the Popish Plot had reached him as he mixed with some highborn Catholics and that in 1679 the envoy of the duke of Modena had offered him &pound;10,000 if he would kill Charles II. He refused, but was to maintain that the duke of York was privy to these designs. While in Paris in 1680 Fitzharris claimed to have met a priest who gave him further details of the Popish Plot, and Father Kelly, one of the alleged murderers of Sir Edmund Godfrey, who told him that Miles Prance's version of Godfrey's death was true and that the murder had been planned at Windsor. But despite his later denials it seems that his actual contact at this time was his relative Mrs Wall, the maid of the duchess of Portsmouth. This had enabled him to act as a go-between, with money provided by the king, in an attempt to bribe the whig lord, Howard of Escrick, to switch sides.<br>
<br>In February 1681 Fitzharris wrote a libellous pamphlet, <span class="italic">The True Englishman Speaking Plain English in a Letter from a Friend to a Friend</span>, advocating the deposition of Charles II and the exclusion of the duke of York. It seems that he had hoped to plant this pamphlet in the home of a prominent whig and then make a &#145;discovery&#146;. Unfortunately he had joined with Edmund Everard to forward this scheme and Everard, whose loyalties were, at least temporarily, whiggish, drew him into a trap. Fitzharris was duped into betraying the entire scheme before Sir William Waller, was promptly arrested, and was sent to Newgate on a charge of high treason. In prison he was persuaded to turn informer by Henry Cornish and Slingsby Bethel, the whig sheriffs of London and Middlesex. He presently claimed that he had known of the Popish Plot since at least 1672, and that he knew the real circumstances of Godfrey's death and tried to implicate the earl of Danby in the crime. The whig opposition was naturally keen to put these tales to political use, but in an attempt to forestall this Charles II sent Fitzharris to the Tower. In order to get the luckless Fitzharris back into its own hands the House of Commons impeached him, and Fitzharris then became the object of a constitutional wrangle between the Commons and Lords, as well as the king.<br>
<br>With the use of plot witnesses substantially undermined by the many other Irish informers whom Shaftesbury, among others, had imported to give their dubious evidence, the fate of Fitzharris began to take on great significance. Failure to protect him would undoubtedly have led others to claim that they had also been suborned and so the whigs and tories fought out a series of delaying actions in an attempt to rescue or stifle Fitzharris and his dubious evidence. His eventual trial in Westminster Hall on 9 June 1681 was attended by many whig peers and others, but as Fitzharris himself plaintively admitted &#145;these are great persons, that I have to do with; and where great state matters are at the bottom, it is hard to make them tell anything but what is for their advantage; And so I am left in a sad condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 8.378). Fitzharris's supplications that the court had no jurisdiction over him having been found legally defective, he was tried and sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. In the remaining three weeks prior to his death he was subjected to great pressure to earn a pardon. Both he and his wife, who had publicly and valiantly stood by her husband during the trial, vainly attempted to please all parties in the hope that he would be respited. His published confession accused Cornish and Bethel of having prompted him to swear against the queen, York, and Danby, but in his private letters to his wife Fitzharris claimed that he was only mouthing falsehoods in an attempt to save his life. No pardon emerged and with not a little sense of irony he was executed at Tyburn on 1 July 1681 alongside the rather more innocent Oliver Plunket. His body was buried in London later that month. Cornish and Bethel, as well as Howard of Escrick, attacked his confession and proved it to be littered with falsehoods, while his devoted wife continued to protest his innocence. She and Fitzharris's three children lived in some poverty thereafter; Anne and two children were still alive in 1689.<br>
<br>In retrospect Fitzharris was an unlucky man who was caught up in a plot largely of his own making. While seeking to make money out of both the government and the opposition he managed to ensnare himself. Like many of the other informers of this period of the Popish Plot, his evidence was unreliable. As it was his foolishness ultimately caused himself and his family considerable suffering, like so many other victims who were caught up in the plot.<br>
