</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hogg,  Thomas Jefferson</span>  (1792&#150;1862), <span class="occ">biographer of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, was born on 24 May 1792 at Norton near Stockton-on-Tees, co. Durham, the eldest of six children of John Hogg (1761&#150;1823), a non-practising barrister and country gentleman, and his wife, Prudentia (<i>c</i>.1767&#150;1838), daughter of the Revd Watkin Jones. The classical scholar and naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13474/', "John Hogg")</script> was his brother. A reserved boy acutely conscious of his status as a gentleman, Jefferson attended Durham grammar school from the age of twelve until 1810 before matriculating at Oxford in February 1810. In October he met another first-year student, Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose friendship transformed his life.<br>
<br>Although Hogg's articles of 1832 on Shelley at Oxford, reprinted in <span class="italic">The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span> (2 vols., 1858), depict him as Shelley's mentor, Hogg at eighteen was as flighty and unconventional as his friend. As the unaltered versions of Shelley's letters prove, Hogg joined Shelley in writing provocative letters to clergymen, declared his &#145;love&#146; for Shelley's sister Elizabeth even before his sole glimpse of her (through a church window on a clandestine visit to Field Place), and wrote an anti-religious novel, &#145;Leonora&#146;, which Shelley encouraged him to publish. In March 1811 he was expelled along with Shelley for refusing to reveal who wrote <span class="italic">The Necessity of Atheism</span>. Though Shelley wrote the final version and arranged the printing and distribution, Hogg had garnered philosophical arguments for the essay and probably wrote an early draft. Consequently, his decision to share Shelley's expulsion was partly a matter of loyalty and partly of pride&#151;he could not allow his friend to accept full credit (or blame) for their joint production.<br>
<br>Sent to York to serve a legal apprenticeship, the nineteen-year-old Hogg not only corresponded with Shelley but followed him to Edinburgh, returning to York along with Shelley and his sixteen-year-old bride, Harriet Westbrook. When Shelley, barely nineteen himself, left Harriet under Hogg's &#145;protection&#146; while he journeyed to Field Place to beg money from his father, Hogg declared his &#145;love&#146; for Harriet, who did not reciprocate his feelings. After Shelley's return, Hogg confessed his indiscretion. Soon afterwards the young couple left York for Keswick. After a frenzied correspondence in which Hogg threatened suicide and Shelley grappled with the loss of &#145;the brother of his soul&#146;, Shelley stopped trying to counter his friend's sophistry and ended the correspondence.<br>
<br>Despite having lost Shelley, apparently forever, Hogg retained his unorthodox views, making anti-religious jokes and later becoming a vegetarian. His novel <span class="italic">The Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff</span> (1813) reveals his view of love (in contrast to Shelley's) as being primarily a matter of sexual attraction. Even his political views, contrary to his self-depiction in the <span class="italic">Life</span>, remained liberal until about 1836, as his voluminous correspondence makes clear.<br>
<br>Hogg was admitted to the Middle Temple in November 1812. When Shelley arrived unannounced at his door a month later, their friendship was resumed but on a less intimate level than at Oxford or York. Shelley introduced Hogg to his London circle, which included the eccentric vegetarian J. F. Newton, Newton's sister-in-law Harriet Boinville, and somewhat later, Thomas Love Peacock and Leigh Hunt. Shelley's elopement with Mary Godwin in July 1814 temporarily strained the friendship, but the satirical hook-nosed Hogg could not resist Shelley's charm&#151;or, it appears, the women associated with him. By January 1815 Hogg was writing love letters to Mary, giving her presents, and requesting a lock of her hair, all with Shelley's full knowledge and approval.<br>
<br>In 1816 Hogg took a brief European tour before resuming his legal studies in the north. Called to the bar in October 1817, he began the monotonous circuit of Northumberland and Durham, from which he found relief by hunting partridges and reading Greek. The next few years were marked chiefly by loss: the suicide of Harriet Shelley in December 1816, Shelley's departure from England in 1818, and the deaths of two young brothers, Robert in 1817 and William in 1821. Though Hogg's few letters to Shelley hide his feelings under a dry satirical wit, his affection for the poet was still strong; the news of Shelley's death in July 1822 resulted in &#145;sudden mental anguish&#146; which &#145;[threw] him off his guard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shelley's Friends</span>, ed. Jones, 92).<br>
<br>Hogg soon found consolation by falling in love with Jane Williams (1798&#150;1884), to whom Shelley had addressed such famous lyrics as &#145;To Jane with a Guitar&#146; and &#145;The keen stars were twinkling&#146;. Hogg's attraction to the last of Shelley's women is hardly surprising, but her attraction to the crotchety young lawyer seems to have resulted chiefly from Hogg's willingness to provide a home for her two fatherless children and the appearance at least of respectability. Neither a divorce nor a legal marriage to Hogg was possible for Jane, who had lived with Edward Williams as his wife but was legally married to a Captain John Edward Johnson. Not only did Hogg condone her past, he grudgingly embarked on a second European tour, memorialized in <span class="italic">209 Days</span>, at her request. In any case, her decision to live as Mrs Hogg was necessitated by pregnancy: Mary Prudentia Hogg was born in November 1827 (<i>d</i>. May 1829). A second daughter, Prudentia Sarah, was born in 1838.<br>
<br>Outwardly respectable but still opinionated and satirical, the middle-aged Hogg bore little resemblance to the Oxford student expelled with Shelley. Perhaps to compensate for his unorthodox &#145;marriage&#146;&#151;his family refused to see either his &#145;mistress&#146; or their children&#151;he became increasingly conventional, even attending church on occasion as a social rather than a religious obligation. His success as a lawyer was limited, but he supplemented his income by writing articles for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and various periodicals. In 1832 he was appointed to the royal commission on municipal corporations and in 1838 he became revising barrister for Northumberland and Berwick, a post which he held for twenty years.<br>
<br>In 1857 Sir Percy and Lady Jane Shelley invited the 64-year-old Hogg to write a biography of the long dead poet using the letters and journals in their possession. With these materials and his own collection of letters from Shelley, Hogg ought to have produced a valuable book. But his intention, expressed in an unpublished letter to Lady Shelley, to allow no one to see his manuscript must have warned the Shelleys that neither the tone nor the content would meet their expectations. Disturbed by Hogg's caricature of Shelley and his &#145;indiscreet use&#146; of their materials  (Thoma, 616) and correctly suspecting from his treatment of Shelley's letters to Thomas Hookham that Hogg had altered his own correspondence with Shelley as well, Sir Percy requested the return of his documents and placed an injunction on Hogg to prevent publication of subsequent volumes. The book was in fact even more distorted than the Shelleys realized. Hogg barely mentions and never analyses Shelley's poetry and he denies the poet's strongly held political and intellectual convictions. In addition, he conceals information, including the identity of Shelley's correspondents other than himself and Godwin, and even suppresses a letter from Shelley announcing his new attachment to Mary Godwin. He invents anecdotes to support his depiction of &#145;poor Shelley&#146; as a bumbling eccentric and of himself as the rational &#145;prop&#146; on whom &#145;poor Shelley&#146; leaned. The story of the newly vegetarian Shelley, the son of a Sussex farmer, greedily devouring bacon for the first time (&#145;So this is bacon!&#146;), or the tale of Hogg removing the balls from Shelley's duelling pistols to prevent a shooting accident fully justify Lady Shelley's charge that the Shelley depicted by Hogg is a mere caricature.<br>
<br>This flawed biography, which protected Hogg's reputation at Shelley's expense, strained Hogg's friendships with Peacock and the dying Hunt. Unhappy, gout-stricken, and overweight, Hogg died at his home, 33 Clifton Road, Carlton Hill, St John's Wood, on 27 August 1862, aged seventy. He was buried on 2 September in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
