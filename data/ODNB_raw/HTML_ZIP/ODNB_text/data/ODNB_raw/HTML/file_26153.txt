<span class="headword">Spilsbury,  Jonathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1737, <em>d.</em> 1812), <span class="occ">printmaker and portrait painter</span>, was born at Worcester, where he was baptized on 6 February 1737, the eldest of three sons of Thomas Spilsbury (<i>d</i>. 1741) and his second wife, Mary Wright (<i>d</i>. 1773), a young widow. He was followed by <a href="#cosubject_26153">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> and a third son, Thomas, who became a printer. All three brothers and their mother eventually settled in London. The careers of Jonathan and John were closely connected and ever since 1785, when the publisher John Boydell mistakenly printed the name John Spilsbury on the title-page of Jonathan Spilsbury's <span class="italic">Collection of Fifty Prints &hellip; from Antique Gems</span>, the brothers' work has been confused.<br>
<br>From 1750 to 1757 Jonathan was apprenticed to his cousin George Spilsbury of Birmingham, a japanner and box painter. He then moved to London, where his aunt Sarah had married the court painter Jonathan Richardson who probably facilitated his invitation to work in Thomas Hudson's studio before practising as a painter of portraits in oils, watercolours, and chalk, and as a printmaker. Jonathan worked chiefly in mezzotint but also on occasion using etching, dry-point, and stipple techniques. He exhibited three works at the Society of Artists between 1763 and 1771, and thirteen paintings at the Royal Academy between 1776 and 1784. His large mezzotint of George, prince of Wales (later George III), first published in 1759 is, according to its title inscription, after Spilsbury's own portrait of the prince. This royal sitting, which would have considerably furthered Spilsbury's career, must have been arranged through Thomas Jefferys, geographer to the prince of Wales, to whom John Spilsbury was apprenticed.<br>
<br>In 1761 Jonathan was awarded a premium by the Society of Arts for a mezzotint after Joshua Reynolds of Esther Jacobs. These early mezzotint portraits and another of Reynolds's pupil Giuseppe Marchi, after Reynolds and published in 1761, are among his most accomplished known works. Between 1763 and John's death in 1769 he appears to have worked from John's shop in Covent Garden, and his brother frequently acted as his publisher. A copy of his strongly modelled mezzotint of the Revd Richard Baxter is priced at 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and was published by John Spilsbury in 1763.<br>
<br>Jonathan frequently visited Bristol, where he met in 1765 Rebecca (1748&#150;1812), daughter of Walter Chapman, prebendary of Bristol Cathedral. After ten years' courtship they married at St Marylebone on 13 February 1775, setting up home at 28 Great Ormond Street. Their daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26155/', "(Rebecca) Maria Ann Spilsbury (1777&#150;1820)")</script>, a surviving twin, was taught by her father and became a notable painter and musician; there was also a younger son. About 1785&#150;9 Jonathan taught drawing at Harrow School where his pupils included the sons of Mrs Sarah Tighe of co. Wicklow, who invited him to Ireland to instruct her daughters. Jonathan's family accompanied him on this mission; they returned to London in 1791 and settled in St George's Row, off Oxford Street. In later life Jonathan produced many rather lifeless mezzotints, some after his own portrait paintings and drawings. A preponderance of clerics, many of Wesleyan persuasion, may reflect his own religious inclinations. While Rebecca stayed within the Church of England, Jonathan had long been drawn to nonconformity and in 1781 he joined the Moravian church, but his ambition to become a Moravian minister was not fulfilled.<br>
<br>Between March 1781 and December 1784 Boydell published Spilsbury's prints of <span class="italic">Antique Gems</span>, with a complete octavo set with title-page issued in 1785. For this project Jonathan closely followed the formula employed nearly twenty years earlier by Thomas Worlidge for his <span class="italic">Select Collection of Drawings from Curious Antique Gems</span> (published in parts from 1765), using a dry-point Rembrandtesque technique. Jonathan's small dry-point heads in the manner of Rembrandt, dated 1776, are also strongly reminiscent of Worlidge's work, although no record has been found of any formal connection between the two artists. Jonathan was living in St George's Row, Oxford Street, at the time of his death; his last print, of Mary Fletcher, after a portrait by himself, being published in October that year. Rebecca died in February 1812, Jonathan in October that same year; they were interred in the same grave (not following Moravian practice, in separate graves) in the nonconformist Bunhill Fields, on the northern margin of the City of London.<br>

<a name="cosubject_26153"></a><span class="headword">John Spilsbury</span>  (1739&#150;1769), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, was apprenticed, probably from 1753 to 1760, to Thomas Jefferys (1719&#150;1771), engraver, cartographer, and map and print publisher of St Martin's Lane, Westminster. In 1761 he married Sarah May of Newmarket, Suffolk, and found a source of income in the increasing children's educational book trade. The commercial success of Jefferys's &#145;geographical race game&#146; suggested to John the possibility of mounting a map on thin mahogany board, cutting it along the county borders, and selling it, boxed, for children to reassemble. Spilsbury's first &#145;jigsaw&#146; puzzle appeared in 1766. The advertisements for his business, which was established at Russell Court, off Drury Lane, mentioned prints, maps, and charts, and other books and stationery, plus &#145;all sorts of dissected maps, for teaching geography&#146;. He also took advantage of the brief fashion for printed silk kerchiefs, offering one with a &#145;New and most accurate map of the roads of England and Wales; with distances by the milestones&#146;. John also became interested in the Moravian church, where he and his mother attended services, but neither became a member. He died on 3 April 1769 and was interred on 9 April in the burial-ground of St Mary-le-Strand, which lay alongside Russell Court.<br>
<br>John's widow ran the business for a short time, then married Harry Ashby, who had been apprenticed with John Spilsbury and later worked with him at Russell Court. Ashby was still advertising &#145;Dissected Maps for teaching geography &hellip; on the original Plan of the late Mr Spilsbury&#146; in 1785  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 16 Jan 1785).<br>
