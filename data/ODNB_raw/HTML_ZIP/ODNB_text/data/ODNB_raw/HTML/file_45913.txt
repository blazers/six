<span class="headword">Naples,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1773), <span class="occ">grave robber</span>, son of Joseph Naples, stationer and bookbinder, and his wife, Mary, was baptized at St Paul's, Deptford, in London, on 24 October 1773. It is known that he served for some time aboard the <i>Excellent</i> and saw action off Cape Vincent, after which he returned to England before joining a vessel which cruised the English Channel. Naples then abandoned the sea and returned to London, where he became a gravedigger at the Spa Fields burial-ground. It was here that he found his way into the body-snatching business that supplied the corpses demanded by the medical profession for the teaching of anatomy.<br>
<br>It appears that Naples was persuaded to enter the trade by a man named White. When White was apprehended while transporting a body taken from Spa Fields, Naples was arrested and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Naples managed to escape, however, from the house of correction but was recaptured after information was received from Ben Crouch, a fellow resurrectionist. Naples was saved from further punishment by the intervention of the eminent surgeon Sir Astley Cooper, one of the body-snatchers' most regular customers.<br>
<br>On his release Naples continued in his work of providing corpses for London's anatomy schools. He became a member of the city's main gang of resurrectionists, led by Ben Crouch, and is probably the author of a diary that details their activities from 28 November 1811 until 5 December 1812. The manuscript, which is held at the library of the Royal College of Surgeons, provides unique evidence of the early nineteenth-century body-snatching business. The diary records that bodies were sent to Joshua Brookes, Henry Cline, Joseph Carpue, and Algernon Frampton&#151;all proprietors of anatomy schools&#151;and to St Thomas's Hospital, as well as to Edinburgh; teeth, foetuses, and the bodies of children were also sold. The gang frequently removed corpses from the burial-grounds of St Bartholomew's, Guy's, and St Thomas's hospitals; some bodies were even taken before a funeral could take place. The diary records the risks the gang took&#151;avoiding patrols and guard dogs, digging up diseased corpses&#151;and the problems caused by a bright moon. Naples earned about 11 guineas a week for his work during the period covered in the diary.<br>
<br>Naples was described as &#145;a civil and well conducted man, slight in person, with a pleasing countenance, and of respectful manners&#146;  (Naples, 156). The passing of the <span class="roman">Anatomy Act</span> in 1832, which increased the supply of corpses available for dissection, led to the decline of the resurrection gangs. Naples found employment as a servant in the dissecting room of St Thomas's Hospital, after which nothing more is known of him.<br>
