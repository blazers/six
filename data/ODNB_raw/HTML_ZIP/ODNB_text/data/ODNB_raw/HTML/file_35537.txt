<span class="headword">Plaskett,  John Stanley</span>  (1865&#150;1941), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born at Hickson, near Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, on 17 November 1865, the eldest son of Joseph Plaskett, a farmer, and his wife, Annie Stanley. He was educated at the local village school and at the high school in Woodstock. He was about sixteen when his father died, leaving him to help bring up a family of younger children; this strengthened the tradition of hard work and self-reliance in which he had been reared. His first employment was with a Woodstock engineering firm; he was a natural mechanic, with a talent for improving any device that came into his hands. In 1885 he moved to Schenectady, New York, where he spent four years with the Edison Electric Company. In 1889 he became foreman of the workshop and mechanical assistant to James Loudon, professor of experimental physics at Toronto University, where his task was to design and build instruments. His family and friends persuaded him to enrol as a student in 1895, and he graduated in 1899 with first-class honours in mathematics and physics at the late age of thirty-three.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1892, Plaskett had married Rebecca Hope (1867&#150;1967), the daughter of Alexander Hemley, and in his later success paid frequent tribute to her staunch assistance through the hard struggles of his earlier years. They had two sons, of whom the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31553/', "Harry Hemley Plaskett")</script>, became Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford in 1932.<br>
<br>While at Toronto, Plaskett became a skilful photographer, and it was partly on this account that he was appointed in 1903 to the staff of the small, but rapidly growing, Ottawa observatory. Few observatories have been so fortunate. In the seven or eight years after his joining the staff he created the astrophysical department of the observatory, designed and installed several new instruments, including two stellar spectrographs, and initiated work on solar rotation and the measurement of stellar radial velocities. This work was carried on with a 15 inch refractor, which did not satisfy Plaskett for long. The task of persuading the Canadian government to build the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory at Victoria, British Columbia, and its 72 inch reflector, was considered by some of Plaskett's astronomical colleagues to be a political feat in its way as remarkable as the engineering achievement of constructing the telescope itself. Approval was obtained in 1913, and when the new instrument was finished in 1918 it was the largest telescope in operation. Several of its features, novel at the time of construction, have since become standard practice, and there is little doubt that the successful completion of this project was due largely to Plaskett's genius.<br>
<br>The new observatory concentrated on stellar spectroscopy, especially the determination of radial velocities, carrying on at a high standard essentially the same work which had been so ably begun in Ottawa. Leading a small but energetic staff, Plaskett made the observatory known throughout the world as a centre for his chosen line of work, and during his directorship it produced a large volume of first-class observational material. He retired in 1935, but was still sought out for advice with regard to the construction of new large telescopes elsewhere.<br>
<br>Plaskett had a strong constitution, a great capacity for hard work, indomitable determination and optimism, and very great skill in the construction and use of scientific instruments. Those who worked with him remembered also a most attractive personality, kindly, happy, young in mind even into old age, with a keen sense of humour. He knew how to enjoy life, and a close associate remarked that he never knew a man who extracted more genuine satisfaction from his later years. He had a host of friends, and for many years was a popular and familiar figure at astronomical gatherings in both America and Europe.<br>
<br>Plaskett received many honours, among them the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1930), the Bruce medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (1932), the Rumford premium of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1930), the Flavelle medal of the Royal Society of Canada (1932), and the Draper medal of the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (1935). He received honorary degrees from Pittsburgh, Toronto, British Columbia, McGill, and Queen's. He was George Darwin lecturer of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1930 and Halley lecturer at Oxford in 1935. He was elected FRS in 1923 and appointed CBE in 1935. He died at Esquimalt, near Victoria, British Columbia, on 17 October 1941.<br>
