<span class="headword">Proast,  Jonas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1642&#150;1710), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was the son of Jonas Proost (1572&#150;1668), pastor successively of the Dutch Calvinist congregations in Colchester and London. Oxford weaned Proast from puritanism: he matriculated at Queen's College in 1659, graduated BA in 1663, and MA, from Gloucester Hall, in 1666. He incorporated MA of Cambridge in 1670. Thereafter he remained in Oxford as chaplain of Queen's and, from 1677, of All Souls.<br>
<br>In 1688 occurred the signal event of his career, his expulsion from All Souls. The warden, Leopold Finch, was one of James II's tory collaborators. In April 1688 he stood for election to the Camden chair of history, but was beaten by his high-church rival Henry Dodwell, for whom Proast was a canvasser. Enraged at his chaplain's disloyalty, Finch peremptorily sacked him. Proast turned to Archbishop William Sancroft, the college's visitor. Sancroft would willingly have challenged the crown on Proast's behalf, but the revolution of 1688 intervened. Proast meanwhile stoutly defended the church against popery in two unpublished tracts, &#145;A brief defence of the society of St Mary Magdalen College&#146; and &#145;The case of reading the declaration for liberty of conscience&#146;. Proast dithered over accepting the oaths of allegiance to William and Mary. More importantly, he hated the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> and he attacked John Locke's <span class="italic">Letter Concerning Toleration</span>. It became imperative for the new latitudinarian archbishops to avoid countenancing the view that the revolution was a victory for the type of intolerant Anglicanism of Sancroft and Proast. Archbishop John Tillotson was, complained the Jacobite antiquary Thomas Hearne, &#145;very dilatory in doing [Proast] justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.97). Proast was restored in 1692, but he did not secure arrears of stipend, and the case dragged on until 1698, in the reign of Archbishop Thomas Tenison. Proast's friends found preferment for him: in 1692 as ecclesiastical law officer for Berkshire, and in 1698 as archdeacon of Berkshire, which he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Proast's only published works were three tracts against Locke: <span class="italic">The Argument of the &#145;Letter Concerning Toleration&#146; Briefly Considered</span> (1690), <span class="italic">A Third Letter Concerning Toleration</span> (1691), and (confusingly) <span class="italic">A Second Letter to the Author of the Three Letters Concerning Toleration</span> (1704). Locke's second (1690), enormous third (1692), and unfinished fourth (1704) letters are replies. In them Locke buttressed Tillotson's position and assaulted the Oxonian high-church citadel. The debate concerned the efficacy of coercion on behalf of &#145;true religion&#146;. Proast argued astutely, drawing upon St Augustine's arguments against the Donatists. He conceded that the mind cannot directly be forced to assent to a proposition, but held that penal laws can break the weight of intellectual prepossession. Thus coercion is indirectly efficacious in altering people's disposition to search for truth, and consequently the godly magistrate should use force. Locke's friends commended him for demolishing Proast's ecclesiastical regime as effectively as he had the absolutist civil polity of Sir Robert Filmer.<br>
<br>Proast died in St Mary Magdalen parish, Oxford, unmarried, on 18 April 1710, and he was buried in St Mary Magdalen Church the next day. Hearne thought him &#145;a truly honest, wise man, and a good scholar, but reserved in his conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.374). Tenison judged him &#145;full of an evil spirit&#146;&#151;understandably, since Proast had told him that &#145;justice forsook Lambeth when Archbishop Sancroft removed from thence&#146;  (Goldie, 153).<br>
