<span class="headword">Chapman, Sir  Sydney John</span>  (1871&#150;1951), <span class="occ">economist and civil servant</span>, was born on 20 April 1871 in Staithe Street, Wells, Norfolk, the second son of David Chapman, a merchant who later became a mortgage and estate agent, and his wife, Maria Wells. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32364/', "David Leonard Chapman")</script>, the chemist, was his elder brother. The family moved to Manchester where Chapman attended Manchester grammar school (<i>c</i>.1882&#150;<i>c</i>.1888), after which he stayed in the city to study for a London BA degree at Owens College. He graduated in 1891 and worked as a schoolmaster before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1895. Here he read for the moral sciences tripos, extending an early interest in philosophy and psychology to the study of political economy following encouragement from Alfred Marshall, after having given up his original intention to become a clergyman. Attending all Marshall's lectures for three years, Chapman saw him on a weekly basis for personal tuition and was given the run of Marshall's library  (Kadish, 186&#150;8).<br>
<br>After graduating with a double first in moral sciences in 1898, Chapman went back to Owens College to become Jevons research student, and, at Marshall's prompting, embarked on a study of the Lancashire cotton industry. His dissertation was awarded the Cambridge Adam Smith prize in 1900, and he subsequently published an influential monograph on the subject (1904). During his year in Manchester he also lectured in psychology at University College, Liverpool, before moving in 1899 to a lectureship at University College, Cardiff, where he established teaching in economics. He returned to Manchester in 1901 to succeed A. W. Flux as the Stanley Jevons professor of political economy at Owens College. On 17 September 1903 he married Mabel Gwendoline (1879/80&#150;1958), daughter of Thomas Henry Mordey, shipowner, of Newport, Monmouthshire; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Plans to develop commercial education in Manchester already existed, and Chapman became responsible for their implementation; in 1902 he read a paper to the Manchester Statistical Society, &#145;On education for business and public life&#146;. During the winter of 1903&#150;4 a new faculty of commerce and administration was formed, with Chapman as its dean. This coincided with the disintegration of the existing federal Victoria University (including university colleges in Liverpool and Leeds); Owens College became the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904. Chapman promoted the study of commerce and economics in Manchester's new university, and he did so with marked success. At the first faculty of commerce in Britain, founded by W. J. Ashley at the University of Birmingham, emphasis was placed on the teaching of accounting, finance, and law, for which full-time professorial appointments were made. In Manchester, on the other hand, Chapman relied on part-time local professionals for this component of the commercial curriculum, reserving his full-time appointments for promising young economists who were able to develop the honours school of economics and political science alongside teaching on the BCom course.<br>
<br>Chapman's recruitment strategy was unique at the time, but was extremely effective in developing teaching in both commerce and economics. It also provided employment for a new generation of economists, for Chapman was, by his early forties, already becoming part of an older generation. Most of these younger prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in turn established the teaching of economics in provincial universities, where they formed part of an important intermediate generation of founding professors who were to retire during the 1940s. These included H. O. Meredith, Douglas Knoop, C. F. Bickerdike, and G. W. Daniels.<br>
<br>Chapman's links with local business facilitated the study of local economic conditions by students and staff of the faculty. This followed the pattern that he had established with his own pioneering research into the organization of the Lancashire cotton industry, a feature of which was his unusual ability to obtain detailed commercial information from business people. This early initiative later bore fruit in the 1930s with the formation, under the leadership of John Jewkes, of the economic research section, the first such university-based research institution in Britain. Although commerce teaching remained a mainstay for Manchester staff up until the 1930s, Chapman's early emphasis on teaching and research in economics laid the foundations for Manchester's later international reputation in the subject, as well as reflecting the strong research ethos that the university developed in all departments during the first decade of its independent existence.<br>
<br>In addition to three volumes of <span class="italic">Work and Wages</span>, a continuation of the inquiry by Lord Brassey, published between 1904 and 1914, Chapman wrote two economics textbooks (1911, 1912), and a study of unemployment with H. M. Hallsworth (1909). In 1909, when the British Association met in Canada, Chapman was president of section F (economics and statistics), and in 1913 he was appointed chairman of a commission to investigate economic and labour problems in South Africa. The First World War formed a turning point in his career. In the spring of 1915 he was asked by the Board of Trade to direct inquiries into wartime industrial organization, seeking to identify ways in which production could be more efficiently carried out. At first Chapman did this on a part-time basis, but he quickly found that it became a full-time occupation. The ease of contact with business people that had been important to the success of his own early research was an important asset to him in this work. In 1918 he was induced to leave his post at Manchester and join the civil service full-time, and in August 1919 was made joint permanent secretary of the Board of Trade. His appointment to CBE in 1917 and CB in 1919, and promotion to KCB in 1920, reflected his expert contribution to economic administration during the war. On 1 March 1920 he became permanent secretary of the Board of Trade, and served during the following seven years Sir Robert Horne, Stanley Baldwin, Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame, and Sidney Webb.<br>
<br>Chapman's subsequent career, up until his retirement in 1939, was bound up with the national and international economic problems of the day, especially after he was appointed chief economic adviser to the government in 1927, in succession to Hubert Llewellyn Smith. His civil service work naturally lacked the public impact that it had enjoyed in Manchester. His appointment as chief economic adviser brought with it the task of representing Britain at conferences and committees of the League of Nations, as well as attending other international conferences. When the Economic Advisory Council was formed Chapman attended the first meeting of its committee on economic information in February 1932, but his replacement as economic adviser by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross in March excluded him from later meetings. The adoption of tariff protection by the British government saw Chapman appointed instead to the import duties advisory committee, where he served with Sir George May and Sir Allan Powell, devising appropriate responses to the practical and theoretical intricacies of a tariff regime.<br>
<br>War broke out shortly after Chapman's retirement and he returned to routine administrative work, as chairman of the arc lamp carbon pool and controller of matches, as well as becoming vice-chairman of the Central Price Regulation Committee. In the early 1940s he suffered a stroke, which forced him into permanent retirement. He died suddenly at his home, the Manor House, Ware, Hertfordshire, on 29 August 1951, of a massive heart attack.<br>
