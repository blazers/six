<span class="headword">Reddie,  Cecil</span>  (1858&#150;1932), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 10 October 1858 in Colehill Lodge, Fulham, London, the sixth of ten children of James Reddie, Admiralty civil servant from Kinross farming stock, and his wife, Caroline Susannah, daughter of Daniel Burton Scott of Ingham, Norfolk. He spent four years as a day boy at Godolphin School in London, but after his parents' death and the children's dispersal throughout Britain he was a day pupil at Birkenhead School in 1871&#150;2, and a boarder at Fettes College, Edinburgh, from 1872 to 1878. At Edinburgh University, in 1878&#150;82, he read in succession medicine and science, and after two years at G&ouml;ttingen University took a doctorate in chemistry in 1884. He returned to Fettes to teach science, moving thence to Clifton College, Bristol, in April 1887; after a breakdown he left Clifton in April 1888. In October 1889 he helped to open Abbotsholme, a private school in Derbyshire, and he made the school his life's work, until retirement in 1927.<br>
<br>Reddie was unhappy in the traditional boarding-school. As a pupil he was bored by the classical curriculum and by competitive games; agonizing over his homosexual nature, he craved emotional guidance. Ideas for school reform came to him as a young teacher, his mentors including his Fettes colleague Clement Charles Cotterill, the Scottish polymath Patrick Geddes, and the romantic socialist Edward Carpenter. They were Ruskinians, and Abbotsholme was inspired by Ruskin's disdain for the competitive society, and his wish to replace undue bookishness with &#145;learning by doing&#146; so as to foster co-operativeness. Other influences on Reddie were Whitman's vision of the &#145;love of comrades&#146;, or guiltless affection between men, and Thoreau's endorsement of rural life as more &#145;natural&#146; than the town. In 1888&#150;9 Reddie lived with Carpenter, and planned the &#145;new school&#146; with his circle, the Fellowship of the New Life. Abbotsholme, the first modern progressive school, began as a joint venture, but after friction Reddie soon bought the others out with borrowed money.<br>
<br>The Abbotsholme regime stressed practical work on the school estate. Although Reddie was a very directive headmaster, pupils were given unusual freedom to roam the countryside, while their responsibilities stretched as far as the stitching of cuts by &#145;boy surgeons&#146;. Progressive parents were attracted by its ingenious combination of Ruskinian &#145;helpfulness&#146; with public-school authoritarianism, its sympathetic atmosphere and sensitive sex instruction, its eclectic Christianity with chapel readings from Confucius and Emerson, its Jaeger uniform, and its cult of fresh air. Some of the sixty pupils present in 1900 came from the empire and continental Europe. Abbotsholme was a model for similar foundations in France and Germany. Yet growth was discouraged by the lack of concern for specialist teaching and external examinations. Reddie liked boys to be spirited but saw adult disagreement as a threat; he chose yes-men as assistants and they were often poor teachers. His contradictory temperament, subject to intense drives that were inadequately sublimated, led to tangled emotional storms. In 1906 numbers dropped to thirty and the school never fully recovered. Isolated in Abbotsholme, Reddie abandoned his flirtation with romantic socialism and developed his authoritarian strain, an inconsistency for an apostle of co-operativeness; he saw the German state as the model that Britain should follow to defeat commercial competition. During the First World War, an old boy recalled, &#145;only Germany was extolled, although &hellip; German bullets were tearing Old Abbotsholmians to death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifty Years of Abbotsholme</span>, 38). Numbers fell again, and when Reddie transferred Abbotsholme to a group of old boys in 1927, only two pupils were left; yet the school's achievements since then have been based on the progressive tradition he initiated. Reddie retired to 1 High Oaks Road, Welwyn Garden City, and died in St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, on 6 February 1932. He was buried in the grounds of Abbotsholme.<br>
