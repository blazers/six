<span class="headword">Hadrian</span>  (630<span class="mult">x</span>37&#150;709), <span class="occ">abbot of St Peter's and St Paul's, Canterbury</span>, was a native of north Africa. The broad outlines of his career are known from Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span> and may be supplemented by incidental references in the corpus of biblical commentaries and glosses which derive from the teaching of Hadrian (and his colleague Archbishop Theodore) at Canterbury.<h2>
<a name="AfricanandItalianorigins"></a>African and Italian origins</h2>The exact date of Hadrian's birth is unknown, but apparently fell during the years 630 to 637 (he cannot in any case have been born later than 637, since he must have been at least thirty years old when he was offered the archbishopric of Canterbury by Pope Vitalian in 667). Bede describes Hadrian as an African by birth (<i>vir natione Afir</i>) who was equally skilled in Greek and Latin. In combination these remarks imply that Hadrian originated in one of the eastern (Greek-speaking) provinces of Africa; and an observation preserved in the Canterbury biblical commentaries concerning the furnishings of houses in Libya further suggests that Hadrian originated in Libya Cyrenaica, perhaps in one of the cities of the Pentapolis. Hadrian is next recorded (by Bede) as the abbot of a <i>monasterium Ni[s]idanum</i> in Campania near Naples. The identity of this monastery has caused difficulty (not least because manuscripts of Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span> give the adjective in the form <i>Hiridanum</i>; but the orthographical confusion is easily explained by letter forms of the presumed cursive half-uncial script of the document from which Bede derived his notice), but most scholars now agree that the monastery in question was located on the islet of Nisida in the Bay of Naples, now in the suburbs of Naples and joined to the mainland by a causeway. No trace of the monastery remains; but there is sound evidence that there were numerous other monasteries in the vicinity of Naples, and that, in the sixth century, particularly through the activities of Eugippius and his followers, there was a strong tradition of biblical scholarship. It may be assumed that the young Hadrian arrived in the bilingual community of Naples as a (Greek-speaking) refugee from the Arab invasions of Cyrenaica (which took place in 644&#150;5), devoted himself there to biblical studies, and in due course became abbot of a small monastery on Nisida.<br>
<br>In the mid-seventh century much of southern Italy was under the control of Lombard rulers, with the centre of their dukedom at Benevento; Naples and its environs, however, because they could be defended from the sea by the Byzantine fleet, were independent of Lombard dominion. It was in the attempt to recover the Lombard lands that the Byzantine emperor Constans II (641&#150;68) invaded southern Italy in 662. Although the expedition was largely unsuccessful, Constans II made his base at Naples, where he spent most of 663 and from where he travelled to Rome to meet Pope Vitalian. Perhaps because Greek was his native language, Hadrian may have served as an interpreter for the emperor, and may have accompanied him on his journey to meet the pope; in any case, it is known from Bede that Hadrian was subsequently entrusted with two imperial embassies to Francia, perhaps for the purpose of raising Frankish support for the emperor's struggle against the Lombards. A few years later, in 667, the archbishop-elect of Canterbury (one Wigheard) died in Rome, and Pope Vitalian offered the archbishopric to Hadrian. Hadrian declined the offer, and suggested instead the name of one Andrew (then chaplain of a nunnery in the Naples area), who was deemed too ill to accept. On Hadrian's advice the post was subsequently offered to Theodore, then a monk in Rome, who accepted the appointment, with far-reaching consequences for the English church. The story (as related by Bede) shows that Hadrian was the trusted counsellor of the pope and the Byzantine emperor, then the two most powerful authorities in Christendom.<h2>
<a name="AbbotandteacheratCanterbury"></a>Abbot and teacher at Canterbury</h2>One condition of the election of Theodore was that Hadrian should accompany the new archbishop to England. Hadrian and Theodore set off from Rome together on 27 May 668; but when they were passing through Francia, Hadrian was detained by the mayor of the palace, Ebroin, on the suspicion that he was carrying some embassy from the Byzantine emperor to the kings of Britain. Only when the suspicions were proved groundless was Hadrian allowed to pass. He arrived in England in 670, a year later than Theodore. On his arrival he was given the monastery of St Peter and St Paul at Canterbury (it had been a papal condition that Hadrian and his followers be suitably housed in England). Little is known of Hadrian's administrative activity as abbot; but it is noteworthy that he obtained from Pope Agatho (<i>r</i>. 678&#150;81) a papal privilege for his monastery, and in other ways assisted Theodore in his administrative duties (soon after their arrival, for example, they visited every part of the archdiocese) and in giving instruction at their school in Canterbury to which, in Bede's words, they &#145;attracted a crowd of students into whose minds they daily poured the streams of wholesome learning&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.2), giving instruction in scripture as well as in metre, astronomy, and computus. A surviving letter from Aldhelm to Hadrian, preserved fragmentarily by William of Malmesbury, shows that Aldhelm was one of these Canterbury students.<br>
<br>It is unfortunate that no writings have been preserved in Hadrian's name. He is frequently cited by name in the corpus of biblical commentaries and glosses which were based on his (and Theodore's) teaching at their Canterbury school, and these citations indicate that Hadrian, like Theodore, was concerned with literal (Antiochene) exposition of the biblical text. Various surviving pre-conquest manuscripts provide evidence of liturgical books brought to England by Hadrian. Pericope lists preserved in various Northumbrian manuscripts (including the Lindisfarne gospels) pertain to feasts and saints of Naples, and were presumably derived from a (now lost) gospel book of Neapolitan liturgical use brought from Naples by Hadrian; and the feasts of many Campanian saints commemorated in the Old English martyrology and in the calendar of St Willibrord apparently derive from a Campanian sacramentary brought by Hadrian. Hadrian's influence on early Anglo-Saxon liturgy, through the medium of these two lost books, was very considerable.<br>
<br>According to Bede, Hadrian died in the forty-first year after he was sent to England by Pope Vitalian, hence in 709; he would have been between seventy-five and eighty years old at the time. He was buried in his own monastery, where his remains were translated and rehoused in the new buildings there in 1091. Later Anglo-Saxon liturgical calendars record his deposition on 9 January. An unprinted life of Hadrian, probably by the late eleventh-century hagiographer Goscelin, is preserved in two contemporary manuscripts; but the historical information contained in this life is derived wholly from Bede.<br>
