<span class="headword">Lane,  Richard</span>  (1795&#150;1880), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in London on 3 April 1795, the son of Richard Lane and his wife, Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cowen). Little is known of his parents or early life, apart from what is mentioned in an anonymous article published in the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> of 26 March 1898, where it is stated that he was taught by the mezzotint engraver Samuel William Reynolds (1775&#150;1835), who was married to his mother's sister, before studying the rudiments of his profession in London. He is listed in 1817 as a pupil at l'&Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts of Achille Lecl&egrave;re (1785&#150;1853), who drew upon the architecture of ancient Greece as one of his principal sources. According to the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> article Lane returned to London in 1818 and moved to Manchester in the same year. He is first listed in a Manchester directory in 1821. The demand for buildings which would reflect the wealth and social aspirations of Manchester's new mercantile &eacute;lite offered openings to a man of talent and ambition, and there was not much local competition: of the nine architects listed in a directory of 1825, most were probably no more than builders. The opportunities, however, attracted strong competition from outsiders, among them Charles Barry (1795&#150;1860) and Francis Goodwin (1784&#150;1835). Lane found himself competing, sometimes successfully, with both during the 1820s.<br>
<br>During the 1820s and 1830s Lane became Manchester's principal exponent of the Greek revival style, which had been popularized in the city by Thomas Harrison (1744&#150;1839) and by Francis Goodwin's town hall of 1819&#150;21 (dem.). Early successes with a Methodist chapel, Tiviot Dale, in Stockport, Cheshire (1824&#150;6; dem.), and club premises in Bolton, Lancashire (1824&#150;6), were followed by Salford market hall, Lancashire (1825&#150;7). For this Lane used an imposing pedimented portico with attached Greek Doric columns, a design he was to adapt and develop for buildings such as the Friends' meeting-house (1828&#150;31) and the nearby Gentlemen's Concert Hall (1830&#150;31; dem.), with its splendid portico of Corinthian columns overlooking Manchester's St Peter's Square. Like most men of his generation he also designed in the Gothic revival style, and St Mary's Church, Oldham, Lancashire (1827&#150;30), with its fanciful neo-Perpendicular detailing, plaster rib-vaulted ceiling, and attenuated cast-iron columns, is the best of three early churches which all conform with the standard auditory type of the period.<br>
<br>Lane must have felt that his career was securely established when, on 20 August 1827, he married Emma Fagg (<i>b</i>. 1806) of Bedfont, Middlesex, with whom he had a daughter, Emma, and a son, Samuel. In his professional life he continued to prosper, and the decade following his marriage saw him experimenting with a picturesque neo-Tudor style for educational institutions, most notably the West Riding proprietary school in Wakefield (1833&#150;4), as well as continuing to develop the Greek idiom for buildings such as the Chorlton-on-Medlock town hall, Lancashire (1830&#150;32), and Stockport Infirmary (1832&#150;4). That archaeological accuracy was an objective of his interpretation of the Greek style is demonstrated by his reliance on the measured drawings in J. Stuart and N. Revett, <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> (3 vols., 1762&#150;94) and by the Manchester corn exchange (1836; dem.), which was top-lit and had no windows to break the severity of its temple front.<br>
<br>Lane was at the peak of his career when the first Manchester Architectural Society was formed in 1837, and his pre-eminence among his colleagues made him the obvious choice for president. At this time he was involved in the most ambitious project of his career. On the outskirts of Manchester, Victoria Park, with its sinuous thoroughfares and crescents and villas set in their own grounds, is an early example of a planned residential suburban development. Lane designed the layout and the handful of villas which were erected in the first few years following the opening of the park in 1837; the latter are among the few known examples of his domestic architecture. After a promising start the company failed in 1842 and Lane quickly left the house he had designed for himself there and moved to Sale in Cheshire. It must have been a bitter blow and it came at a time when his career was at a watershed. Greek revival architecture had become unfashionable, and the Regency Gothic of his churches and schools represented a style which was being reviled by Gothicists influenced by the writings of A. W. N. Pugin and the proselytizing activities of the Cambridge Camden Society (later the Ecclesiological Society).<br>
<br>Fewer major commissions came during the 1840s, but those that did demonstrate that Lane was able to adapt. St Thomas's Church, Henbury, Cheshire (1844&#150;5), is the model of ecclesiological rectitude, so different from the early churches that it could have been designed by another man. The Manchester Royal Lunatic Asylum (1848&#150;50) in Cheadle, Cheshire, was commended for its enlightened design by J. Conolley in his pioneering book on mental illness, <span class="italic">Treatment of the Insane without Mechanical Restraint</span> (1856). St John's Church, Isle of Man (1849&#150;51), seat of the traditional Manx court, the Tynwald, was his last major work.<br>
<br>Lane retired in 1859, and eventually settled near Ascot, where he died at his home, Fir Bank, Sunninghill, on 25 May 1880; he was survived by his wife. His career spanned a period when enormous changes were taking place in English architecture, and criticism of Regency architectural styles in general, and of his buildings in particular, appeared in the architectural press during the 1840s. In the latter half of the nineteenth century his work was overshadowed as huge commercial and civic buildings all but obliterated pre-Victorian Manchester. However, of twenty-six known major commissions fifteen survive as a testament to an architect who made an important contribution to the spread of the Greek revival style in the provinces, a scholarly and versatile man who helped to shape early nineteenth-century Manchester and was the city's first truly professional architect.<br>
