<span class="headword">Tyson,  (Dorothy Estelle) Esm&eacute;  Wynne-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dorothy Estelle Esm&eacute;  Innes Ripper; <em>pseud. </em>Esm&eacute; Wynne]</span>  (1898&#150;1972), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 29 June 1898, at 26 Stansfield Road, Stockwell, London, the only child of Harry Innes Ripper (1871&#150;1956), a City of London stockbroker, and Minnie Maude (1874&#150;1940), daughter of a talented amateur actor, William Pitt. Her two maternal aunts, Molly and Mona, as well as her mother, had been on the stage, encouraging her early theatrical career. Her first professional appearance was in <span class="italic">The Blue Bird</span> at the Haymarket, which made her a child star. She adopted the stage name Esm&eacute; Wynne, which she used also as a pseudonym for her early dramas. In 1912, when both were appearing in <span class="italic">Where the Rainbow Ends</span>, she befriended No&euml;l Coward. Sharing an enthusiasm for the theatre, the teenagers performed dances in &#145;futurist&#146; pyjamas and devised sketches and stories. A series of &#145;curtain-raisers&#146; (Coward had played in Esm&eacute;'s one-act play <span class="italic">The Prince's Bride</span>, produced on 2 February 1912) appeared under the joint <i>nom de plume</i> Esnomel: <span class="italic">The Last Chapter</span> (produced in 1917), <span class="italic">To Have and to Hold</span> (unproduced), and <span class="italic">Women and Whisky</span> (produced in 1918). Esm&eacute; also wrote lyrics to set to Coward's music; her song &#145;Faith&#146; was included in his play <span class="italic">I'll Leave it to You</span> (produced in 1920).<br>
<br>But as the theatre had united the pair, so it divided them. Coward became famous. On 22 June 1918 Esm&eacute; married Linden Charles Tyson (1897&#150;1977), a former army officer who was serving in the RAF; he changed his surname to Wynne-Tyson in 1919. More crucially, at twenty-four, she experienced what she called &#145;the mystic experience of rebirth&#146; on reading Mary Baker Eddy's <span class="italic">Science and Health</span>, a book &#145;that described the <i>sort</i> of God that I <i>could</i> love&#146;  (Wynne-Tyson to Air Marshal Sir Victor Goddard, 14 July 1960, Wynne-Tyson MSS). She also became a vegetarian, and her only child, Jon, was born in 1924.<br>
<br>In 1926 Esm&eacute; published her first novel, <span class="italic">Security</span>, a period piece of nervy social disorder dealing with the &#145;lengths a woman will go to to ensure security for herself and her children when it is jeopardised by the sins of the father&#146;  (jacket copy). A friend, the novelist G. B. Stern, found it &#145;very subtle, very original&#146;  (G. B. Stern to E. Wynne-Tyson, 28 Oct 1926, Wynne-Tyson MSS); the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> wrote that &#145;very few first novels show such a mastery of style&#146;  (26 Nov 1926). Although Esm&eacute; later disparaged it as somewhat artificial, she turned it into a successful play, sold to Lee Shubert, who produced it in New York (Maxine Elliott's Theatre, 28 March 1929) and London (Savoy Theatre, 13 March 1932). Her second novel, <span class="italic">Quicksand</span> (1927), made the process in reverse, as an adaptation of her play <span class="italic">Little Lovers</span>, originally a collaboration with Coward (Aldwych Theatre, 1922). The book portrays Wynne-Tyson and Coward (its dedicatee) as Paul and Pauline Myse, talented and attractive siblings.<br>
<br>Esm&eacute; described her third novel, <span class="italic">Momus</span> (1928), as &#145;the &#147;imagined&#148; love affair between Bernard Shaw and Mrs Pat Campbell&#146;  (Wynne-Tyson to Goddard, 3 Feb 1961, Wynne-Tyson MSS). Reviewers found its &#145;brilliant effect&#146; marred by &#145;pitiless cleverness in the execution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, 6 Dec 1928). Coward pointed out its various inconsistencies but agreed that it was the &#145;best thing you've ever done&#146;  (Coward to Wynne-Tyson, October 1928, Wynne-Tyson MSS). Esm&eacute;'s early work is fraught with modern sexual mores; marriage is seldom happy; consolation is to be found in culture, or, increasingly, in religion. Such religiosity explains the &#145;cool welcome&#146; for <span class="italic">Melody</span> (1929), a novel suffering, in the words of her son, from &#145;the common problem of how to make an essentially good person interesting&#146;  (Wynne-Tyson). The largely autobiographical <span class="italic">Incense and Sweet Cane</span> (1930) completes the quintet. A daughter witnesses the break-up of her parents' marriage through alcoholism and violence; her tragic death reconciles them. Esm&eacute;'s own marriage ended in 1930, when her husband left her for another woman; they were divorced in 1947 (he was to remarry twice).<br>
<br>Despite the increasing maturity of Esm&eacute;'s fiction, she began to turn her back on it, as she had turned her back on the stage, although she wrote another play, <span class="italic">Forty Love</span> (Grafton Theatre, 4 October 1931). In the 1930s her writing concentrated on freelance journalism, in which her philosophical interests were beginning to dominate. <span class="italic">Prelude to Peace</span> (1936), positing a world-brotherhood educational movement, was well received by some educationists. In 1938 she met the novelist J. D. Beresford, with whom she henceforth shared an &#145;intense mental and working collaboration&#146;  (Wynne-Tyson, 353). Although not a Christian Scientist, Beresford was &#145;deeply interested in spiritual healing&#146;. &#145;I found in J. D. more of the image and likeness of God &hellip; than I found in any other man&#146;  (E. Wynne-Tyson to E. N. Holstius, 3 Jan 1958, Wynne-Tyson MSS). They collaborated on ten published novels, but for contractual reasons only three bore their joint names: <span class="italic">Men in the Same Boat</span> (1943), in which seven shipwrecked men are subsequently found &#145;in another &hellip; existence, [each] fulfilling his own idea of happiness&#146;  (Wynne-Tyson); <span class="italic">The Riddle of the Tower</span> (1944), foreseeing industrialization as reducing human beings to mere insect status; and <span class="italic">The Gift</span> (1947), &#145;a beautifully etched portrait of a young man who in thought and deed practises the Christian ethics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, September 1947). The last was successful enough to go into three editions.<br>
<br>The post-war period had less time for Christian philosophy; none the less, after Beresford's death in 1947 Esm&eacute; continued in his tradition with <span class="italic">The Unity of Being</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">This is Life Eternal: the Case for Immortality</span> (1951). <span class="italic">Mithras: the Fellow in the Cap</span> (1958) examined, with autodidactic zeal, the sun-worshipping cult, discerning the pagan roots of Christian rites with &#145;disturbing conclusions about Christian orthodoxy&#146;  (J. Wynne-Tyson, 354). <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Compassion: the Return of the Goddess</span> (1962) argued that religious fundamentalists opposed to Darwinism were unable to see that Christianity is a stage in religious evolution, unfortunately become patriarchal. Indeed, <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Compassion</span> is her <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>, in which the problems of the human condition are ascribed to male hegemony. A last work, <span class="italic">The Dialectics of Diotima</span>, was published by her son in 1969. Vivacious and quizzical, Esm&eacute; was 5 feet 5 inches tall, with green eyes and small features. She died at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, Sussex, on 17 January 1972.<br>
<br>Esm&eacute; Wynne-Tyson epitomizes a particular breed of woman of the post-First World War period: self-taught and liberated to a degree; drawn to art, theatre, or literature; and challenging, in the post-war climate, both the values of the previous generation and the lack of values in their own. Writing to Coward after the publication of <span class="italic">Mithras</span> in 1960, she referred to their teenage aspirations; his for theatrical success,<blockquote>mine &hellip; to &#145;know the Truth&#146;. It has taken much longer, but it has happened &hellip; Your wish &hellip; has given you much pleasure in the fulfilment. Mine has given me much inward content, but the dreadful irony of mine is that, after finding the Truth &hellip; I discover that it is the very last thing the world wants to hear about. (E. Wynne-Tyson to N. Coward, 24 Feb 1960, Wynne-Tyson MSS)</blockquote>But the world turned again, and in the latter years of the century her eclectic belief system, that of a &#145;passionate rationalist&#146;  (J. Wynne-Tyson, <span class="italic">Aryan Path</span>, April 1972), has been somewhat vindicated.<br>
