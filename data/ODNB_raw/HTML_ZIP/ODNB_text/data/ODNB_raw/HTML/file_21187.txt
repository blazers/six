<span class="headword">Palmer,  Henry Spencer</span>  (1838&#150;1893), <span class="occ">soldier and surveyor</span>, third and youngest son of Colonel John Freke Palmer of the Madras staff corps of the East India Company's army, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1838), daughter of John James of Truro and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14606/', "Sir Henry James")</script>, superintendent of the Ordnance Survey, was born at Bangalore, India, on 30 April 1838. He was educated at private schools at Bath, and by private tutors at Woolwich and Plumstead, and in January 1856 was admitted to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was gazetted lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 20 December 1857, and studied in the School of Military Engineering at Chatham (1857&#150;8), and between January and October 1858 served at Portsmouth and then on the Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>In October 1858 Palmer was appointed to the expedition to British Columbia under Colonel Richard Clement Moody RE. The expedition was originated by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, then secretary of state for the colonies, and consisted of six officers and 150 men from the Royal Engineers, who were to preserve order, which was rapidly deteriorating as gold prospectors rushed into the newly created colony, and carry out engineering works and surveys there. In British Columbia Palmer undertook a reconnaissance survey of the Cariboo gold fields in 1862, accomplished under great difficulties, and in that year it was largely due to his judgement that his party escaped massacre by the Bella Coola Indians at North Bentinck arm. The reports and maps prepared by him in connection with these surveys were published in parliamentary and colonial blue books. He also superintended the construction of roads, bridges, and other public works, including the wagon road through the canyon of the Fraser River, between Lytton and Yale. He married, on 7 October 1863, at New Westminster, British Columbia, Mary Jane Pearson, daughter of Archdeacon Henry Press Wright; they had nine children, of whom six survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>At the end of December 1863 Palmer arrived back in England and the following March joined the Ordnance Survey. He went first to Southampton and then to Tonbridge, Kent, from where he surveyed the greater part of Kent and east Sussex, and parts of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. He was promoted second captain on 4 March 1866. Under the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> he was appointed assistant commissioner in the parliamentary boundaries commission: with a colleague, Joseph Kay, he designated parliamentary boroughs in Kent and east Sussex, and subdivided county boroughs of west Kent and east Surrey.<br>
<br>At this time Palmer and a friend, the Revd Pierce Butler, of Ulcombe, Kent&#151;an Arabic scholar&#151;were planning a survey of the Sinai peninsula. Palmer persuaded his uncle, Henry James, head of the Ordnance Survey, to support the scheme and James persuaded the Royal Geographical Society and Royal Society to give financial support to a survey of the topography and a study of the geology, botany, and zoology of the region. Butler's death in 1868 did not stop the expedition, which set off in October 1868 under Palmer and C. W. Wilson. They completed their work by April 1869, despite the extremes of terrain and climate that they encountered. The two leaders edited the <span class="italic">Ordnance Survey of the Peninsula of Sinai</span> (5 vols.), officially dated 1869 though published in 1872. Palmer returned to England in May 1869 and resumed work at Tonbridge.<br>
<br>On 11 December 1873 Palmer was promoted major and in the same year he was appointed head of the expedition to observe the transit of Venus in New Zealand, for which he underwent a course of practical preparation at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. He left England in June 1874, accompanied by Lieutenant L. Darwin RE, and Lieutenant Crawford RN, as his assistants. His work in observing the transit was highly praised by the astronomer royal in his <span class="italic">Report to the Board of Visitors</span> (1875). Before leaving New Zealand, Palmer, at the request of the governor, George Phipps, second marquess of Normanby, undertook an investigation of provincial surveys throughout the colony, to advise how to make them more systematic and scientifically sound. His recommendations earned him the thanks of the government, and were adopted as a guide for future reforms. He helped the French to determine the longitude of Campbell Island, for which he received the medal of the Institut de France.<br>
<br>Palmer returned to England in June 1875 and against his inclination, which was to continue with survey and engineering work, resumed military duty, going to Barbados in November 1875, where he was appointed aide-de-camp to the governor, Sir John Pope-Hennessy; he remained in this post through the riots of 1876 and until the governor's departure from the colony. In January 1878 he went to Hong Kong, where, in addition to his ordinary duties, he was appointed engineer of the Admiralty works and aide-de-camp to the governor, again John Pope-Hennessy. On 1 July 1881 he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel. In the same year he designed an observatory for Hong Kong to facilitate astronomical, magnetical, meteorological, and tidal observations. The design and report were approved by the Kew committee of the Royal Society and though the scheme was adapted to reduce its cost, the observatory was built largely to his design, which became a standard guide for similar observatories. In 1882 Palmer declined to take charge of another expedition to observe the transit of Venus, but he made in that year an exact determination of the Hong Kong observatory station at Mount Elgin, Kowloon, with instruments lent to him from the American surveying ship <i>Palos</i>.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1882 Palmer was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel, and was ordered home. On his way he stayed at the British legation in Tokyo and was asked by the Japanese government to design waterworks for Yokohama. He completed two alternative schemes of water supply, one from Tamagawa and the other from Sagamigawa. On his arrival in England in July 1883 he was appointed commanding royal engineer of the Manchester district. In the autumn of 1884 the Japanese government applied to the British government for his services to superintend the construction of waterworks in accordance with his design. Permission was given, Palmer reached Japan in April 1885, and the works were started at once. On 1 July Palmer was promoted brevet colonel, and on 1 October 1887 he retired on a pension with the honorary rank of major-general. The same date saw the successful completion of the waterworks, for which in November he received from the emperor of Japan the third class of the order of the Rising Sun; he obtained the queen's permission to wear the order. After his retirement he remained in Japan and undertook numerous important engineering works. These included water supply works for Osaka and Hakodate, harbour works for the Yokohama Harbour Company, and water supplies for Misakamura in Hiogo Ken and for Tokyo; he supervised the building of many of his works. With Uta Saito, whom he may have married about 1890, he had a daughter. He died of apoplexy at 41 Imaicho Azabu, Tokyo, on 10 February 1893, while working on a project there. He was buried in the Aoyama cemetery in Tokyo.<br>
<br>A contemporary obituarist wrote that Palmer was a man of exceptionally clear, vigorous intellect, and remarkable breadth and liberality of view. His faculty of rapid calculation was of a high order, and he possessed a &#145;rare power of assimilating and marshalling facts&#146;  (Captain F. Brinkley, <span class="italic">Japan Weekly Mail</span>, 18 Feb 1898, cited in Higuchi, iv). He had a keen sense of humour and power of anecdote. His books <span class="italic">The Ordnance Survey of the Kingdom</span> (1873) and <span class="italic">Ancient History from the Monuments: Sinai from the Fourth Egyptian Dynasty to the Present Day</span> (1878) are memorable but he was perhaps most important as a journalist writing in English on Japan (his fifty-five newspaper articles are listed in Higuchi, 107&#150;10) and those forty-eight which were published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> did much to increase understanding of Japan among the British.<br>
<br>A bust to his memory was erected in the Nogeyama public garden, Yokohama, in 1987. A full length biographical memoir by his grandson J. Higuchi was published in 2002. He also published, in 1982, a Japanese translation of his grandfather's <span class="italic">Letters from the land of the rising sun</span> (1894). An exhibition catalogue, <span class="italic">Henry Spencer Palmer&#151;a special exhibition of his work and designs for the water works and harbour works of Yokohama</span> (Yokohama, 1987) marked the centenary of one of his most important engineering projects.<br>
