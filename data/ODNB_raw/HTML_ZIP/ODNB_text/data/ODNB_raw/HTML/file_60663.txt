<span class="headword">Fothergill,  (Arthur) Brian</span>  (1921&#150;1990), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born on 3 April 1921 at 3 Park Avenue, Lytham St Annes, the youngest of three children of John Smirthwaite Fothergill (1887&#150;1938) and his wife, Kathleen Anderson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Entwisle (1895&#150;1957), daughter of Anderson Entwisle of Milnshaw, Lytham St Annes. The Fothergills were a wealthy, landowning family with property in Westmorland and John Smirthwaite Fothergill was able to live near Kendal on family income.<br>
<br>Brian Fothergill (seldom referred to as Arthur) was educated at Wycliffe College, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, from 1931 to 1937, and at King's College, London, from 1939 to 1942. He had decided to become an Anglican priest and therefore did not sit his final degree examinations but left as an associate of King's College. He then took a pre-ordination course at Westcott House, Cambridge, from 1942 to 1944 and probably qualified for the priesthood; however, in 1944 he joined the army intelligence corps. He served in India and Malaya, where he met several people who were to become his lifelong friends, including Kenneth Williams, Stanley Baxter, and John Schlesinger. The experiences of army life apparently overturned his career plans and he never went back to the idea of becoming a priest. The army also gave him the opportunity to refine his beliefs and soon after he was demobbed in 1947 he was received into the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Fothergill began work as a schoolteacher, with his longest spell as assistant master at St Philip's School in South Kensington, London, from 1949 to 1956. Despite struggling on for nine years, teaching never gave him any satisfaction and in 1957 he decided to devote all his time to writing. It was probably his mother's death which enabled him to break away from teaching. His father had been killed in 1938 by a train and in 1941 his mother married J. M. Somervell of Kendal. The Somervells owned K Shoes and it was said that Fothergill's mother first married into one of the oldest families in Westmorland and then into one of the richest. In 1957 Fothergill would have inherited a secure income for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Fothergill had trouble settling to a regular routine. The root of his problem was his homosexuality, which led to his constantly moving home&#151;from Earls Court, to St John's Wood, to Chelsea in London; then to Brighton&#151;and it was not until about 1970 when he bought a house in Islington, London, and met Owen Gordon, a clerk with the St John Ambulance Brigade, that he was able to enjoy a long-term relationship.<br>
<br>Fothergill's first book, a biography of the brother of Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie), was almost written before he left teaching and was published in 1958 as <span class="italic">The Cardinal King</span>. It was followed by six other biographies, all published by Faber and Faber. His biographies were usually about people on the margins of history with odd characteristics; some were downright eccentrics. All his work was meticulously researched, and if his subject was already written about, Fothergill usually managed to present new evidence and to rescue the person's reputation from obloquy. The most striking example of such rehabilitation was his treatment of Sir William Hamilton, previously known for little other than his willingness to live as Nelson's cuckold; Fothergill showed Hamilton to have been an outstanding diplomat, soldier, scholar, and epitome of an eighteenth-century man of taste.<br>
<br>Fothergill received the PEN Silver Pen award for <span class="italic">Sir William Hamilton</span> and the Heinemann award for literature for <span class="italic">Sir William Hamilton</span> and <span class="italic">Beckford of Fonthill</span>. Critical acclaim was given to all his books, although they were not best-sellers, as he himself was well aware. He once told his publisher that sales of <span class="italic">The Mitred Earl</span> might have doubled had it been called <span class="italic">The Belted Bishop</span>. He was elected a fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society of Literature in 1970, and in the Royal Society of Literature he went on to become a member of the council in 1977, the vice-president in 1986, and chairman from 1986 to 1989. In 1980 he edited the society's annual <span class="italic">Essays by Divers Hands</span>.<br>
<br>Fothergill was a tall man who paid attention to his clothes and his appearance, although without regard to contemporary fashion. Towards the end of his life his health deteriorated quickly. He contracted tuberculosis and then had a heart bypass before being diagnosed with cancer. During these illnesses he was nursed by Owen Gordon and spent much of his time reconsidering his religious beliefs. Just before he died he gave up Catholicism and returned to the Church of England.<br>
<br>Brian Fothergill died on 6 August 1990 at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, London.<br>
