<span class="headword">Balfour, Sir  (Thomas) Graham</span>  (1858&#150;1929), <span class="occ">author and educationist</span>, born in Chelsea on 2 December 1858, was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1197/', "Surgeon-General Thomas Graham Balfour")</script> and his wife, Georgina, daughter of George Prentice of Armagh. On his father's side he was closely connected, through the Balfours of Pilrig, with Robert Louis Stevenson. He was educated at Marlborough College and at Worcester College, Oxford. His school life was partly impaired by ill health; at the university he obtained a first class in classical moderations (1880) and a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1882), and won distinction as a rifle shot.<br>
<br>In 1885 Balfour was called to the bar by the Inner Temple, but he found the practice of advocacy uncongenial, and his chief piece of work was his contribution (the chapter on Battersea) to Charles Booth's <span class="italic">Life and Labour of the People in London</span> (1891&#150;1903). For a time he travelled extensively, and in 1891, after the death of his parents, he accepted Stevenson's invitation to make his home at Vailima, Samoa. On Stevenson's death in 1894 Balfour returned to England. In 1896 he married Rhoda, daughter of Leonard Dobbin Brooke of Birkenhead; they had two sons. The Balfours settled at Oxford, where he wrote his two principal works. His <span class="italic">Educational Systems of Great Britain and Ireland</span> appeared in 1898 and rapidly became a standard authority; his <span class="italic">Life of Robert Louis Stevenson</span>, written at the request of Stevenson's family for the Edinburgh edition of his works, followed in 1901, and established Balfour's reputation as a biographer.<br>
<br>During Balfour's residence in Oxford he served the delegacy of local examinations, first as examiner, then as assistant secretary. In 1902 he was appointed director of technical education, and in 1903 general director of education, to the county of Staffordshire. His appointment came at a critical time following the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902 which had remodelled the educational administration of England. The organization of resources and provision now replaced religion as the central issue in elementary education, and Balfour has been accounted highly successful in dealing with the changed priorities. His task was to build up the local education service serving a population of 600,000 and to co-ordinate the existing authorities which comprised five county boroughs, nine boroughs and urban districts with powers over elementary education, and twenty-nine school boards. His administration of education in Staffordshire became an example to the country at large. In his first ten years forty-nine new council schools were built. Although the product of a classical education, with no experience of industry or commerce, he successfully promoted technical education, extending the pottery school at Stoke, and establishing the technical colleges at Wednesbury and Wolverhampton and the mining college on Cannock Chase. He was a pioneer both of school gardens and of school libraries. In his report, <span class="italic">Ten Years of Staffordshire Education, 1903&#150;1913</span> (1913), he described how the new county education committee had sought to administer rather than to control, and had tried to leave as much initiative as possible to school managers and teachers. The addresses on educational administration that he gave to the University of Birmingham in 1921 were considered to be models of their kind.<br>
<br>In 1907 Balfour received the honorary degree of MA from Cambridge University and in 1924 that of LLD from the University of Birmingham. He was knighted in 1917. He served as chairman of the association of directors and secretaries of education (1908), and as a member of the reconstruction committee on adult education (1917&#150;19), the committee on the position of science in education (1916&#150;18), and the consultative committee of the Board of Education (1926&#150;9). During the last year of the European war (1918&#150;19) he served as director of education in France (lines of communication) for the YMCA.<br>
<br>Balfour retired in 1926 and returned to Oxford, where he became a member of the city education committee, the delegacy for extramural studies, and the council of Barnett House. He died at 4 Blackhall Road, Oxford, on 26 October 1929.<br>
