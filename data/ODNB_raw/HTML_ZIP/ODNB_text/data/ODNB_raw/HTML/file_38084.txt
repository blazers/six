<span class="headword">Twort,  Frederick William</span>  (1877&#150;1950), <span class="occ">microbiologist</span>, was born on 22 October 1877 in Camberley, Surrey, the eldest of six sons and the second of the eleven children of Dr William Henry Twort, general practitioner, of Camberley, and his wife, Elizabeth Crampton, only child of Joseph Crampton Webster, engineer, of London. He was educated at Tomlinson's School, Woking, and St Thomas's Hospital, London, and qualified LRCP, MRCS, in 1900.<br>
<br>In 1901 Twort became an assistant in the clinical laboratory at St Thomas's Hospital and in December that year was appointed assistant to William Bulloch, bacteriologist at the London Hospital, Whitechapel. Here he gained valuable experience and, though occupied with much routine work, commenced innovative research. His study of bacterial fermentation of glucosides won the London University Rogers prize (jointly) in 1908. He demonstrated bacterial variability and adaptability and formulated his lifelong belief that disease-producing organisms had evolved from non-pathogenic ancestors. He also showed that the glucoside ericolin acted as a selective inhibitor of bacterial growth, thus aiding the isolation of pure cultures.<br>
<br>In 1909 Twort was appointed superintendent of the Brown Animal Sanatory Institution in London, where he remained until its destruction by bombing in 1944. Relative isolation suited his character and he followed his own ideas with considerable success. He demonstrated that supplementation of media with an &#145;essential substance&#146; extracted from dead tubercle bacilli permitted growth of Johne's bacillus and possibly the leprosy bacillus. With his veterinary colleague George Ingram he wrote <span class="italic">A Monograph on Johne's Disease of Cattle</span> (1913).<br>
<br>Twort's most important contribution to microbiology was his discovery of bacteriophage. He noticed that colonies of micrococci had become transparent and that transfer of this material to a growing colony reproduced the condition. This transmissible lysis, later known as the Twort&#150;d'H&eacute;relle phenomenon, is of central importance to molecular biology. A paper by Twort in 1915 illustrates his cautious approach to research, as he lists several possible explanations for the phenomenon, rather than risk premature judgement. Owing to war and limited facilities he left exploitation of his discoveries to others. In the First World War he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps as temporary captain in charge of the base laboratory at Salonika in 1916, and later in Northern Ireland as bacteriologist in 1918. He married Dorothy Mary, eldest daughter of Frederick J. Banister, an architect, in 1919. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1929 Twort was elected FRS and in 1931 he became professor of bacteriology at London University. Brown Institution trust funds were never adequate, but Twort preferred impecunious independence. When, after fifteen years, a Medical Research Council grant was withdrawn, he unsuccessfully lodged a petition of right against the crown in 1937.<br>
<br>Twort was a reserved and somewhat unworldly man. However, over scientific matters he could be roused to considerable passion and was often tactless. He constructed much of his own research apparatus, experimented with violin making, designed novel coils to improve wireless reception, and was a keen horticulturist. He died at his home, The Wilderness, Gordon Road, Camberley, Surrey, on 20 March 1950.<br>
