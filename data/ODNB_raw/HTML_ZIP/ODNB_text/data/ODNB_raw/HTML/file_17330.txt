<span class="headword">Ward,  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [Hugo Vardeus, Aodh Buidhe  Mac an Bhaird]</span>  (1592&#150;1635), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and historian</span>, a native of co. Donegal, was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70043/', "Mac an Bhaird family")</script>, hereditary poets to the O'Donnells of Tirconaill. His parents were Eugenius Wardeus (possibly to be identified as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72770/', "Eoghan Ruadh Mac an Bhaird")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70043/', "Mac an Bhaird family")</script>]) and Maria N&iacute; Chlery. His early education was obtained within his own family circle. He left Ireland in 1612 to study at the Irish College in Salamanca, Spain, and joined the Franciscan order there in 1616&#151;a career not untypical of his learned contemporaries for whom traditional sources of patronage had significantly diminished after 1603. On 22 March 1622 Ward was appointed to teach philosophy at the Irish Franciscan college of St Anthony in Louvain and travelled from Salamanca to Louvain, via Paris, Rouen, and Nantes, early in 1623. He never returned to Ireland.<br>
<br>Ward was in Paris in March 1623 serving as companion to Francis de Arriba, confessor of the queen of France. There he came into contact with fellow Franciscans Patrick Fleming and Hugh MacCaughwell and the secular priest Thomas Messingham. The group discussed their shared interest in researching the lives of Irish saints and agreed to collaborate on publishing their findings. The association with Messingham was not long-lived, but Fleming and Ward continued to work together until Fleming's death in 1631. Ward subsequently collaborated with John Colgan and other Louvain-based Irish Franciscans. One of the first hagiographical publications to emerge from Louvain was Robert Rochford's <span class="italic">Life of the glorious bishop St Patrick &hellip; together with the lives of the holy Virgin, St Brigid, and of the glorious Abbot St Columb, patrons of Ireland</span>, published at St Omer in 1625. It provides evidence that Ward's interest in Irish saints' lives was shared by others in his community also. In Louvain, Ward's fellow Franciscans included Thomas Fleming, Florence Conry, Robert Chamberlain, John Colgan, Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, and his own brother, Ferdinand Ward. He also received encouragement in his historical researches from Luke Wadding in Rome.<br>
<br>Ward was elected guardian of St Anthony's three years after his arrival there, the appointment being confirmed on 22 April 1626. The following day he was authorized to conduct research in German and French libraries on the lives of Irish saints, but was probably away for a relatively short time. In addition to his administrative duties at the college he also taught theology. Ward became a prominent figure in the Catholic church in the diocese of Malines (Mechelen) and his work on behalf of the Franciscan order was not confined to the world of the college of St Anthony. A proposal that he be transferred to the new Irish Franciscan college at Prague in 1630 was not implemented.<br>
<br>From his Louvain base Ward directed Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's researches in Ireland on the early history of Ireland and her saints and kings. He particularly welcomed the compilation of the martyrology of Donegal, completed in 1630. In 1631, at the request of the archbishop of Malines (Mechelen), Ward was himself researching the life of St Romuald, patron of the diocese of Malines (Mechelen), drawing on the earlier lives already in circulation. This work, <span class="italic">Sancti Rumoldi &hellip; acta</span>, completed in 1631, was published posthumously, edited by Thomas Sirinus (Sheeran) in 1662, &#145;least he should be forgotten who had begun these studies, or least it should be supposed that nothing had been achieved by all his toil&#146;  (Jennings, <span class="italic">Michael O Cleirigh</span>, 105, citing preface to <span class="italic">Sancti Rumoldi &hellip; acta</span>). Ward co-operated with the Bollandists in their hagiographical researches, contributing lives of saints Mochua, Maed&oacute;c, and Fechin to their <span class="italic">Acta sanctorum</span>, and preparing material for subsequent volumes.<br>
<br>Although Ward worked indefatigably on researching Irish saints' lives, administrative responsibilities and poor health prevented his research being published in his lifetime. John Colgan's <span class="italic">Acta sanctorum &hellip; Hiberniae</span> (1645) owed much to his efforts. Colgan's preface reveals that Ward would have seen the project through to publication but for his early death. He died on 8 November 1635, of dropsy, at the early age of forty-three. Throughout his life he had devoted much time to the study of the works of the philosopher John Duns Scotus and rejoiced at dying on his feast day. He was buried in Louvain.<br>
