<span class="headword">Theobald,  Lewis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1688, <em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">literary editor and writer</span>, the son of Peter Theobald (<i>d</i>. 1690), an attorney, and his second wife, Mary, was born in Sittingbourne, Kent, and baptized there on 2 April 1688.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>His godfather was Lewis Watson, third Baron Rockingham, and when Peter Theobald died in September 1690 Lewis was taken into the Rockingham household and educated with the sons of the family, chiefly by the Revd James Ellis, &#145;a very able schoolmaster&#146;, who ran a highly respected school in Isleworth, Middlesex, &#145;purely for grounding young Gentlemen, noblemen's sons or Gentlemen of some Rank, in Classick Learning, &amp; fitting them for the University&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae</span>, <span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 11.341; 2.9). Ellis gave Theobald a thorough grounding in Greek and Latin and, equally important, instilled in him a lifelong love of the scholarship that made classical literature accessible to modern readers. Theobald did not, however, attend university; he was apprenticed to an attorney, which contributed significantly to his skills as an editor of Shakespeare. His clerkship was before the act of 1729 regulating the training and practice of attorneys (2 Geo. II c. 23), when attorneys' bills were still written in court hand and clerks required the ability to read and write secretary script.<h2>
<a name="Lifeasamanofletters"></a>Life as a man of letters</h2>As an attorney Theobald might have prospered, but, as he acknowledged to Rockingham's daughter Lady Monson, &#145;If I have not made all the Advantages, which might have accrued from so favourable a Situation in Life, it is, that Nature had not done her Part, and all Soils are not equally susceptible of Improvement&#146;  (dedication, <span class="italic">The Happy Captive: an English Opera</span>, 1741, sig. A2<i>r</i>). Instead he set up as a man of letters while maintaining a desultory practice at law, settling in London, where he married and had a son, Lewis (the date of his marriage and his wife's name are unknown), and lived in Wyan's Court, Great Russell Street, in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields. In 1707, when he may still have been an apprentice-clerk, he published <span class="italic">A Pindaric Ode on the Union of Scotland and England</span> and <span class="italic">Naufragium Britannicum</span>, a poem dedicated to the memory of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell. The following year his <span class="italic">Persian Princess, or, The Royal Villain</span>, a tragedy written &#145;before I was full Nineteen Years Old&#146;  (dedication, <span class="italic">Persian Princess</span>, 1715, sig. A5<i>v</i>), was performed at Drury Lane. There were two performances, and the theatre managers granted him an unusual second night's benefit.<br>
<br>Theobald became a writer for Bernard Lintot, and his first production, <span class="italic">The Life and Character of Marcus Cato of Utica</span> (1713), drew upon the success of Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> (1713) and was followed by a translation of Plato's <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> (1713), which Cato is said to have read on the last night of his life. These works probably initiated his friendship with Addison and were followed by another translation, <span class="italic">Monsieur Le Clerc's Observations upon Mr. Addison's Travels through Italy</span> (1715). Anticipation of Alexander Pope's translation of Homer produced <span class="italic">A Critical Discourse upon the Iliad of Homer &hellip; by Monsieur de la Motte</span> (1714). Theobald also contracted with Lintot to translate the seven tragedies of Aeschylus, but the translation was never published. In April 1714 he undertook to translate into blank verse with annotations Homer's <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> (book 1, 1717), Sophocles' <span class="italic">Electra</span> (1714), <span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span> (1715), <span class="italic">Oedipus Coloneus</span>, <span class="italic">Trachiniae</span>, and the satires and epistles of Horace (all unpublished). After breaking with Lintot he continued with Aristophanes' <span class="italic">The Clouds</span> (1715) and <span class="italic">Plutus, or, The World's Idol</span> (1715), translated into colloquial prose and printed for Jonas Brown. Although he failed to establish himself with the public by these translations, those from Greek drama were &#145;highly esteemed&#146; by Richard Porson  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae</span>, 3.137 n. 1).<br>
<br>Theobald also published more poetry: <span class="italic">The Mausoleum, a Poem: Sacred to the Memory of her Late Majesty Queen Anne</span> (1714) was dedicated to Charles Boyle, fourth earl of Orrery, his most consistently generous patron (and, in the 1690s, the antagonist of Richard Bentley in the Phalaris controversy). Apart from passing tributes to Addison and Pope, both of whom Theobald admired at this time, the poem is unremarkable. On the other hand, <span class="italic">The Cave of Poverty, a Poem: Written in Imitation of Shakespeare</span> (1715) is interesting for its use of the stanza of <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> at a time when Shakespeare's poems were generally neglected. Theobald also launched <span class="italic">The Censor</span>, a tri-weekly periodical that ran from 11 April to 17 June 1715 (no. 30), ceased publication, and then resumed 1 January to 30 May 1717 (no. 96), with a second, collected edition in three volumes (1717).<br>
<br>The Shakespearian literary criticism found in <span class="italic">The Censor</span> is important for its emphasis on language and character at the expense of neo-Aristotelian concerns with plot and poetic justice. No. 7 (25 April 1715) is the first examination of <span class="italic">King Lear</span> in relation to its source in Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> (1577). Succeeding essays address the affective power of Shakespeare's language, psychology and motive of characters in relation to the moral significance of their actions, and the idea of poetic justice in relation to <i>hamartia</i> and the tragic emotions of pity and fear. <span class="italic">The Censor</span>'s radical independence from neo-Aristotelianism, anticipating the shift of critical focus in the late eighteenth century and beyond, is evident in no. 70 (2 April 1717):<blockquote>it is not to be expected that a Genius like <i>Shakespear</i>'s is to be judg'd by the Laws of <i>Aristotle</i>, and the other Prescribers to the Stage; it will be sufficient to fix a Character of Excellence to his Performances, if there are in them a Number of beautiful Incidents, true and exquisite Turns of Nature and Passion, fine and delicate Sentiments, uncommon Images, and great Boldnesses of Expression.</blockquote>Such enthusiasm for figurative language, unusual for its time, is desirable in an editor of Shakespeare and fundamental to Theobald's later success with conjectural emendation.<br>
<br>About 1715 Theobald began an association with John Rich's theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and in February 1716 <span class="italic">The Perfidious Brother</span> was produced. The play involved Theobald in controversy, because a watchmaker, Henry Mestayer, had given him a preliminary version of the play and then claimed that Theobald had plagiarized his work. Theobald believed that he had &#145;created [the play] anew: For even where the Original Matter is continued, I have brought it to Light, and drawn it as from a <i>Chaos</i>&#146;  (preface, <span class="italic">Perfidious Brother</span>, 1715, sig. A3<i>r</i>). Mestayer subsequently published a version of the play (1716), ironically dedicated to Theobald. Although Theobald evidently proceeded in good faith, the controversy is regrettable. His association with Rich's theatre had two benefits: he became assistant (and lifelong friend) to John Stede, Rich's prompter, and librettist for a series of operatic pantomimes, often loosely based on classical themes, in which Rich played the leading role of Harlequin.<br>
<br>As assistant to Stede, Theobald acquired precise knowledge of theatrical production and of dramatic manuscripts, especially prompt books, which led eventually to speculation about the nature of manuscript copy for Shakespearian quarto and folio texts. His activities as librettist gave him irregular but significant income in a life of fleeting affluence and financial crisis. Rich himself acknowledged that his &#145;Theatre has of late ow'd its Support in great Measure&#146; to pantomime  (<span class="italic">Rape of Proserpine, or, The Birth and Adventures of Harlequin</span>, 1727, dedication, v&#150;vi), and, indeed, the first two nights of <span class="italic">The Rape of Proserpine</span> brought in a staggering &pound;420 11<i>s</i>. The popular appeal of pantomime may well have suggested alternative principles of dramatic art to those rules prescribed by neo-Aristotelianism, or at least have reinforced Theobald's readiness to accept Shakespeare's neglect of them. Theobald had revised <span class="italic">Richard II</span> in 1719 as a neo-Aristotelian experiment, believing that its &#145;Beauties &hellip; would have stronger Charms if they were interwoven in a regular Fable &hellip; maintaining the <i>Unity</i> of <i>Action</i>, or supporting the <i>Dignity</i> of the <i>Characters</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Richard II</span>, 1720, preface, sig. Aa<i>r</i>), but the play's minimal success in the theatre gave no support to this theory.<h2>
<a name="Theobaldastextualcritic"></a>Theobald as textual critic</h2>Theobald's interest in Shakespeare was ultimately centred not on adaptation but on the recovery and explication of his &#145;genuine&#146; text, and when Pope's <span class="italic">Shakespear</span> (1725) appeared with a declaration that he had &#145;discharg'd the dull duty of an Editor&#146; to his &#145;best judgment&#146;  (1.xxii), Theobald was prompted to publish <span class="italic">Shakespeare restored, or, A specimen of the many errors as well committed, as unamended, by Mr. Pope in his late edition of this poet</span> (1726), the first critical book devoted to Shakespeare and evidently the product of much previous study. Apart from his title, Theobald is polite to Pope and, despite &#145;a Veneration, almost rising to Idolatry, for the Writings&#146; of Shakespeare, declares that he &#145;would be very loth even to do <i>him</i> Justice at the Expence of <i>that other</i> Gentleman's Character&#146;  (Theobald, <span class="italic">Restored</span>, iii). He insists, however, that it is the duty of an editor,<blockquote>Wherever he finds the Reading suspected, manifestly corrupted, deficient in Sense, and unintelligible &hellip; to exert every Power and Faculty of the Mind to supply such a Defect, to give Light and restore Sense to the Passage, and, by a reasonable Emendation, to make that satisfactory and consistent with the Context, which before was so absurd, unintelligible and intricate. (ibid., v)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Shakespeare Restored</span> devotes 132 pages to cruces in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and an appendix of 62 compressed pages to other plays. Theobald recognizes that successive editions were generally printed from their immediate predecessors, with the consequence that &#145;the more the Editions of any Book multiply, the more the Errors multiply too&#146;  (Theobald, <span class="italic">Restored</span>, ii&#150;iii). He inaugurates scholarly study of Shakespearian grammar and usage by means of parallel passages. Because he had the plays by heart, he was familiar with recurring patterns of imagery. His belief that Shakespeare wrote secretary script, &#145;the universal Character in our Author's Time&#146;  (Theobald, <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, 5.273n.), and his own &#145;Acquaintance with Stage-Books&#146;  (Theobald, <span class="italic">Restored</span>, 138) allowed him precisely to visualize manuscript copy and the kinds of misreading such copy might induce in a printed text. A principal test of conjectural emendation was that a proposed reading should be consistent with &#145;the Traces of the Letters&#146; (that is, with the <i>ductus litterarum</i>) of secretary script and Elizabethan orthography  (ibid.). These considerations are brought to bear on his famous emendation of the first folio's (1623) &#145;and a Table of greene fields&#146; found in the Hostess's description of the death of Falstaff (<span class="italic">Henry V</span>, <span class="smallcap">II</span>.iii.16&#150;17) &#145;&#151;for his Nose was as sharp as a Pen, and <i>a' babled</i> of green Fields&#146;  (Theobald, <span class="italic">Restored</span>, 138).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Shakespeare Restored</span> establishes many of the editorial principles and techniques found in Theobald's <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> (1733). It also fully exposed the inadequacies of Pope's <span class="italic">Shakespear</span>. Pope's initial printed response was in &#145;Fragment of a Satire&#146; (1728), where he gave Theobald the sobriquet &#145;pidling <i>Tibbalds</i>&#146;  (l. 14). He also included him among the swallows and eels in <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span> (1728), but his most sustained ridicule occurs in <span class="italic">The Dunciad Variorum</span> (1729). Pope's caricatures of Theobald are often self-portraits deriving from Pope's own experience as a translator and editor  (Seary, 87&#150;97), but the thrust of his attack is on Theobald's attention to the minutiae of texts, which he attempts to represent as proof of dullness. He sought also to represent Theobald's antiquarianism as evidence of lack of taste, because &#145;he laboured to prove <i>Shakespear</i> &hellip; conversant in such authors as <i>Caxton</i> and <i>Wynkin</i>, rather than in <i>Homer</i>&#146;  (A. Pope, <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>, 1.162&#150;3n.). Theobald's commentary does, of course, make full use of &#145;The Classicks of an Age that heard of none&#146;  (ibid., 1.128), but his concern in his explication of Shakespeare with &#145;all such reading as was never read&#146;  (ibid., 1.166) marks the beginning of modern scholarship devoted to Renaissance English literature.<br>
<br>Theobald responded good-humouredly to Pope's satire, declaring &#145;I ought to be very well satisfied with my Share of <i>Honours</i> in his Kingdom of <i>Dullness</i>&#146; and resolving to assert &#145;the Legality of my Master's Title to those Dominions, in which he exercises so free a Sway, and from whence he so unsparingly dispenses his <i>Promotions</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 17 April 1729). This he accomplished with further corrections of Pope's second edition of <span class="italic">Shakespear</span> (1728). He also began an extended commentary in the manner of <span class="italic">Shakespeare Restored</span>. During this work he was solicited by William Warburton to engage in a lengthy correspondence devoted to textual criticism as part of Warburton's manoeuvres to raise himself from his obscurity as a clergyman in the provinces. Meanwhile, a noble patron, probably the earl of Orrery, had presented Theobald with a manuscript of <span class="italic">Cardenio</span> by Shakespeare and Fletcher. Theobald acquired another two manuscripts and revised the play as <span class="italic">Double Falshood, or, The Distrest Lovers</span> (1728). Although enemies suggested that the play was a forgery, it was successful on stage, earning Theobald much-needed benefit nights. (Modern consensus is that <span class="italic">Double Falshood</span> is based on a lost play by Shakespeare and Fletcher.)<br>
<br>Public demand for an edition of Shakespeare by the author of <span class="italic">Shakespeare Restored</span> was now mounting. After the death of the poet laureate, Laurence Eusden, in 1730, an attempt was made to assist Theobald financially, when he &#145;would fain sit down to my little studies with an easy competency&#146;. Sir Robert Walpole, Lord Gage, and Frederick, prince of Wales, recommended him for the laureateship, although &#145;after standing fair for the post at least three weeks&#146; he finally &#145;had the mortification to be supplanted by Keyber&#146;  (letter, December 1730, Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 2.617). At a time when &#145;the Severity of a rich Creditor&#146; had stripped him &#145;so bare, that I never was acquainted with such Wants, since I knew the Use of Money&#146;  (letter, November 1731, Jones, 280), Jacob Tonson, the chief proprietor of Shakespearian copyrights, signed a contract (26 October 1731, Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 729), and in January 1734 Theobald's edition was published in seven volumes, and, with profits in excess of 1100 guineas, made Theobald the best paid of the early editors of Shakespeare. Among the subscribers were the prince and princess of Wales and most of the principal nobility. Theobald was vindicated from the aspersions of Pope. Even the <span class="italic">Grub-Street Journal</span>, which had been hostile, granted him &#145;the title, he so incontestably possesses, of the best English critic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grub-Street Journal</span>, 229, 16 May 1734). His text, with 1356 explanatory notes, was the most popular in the eighteenth century and reached nine editions by 1773.<br>
<br>The years immediately following publication of his <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> were the apex of Theobald's career. However, by 1737 his financial situation was again precarious, when Hogarth published his engraving of <span class="italic">The Distrest Poet</span> with the poet writing verses with a title alluding to Theobald's early poem, <span class="italic">The Cave of Poverty</span>, and Pope's verse portrait in <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> as a motto. (There is no known portrait of Theobald, but George Steevens speculated that Hogarth had caught his likeness  (see Richardson).) In 1741 he was again appealing to the public for support at a benefit night of <span class="italic">Double Falshood</span>. His last scholarly project was an edition of Beaumont and Fletcher in collaboration with Thomas Seward and John Sympson, published posthumously in 1750. He had continued to support a life of scholarship with a series of plays, adaptations, operas, and entertainments, of which the most successful was <span class="italic">Orpheus and Eurydice (with the Metamorphoses of Harlequin)</span> (1740).<br>
<br>Theobald died of jaundice at his house in Wyan's Court on 18 September 1744, attended by John Stede. According to Stede,<blockquote>He was of a generous spirit, too generous for his circumstances; and none knew how to do a handsome thing, or confer a benefit, when in his power, with a better grace than himself. He was my antient friend of near 30 years acquaintance. Interred at Pancras the 20th, 6 o'clock P.M. I only attended him. (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 2.745n.)</blockquote>There is no record of Theobald's burial in the parish registers. Beginning on 23 October, his library, which included the first folio (1623) and 29 pre-1623 quartos, was sold by auction over four nights in 631 lots, of which perhaps lot 460 is the most tantalizing:<blockquote>One hundred ninety-five old English Plays in Quarto, some of them so scarce as not to be had at any Price, <i>to many of which are Manuscript Notes and Remarks of</i> <i>Mr. Theobald's</i>, all done up neatly in Boards, in single Plays. (<span class="italic">Catalogue of the Library of Lewis Theobald, esq. Deceas'd</span> [1744])</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Influenceandreputation"></a>Influence and reputation</h2>Theobald made fundamental contributions to English scholarship and print culture. Although he adapted plays for the stage, his edition of Shakespeare marks a profound revolution in attitudes: first, Shakespeare clearly becomes an author to be studied, in addition to being heard on the stage; second, what Shakespeare wrote takes precedence over the taste of his editor, literary fashions, grammar, usage, and predilections of later readers. Recovery of Shakespeare's &#145;genuine&#146; text is established in Theobald's preface and notes for the first time as a specifically scholarly activity, separated as far as possible from literary criticism, which, in his then novel opinion, could only be practised when the text was reliable:<blockquote>The Science of Criticism, as far as it affects an Editor, seems to be reduced to these three Classes; the Emendation of corrupt Passages; the Explanation of obscure and difficult ones; and an Inquiry into the Beauties and Defects of Composition. This Work is principally confin'd to the two former Parts &hellip; the proper Objects of the Editor's Labour. The third lies open for every willing Undertaker. (preface, Theobald, <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, 1.xl&#150;xli)</blockquote>Separation of textual scholarship from literary criticism was essential not only for cultural history but for cultural continuity, which could only be effected by a reliable text with notes explaining obscurities of thought, allusions, and figurative language in the context of its times.Theobald's work was not always fully appreciated by his successors, and Johnson's denigration of him in his preface to <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> (1765) is to be regretted by all but the most uncritical of Johnson's adulators. Even Malone corrected Shakespeare's anachronisms, which Theobald refused to do. The chief fault of his edition is that it is based on Pope's, although he knew that the first quarto or folio texts were the basis of all succeeding editions. His choice of copy was, however, owing to legal regulation of copyright and required by Jacob Tonson. The range of his scholarship and the acumen and tact with which he applied it to the recovery and illumination of Shakespeare's texts have led modern critics and editors to characterize Theobald as &#145;the best all-round editor of Shakespeare in [his] period or any other&#146;  (Vickers, 1) and &#145;one of the finest editors of the last three centuries&#146;  (G. Taylor, in Wells, 54).<br>
