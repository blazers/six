<span class="headword">Akehurst, Sir  John Bryan</span>  (1930&#150;2007), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 12 February 1930 at Marlow, Harsted Avenue, Chatham, Kent, the only child of Geoffrey Guy Akehurst (1901&#150;1956), bank cashier, later bank manager, and his wife, Doris Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kerwin (1903&#150;1990). Educated at Cranbrook School, Kent, he enlisted in the army as a private soldier in 1947. The following year he was selected to attend the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst; he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Northamptonshire regiment on 16 December 1949. In 1952, after two years' service in Trieste, he volunteered to be seconded to the Malay regiment, serving as a lieutenant with its 5th battalion in operations against communist guerillas and gaining a mention in dispatches. With promotion to captain, he married, on 18 May 1955 in Malaya, Shirley Ann Webb (<i>b</i>. 1935/6), daughter of Major W. G. Webb, a Malayan civil servant. Their two children died young, of cystic fibrosis.<br>
<br>Between 1956 and 1960 Akehurst resumed duties with the Northamptonshire regiment, serving in Hong Kong and England. He attended the Staff College, Camberley, in 1961, earning a posting the following year as brigade major to 12 infantry brigade in the British army of the Rhine. In 1965 he was a company commander with the 2nd Royal Anglian regiment in Cyprus before being recalled to the staff college to join the directing staff there. Early in 1968, after two years at Camberley, he was given command of the 2nd Royal Anglian regiment. As part of 19 infantry brigade in the strategic reserve his battalion had to be ready to serve anywhere at short notice; and over the next two and a half years, besides participating in exercises in Cyprus, Kenya, and Malaysia, it was also called upon&#151;at a time of Spanish sabre-rattling in 1968&#150;9&#151;to reinforce Gibraltar. Between 1970 and 1974 he was successively on the directing staff of the Royal Defence College in London and, newly promoted to colonel, commandant of the junior division of the Staff College at Warminster. By now he had long been regarded as a man of promise: his confidential report acknowledged that while the best officers should appear able to do their job one-handed: &#145;With John, however, I have sometimes heard a whisper of &#147;Look, no hands!&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Generally Speaking</span>, 150).<br>
<br>In January 1974 Akehurst was chosen to command the Dhofar brigade in the sultan of Oman's service. The brigade, British-officered but otherwise comprising Omani and Baluchi troops, was embroiled in a nine-year-long civil war in Oman's Dhofar province against communist-inspired tribesmen backed by neighbouring South Yemen. After his arrival in south Arabia, a chance conversation with a Special Air Service non-commissioned officer, who told him that the <i>firqats</i>&#151;groups of rebels who had surrendered and taken up arms for the sultan&#151;were eager to return to their tribal areas, led Akehurst to initiate a strategy &#145;to secure Dhofar for civil development&#146;  (<span class="italic">We Won a War</span>, 65). He would capture rebel-held territory, drill water holes for the <i>firqats'</i> cattle, create the beginnings of villages, and&#151;after warning the <i>firqats</i> that if the rebels reappeared the water supply would be cut off&#151;left them to it. Writing to London on 4 November 1974, the British ambassador in Oman was enthusiastic: &#145;John Akehurst's decision to get the Firqat back into their own tribal areas and to take responsibility for them instead of sheltering in strong points &hellip; seems to be paying off&#146;  (TNA: PRO, FCO 8/2216). Later, in the final push for victory in October 1975, Akehurst showed his ability to exploit a fast-changing tactical situation. A diversionary attack launched from the mountain fastness of Sarfait having achieved unexpected results, he promptly ripped up his plans and reinforced success instead. &#145;Meet your flexible brigadier&#146;, he smilingly announced  (Jeapes, 223). The war was now won, although on Christmas day 1975 rebel gunfire was still capable of forcing down Akehurst's helicopter.<br>
<br>Akehurst moved to the Ministry of Defence as deputy military secretary in 1976 and, as a major-general, commanded 4th armoured division in Germany in 1979&#150;81. His subsequent term as commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, was considered notably successful. In 1984, on promotion to lieutenant-general as commander, United Kingdom field army, and inspector, general territorial army, he was created KCB. His last appointment, in 1987&#150;90, as a full general, was as deputy supreme allied commander Europe, &#145;the perfect bridge between working and not working&#146;, as Akehurst, who believed that the position carried little influence, described it  (<span class="italic">Generally speaking</span>, 208).<br>
<br>In retirement Akehurst wrote an amusing memoir, <span class="italic">Generally Speaking</span> (1999). He achieved wider public recognition as an expert on BBC TV's <span class="italic">Newsnight</span> during the Gulf War of 1990&#150;91. The <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, in a poll on the performance of war pundits in the media, awarded him 10/10. He lived at Dresden Cottage, 46 Vicarage Street, Warminster, Wiltshire, which he had bought in 1981. In retirement he was involved in many organizations, including as a member of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (1993&#150;8), chairman of the governors of Harrow School (1991&#150;7) and Princecroft primary school, Warminster (1995&#150;2000), and president of the Warminster Civic Trust (1998&#150;2007). He died on 20 February 2007 at the Royal United Hospital, Bath, after a stroke, and was survived by his wife, Shirley. A memorial service was held in the Royal Memorial Chapel, Sandhurst, on 3 June 2007.<br>
