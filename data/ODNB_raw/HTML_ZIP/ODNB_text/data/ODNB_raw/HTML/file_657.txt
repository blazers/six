<span class="headword">Armstrong,  James</span>  (1780&#150;1839), <span class="occ">non-subscribing Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Ballynahinch, co. Down. He was the son of John Armstrong, Presbyterian minister of Ballynahinch (1744&#150;80), and his wife, who was a daughter of the Revd John Strong. He was descended from John Livingstone, of Killinchy, one of the founders of Irish Presbyterianism.<br>
<br>Armstrong was first trained at the Rademon Academy, under Moses Neilson DD, and then became classical assistant to William Bruce DD at Belfast Academy, where he taught a special class in sacred history. After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, he studied philosophy at the University of Edinburgh under Dugald Stewart. He was licensed to preach on 11 May 1806 by Antrim presbytery (non-subscribing). In the same year he was offered Clonmel and Strand Street, Dublin; choosing the latter, he was ordained on 25 December 1806 by Dublin presbytery (non-subscribing), where he first worked with John Moody (1742&#150;1813) and then, from 25 December 1815, with William Hamilton Drummond (1778&#150;1865). He married, on 26 September 1811, Mary, daughter of George Allman, of Bandon, co. Cork. They had four daughters and two sons, John Armstrong, president of the Dublin Historical Society, and the Revd George Allman Armstrong, originally a barrister, who succeeded him in 1841 at Strand Street.<br>
<br>In 1829 Armstrong published <span class="italic">A Discourse on Presbyterian Ordination</span> and &#145;An Appendix, Containing some Account of the Presbyterian Churches in Dublin&#146;, which consisted of short biographies of Irish Presbyterians; both publications were included as an appendix to <span class="italic">The Ordination Service &hellip; of the Rev. James Martineau</span>. In 1830 he helped to found the Irish Unitarian Society and in 1835 the Association of Irish Nonsubscribing Presbyterians, which he also represented at the tercentenary of the Reformation celebrations held in Geneva in August 1835. In 1834 he had received the degree of DD from the University of Geneva and had been admitted as a member of the Royal Irish Academy. His published works include several sermons, as well as the <span class="italic">Appendix</span>, for which he is best known. He died very suddenly, probably of a heart attack, at Stonehouse, Stillorgan Road, Dublin, on Wednesday, 4 December 1839, having preached on the previous Sunday, and married a couple that very morning. He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. A petition from his widow is printed in the parliamentary debates on the <span class="roman">Dissenters' Chapels Bill</span>.<br>
