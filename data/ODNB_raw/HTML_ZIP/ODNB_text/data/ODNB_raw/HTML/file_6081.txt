<span class="headword">Conn na mBocht</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1060), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical leader</span>, was &#145;head of the C&eacute;ili D&eacute; [Culdees, literally &#147;servants of God&#148;] and anchorites of Clonmacnoise&#146;, though he is sometimes mistakenly called bishop of Clonmacnoise on the basis of a misinterpretation of an entry in <span class="italic">Chronicum Scotorum</span> for the year 948. His death is likewise sometimes given as 1031, on the basis of an entry in the annals of the four masters, mistakenly assumed to be an obit. His name is the eponym of the Meic Cuinn na mBocht family, one of the best documented in early medieval Ireland below the top ranks of royalty, though two versions of their dynastic origin are recorded, one linking them with U&iacute; Chellaig, the royal family of Brega, the other, perhaps more likely, with the Mugdorna Maigen of Airgialla. They are occasionally called Muinter Gorm&aacute;in, after the abbot of Louth who died on pilgrimage in Clonmacnoise in 758, or Cen&eacute;l Torbaig, after the latter's famous son, Torbach (<i>d</i>. 808), abbot of Armagh and the person for whom the <span class="roman">Book of Armagh</span> was written.<br>
<br>Torbach's son &Aacute;edac&aacute;n was abbot of Louth but died in Clonmacnoise in 835, and the family were thereafter firmly fixed at Clonmacnoise, &Aacute;edac&aacute;n's grandson Luchair&eacute;n being the first member of Conn na mBocht's ancestry specifically recorded as one of its scribes. Successive members of the family held prominent posts there, Conn's great-grandfather D&uacute;nadach (<i>d</i>. 955) being bishop, and his grandfather D&uacute;nchad being &#145;lector of Clonmacnoise, and its anchorite afterwards, head of its rule and history&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1005). Although Conn's own father, Ioseph (<i>d</i>. 1024), was described simply as <i>anmchara Cluana mic N&oacute;is</i> (&#145;confessor [literally &#147;soul-friend&#148;] of Clonmacnoise&#146;; <span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1022), there is more than enough evidence to demonstrate that the family had a long tradition as scribes and historians, a tradition that extended beyond Conn. The latter's grandson, for instance, was the principal scribe of <span class="italic">Lebor na hUidre</span>, containing the oldest text of the T&aacute;in, where an entry requests &#145;a prayer for M&aacute;el Muire mac C&eacute;ilechair, grandson of Conn na mBocht, who copied and searched out this book from various books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lebor na hUidre</span>, fol. 37b). The family probably also maintained the annals at Clonmacnoise, which would account for the detailed and flattering entries about them recorded through the ages.<br>
<br>Conn himself was head of the C&eacute;ili D&eacute;, who, when they first appeared in the eighth century, were individuals or groups subject to a monastic rule, apparently with observances stricter than those of others; but by the eleventh century the term is synonymous, or nearly so, with the monastic poor, <i>na boicht</i>, individuals inhabiting monastic lands who may or may not have taken vows of poverty. In Armagh, the person charged with looking after the poor was called <i>cenn bocht</i>, &#145;head of the poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 1074, 1077), a title also given to Conn's son and successor at Clonmacnoise, from which it may be assumed that Conn had served the same function.<br>
<br>The Four Masters state that &#145;the reason he was called Conn na mBocht is because of the number of poor that he used to feed habitually&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, 807), and the evidence suggests that he enjoyed considerable wealth since the annals of the four masters records for 1031 that he was &#145;the first to assemble a herd for the poor of Clonmacnoise&#146; (though O'Donovan oddly translates this as &#145;the first that invited a party of the poor&#146;), and presented twenty cows of his own to it. They were maintained at &Iacute;sel Chiar&aacute;in (Twyford, Westmeath), a church situated quite some distance north of Clonmacnoise, which had been in its possession for many generations and was by tradition the location of St Ciar&aacute;n's first settlement in the area. It became the possession of Conn's family in the eleventh century: a verse couplet in the annals of the four masters for 1031, on the subject of Conn, seems to have &Iacute;sel Chiar&aacute;in in mind when it refers to <i>do chill</i>, &#145;your church&#146;, while the same source for 1089 records that it &#145;was purchased for ever by Cormac Mac Cuinn na mBocht&#146; (Conn's grandson) from the abbot of Clonmacnoise and the king of Mide. The annals of Clonmacnoise, in describing an event that belongs to 1072, likewise mention &#145;the family of Moylekyeran m<sup>c</sup> Con ne mboght in Isillkyeran and the poore of that house&#146;. The same source calls it &#145;Isill Kieran or the hospitall of St. Queran&#146;, which is perhaps an indication of one of the functions the family served there.<br>
<br>These notices seem to confirm that, under the stewardship of Conn and his immediate successors, &Iacute;sel Chiar&aacute;in, once an important possession of Clonmacnoise, was transformed into an independent church, run by a hereditary ecclesiastical family, and, by virtue of its &#145;purchase&#146; from both king and abbot, exempted from secular and ecclesiastical authority and taxation. This must have been largely Conn's achievement since, although the annalists are almost totally silent about him, they view him as an apical figure and are very anxious to link others to him by either ancestry or descent. The verse couplet commemorating him gives some idea of his status: &#145;O Conn of Cluain, thou wert heard from Ireland in Scotland; O head of dignity, it will not be easy to plunder thy church&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1031). He died, as &#145;the glory and dignity of Clonmacnoise&#146;, in 1060 &#145;at an advanced age&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1060). A tombstone with the inscription &#145;Or[&oacute;it] do Chuinn&#146; (&#145;a prayer for Conn&#146;) was still visible when George Petrie visited Clonmacnoise in the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Conn had at least five sons: C&eacute;lechair Mugdornach, who died as bishop of Clonmacnoise in 1067; M&aacute;el Chiar&aacute;in (<i>d</i>. 1079), abbot of Clonmacnoise, who paved two roads there and whose inscribed gravestone Petrie also recorded; M&aacute;el Finn&eacute;n, who predeceased his father in 1056 but who was deemed important enough for his obit to record his genealogy, whose son Cormac later held the abbacy or vice-abbacy, and whose gravestone Petrie also noted; Gilla Cr&iacute;st, &#145;the best cleric's son that was in Ireland in his time, the glory and ornament of Clonmacnoise&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1085); and M&aacute;el &Iacute;su (<i>d</i>. 1103).<br>
