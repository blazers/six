<span class="headword">William, Prince</span>, duke of Gloucester  (1689&#150;1700), <span class="occ"></span>was born on 24 July 1689 at Hampton Court, Middlesex, the third child and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/560/', "Anne (1665&#150;1714)")</script>, later queen of Great Britain and Ireland, and her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10543/', "George, prince of Denmark and duke of Cumberland (1653&#150;1708)")</script>. On the day of his baptism, 27 July 1689, he was declared duke of Gloucester by his uncle William III, although the creation was never formalized; the report of his baptism in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> states that he was named William, but he is called in other sources William Henry. The birth of a healthy child to Anne was presented as an endorsement by providence of the revolution of 1688, which now had its protestant heir to counterbalance the Catholic James Francis Edward, infant son of the exiled James II and thus also Gloucester's uncle.<br>
<br>Anne's two daughters had died in 1687 and she had also endured four other unsuccessful pregnancies before Gloucester was born. Consequently when he was seized with convulsions in September 1689 few expected him to live. However, he rallied, following treatment with bark by John Radcliffe. He was well enough to be moved from Whitehall to Kensington for convalescence, first to Craven House and then in 1690 to Campden House, which became his residence until 1698, with Barbara Berkeley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Villiers, Viscountess Fitzhardinge, as his governess. He remained physically frail, and during his first few years suffered from repeated attacks of malarial fever. He had difficulty walking until he was five and for a long time was unable to rise without assistance if he fell. This affliction was blamed by some on the over-protective attitude of his lady attendants and by others on the size of his head, which his attendant Jenkin Lewis thought &#145;was occasioned by the issue in his pole, that had been kept running&#146; since his illness as a baby, &#145;which made it difficult to fit his head with a peruke&#146;  (Lewis, 12). Some commentators have seen this condition as evidence of hydrocephalus, although this is not certain. His frailty did not prevent him from being presented in the press and to the political world as the eventual heir of his aunt and uncle; Mary II's regular visits and present-giving were widely reported. After Mary's death in 1694 Gloucester moved closer to the throne, and the cultivation of his public identity became more important. His sixth birthday, on 24 July 1695, was the first court festival following Mary's death, occasioning Henry Purcell's last royal ode. He was appointed KG on 9 January 1696 and was installed in person at Windsor on 25 July.<br>
<br>Brought up in an outpost of a court preoccupied by war, it was not surprising that Gloucester became obsessed with military matters. He paid close attention to his uncle's campaigns during the Nine Years' War, and from about 1693 he was entertained by a group of boys from Kensington who dressed and paraded as soldiers at Campden House. Their numbers grew from twenty-two to over ninety within a couple of years, and included the sons of court families. Gloucester's &#145;army&#146; became an accepted part of court ceremonial during his lifetime, particularly on royal birthdays and protestant festivals such as the anniversary of the birth of Elizabeth I.<br>
<br>By 1696 Gloucester seems to have enjoyed generally good health. Lewis noted that he &#145;began to be more wary in what he said; and would not talk openly, as he was accustomed to do, but now and then would out with shrewd, comical expressions&#146;  (Lewis, 95), although he was still &#145;careless at meals&#146; and had to be fed by his nurse Mrs Atkinson, suggesting continuing co-ordination problems. In December 1697, however, William III awarded &pound;20,000 from the civil list towards Gloucester's household, and in June 1698 John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, was appointed his governor and Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, his preceptor. Apart from Burnet the household mainly consisted of supporters of Princess Anne, but William seems to have intended to use the settlement to bind Anne and her son as far as possible to his foreign and domestic agenda.<br>
<br>Gloucester was now settled in St James's Palace and gradually took a larger role in public life. In March 1699 he attended the trial for murder of Charles Mohun, fourth Baron Mohun, and Edward Rich, sixth earl of Warwick, with his uncle and parents. From June foreign diplomats were required to have audiences with him. In July 1700 his status was further enhanced when he was given Mary II's apartments in Kensington Palace, more closely associating him with William.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1700, three days after his eleventh birthday was celebrated at Windsor, Gloucester fell ill with suspected smallpox. He died there on 30 July 1700 and, after lying in state in a chamber in Westminster Hall, was buried on 9 August in the Henry VII chapel, Westminster Abbey. His death was a shock; though it has become conventional to characterize Gloucester as permanently disabled he seems to have been a vigorous boy&#151;Burnet wrote that in the two years that he was Gloucester's preceptor &#145;he had made an amazing progress in his lessons&#146;  (Loftie, 11)&#151;and by 1700 it had been long expected that he would reach adulthood. A succession crisis ensued, which led to the passing in England of the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> in 1701, settling the throne on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her protestant heirs. Jenkin Lewis had written a memoir of his service with Gloucester, following his resignation in 1697, giving unrivalled details of Gloucester's upbringing and the jockeying for position around him within the household. This was found among the manuscripts of Bernard Gates, master of the children of the Chapel Royal, by Philip Hayes, who edited it for publication in 1789. Another edition, edited by William John Loftie, appeared in 1881.<br>
