<span class="headword">Garratt,  Herbert William</span>  (1864&#150;1913), <span class="occ">locomotive engineer</span>, was born on 8 June 1864 at 11 Loddiges Road, Hackney, London, the son of William Garratt, umbrella manufacturer, and his wife, Emma Hunt. He was educated at private schools in London, then served his apprenticeship from 1879 to 1882 in the locomotive works in Bow. From there he went to Doxford's marine engine works in Sunderland, after which he served at sea as fourth and third engineer on several steamships. From 1885 to 1889 he acquired more railway-engineering experience, first as an inspector of engines and railway materials for C. Douglas Fox and Alexander Rendel respectively, then on the London and South Western Railway in conjunction with the Vacuum Brake Company.<br>
<br>From 1889 to 1906 Garratt worked on railways in many other countries: the Central Argentine Railway appointed him district locomotive superintendent in 1894, but in 1897 he was summarily dismissed for being late in returning from leave in England; in 1900 he went as locomotive superintendent to the Cuban Central Railways, in 1902 to the Lagos Government Railway, and in 1904 to the Lima Railways in Peru. In this way he acquired an unusually wide experience of railway engineering and management under difficult conditions. During those periods of service on overseas railways he made a special study of existing types of articulated locomotive, such as the Fairlie, Meyer, and Mallet, and the problems involved in achieving, especially on narrow-gauge track, adequate stability, traction, and speed. His first sketches of the Garratt articulated locomotive show that he appreciated the advantages of mounting the boiler centrally between a pair of driving bogies carrying the fuel and water tanks. He applied for a patent for his design on 26 July 1907.<br>
<br>After his ideas had been rejected by Kitsons, the locomotive builders of Leeds, Garratt was fortunate in gaining the support of Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co. in Manchester, who saw the inherent superiority of his design concept. After some initial problems had been overcome the Garratts were outstandingly successful, running on all gauges from 2 feet to 5 feet 6 inches on gradients up to 1 in 20 or more, usually at modest speeds on heavily curved and graded routes, but capable of 75&#150;80 m.p.h. on the Algerian expresses which were headed by probably the fastest articulated locomotives (4&#150;6&#150;2+2&#150;6&#150;4) ever built. A total of 1636 Garratts ran on eighty-six railways in forty-eight countries: of these, Beyer Peacock built just over 1000. Between November 1885 and February 1913 he took out nine patents, eight relating to locomotive engines and one for &#145;an improved egg-opener&#146;.<br>
<br>Garratt was elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1902. He died at his home, 9 Ellerker Gardens, Richmond, Surrey, on 25 September 1913.<br>
