<span class="headword">Strachey, Sir  Edward</span>, third baronet  (1812&#150;1901), <span class="occ">religious and philosophical writer</span>, was born on 12 August 1812 at Sutton Court, Pensford, near Bristol, Somerset, the son of <a href="#cosubject_64296">Edward Strachey [<i>see below</i>]</a> and his wife, Julia Woodburn (1789/90&#150;1846), daughter of Colonel William Kirkpatrick. Sutton Court was the seat of his old Somerset family, which was closely involved with India for three generations.<br>
<br>The senior <a name="cosubject_64296"></a><span class="headword">Edward Strachey</span>  (1774&#150;1832), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born on 18 December 1774, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26621/', "Sir Henry Strachey, first baronet (1736&#150;1810)")</script>, Lord Clive's private secretary in India, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1824), daughter of John Kelsall and widow of Captain Thomas Latham RN. He was educated at Westminster School from 1783 and St Andrews University from 1791, and in 1793 went to Bengal in the East India Company's service. He held a succession of diplomatic and judicial posts, and became a close friend of Mountstuart Elphinstone, who said that in his early days he owed much to Strachey's advice and example  (Colebrooke, 2.309). In 1801 the two were appointed to the staff of Colonel William Kirkpatrick, the British resident at the Maratha court, and they journeyed overland from Calcutta to Poona for nearly a year  (ibid., 1.22&#150;36). Strachey eventually became a judge of the provincial court of appeal at Dacca (1810). At Calcutta on 13 October 1808 he married Kirkpatrick's youngest daughter, Julia Woodburn. They returned to England in 1811 and lived at Sutton Court.<br>
<br>In 1815 Strachey resigned from the Bengal service, and in 1820 he was appointed an examiner at East India House, London, where his colleagues included James Mill and his son John Stuart Mill&#151;whose utilitarian philosophy Strachey shared&#151;and Thomas Love Peacock. The Stracheys moved to Fitzroy Square, London, with a summer residence at Goodenough House, Shooter's Hill, Kent. They became well acquainted with Edward Irving and Thomas Carlyle, who acted as tutor to Julia Strachey's nephew. Carlyle left amusing descriptions of them in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>  (especially pp. 246 ff., 267 ff.), according to which Strachey was &#145;rather tacit than discursive&#146;, and devoted to Chaucer. He had also been greatly impressed by ancient Indian achievements in algebra, the subject of his only publications, a translation of a Persian version of a Sanskrit algebraic treatise by Bhaskara Acharya (<span class="italic">Bija Ganita, or, The Algebra of the Hindus</span> [1813]), and an article, &#145;On the early history of algebra&#146;  (<span class="italic">Asiatic Researches</span>, 12, 1818, 160&#150;85). Edward Strachey died at Shooter's Hill on 3 January 1832. He and his wife, who died on 20 November 1847, had one daughter and six sons. Of the younger sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36341/', "Sir Richard Strachey")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36339/', "Sir John Strachey")</script> were civil servants in India. William Strachey also pursued an Indian career, and the youngest son, George, became a diplomat.<br>
<br>The eldest son, Edward, had also been destined for India and attended the East India College, Haileybury (1829&#150;30), but his career hopes were destroyed by arthritis of the knee, which forced him to use crutches for more than twenty years. He was said to have been eventually cured by the waters of Ischia when he was on one of several visits to Italy, but by then he was over forty and his knee always remained stiff. In the hope of entering a university (which in the end his disability prevented) he spent most of 1836 reading philosophy and related subjects with F. D. Maurice at Guy's Hospital, where Maurice was chaplain. Strachey had been attracted by Maurice's <span class="italic">Subscription No Bondage</span> (1835), and obtained an introduction through John Sterling, a friend of Julia Strachey. Maurice became his spiritual adviser for many years and under his influence he became firmly attached to the Church of England, but opposed to most high-church doctrines and practices, and sympathetic to nonconformists; his opinions in his early days were in advance of contemporary orthodoxy. He began writing on religious subjects in 1843, with a commentary on the Church of England marriage service, and&#151;also under Maurice's influence&#151;developed a liking for biblical criticism, for which he learned Hebrew. One result of this was <span class="italic">Hebrew Politics in the Time of Sargon and Sennacherib</span> (1853; revised as <span class="italic">Jewish History and Politics</span>, 1874), on the background to the prophecies of Isaiah. He also published <span class="italic">Miracles and Science</span> (1854), and later collaborated with Maurice on <span class="italic">Politics Ancient and Modern</span> (1861) for the <span class="roman">Tracts for Priests and People</span>. With his mother's fascination for religion he combined his father's literary, philosophical, and oriental interests, as seen in his <span class="italic">Shakespeare's &#145;Hamlet&#146;: an Attempt to Find a Key to a Great Moral Problem</span> (1848) and occasional translations from Persian poems.<br>
<br>On 27 August 1844 Strachey married Elisabeth, eldest daughter of the Revd W. Wilkieson, of Woodbury Hall, Bedfordshire; when she died childless on 11 April 1855 he collected and edited her <span class="italic">Translations from the French of &Eacute;mile Souvestre</span> (1856). His second wife, whom he married on 3 November 1857, was Mary Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1883), second daughter of the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26887/', "John Addington Symonds (1807&#150;1871)")</script>, and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sykes. Mary Isabella was sister to the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26888/', "John Addington Symonds (1840&#150;1893)")</script> and to Charlotte Byron Symonds, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48416/', "Charlotte Byron Green")</script>, a promoter of higher education for women who married the philosopher T. H. Green. On 11 April 1858 Strachey succeeded his father's unmarried elder brother, Sir Henry Strachey, second baronet, who had also followed a judicial career in Bengal. The rest of Sir Edward's life was divided between his literary activities and his responsibilities in Somerset, where he was an active magistrate and deputy lieutenant, and in 1864 served as high sheriff. He was also a poor-law guardian and a member of the first Somerset county council. A Liberal of a somewhat idealistic type, he took a warm interest in the welfare of his tenants, especially the working class; he was an admirer of Gladstone, and in 1870 wrote a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> on the proposed Irish land bill, using material supplied by his friend and neighbour Chichester Fortescue, afterwards Lord Carlingford. Other later works included the Globe edition of Malory's <span class="italic">Morte d'Arthur</span> (1868), a memoir of his father's colleague Thomas Love Peacock for the last volume of Richard Garnett's edition of Peacock's prose works (1891), and an introduction to Lear's <span class="italic">Nonsense Songs</span> (1895); he also wrote <span class="italic">Talk at a Country House</span> (1895), in which, according to him, the imaginary &#145;Squire&#146; represents his mature thought, and &#145;Forster&#146; the ideas of his younger days. He contributed articles to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, and other periodicals.<br>
<br>Strachey's second wife died on 5 October 1883, leaving a daughter and three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36336/', "Edward Strachey, first Baron Strachie")</script>, politician; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36340/', "John St Loe Strachey")</script>, editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>; and Henry, an artist, who painted two portraits of his father. Strachey himself died at Sutton Court on 24 September 1901 and was buried in Chew Magna churchyard, Somerset.<br>
