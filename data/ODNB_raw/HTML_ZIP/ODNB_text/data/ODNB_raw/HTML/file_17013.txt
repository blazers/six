<span class="headword">Lord,  John Keast</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em> the Wanderer]</span>  (1818&#150;1872), <span class="occ">naturalist and traveller</span>, was probably born in Cornwall, the son of Edward Lord. He was taken to Tavistock, Devon, with his brother, William Barry Lord, and educated by an uncle named Luscombe, a man of some local position. About 1840 Lord was apprenticed to Edgecombe and Stannes, chemists, in Tavistock, and afterwards entered the Royal Veterinary College, London, on 4 November 1842. He received his diploma (MRCVS) on 29 May 1844 and established himself as a veterinary surgeon at Tavistock, but his convivial tastes led him astray, and he suddenly disappeared. He is said to have made a whaling voyage and been shipwrecked, and to have been for some years a trapper in Minnesota and the Hudson's Bay fur countries. On 19 June 1855 he was appointed to the British army in the East as a veterinary surgeon with local rank, and attached to the artillery of the Turkish contingent, with which he served in the Crimea. He received the rank of lieutenant on 4 January 1856. In August of that year he was acting as veterinary surgeon with local rank and senior lieutenant of the Osmanli horse artillery.<br>
<br>When British Columbia was formed into a colony after the gold discoveries on the Fraser River in 1858, Lord was appointed (1 February 1858) naturalist to the British North American boundary commission sent out to run a boundary line along the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, separating the new colony from United States territory. He was detached to San Francisco to buy mules, and to his skill and energy the success of the transport arrangements of the expedition was largely due. He lived for some time at Vancouver Island, but returned to England on 14 July 1862. The valuable collections he made of mammals, birds, fishes, insects, and other specimens are now in the Natural History Museum, London. Two new mammals, a muskrat which he called <i>Fiber osoyooensis</i> and another animal, related to the hare and the rabbit, which he called <i>Lagomys minimus</i>, were described by him in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span> (1863, 95&#150;8), where he argued that these should be classified as new species rather than simply varieties. In the same year, dressed in the garb of a trapper, he delivered lectures entitled &#145;The canoe, the rifle, and the axe&#146; at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London, and there he became acquainted with the naturalist Francis Trevelyan Buckland. At Buckland's suggestion Lord became a contributor to <span class="italic">The Field</span>, and joined the staff of Buckland's journal, <span class="italic">Land and Water</span>, on its establishment on 1 January 1866.<br>
<br>Subsequently Lord was employed by the viceroy in archaeological and scientific researches in Egypt. While there he made many observations on snakes and exposed the tricks of the snake charmers, who, seeing his dexterity in handling venomous snakes made him a &#145;sheikh&#146; of their craft. He brought to London collections of remains from ancient mines and sent them back to Egypt after arranging them. Catalogues of collections of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera formed by him in Egypt were published in London in 1871. Lord was appointed the first manager of the Brighton aquarium, which was opened on 10 August 1872, but four months later, on 9 December, he died aged fifty-four at his home, 17 Dorset Gardens, Brighton. His friend Buckland described him as a big, unostentatious, large-hearted man, a delightful companion, and a first-rate practical naturalist.<br>
<br>Lord's most enduring work was perhaps <span class="italic">The Naturalist in Vancouver Island and British Columbia</span> (2 vols., 1866), at the end of which are lists of his collections in north-west America. He also wrote, under the pseudonym of the Wanderer, <span class="italic">At Home in the Wilderness</span> (1867, 2nd edn, 1876), and helped in an enlarged edition of Francis Galton's <span class="italic">Art of Travel</span> (new edn, 1867). In addition he was a contributor to the <span class="italic">Leisure Hour</span>, <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>, the <span class="italic">Intellectual Observer</span>, and other journals, and as the Wanderer contributed many papers on sea fisheries and other topics to <span class="italic">Land and Water</span>, which for a short time he edited as Buckland's substitute.<br>
