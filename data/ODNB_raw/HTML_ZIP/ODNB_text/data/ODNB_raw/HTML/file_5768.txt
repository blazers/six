<span class="headword">Trotter <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Cockburn]</span>,  Catharine</span>  (1674?&#150;1749), <span class="occ">playwright and philosopher</span>, was born in High Holborn, London, probably on 16 August 1674, the second of the two daughters of David Trotter (<i>d</i>. 1684), naval captain, and his wife, Sarah Bellenden, who was related to Lord Bellenden and the earls of Perth and Lauderdale. Katherine Trotters, the daughter of David and Sarah Trotters, was baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 29 August 1674. This is five years earlier than the date of birth given by Thomas Birch in his life of Trotter, and that recorded on her gravestone, but is probably correct. Her parents were both Scottish. Captain Trotter served under Charles II, but died of the plague while on a voyage to Iskenderun, losing all his effects. His widow was granted a pension by Charles II, which ceased at that king's death, and was not renewed until the accession of Queen Anne in 1702.<br>
<br>Catharine Trotter apparently learned to write and to speak French by her own efforts, but according to the biographical summary, &#145;The life of Mrs Cockburn&#146;, written by Thomas Birch, the editor of <span class="italic">The Works of Mrs. Catharine Cockburn</span>, she &#145;had some assistance in the study of the Latin grammar and Logic&#146;  (Birch, 1.v). It is not clear whence that assistance came. Her first published work was an epistolary novella, <span class="italic">The Adventures of a Young Lady</span>, her anonymous contribution to a collection published by Samuel Briscoe entitled <span class="italic">Letters of Love and Gallantry and Several other Subjects, All Written by Ladies</span> (2 vols., 1693&#150;4, vol. 1). Although anonymous in this edition, the novella, retitled <span class="italic">Olinda's Adventures, or, The Amours of a Young Lady</span>, was attributed to Mrs Trotter in a 1718 collection published by Briscoe: <span class="italic">Familiar Letters of Love, Gallantry and Several Occasions</span>. Her novella is superior in construction and style to the general run of letter fiction in this period.<br>
<br>Trotter wrote five plays, which were all performed on the London stage. About December 1695 her first play, <span class="italic">Agnes de Castro</span>, was performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London. This was followed by <span class="italic">Fatal Friendship</span>, which was performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1698. Among her contemporaries, the latter was the most acclaimed of her plays. Charles Gildon stated that &#145;it deserv'd the Applause it met with&#146;  (Gildon, 179). George Farquhar wrote to her &#145;my passions were wrought so high by the representation of <span class="italic">Fatal Friendship</span>, and since raised so by a sight of the beautiful author&#146;  (BL, Birch Add. MS 4264, fol. 102). Her only comedy, <span class="italic">Love at a Loss</span>, was performed in November 1700 at Drury Lane, and includes a generous dedication to her patron, the poet Sarah, Lady Piers. This play was later revised and retitled <span class="italic">The Honourable Deceivers</span>, but was unperformed and no manuscript copies have survived. Her next play, a tragedy, <span class="italic">The Unhappy Penitent</span>, was staged at Drury Lane in February 1701. After a five-year gap during which she had published her first philosophical work, her last play, also a tragedy, <span class="italic">The Revolution of Sweden</span>, was produced about February 1706, at the Queen's Theatre at the Haymarket. She had previously shown the manuscript of this play to William Congreve for his suggestions, most of which she did not incorporate in the final version.<br>
<br>Trotter's dramatic work was in many ways in the vanguard of the movement to reform the stage, which gained momentum in the eighteenth century. In the dedication to <span class="italic">Fatal Friendship</span> she stated that the intention of the play was to &#145;discourage vice, and recommend a firm unshaken virtue&#146;. Contemporary comment often centred on her ability to entertain and instruct in her drama, as in this anonymous reference to <span class="italic">Fatal Friendship</span>: &#145;A celebrated Female in use, has lately convinc'd you, in her <span class="italic">Fatal Friendship</span>, that 'tis possible to entertain, with all the Judgment, Wit and Beauty of Poetry; without <i>shocking our senses</i>, with intollerable prophaness [<i>sic</i>] or obscenity&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter to Mr. Congreve on his Pretended Amendments etc. of Mr. Collier's Short View of the Immorality and Prophaneness of the English Stage</span>, 1698, 36&#150;7). Acclaim for her writing was often conflated with praise for her beauty. Birch described her as &#145;small of stature, but had a remarkable liveliness in her eye, and delicacy of complexion&#146;  (Birch, 1.xlvi). Gildon praised her for &#145;two things rarely found together, Wit and Beauty: and with these a Penetration very uncommon in the Sex&#146;  (Gildon, 179). Her drama is notable in this period for its unusually rational and politically aware female characters. Although Trotter denied alliance to any political group, she was closely involved with the very politically active Marlborough circle in the early eighteenth century  (Kelley, 21), and a close associate of Bishop Burnet and his third wife, Elizabeth, a friend of Sarah Churchill.<br>
<br>In 1702 Trotter published her first, and best-known, philosophical piece, the anonymous <span class="italic">A Defence of the &#145;Essay of Human Understanding&#146;, Written by Mr. Lock</span>, defending him from the charges of deism and Socinianism which had been levelled at him anonymously in <span class="italic">Remarks</span> by Dr Thomas Burnet of the Charterhouse in 1697. Elizabeth Burnet, a friend of John Locke, revealed Trotter's authorship to the philosopher, encouraging him to demonstrate his appreciation by gifts of money and books. Subsequently, Trotter published <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning a Guide in Controversies</span> (1707), prefaced by remarks by Bishop Gilbert Burnet. This marked her return to the Anglican faith after several years as a practising Roman Catholic.<br>
<br>In 1708 Trotter married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5775/', "Revd Patrick Cockburn (1678&#150;1749)")</script>, eldest son of Dr John Cockburn. After her marriage she moved from London to Nayland, Suffolk, where her husband had a curacy. In February 1713 he became curate of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, but lost his appointment as he refused to take the oath of abjuration on the accession of George I. In 1726 he was persuaded by his father and Lord Chancellor King to take the oath, and was granted the ministry of the episcopal congregation of St Paul's Chapel in Aberdeen. Subsequently, he was also granted the living of Long Horsley, near Morpeth in Northumberland, although he did not reside there until the bishop of Durham insisted in 1737. He was the incumbent of this parish until his death, on 4 January 1749.<br>
<br>Trotter's later important publications were all concerned with philosophical issues, where she consistently opposed ethical schemes based on voluntarism or moral relativity, in favour of a theistic belief in intrinsic essential moral differences within the law of nature. Her consistent position was that moral principles are not innate, but discoverable by each individual through the use of the faculty of reason endowed by God. She was a lifelong adherent to John Locke's philosophical principles, in 1726 publishing <span class="italic">A Letter to Dr. Holdsworth</span>, defending Locke against Winch Holdsworth's allegations of heresy. A further vindication of Locke addressed to Holdsworth failed to find a publisher, but was included in her posthumous <span class="italic">Works</span>. In 1743 her <span class="italic">Remarks upon some writers in the controversy concerning the foundation of moral virtue and moral obligation</span> was printed, on the recommendation of the Revd Dr Thomas Sharp, archdeacon of Northumberland.<br>
<br>In 1747, despite her age and many years of poor health, Trotter wrote <span class="italic">Remarks upon the principles and reasonings of Dr. Rutherforth's Essay on the nature and obligations of virtue: in vindication of the contrary principles and reasonings, inforced in the writings of the late Dr. Samuel Clarke</span>, in support of Clarke's ethical principles. This was published by Mr Warburton, prefaced by a very glowing tribute to her powers of reasoning. She has been accused by some critics of not realizing that Clarke's ethical theory is inconsistent with that of Locke, yet there is considerable congruity in their approaches, as she recognized. Both men were concerned with describing a scheme of rational Christian morality; moreover, Locke did not dispute the concept of a fixed law of nature.<br>
<br>Catharine Cockburn died at Long Horsley shortly after her husband on 11 May 1749. Their graves are in the parish churchyard where she was buried on 13 May, together with their daughter Grissel, who had died on 1 November 1742. There were three surviving children, Sarah (Lady Keith), Catharine, and John.<br>
<br>In 1749 Warburton, among others, initiated a project to publish her writings, edited by Thomas Birch. The two-volume <span class="italic">Works</span> was eventually published by subscription in 1751. It includes all her important philosophical writing, with a few minor pieces, some poetry, many of her letters and one play, <span class="italic">Fatal Friendship</span>.<br>
<br>Interpretations of Trotter's work have been influenced by changes in the way women writers have been read over the last three hundred years. The early association with the stage quickly gave way to the image of a respectable learned lady, accelerated by the publication of her <span class="italic">Works</span> in 1751. Nineteenth-century editors substantially reinforced this emphasis on intellect and irreproachable moral standards, and foregrounded her role as wife and mother. It is only in the late twentieth century that the significance of her dramatic and philosophical work has been recognized, and her feminocentric stance as a dramatist and philosopher has been appreciated. Her own life was an argument for female rationality and responsibility, a demonstration that a woman could exercise her intellect in the male-dominated public sphere of philosophical debate.<br>
