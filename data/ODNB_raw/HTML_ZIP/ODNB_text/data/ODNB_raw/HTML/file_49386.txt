<span class="headword">Hart,  Heber Leonidas</span>  (1865&#150;1948), <span class="occ">judge and jurist</span>, was born on 31 March 1865 at 5 Binfield Road, Clapham, the youngest of several sons and one of eight children of Percy Matthew Hart, company registrar, of Wimbledon, and his wife, Sarah Ann Stillwell. He was named Heber after Bishop Reginald Heber (1783&#150;1826), author of the hymn &#145;From Greenland's Icy Mountains&#146;, and, at the suggestion of the clergyman officiating at his baptism, was given the second name Leonidas in preference to his parents' original choice of Leonard. Both his forenames provoked mirth in others but were &#145;a prolific source of life-long annoyance&#146; to Hart  (Hart, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 54). &#145;Heber Hart&#146; also suggested that he was of Jewish or German-Jewish origin, whereas, as he often felt obliged to make clear, he was &#145;absolutely English&#146;  (ibid., 58) and of pious Anglican parentage. Educated at private schools, he graduated at the University of London as a bachelor of laws with first-class honours in 1886. He was called to the bar of the Middle Temple in 1887 and joined the south-eastern circuit, taking the further degree of doctor of laws at London University in 1893. In 1894 he helped to establish the general council of the bar.<br>
<br>As a junior Hart had a large general practice and frequently appeared in headline catching cases. He was led by many of the most eminent counsel of the day, a galaxy which included Sir Edward Clarke; Sir Charles Russell (later lord chief justice), who impressed Hart with his &#145;overmastering natural eloquence&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 23); Sir Frank Lockwood; W. O. Danckwerts (later lord justice), &#145;easily the most masterful of leaders&#146;  (ibid., 29); the often &#145;irascible&#146;  (ibid., 20) Sir Robert Reid (later Lord Chancellor Loreburn); Henry Herbert Asquith, the future prime minister, whom he found &#145;neither genial nor attractive as a leader&#146;  (ibid., 146); F. E. Smith (later Lord Chancellor Birkenhead); and Sir Edward (later Lord) Carson, &#145;a model leader&#146;  (ibid., 27). Of all the orators whom he heard in a lifetime's experience, however, none in Hart's view compared for &#145;psychic power&#146; with Sir Henry Irving, whom at the age of twelve he saw perform in <span class="italic">The Bells</span>.<br>
<br>Specializing in commercial law, Hart wrote <span class="italic">The Law Relating to Auctions</span> (1895) and was elected first honorary member of the Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Institute; he followed this with <span class="italic">The Law of Banking</span> (1904), which ran to three further editions in 1906, 1914, and 1931, and became Gilbart lecturer in banking at London University in 1922. He took silk in 1913. In 1915 Lord Chancellor Haldane appointed him recorder of Ipswich, a position which he occupied until his retirement in 1936. He became a bencher of the Middle Temple in 1923, and was reader in 1931 and treasurer in 1937.<br>
<br>From 1920 the foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, appointed Hart as the British member of the mixed arbitral tribunals established under the post-war peace treaties with Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria. The task of the tribunals, which sat in London, was to resolve suits in contract and tort between British litigants and subjects of former enemy states in circumstances where the legal effects of war would otherwise have denied redress to either side. Each tribunal had unlimited jurisdiction to decide on fact and law, including complex questions of international law, and its decisions were final and not subject to appeal. Issues of fact ranged &#145;from the value of the world-wide concerns of great industrial companies to the items of a tailor's bill&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 39). Hart adjudicated together with a representative of the relevant state and a neutral president, but it was invariably he who took the lead in giving judgment. The workload was immense: some 10,000 cases fell to be decided by the Anglo-German tribunal alone. Hart sat from 1920 to 1931 until the work was complete, and he personally drafted most of the judgments, now in the Public Record Office. The strain of responsibility took its toll in insomnia and &#145;cardiac and nervous exhaustion&#146;  (ibid., 41).<br>
<br>Hart was a Liberal, an active partisan of the imperialist wing of the party. He stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Isle of Thanet in 1892, South Islington in 1895, and Windsor in 1910. In 1900 he founded the Imperial Liberal Council, whose aim was empire federation, and he criticized the <span class="roman">Statute of Westminster</span> (1931) for severing the constitutional ties between Britain and the dominions. From 1916 he was chairman of the Eighty Club, whose purpose was to further the Liberal cause in parliament, and from 1918 to 1923 he was chairman of what became known as the 1920 Club, founded to promote the cause of the Coalition Liberals under Lloyd George and to advocate their fusion with the Conservatives in a national centre party.<br>
<br>Hart's professional career did not match his promise. His appointment to the mixed arbitral tribunals cut short his progress as a leader and may have cost him the high judicial promotion for which his gifts seemed to mark him out. While many of the advocates who appeared before him at the tribunals were raised to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, his own services went unrewarded. Yet his contribution to the tribunals was distinguished, important, and original. &#145;I had a free hand in preparing what appeared to me the simplest and best rules of procedure&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Way to Justice</span>, 8), and in general the &#145;unique experience&#146;  (ibid.) gave scope to his extensive learning, his judicial flair, his creative ingenuity, and reforming zeal. He seized the opportunity to cut through &#145;the thraldom of archaic formalism&#146;  (ibid., 69), especially the rules of evidence, and to reduce the technicalities of English law to its underlying principles and to those of continental jurisprudence, which he saw as essentially akin. &#145;The entire laws of contracts and torts&#146;, he wrote, &#145;may be viewed as respectively expansions of two deep-seated imperatives of the ethics of civilised peoples, namely, &#147;Keep your promise&#148; and &#147;Injure no man&#148;&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Mixed arbitral Tribunals</span>, 13&#150;14).<br>
<br>The &#145;experiment&#146; of the tribunals stimulated Hart's appetite for law reform generally. Holding that &#145;our legal system is grievously at fault&#146; and &#145;may be the worst in western Europe&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Way to Justice</span>, 8, 26), he aired his views in a hard-hitting little book, <span class="italic">The Way to Justice: a Primer of Legal Reform</span> (1941), published when he was over seventy-five. In the spirit of Bentham, whom he quotes at length, he attacked the English legal system root and branch. He held that a bench of three judges should be the norm in every court of first instance, arguing for the abolition, both in civil and criminal cases, of trial by jury, or what he called &#145;a fortuitous assemblage of twelve people unacquainted with law or legal procedure, and not improbably including one or more persons of indifferent character or intelligence or unjudicial mind&#146;  (ibid., 55). He deplored the two-tier appellate system from Court of Appeal to House of Lords as a lottery&#151;arbitrary, unfair, and prohibitively costly for the loser&#151;calling for a single supreme court of appeal. He questioned the principle of the presumption of innocence and the rule against self-incrimination, arguing that both were outweighed by the need to protect the community from crime. He urged the abolition of most rules of evidence. Above all he condemned the very basis of the English legal system, reliance on precedent, and called for the law to be codified in order to &#145;obviate the enormous waste of time, labour and money now involved in the search for relevant authorities, and their examination, citation and discussion&#146;  (ibid., 35), after which &#145;every volume of law reports &hellip; might then be burnt&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 357). Such radical proposals &#145;received attention and also some criticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Feb 1948). Whatever their merits, some of the issues which they raise only began to receive serious consideration half a century after his death.<br>
<br>A founding member of the Romilly Society (1898), established to encourage penal and prison reform, Hart opposed both capital and corporal punishment, believing that sentencing should be &#145;neither retaliatory, vindictive nor retributive&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 325). As recorder of Ipswich he put his ideals into practice, to his own satisfaction but not without controversy. He chose to err on the side of mercy, imposing whenever possible a bind-over rather than a custodial sentence. In consequence of what he called &#145;my notorious leniency&#146;  (ibid., 34), defendants appearing before him regularly pleaded guilty, so that few cases came to trial. In the interests of impartial justice he held that recorders and judges should not have local allegiances in the area to which they are appointed and should not socialize with the lay magistrates with whom they sit on appeal. At the swearing-in of new justices he would remind them that a magistrate should &#145;comport himself towards the accused as he would feel it right to be treated himself if their relative positions were reversed&#146;  (ibid., 98). These admonitions still bear repeating.<br>
<br>Hart was a Christian philanthropist, who believed that &#145;underneath the shows of life there lies &hellip; the brotherhood of man&#146;  (Hart, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 326). He championed the Church Army and the nascent Salvation Army at a time when General Booth's ideas, publicized in <span class="italic">In Darkest England</span> (1890), met with &#145;opposition and ridicule&#146;  (ibid., 78). He admitted to &#145;my own excessive religiosity&#151;a morbidly developed sense of accountability to an unseen Power&#146;  (ibid., 176). There was something in Hart of a late Victorian individualist, combining personal eccentricities with strong convictions. As secretary of the London University defence committee from 1894 to 1900, he took part in the long controversy surrounding the university's reorganization. He played a &#145;prominent part&#146;  (ibid., 81) in opposing women's suffrage. He opposed boxing, fox-hunting, and the compulsory teaching of the classics; he advocated decimal coinage and the metrification of imperial weights and measures. He regarded reform of English spelling on phonetic lines as &#145;a truly urgent matter&#146;  (ibid., 356). He argued against pacifism&#151;during the First World War he served as a special constable, and became company commander of the Stepney battalion of the London volunteer regiment, receiving the post-war rank of honorary captain&#151;but he also wrote <span class="italic">The Bulwarks of Peace</span> (1918) in support of a League of Nations.<br>
<br>Hart was indifferent to sport, and particularly contemptuous of golf; his one physical recreation was sea voyages. He was cultivated and well read, becoming president of the Johnson Club in 1943. His acquaintances included the Victorian critic Theodore Watts-Dunton, the friend of Swinburne, whose cure from dipsomania was first effected at The Pines, 9 Putney Hill, London, where Hart himself lived continuously from the age of seventeen. He was a member of the Reform Club. A bachelor until the age of seventy-six, on 31 October 1941 he married Mabel Neal (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), a spinster more than twenty-five years his junior, the daughter of Thomas Neal, agriculturist. Hart died at his Putney home on 4 February 1948 of heart disease and arteriosclerosis, and was survived by his wife. He was cremated at Putney Vale on 7 February and his ashes were interred in the family vault at Putney Vale cemetery two days later.<br>
