<span class="headword">Kett,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1547&#150;1589), <span class="occ">physician and alleged heretic</span>, was born in Wymondham, Norfolk, the son of Thomas Kett (<i>c</i>.1500&#150;1553), gentleman, and his wife, Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1573), and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15485/', "Robert Kett (c.1492&#150;1549)")</script>. After the death of her husband, Agnes married Stephen Verdon, who by his will of 1572/3 contributed to the costs of his stepson's education. Having been admitted as a sizar to Clare College, Cambridge, in Michaelmas 1566, Francis graduated BA from Corpus Christi early in 1570. Proceeding MA in 1573, he was elected a fellow of the college in the same year, and at some point he was ordained. On 27 December 1576 he was one of the signatories of a letter thanking the university chancellor, Lord Burghley, for his arbitration in college disputes. He did not marry.<br>
<br>In 1580 Kett resigned his fellowship. He is unlikely to have influenced Christopher Marlowe, as used to be thought, because he left college soon after Marlowe's arrival there. He graduated MD in 1581, and in 1585 &#145;Francis Kett, doctor of phisick&#146; issued <span class="italic">The Glorious and Beautiful Garland of Mans Glorification</span>. As its dedication to Queen Elizabeth might suggest, this contained nothing doctrinally untoward. But in 1588 Edmund Scambler, bishop of Norwich, framed &#145;Articles of heretical pravity&#146; against Kett. Kett's views seem to have included both Arian and millenarian elements: according to the charges, he believed Jesus had suffered &#145;only as Jesus already, and shall suffer hereafter as Christ&#146; (only then becoming divine); that &#145;Christ is now in his human nature gathering a church in Erthe in Judea&#146;; and that &#145;this year of our Lord 1588 divers Jews shall be sent to divers countries to publish the new covenant&#146;  (Grosart, appx B1). A second official account reports that he also believed in soul-sleeping (psychopannychism). The Norwich minister William Burton reported his conviction that &#145;Christ is not God, but a good man as others be&#146;, but also noted that &#145;monstrous as he was in opinions, see how holy he would seem to be in his outward conversation. The sacred <span class="roman">Bible</span> almost never out of his hands, himself always in prayer, his tongue never ceased praising of God&#146;  (Burton, 125).<br>
<br>On 7 October 1588 Scambler wrote to Burghley, urging that Kett be speedily executed as a dangerous blasphemer. He was burnt in the ditch of Norwich Castle on 14 January 1589. Burton was a witness of his horrific death:<blockquote>when he went to the fire he was clothed in sackecloth, he went leaping and dauncing: being in the fire, above twenty times together clapping his hands, he cried nothing but blessed bee God &hellip; and so continued until the fire had consumed all his nether partes, and untill he was stifled with the smoke. (Burton, 125)</blockquote>
