<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jackson,  Gordon Cameron</span>  (1923&#150;1990), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Glasgow on 19 December 1923, the youngest of the five children of Thomas Jackson, a foreman letterpress printer, and his wife, Margaret Fletcher. He left the city's Hillhead high school at the age of fifteen to pursue a career as an engineering draughtsman with Rolls-Royce. However, like his contemporary Stanley Baxter, Jackson had been a child actor with the BBC in Scotland, and he was released by Rolls-Royce during the war to play the first of over sixty film roles in the propagandist <span class="italic">The Foreman Went to France</span> (1941). It was not long before Jackson forsook industry for acting: he worked in repertory, initially at the semi-professional Rutherglen Repertory Theatre, and then at the fully professional Glasgow Citizens' Theatre, which was founded in 1943 by James Bridie. Further appearances followed in theatres in Scotland and England, and he made his London d&eacute;but in the long-running production of Hugh Hastings's farce <span class="italic">Seagulls over Sorrento</span> in 1951. In that year he married the actress Rona Anderson (1926&#150;2013); they had played the romantic leads opposite each other in <span class="italic">Floodtide</span> (1949), one of the very few films about Scotland set on industrial Clydeside. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Gordon Jackson's career was steady, if not spectacular. His good looks, well modulated voice, and sensitivity to nuance of character ensured that he found work in a wide range of films including <span class="italic">Whisky Galore</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Tunes of Glory</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Mutiny on the Bounty</span> (1962), <span class="italic">The Ipcress File</span> (1965), <span class="italic">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">The Shooting Party</span> (1985). He performed regularly on the stage, most notably as Ishmael in Orson Welles's London production of <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> in 1955, as Banquo to Alec Guinness's Macbeth at the Royal Court in 1966, and Horatio to Nicol Williamson's Hamlet in Tony Richardson's 1969 production, which played on both sides of the Atlantic. For this last performance he gained the Clarence Derwent award for best supporting actor. Supporting actors are rarely as well known to the public as leading performers, yet the work they do can make or break productions. Jackson could be relied on to bring something distinctive to the roles he played, although until the end of his career he was apprehensive about every part he undertook, and had difficulty watching his own screen performances.<br>
<br>A much higher public profile than he had enjoyed thitherto came when, from 1970 until 1975, Jackson appeared in London Weekend Television's <span class="italic">Upstairs, Downstairs</span>, a series which explored the interaction of the parallel worlds of employers and servants in an Edwardian household. Jackson played the pivotal figure of the butler, Hudson, a dogged traditionalist who took his responsibilities very seriously indeed. For this portrayal he won the Royal Television Society's award for best actor in 1975, and an Emmy award in the United States in 1976. He followed Hudson by creating the much less attractive character of Cowley, the ruthless head of an anti-terrorist organization in <span class="italic">The Professionals</span> (1978&#150;83); it ran for fifty-seven episodes but was unworthy of Jackson's talent.<br>
<br>Jackson was one of a number of Scottish actors&#151;Andrew Cruickshank, Stanley Baxter, and Duncan Macrae were others&#151;who sought in their careers to strike a difficult balance. On the one hand, there were available to them the ethnic parts at which they were effortlessly adept, but which could so easily lead to typecasting; on the other, there was a wider range of non-Scottish roles, which could extend them as performers and in the esteem of audiences. Jackson rose well to this challenge, and subsequently enjoyed a career which was rewarding both artistically and financially. He was appointed OBE in 1979. He died, from cancer, in the Cromwell Hospital, Kensington, London, on 14 January 1990.<br>
