<span class="headword">Bell,  Valentine Graeme</span>  (1839&#150;1908), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, born in London on 27 June 1839, was the youngest son of William Bell, merchant, of Aldersgate Street, London, who was subsequently official assignee in bankruptcy. Educated at private schools and apprenticed in 1855 to Messrs Wren and Hopkinson, engineers, of Manchester, Bell became, in 1859, a pupil of James Brunlees. For Brunlees he was resident engineer in 1863&#150;5 on the Cleveland Railway in Yorkshire, and in 1866&#150;8 on the Mont Cenis Railway (on the Fell system), for which he directed the construction of special locomotives in Paris in 1869&#150;70. While in charge of the Mont Cenis line he rebuilt for the French government the <i>route imp&eacute;riale</i> between St Jean de Maurienne and Lanslebourg after its destruction by flood. In 1864 Bell married Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1868), daughter of Alexander Bell Filson MD; they had a daughter and a son, Archibald Graeme Bell (1868&#150;1948), who became director of public works in Trinidad. Bell was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 4 May 1869. In 1871 he set up in private practice in London, and in 1872&#150;5 he carried out waterworks at Cadiz for a company which failed and caused him financial losses. During the same period, with Sir George Barclay Bruce, he constructed a railway for the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Vieux Port de Marseille.<br>
<br>From 1880 Bell worked for the Colonial Office in Jamaica where he spent much of his professional life. In 1882 he married Emilie Georgina, daughter of Francis Robertson Lynch, clerk of the legislative council of Jamaica; they had two daughters and a son. Until 1883 Bell was engaged in reconstructing the government railway in Jamaica between Kingston and Spanish Town, which was in disrepair. He extended the line to Ewarton and Porus, and later to Montego Bay and Port Antonio. The governor, Sir Henry Norman, who recognized Bell's capacity and energy, appointed him in 1886 a member of the legislative council. Despite clear reservations within the Colonial Office concerning Bell's overall suitability, he was appointed director of public works in 1887 and held the office for nearly twenty-one years with admirable results. Under his direction the mileage of improved roads was extended from 800 to near 2000; 110 bridges and many modern public buildings were built, and works for water supply, drainage, and lighting were carried out. Energetic in his opposition, he was unable to prevent the transfer, in 1889, of the government railways to an American syndicate. This controversial move proved a failure, and the government resumed possession in 1900. He was made CMG in 1903 in recognition of his valuable public service. The Jamaican earthquake of 1907 seriously affected his health; Bell resigned his appointment in March 1908, and returned to England. He failed to recover from a serious operation and died at the Home Hospital, 16 Fitzroy Square, London, on 29 May 1908. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
