<span class="headword">Boston <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wood]</span>,  Lucy Maria</span>  (1892&#150;1990), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 10 December 1892 at 8 Scarisbrick Street, Southport, Lancashire; she was the fifth of the six children of James Wood (<i>d</i>. 1899), engineer and sometime mayor of Southport, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garrett. She was educated at local schools in Southport and Arnside, and latterly at a private Quaker boarding-school in Sussex. In 1914 she entered Somerville College, Oxford, but she left after one year to undertake volunteer nursing during the First World War. After early experience at St Thomas's Hospital in London and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, she worked at a military hospital at Houlgate, Normandy. On 21 September 1917 she married a distant cousin, (William) Harold Boston (1891&#150;1969), with whom she had one son, Peter, born in 1918. They lived at Norton Lodge, Norton, Cheshire, near Harold Boston's work as a director of the family tannery. The marriage failed in 1935 and thereafter Lucy spent several years working as an artist in Italy and Austria until the threat of war forced her to return to England. In 1937 she rented a flat in Cambridge, and shortly afterwards she bought the twelfth-century manor at Hemingford Grey, near Huntingdon, a unique and extraordinary house to which she devoted the rest of her life and work.<br>
<br>Lucy Boston found the manor in poor condition, with much of its original structure obscured by later Georgian additions, part of which had been destroyed by fire. Assisted by her son she spent several years in radical and painstaking restoration of the house, completing the work only after the outbreak of war. Over many years she remade the garden, which is distinguished for her topiary and collection of old roses. During the war she held regular concerts of classical music, played on her gramophone in the music room at the manor, to give respite and pleasure to RAF crews serving at nearby bases.<br>
<br>Boston was already in her sixties when her first book, <span class="italic">Yew Hall</span>, a novel for adults, was published in 1954; as in almost all her later writing the manor is its setting and centrepiece. Later in 1954 her first children's book, <span class="italic">The Children of Green Knowe</span>, appeared and it proved to be the first of six books in which the manor is characterized as Green Knowe; collectively they form one of the outstanding achievements in modern children's literature. Most of the stories are time fantasies, in which the house's history is evoked and past and present occupants make contact with each other. An exception to this historical preoccupation is <span class="italic">A Stranger at Green Knowe</span> (1961), widely regarded as her best book, which received the Library Association Carnegie medal for 1961. The tragic story of an escaped gorilla, based on Boston's indignation at the confinement of Guy the gorilla at London Zoo, it is an impassioned plea for freedom and respect for all wild, non-human creatures. The final book in the series, <span class="italic">The Stones of Green Knowe</span> (1976), written after a gap of twelve years, is notably pessimistic in its verdict on contemporary environmental damage. Having started late in life she continued to write and publish well into her eighties. Her other books include stories for very young children, such as <span class="italic">The Castle of Yew</span> (1965); two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Memory in a House</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">Perverse and Foolish</span> (1979); and a volume of poems, <span class="italic">Time is Undone</span> (1977).<br>
<br>Lucy Boston was a woman of immense energy and creativity, which she retained into extreme old age. She had very striking dark eyes and large, strong, artisan's hands, which she used not only for vigorous gardening (she was scornful of those who could not use a spade properly) but for a series of delicate and exquisite patchworks, now carefully preserved. Outspoken, independent, and fearless, with fiercely held values and mordant wit, she was also generous and kind, and enjoyed showing complete strangers around the house and garden she loved. She died at the manor, following a stroke, on 25 May 1990; she was buried at the church of St Margaret of Antioch, Hemingford Abbots, on 1 June.<br>
