<span class="headword">Vincent,  George</span>  (1796&#150;1832), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in the parish of St John Timberhill, Norwich, and baptized there on 27 June 1796, the son of James Vincent (1756&#150;1834), worsted weaver and shawl manufacturer, and his first wife, Mary Freeman (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1800). Vincent was educated at Norwich grammar school, where fellow pupils were John Berney Crome and James Stark. As a small boy he was &#145;always fond of drawing with charcoal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eastern Daily Press</span>, 20 Jan 1885), and about 1811 he was articled to the Norwich school artist John Crome (1768&#150;1821). In the same year he exhibited with the Norwich Society of Artists and continued to contribute fairly regularly until 1831. He also exhibited in London with the Royal Academy (1814&#150;23), the British Institution (1815&#150;31), the Society of Painters in Water Colours (1818&#150;29), and the Society of British Artists (1824&#150;30) as well as in Manchester and Glasgow. In 1816 he accompanied John Berney Crome and Benjamin Steel (who later married John Crome's daughter) to Paris. Vincent suffered from seasickness: &#145;They had a charming voyage over, Vincent belshing as loud as the steam packet, much to the discomfiture of some of the other passengers&#146;  (John Crome to James Stark, January 1816 [1817?], BL, Add. MS 43830, fol. 73). Soon after he probably painted <span class="italic">Rouen</span> (<i>c</i>.1817; Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery), the only continental subject known by Vincent. By 1818 he had moved to London and was living at 86 Newman Street, close to his Norwich friends James Stark and Joseph Clover (1779&#150;1853). About this time Clover painted Vincent's portrait, to which Vincent added the landscape background (<i>c</i>.1818; Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery). Referring to the portrait, a Norwich newspaper reported: &#145;Mr [Alfred] Stannard says of him that his face was disfigured by small-pox, and that he was a very plain man. As to the latter point, we hardly think the recollection is confirmed by the portrait&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eastern Daily Press</span>, 20 Jan 1885).<br>
<br>In 1819 Vincent toured Scotland, and in the following year exhibited with the British Institution the large canvas <span class="italic">View of Edinburgh from the Calton Hill, Evening</span> (Royal Bank of Scotland, London). Other Scottish subjects followed at intervals. His exhibited works won critical acclaim in Norwich and London, and in 1820 Sir John Leicester bought Vincent's painting <span class="italic">London, from the Surrey Side of Waterloo Bridge</span> for his collection at Tabley House, Cheshire. In 1822 Vincent married the daughter of a Dr Cugnoni, wrongly believing her to be a woman of property. They moved to a grand house in Kentish Town, London. By 1824 he appears to have been heavily in debt. This was presumably the cause of the &#145;folly&#146; that alienated him from his father and cut him off from his Norwich friends. Much of what is known of this period of his life is recorded in a series of letters written by Vincent from 26 Upper Thornhaugh Street, Bedford Square, London, to William Davey, a neighbour of Stark in Norwich, dated between 1824 and 1827  (BL, Add. MS 37030, fols. 1&#150;20). On 27 July 1824 he wrote bitterly: &#145;so much infamy has been unjustly levelled at me, by those whose duty it was to protect, that I am not astonished a man, like my father, should express himself with severity upon my past folly&#146;, adding &#145;from the sufferings my mind experiences my stay in this world will not be for a very long duration&#146;. Subsequent letters written during 1824 reveal Davey helping Vincent to sell paintings in Norwich at low prices. It was to no avail, because on 27 December 1824 Vincent wrote &#145;I am at this moment and have been for three weeks a prisoner in the Fleet &hellip; I can paint small pictures here but not any of size.&#146; He begged Davey that apart from Stark, no one should know of his whereabouts, particularly his father. During his imprisonment he was allowed out with a keeper to visit Stark in Norwich. He was discharged eventually in February 1827.<br>
<br>In the years surrounding these events, Vincent nevertheless produced some of his finest work, for example the large panoramic painting <span class="italic">A Distant View of Pevensey Bay, the Landing Place of King William the Conqueror</span> (1824; Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery), probably his most ambitious work, and <span class="italic">Trowse Meadows, Near Norwich</span> (1828; Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery). Vincent was the most accomplished of Crome's pupils, and in a short career produced a remarkable body of work. It shows a range of subjects and compositions with a breadth of handling and harmony of colour that exceeds that of his Norwich school contemporaries. Crome's influence is evident, and the crowded incident of Vincent's paintings of Great Yarmouth, for example <span class="italic">Dutch Fair on Yarmouth Beach</span> (1821; Great Yarmouth Museum) may be compared with similar compositions by Crome. Many of Vincent's landscapes are of Norfolk, including views on the River Yare, while others are the result of visits around Britain. He often signed his work with a conjoined GV and dated some in the 1820s. Few drawings by him exist, but of his etched work twelve etchings dated between 1820 and 1827 and one mezzotint (all British Museum) are known. His work is well represented in the collection at Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery. Following his release from the Fleet, he received some commissions, including one from James Wadmore for another large canvas, <span class="italic">Greenwich Hospital from the River</span> (1827). Although he continued to exhibit his work until 1831, nothing further is known of him until an obituary appeared in the Norwich press: &#145;Died lately at Bath, in his 36th year, Mr George Vincent, artist&#151;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, 14 April 1832).<br>
