<span class="headword">Thompson,  James</span>  (1817&#150;1877), <span class="occ">county historian and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 6 December 1817 at Leicester, the son of Thomas Thompson (1788&#150;1871), proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Leicester Chronicle</span> from 1813, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garton. He was educated first at W. H. Creaton's Classical and Commercial Academy in Billesdon and afterwards under the Revd Charles Berry, minister of the Great Meeting Unitarian Chapel, Leicester.<br>
<br>Thompson began as an editor on his father's newspaper in 1838, with a brief phase as editor of the radical Owenite paper the <span class="italic">Working Bee</span> in 1839 and as a sub-editor on O'Connor's <span class="italic">Northern Star</span> in 1841 to gain experience. He soon became an able leader writer, and for more than thirty years wrote nearly all the leading articles in the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>. In the major local dispute over town improvement in the 1840s he took the side of the &#145;economists&#146; in bitter opposition to William Biggs, urging new sewers before &#145;Brummagen Town Halls&#146;, especially after the 1846 typhus epidemic. His involvement in politics increased after the reformers became divided and the 1852 and 1857 general elections were fought between opposing reform candidates. The <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> supported the moderate faction, and its rival, the <span class="italic">Leicestershire Mercury</span>, the radicals. In 1852 Thompson organized the search from the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> offices for evidence of corruption for the unsuccessful election petition, and in 1857, with his father, signed the requisition for a rival Liberal candidate. After the Conservative candidate won a crushing by-election victory in 1861 Thompson campaigned effectively for Liberal reunion. He became joint proprietor of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> with his father in 1841 and sole proprietor in 1864, when he bought the <span class="italic">Mercury</span>, uniting the two rival Liberal papers. He began the <span class="italic">Leicester Daily Mercury</span> in connection with the 1874 general election. He was briefly elected to the town council in 1867, losing by one vote in 1870.<br>
<br>Thompson was the leading Victorian authority on the history of Leicester. For over thirty years he was responsible for the interpretation and preservation of the town's historic past: lecturing, writing, and recording archaeological discoveries, and opposing the destruction of the town's surviving medieval buildings, most notably the fourteenth-century Guildhall. In 1843 he began to print extracts from the works of local historians in the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> as &#145;Passages from the history of Leicester&#146;. The next year he published his <span class="italic">Handbook of Leicester</span> (3rd edn, 1860). He was soon led to examine the original records for himself, and his efforts with William Kelly in 1847 to rearrange the borough records, then poorly kept and in considerable disorder, undoubtedly helped to preserve one of the most detailed and complete municipal archives. His major study, <span class="italic">The History of Leicester from the Time of the Romans to the End of the Seventeenth Century</span> (1849), used this material extensively and revealed his interest in archaeology. The second volume, <span class="italic">The History of Leicester in the Eighteenth Century</span>, was published in 1871, and a popular account, his <span class="italic">Pocket History</span>, in 1876 (2nd edn, 1879). His <span class="italic">Essay on English Municipal History</span> (1867) examined the general history of the origin and development of boroughs. Among his projects was a history of Leicestershire, and shortly before his death he was preparing an account of the kingdom of Mercia. He was one of the founders of the Leicestershire Architectural and Archaeological Society (1855), a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and a member of the British Archaeological Association and the Society of Antiquaries. He was also one of the founders of the Leicester Mechanics' Institute and honorary curator of the town museum.<br>
<br>A man of singularly independent character in both religion and politics, Thompson was &#145;conservative in his tastes &hellip; [and] Liberal in his convictions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 6). He married, on 24 June 1847, Janet Bissett (<i>c</i>.1823&#150;1879), daughter of John McAlpin of Leicester. They had no children. He died at Dannett House, Fosse Road, Leicester, on 20 May 1877, and was buried four days later in Welford Road cemetery. His newspaper interests were purchased by Francis Hewitt in July 1877.<br>
