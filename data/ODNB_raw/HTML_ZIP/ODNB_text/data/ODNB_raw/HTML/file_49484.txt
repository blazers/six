<span class="headword">Henman,  Philip Sydney</span>  (1899&#150;1986), <span class="occ">transport entrepreneur</span>, was born on 21 December 1899 at Haddon Villas, Yalding, near Maidstone, Kent, the second son and third child of seven children of the Revd Sydney James Henman, Baptist minister at Yalding, and his wife, Ellen Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brine. Philip attended several schools, including Caterham School and later Shoreham grammar school. Rheumatic fever thwarted his early ambition to go to college and into the Christian ministry. At seventeen he joined a firm of Lloyd's insurance brokers, Alexander Howden &amp; Co. Conscripted in 1917, he joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps and was demobilized as a sergeant in 1921. Having studied some accounting, in 1922 he got a job as accountant to the General Lighterage Company, operating two barges from Hay's wharf. He became managing director in 1929, and began acquiring companies in wharfage, warehousing, road haulage, and other ancillary services, as well as barges and tugs. By 1939 he was chairman of the General Lighterage Company, and bought out Colonel Edgar Richard Hatfield, the firm's founder.<br>
<br>Henman survived the nationalization of the road haulage industry in 1947 by confining his business to short distance work. In 1950 he formed a public holding company, General Lighterage (Holdings) Ltd, to run sixteen subsidiaries, which together offered a &#145;package&#146; service, from ship to inland customer. Troubled labour relations in the docks and new methods of conveying commodities from ship to shore (such as pipelines and, later, containers) pointed to new directions, especially after the denationalization of long distance road services in 1953. He expanded his business by buying out smaller, often family, firms. Henman's success came from his rigorous cost-accounting, and from his style of management, which allowed his companies to retain their individual characters. When he retired in 1969 his group comprised over eighty operating subsidiaries in Britain, three in South Africa and Rhodesia, three in Australia, and seven in Europe. Turnover of the whole group stood at &pound;50 million, compared to under &pound;1 million in 1950. The group, renamed the Transport Development Group when it became a public company in 1957, operated over 4500 lorries, compared to 150 in 1950. Henman's other major business enterprise was the Square Grip Reinforcement Company, formed in 1934 by his elder brother, Frank Espinett Henman, to make twisted high tensile steel for the construction industry.<br>
<br>Henman married Jessie Mary <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nairn (1898&#150;1976), daughter of the manager of the London branch of the Scottish Provident Life Association, in 1931. They had one daughter, Mary Jessie. Among the many Christian causes Henman supported were the London Bible College (which John William Laing and he were instrumental in founding), Inter Varsity Fellowship (of which he became chairman), the British and Foreign Bible Society, and the Africa Inland Mission (whose home council he chaired). He was elected a patron of the Royal College of Surgeons and a benefactor of the Royal Society of Medicine in recognition of his large gifts to them. He became chairman, and later vice-president, of the council of the London chamber of commerce; vice-president of the Institute of Transport; member of the grand council of the CBI, and chairman of its transport committee; member of three city livery companies, the Paviors, Farmers, and Watermen and Lightermen; honorary doctor of the University of Surrey; high sheriff of Surrey (1971&#150;2), and deputy lieutenant of Surrey. For relaxation he took up farming in Surrey and in Scotland. He died on 8 November 1986, at Sundridge Hospital, Sundridge, Kent.<br>
