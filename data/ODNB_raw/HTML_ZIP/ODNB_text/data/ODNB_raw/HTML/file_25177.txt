<span class="headword">Seymour, Sir  Michael</span>, first baronet  (1768&#150;1834), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of the Revd John Seymour (<i>d</i>. 1795), one of a younger branch of the family of the dukes of Somerset which settled in Ireland in the time of Elizabeth I, was born at Glebe House, Pallas, co. Limerick, on 8 November 1768. His mother, Griselda, daughter and coheir of William Hobart of High Mount, co. Cork, was related to the family of the earls of Buckinghamshire. Seymour entered the navy in November 1780 on the sloop <i>Merlin</i> with Captain James Luttrell, whom he followed in March 1781 to the <i>Portland</i>, in April 1782 to the <i>Mediator</i>, and in April 1783 to the <i>Ganges</i>. When Luttrell retired in September 1783, Seymour was moved into the <i>Europa</i>, going to Jamaica with the flag of Vice-Admiral James Gambier. He was transferred to the <i>Antelope</i>, and afterwards to the <i>Janus</i> (Captain John Pakenham), and in September 1785 he returned to England in the <i>Ariel</i>, in bad health. In June 1786 he joined the <i>P&eacute;gase</i>, guardship at Portsmouth; and in June 1787 the <i>Magnificent</i>, with Captain George Cranfield Berkeley, an intimate friend of Luttrell. On Luttrell's death in December 1788, Berkeley brought Seymour's name before the duchess of Gloucester, but it was not until 28 October 1790 that Seymour was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Magnificent</i>. In October 1791 the <i>Magnificent</i> was paid off, and he spent the next eighteen months with his family in Ireland. In March 1793 he was appointed to the <i>Marlborough</i>, then commissioned by Berkeley, and was in her at the battle of 1 June 1794, when he was severely wounded. One of his arms had to be amputated above the elbow, and he was obliged to go on shore to recover. In February 1795 he joined Berkeley in the <i>Formidable</i>, moving in June to the <i>Commerce de Marseilles</i>, and in August to the <i>Prince</i>. On 20 August he was promoted commander. In June 1796 he was appointed to the <i>Fly</i>, from which in August he was moved to the sloop <i>Spitfire</i>, employed for the next four years in the channel and on the north coast of France. He took many prizes&#151;privateers and armed vessels, as well as small vessels trying to carry on the coasting trade. On 20 January 1789 he married Jane Hawker (<i>d</i>. 12 March 1852), daughter of Captain James Hawker; they had a large family, which included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25178/', "Michael Seymour (1802&#150;1887)")</script>.<br>
<br>On 11 August 1800 Seymour was promoted captain. During the following years he was appointed to the temporary command of many different ships without being able to get a ship of his own. It was not until June 1806 that he was appointed to the frigate <i>Amethyst</i> (36 guns), attached to the Channel Fleet but principally cruising independently off the coast of France, with which, during his long service in the <i>Spitfire</i>, he had become well acquainted. On the evening of 10 November 1808, off the &Icirc;le de Groix, he fell in with the French frigate <i>Th&eacute;tis</i> which had sailed that afternoon from Lorient with a detachment of troops on board for Martinique. Shortly after 9 p.m. he brought her to action, and for three hours there occurred one of the most stubborn and well-contested fights of the war. A few minutes after midnight, being reduced to a wreck and having 236 killed or wounded out of 436 on board, the <i>Th&eacute;tis</i> surrendered. The <i>Amethyst</i> lost 70 killed or wounded out of 261; her rigging was cut to pieces, her mizzen-mast fallen, and her mainmast and foremasts were badly damaged. As soon as the two ships were made safe, the <i>Amethyst</i> returned to Plymouth, accompanied by her prize in tow of the <i>Shannon</i>. Seymour was presented with the gold medal; by the Patriotic Fund with &pound;100 for a sword or a piece of plate; and by the corporations of Limerick and Cork with the freedom of the cities. The first lieutenant of the <i>Amethyst</i> and one of the midshipmen nominated by Seymour were promoted, and other officers were appointed to higher rates.<br>
<br>On 8 February 1809 Seymour, still in the <i>Amethyst</i>, sailed again, and early on 6 April, off the &Icirc;le d'Ouessant, fell in with, engaged, and captured the French frigate <i>Ni&eacute;men</i>, which lost 120 men killed and wounded. On his return to England, Seymour was created a baronet on 31 May 1809. During the summer the <i>Amethyst</i> was attached to the fleet on the coast of the Netherlands, part of the time with the flag of Sir Richard John Strachan on board; and in October Seymour was appointed to the <i>Ni&eacute;men</i>, the officers and crew of the <i>Amethyst</i> being at the same time turned over to her. In her he continued on similar service until May 1812, when he was appointed to the <i>Hannibal</i> (74 guns); he commanded her in the channel for the next two years, capturing the French frigate <i>Sultane</i> on 26 March 1814.<br>
<br>In September the <i>Hannibal</i> was paid off, and Seymour settled down for the next few years near Kingsbridge in Devon. On 3 January 1815 he was nominated a KCB, and in December of that year the pension for the loss of his arm was increased to &pound;300 a year. In September 1818 he was appointed to the <i>Northumberland</i>, guardship at Sheerness; and in August 1819 to the <i>Prince Regent</i>, one of the royal yachts, from which, in 1825, he was moved to the <i>Royal George</i>, the king's own yacht. During this time he lived principally on shore at Blendworth House, which he had bought, close to Portsmouth. While there he read a great deal and gardened.<br>
<br>In January 1829 Seymour accepted the appointment of commissioner at Portsmouth, a form of semi-active retirement for noted but poor flag officers, which was by custom tenable for life. In 1832 the Admiralty abolished the Navy Board and, with it, the commissionerships at the dockyards. Seymour was offered the choice of holding his office for two more years and then retiring, or of returning to the active list, taking his flag, and going out to South America as commander-in-chief. He chose the latter, his commission as rear-admiral being dated 27 June 1832. With his flag in the <i>Spartiate</i> he sailed in February 1833 for Rio de Janiero, where the duties of the station compelled him to remain. In April 1834 he had a severe attack of &#145;low fever&#146;, and on his partial recovery he was landed. On shore, however, he made no satisfactory progress, and he died on 9 July 1834. He was buried in the English cemetery at Rio de Janiero, and a monument to his memory was erected there.<br>
<br>Seymour was a brave and active captain. Although he was not particularly well-connected, especially within the navy, his career brought him to the attention of the prince regent, who supported him after 1815. His relatively slow promotion and inability to find a ship as a captain between 1800 and 1806 were especially revealing. His final command was almost certainly taken to further the career of his son Michael.<br>
