<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burgh,  Ulick John  de</span>, first marquess of Clanricarde  (1802&#150;1874), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 20 December 1802 in Belmont, Hampshire, the only son and second child in the family of one son and two daughters of John Thomas de Burgh (1744&#150;1808), thirteenth earl of Clanricarde, army officer, and his wife Elizabeth (1763/4&#150;1854), daughter of Sir Thomas Burke, bt, of Marble Hill, co. Galway. The family had been settled in the west of Ireland from the early thirteenth century and on the death of his father in 1808 Ulick John de Burgh inherited, in addition to the earldom, 56,000 acres in co. Galway. In 1825 he married Harriet (1804&#150;1876), the gifted daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4556/', "George Canning (1770&#150;1827)")</script>, foreign secretary and later prime minister. They had two sons and five daughters. Macaulay wrote of her: &#145;She is very beautiful, and very like her father &hellip; she showed much cleverness and information, but, I thought, a little more of political animosity than is quite becoming in a pretty woman&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 3.238). After his marriage it was rumoured he had been involved in a gambling scandal, but his father-in-law stood by him and it was largely through him that Burgh was created a marquess in the peerage of Ireland in 1825 and Baron Somerhill in the peerage of the United Kingdom in 1826.<br>
<br>Clanricarde was appointed under-secretary of state for foreign affairs in 1826, a post he resigned after Canning's death in 1827. A few years later he was accused of having speculated on the Paris bourse, using official information. This he vehemently denied. A Canningite, he became a whig. In 1830 he was appointed captain of the yeomen of the guard and in 1831 knight of St Patrick. In 1834 he resigned his office because he felt slighted by the ministry (another Irish peer, the second Marquess Conyngham, having been appointed postmaster-general). In 1838 he was appointed ambassador to St Petersburg. He served there until 1841, and, moving easily in Russian society, was a shrewd commentator on Russian social conditions, personalities, and policy.<br>
<br>From 1846 until 1852 Clanricarde was in Lord John Russell's cabinet as postmaster-general. He was an administrative reformer, working cordially with Rowland Hill, who was much pleased with &#145;his businesslike, straight-forward manner&#146; and his courageous willingness to follow &#145;a novel and decided course of action&#146;. As a member of the cabinet which had to cope with the Irish famine, Clanricarde pressed hard for remedial measures, pointing out that from time to time &#145;an adherence to sound principle will cause an immediate sacrifice&#146;.<br>
<br>Clanricarde was not included in Aberdeen's coalition cabinet in 1852. He took a strongly anti-Russian line in 1854, encouraging the government to war. In 1855 his name was opprobriously mentioned in the Irish case of <i>Handcock v. Delacour</i>, which attracted much attention. It was alleged that John Delacour (<i>b</i>. 1841), a minor, was Clanricarde's illegitimate son from a liaison with Catherine Josephine Handcock, the wife of William Henry Handcock, an Irish landowner, and that Clanricarde had schemed that Handcock's property should pass to Delacour. The case ended in a compromise. Clanricarde published long statements in which he denied the allegations and explained that he had become involved with the Handcock family's legal arrangements purely out of a good-natured wish to be of assistance. Nevertheless when Palmerston at the close of 1857 invited Clanricarde to join his cabinet, a large section of public opinion professed to be shocked. <span class="italic">Punch</span> published two harsh cartoons and, when at the end of February 1858 the government was defeated, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, with possibly a touch of exaggeration, declared that Clanricarde had been able by his &#145;mere presence&#146; in the cabinet to destroy an exceptionally strong administration. He was the model for Trollope's Lord Brittleback.<br>
<br>For about forty years Clanricarde spoke frequently in the House of Lords on a wide range of subjects. Although it was said that his main contribution to debate was his sonorous &#145;hear, hear&#146;, his speeches, reflecting the outlook of a liberal-minded whig, were usually sensible and to the point. He seems to have possessed an ingenuous self-assurance which could get him into difficulties and arouse antagonism. In 1847 he was described as &#145;a tall, thin, aristocratic man, bald and bland, wearing &hellip; tight pantaloons, striped silk socks, and pumps&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). He died at his home, 17 Stratton Street, Piccadilly, London, on 10 April 1874 and was succeeded in the marquessate by his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32179/', "Hubert George de Burgh Canning")</script>. Despite the allegations made in the court proceedings of 1855, John Delacour was unlikely to have been the son of Clanricarde, who was in St Petersburg during the relevant period; Clanricarde did, however, have &#145;various mistresses&#146; and &#145;an apparently unlimited number of illegitimate children&#146;, as his heir complained  (second marquess of Clanricarde to Captain McDonagh, 10 Nov 1876, Roche, 18).<br>
<br>Clanricarde's first son, <a name="cosubject_55429"></a><span class="headword">Ulick Canning  de Burgh</span>, Lord Dunkellin  (1827&#150;1867), <span class="occ">politician</span>, known throughout his life as Lord Dunkellin (from a subsidiary title of his father's), was born at St James's Square, London, on 12 July 1827. Educated at Eton College, he became an ensign in the Coldstream Guards in 1846, and held the rank of lieutenant-colonel from 1854 to 1860. He fought in the Crimea (being captured at Sevastopol), was military secretary to his uncle Lord Canning in India in 1856, and served on the staff of Sir James Outram during the Persian expedition of 1856&#150;7. He was Liberal MP for Galway City, 1857&#150;65, and for co. Galway, 1865&#150;7. An Adullamite, he moved the famous amendment on the rating franchise during the committee stage of the <span class="roman">Parliamentary Reform Bill</span>, on 18 June 1866, which caused the resignation of Earl Russell's government later that month. Dunkellin, who was unmarried, suffered from prolonged ill health, and died at his father's home, 17 Stratton Street, London, on 16 August 1867. His grieving father erected a bronze statue of him in Galway, in 1874, but it was removed and destroyed, as a symbol of landlord tyranny, in 1922. His elder sister, Emily Charlotte de Burgh, later Lady Cork (1828&#150;1912), long remembered her brother's role in bringing down Russell's administration  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Oct 1912, 9).<br>
