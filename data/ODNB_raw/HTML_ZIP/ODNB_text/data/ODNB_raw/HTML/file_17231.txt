<span class="headword">Luxford,  George</span>  (1807&#150;1854), <span class="occ">botanist and printer</span>, was born on 7 April 1807 at Sutton in Surrey, from where the family subsequently moved to nearby Reigate. At the age of eleven he was apprenticed to a printer and in the sixteen years he remained with him made up for his truncated schooling by extensive reading and acquiring a knowledge of French, Latin, and Greek. He also developed a fondness for field botany and entomology, and spent his leisure hours in combing the district in search of plants. <span class="italic">A Flora of the Neighbourhood of Reigate</span> (1838), which he printed himself, was the eventual product of that.<br>
<br>After three years in Birmingham (1834&#150;7), Luxford returned south and set up on his own as a printer in London. Within a few months Longmans had switched to him the contract for printing Loudon's <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span>, perhaps at the instance of his fellow Surrey naturalist, Edward Newman (1801&#150;1876), who was at that point one of its chief contributors. Newman had become convinced that separate magazines catering for the respective subcommunities of natural history were a commercial proposition and was then looking for a vehicle through which to prove that belief. Luxford's business seemed ideal, and, after first being taken on as a partner, Newman was allowed to buy it outright in 1841. That June a botanical monthly, <span class="italic">The Phytologist</span>, made its appearance from this stable, with Luxford named as editor. That this was no mere trade convenience was quickly shown by the frequent learned contributions made by the editor to the earlier numbers. Luxford's appointment in 1846 as lecturer in botany at St Thomas's Hospital and his election in 1848 to the council of the Botanical Society of London (of which <span class="italic">The Phytologist</span> had effectively become the publishing outlet) came as added credentials.<br>
<br>Luxford remained editor of <span class="italic">The Phytologist</span> until 1851, but, even after his retirement from business, continued to act as compositor and reader. <span class="italic">The Phytologist</span> was, however, never a financial success and was kept in print for as long as thirteen years only by cross-subsidies from Newman's more profitable ventures. On Luxford's death, on 12 June 1854 at 10 Victoria Place, Hill Street, Walworth, publication of the journal ceased; this seems to confirm the supposition that Newman had kept it going only out of loyalty to his former partner, although letters provide evidence that Newman subsequently sought in vain to recruit other leading botanists to take Luxford's place. Luxford had proved himself irreplaceable.<br>
