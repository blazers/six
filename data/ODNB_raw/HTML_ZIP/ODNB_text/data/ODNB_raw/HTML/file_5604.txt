<span class="headword">Clement <span class="st"> [Clements; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Giggs]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1508&#150;1570), <span class="occ">adopted daughter of Sir Thomas More</span>, is of obscure parentage. She was described by the biographer of her daughter Margaret as having been &#145;a gentleman's daughter of Norfolk&#146;  (Durrant, 183); a family named Giggs lived in a building adjoining Bucklersbury in London, at first the home of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19191/', "Thomas More")</script> and thereafter of the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5603/', "John Clement (d. 1572)")</script> after his marriage to Margaret in 1526. In the portrait of the More family by Holbein, Margaret Giggs is described as &#145;cognata&#146;, a relative, so it seems to be in that capacity that she was adopted to keep More's eldest daughter, also a Margaret, company. More spotted her intelligence and piety, and she was taught in his &#145;school&#146; along with his other daughters and close friends. Her teacher in Greek, for a time, was her future husband. She had a reputation for having a sense of humour, and Vives praised her Greek.<br>
<br>Margaret Giggs acted as More's almoner when he was lord chancellor and looked after his objects of personal piety, including his hair shirt. When More was in the Tower, Margaret lent him her &#145;algorism stone&#146;, a slate for calculations or, in his case, for jotting down thoughts best kept from prying eyes. Margaret was one of the few eyewitnesses to his execution and the only member of his household present. As promised, the king permitted her to recover the body for burial; she was also one of those to whom the emperor, Charles V, conveyed condolences on More's death.<br>
<br>By the time that Margaret Giggs married John Clement he was rapidly making his reputation as a doctor. The matrimonial home held a portrait of Thomas More, and it was full of books in Greek and Latin as well as glasses and &#145;earthern painted pots&#146; with medicines inside. Margaret's first child was born in 1527 and her last (the eleventh) in 1540. Amid the rigours of childbirth Margaret found time, in May 1537, to minister to the Carthusians who were imprisoned in Newgate without trial and chained to a post without access to food or sanitation. Margaret bribed the gaoler and for a time kept them fed and clean until their very survival alerted the king to the succour they were receiving.<br>
<br>The Clements had to flee on the accession of Edward VI, first to Bruges and Louvain but ultimately to Mechelen. In the reign of Mary they made a brief return to England both to reclaim their confiscated property (carefully listed by Margaret) and to attempt to regain possession of their houses in London and Hornchurch. The reign of Elizabeth saw them in exile again and Margaret died in Mechelen on 6 July 1570. She was buried in the cathedral of St Rumbald. Two of her daughters entered the religious life, while her eldest married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23151/', "William Rastell")</script>. Her gifts were directed to serving her family, the religious, and the poor. A drawing of her by Holbein, erroneously inscribed Mother Iak by a later hand, suggests a thoughtful and rather serious woman.<br>
