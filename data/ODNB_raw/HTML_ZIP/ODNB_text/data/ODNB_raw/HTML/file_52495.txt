<span class="headword">Smith,  Eliza</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1732?), <span class="occ">writer on cookery</span>, is known only through her book, <span class="italic">The Compleat Housewife, or, Accomplished Gentlewoman's Companion</span>. This was first published in 1727, four or five years before her death. In it she was identified only as &#145;E&#151; S&#151;&#146;, though in later editions her full name was given. Her work proved popular, running to more than a dozen editions, only passing out of favour towards the end of the century. In 1742 <span class="italic">The Compleat Housewife</span> became the first cookery book to be published in America, preceding the first book of specifically American cookery by over fifty years.<br>
<br>Virtually nothing more is known for certain about Eliza Smith's life. In the preface to her book, she claimed &#145;that for the Space of Thirty years and upwards &hellip; I have been constantly employed in fashionable and noble Families, in which the Provisions ordered according to the following Directions, have had the general Approbation of such as have been at many noble entertainments&#146;. Shorn of its verbiage, she was a housekeeper. Probably, unlike others of her calling more fortunate than herself, she did not leave to take up a career as a confectioner or to run a school of cookery. There are slight hints in her book of an association with the Netherlands, and Lord Montagu has suggested that she may have worked at Beaulieu  (Maclean, 135).<br>
<br>Contemporary female cookery writers can be divided into two groups&#151;those who published or sold their book themselves, and those who used the services of a printer to act for them. Most of the first group were either of near gentle birth or had escaped from the toils of earning their livelihood through housekeeping; Eliza Smith belonged to the second group, composed largely of housekeepers. Her recipes, she claimed in the preface, were essentially English, and &#145;proper for a frugal, and also for a sumptuous Table&#146;, though most would best fit the former category. Nevertheless there were some interesting innovations. She was among the first to use potatoes for savoury dishes, and she even offered one recipe using tea. This was for a caudle or hot drink made with &#145;strong green tea&#146;, white wine, grated nutmeg, and sugar, thickened with eggs like a custard  (Smith, <span class="italic">The Compleat Housewife</span>, 16th edn, 193). Her book ends with a substantial section of medicinal recipes that she called &#145;family receipts&#146;. Some are identified with members of the gentry, many more with members of the medical profession. Her knowledge of the technicalities of medicine went beyond what might be expected in a book of &#145;family receipts&#146;.<br>
<br>Little is known of Eliza Smith, as is true of many female writers of cookery books in the eighteenth century, but her book is an outstanding example of the genre, rivalling Hannah Glasse and Elizabeth Raffald in content and contemporary popularity. She died, according to the fifth edition of <span class="italic">The Compleat Housewife</span> (1733), probably in 1732.<br>
