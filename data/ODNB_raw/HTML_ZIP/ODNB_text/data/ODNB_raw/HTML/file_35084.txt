</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moody,  Harold Arundel</span>  (1882&#150;1947), <span class="occ">physician and founder of the League of Coloured Peoples</span>, was born on 8 October 1882 at 8 Rum Lane, in Kingston, Jamaica, the eldest of six children of Charles Ernest Moody (1861&#150;1920) and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Christina Emmeline Ellis (<i>d</i>. 1951), who kept a drug store. Moody, a diligent student at Wolmer's Free School, went on to study medicine at King's College, London, in 1904.<br>
<br>Moody qualified MB, BS in 1912 and gained an MD in 1919. Although well qualified, he was refused a post at King's College Hospital because of his colour; eventually he was employed as medical superintendent of the Marylebone Medical Mission in London. On 10 May 1913 Moody married Olive Mabel Tranter (1889&#150;1965), a white nurse, who worked closely with him in a long and happy marriage which produced two girls and four boys. That same year he opened a practice in Peckham, London, eventually moving to 164 Queen's Road, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. Moody revisited Jamaica on only three occasions, in 1912, 1919, and finally in 1946&#150;7.<br>
<br>As a teenager Harold Moody became a Christian and his faith was the mainspring of his life and activities. Until the late 1920s Moody concentrated on his family, medical work, and various Christian activities mainly within the Congregational Union and as chairman of the Colonial Missionary Society. Racial prejudice was widespread and overt, and Moody sought to counter this by using his professional influence and preaching opportunities, although with few results. In 1931 he founded the League of Coloured Peoples (LCP), a multiracial organization, to press for black civil rights. Moody regarded the LCP as a Christian body pursuing a Christian purpose, and he pressed these claims in his preaching and as president of the Christian Endeavour Union (1936) and chairman of the London Missionary Society (1943). In its early years the league engaged mainly in a range of social and welfare roles, while Moody sought the support of influential people, who were invited to address its meetings and conferences.<br>
<br>The Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 politicized the league and gave it a sharper pan-African edge. The league lobbied on a variety of national and international issues: the treatment of black British seamen as aliens, land and labour questions in British colonial Africa, the labour and political unrest in the Caribbean in the late 1930s, and the &#145;colour bar&#146; in Britain and the colonies. In these protests the LCP was often allied to other black groups, including those led by radicals, although relations were never easy: there was tension between Moody and African students in the mid-1930s over who should control a London hostel for west African students, for example.<br>
<br>The wartime influx of black workers and soldiers into Britain led to increased racial animosity and helped give the LCP greater purpose and influence. Moody became a frequent visitor to government departments. Some officials regarded him as pompous and interfering but invariably he was listened to with respect. In 1943 he joined advisory bodies on the training of nurses in the colonies and on the welfare of colonial people in Britain. At the 1944 London conference of the LCP a &#145;charter for coloured peoples&#146; demanded &#145;full self-government&#146; for colonial peoples &#145;at the earliest possible opportunity&#146; and that racial discrimination in Britain be made illegal. The charter foreshadowed some of the demands made at the Pan-African Congress in Manchester in 1945, which Moody helped to prepare but did not attend.<br>
<br>Moody wrote several pamphlets on race relations, while a league committee report of 1944 advocated radical changes in school curricula in an attempt to counter racial prejudice. In the winter of 1946&#150;7 Moody made an extended speaking and preaching tour of the West Indies in order to raise money for a colonial culture centre in London. It was a tiring and disappointing journey. Moody returned ill to his London home and died there of acute influenza on 24 April 1947; he was cremated at the South London crematorium.<br>
<br>Moody was a tall, bespectacled, and imposing figure with a dominating personality. A bronze bust, executed by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73203/', "Ronald Clive Moody")</script> in 1953, is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The league continued until the early 1950s, faltered, and then closed; it had been Moody's personal creation, largely sustained and directed by his enthusiasm, energy, and income.<br>
