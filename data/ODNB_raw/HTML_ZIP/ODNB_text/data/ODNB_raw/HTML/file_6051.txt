<span class="headword">Conant,  John</span>  (1608&#150;1694), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 18 October 1608 at Yettington, Bicton, in south-east Devon, the eldest son of Robert Conant and his wife, Elizabeth Morris; the family had lived for several generations in Devon. His uncle of the same name, rector of Limington in Somerset, recognized an aptitude for learning in the young Conant and placed him first in the free school at Ilchester, Somerset, and then under the instruction of the schoolmaster Thomas Branker. His uncle gave him additional instruction. In 1627 his uncle took him to Oxford, where he was enrolled on 18 February as a commoner of Exeter College, of which the elder John Conant had been a fellow between 1611 and 1620. At Exeter the younger Conant's tutor was Lawrence Bodley, nephew of the benefactor of the Bodleian Library. Conant quickly gained a mastery of Greek, disputing publicly in that language, and also excelled in Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic. His precocity was recognized by John Prideaux, the anti-Arminian rector of Exeter, who commented that he found nothing difficult. John Conant graduated BA on 26 May 1631, and proceeded MA on 12 January 1634; on 30 June 1632 he was chosen a probationer of Exeter College, and on 3 July 1633 made a fellow. He was ordained deacon and tutored pupils until 1642, when the disruption of Oxford by civil war caused him to depart, leaving behind valuable books which he never regained.<br>
<br>Conant planned to join his uncle at Limington, but by the time he arrived his uncle, a supporter of the parliamentary cause, had gone to London. There his uncle preached to the House of Commons on 26 July 1643, calling on it to reform the church, and was a member of the Westminster assembly (not the nephew, as some sources assert). Conant remained for a while at Limington, preaching and carrying out parish duties, until so menaced by royalist troops that he joined his uncle in London and began to assist him in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, but he soon took up residence at Harefield, Middlesex, in the family of Lord and Lady Chandos, whom he served as chaplain. Lady Chandos, the daughter of Henry Montagu, earl of Manchester, was in particular his patron, awarding him an annual stipend of &pound;80, much of which he used to relieve the needy of the parish, and provide them with bibles and schooling. Meanwhile, for several years he gave a weekday lecture at nearby Uxbridge. On 20 December 1645 he was offered the rectory of Whimple, Devon, by the committee for plundered ministers, but refused it. When in 1647 subscription to the solemn league and covenant was required of college fellows, Conant refused to take it, resigning his fellowship at Exeter by a letter from Harefield dated 27 September 1647.<br>
<br>When the rector of Exeter died in 1649 a majority of the fellows wanted Conant's uncle for the position, but the elder Conant wished to remain at the parish of St Thomas, Salisbury, and urged his nephew for the post; the nephew was duly elected on 7 June 1649, and admitted to the office on 29 June 1649. Conant was soon confronted with the question of affirming his loyalty to the parliamentary government by taking the engagement, which was made mandatory for members of colleges in October 1649. Conant took it, but declared to the commissioners that in doing so he did not necessarily approve of all that the government had done, and that he was not abridging his liberty to declare allegiance to any other future power that God might put over him.<br>
<br>Conant was an ideal choice for rector, and took up his duties with alacrity. He found the college deeply in debt and deficient in discipline, and remedied both, enforcing strict observance of the college statutes. He also catechized the college servants and attended the academic exercises and daily prayers of the college. In weekly instruction to the undergraduates he refuted Socinianism and Roman Catholicism and drew on such standard works of reformed scholasticism as Johannes Wollebius's <span class="italic">Compendium theologiae Christianae</span> and Johannes Piscator's <span class="italic">Aphorismi doctrinae Christianae</span>. He led a study of biblical prophecy for more advanced students, using Thomas Parker's <span class="italic">The Visions and Prophecies of Daniel Expounded</span> (1646), a book by a New England minister which asserted that the pope was the antichrist. Conant's leadership at Exeter attracted large numbers of students, including some from abroad. He was awarded the DD on 31 May 1654.<br>
<br>While rector of Exeter, John Conant preached regularly at three nearby parishes: at All Saints' he preached every Friday morning at seven o'clock for more than ten years, developing a complete body of divinity for his auditors; at St Michael's he preached almost every Sunday for several years; and at St Mary Magdalen's he preached every other Sunday for half of each year. He also preached frequently as vicar of Kidlington, near Oxford, which was annexed to the rectory of Exeter. Conant declined the rectory of Ewelme in Oxfordshire, which was also attached to the college. In August 1651 he married Elizabeth Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1707), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23408/', "Edward Reynolds (1599&#150;1676)")</script>, then rector of Braunston, Northamptonshire, and a leader of those more moderate puritans usually designated presbyterians; the couple had six sons and six daughters. In October 1652 Conant was presbyterially ordained to the ministry at Salisbury, where his uncle, who may have participated in the ceremony, was then living.<br>
<br>In September 1654 Conant was appointed regius professor of divinity at Oxford. To fulfil the duties of that office he lectured twice a week, basing his lectures on the biblical annotations of Hugo Grotius, whose philological scholarship was much admired even by those who rejected his Arminianism. As compensation for the sequestered income of his divinity chair, in 1657 Conant was awarded by Oliver Cromwell the income from the rectory of Abergele, Denbighshire, much of which, however, he returned to its resident vicar and to the poor of the parish. Conant never published any of his theological lectures, and later destroyed his notes for them. But there are indications of his theological position: for example, a letter from John Warner, a critic of Baxter's <span class="italic">Aphorisms of Justification</span>, claimed that Conant praised certain theological distinctions Warner had used in refuting Baxter. Orthodox Calvinists had been disturbed by Baxter's book.<br>
<br>On 9 October 1657, shortly after Richard Cromwell succeeded his father as chancellor of Oxford University, he named John Conant as vice-chancellor. Before then Jesus College bursars' accounts show him handling payments to the university by 1654. As vice-chancellor Conant restored many traditional usages, such as the wearing of caps and hoods, which had been considered popish by his predecessor John Owen. He also opposed the grant of a university charter to Durham College, going to London in 1659 with Seth Ward and John Wilkins to help thwart it. And just as he had enforced discipline in Exeter College, he now sought to do so in the whole university. He was also instrumental in procuring in 1659 the enormous library of John Selden for the Bodleian.<br>
<br>Conant welcomed the Restoration, silencing in January 1660 a Baptist preacher at Balliol who denounced the coming changes, and, with a deputation of university notables to the court, on 15 June 1660 presented the king with a book of congratulatory verses composed for the occasion by members of the university. He also made a speech in Latin before the king. But he lost his professorship, as the deprived Robert Sanderson was reinstated. In August 1660 he was removed from the vice-chancellorship. In the summer of 1662 the new vice-chancellor, the Laudian Richard Baylie, questioned him for preaching against Arminianism and for denying that original sin was taken away by baptism. His lecture at All Saints' was suppressed at about the same time.<br>
<br>Conant was one of the twelve presbyterian leaders who sought compromise with the bishops at the Savoy conference in 1661, but he was dissatisfied with the results of the conference, and could not accept the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, even though his father-in-law, who was then appointed Bishop of Norwich, did. Conant's son and biographer of the same name<a href="#cosubject_6052"> [<i>see below</i>]</a> thought that his father would have been offered the bishopric of Exeter if he had conformed. On 2 September 1662 Conant was deprived of his last Oxford office, rector of Exeter, for not subscribing to the liturgy of the Church of England. One year later (30 September 1663) he was summoned along with others before the chancellor, the earl of Clarendon, and accused of holding an illegal conventicle in his house. Conant eventually removed to Northampton, where in 1666 he took the &#145;Oxford oath&#146;, rejecting armed opposition to the king and promising not to press for changes in church or civil government. There he apparently did not preach illegally, but attended the services of the established church. After reflecting on the issue of conformity, and comparing the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> with ancient liturgies, Conant conformed, and was ordained priest by his father-in-law on 20 September 1670. Conformists praised him for persuading others to conformity (both John Tillotson and George Bull spoke well of him), but he was still trusted by such moderate dissenters as Richard Baxter, who thought that Conant and other peaceable persons on both sides could have easily settled the matters separating the church and dissent. Conant was falsely rumoured to be the author of an eirenic tract, <span class="italic">Persuasive to Peace and Unity</span> (1672).<br>
<br>With conformity and reordination preferment was open to Conant, and he became the vicar of All Saints', Northampton, on 15 February 1671. He remained there, at an annual income of &pound;100, even though other positions were offered him. Various persons, including the secretary of state, Joseph Williamson, and the mathematician John Wallis, both of whom had known him at Oxford, sought further preferment for him. Even when All Saints' Church, along with much of the town (but not Conant's residence), was destroyed by fire in September 1675, he refused to accept other positions, but remained at his post, preaching for a while at St Peter's, Northampton. A letter of Conant's describing the fire was included in his son's biography of him. In addition to his vicarage, on 8 June 1676 he was installed archdeacon of Norwich, appointed by his father-in-law. On 3 December 1681 he was made a prebend of Worcester Cathedral by the king at the urging of the earl of Radnor, a former pupil. But some royalists resented these favours shown to Conant and accused him of keeping a conventicle, preaching seditious sermons, and giving communion to his congregation while they were seated.<br>
<br>At Northampton, Conant kept special days of humiliation and prayer, and appears to have been a model pastor, visiting the spiritually troubled, comforting the sick, preaching sermons on practical godliness, and dispensing charity out of his own resources. His charity also extended to New England and to French protestants. One volume of his sermons was published in 1693; it bore the title <span class="italic">Sermons Preached on Several Occasions</span>, and was reprinted in a second corrected edition in 1699. Other sermons were published under the same title as volumes two to six, in 1697, 1698, 1703, 1708, and 1722. John Williams, a native of Northamptonshire educated at Oxford while Conant was there, and a royal chaplain who became bishop of Chichester in 1696, was instrumental in bringing about the publication of the first five volumes, and Digby Coates, principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, of the sixth. In a preface to the first volume Conant told the parishioners of All Saints', whom he was too infirm to serve any longer, that he hoped the publication of &#145;plain and practical sermons&#146;, which he had formerly preached to them, would further their &#145;spiritual welfare&#146;.<br>
<br>Conant's general outlook is clear from his published sermons and from twenty-five volumes of sermons in manuscript (Bodleian Library). They exemplify the practical and compassionate divinity common to later seventeenth-century moderate Calvinists: repentance, conversion, holiness, and an earnest longing for &#145;experimental&#146; knowledge of Christ are stressed, while predestination, justification by faith, and the reformed order of salvation are presupposed. Pastoral concerns are foremost, with warnings about hell as well as against melancholy and excessive scrupulosity. The devout are not to inquire into God's decrees, but to do their duty. Conant was also concerned about scoffers at religion and disturbed by misbelief: among the latter, Lutheran consubstantiation, Quaker pharisaism, Roman Catholic idolatry, and Pelagian (that is, Arminian) denial of free grace in justification are mentioned. His sermons also touch on social issues, asserting that the rich must take responsibility for the poor, and condemning the code of honour demanding revenge. He saw special providences in such events as the fire at Northampton.<br>
<br>Contemporaries described Conant as thin and short in stature. In 1686 he became completely blind. He died on 12 March 1694 and was buried in the rebuilt church of All Saints', Northampton, where he was commemorated by a monument and Latin epitaph.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6052"></a><span class="headword">John Conant</span>  (1653/4&#150;1723), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was the eldest son of John Conant and Elizabeth Reynolds. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 8 February 1670, aged sixteen, and graduated BA in 1673. Elected a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1676, he was active in the business of his college and proceeded MA on 29 January 1678. He took the LLD on 22 June 1683, moved to London, and became a member of Gray's Inn. He became a successful advocate at Doctors' Commons. In 1693 he was considered for, but not elected, warden of Merton. He married Mary West, daughter of John West, and inherited his father-in-law's property at Hampton Poyle, Oxfordshire, in 1696, though engaged in lawsuits over the property with her brother John West the younger. When his health deteriorated he moved to Kidlington in Oxfordshire, where he died on 23 August 1723. He wrote a biography of his father that remained in manuscript until publication in 1823.<br>
