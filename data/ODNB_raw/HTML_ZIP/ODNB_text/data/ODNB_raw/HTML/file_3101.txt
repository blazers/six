<span class="headword">Boyd,  Andrew Kennedy Hutchison</span>  (1825&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and author</span>, was born on 3 November 1825 at Auchinleck manse, Ayrshire, the eldest son of James Boyd (1787&#150;1865), minister of the Tron parish, Glasgow, and his wife, Jane Hutchison. He received his earliest education at Ochiltree parish school and then at Ayr Academy (1838&#150;40). In 1840 Boyd moved to London, studying at King's College and then at the Middle Temple; he seemed likely to follow a career at the English bar, but in 1844 his life changed direction on his decision to enter the ministry of the Church of Scotland. He moved to study at the University of Glasgow, first in arts and then in divinity: he was a fine student, winning nine first prizes while studying divinity and receiving his BA in 1846. On completing his studies he was licensed by the presbytery of Ayr and preached his first public sermon in Greenock, Renfrewshire, in October 1850.<br>
<br>Boyd's ministry began in Edinburgh, as an assistant at St George's, with his first individual charge being at Newton upon Ayr (1851&#150;4). This was followed by Kirkpatrick-Irongray (1854&#150;9), St Bernard's, Edinburgh (1859&#150;65), and finally by the first charge of St Andrews from 1865 until his sudden death in 1899. His considerable fame was based on a combination of his reputation as a preacher and on his popularity as a writer, as well as his contributions to debates within the Church of Scotland. His various achievements were recognized by the University of Edinburgh, which granted him the degree of DD in 1864 (when Boyd was only thirty-four); by the University of St Andrews, which awarded him an LLD in 1889; by the Church of Scotland, which elected him to its highest position, moderator of the general assembly, in 1890; and by King's College, London, which made him a fellow in 1895. Boyd married on 12 April 1854 Margaret Buchanan (<i>d</i>. 1895), with whom he had seven children. On 5 April 1897 he married his second wife, Janet Balfour (<i>d</i>. 1917).<br>
<br>It was during Boyd's time at Kirkpatrick-Irongray that relatively light ministerial duties allowed him the time to develop his skill as a writer, and it was by the initials under which he wrote&#151;A. K. H. B.&#151;that he was perhaps best known. He wrote articles for <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, which were eventually published in three series as <span class="italic">The Recreations of a Country Parson</span> (1859, 1861, and 1878), and ran into many editions. His writings were also immensely popular in the United States, where the 1861 series of <span class="italic">The Recreations</span> went through twenty editions. Despite finding writing difficult and even painful, he wrote prodigiously, a mixture of essays, sermons, and reminiscences, including <span class="italic">The Graver Thoughts of a Country Parson</span> (3 ser., 1862, 1865, 1875), <span class="italic">Counsel and Comfort Spoken from a City Pulpit</span> (1863), and <span class="italic">Our Little Life: Essays Consolatory and Domestic</span> (2 ser., 1882, 1884). The semi-autobiographical works <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Years of St Andrews</span> (2 vols., 1892), <span class="italic">St Andrews and Elsewhere</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">The Last Years of St Andrews</span> (1896) provide a fascinating and readable glimpse into his life and times; a detailed diary combined with a tenacious memory meant that very little was forgotten. &#145;Many a time&#146;, said Boyd, &#145;have I wished that my memory was not nearly so good&#146;  (Boyd, <span class="italic">Last Years</span>, 2&#150;3).<br>
<br>As a churchman Boyd's importance was fourfold. First, he was an extremely popular preacher&#151;Robert Story said, &#145;I never knew a man more fond of preaching; and few preached better &hellip; with his earnest and almost emotional manner&#146;  (Story, 91). Second, Boyd was a prominent figure in the contentious late nineteenth-century debate about church and state, with his weight firmly behind the principle of the Church of Scotland remaining an established national church. Third, Boyd's numerous contacts with prominent Anglicans, including J. A. Froude, Richard Whately, A. W. Thorold, A. P. Stanley, H. P. Liddon and R. W. Church, gave the Church of Scotland a reputation and exposure in influential English circles which it would not otherwise have had; &#145;he made its name familiar, its ministry respected, and its history and character, to some extent at least, understood, among people who became interested in it for his sake&#146;  (ibid., 93). &#145;There is no gulf at all&#146;, Boyd claimed, &#145;between the best in the Church of Scotland and the best in the Church of England&#146;  (A. Boyd, <span class="italic">Sermons and Stray Papers</span>, 1907, 41). This view perhaps contributed to his fourth role in Scottish church life as a leading supporter of the move towards the increased use of liturgy in services. An enthusiastic proponent of the use of the Christian year, he was strongly in favour of a more liturgical service and was also instrumental in the Church of Scotland's adoption of <span class="italic">The Scottish Hymnal</span>, approved in 1870. Although his views earned him unpopularity in places, his role was an important one in the general adoption of these principles within the Scottish church.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Boyd suffered recurring bouts of ill health from which he never recovered his customary energy, and in 1898&#150;9 a period of illness persuaded him to go to Bournemouth to recuperate. He died there on 1 March 1899 from accidental poisoning, having taken carbolic lotion which he mistook for a sleeping draught. He was interred in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral, Robert Story, principal of the University of Glasgow, preaching his funeral sermon.<br>
