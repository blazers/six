<span class="headword">Ellis,  Marian Emily</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Marian Emily Cripps, Lady Parmoor]</span>  (1878&#150;1952), <span class="occ">philanthropist and political activist</span>, was born at The Park, Standard Hill, Nottingham, on 6 January 1878, one of the twin daughters of the colliery owner and Liberal MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47628/', "John Edward Ellis (1841&#150;1910)")</script> and his wife, Maria Rowntree (1845&#150;1941), philanthropist, both of whom were Quakers and radicals. She was educated at home and became her politician father's secretary at the time of the Jameson raid (1895). At the close of the subsequent South African War she was involved in Ruth Fry's Quaker relief projects for women victims of that war.<br>
<br>When the First World War rallied young men on both sides to massacre one another for righteousness's sake, Marian Ellis was a steadfast voice against that madness. Not only did she and her twin sister Edith give huge sums of money to relieve the suffering of families of conscientious objectors and finance the No-Conscription Fellowship, but they also gave tirelessly of their moral and intellectual energy. Edith Ellis was imprisoned in Holloway under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span> in 1918 for joining with other Quakers to print a leaflet, <span class="italic">A Challenge to Militarism</span>, without first submitting it to the government censor. Meanwhile Marian Ellis had made a major contribution to Quaker thinking on the issue of &#145;just war&#146;. The collaborative, anonymous Quaker pamphlet <span class="italic">Looking towards Peace</span> (1915), which she had helped to draft, stated:<blockquote>War, tyranny and revolt have produced tyranny, revolt and war throughout time &hellip; We maintain that the moral law is binding upon States as upon individuals &hellip; We hold that the fundamental interests of humanity are one &hellip; The time for absolute isolated sovereignty is gone by &hellip; Our aim should be a very loose international federation &hellip; the reasoned worship of force [is] the real devil-worship &hellip; We therefore keep alight the hope that, late or soon, the intercourse of nations will be carried on without armed force.</blockquote>In 1917 Marian Ellis wrote:<blockquote>At the end of this war the world will have to decide which way it desires to go, towards disarmament or destruction &hellip; Disarmament is not merely scrapping our guns and our battleships. It is the working out of a national policy, which, being inspired by love for all men, cannot be antagonistic &hellip; it is the problem of India, of Ireland, of our relations with Russia and Persia, Germany and Belgium as God would have them to be. (M. Ellis, &#145;Disarmament&#146;, <span class="italic">Friends' Quarterly Examiner</span>, 1917, 182&#150;3)</blockquote>She testified to her unweaponed faith for the rest of her life.In 1919 Marian Ellis helped Kate, Lady Courtney of Penwith, to establish the Fight the Famine Committee. Lady Courtney later wrote of Marian Ellis: &#145;what a splendid worker she is&#151;capable and selfless&#151;a volunteer who does all the grind and most of the paying too&#146;  (Courtney, 177). On 14 July 1919, she married, as his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32629/', "Charles Alfred Cripps, first Baron Parmoor (1852&#150;1941)")</script>, politician; she became the respected sister-in-law of Beatrice Webb. There were no children of the marriage; Marian was, however, an influence upon the youngest son of her husband's first marriage, (Richard) Stafford Cripps.<br>
<br>From 1924 to 1928 Lady Parmoor was president of the World YWCA and she helped found the Fellowship of Reconciliation. A founder member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, she became president of its British section in 1950; she was treasurer of the Friends' Peace Committee and an active vice-president of the National Peace Council. But none of her official committee responsibilities adequately reveals the quality of her spirit. At every depressing turn of world politics she would follow the direction of her idealistic conscience and struggle for the implementation of those ideals in international relations. Thus she advocated the admission of communist China to the United Nations, she urged an end by negotiation to the Korean War, and at the age of seventy she began a serious study of nuclear fission in order to speak with some authority about the uses and dangers of atomic energy. Her last political act, two days before her death, was to help draft a Quaker message to the prime minister protesting against the aerial bombardment of North Korea.<br>
<br>Marian Ellis was a gifted cellist and an attractive and eloquent speaker, whose &#145;obstinate optimism made her one of the most lovable of a notable generation of women&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 July 1952). She died at her home, 1 Endsleigh Street, London, on 6 July 1952 and was cremated at Golders Green; her ashes were taken to Frieth, Buckinghamshire.<br>
