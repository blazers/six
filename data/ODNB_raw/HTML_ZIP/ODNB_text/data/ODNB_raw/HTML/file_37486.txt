<span class="headword">Greenly,  Henry</span>  (1876&#150;1947), <span class="occ">railway engineer and writer</span>, was born on 3 June 1876 at 20 Priory Street, Birkenhead, the first of three sons and two daughters of Edwin Greenly, railway guard, and his wife, Sophia, daughter of John Howard, the owner of a wood-turning factory in Newington Butts, south London. Henry started his education at a boarding-school in Birkenhead but in the spring of 1887 the family moved to the Queen's Park district of west London, where he continued his education at Beethoven Street School in Kilburn Lane until 1890, when he left to work in the jewellery workshops of William Whiteley of Bayswater. His stay was short and was followed by employment at the Commercial Travellers Institute and then Smith, Fawdon, and Law, solicitors.<br>
<br>In 1894 Greenly was awarded a London county council scholarship with distinctions, which took him to the Kenmont Gardens Science School (1894&#150;7) and in 1896 he was awarded an evening exhibition to the Regent Street Polytechnic. The turning point in what became a distinguished career came on 22 February 1897, when he started work in the drawing-office of the Metropolitan Railway Company at Neasden works, where he pursued both mechanics and architecture, being ultimately appointed as assistant to the chief surveyor and architect.<br>
<br>As early as 1895 Greenly was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Engineer</span> and <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, taking the great engineers of the day to task over technical issues, and he soon became well known. As a result, on 15 October 1896, he was appointed to a subcommittee at the Science Museum alongside twenty-five other distinguished engineers, with the objective of establishing a permanent railway museum. With the introduction of the <span class="italic">Model Engineer and Amateur Electrician</span> magazine in 1898 he became a regular contributor and was a founder member of the Society of Model Engineers.<br>
<br>He published numerous books throughout his career, such as <span class="italic">Model Electric Locomotives and Railways</span> (1921), which became the &#145;bible&#146; for the model railway world. The <span class="italic">Model Railways and Locomotives</span> magazine was founded by him in 1908 and became a platform from which he could share his knowledge and expertise with others. His association with Bassett-Lowke Ltd of Northampton, the world-famous model engineering company, as design consultant led to a remarkable career in the early development of miniature passenger-carrying railways.<br>
<br>Apart from many ventures, such as the Rhyl Miniature Railway and the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, Greenly's most notable success was his involvement with the Romney, Hythe, and Dymchurch Railway in Kent (1925&#150;9). In 1915 he joined the design staff of the Royal Aircraft Factory in Farnborough, where he invented the &#145;flash eliminator&#146; for machine-guns and in 1937 patented an inductor relay for lift control and automatic train control.<br>
<br>On 28 September 1901, at the church of St Bartholomew, Gray's Inn Road, London, Greenly had married Lilly Maria, daughter of Henry Richardson, a London businessman. They had a daughter and two sons. By 1942 Greenly was in ill health but still carried on the family model engineering business. He died at his home, 66 Heston Road, Heston, Isleworth, on 4 March 1947 and was buried at Heston parish church. He was survived by his wife, who when she died in 1967 was buried beside him.<br>
