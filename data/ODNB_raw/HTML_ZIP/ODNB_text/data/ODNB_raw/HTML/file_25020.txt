<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sedley,  Catharine</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Dorchester, and countess of Portmore  (1657&#150;1717), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, born on 21 December 1657 at Great Queen Street, London, and baptized eight days later at St Giles-in-the-Fields, was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25021/', "Sir Charles Sedley (bap. 1639, d. 1701)")</script> and his wife, Lady Catherine Savage (<i>d</i>. 1707), daughter of John Savage, Earl Rivers. As early as June 1673 Evelyn spoke of Catherine Sedley as &#145;none of the virtuous, but a wit&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.13). The Countess Cowper later thought that &#145;Lady Dorchester's Wit makes Amends for her Ugliness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 74). The earl of Dorset, on the other hand, in one of his four poems about her, would dismiss her &#145;false pretence to wit and parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems of Charles Sackville</span>, 44). Her plain appearance was widely reported, but may have been exaggerated, as some of those who commented on it, including Charles II, did so to belittle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14593/', "James II (1633&#150;1701)")</script>. In 1676 Sir Winston and Lady Churchill were anxious for a match between their eldest son, John Churchill (afterwards first duke of Marlborough), and Catharine, his distant kinswoman, but these negotiations were soon broken off. Two years later she obtained a position at court as one of the maids of honour to the duchess of York and thus came to the attention of the duke. Before long she had supplanted Arabella Churchill as James's principal mistress. Persistent rumours also linked her to James's keeper of the privy purse, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11196/', "James Grahme (1650&#150;1730)")</script>, and Grahme himself is said to have believed that he was the real father of the children she claimed were the duke's  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 18.193). On becoming king in 1685 James broke off the affair as a moral example to the court, doing the decent thing by setting her up with her own house in St James's Square (no. 21, the house formerly occupied by Arabella Churchill). Three months later two of the leading Anglican courtiers, the earls of Rochester and Dartmouth, contrived her return to favour, in the hope that she would be a protestant counterweight to the king's Catholic advisers. Grahme, as keeper of the privy buckhounds, was able to arrange secret assignations for the king while he was supposedly out hunting  (E. Campana de Cavelli, <span class="italic">Les derniers Stuarts</span>, 2 vols., 1871, 2.75, 89). This ploy met with little success, except that James, by a patent of 20 January 1686, created her baroness of Darlington and countess of Dorchester for life. The queen was appalled and made her distress obvious when she next appeared in public. The Catholic advisers, led by the king's chaplain, Bonaventure Giffard, took the hint and demanded that the countess be banished. James almost immediately gave way. Withdrawing first to St James's Square, she refused to go abroad and, as a compromise, agreed to go into internal exile in Ireland. As a generous pay-off, she was granted an annual pension of &pound;3000 to last until 1691, when she was promised quitrents worth &pound;5000 per annum from extensive estates in Ireland. On arrival in Dublin she found it &#145;intolerable&#146; and the Irish &#145;mallincoly&#146;  (De Sola Pinto, 346). In August 1686 she returned to England, on the pretext of taking the waters at Tunbridge Wells  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1686&#150;7</i>, 253), whereupon the king discreetly resumed their affair. Following James's overthrow, her friendship with the Grahmes, Dartmouth, and the Hydes linked her to the most important group of Jacobite conspirators in London.<br>
<br>The countess certainly made no secret of her lack of respect for the new king and queen. Presented at court in April 1689, she offended Queen Mary by telling her that &#145;If I have broke one commandement, you have another; and what I did wase more naturall&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of the Family of Hatton</span>, ed. E. M. Thompson, 2 vols., 1878, 2.128&#150;9). A remark made to the earl of Ailesbury at about the same time implied that she wanted William III assassinated  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.254&#150;5). In July 1690 she was called in for questioning by the government and remained a major suspect. Despite this, she successfully claimed part of her pension, and in 1703 the Irish parliament confirmed her right to her Irish rents. It helped that in August 1696 she had married one of William III's army officers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6015/', "Sir David Colyear, second baronet (bap. 1657, d. 1730)")</script>, who was created a baron in 1699 and earl of Portmore in the Scottish peerage four years later. Dorchester retained her caustic wit to the end, for, encountering both the duchess of Portsmouth and the countess of Orkney, mistresses to Charles II and William III, at court during the reign of George I, she famously quipped, &#145;God! who would have thought that we three royal whores should meet here!&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 18.193). She died at Bath, Somerset, on 26 October 1717, and was buried there. Twelve years later her body was transferred to the new Portmore vault in the church at Weybridge, Surrey, where she had owned a house since the late 1680s.<br>
<br>With her husband, the earl of Portmore, who survived until 2 January 1730, she had two sons&#151;David, Viscount Melsington (<i>d</i>. 1729), and Charles Colyear, second earl of Portmore (1700&#150;1785). With the duke of York (afterwards James II) she seems to have had several children who died young. The only child who lived to maturity was Lady Katherine Darnley; she married, on 28 October 1699, James Annesley, third earl of Anglesey, from whom, on account of alleged cruelty on his part, she was separated by act of parliament on 12 June 1701  (<span class="italic">Westmorland MSS</span>, 336). After his death, in January 1702, she married, secondly, on 16 March 1706, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25297/', "John Sheffield, first duke of Buckingham and Normanby")</script>; she died on 13 March 1743, and was interred, with almost regal pomp, in Westminster Abbey. With her first husband she had an only daughter, Catherine, who married William, son of Sir Constantine Phipps, lord chancellor of Ireland. With her second husband she had a son, Edmund, who succeeded to the title and estates, but, dying unmarried during his mother's lifetime, bequeathed to her all the Sheffield family property. These estates (excluding those successfully claimed in the court of chancery by Buckingham's illegitimate son Charles Sheffield) she left by will to her grandson, Constantine Phipps, first Baron Mulgrave, whose grandson, Constantine Henry Phipps, on his elevation to the marquessate, assumed the title of Normanby.<br>
