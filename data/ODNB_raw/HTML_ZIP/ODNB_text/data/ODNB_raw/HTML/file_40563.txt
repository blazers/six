<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sime,  Sidney Herbert</span>  (1864<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1941), <span class="occ">illustrator and caricaturist</span>, was born between 1864 and 1867 in the Hulme district of Manchester, the second of six children of David and Helen Sime, who were both Scottish. His marriage register entry (1898) gave his age as 31, meaning he would have been born in 1866 or 1867; however, in the letter of administration taken out by his widow in 1941 his age was put at 76, suggesting that he was born in 1864 or 1865. According to his nephew John Sime it was probably the latter. Nothing is known about his parents beyond the fact that when he was an infant they moved to Liverpool, where his father was employed in a furniture warehouse.<br>
<br>Sime probably received little formal education before going to work underground in a Yorkshire colliery. His five years as a pit boy left him with memories of pushing trolleys down tunnels only 2&#150;3 feet high and nearly being buried alive by a roof-fall. He then worked for a linen draper, a shoemaker, and a baker before becoming successful as a signwriter. This enabled him to attend Liverpool School of Art, where he won prizes for drawing in 1885 and 1888 and decided on a career as an illustrator. He moved to London, probably in 1893.<br>
<br>Sime's first illustrations were made for the halfpenny comic papers. His breakthrough came in 1895 when the magazine <span class="italic">Pick-Me-Up</span>, which employed distinguished artists, started to publish his cartoons about the afterlife. Treating the netherworld with ominous humour (perhaps connected with his experience down the mine), his cartoons upset the devout and created something of a sensation. Soon his sombre fantasies were appearing in many magazines, notably <span class="italic">The Idler</span>, <span class="italic">The Sketch</span>, <span class="italic">The Butterfly</span>, and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span>. Between autumn 1897 and February 1898 he edited the short-lived magazine <span class="italic">Eureka</span>, in which post he took a nonchalant view of his duties. At the end of 1897 Sime was being talked of as one of the country's leading artists in black and white, influenced like most of his contemporaries by Beardsley and Japanese prints but a pioneer of the comic-grotesque style  (<span class="italic">Windsor Magazine</span>, December 1897).<br>
<br>Another side of Sime's talent was seen in the theatrical caricatures published in <span class="italic">Pick-Me-Up</span> in 1896&#150;8 and <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> in 1902&#150;4. Sir David Low praised Sime for these, describing him as &#145;the most notable&#146; of the theatrical caricaturists of the nineties, &#145;a beautifully imaginative artist with a mordant fancy which sometimes overlaid his observation of character but whose studies of people nevertheless are full of fine and well-balanced caricature&#146;  (Low, 38). As well as cartooning, Sime also painted allegories, portraits, and landscapes in oil, some of which were exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists between 1896 and 1903.<br>
<br>Sime's uncle, William Sime, who had been a prosperous solicitor in Edinburgh, died in 1898, leaving him about &pound;14,000 and a house with a small estate at Aberfoyle, Perthshire. In the same year on 14 July he married in Edinburgh Mary Susan Pickett, a miniature painter and illustrator. For the next few years they spent half their time at Aberfoyle, where Sime painted landscapes.<br>
<br>With some of his new wealth, Sime bought <span class="italic">The Idler</span> and installed himself as co-editor in 1899. Partly through his own neglect it proved a disastrous investment, with Sime selling the goodwill in 1901 for &pound;5. After 1900 he had a diminishing appetite for magazine illustration, but in 1905 he was tempted to visit the United States by William Randolph Hearst. Despite being offered a handsome retainer he stayed only six months.<br>
<br>From the magazines which he called &#145;those God-forsaken sponge-cakes of the suburban soul&#146;  (letter to Josef Holbrooke, 18 Aug 1910, priv. coll.) Sime turned to illustrating books, predominantly the fantasies of Edward Plunkett, eighteenth baron of Dunsany. Starting in 1905 with <span class="italic">The Gods of Pegana</span>, Dunsany's tales of wonder, set in other worlds and written in prose-poetry, gave Sime, in Rossetti's phrase, a perfect opportunity for &#145;allegorizing on one's own hook&#146;. While illustrating ten books (some with only a frontispiece) he went to stay with Dunsany at his castle in Ireland, where he proved a highly entertaining guest.<br>
<br>Another noble collaborator and generous friend was Thomas Scott-Ellis, eighth Baron Howard de Walden. Like Dunsany he had a preoccupation with myth and a conviction that Sime was a genius. Sime designed sets and costumes for the trilogy of operas based on the <span class="roman">Mabinogion</span>, staged in 1912, 1914, and 1929, for which Holbrooke wrote the music and Howard de Walden the libretto.<br>
<br>In 1903 Sime had bought Crown Cottage, Worplesdon, Surrey, which he converted from a public house. After selling his house in Scotland he lived there for the rest of his life, increasingly withdrawn from the art world. Given a measure of independence by his inheritance and supported by his noble patrons, he painted when he felt inclined. Walter Emanuel wrote, &#145;one of the most acute individualities in the world of black-and-white is Mr. S. H. Sime&#151;that he produces so little nowadays is a calamity&#146;. He called Sime &#145;a great master of the grotesque&#146;  (<span class="italic">Strand Magazine</span>, November 1915, 592). In July 1918 Sime was conscripted into the Army Service Corps, and on 11 November, armistice day, he was invalided out. His <span class="italic">Bogey Beasts</span> with music by Josef Holbrooke was published in 1923, and reasonably successful exhibitions of his work were held at the St George's Gallery, London, in 1924 and 1927; otherwise he spurned dealers, read voraciously (acquiring a deep knowledge of William Blake and other visionary writers), backed horses, and spent every evening at the local public house.<br>
<br>Sime's strong personality and powers of conversation could astonish his audience. During his youth his appearance was as outr&eacute; as his art: Max Beerbohm's caricature published in <span class="italic">The Idler</span> of August 1900 made him look like a Buddha in a bearskin. The novelist Desmond Coke called his presence &#145;overwhelming, as of a chunky Chinese idol&#146; and his conversation &#145;shattering&#146;  (Coke, 225).<br>
<br>Sime's originality in appearance, conversation, and darkly imaginative art, coupled with his rise from pit boy to magazine proprietor, was such as to make him a &#145;man of the nineties&#146;, the friend of Max Beerbohm and Frank Harris, and one of the creators of the <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> mood. His decline after the turn of the century was due partly to his contemptuous rejection of the art market and partly to the change in taste whereby the public came to see humour and weird fantasy as incompatible. Apart from a small coterie, the hyperbole evaporated, but Sime continued to have admirers: Dr Gordon N. Ray wrote in 1976, &#145;of all the English black-and-white artists more or less in the Beardsley tradition he was the most original&#146;  (Ray, 201).<br>
<br>Sime died on 21 May 1941 at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, and was buried nearby in the graveyard of Worplesdon parish church. His widow died in 1949, leaving his remaining pictures, with an endowment, to the trustees of the Worplesdon Memorial Hall to form the Sime Gallery. The couple had no children.<br>
