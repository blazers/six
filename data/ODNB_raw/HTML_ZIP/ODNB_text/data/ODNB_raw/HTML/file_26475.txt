<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  Houston</span>  (1791&#150;1875), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, fifth baronet (1766&#150;1825), and his cousin Catharine (<i>d</i>. 1849), youngest daughter of Sir William Maxwell, baronet, was born on 2 August 1791 at Springkell, near Kirtlebridge, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Dr Horne's school in Chiswick, Middlesex. He entered the navy in February 1805 on the <i>Medusa</i> with Sir John Gore, and in her went to Calcutta. On his return he followed Gore to the <i>Revenge</i>, and in October 1806 was moved to the <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i>, then commanded by Lord Cochrane, and shared in the many incidents of that remarkable commission, including the defence of Rosas. In December 1808 he was put in command of an armed xebec, which he had assisted in cutting out from under the batteries of Port Vendres, and was sent on an independent cruise in the Mediterranean. He did not return to Gibraltar until the <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i> had sailed for England, and was unable to join her until after the battle of Aix Roads. He was, however, in her in the expedition to Walcheren, after which he was, during the winter, on the books of the flagship at Leith. Through the summer of 1810 he was in the <i>Hussar</i> in the Baltic, and in 1811 was again in the Leith flagship until he was promoted lieutenant on 1 August.<br>
<br>On 16 August 1811 Stewart was appointed to the <i>Tigre</i> (74 guns, Captain John Halliday) and served off Rochefort; in the two following years he was Admiral Lord Keith's signal lieutenant in the channel, at first in the <i>San Josef</i> and then in the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>. On 3 March 1814 he was appointed acting captain of the <i>Clarence</i> (74 guns) off Brest, but returned to the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> at the end of April. On 9 June he was appointed commander of the <i>Podargus</i> (14 guns), and was confirmed in that rank on 13 August 1814. During the next three years he commanded various sloops on the Jamaica station; in March 1817 he was acting captain of the <i>Pique</i> and in May of the <i>Salisbury</i>, to which he was confirmed on 10 June 1817. He remained in the <i>Salisbury</i> as flag captain to Rear-Admiral John Erskine Douglas until April 1818. He married, on 10 February 1819, Martha, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18742/', "Sir William Miller, Lord Glenlee")</script>; they had three sons, the eldest of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36300/', "Admiral Sir William Houston Stewart")</script>. Around the time of this marriage, his father settled the Roxburgh estate in Tobago upon him; Stewart was still owner of the estate in 1836 when he was awarded compensation for the emancipation of the 143 enslaved people on the estate.<br>
<br>From October 1823 to December 1826 Stewart commanded the frigate <i>Menai</i> on the North American station, and for two winters had charge of Halifax Dockyard. In August 1837 he was unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for Renfrewshire. In 1839 he went to the Mediterranean in the <i>Benbow</i>, which in the following year he commanded off the coast of Syria and at the capture of Acre under Admiral Sir Robert Stopford. For this campaign he was nominated CB on 18 December 1840. In 1846 he was for a few months superintendent of Woolwich Dockyard; in November 1846 he was appointed controller-general of the coastguard, a post he held until 1850, when he was appointed a lord of the Admiralty. On 16 June 1851 he was promoted rear-admiral. From February 1850 to March 1852 he was at the Admiralty, and during the latter part of that time was whig/liberal MP for Greenwich.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1853 Stewart went to the Mediterranean as third in command and superintendent at Malta, where he remained until January 1855, when he served as second in command in the Black Sea under Sir Edmund Lyons, notably at the capture of Kinburn. He was nominated KCB on 5 July 1855, and received the grand cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and the Mejidiye (first class). For some months in 1856 he was superintendent of Devonport Dockyard, and from November 1856 to January 1860 was commander-in-chief on the North American station; he became a vice-admiral on 30 July 1857. From October 1860 to October 1863 he was commander-in-chief at Devonport. He became admiral on 10 November 1862, GCB on 28 March 1865, and admiral of the fleet on 20 October 1872. He died at his home, Dourie Bank, Port William, Wigtownshire, on 10 December 1875.<br>
<br>Stewart was a very capable administrator, as he demonstrated at Woolwich, with the coastguard, on the Admiralty board, and at Malta. His handling of the supply side of the 1854 Black Sea campaign from Malta earned him the chance to fly his flag afloat, though Lyons rarely gave him an opportunity to act alone. His career after 1815 was dominated by the Scottish whig connection, especially Lord Panmure, his political leader in the period after 1840.<br>
