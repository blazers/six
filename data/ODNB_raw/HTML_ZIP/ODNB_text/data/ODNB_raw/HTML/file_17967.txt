<span class="headword">Sutton,  Thomas  Manners-</span>, first Baron Manners of Foston  (1756&#150;1842), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born Thomas Manners on 24 February 1756, the fifth son of Lord George Manners (1723&#150;1783) and his first wife, Diana (<i>d</i>. 1767), daughter of Thomas Chaplin of Blankney, Lincolnshire. His paternal grandfather was John Manners, third duke of Rutland. In 1772 his father took the additional surname of Sutton on inheriting the estates of his maternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26805/', "Robert Sutton, second Baron Lexington")</script>, from his elder brother Lord Robert Manners-Sutton. He was at Charterhouse School from 1769 and matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 1 March 1773. His elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17964/', "Charles Manners-Sutton")</script>, later archbishop of Canterbury, matriculated at Emmanuel on the same day. Thomas worked hard at Cambridge, graduating as fifth wrangler in 1777. While still an undergraduate he had entered Lincoln's Inn on 16 November 1775. He was called to the bar in November 1780, his years of &#145;diligence and application&#146; as a law student having left him &#145;well qualified to practise his profession&#146;  (O'Flanagan, 338).<br>
<br>Despite his strong academic record and his family connections Manners-Sutton's progress at the bar was slow. Over the years however he built up a considerable chancery practice and obtained a number of minor judicial preferments. He was at various times a commissioner of bankrupts (1783&#150;97), recorder of Grantham, temporal chancellor of the palatinate of Durham, and chief justice of Anglesey (from July 1797 until 1802), covering the north Wales circuit.<br>
<br>Manners-Sutton also ventured into politics, succeeding his brother John in the family seat of Newark in 1796, where he supported William Pitt the younger. His political career, rarely high-profile, was never permitted to interfere with his legal practice. He took silk on 2 July 1800 and was appointed a bencher of Lincoln's Inn on 16 July. At the same time Pitt appointed him solicitor-general to George, prince of Wales. In this latter capacity he addressed the Commons on 17 February 1802, asserting the prince's claims to those revenues from the duchy of Cornwall that had been collected during his minority. His subsequent motion for a committee to investigate the question was defeated but he had won the support of a large minority from both sides of the house and both Pitt and Charles James Fox praised his performance. In May 1802 he was appointed solicitor-general in Henry Addington's administration, although he made a point of obtaining Prince George's consent before accepting, and he was knighted on 19 May. He remained a confidant of the prince and continued to support him when matters affecting him were debated in the Commons.<br>
<br>Manners-Sutton's appointment to the solicitor-generalship did not increase his parliamentary profile but it did lead to his involvement in some cases of note. In February 1803 he took part in the prosecution for high treason of Colonel Edward Despard, who had attempted to seize the Tower of London and the Bank of England the previous November. Manners-Sutton displayed &#145;great legal astuteness&#146;  (O'Flanagan, 338) and much &#145;temperance and ability&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 372) in the prosecution and, though he was a chancery lawyer by training, his handling of the witnesses and his knowledge of crown law were extremely good. Also in February 1803 he played a small role in the prosecution of Jean-Gabriel Peltier for libelling Napoleon Bonaparte in his poem <span class="italic">Le 18 Brumaire an VIII</span>. On 4 November 1803 at Bentley Priory, Stanmore, he married Anne, daughter of Sir Joseph Copley, bt. She died suddenly on 5 August 1814 at Thomas's Hotel, Berkeley Square; they had no children.<br>
<br>On the retirement of Beaumont Hotham, Manners-Sutton was raised to the bench on 4 February 1805 as a baron of the exchequer, having resigned his Commons seat. He served in this role for two unremarkable years until, in April 1807, Spencer Perceval appointed him lord chancellor of Ireland. On 20 April 1807 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Manners of Foston, Lincolnshire, and was sworn of the British and Irish privy councils on 22 April and 12 May respectively.<br>
<br>Lord Manners served as lord chancellor of Ireland for an unbroken period of twenty years, the second longest tenure of that office. As the senior Irish equity judge Manners performed quite adequately, although he was clearly not of the calibre of Eldon or Redesdale. Foss says that his decisions were held &#145;in high estimation&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 372) but he is probably best described as a workmanlike judge; he disposed swiftly of his cases, seeking always to do justice, &#145;not, indeed, deeply read, but evincing ability to understand and judgment to decide&#146;  (O'Flanagan, 339). One of his most important judicial decisions was that on <i>Commissioners of Donations v. Walsh</i> (1823), where he upheld as a valid charitable trust a bequest for masses in the will of Mrs Judith Rush. The decision has been regarded as the root of modern Irish case law in this area and also indicated that Manners did not necessarily pursue his political opposition to Catholicism inside the courts.<br>
<br>Several nineteenth-century commentators politically opposed to Manners depicted him as a privileged oaf, unsuited to judicial office and owing his position solely to family connections. He certainly made some mistakes and was on occasion candidly aware of his limitations; in 1824, for instance, he confessed to having &#145;very little confidence&#146; in his construction of a bequest by Viscount Powerscourt, and expressed the hope that the case might proceed to the House of Lords for further consideration  (J. Comyn, <span class="italic">Irish at Law</span>, 1981, 80). Nevertheless he remained on the Irish woolsack for two decades, spanning a number of administrations, and, according to Oliver Burke, of his 4469 decisions only fourteen were reversed and seven modified. Many of Manners's judgments were published in the Irish law reports of the period, mostly in Ball and Beatty's chancery reports.<br>
<br>Manners's execution of his legal duties was fairly unremarkable, though by no means inadequate, but his presence as a politician and administrator was more keenly felt. His critics alleged that he &#145;entertained violent ascendancy principles&#146; and &#145;cordially detested&#146; both the Irish Roman Catholics and those protestants who supported Catholic emancipation  (O'Flanagan, 352, 354&#150;5). He reduced Catholic spheres of influence in so far as he could, dismissing numerous Catholics from the magistracy and refusing to appoint them to those few posts (such as commissioner of bankrupts) which, prior to emancipation, were open to them. It has been noted that &#145;emancipationists, be they Protestant or Catholic, were the objects of the Chancellor's pious detestation, and they were accordingly subjected to countless annoyances&#146;  (Burke, 197). It is questionable however whether Manners was quite so small-minded in this regard as his critics have claimed. One frequently recounted story concerns his refusal to recommend the grant of the honour of earls' children to the siblings of the young Joseph Leeson, fourth earl of Milltown. The story has it that Manners refused to assist because the children's mother had married Valentine Lawless, second Baron Cloncurry, a Catholic peer and ardent emancipationist. Manners strenuously denied such pettiness, and the fact that the grant was made to the Milltown children in 1817, as they approached maturity, when Earl Talbot replaced Lord Whitworth as viceroy, goes some way to supporting that denial.<br>
<br>Manners was assisted in both his legal and political roles by William Saurin, his attorney-general from 1807 to 1822 and himself an ardent anti-emancipationist. A contemporary writer observed:<blockquote>daily the business of the government of Ireland was done by the two legal functionaries of kindred spirits, as they regularly walked down every morning from Stephen's Green to the Four Courts &hellip; with arms linked and solemn steps, and bended brows, settling affairs of state. (O'Flanagan, 354)</blockquote>Neither would countenance the appointment of a Catholic to any position of influence and both insisted that only protestants of unquestionable ability would enjoy their patronage.Manners also participated in the House of Lords, including the so-called trial of Queen Caroline in 1820. He raised a number of evidential points during the debates and on 4 November delivered a speech in which he opined that the queen's adultery had been fully established and that the divorce should be granted so as to make an example of her for the moral good of the country. In 1829 he argued strenuously against Catholic emancipation in the form of the <span class="roman">Roman Catholic Relief Bill</span>, although he subsequently confessed that he might have been wrong in voting against it, and hoped that it might calm the Irish situation and strengthen the government. In April of the same year however he spoke in support of the <span class="roman">Qualification of Freeholders (Ireland) Bill</span>, which disenfranchised the 40<i>s</i>. freeholders, many of whom were Catholic. These final assaults on Irish Catholicism marked the end of his participation in the Lords.<br>
<br>Manners finally retired from the Irish woolsack in November 1827. He would have retired earlier but stayed on at the request of George IV, who wanted him to remain until a &#145;proper Protestant successor&#146; could be found  (Kenny, 137). He returned to England immediately and spent most of his time at his country residence, Fornham Hall, near Bury St Edmunds. After his participation in the disenfranchisement and emancipation debates he retired from public life, living out a long retirement with his second wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1846), daughter of James Butler, ninth Baron Cahir, whom he had married at Baronscourt, near Newtownstewart, in co. Tyrone, on 28 October 1815.<br>
<br>Aside from his strong views on Catholic emancipation Manners was an attractive personality. On the bench he was &#145;attentive, decorous, gentlemanlike, [and] distinguished for his urbanity&#146;  (O'Flanagan, 339), although he disliked being challenged by counsel when he had made up his mind on a point. Even political adversaries had to admit that in private Manners was &#145;a perfect gentleman&#146;  (Curran, 10); he was &#145;dignified, courteous, just and generous&#146;  (ibid., 9), with strong moral instincts and a very perceptible charm, and despite the strength of his political views he invariably did not let them stand in the way of his friendships.<br>
<br>While he was lord chancellor Manners lived in considerable style in the mansion at 51 Stephen's Green East, Dublin (now the Office of Public Works). On Sundays he and Lady Manners would walk to St Peter's Church, preceded by their ten servants, walking two by two. Away from law and politics Manners was an enthusiastic shot and was often seen at Carton, seat of the duke of Leinster, or at Baronscourt, seat of the marquess of Abercorn, in his sporting attire&#151;his chancellor's hat, which resembled a bishop's mitre, a green jacket, a scarlet waistcoat, silk breeches, and long black gaiters.<br>
<br>Manners died on 31 May 1842 at his London house in Brook Street and was buried at Kelham in Nottinghamshire. Manners and his second wife had one surviving child, John Thomas Manners-Sutton, second Baron Manners of Foston (1818&#150;1864). Manners was very fond of his son and heir and occasionally brought him to court to sit with his father on the bench. His grandson John Thomas Manners, third Baron Manners of Foston (1852&#150;1927), is remarkable for having ridden his own horses to victory in the 1882 Grand National and the 1882 Grand Military Gold Cup&#151;the only two races that he ever rode in.<br>
