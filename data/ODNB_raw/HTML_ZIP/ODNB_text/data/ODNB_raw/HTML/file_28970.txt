<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Weelkes,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576?, <em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was probably the son of John Weeke, rector of Elsted in Sussex, and his wife, Johanne, who was baptized at Elsted on 25 October 1576. Weeke held this living in plurality with that of Twyford and Owslebury, near Winchester, and his case for paternity is strengthened by the fact that the dedicatee of Weelkes's first publication, <span class="italic">Madrigals to 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6 Voices</span> (1597) was George Phillpot, who lived in Compton Place, only 1 mile from Twyford, and that Winchester College, barely 2 miles away, was where Weelkes received his first confirmed appointment&#151;as organist, evidently in 1598. Certainly at this date Weelkes was still very young for he wrote in the preface to his <span class="italic">Ballets and Madrigals to Five Voices</span> (1598) of &#145;my yeeres yet unripened&#146;, also noting that he had earlier been in the service of &#145;his Maister Edward Darcye Esquire, Groome of hir Majesties privie Chamber&#146;.<br>
<br>Little is known of Weelkes's life during the three or four years that he passed at Winchester College. There is some suspicion that he felt out of place in what was one of the leading schools in the country, being proficient only in music: &#145;this small facultie of mine, because it is alone in mee, and without the asistance of other more confident sciences, is the more to bee favored&#146; he pleaded in the preface to his <span class="italic">Madrigals of 5 and 6 Parts, Apt for the Viols and Voices</span> (1600). Certainly it is difficult to believe that the sometimes extraordinary music that he wrote during this phase would have found ready approval from the staff of the college, for what he published between 1597 and 1600 contained some of the boldest music yet conceived in England, and the best of the twenty works in his 1600 volume are among the greatest of all English madrigals. In the three-voice &#145;Cease sorrows now&#146;, from his 1597 volume, Weelkes had already opened up a vein of musical pathos that was by now commonplace in the madrigal as composed in its native Italy but that was quite unprecedented in English music; at the opposite expressive extreme, in the ballets of 1598 he had revelled in a degree of rhythmic vitality as yet unmatched in the music of his own country. In the volume of 1600, however, Weelkes's radicalism was consummated, above all perhaps in two compositions: the five-voice &#145;O care, thou wilt despatch me&#146; and the six-voice &#145;Thule, the period of cosmography&#146;. In the former, using the structure of the normally vivacious ballet with its &#145;fa-la&#146; refrains, Weelkes set a grief-ridden text to grave music filled with dissonance and, at the opening of its second half, startling chromatic harmony against which the intervening fa-la refrains seem like nostalgic reflections of that joy of which the lyric itself despairs. It was a brilliant conception, brilliantly worked. But &#145;Thule&#146;, a setting of a text which listed some of the wonders of the world that travellers had begun to report upon during the preceding century, was even bolder. It was the text's imaginative suggestions, especially the volcanic ones, that set Weelkes's inventiveness ablaze: Hekla's &#145;sulphureous fire&#146;, &#145;Trinacrean Etna's flames&#146;, and above all &#145;how strangely Fogo burns&#146;, an image which drew from Weelkes perhaps the weirdest chromatic passage in all English music of the period. Also vastly impressive is &#145;As Vesta was from Latmos Hill descending&#146;, which Weelkes contributed to <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Oriana</span> (1601), the collection of madrigals assembled in praise of the aged Queen Elizabeth; especially striking is his treatment of the final line, &#145;Long live fair Oriana&#146;, where the melodic idea setting these words is repeated to saturation point in the upper five voice parts, while this same idea, in twelve-fold augmentation, also provides the bass, thus directing the music's harmonic course. It was a unique procedure&#151;monolithic, sonorous, and pulsating with concentrated energy&#151;that Weelkes also used in other madrigals. In fact Weelkes's Winchester phase was, for all his youth, creatively the most brilliant, perhaps even the supreme peak, of his composing career. His one remaining madrigalian publication, <span class="italic">Ayres or Fantastic Spirits for Three Voices</span> (1608), containing some attractive, tuneful pieces, is relatively unimportant, as is his handful of compositions for keyboard and viol consort.<br>
<br>At some time between October 1601 and October 1602 Weelkes moved to Chichester Cathedral as organist and <i>informator choristarum</i>. By 1605 he had been appointed a Sherborne clerk, one of four such lay singers' positions. His career was advancing well; on 13 July 1602 he had been admitted BMus of Oxford University and now, with a yearly income of &pound;15 2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. plus accommodation and other gratuities, he was well provided for. On 20 February 1603 he married Elizabeth Sandham, daughter of a wealthy Chichester merchant. There were at least three children of the marriage: Thomas, baptized on 9 June, less than four months after the marriage, and two daughters&#151;Alice, baptized on 17 September 1606, and Katherine, of whose baptism there is no record, but who is mentioned in her father's will. During Weelkes's early years at Chichester there is nothing to suggest that he did not give good and efficient service to the cathedral, and on the title-page of his final madrigalian publication (1608) he is styled &#145;Gentleman of his Majesty's Chapel&#146;, though the chapel's own records never mention him and at most he must have been only a gentleman-extraordinary.<br>
<br>However, in the following year, 1609, Weelkes was declared contumacious for not attending the bishop's visitation; his personal decline had begun. True he was not the only disorderly member of the cathedral establishment, though in due course he would become its most celebrated. In December 1613 he was accused of a &#145;fama publica ebrietatis&#146;  (Chichester Diocesan RO, Ep.1/18/31). No further action was taken against him, nor were there any personal consequences when, two years later, the archbishop's visitation exposed a deplorable state of affairs, Weelkes and ten other choirmen being sternly upbraided for failure to attend cathedral services. In May 1616 he was for the first time singled out for negligence, and the cathedral chapter prescribed for him a very precise schedule for training the choirboys. This was reaffirmed at the bishop's visitation in September, which also discovered that Weelkes had not been properly performing his duties during divine service itself. Matters came to a head in October, when he was brought before the chapter to answer the charge that he had become notorious both for drunkenness and for outrageous blaspheming. Because he was unable to produce witnesses who would testify for him, on 16 January 1617 he was dismissed as organist and <i>informator choristarum</i>, though he retained his Sherborne clerkship.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Weelkes remained unreformed, and in 1619 William Lawes, the sub-chanter, reported that, while most of the choir behaved in a seemly manner during prayers, Weelkes frequently turned up so &#145;disguised&#146; from the tavern or alehouse that he would utter curses and oaths that both profaned the service and outraged those who were present. Moreover, Lawes added, despite numerous admonitions from the bishop, Weelkes not only continued to behave thus every day but was even tending to get worse. Yet this still had no adverse consequences for him, nor was there any reaction even to the report made to the bishop during his visitation of 1622 by two of the four Sherborne clerks that, while three of them were performing their duties as required by the statutes, Weelkes was not. Most surprising of all, in the accounts for the financial year to Michaelmas 1622 Weelkes reappears as organist. On 7 September, however, he buried his wife and his own end came a year later. By then he had clearly been living for some time in the parish of St Bride's in London, for his will, made on 30 November 1623, acknowledges a 50<i>s</i>. debt for board and lodging. His death followed swiftly, and the next day, 1 December, he was buried in the church of St Bride's, Fleet Street. His possessions proved insufficient to cover his debts, and the site of his grave is unknown. The close friend at whose house he died was called, ironically, Henry Drinkwater.<br>
<br>None of Weelkes's church music can be dated precisely but presumably most of it was composed during his Chichester years. While single madrigals of his were sporadically printed in the late eighteenth century and three of his complete collections (1597, 1598, and 1608) were issued in the nineteenth, not one of his verse anthems saw print until 1966, and until recently his church music had been badly underestimated. In fact Weelkes was one of the most important church composers of his time. He wrote both services (music for the standard texts in the morning and evening rituals, and in the eucharist) and anthems, in both forms using the two established types: the full type, written for voices only, and the verse type, where choruses for the full choir alternated with verses for soloist(s), the organ accompanying throughout. As a composer of services Weelkes was by far the most prolific of all major Elizabethan and Jacobean composers, producing ten in all (seven verse, and three full), though sadly most survive incomplete.<br>
<br>Some of Weelkes's verse services and verse anthems are studiedly restrained in manner, with relatively simple choruses, and these, one suspects, were designed for Chichester, where they would not have overstretched the limited musical resources of that establishment. But others are far grander&#151;the spacious <span class="italic">In medio chori</span> service employs an additional semi-chorus placed between the choirstalls and the service for trebles exploits the brilliance of the boys' voices at the top of their range, while the grand verse anthems &#145;Give the king thy judgements&#146; and &#145;Christ rising&#146; were surely envisaged for performance in the Chapel Royal; the latter is a particularly impressive piece. The prevailing (though not exclusive) musical demand in the Church of England was for dignified and sober compositions, and Weelkes's full anthems fall into two categories, the style of some clearly designed to be acceptable for general church use as allowed for in the morning and evening liturgies, and others, almost certainly secular anthems, intended for extra-liturgical use, including private domestic devotions (as, explicitly, were Weelkes's two contributions to Sir William Leighton's <span class="italic">The Tears or Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soul</span>, 1614, his only sacred pieces printed in his lifetime). There is, nevertheless, clear evidence that some at least of Weelkes's full anthems served in both contexts. In secular anthems he was free to employ a more rhetorical, or affective, style; here he was something of a pioneer&#151;and often at his best, as in the splendid six-voice &#145;Hosanna to the Son of David&#146; and &#145;Gloria in excelsis Deo. Sing, my soul&#146;. Of his full services, that for seven voices is especially impressive; set this noble, monolithic creation alongside the trails of dazzling imagery and heightened expressive states from which the greatest of the early madrigals were assembled, and the breadth of Weelkes's expressive range is impressively displayed, confirming him as one of the most prodigiously gifted of all English Renaissance composers, whose personal decline was one of the great tragedies of English music.<br>
