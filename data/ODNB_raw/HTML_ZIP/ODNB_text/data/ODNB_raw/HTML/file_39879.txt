<span class="headword">Cook, Sir  William Richard Joseph</span>  (1905&#150;1987), <span class="occ">scientist and civil servant</span>, was born on 10 April 1905 in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, the elder son and eldest of three children of John Cook, railway inspector, and his wife, Eva Boobyer. A successful scholar at Trowbridge high school, he went on to Bristol University and graduated BSc in 1925 with first-class honours in mathematics (specializing in applied maths). He took a diploma in education in 1926 and an MSc in 1927. Success as a part-time lecturer almost persuaded him to become a teacher, but he settled for the civil service, and joined the research department at Woolwich arsenal in 1928, as librarian.<br>
<br>After working for a time on the external ballistics of guns, Cook joined the new rocket programme in 1935, and by 1940 had become deputy controller of projectile development, where he was responsible for many successful military applications of rockets. At the end of the Second World War he became first director of a new rocket establishment at Westcott, but uncertainty and disagreement about the future of the work unsettled him so much that in 1947 he moved to become director of physical research at the Admiralty, where, although the field was new to him, he was instrumental in pioneering major advances in underwater warfare technology. He became deputy chief scientific adviser, Ministry of Defence, in 1950, as well as chief of the Royal Naval Scientific Service. In 1954 the government decided to develop thermonuclear weapons and Cook, an ideal choice, was appointed to lead the programme, as deputy director at Aldermaston. The essence of his work was to test the bomb before a possible test ban treaty could be imposed. A crash programme, driven by Cook, culminated in a successful test series based on Christmas Island in 1957. He himself went to the island to play a vital role as directing scientist. Following this demonstration of British thermonuclear capability, he played a leading role in the successful negotiations to re-establish co-operation with the United States. Cook left Aldermaston early in 1958 to become member for engineering and development in the Atomic Energy Authority and took over the newly formed reactor group in 1961. Here he achieved a great deal, resolving problems in the advanced gas-cooled reactor, bringing the fast reactor to full power, and recommending the construction of a heavy-water steam-generating reactor.<br>
<br>Cook returned to the Ministry of Defence in 1964 where, as a deputy chief scientific adviser, he took responsibility for operational requirements and projects. His immediate problem was the disorganization that followed the cancellation of the fighter bomber TSR2. An Anglo-French project for a fighter aircraft quickly failed when the French withdrew, and was replaced by a joint British&#150;German&#150;Italian effort. After much difficult negotiation, in which Cook played a prominent part, the successful Tornado fighter was specified and produced. In 1968 he became chief adviser, projects and research, and set up a number of important international projects intended to reduce defence costs. He also initiated the studies which led eventually to the Chevaline system to improve the defence penetration of the Polaris missile. He retired in 1970 but soon became involved in commercial directorships, which kept him very busy for another fifteen years. Nationally the most important of these was Rolls-Royce, which had gone bankrupt in 1971. He was appointed to chair a committee to decide very quickly whether the RB211 engine should be continued, and it is largely to his credit that the engine eventually became the backbone of Rolls-Royce's civil programme. He was appointed a director when the new government-owned company was set up later in 1971. In addition to his directorships, he continued to chair, very effectively, the nuclear safety committees for another ten years. He was appointed CB in 1951, and KCB in 1970, having been knighted in 1968. He held honorary degrees from Strathclyde (1967) and Bath (1975). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1962.<br>
<br>Cook, known as Bill to his friends and colleagues, was slightly built and always neatly dressed. A man of great charm and ready wit, fond of his pipe and of a Scotch, he was known for his meticulous preparation for meetings, his ability to find and probe the weaknesses in a technical case, and his forceful but good-humoured pressure on all to give of their best. In 1929 he married Grace, daughter of Frederick Arthur Purnell, treasurer for Burton upon Trent council; they had one daughter. They were divorced in 1939, and in the same year he married Gladys, librarian at the Woolwich arsenal department, the daughter of Sydney Edward Allen, postman. They had one son and one daughter. When Gladys's health began to fail he looked after her devotedly. He died on 16 September 1987 in Westminster Hospital, London, following a massive stroke.<br>
