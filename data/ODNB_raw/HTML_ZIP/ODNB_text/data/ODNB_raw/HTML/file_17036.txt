<span class="headword">London,  Henry  of</span> <span class="st"> [Henry  de Loundres]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1228), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin and justiciar of Ireland</span>, was a member of the Blund family of London, one of five sons of Bartholomew Blund, alderman of that city (<i>d</i>. 1201). Although Henry is never called Blund in contemporary records, his presence in witness lists connected with the Blunds as well as his concern for and generosity to various members of the family make the link incontrovertible.<h2>
<a name="LoyalservicetoJohn"></a>Loyal service to John</h2>Henry is occasionally referred to as <i>magister</i> but there is no indication as to where he earned this title. He first appears in the records <i>c</i>.1190 when Hugh de Nonant, bishop of Coventry, instituted him to the church of Mayfield in Staffordshire. He acquired the archdeaconry of Stafford <i>c</i>.1194, presumably again through Nonant's patronage. In 1195 he is found offering a fine of &pound;200 to obtain the goodwill of the king, indicating that he had allied himself with the bishop of Coventry and Count John in the conspiracy against Richard I.<br>
<br>Once John became king, Henry of London's career in the royal administration commenced. He served the king in numerous capacities and has been described as &#145;typical of the <i>curiales</i> operating in a number of areas simultaneously who made Angevin government so effective&#146;  (Turner, 91). He served in the judiciary and acted as an officer of the chamber, supervising the transport of the king's treasure and regulating supplies for the court. He also took part in some important diplomatic missions, including a number of visits to Ireland. In 1204 he was among a party of three sent to Ireland to advise the justiciar Meiler fitz Henry and investigate his charges against William de Burgh. On this visit he also accompanied the justiciar to Connacht to negotiate with Cathal &Oacute; Conchobhair.<br>
<br>Henry's service to the king was amply rewarded and he amassed a collection of benefices, prebends, and titles. Many of the rewards came during the years of the interdict when his continued loyalty to the king, and his efforts to delay public proclamation of John's excommunication, linked him firmly with the side of the state against the church. King John attempted on two occasions to have Henry appointed to an English bishopric but was foiled, first by the monks of Coventry and later by Archbishop Langton who refused to consecrate Henry as bishop of Exeter.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofDublinjusticiarandpapallegate"></a>Archbishop of Dublin, justiciar, and papal legate</h2>In contrast, Henry's election to Dublin in 1212, although undocumented, appears to have provoked no hostility, either in Dublin or Rome. He was confirmed in his new position by Pope Innocent III at some date before March 1213. He was still in England in May 1213, when he was among those who witnessed the king's submission to the papal legate at Dover. However, he left for Ireland shortly afterwards. King John, meanwhile, lost no time in demonstrating that he expected the new archbishop to perform a dual role in Dublin, when in July 1213 he appointed him justiciar of Ireland.<br>
<br>Henry was in Ireland by August 1213 and he spent the next year and a half in his diocese. His first tenure of the office of justiciar spanned the period 1213&#150;15 and it was marked by military and diplomatic successes. The archbishop enjoyed the support of the English barons in Ireland and ensured their loyalty to King John throughout the crisis in England. As justiciar, Henry was intimately concerned with the rebuilding of Dublin Castle as well as supervising the construction of several other castles in strategic parts of the colony. These included Roscrea Castle from which a successful campaign against Muirchertach &Oacute; Briain was mounted. The archbishop left Ireland in May 1215 and was present at Runnymede in June where he was named among the king's councillors and was one of the chief witnesses to <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>.<br>
<br>Henry was relieved of the office of justiciar in July 1215, probably because he was about to set out for Rome. Accompanied by his suffragan bishops of Kildare and Ferns, he attended the Fourth Lateran Council, leaving the affairs of the province in the hands of the bishops of Ossory and Leighlin. There survives no information on the part played by Henry in the affairs of the council, although true to form he did use the occasion to further John's business at the papal court. He spent some of his time in Rome engaged in matters pertaining to the Dublin church, receiving four confirmations from Innocent III and a further three from his successor Honorius III. These included papal confirmations of the incorporation of the diocese of Glendalough into the metropolitan see of Dublin, confirmations of metropolitan rights and privileges, and confirmations of the possessions of the cathedrals of St Patrick's and Holy Trinity.<br>
<br>When Henry returned to Dublin in 1217 he held the post of papal legate to Ireland and he continued in this role for a period of three years. As papal legate he presided over a general synod of Irish clergy. The decrees of this synod have not survived, but according to the annals of Ireland in the chartularies of St Mary's, Dublin, &#145;he ordained many things useful for the condition of the Irish church&#146;  (Gilbert, 2.280). Henry's tenure of the office was controversial and was terminated abruptly in 1220 with the papacy all but asserting that the archbishop had accepted, if not actively supported, royal mandates relating to the exclusion of Irish clerks from ecclesiastical office. It is not clear how large a part Henry played in the formulation of the policy of 1217 which sought to prevent the election of Irishmen to cathedral churches in Ireland. However, he was closely involved with the administration that pursued this discriminatory policy and he did support the claims of the Anglo-Norman candidate in a number of disputed elections.<br>
<br>During this period Henry was justiciar of Ireland in all but name and very little was done by the administration without his counsel and consent. However, strains began to appear between the archbishop and other royal officials in Ireland and disputes flared up around the familiar topics of jurisdictional liberties. In 1218 the archbishop complained that the religious of his diocese were being unlawfully impleaded in lay courts. He also became involved in a dispute with Thomas fitz Adam, the royal forester in Ireland, over the temporal liberties of the Dublin church. His most serious dispute, again over jurisdictional liberties, was with the citizens of Dublin, who made a number of complaints to the king concerning Henry's attempts to obstruct secular justice.<br>
<br>The conflicts never erupted into an outright breach between the crown and the archbishop and in 1221 Henry III underlined his faith in Henry by appointing him justiciar of Ireland for a second time. This second term of office was, however, fraught with difficulty. It coincided with the rebellion of Hugh de Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1242), an event for which Henry appeared to be singularly unprepared. He was apparently forced to purchase a truce when Lacy threatened Dublin in 1224 and shortly after this, in June 1224, he was replaced in office by William (II) Marshal. Henry did not hold formal office in Ireland again and during his last years he was much occupied in attempts to obtain compensation for various expenses he had incurred during his years of service.<br>
<br>Soon after his replacement as justiciar Henry crossed over to England and in September 1225 he was present at the consecration ceremony of the new cathedral of Salisbury. He may also have visited the continent at this time as he had recently purchased an estate in the diocese of Autun in France for the use of the archbishops of Dublin. While his activities in the royal administration, coupled with the temporal responsibilities of his see, left Henry little time for more spiritual matters, he did complete the work of his predecessor John Cumin by raising St Patrick's to cathedral status and instituting the offices of dean, chancellor, treasurer, and precentor. He also continued the building work on the cathedral church of Holy Trinity. During his episcopate most of the nave was completed employing stone and sculptors brought over from England. In 1220 he granted rents to the prior and convent to enable them to construct a new entrance to their church. In return they agreed to celebrate his obit in perpetuity. The archbishop also made gifts to several religious houses in and around Dublin, including the hospital of St John the Baptist and the priory of Gr&acirc;ce Dieu. He also founded <i>c</i>.1216 the hospital of St James at the Steyne.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>Henry of London died on 12 November 1228 in Dublin and was laid to rest the same month in the cathedral church of Holy Trinity. During his lifetime he held the highest offices of church and state in Ireland, as well as functioning as papal legate for three years. The events of his episcopate in Dublin clearly demonstrate the problems faced by a man with divided loyalties and responsibilities. His attempts to dispense simultaneously secular and spiritual justice involved him in frequent disputes which threatened to alienate the goodwill of the crown, while his identification with the discriminatory aims of the royal administration in Ireland caused him to lose the trust of the papacy. Although he demonstrated through his patronage and church-building a practical piety, his career as the second Anglo-Norman archbishop of Dublin, and one of the most active and controversial occupants of that see in the thirteenth century, was marked by his administrative expertise rather than by his spirituality.<br>
