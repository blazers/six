<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rees,  David James <span class="st"> [Dai]</span></span>  (1913&#150;1983), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born on 31 March 1913 in the village of Ffontigari y Barri, Glamorgan, the son of David Evans Rees (<i>d</i>. 1959), greenkeeper at Barry golf club, and his wife, Louisa Alice Trow. He attended St Athan primary school at Gileston, then Jenner Park School in Barry, where he played football and gained a Welsh schools trial. Not until he was twelve did he become dedicated to golf, when his family had moved to Aberd&acirc;r and Dai became a pupil at Aber-nant School.<br>
<br>The young Dai Rees was brought up in a golfing environment, as his father was professional successively at The Leys and Brynhill, both small Welsh clubs. Nevertheless his early golfing education came from a Leys club member, R. J. Middle. At the age of five Rees played a downhill hole of 300 yards in just five strokes, holing his approach shot. In February 1929, aged fifteen, he turned professional, working as assistant to his father, when his entry to the Welsh boys' championship was rejected on the grounds that he had earned money as a caddy.<br>
<br>In 1934 Rees secured an assistantship at Surbiton and in 1935 and 1936 he won the British assistants' championship. Non-selection for the 1935 Ryder cup tempted him to emigrate to South Africa, but he was dissuaded by the lack of tournaments there. In spring 1939 he married Eunice Thomas, about the same time that he moved as professional to Hindhead. He left that club in 1946, feeling that the atmosphere had become rather stuffy and snobbish, and moved to become the professional at South Hertfordshire, Totteridge, where he remained for over twenty years, before turning to golf clinics and journalism. During the Second World War he enlisted in the RAF, hoping to become a pilot, but he was, like many professional sportsmen, selected to be a physical training instructor. Eventually, however, he became a driver, and served in the Middle East.<br>
<br>Rees made his d&eacute;but in the Ryder cup in 1937 when, as the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) match play champion, he was an automatic choice. He made an auspicious start by beating Byron Nelson in the singles. This was the first of a record-breaking ten appearances, three of them as team captain, including the famous match of 1957 at Lindrick, where the British team finally regained the trophy after twenty-four years. He was also non-playing captain in 1967. His Ryder cup singles record of five wins from ten games was strong at a time when the British Isles usually lost. After the Lindrick triumph Rees was voted BBC sports personality of the year and made a CBE in the new year's honours list.<br>
<br>A non-smoker and virtual teetotaller, Rees kept himself fit and believed that strength was important to a golfer. He developed this in his legs by walking and cycling in the hilly terrain of the Welsh countryside as well as, in his teenage years, working during the winter at Aberd&acirc;r golf club loading barrows with rocks, earth, and turf and trundling them for miles along the fairways. He also felt that being Welsh and of small stature gave him the need to prove himself. Never a long hitter, he was a confident putter and a very gritty, competitive match play golfer&#151;something he attributed to an individualistic childhood in which he spent much time on his own. A perfectionist, Rees was often dissatisfied with his own game or with the course, his caddy, the gallery, and any number of extraneous agencies beyond the match in hand. But as he said when asked to consider the difference between Welsh golfers and others, &#145;Remember we are Celtic, and Celts sometimes blow their tops. But you'll never find a Welsh golfer with ulcers!&#146;  (Houghton, 118).<br>
<br>Rees was elected to the executive committee of the PGA in 1946 and served on its trade subcommittee from its inception in 1947. However, by 1950 he had left the executive. Although a supporter of the PGA, he, like many other tournament professionals, felt that the executive was prejudiced towards the interests of the club professional. Rees was among the group who lobbied for an improved tournament structure in the late 1950s. In 1960 he led another challenge to the PGA hierarchy by delivering a players' manifesto that demanded more diversification in its list of sponsors.<br>
<br>Rees's tournament record included victories at both ends of the age spectrum, the assistants' championship in 1935 and the seniors' title in 1966. In between he won the British PGA match play four times (1936, 1938, 1949, and 1950) and lost in the final in 1955, 1967, and 1969, the last when aged fifty-six. The open itself always eluded him, although he finished runner-up to three great golfers: Ben Hogan, in 1953; Peter Thomson, in 1954; and Arnold Palmer, in 1961. In 1959, to the delight of his father, he won his first tournament in Wales, the British closed PGA championship. His last title was the South of England PGA in 1975; in the following year he became an honorary member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. He wrote five books on the game, <span class="italic">Golf my Way</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Dai Rees on Golf</span> (1959), <span class="italic">The Key to Golf</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Golf Today</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">Thirty Years of Championship Golf</span> (1968). He died at Barnet General Hospital, Barnet, on 15 November 1983.<br>
