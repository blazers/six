<span class="headword">Rooke,  Noel</span>  (1881&#150;1953), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was born on 30 December 1881 in Bedford Park, Acton, London, where he lived all his life. His father was Thomas Matthews Rooke (1842&#150;1942), a portrait painter and a member of the Royal Watercolour Society who had worked with Burne-Jones, Sydney Cockerell, and Ruskin, and his mother Leonora Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. Noel Rooke was educated in France, at the Lyc&eacute;e de Chartres, and at the Godolphin School, Hammersmith, and studied art in London at the Slade School of Fine Art (1899&#150;1903) and later at the Central School of Arts and Crafts under W. R. Lethaby and Edward Johnston.<br>
<br>The mid-nineteenth-century explosion in the production of books and magazines ensured that engravers and other artists could not cope with the demand for their work, and, in the hands of commercial engravers, wood-engraving became a purely reproductive medium. In the latter part of the century the introduction of a photographic means of reproduction was the answer to cope with the still growing demand for illustrated reading material. The subsequent &#145;process&#146; print was a speedier but less satisfactory alternative, and the most popular of these processes and perhaps the most unsatisfactory was the half-tone. Rooke became dissatisfied with the photographic reproduction of his drawings, and at some time in 1904, inspired by discussions with Edward Johnston, he began to make wood-engravings that could be printed directly from the block. It was of course a slower method once again, and thus more expensive, so that most books with wood-engravings were produced by private presses until, in the 1930s and 1940s, commercial publishers such as Constable and Dent began to use that process, turning the woodblocks into metal plates. Rooke in turn inspired Eric Gill to start engraving, and between them these two fostered the revival of wood-engraving in Britain. Together they helped reinstate the &#145;white line&#146; technique that Thomas Bewick and William Blake had developed some hundred years earlier. Wood-engraving for book illustration, however, was slow to be recognized as an acceptable art school subject, and it was not until some ten years later that Rooke began to teach it at the Central School, where he had been appointed teacher of illustration in 1905. Though he was not the first to teach the subject (Sydney Lee had started to teach wood-engraving at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in 1904&#150;5), Rooke was certainly responsible for raising the status of wood engraving as an independent and teachable graphic medium  (Selborne, 57).<br>
<br>Rooke was appointed head of the school of book production at the Central School in 1914, and it is as a teacher and as one of the chief originators of the modern movement of wood-engraving that his primary importance lies. He illustrated only a few books himself. He made some brilliant drawings of hands for Edward Johnston's <span class="italic">Writing &amp; Illuminating &amp; Lettering</span> (1905), and he illustrated with watercolours both R. L. Stevenson's <span class="italic">Travels with a Donkey</span> (1909) and his last book, the <span class="italic">Flowers of Marsh and Stream</span> by I. A. Williams, published by King Penguin in 1946. He used simple wood-engravings with large black areas for two books, Rupert Brooke's <span class="italic">The Old Vicarage, Grantchester</span> (1916) and his own <span class="italic">The Nativity: the Birth of Christ from the Gospel According to Saint Luke</span>, which he did for the Golden Cockerel Press in 1925. For thirty years he taught wood-engraving for illustrating and decorating books. Many of his students became eminent engravers and illustrators, among them John Farleigh, Robert Gibbings, Vivien Gribble, Clare Leighton, George Mackley, and Margaret Pilkington, and Rooke was responsible for many of his students receiving commissions from publishers.<br>
<br>In 1920 Rooke had become a founder member of the Society of Wood-Engravers, and in the same year he was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. His <span class="italic">Woodcuts and Wood Engravings</span> (1926) describes the origin and character of the (then) present school of engraving and cutting. On 31 December 1932 he married Celia Mary Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, one of his pupils. He died at the West London Hospital on 5 October 1953.<br>
<br>Rooke's wife, <a name="cosubject_70897"></a><span class="headword">Celia Mary <span class="st"> [Molly]</span> Rooke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>known as </em>Celia Fiennes]</span>  (1902&#150;1998), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and painter</span>, was born on 10 March 1902 at 10 Denbigh Road, Ealing, Middlesex, the daughter of Alberic Arthur Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes (1865&#150;1919), Bank of England clerk, and his wife, Gertrude Theodesia (<i>d</i>. 1923), a daughter of Commander George Francis Colley, naval officer. She was a direct descendant of the traveller Celia Fiennes (1662&#150;1741). From 1924 she trained at the London county council Central School of Arts and Crafts, sharing lodgings with Joyce Clissold. Noel Rooke then found her employment at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society offices, Queen Square, London, and she was largely responsible for the Society's exhibitions in 1928 and 1931. Her output was small, but her wood-engravings included sprightly black silhouette illustrations for the Golden Cockerel Press edition of <span class="italic">The Fables of Aesop</span> (1926). In 1960 she retired to Culworth, Oxfordshire, where she resumed painting and occasionally returned to the family seat, Broughton Castle, as a guide. She died on 17 September 1998 at her home, Amaryllis Cottage, The Green, Culworth. Her adopted daughter Phyllida predeceased her.<br>
