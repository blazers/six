<span class="headword">Richardson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Atkins]</span>,  Anna</span>  (1806&#150;1892), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist and peace campaigner</span>, was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, on 5 January 1806, the fourth of the eight children of Samuel Atkins (1772?&#150;1821), mealman, of Chipping Norton and his wife, Esther (1776&#150;1833), daughter of John Millard, silversmith, of Tewkesbury and his wife, Anna. Her parents were members of the Society of Friends and her mother was a supporter of the anti-slavery campaign. Anna Atkins spent from 1817 to 1819 as a pupil at Ackworth, a leading Quaker school in Yorkshire. On her father's death in 1821, her widowed mother had to bring up a large family in difficult financial circumstances.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1833 Anna Atkins married another Quaker, <a name="cosubject_50726"></a><span class="headword">Henry Richardson</span>  (1806&#150;1885)<span class="occ"></span>, whom she had met at Ackworth (where Henry was a pupil from 1818 to 1820). Born on 18 September 1806, he was the third of the seven children of George Richardson (1773&#150;1862) of Newcastle upon Tyne, a grocer, philanthropist, reformer, and travelling minister in the Society of Friends, and his wife, Eleanor (1778&#150;1846), daughter of John and Rachel Watson, also of Newcastle. Henry and Anna Richardson settled in Newcastle and had a long and happy marriage, although they had no children, and they devoted their energies to philanthropic and reform activities in the town. Henry Richardson took over his father's grocery shop, but retired from the business in 1858. He became an elder in the Society of Friends, and he was the founder of the Boys' ragged school, superintendent of the Friends' Sabbath School, leader of the Newcastle Bible Society, editor of the periodical the <span class="italic">Peace Advocate</span> (1843&#150;51), and an active member of Newcastle Peace Society.<br>
<br>Anna Richardson was even more prominent as an activist than her husband. During the 1840s and 1850s she was the leader of the British free produce movement, an arm of the anti-slavery campaign which aimed to discourage the use in Britain of American slave-grown cotton. In 1846 she founded the Newcastle Ladies' Free Produce Association, and issued a circular encouraging women nationwide to form similar groups. In 1850 she persuaded the American former slave Revd Henry Highland Garnet to come to Britain to promote the cause; as a result, about twenty-six free labour associations were rapidly formed, progress that was recorded in <span class="italic">The Slave</span>, a periodical promoting the free produce movement which she edited between 1851 and 1854. She was recognized by the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society as the national co-ordinator of the free produce movement. She also promoted the anti-slavery cause by assisting her sister-in-law, Ellen Richardson, in raising funds to purchase the freedom of the African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and by compiling monthly &#145;Illustrations of American slavery&#146;, which she distributed free to newspaper editors throughout Britain from 1847 onwards.<br>
<br>Anna Richardson's promotion of the free produce movement was closely linked to her second major preoccupation: the peace movement. Anna and Henry Richardson both attended the 1849 Paris Peace Congress, and between 1844 and 1857 Anna edited the <span class="italic">Olive Leaf</span>, a peace magazine for children. She belonged to the network of Ladies' Olive Leaf circles, which were linked to the League of Universal Brotherhood. The league had been founded by an American, Elihu Burritt, who came to live in Britain in 1846, and it combined promotion of international peace with support for the free labour movement.<br>
<br>Anna Richardson was also involved in a wide variety of other philanthropic and reform activities in Newcastle. She was secretary and district visitor for the Ladies' Branch Bible Society and set up a Bible women's mission to spread religious knowledge to working-class homes, and she was an active member of the Society of Friends. In 1834, at the suggestion of Elizabeth Fry, she became a visitor of Newcastle prison. She became a teetotaller, and she and her husband established temperance refreshment rooms in 1853. Anna was also involved in aid to European immigrants into Britain: in 1839 she produced a book to raise funds in support of Lutheran refugees from Prussia.<br>
<br>Henry Richardson suffered from poor health from 1840 onwards, but lived to the age of seventy-eight, dying on 24 April 1885 at their home, 116 Park Road. He was buried on 28 April at Elswick general cemetery, Newcastle. Anna Richardson died on 27 March 1892 at 116 Park Road, and was buried on 30 March, also in Elswick cemetery. Surviving portraits show a large-featured woman, neatly attired and wearing a Quaker bonnet. She was clearly a serious and religious woman, with a lifelong commitment to philanthropy and reform, and considerable organizational abilities and leadership skills.<br>
