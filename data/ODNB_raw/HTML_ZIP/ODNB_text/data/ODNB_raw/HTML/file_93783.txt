<span class="headword">Tanner,  John Benedict Ian</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">museum director</span>, was born John Ian Tanner on 2 January 1927 at 54 Stockwell Green, London, the son of Arthur William Tanner (1900&#150;1969), motor fitter, of Salisbury, and Ina Dorothy Mabel Wibberley (1897&#150;1986), elder daughter of Henry Maundrell Manners, also of Salisbury. After St Martin's Primary School, Salisbury, he attended Poole grammar school from 1938 to 1940. Having completed his formal schooling by the age of fourteen, he continued his self-education while working voluntarily in the Reading public library service. Gifted with an almost photographic memory, he read voraciously. In January 1943 he became a temporary library assistant at Reading. In 1945 he was temporarily conscripted to work as a &#145;Bevin boy&#146; at Eastwood colliery, Nottinghamshire. He then returned to Reading as a library assistant. After passing the Library Association's preliminary, entrance, and registration examinations (for which he took a year's unpaid study leave) he moved in October 1949 to Kensington Central Library, where he displayed unusual skill in presenting the art collection of its offshoot, Leighton House Museum. He became an associate of the Library Association in 1952. From 1940 until 1954 his successive homes were at Tilehurst, near Reading, except for his brief sojourn in Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>An early interest in aviation led Tanner to move from Kensington to the Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, where he was librarian and tutor in English from 1953 to 1963. He married on 18 June 1954 April Rothery (<i>b</i>. 1931), eldest daughter of Geoffrey Rothery, wool manufacturer, and a colleague from his Kensington days. After their marriage they lived at Bloxholm, near Sleaford, for nine years. Tanner's achievement in compiling a register of Cranwell graduates gained him in 1960 the fellowship of the Library Association. His friendship with Vivian de Sola Pinto inspired him to write two Nottingham theses of a theological nature (an MA in 1961, a PhD in 1965). During his last four years at Cranwell his extraordinary versatility found further expression in Nottingham University extramural classes on art history, for example on Tintoretto.<br>
<br>In 1962 the Air Force council conceived the idea of creating a museum for the Royal Air Force along the lines of the National Army Museum. Tanner submitted a practical action plan to Sir Dermot Boyle's working party. At Cranwell, from 1958 onwards, he had assembled an admired museum of memorabilia; his gift for museum display and his fund-raising skills qualified him to lay the foundations of the Royal Air Force Museum. Appointed its director early in 1963, he built up the museum in the years that followed. It was a success that won him the abiding loyalty and admiration of his staff but that was achieved at huge cost to himself. After the breakdown of his marriage in 1967 he lived on at 57 Drayton Gardens, Chelsea, in a flat bought six years previously. The severe heart attack he suffered on 9 December 1970 was followed by other illnesses. On 21 June 1972 he and April Tanner were divorced.<br>
<br>The Royal Air Force Museum, officially opened by the queen at the former Hendon airfield in November 1972, covered the history of air fighting, flying training, maritime operations, air transport, and air bombardment. Tanner went on to open the Battle of Britain Museum in 1978 and the Bomber Command Museum in 1983 (both on the Hendon site); in 1979 the Royal Air Force Aerospace Museum at Cosford, near Shifnal in Shropshire, was also fully opened to the public. He also set up and maintained a reserve collection and restoration centre at Cardington in Bedfordshire. Although a civil servant, he, together with his trustees, was required to raise all the capital needed to build his projects. He also, sometimes with buccaneering spirit, had to negotiate the labyrinthine ways of the civil service. He retired from the directorship of all four museums in 1988, having been made a CBE nine years previously.<br>
<br>Tanner's interests were not confined to aviation history. A keen genealogist and heraldist, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, he was an authority on the British and Irish pedigrees of American knights of Malta. In addition to receiving other honours he was made a knight of the order of St John of Jerusalem in 1978 and, from 1978 to 1984, was its joint (junior) deputy director of ceremonies. Honorary archivist of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1980 to 1996, he set in train the cataloguing of its archives, for two years at his own expense. At that college he was a senior research fellow in English from 1982 to 1996 and remained a supernumerary fellow from 1996 until his death. In 1986 he was also a visiting fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge. On 20 April 1991 he married a fellow genealogist, Andrea Isobel Duncan (<i>b</i>. 1956), daughter of William Duncan, engineer. She shared his antiquarian interests, and their happy and devoted union drew him into the Roman Catholic church. He adopted the additional name of Benedict on being formally received into the church on 8 July 1993.<br>
<br>An art collector, owner of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, lover of France, and keen amateur actor while at Reading, Tanner could discourse with equal authority and brilliance on opera, the fine arts, literature, cricket, food, wine, or the history of the Christian church, which, like Oxford University, fascinated him throughout his adult life. Besides his <span class="italic">List of Cranwell Graduates</span> he was the author of various books on genealogy and aviation history. He liked to say that he tried to write his history &#145;three-dimensionally&#146;  (personal knowledge). Not technical but a Romantic in outlook, he had a genius for translating dreams into reality. To him nothing seemed truly impossible. Employing his huge social skills and talents of persuasiveness upon a wide range of contacts, he acquired for Hendon some outstanding aircraft, including a Bl&eacute;riot XI monoplane, biplanes of the early twentieth century, an Avro Lancaster bomber, the only surviving Supermarine Stranraer general reconnaissance flying-boat, and the wooden hull of the only surviving Supermarine Southampton. The four museums&#151;essentially one, employing at least 160 staff&#151;that he brought into being were by the time of his retirement among the finest museums of their kind in the world. Having been in failing health for some five years, he was profoundly shaken by the death of his only child, Sarah-Jane (1958&#150;2004), nine weeks before his own. He died of a heart attack at his home, Flat 1, 57 Drayton Gardens, Chelsea, London, on the morning of 18 May 2004. He was survived by his second wife, Andrea. After a funeral service at the London Oratory he was buried on 27 May at Brompton cemetery.<br>
