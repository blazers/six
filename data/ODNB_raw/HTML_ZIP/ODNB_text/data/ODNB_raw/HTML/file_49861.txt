<span class="headword">Marshe,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1516&#150;1579), <span class="occ">mercer and merchant</span>, was either the eldest son of Walter Marshe of London and his wife, Eleanor, or of John Marshe his namesake, with whom he is sometimes confused, who died in 1565 or 1566. He was a lawyer by training, and in 1536 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. As a young man he may also have been a sewer in the chamber of Henry VIII, a position either he or his namesake held by 1543. In that year he married Alice, the daughter and heir of William Gresham, and a cousin of Thomas Gresham, with whom he had at least three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>During the 1560s and 1570s Marshe became one of the most prominent and well-connected merchants in London. His main interest in overseas trade was in the export of wool and cloth to Flanders and northern France. He was also a shipowner and occasional moneylender. By 1559 he was a merchant of the staple, and served as one of its constables in 1561&#150;2. He was a founder member of the Russia Company in 1555 and a leading figure in the Company of Merchant Adventurers. He served as governor of the company from 1555 to 1556, and for much of the period from 1559 to 1572. He was a warden in the Mercers' Company from 1558 to 1559 and from 1565 to 1566. Though he did not trade with Spain, he played a leading role in the establishment of the Spanish Company in 1577, claiming to have been the &#145;first mover&#146; behind its incorporation  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1566&#150;79</i>, <i>addenda</i>, 505).<br>
<br>As governor of the Merchant Adventurers, Marshe was determined to protect the privileges of the company against the threat of interloping. He was a key figure in the complex international crisis of 1563 and 1564 when trade was severely disrupted by an embargo on English wool and cloth in the Netherlands. His resolute leadership, and his support for government plans to move the Merchant Adventurers' mart from Antwerp to Emden, enabled the company to ride out the crisis. His influence with Sir William Cecil was instrumental in the issue of a new charter in 1564 which regularized the move to Emden, though the company returned to Antwerp in 1565.<br>
<br>In addition to these commercial positions, Marshe held a number of important posts in London. As common sergeant from 1547 to 1563 he was responsible for much of the City's legal business. After retiring from that office in 1563 he became a judge in the sheriff's court. He served as an under-sheriff in Middlesex from 1545 to 1546 and from 1563 to 1566. He was on the commission of the peace for Middlesex from 1547 to 1554, and during 1562 and 1564. His experience enabled him to pursue a long and active parliamentary career; he may have sat as MP for Reading in 1547, though it is possible that this refers to his namesake. He was MP for London in 1553, 1554, 1558, 1559, 1563, 1571, and 1572. In 1555 he sat for Old Sarum. His strong protestant convictions led him to oppose Catholicism in the parliaments of Mary's reign. During the Elizabethan parliaments in which he sat, Marshe used his influence to support mercantile and corporate interests in London. He was put in charge of a variety of bills in 1559 and 1563, and was appointed to serve on a wide range of committees in 1566, 1571, 1572, and 1576, including the committee to examine Peter Wentworth in February 1576. During 1572 he made speeches on subjects including the Commons' right to freedom of speech; Mary Queen of Scots, against whom he spoke on 9 June; the bill dealing with the export of leather; and the bill for dyeing cloth. He whole-heartedly opposed the last measure, particularly as the proposed restriction on the export of undyed cloth struck at the commercial privileges of the Merchant Adventurers.<br>
<br>Marshe was one of a small group of merchants who fostered the connection between the court and the City. He was close to Cecil, whom he provided with valuable diplomatic information when he was overseas on company business in 1559, 1565, 1568, and 1570. It was probably at Cecil's prompting that he organized the abduction of Dr John Story from the Netherlands in 1570, on the grounds that he was treasonably conspiring against the queen. Through Cecil's influence he was appointed to numerous commissions dealing with a wide range of matters. He was also involved in handling the commercial problems arising from the Anglo-Spanish crisis from 1568 to 1573.<br>
<br>Although he was not among the wealthiest &eacute;lite of merchants in London, Marshe was comfortably off. He owned land in Northamptonshire, including the manors of Bozeat and Sywell. In 1571, 1574, and 1576 he was awarded grants of concealed lands. A capable, trustworthy, and discreet man of business, he was acknowledged by Walsingham as &#145;a great favourer of the common cause to the utmost of his power&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1577&#150;8</i>, 609). He died in London in 1579, leaving Bozeat to his eldest son, William, and Sywell to his son-in-law, Anthony Jenkinson, the pioneer of English trade with Persia. John Stow records that a monument to him was placed in the parish church of St Michael in Wood Street, where he was buried, and the advowson of which he had purchased from Sir Thomas Gresham in 1565.<br>
