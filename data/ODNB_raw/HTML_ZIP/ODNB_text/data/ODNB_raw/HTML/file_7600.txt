<span class="headword">Dickens,  Charles Culliford Boz <span class="st"> [Charley]</span></span>  (1837&#150;1896), <span class="occ">magazine editor and compiler of guidebooks</span>, was born on 6 January 1837 at 15 Furnival's Inn, London, the eldest of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7599/', "Charles John Huffam Dickens (1812&#150;1870)")</script>, the novelist, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hogarth (1816&#150;1879). Charley, as he was known, received his string of names as a result of an accident at the baptism&#151;Culliford was the maiden surname of Dickens's grandmother, but Boz was added by his grandfather John Dickens, who shouted it out after the baby's godfather had said the officially chosen names.<br>
<br>Charley Dickens's education was sponsored by Angela Burdett-Coutts, with whom his father worked on several philanthropic projects, and who took an interest in his young son. He was sent to King's College School, and from there to Eton College, where his father reported that &#145;Charley &hellip; who has already distinguished himself like a Brick, at Eton&#151;got a prize&#151;been declared at the head of his division, and floored all the boys therein&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.71). But to Burdett-Coutts he confessed some misgivings about the young boy's character: &#145;all he wants, is a habit of perseverance. With that, he could do any thing. He wants it as a fixed purpose and habit of his nature&#146;  (ibid., 6.467). In 1853 Charley Dickens visited Leipzig to learn German, and in 1854, as he vacillated about his career choices, Dickens's reservations again came to the fore. These were expressed in a letter which also perfectly illustrates the particular burden upon Charley as Dickens's eldest son and namesake: &#145;I think he has less fixed purpose and energy than I could have supposed possible in my son. He is not aspiring, or imaginative in his own behalf &hellip; he inherits from his mother &hellip; an indescribable lassitude of character&#151;a very serious thing in a man&#146;  (ibid., 7.245).<br>
<br>In 1855 Charley Dickens returned to England to a post in Barings Bank, but it was not to his taste. During his four years at the bank he became involved in his parents' messy separation, and in 1859 agreed with his father that, as eldest son, he would live with his mother. In 1860, partly financed by Burdett-Coutts, he embarked upon a trip to China, also visiting Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Japan, aiming to set up as a tea merchant. It is likely that Dickens based <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> character Herbert Pocket, in the original manuscript a merchant with interests in China, partially upon his son. &#145;It is possible too that Herbert's &#147;conquered languor&#148;, despite his usually cheerful spirits and briskness, which Pip feels denotes a lack of natural strength, owes something to Dickens's critical assessment of his own son&#146;  (Caldwell, xxvii).<br>
<br>On 18 August 1861, having returned to England, Charley Dickens established a paper-making company with his future brother-in-law, Frederick Moule Evans. He married Elizabeth Matilda Moule (Bessie) Evans (<i>d</i>. 1907) on 19 November 1861, at St Mark's, Regent's Park, London. His father, who had had an unresolvable quarrel with Bessie's father, F. M. Evans, did not attend the wedding, and he also warned his son against entering into a business that had Evans as a major shareholder, and Evans's son as a director. One year later Charley and Bessie Dickens had their first of eight children.<br>
<br>After seven years the printing partnership failed, and Charley Dickens was made bankrupt. His father gave him a job working on his periodical <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> late in 1868, and in 1869, when W. H. Wills's ill health prevented him from carrying on as sub-editor for the journal, Charley Dickens took over, being installed officially in the post in May 1870. Dickens thought he &#145;evince[d] considerable aptitude in sub-editing work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 12.378), although he had earlier stated that Charley had &#145;no literary bent or taste&#146;  (ibid., 8.119). By a codicil to his will on 2 June 1870 his father bequeathed to him his share and interest in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>. Charley argued with Wills about salary and duties, and they agreed in January 1871 to dissolve the partnership, with Charley paying Wills &pound;500 for his interest, leaving Charley Dickens as the sole proprietor and editor of the periodical. Sales of the weekly journal steadily fell during Charley's editorship; he proved unable to attract the same quality of serial novels that his father had commissioned through his literary contacts and influence. The character of the journal also changed, and &#145;might &hellip; be best expressed as a decline from an important literary force to a &#147;woman's magazine&#148;&#146;  (Casey, 91). It remained successful enough, however, for Charley Dickens to continue as editor and proprietor, until he decided to terminate its publication in 1893. In addition to his editorial work Charley Dickens became the chief partner in the printing firm of Dickens and Evans, with whom he had some success as the author of several popular guidebooks. <span class="italic">Dickens's Dictionary of London</span> (1879) ran into fourteen editions, and was followed by similar guides to Paris (1882), Oxford (1884), Cambridge (1884), and the Thames (1887), all running into multiple editions.<br>
<br>Soon after his father's death Charley Dickens had bought the family home, Gad's Hill Place, in Kent, much to the irritation of his aunt Georgina Hogarth and other members of the Dickens family, who had hoped to purchase it for the estate. He found it impossible to let, however, and so was forced to sell it to another party in 1879. He further angered his formidable aunt through a disagreement over the proposed sale and exhibition of the &#145;Swiss chalet&#146;, a small outbuilding of Gad's Hill in which his father had spent his last day. As a result of the argument Georgina had Charley removed as executor of her will, and reduced her legacies to his daughters.<br>
<br>In 1887 Charley Dickens made a tour of the United States, giving readings from his father's books: &#145;He was an excellent reader and reciter, and he inherited to the full the gift of the great novelist as an after-dinner orator&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Upon his return to England he left his printing business, and became a reader with Macmillan &amp; Co. He oversaw a new edition of his father's works for the firm (1892&#150;3), and wrote bio-bibliographical introductions for the volumes. Charley Dickens died of heart disease on 20 July 1896 at his home, 43 Fairholme Road, Fulham, London. He was buried three days later in Mortlake cemetery. He was survived by his wife and seven children.<br>
