<span class="headword">Hayter, Sir  William Goodenough</span>, first baronet  (1792&#150;1878), <span class="occ">politician and barrister</span>, youngest son of John Hayter, and his wife, Grace, daughter of Stephen Goodenough of Codford, Wiltshire, was born at Winterbourne Stoke, Wiltshire, on 28 January 1792. He entered Winchester College in 1804 and matriculated on 24 October 1810 from Trinity College, Oxford, where he took his BA in 1814. On being called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 23 November 1819, he became an equity draftsman and conveyancer, and attended the Wiltshire sessions, but retired from practice on being made a QC on 21 February 1839; he was, however, bencher of his inn on 15 April 1839, and treasurer in 1853. On 18 August 1832 he married Anne (1806/7&#150;1889), eldest daughter of William Pulsford of Linslade.<br>
<br>On 24 July 1837 Hayter was returned as a Liberal to the House of Commons as one of the members for Wells, and sat for that constituency until 6 July 1865. From 30 December 1847 to 30 May 1849 he was judge-advocate-general. At the latter date he became financial secretary to the Treasury, and in July 1850 was appointed parliamentary and patronage secretary, a post which he held until March 1852, and again from December 1852 to March 1858. Hayter was an effective whip, especially during the minority tory government of 1852 and the early years of the subsequent Aberdeen coalition. He failed to prevent the collapse of the coalition in 1855, and probably preferred working for Palmerston, Aberdeen's successor as prime minister. On 11 February 1848 he was sworn of the privy council. After his retirement, on 19 April 1858, he was created a baronet, and on 27 February 1861, to commemorate his record as whip, he was presented by Lord Palmerston and 365 members of the House of Commons with a service of plate at a banquet in Willis's Rooms (<span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, 9 March 1861, with view of the testimonial).<br>
<br>Hayter was a successful farmer, his farm, Lindsay, near Leighton, Buckinghamshire, being a byword for economy and profitable management. He was one of the council of the Agricultural Society from its commencement in 1838. He voted with C. P. Villiers in 1839 for the repeal of the corn laws, and was present at all the divisions in favour of free trade. He was not a frequent speaker, but took part in debates on matters within his knowledge. In Lord Denman's inquiry into the management of the woods and forests he was a member of the committee, and was chairman of the committee on Feargus O'Connor's land scheme. During 1878 he fell into a depressed state of mind, and on 26 December was found drowned in a small lake in the grounds of his residence, South Hill Park, Easthampstead, Berkshire. He was buried at Easthampstead on 2 January 1879. He was survived by his wife who died in London on 2 June 1889.<br>
<br>Hayter was succeeded by his only son, <a name="cosubject_59927"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Divett Hayter</span>, Baron Haversham  (1835&#150;1917), <span class="occ">politician</span>, who was born on 9 August 1835. After Eton College and Brasenose College, Oxford, Arthur Hayter joined the Grenadier Guards. He was Liberal MP for Wells (1865&#150;8), for Bath (1873&#150;85), and for Walsall (1893&#150;95). Hayter was a reliable Liberal. After succeeding his father as second baronet in 1878, he was a junior whip from 1880 to 1882 and was financial secretary to the War Office from 1882 to 1885. He chaired the public accounts committee from 1901 to 1905 and was created Baron Haversham in January 1906. In 1866 he married Henrietta <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hope. They had no children and his titles became extinct when he died on 10 May 1917.<br>
