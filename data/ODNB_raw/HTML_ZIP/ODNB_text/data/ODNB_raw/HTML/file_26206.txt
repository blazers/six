<span class="headword">Stafford,  Hugh</span>, second earl of Stafford  (<em>c.</em>1342&#150;1386), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the second son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26211/', "Ralph Stafford, first earl of Stafford (d. 1372)")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or before 1348), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37134/', "Hugh Audley, earl of Gloucester (d. 1347)")</script>, and Margaret, the widow of Edward II's favourite, Piers Gaveston. The early death without children of his elder brother, Ralph, in or just before 1347, came as a profound blow to the family, since he had been married to one of the two daughters and coheirs of the influential English commander, Henry of Grosmont, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1361), and had thus stood to gain control of half the duchy. Hugh's own marriage, about 1350, to Philippa, daughter of another of his father's comrades-in-arms, Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1369), and Katherine, daughter of Roger Mortimer, first earl of March, was less of a dynastic coup, since it added nothing to the rapidly expanding Stafford estates. Even so, he could still hope to inherit from his parents property spread between Norfolk and the Welsh marches worth about &pound;2700 a year, together with an annual fee of 1000 marks from the crown to support his title.<br>
<br>Stafford had followed his father to France by 1359, when he joined the retinue of Edward, the Black Prince. He took part in the campaign which led, in May 1360, to the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny, then spent time in Gascony with the prince, and eventually travelled with him to northern Spain in support of Pedro the Cruel, king of Castile. If not actually present at the battle of N&aacute;jera in 1367, he was certainly involved in skirmishes during the march beforehand. After many years of active service overseas under the prince's banner he returned home to be summoned to parliament, first as Lord Stafford in January 1371, and then, after his father's death, as the second earl. Although he never came to play a decisive role in English political life, he exercised considerable influence during Edward III's troubled last years. Having sat on a number of royal commissions, he briefly campaigned in France in 1373 and in Brittany two years later, under the less than distinguished command of, respectively, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and the earl of Cambridge. Shortly afterwards he became a knight of the Garter. Criticism of the king's advisers, their financial incompetence, and the mismanagement of the war effort came to a head in the Good Parliament of 1376. Despite his close connection with the court party, Earl Hugh managed to escape personal censure. He was, indeed, nominated to serve on the committee of peers with whom the Commons regularly conferred, and, significantly, was endorsed by the rebellious lower house as a suitable member of the new &#145;continual council&#146; of state. He remained in office after Richard II's accession in June 1377, and took part, as carver of the king's bread and meat, in the ceremonies following the coronation. Another, less attractive, side of his character emerges at this time, as he lost some of the respect he had previously commanded from the Commons. His attempt in 1378 to censure the popular London MP, John Philipot, for mobilizing a fleet to defend merchant shipping without conciliar approval, ended in humiliation, and he himself was taken to task for arrogance and empty bombast. According to one chronicler, his temper again defeated him at this time: the allegation that he murdered one John Hawkesley in the choir of Westminster Abbey is not, however, otherwise widely reported.<br>
<br>Stafford continued to act as a royal commissioner, notably with regard to Scottish affairs and coastal defence. Some idea of his wealth may be gained from his outlay for the year 1383&#150;4: with a net income of &pound;2120 at his disposal, he spent &pound;870 on running his household, &pound;292 on luxury goods supplied by London merchants, almost &pound;200 on buying up property in the midlands, and over &pound;100 on purchases for his eldest son, Ralph. The young man was a particular favourite of Richard II, whose companion he had been as a boy, and in July 1384 the king gave him and the earl a licence to hunt in royal parks. Both father and son joined the expedition which Richard led against the Scots in the following May, but, as the army reached York, Ralph was killed by the king's half-brother, Sir John Holland, in revenge for the death of one of his own retainers. &#145;Almost distracted by his emotions as a father&#146;  (Hector and Harvey, 123) Earl Hugh threatened to return home unless justice was done. Richard agreed, but in February 1386 a grand ceremony of reconciliation took place at Windsor. Although he made a public show of forgiveness, it was with profound rancour as well as grief that Hugh embarked on a series of pilgrimages. After visiting Walsingham, in April 1386 (by which date his wife had died), Stafford set sail for Jerusalem, but got no further than the island of Rhodes where he died, in the hospital of the knights of St John, after a short illness, in late September or early October.<br>
<br>Earl Hugh's bones were transported to Stone Priory, Staffordshire, for burial beside his wife and ancestors as he had wished. His tomb, which was made in Nottingham, cost almost &pound;13, but the interment itself was a subdued affair, again in accordance with his will. He left four sons, three of whom inherited the earldom in rapid succession. The fourth was created Lord Bourchier in 1411 and died childless nine years later. Each of his three daughters married into the upper ranks of the peerage: Katherine had been betrothed to Michael de la Pole, future earl of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1415), in Stafford's lifetime; Margaret married Ralph, Lord Neville, future earl of Westmorland (<i>d</i>. 1425); and Joan was destined, at a cost of 4000 marks to the Stafford family, to end their feud with the Hollands by becoming the wife of Thomas Holland, earl of Kent (<i>d</i>. 1399), the nephew of her brother's murderer.<br>
