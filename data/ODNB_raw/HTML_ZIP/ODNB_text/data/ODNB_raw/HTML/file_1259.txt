<span class="headword">Bampfield,  Joseph</span>  (1622&#150;1685), <span class="occ">army officer and spy</span>, was probably born in Devon, one of a family long established in the west country, but his parentage and early life are obscure. There is no validity for the earl of Clarendon's later statement that he was an Irishman, although he may have been educated at Trinity College, Dublin, in the 1630s. He began his military career aged seventeen in 1639 as an ensign in Lord Astley's regiment in the expedition against the Scots known as the first bishops' war. In the second bishops' war he was a lieutenant and then captain in the regiment of Colonel Wentworth. By September 1642 he was a major in the royalist army commanded by the marquess of Hertford and fought at Yeovil on 7 September 1642, when he was taken prisoner. He had escaped by December 1642 and, still only nineteen, was commissioned a colonel by Charles I by 16 January 1643. About this time, certainly by 1 February 1643, he married Catherine (1622&#150;1657), daughter of John Sydenham of Brympton, Somerset. The couple were estranged by 1645&#150;1646 and had no children. Bampfield was involved in the royalist occupation of Malmesbury in April 1643 and played a prominent role in the sieges of Exeter and Dartmouth. Late in October 1643 he was part of Lord Hopton's army and with Sir Edward Ford was given the task of recapturing Arundel Castle in December. Having been given command of the castle Bampfield found himself besieged by Sir William Waller's forces and surrendered on 6 January 1644, attracting some criticism from the royalist side. He was again taken prisoner and remained in the Tower for some five months, until released on parole, when he immediately absconded to Oxford and rejoined the king's forces in the west. In autumn 1644 he was in action at Lyme and Taunton, but after a disorderly retreat from Chard in December 1644 he was arrested and then dismissed from service by Hopton.<br>
<br>In the course of the following year, however, Bampfield gained the confidence of Charles I, who employed him as a courier, occasional adviser, and intelligence agent from late 1645 until access to the king's person was halted in 1648. He appears to have followed a pro-presbyterian line in his advice to the monarch. His greatest adventure of the latter years of the second civil war was contriving the escape of James, duke of York, from parliamentary hands in April 1648. Overcoming James's own scruples Bampfield engineered an escape from London on 20&#150;21 April with the prince disguised in woman's clothes. The pair were assisted in the venture by Anne Murray (1623&#150;1699) and landed at Zeeland on 22 April 1648. Bampfield had met Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11934/', "Halkett, Anne")</script>] in late 1647 or early 1648 and they had a lengthy affair from 1648 to 1653, although the details of their relationship remain obscure. In 1648 Bampfield was advised that his wife, whom he had not seen for some time, was dead and it is possible that he and Anne were privately married, bigamously, in Bampfield's case, in the Netherlands in winter 1648&#150;9. Their relationship came to an end in March 1653 when Anne finally accepted that Bampfield's wife was still living.<br>
<br>Despite Bampfield's success in rescuing James his dabbling in court politics for the presbyterian interest damaged his standing at the exiled court and his attempts to make use of the duke of York's authority to improvise a naval expedition in summer 1648 to save the king were a failure. His subsequent comments that the king's children should have taken a lead in rescuing their father permanently lost him the friendship of the prince of Wales and he returned to England.<br>
<br>In the months following the death of Charles I Bampfield was in hiding in London, often in the company of Anne Murray. Arrested in December 1649 he was imprisoned in the Gatehouse but was able to escape with the help of friends that same month and fled to the Netherlands. On the boat over he was recognized by Sir Henry Newton, Anne's brother-in-law, and challenged to a duel for the offence he had caused the family by maintaining this liaison. Bampfield wounded Newton and was once more forced into hiding. Although Charles II refused to see him Bampfield followed him to Scotland in summer 1650 where he attempted to redeem himself by being very active in royal affairs, but &#145;was frequently agitated betwixt hope and despair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bampfield's Apology</span>, 81).<br>
<br>Charles II received Bampfield at Paris in 1653, but the king's continued dislike of him was obvious and consequently, in spring or summer 1654, he entered the service of John Thurloe as an agent of the protectorate. He provided intelligence about the exiled court, conspiracies, and foreign affairs in the late 1650s, frequently returning to England, in the early years of his employment, to receive instruction from Thurloe. An attempt to enter military service again by raising a regiment of English and Scots troops to fight in the French army failed when Oliver Cromwell became suspicious of his motives, imprisoned him in March 1657 and then exiled him from Britain. He remained abroad until Cromwell's death in 1658, continuing to write intelligence reports for Thurloe, although without much encouragement. Shortly before the restoration of the king he returned to England, hoping that he would be included in the general pardon given out at Breda, but Charles II remained hostile and by May 1660 Bampfield was in the Tower.<br>
<br>Released on 30 July 1661 Bampfield left England for the Netherlands. He settled in Middelburg in Zeeland from 1661 to spring 1665, attending the English reformed church there and claiming he had been exiled because of his nonconformity. In October 1662 he was encouraged to act as an agent for the government of Charles II by Sir Allen Apsley and Sir Henry Bennet and for nearly two years he spied on the dissenters and other republican rebels located in the United Provinces and also supplied foreign intelligence to the British. His correspondence at this time was littered with pleas for money and pitiful expressions over his miserable condition, but his hopes for a pardon from Charles II and a return to good fortune remained unfulfilled. In spring 1664 he attracted the attention of John de Witt, the grand pensionary. Although warned that Bampfield had a reputation as a notorious rogue de Witt was intrigued by his &#145;very through knowledge of the Court of England and of our present disturbances&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bampfield's Apology</span>, 192) and recruited him in March 1665 as an agent for the Dutch government. Bampfield identified English spies in the Netherlands, reported on political opposition, and proffered advice, whether wanted or not, to de Witt on the current political situation in Europe. He became entangled in numerous conspiratorial schemes and had convoluted associations with William Scot, son of Thomas Scot the regicide, and Aphra Behn in 1665&#150;6.<br>
<br>Bampfield volunteered for naval service in 1665 and by mid-October he had been given a major's commission to organize a troop of cavalry. The English government took revenge by attainting Bampfield for high treason in 1665, effectively preventing him from ever returning to England. For the remainder of the 1660s de Witt employed Bampfield in political negotiations relating to the role of the prince of Orange and as a military adviser. Despite his apparent value, de Witt kept Bampfield short of money and he had to wait until 19 March 1671 to become a colonel. With the approach of war he was sent to Cologne to recruit troops, returning to the Netherlands in February 1672 while his men were stationed in garrisons along the Rhine valley. In spring 1672 Bampfield was attached to the army assembling at Ijssel under the prince of Orange. During a French offensive at Zwolle, Bampfield apparently tried to rouse the local populace, but the town surrendered and Bampfield was blamed. His career in the Dutch army was finally ruined when his post at Ameide, south of the River Lek, was overrun in a French attack on 27 November. Rumours that he had betrayed the post to the French did not help his cause, nor did his former association with de Witt. Although Bampfield was exonerated by two courts martial and restored to his rank, William of Orange intervened and he was dismissed from the army.<br>
<br>Bampfield retired to Bergum in Friesland in 1674. At the end of September 1679 he moved to Leeuwarden. When in 1682 the earl of Argyll settled in Friesland, having fled England after involvement in treasonable activities, Bampfield once more became a potential source of intelligence to the English government and a somewhat desultory correspondence was carried on with the secretary of state, Sir Leoline Jenkins, from 1682 to 1684. In 1685 Bampfield published a pamphlet justifying his career, notably leaving out his activities as a spy. In it he noted that he had for &#145;a long time considered death &hellip; as the only end of my calamities which I could reasonably hope for and my most sure azile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bampfield's Apology</span>, 37). He died in Leeuwarden in 1685 and was buried in the Netherlands.<br>
