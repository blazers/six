<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dreyer,  John Louis Emil</span>  (1852&#150;1926), <span class="occ">astronomer and historian of astronomy</span>, was born at Copenhagen on 13 February 1852, the third son of John Christopher Dreyer, lieutenant-general in the Danish army, and his wife, Ida Nicoline Margarethe Rangrup. At the age of fourteen he read a book about Tycho Brahe which inspired him to &#145;be an astronomer and nothing else&#146;; he &#145;admired the bold use of large instruments and the ambitious cataloguing undertaken by his countryman&#146;  (Gingerich, &#145;Dreyer and his NGC&#146;, 621). During monthly visits to the Copenhagen University observatory he was encouraged by Hans Schjellerup, an assistant there. He entered the university in 1869 to study logic, mathematics, and astronomy, and by 1870 he was given free access to the instruments of the observatory and encouraged to compute. In 1874 he was awarded a gold medal by the university for an essay on &#145;Personal errors in observations&#146;. He graduated MA, and received a PhD in 1882 for his memoir on &#145;The constant of precession&#146;.<br>
<br>Dreyer's wife, Katherine Hannah, whom he married in 1875, was the daughter of John Tuthill of Kilmore, co. Limerick, Ireland. This connection and Dreyer's reputation gained him an invitation the previous year to succeed as astronomer in charge of the fourth earl of Rosse's observatory at Birr Castle, Parsonstown, King's county. His task was to complete the third earl's observations of nebulae and clusters made between 1848 and 1867 and prepare the work for publication. With the great 36 inch and 72 inch reflecting telescopes he made many observations. There was no good catalogue of nebulae and clusters: Messier had catalogued 109 objects, John Herschel 5079 more. In an important supplement to Herschel's catalogue of 1864, Dreyer provided notes and corrections to Herschel's objects and added 1172 more. This completed the work at Birr, and demonstrated Dreyer's skills in assessing errors and making precision measurements and his painstaking scholarship. In 1878 he became an assistant at the Dublin University observatory at Dunsink, and took charge of the new meridian circle.<br>
<br>In June 1882 Dreyer became the fourth director of the Church of Ireland's observatory at Armagh. The best candidate in Ireland, he was the first incumbent not to be Irish, clerical, and a graduate of Trinity College. He completed and reduced the meridian observations made by his predecessor, T. R. Robinson, since 1859, and the accuracy of the positions after his analysis of the systematic errors of the observations, together with his identification of the proper motions of twenty-nine stars, gave the <span class="italic">Second Armagh Catalogue of 3300 Stars</span> (1886) lasting value. The observatory's meridian instruments of 1827 were obsolete. The site, noted for &#145;extreme unfavourableness&#146; of climate in 1796, had been rendered &#145;never again [suitable] for fundamental measurement&#146; by a railway in 1874  (Bennett, 46, 150). The 1869 disestablishment of the church had halved observatory income; in 1884 Dreyer's salary was reduced, and his assistant paid only enough for meteorology. The Treasury declined support, but made a one-off grant of &pound;2000. Dreyer installed a new 10 inch Grubb equatorial refractor in 1885, and until the early 1900s made micrometric positional measurements of nebulae with respect to comparison stars.<br>
<br>In 1886 Dreyer submitted to the council of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) a second supplementary catalogue of nebulae, but the council invited him instead to compile a complete catalogue of all known nebulae. Dreyer completed the enormous task in only two years. It was published as <span class="italic">A new general catalogue of nebulae and clusters of stars, being the catalogue of Sir John Herschel, revised, corrected and enlarged</span> (1888) (<span class="roman">NGC</span>), and contained the positions and descriptions of 7840 nebulae and clusters. Two index catalogues of 1895 and 1908 added 5386 more, all listed in order of right ascension, with their north polar distances. A major contribution to astronomy, the <span class="roman">NGC</span> numbers remain the universally employed nomenclature.<br>
<br>Dreyer's historical curiosity and empathy disposed him to many years studying all sources on Tycho Brahe. In 1890 he published a biography of his hero, which was superseded only by Victor Thoren's <span class="italic">Lord of Uraniborg</span> (1991). Dreyer complemented his work with the classic <span class="italic">History of the Planetary Systems from Thales to Kepler</span> (1906). This drew on original sources, and explained man's conception of the universe from about 500 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to Kepler's mathematical proof of the Copernican system.<br>
<br>Dreyer &#145;enriched astronomy by three monumental works of research, collection, and editing&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSB</span>). The first was the <span class="roman">NGC</span> of 1888&#150;1908. In 1908 Dreyer began the second, a complete edition of the observations of Tycho Brahe, under the auspices of the Carlsberg Institute. Later, the generosity of G. A. Hagemann of Copenhagen made it possible to include all the works and correspondence of Brahe, published and unpublished. The fourteen volumes of <span class="italic">Tychonis Brahe opera omnia</span> (1913&#150;26) in Latin include two long introductions by Dreyer, one an account of Brahe's work, the other regarding the quality of his observations, both translated into Latin. Despite its inaccessibility, it remains the foundation of contemporary work on Brahe. Dreyer's third monumental work resulted from the councils of the Royal Society and the RAS inviting him to edit a complete edition of the works of Sir William Herschel. <span class="italic">The Scientific Papers of Sir William Herschel</span> (2 vols., 1912) contain seventy-one published and some thirty unpublished papers. Dreyer checked the original observations and reductions of nebulae and double stars, and added a fine introductory biography based mainly on unpublished material.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Dreyer never lost interest in practical astronomy. Recognizing that visual micrometer work had been superseded, in 1898 he purchased a micrometer microscope to enable him to measure photographic plates of nebulae supplied by Isaac Roberts. That work, &#145;a step on Dreyer's path from the dome to the study&#146;  (Bennett, 168), engaged him from 1899 until Roberts's death in 1904.<br>
<br>After a new financial crisis in 1897, Dreyer's salary slumped to &pound;140, that appropriate to a junior assistant, and the whole situation must have been dispiriting. Dreyer promptly applied for the newly vacant Radcliffe observership at Oxford, but the appointment went to Arthur Alcock Rambaut from Dunsink. He applied on 30 July to William Christie, the astronomer royal, for a reference to support his application to return to Dunsink in place of Rambaut. After all his underpaid service to Irish astronomy he was surely bitter to receive a reply on 5 October that Christie was supporting two &#145;very well qualified&#146; young Cambridge candidates from his own staff, and would support no others  (Christie to Dreyer, 5 Oct 1897, CUL, RGO 7 156 Radcl.). Meanwhile Trinity College appointed Charles J. Joly (1864&#150;1906), a mathematician and one of their own fellows since 1894, but a man who had no knowledge of practical astronomy.<br>
<br>In 1916 Dreyer was awarded the RAS gold medal for the <span class="roman">NGC</span> and historical work. Fortunately the Carlsberg Institute enabled him to retire to Oxford and devote himself to writing. He served on the council of the RAS from 1917, and was president in 1923 and 1924. In that office he collaborated with Professor H. H. Turner and supervised <span class="italic">A History of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1820&#150;1920</span> in commemoration of the society's centenary.<br>
<br>Dreyer's astronomical posts were less important than his linguistic, historical, and scientific skills, and the thoroughness of his scholarship, &#145;such as rarely decorates our science&#146;  (Sampson, &#145;Dreyer's &#147;Tycho Brahe&#148;&#146;, 159), gave his astronomical as well as his historical work lasting importance. His gifts were matched by an unsparing devotion to astronomy. He was endeared to many friends by his gentle and amiable disposition. In late 1925 his health began to fail as a consequence of stomach cancer, and he died at his home, 14 Staverton Road, Oxford, on 14 September 1926. He had been naturalized a British citizen in March 1885, and received an honorary DSc from Queen's University, Belfast, and an honorary MA from Oxford. Dreyer's wife had died in 1923; they had a daughter and three sons, the second of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32893/', "Sir Frederic Dreyer (1878&#150;1956)")</script>.<br>
