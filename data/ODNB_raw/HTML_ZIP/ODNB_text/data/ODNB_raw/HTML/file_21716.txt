<span class="headword">Pearson,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1740&#150;1838), <span class="occ">glass painter</span>, was born in Dublin but played a significant role in the revival of English enamel glass painting. He trained in the ceramics industry in Bristol but later moved to London and became a pupil of William Price the younger. His first documented commission was in 1769. His <span class="italic">Christ and the Four Evangelists</span> (1776), after designs by John Hamilton Mortimer, survives in Brasenose College chapel, Oxford. <span class="italic">Moses and the Brazen Serpent</span> (1781, after Mortimer) also survives in Salisbury Cathedral. Pearson produced a wide range of religious and secular works, heraldry, and ornament throughout his long career, and frequently exhibited from his own homes in London (21 Great Newport Street, Long Acre; 112 Great Russell Street) and in the Pantheon, Oxford Street. His speciality was large-scale copies of well-known paintings in which the supporting lead and iron work were skilfully concealed by complex technical means. A life-sized portrait of George III of 1793 (after Sir Joshua Reynolds) in the Stained Glass Museum in Ely Cathedral, and the east window of St Botolph, Aldersgate, of 1788&#151;<span class="italic">The Agony in the Garden</span> (after Charles Le Brun)&#151;are highly characteristic works. On 23 June 1768, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Pearson married Eglington Margaret [<a name="cosubject_21712"></a><span class="headword">Eglington Margaret Pearson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1823)], daughter of the auctioneer and bookseller Samuel Paterson (1724&#150;1802) and his wife, whose maiden name was Hamilton. She had been baptized on 5 November 1746 at St Paul's, Covent Garden. She was also a talented glass painter specializing in small-scale, finely detailed panels&#151;particularly flower and bird portraits&#151;for the burgeoning domestic market. Her copies of the Raphael cartoons (one of which is in the orangery of Bowood House, Calne, Wiltshire) were much admired. The Pearsons both exhibited at the Society of Artists' exhibitions in 1775, 1776, and 1777 when they resided in Church Street, St John's, Westminster. Despite very different working styles they sometimes collaborated on individual pieces such as copies of <span class="italic">The Salutation</span> by Carlo Maratti and Guido's <span class="italic">Aurora</span>. A collection of their small paintings on glass was sold by auction in 1797. James Pearson was still exhibiting glass as late as 1821. He painted glass for the church of St Giles Cripplegate, and for the parish churches of Battersea and Wandsworth. Margaret Pearson died on 14 February 1823. In 1837 Pearson was forced to apply to the Royal Academy for financial assistance. He died in 1838.<br>
