<span class="headword">Lindsell,  Augustine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was born at Steeple Bumpstead, Essex. On 14 April 1592 he was admitted a pensioner of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but it was from Clare College that he graduated BA in 1596 and proceeded MA in 1599, and where he became a fellow. An Oxford MA by incorporation was bestowed upon him in July 1614. He was instituted rector of Molesworth, Huntingdonshire, in 1606, rector of Wickford, Essex, in March 1610, and granted a prebend of Lincoln Cathedral by Bishop William Barlow in November 1612, a position that he held until 1624. On the appointment of Bishop Richard Neile to Lincoln in 1614, Lindsell acquired a more powerful patron. He followed Neile to Durham and in March 1619 was collated to the tenth stall of that cathedral, which he resigned for the second stall in August 1620. He proceeded DD in 1621 and became a firm&#151;and resident&#151;member of the &#145;Durham House group&#146; located at Neile's diocesan house in the Strand, London. Close friends with other intellectuals of the group like John Cosin and Richard Mountague, Lindsell was one of Neile's chaplains closely involved in the publication of Mountague's controversial <span class="italic">A New Gagg for an Old Goose</span> in 1624. He was strongly associated with the ceremonial changes for which Durham Cathedral became infamous in parliamentary circles in 1628&#150;9, when Peter Smart described him as &#145;the oracle of our Arminian sectaryes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Cosin</span>, 175).<br>
<br>Lindsell was an unsuccessful candidate for the regius professorship of Greek at Cambridge, vacant by the death of Andrew Downes in 1627, but his clerical career was enhanced when he was installed dean of Lichfield on 15 October 1628. His relatively high profile at Durham ensured that he came under attack when Peter Smart's allegations about ceremonial changes became public, and Neile and William Laud had to intervene to protect Lindsell and Cosin when Durham was presided over by a less sympathetic Bishop John Howson after 1628 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72182/', "Durham House group")</script>]. Fortunately for Lindsell, Neile and Laud quite clearly had the ear of King Charles by this date. On 10 February 1633 Lindsell was consecrated bishop of Peterborough (to which was attached the rectory of Castor, Northamptonshire), where he sought to effect greater respect for baptism, greater conformity to the rites of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and to suppress nonconformist lecturers. His articles of visitation which survive for 1633 were firmly based on a set devised for Norwich diocese in 1619 by the prominent proto-Arminian Bishop John Overall, and he believed in them so firmly that he applied the same set when he was translated to Hereford in March 1634. According to William Prynne, Lindsell was:<blockquote>an earnest promoter of the book of pastimes on the Lord's day, a great champion for the Arminians, and all the late innovations in doctrine, ceremony or worship introduced among us, a bitter enemy to preaching, lecturers, lectures and godly people. (Prynne, chapter 6)</blockquote>The health of Lindsell, a leading intellectual of the Arminian party, had often been a cause of concern to his friends. If Prynne is to be believed, however, Lindsell died quite suddenly on 6 November 1634 as a result of the stress induced by quarrels with the dean and chapter of Hereford over the position of the altar. He died unmarried and was buried in Hereford Cathedral. In his will he bequeathed Greek books and manuscripts to Clare College; to Sir Robert Cotton he gave a manuscript history in Latin of Ely Cathedral. To his old patron Richard Neile he gave books, and in recognition of the part played by Neile's family in his life he gave Richard's wife, Dorothy, a piece of plate, and his son Paul a copy of John Speed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. Laud was also a beneficiary of books from a library which was said at the time to have been worth about &pound;800&#151;a rather significant collection. Other gifts went to Sir William Paddy, fellow Durham clergyman Daniel Birkhead, the civil lawyer Edward Lively, and his old pupil from Clare, Nicholas Ferrar. Apart from visitation articles produced for both of his dioceses, together with a set for Hereford Cathedral, Lindsell worked on an edition of Theophylact's commentaries on the epistles of <span class="roman">St Paul</span>, which was published by his associate in the work, Dr Thomas Baily, subdean of Wells, in 1636; it was aptly dedicated to William Laud. Together with Giles Thompson, Lindsell is one of only two bishops of the period 1559&#150;1660 who does not appear to have been granted a coat of arms.<br>
