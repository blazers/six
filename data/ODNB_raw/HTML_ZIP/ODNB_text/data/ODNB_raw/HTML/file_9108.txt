<span class="headword">O'Rourke,  Edmund</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Edmund Falconer]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1814&#150;1879), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born in Dublin about 1814, and entered the theatrical profession in 1835, playing utility parts for many years in the provinces. In 1850 he undertook the lead role in the Worcester circuit, and his last provincial engagement was in the autumn of 1854 at the Adelphi Theatre, Liverpool, where he acted Hamlet and Three-fingered Jack on the same night. While working in the country, he published a volume of poems, <span class="italic">Man's Mission</span> (1852).<br>
<br>Falconer's career as a London dramatist began with <span class="italic">Heart for Heart</span>, his first full-length verse play, which was brought out at the Lyceum Theatre under Charles Dillon's management on 6 December 1856, with much success. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> commented &#145;the dialogue is remarkable for noble sentiment, although the verse is not always correct&#146;  (13 Dec 1856). His next piece was <span class="italic">A Husband for an Hour</span>, produced at the Haymarket on 1 June 1857.<br>
<br>Falconer had translated Victor Hugo's <span class="italic">Ruy Blas</span>, which was performed at the Princess Theatre late in 1858. During that year, he began his profitable collaboration with Michael Balfe by writing the libretto for Balfe's much-loved opera <span class="italic">The Rose of Castile</span>. He was later to write librettos for several of Balfe's most successful productions, including <span class="italic">Satanella, or, The Power of Love</span>, first produced at Covent Garden on 20 December 1858, and the popular song &#145;Killarney&#146;, which remained a concert-hall favourite well into the twentieth century. During this period, his first marriage was dissolved and he married secondly a daughter of John Neville, the widow of Weston the actor. On 26 August 1858, in partnership with Webster, he opened the Lyceum, and put on the stage his own play, <span class="italic">Extremes</span>, a comedy of manners. <span class="italic">The Times</span> commented &#145;The characters are sharply defined and exactly of a kind to be perfectly intelligible to a large audience&#146;  (27 Aug 1858). He followed this with another piece, <span class="italic">Francesca</span>, on 31 March 1859.<br>
<br>Later that year Falconer moved to the Princess's Theatre, London, writing <span class="italic">The Master Passion</span>, first played on 2 November 1859. In the first production of Boucicault's <span class="italic">The Colleen Bawn</span>, at the Adelphi on 18 July 1860, Falconer played Danny Man, which he continued to perform throughout the original run of the piece, a period of 231 nights.<br>
<br>In 1861 Falconer resumed the management of the Lyceum, and brought out on 19 August his comedy <span class="italic">Woman, or, Love Against the World</span>. His most popular play, <span class="italic">Peep o' Day</span>, first acted in London on 9 November 1861, which was adapted from John Banim's novellas <span class="italic">John Doe</span> and <span class="italic">The Nolans</span>, enjoyed an uninterrupted run until December 1862. Meanwhile, he contributed two comedies to the Haymarket, <span class="italic">Family Wills</span>, and <span class="italic">Does He Love Me?</span>, both starring Amy Sedgwick. In 1862 Falconer invested the &pound;13,000 he had made at the Lyceum in a joint lease with Frederick Balsir Chatterton of the Drury Lane Theatre, for which between 1863 and 1865 he wrote and produced <span class="italic">Bonnie Dundee</span>, <span class="italic">Nature's above Art</span>, <span class="italic">Night and Morning</span>, and <span class="italic">Love's Ordeal, or, The Old and New R&eacute;gime</span>. In addition he wrote <span class="italic">The O'Flahertys</span> and <span class="italic">Galway-go-bragh</span>, a dramatization of Lever's <span class="italic">Charles O'Malley</span>, in which he took the part of Mickey Free. As the lessee of Drury Lane, and later as the manager of the Haymarket from 1866, Falconer attempted to popularize Shakespeare, and he directed productions of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, and <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, among others. Although he employed the best contemporary actors, his Shakespeare revival was not popular, and audiences were small. &#145;Nothing drew good houses&#146;, remarked Edward Stirling  (p. 274). In June 1864 Falconer's second wife died. By September 1866, he had lost all his investment, and resigned the lease to his partner Chatterton, who discharged his own and Falconer's liabilities.<br>
<br>While at Drury Lane, Falconer had attempted to establish himself as a poet, publishing <span class="italic">Memories, the Bequest of My Boyhood</span> in 1863, and <span class="italic">O'Ruark's Bride: the Blood Speck in the Emerald</span> in 1865. Both collections drew heavily on his childhood in Ireland, and on traditional Irish legends, but they did not meet with any great success. After the Drury Lane disaster, Falconer attempted to revive his fortunes with his five-act drama <span class="italic">Oonagh, or, The Lovers of Lisnamona</span>, which was performed at Her Majesty's Theatre on 19 November 1866, but was such a failure that its season suddenly terminated ten days later.<br>
<br>Falconer then went to America, where his play <span class="italic">Peep o' Day</span> had won him a popular following. He toured the continent, finding special success in New York and Boston, where publications of his plays went through several editions. He remained in America for about three years, marrying an American wife and writing three new dramas. During his absence, <span class="italic">A Wife Well Won</span> was successful at the Haymarket, which encouraged him to return to London about 1871. On his return, he produced at the Princess Theatre <span class="italic">Eileen Oge</span>, an adaptation of Balfe's light opera <span class="italic">Inisfallen</span> on which Falconer had collaborated, and which was otherwise known as <span class="italic">Killarney</span> from its most popular song. It was his swansong: shortly after its success, Falconer retired. He died at his home, 28 Keppel Street, Russell Square, London, on 29 September 1879, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
