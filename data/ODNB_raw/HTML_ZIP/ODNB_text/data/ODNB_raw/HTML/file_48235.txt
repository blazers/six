<span class="headword">Osborne,  Walter Victor</span>  (1870&#150;1950), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born at Wilby, Norfolk, on 1 September 1870, the son of James Osborne (or Osborn), a shepherd, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frost. From about 1890 he worked for the Great Eastern railway, his employers for twenty-two years. On 15 October 1896, at the Wesleyan Methodist centenary chapel, York, he married Naomi Wright, a native of Norfolk who was working as a domestic servant in York; she was the daughter of John Wright, a farm labourer. At the time of his marriage Osborne was a foreman railway porter living in Stoke Newington, London; by 1901 the couple had settled with a two-year-old daughter in Walthamstow, their long-term residence.<br>
<br>As a young man Osborne had been a member of the extreme Social Democratic Federation at some time in the late 1880s or early 1890s, but had soon left and become a consistent anti-socialist. Among those who knew him personally he had a reputation for being honest and humorous, though somewhat lethargic and excessively devoted to his personal freedom, refusing, for example, to work overtime for the Great Eastern railway. However, he rose to the position of head porter at Clapton station in north London while remaining a member of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, which he had joined in 1892. Indeed, in 1897 he organized a local branch of the union in Walthamstow and served as branch secretary. Along with many of his contemporaries in the trade union movement of the 1900s he combined approval for the labour representation committee (LRC) with a continued commitment to Liberalism, and was consequently a warm supporter of the railway servants' general secretary, Richard Bell, one of the first LRC candidates to be elected to parliament, where he worked closely with the Liberal Party.<br>
<br>Osborne, however, began to feel unhappy about developments in labour politics in 1903. In the first place the LRC decided to impose a pledge on its candidates to form a distinct group in parliament separate from other parties, a pledge which Bell refused to accept and in which he was supported by a majority at the railway servants' conference in 1904. In the second place the general meeting of the railway servants decided to make the political levy compulsory for all members, and the socialist dominated executive committee chose three socialists as the union's next candidates for parliament. Osborne carried a motion at the Walthamstow branch to discontinue paying the political levy and fifty-three other branches of the union called for a ballot on the question of affiliation to the LRC. However, when such a ballot was held in 1905, 81 per cent of those voting were in favour of maintaining the existing levy arrangements. Osborne seems to have had an exaggerated idea of the extent to which the emerging Labour Party was dominated by socialists, perhaps because of his experience of the executive of his own union, and although his views were not unique they were clearly shared by only a minority.<br>
<br>Osborne pressed stubbornly ahead with legal action against the railway servants' political levy in 1907, supported by money raised by readers of the tory newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. His case was defeated in the High Court but was successful in the Court of Appeal in 1908 on the grounds that the definition of a trade union in the 1876 act did not include the support of a political party. This time Osborne was supported by money raised not only through the national press, but apparently also through small subscriptions from sympathetic union branches. The railway servants backed by the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, which stood to lose the bulk of its financial base if denied trade union support, then took the case to the House of Lords where the Osborne judgment was upheld in November 1909. Not satisfied with this Osborne instructed his solicitor to take legal action over the use of the railwaymen's already accumulated political fund; the union's executive retaliated by expelling him, but this only led Osborne to start another legal action for his reinstatement, which was dismissed in the High Court but upheld in the Court of Appeal. Once again the railwaymen prepared to take the case as far as the House of Lords, but reached a settlement with Osborne's solicitor before the hearing. Osborne was by then such a well-known figure that he was able to launch a brief career as a writer on trade union issues, publishing two books defending his activities, <span class="italic">My Case</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Sane Trade Unionism</span> (1913), and also to secure appointment as the chief clerk of the anti-socialist British Constitution Association.<br>
<br>The success of Osborne's campaign was short-lived, however, for, while the Liberal government could hardly denounce one of its own supporters who had pursued his right to freedom of conscience, it was increasingly dependent on the Labour Party for its small majority in the House of Commons after the 1910 general election. As a result the Liberals softened the impact of the Osborne judgment by introducing the payment of MPs in the budget of 1911; and then reversed it in the <span class="roman">Trade Union Act</span> of 1913, by legalizing the financing of political action provided that the payments came from a special political fund from which individual members should have the right to contract out. The Labour Party meanwhile became the undisputed focus for trade union political representation as a result of its leading role in securing the legislation to remedy the Osborne judgment. In this way Osborne's activities may have strengthened the Labour Party and certainly initiated an important party division over British trade union law. In 1927 the Conservatives put the burden on those who wished to contract in to political levies. Labour repealed this legislation in 1946, thus restoring the 1913 position. The Conservatives imposed regular ballots on the continuation of union political funds in 1984.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Osborne continued to campaign against what he described, at a meeting of the National League of Liberal Trade Unionists and Cooperatives, as &#145;socialist tyranny&#146;. By fighting Liberals, he complained, the Labour Party had divided the progressive vote  (<span class="italic">Walthamstow Guardian</span>, 20 April 1928). By then, however, he had disappeared from national view. No obituary has been traced following his death, at the City General Hospital, York, on 15 June 1950.<br>
