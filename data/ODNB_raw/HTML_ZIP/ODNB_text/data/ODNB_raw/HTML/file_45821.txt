<span class="headword">Ross <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Collace]</span>,  Katherine</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1697), <span class="occ">memoirist and schoolmistress</span>, was born in Edinburgh, one of five daughters of Francis Collace (<i>c</i>.1595&#150;1647), minister of Gordon, and his wife, Marion Muirhead. She describes herself as having been &#145;religiously educate&#146;  (Ross, 8) and notes her conversion at age fourteen, probably under the ministry of Hew Mackail, minister of Trinity in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>After her marriage on 31 January 1650 to John Ross (<i>d</i>. 1674?) Katherine moved north, initially to Tain in Ross, but then to Moray, eventually settling at Bridge End of Inschol near Auldearn. Little is known about her husband except that her friends unite in calling him &#145;wicked&#146; (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Laing, 324; NL Scot., Adv. MS 32.4.4, p. 86). Katherine herself speaks of her marriage as &#145;24 years of affliction&#146;  (Ross, 9). In the course of it she gave birth to twelve children, all of whom predeceased her. She developed her spiritual life in depth under the ministry of Thomas Hog. It greatly comforted her over the deaths of her children and no doubt also made her marriage easier to bear. By 1667 her spiritual commitment had developed into religious radicalism.<br>
<br>Around this point, Katherine embarked upon a career of covenanting civil disobedience: refusing to hear the episcopal clergy preach, attending conventicles, reproving her social superiors such as the lairds of Innes and Brodie for acts of conformity, and even refusing to have her children wet-nursed by anyone who had taken the oath of supremacy. In refusing to hear the episcopal clergy both she and her sister Jean were pioneers in their respective parishes, obtaining indulgence and support from their female social superiors who were soon to join them in their protest. Katherine's memoirs in this period read like a who's who of conventicling in the east of Scotland. Thomas Hog, John Welsh, John Welwood, and Thomas Ross were all among her friends and spiritual counsellors. Several letters of spiritual counsel are still extant from Welwood to Katherine and to her sisters Jean and Elizabeth  (NL Scot., Adv. MS 32.4.4).<br>
<br>After the death of Katherine's husband, probably in 1674, she and Jean moved to Falkland in Fife where they became part of the small circle of covenanting resistance in a mostly conforming area. Here they worked as schoolmistresses teaching sewing to the daughters of gentry, but, given their pride in the number of their scholars religiously converted in their hands, it is probable that they also provided religious instruction. This no doubt contributed to their appearance before a local court where they were only saved from prosecution by the interposition of a local noblewoman (perhaps the countess of Rothes). It would also account for the attempted kidnap of one of their scholars by her episcopal relatives. Katherine was quite capable of teaching more than sewing: listing Samuel Rutherford, David Calderwood, and Thomas Shepherd among her favourite authors, she was not only an avid reader but a fluent writer. Over the course of her career as a strict covenanter she was asked to set down her spiritual experiences for the benefit of others, which she did in the shape of her memoirs which circulated in manuscript before being published in 1735 (after her death) by James Hog, minister of Carnock, Fife.<br>
<br>After another brief stay in Auldearn, about 1677 Katherine returned to Edinburgh where she apparently refused to join the United Societies out of a dislike of separatism. She died there on 10 July 1697, much admired for her piety and considered by Hog as &#145;one well fit to teach such a weakling as I&#146;  (Ross, 5). She was buried on the following day in Greyfriars kirkyard.<br>
