<span class="headword">Bishop,  Caroline Garrison</span>  (1846&#150;1929), <span class="occ">promoter of kindergarten education</span>, was born on 18 October 1846 at St Leonards, Heavitree, Devon, daughter of the Revd Francis Bishop, minister in the Unitarian church, and his first wife, Lavinia, daughter of Isaac Solly. Her mother died when she was six and her father remarried. Caroline subsequently had a stepbrother and stepsister for whose care she was given responsibility. Caroline's second name reflects her father's admiration for William Lloyd Garrison, the founder of the anti-slavery movement in America. When the family moved to Liverpool Caroline came into contact with runaway slaves who visited their house and the family took part in bazaars to raise funds for the cause.<br>
<br>At the age of eleven Caroline Bishop was sent to a school at R&ouml;delheim, near Frankfurt am Main. The school, housed in an old castle, was recommended to her maternal aunt, Charlotte Manning, by Florence Nightingale. It was happily remembered and she gained a facility in the German language which was to prove invaluable for her career as a Froebelian. After two years, in 1859, she returned to England and attended a school at Knutsford (the village which was the model for Mrs Gaskell's <span class="italic">Cranford</span>), and was a fellow pupil of one of the author's daughters. She subsequently moved to London in the early 1860s to continue her studies at 32 Tavistock Place under the two Praetorious sisters, who had taken over the kindergarten and school established by Bertha and Johannes Ronge in 1853. This formed her introduction to the Froebelian ideas which were to motivate her lifelong educational work. Her friendship with her stepcousin, Elizabeth Adelaide Manning, developed at this period and Caroline introduced her to the Froebel Society; Adelaide subsequently became its honorary secretary and treasurer.<br>
<br>During the early 1870s Caroline went to Berlin to continue her studies in education, staying with relatives of her mother. On her return to England she spent two years as governess to four of the younger children of George MacDonald in their home at Tudor Lodge, Albert Street, Regent's Park, forming friendships with both her charges and their father. &#145;&#147;Well, Bunny!&#148; was George MacDonald's greeting to her years later, after a lecture in Birmingham&#146;  (Last, 222).<br>
<br>In 1873 the school management committee of the London school board recommended the appointment of an instructor in &#145;Kinder Garten [<i>sic</i>] exercises&#146;. Caroline Bishop was duly appointed in October 1873 at a salary of &pound;100 p.a. plus travelling expenses. The success of the classes, which began in January 1874, was so considerable that it was necessary to restrict them to pupil-teachers in the five training centres. The emphasis in the twelve-week course was on the practical aspects of kindergarten education but the initial results were poor; only ninety-three passed the two-hour examination out of 199 candidates. Eleanor Heerwart, lecturer in kindergarten at Stockwell Training College, advised the board to concentrate on training head teachers and their assistants adequately in kindergarten principles before attempting to introduce Froebelian ideas throughout its infants' schools. Classes were subsequently arranged for them at various centres and the requirement that they should attend was strictly enforced. Inspectors were to report on schools where the exercises had not been introduced or were inadequately presented. Other duties of the post included visiting schools to advise on methods and the establishment of model kindergartens in three infants' schools. Caroline Bishop remained as instructor until 1877. By then the board was insisting that every infants' school should have at least one teacher trained in kindergarten methods and the Froebel Gifts and Occupations had been introduced into nearly all London infants' schools.<br>
<br>Caroline Bishop attended the preliminary meeting of the Froebel Society at the Kensington home of Fraulein Beata Doreck in November 1874 and became a member of the committee in 1878. She supported the attempts of the Froebel Society to establish its own central kindergarten and training institution. In 1879 she returned to Germany to continue her studies at the Pestalozzi-Froebel House in Berlin, under the principal Fraulein Annette Schepel. When she returned to London she was appointed to the post of principal of the Tavistock Place Training College. This new venture by the Froebel Society in training teachers in a specifically Froebelian, non-denominational college was not to prove a success. Disagreements with the society led her to resign after two years, and she returned to Berlin where she took charge of the Pestalozzi-Froebel House in Fraulein Schepel's absence.<br>
<br>Caroline Bishop returned to England in 1883 with Herr and Frau Schrader and Fraulein Schepel, and met Miss Emily Last, later her biographer and close colleague. She moved to Edgbaston where she took over a kindergarten, which she ran for twenty-three years, adding a transition class, schoolrooms, and a training college to the original kindergarten. Emily Last joined her staff in 1886 and the training college became residential in 1894 when premises at 18 Harborne Road, Edgbaston, became available. The Edgbaston Froebel College, School and Kindergarten was the culmination of Caroline Bishop's work to promote Froebelian education, and Emily Last's memoir of her contains many examples of her influence on a succession of children and students. Students trained at the Edgbaston college supplied many of the superintendents for the Greet Free Kindergarten in Birmingham, which opened in 1904 with funds provided by Mr and Mrs Barrow Cadbury, and supported by Miss Bishop. One former pupil remembered her as a disciplinarian: &#145;Her &#147;Put back your chair. Stand,&#148; was enough to bring the most hardened offender to a sense of the enormity of his transgression. But I don't think any child was frightened&#146;  (Last, 94). A past student described her as &#145;short of stature, with her large and piercing blue eyes&#146;  (ibid., 95), while another recalled her &#145;vigorous geniality&#146;  (ibid., 75). A common theme is her leadership: &#145;She took us all, younger or older, a jumble lot, many of us much cumbered with cares of self, and showed us the deeper things of life&#146;  (ibid., 71&#150;2). Her pamphlet <span class="italic">Life in the Kindergarten</span> (1895) was reprinted in <span class="italic">Child Life</span> (16, 1914) and her paper to the Froebel Society, &#145;Ideals of training for Froebelian teachers&#146;, appeared in the third volume of <span class="italic">Child Life</span> (1901).<br>
<br>When she retired in 1906 Caroline Bishop moved to Knighton, a suburb of Leicester, and became manager of Medway Street infants' school. From 1910 to 1913 she served as a Guardian of the Poor in the Newton ward of Leicester and sat on the children's committee, which dealt with issues such as emigration and adoption of children and visiting arrangements with parents. She supported the proposal that relieving officers should be required to report on the physical condition of children under school age whose parents were in receipt of outdoor relief. When her health began to fail in 1923 Caroline Bishop, who was unmarried, moved to Felden, Boxmoor, in Hertfordshire, to live with Emily Last at Dew Green Cottage, and died there on 12 December 1929.<br>
