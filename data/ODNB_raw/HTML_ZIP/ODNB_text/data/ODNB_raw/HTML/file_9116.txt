<span class="headword">Falconer,  Thomas</span>  (1805&#150;1882), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 25 June 1805, the second son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9115/', "Revd Thomas Falconer, MD, (1771&#150;1839)")</script>, of Bath, and his wife, Frances, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Raitt of the 2nd regiment; he was a great-grandson of William Falconer, recorder of Chester. He was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn on 13 November 1823 and was called to the bar on 8 February 1830. Falconer practised as an equity draftsman and conveyancer, and from 1837 to 1840 held the post of revising barrister for the boroughs of Finsbury, Tower Hamlets, and Marylebone. In the 1830s he was an active committee member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, playing an important part in choosing manuscripts for publication by the society. Falconer also acted as nominal editor of the <span class="italic">London Review</span> after its foundation in 1834 by a group of philosophic radicals (including his sister's husband, J. A. Roebuck) who were dissatisfied with the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>. In practice, however, he was only the sub-editor. He resigned his post in 1837, as a result of disagreements with the true editor, John Stuart Mill, who was often exasperated by what he saw as Falconer's inefficiency. Falconer also contributed a tract on <span class="italic">Orange Societies</span> (1835) to Roebuck's <span class="roman">Pamphlets for the People</span>, and wrote an account, published by the English Presbyterian Association in 1834, of the history and legal position of English Presbyterians.<br>
<br>Falconer was a laborious worker, a staunch Liberal, a committed law reformer, and an energetic opponent of abuses. He was highly critical of the policies pursued in Lower Canada regarding political prisoners detained in the aftermath of the rebellion of the <i>patriotes</i> in 1837. He subsequently spent more than two years in travelling through North America, returning to England in December 1842. His interest in Canada continued: in 1850 he was appointed by the earl of Elgin, governor-in-chief of British North America, and his council to act as arbitrator on behalf of that province for the purpose of determining the boundaries between Canada and New Brunswick.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1851 he was nominated colonial secretary of Western Australia, but after resigning his appointment he was appointed on 22 December 1851 by the lord chancellor, Lord Truro, to be the judge of the county courts of Glamorgan and Brecknockshire, and of the district of Rhayader. Falconer was an energetic county court judge, who worked tirelessly in this position, travelling twenty-two days and covering 400 miles on circuit every month. Through his dedication, he managed almost to extinguish the civil business of the assizes in Glamorgan. He was also a staunch defender of the county court system against those who doubted its efficiency.<br>
<br>After sitting on the bench for thirty years he retired in December 1881. He died at 18 Royal Crescent, Bath, on 28 August 1882, in the seventy-eighth year of his age. He appears never to have married. He was a member of several learned societies, and was a traveller of much experience. He was an occasional contributor to the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Colonial Magazine</span>, and was the author of several books and a very large number of pamphlets.<br>
