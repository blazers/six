<span class="headword">Somervell, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1863&#150;1937), <span class="occ">composer and educationist</span>, was born on 5 June 1863 at Hazelthwaite in Applethwaite, Cumberland, the youngest of six sons and nine children of Robert Miller Somervell, leather merchant and founder of Somervell Brothers (manufacturers of K Shoes), and his wife, Anne Wilson. After a short period at Uppingham School (1878&#150;9) he entered King's College, Cambridge, where he took an ordinary BA in history (1884). While at the university he studied composition under Sir Charles Stanford and, as an active member of the Cambridge University Musical Society, was introduced to Joseph Joachim and Sir Hubert Parry. At Stanford's recommendation he worked under Friedrich Kiel (Stanford's former teacher) and Woldemar Bargiel at the Berlin Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik (1884&#150;5). On returning to England he studied (again at Stanford's recommendation) for two years with Parry (1885&#150;7) at the Royal College of Music before he began to make a living as a teacher, composer, and examiner, joining the staff of the Royal College of Music in 1894. Somervell married Edith Lance (<i>b</i>. 1862) (herself an educationist), daughter of James Collet, civil engineer, on 5 August 1890. They had twin sons (who both joined the shoe-manufacturing company) and two daughters. On his return from Australia in 1900, where he had been examining for the Associated Board, he succeeded John Stainer as inspector of music to the Board of Education, a controversial appointment, in that W. G. McNaught, Stainer's assistant, had considered himself the natural heir. In 1920 he became chief inspector, a position that he held until retirement in 1928. The following year he was knighted for his services to music education.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Somervell produced the majority of his large-scale choral works for provincial festivals&#151;the mass in C minor (Bach Choir, 1891) and the cantatas <span class="italic">The Forsaken Merman</span> (Leeds, 1895), <span class="italic">The Power of Sound</span> (Kendal, 1895), and <span class="italic">Ode to the Sea</span> (Birmingham, 1897)&#151;though arguably his finest work in this genre was <span class="italic">Ode on the Intimations of Immortality</span> (1907) from Wordsworth's <span class="italic">The Prelude</span>. He also produced two orchestral works, an orchestral ballad <span class="italic">Helen of Kirkconnel</span> (1893) and the suite <span class="italic">In Arcady</span> (1897), but it was not until much later in life that he turned seriously to the composition of instrumental music, even if his stylistic vision was by then rather dated. In 1912 he produced both the symphonic variations <span class="italic">Normandy</span> and the more nationally inspired maritime symphony <span class="italic">Thalassa</span>, replete with programme (premi&egrave;red by Arthur Nikisch); the slow movement of <span class="italic">Thalassa</span> enjoyed a modicum of popularity through its frequent hearing on occasions of national mourning. Somervell's other orchestral essays, in spite of their temporary approbation from those such as Tovey and their pedigree&#151;the <span class="italic">Concertst&uuml;ck</span> for violin and orchestra (1913) was written for Jelly d'Ar&aacute;nyi, and the later violin concerto (1932) commissioned by her elder sister, Adila Fachiri&#151;failed to make an impression, which Somervell blamed on his broad reputation as a composer of songs. Nevertheless, it is as a songwriter and, more particularly, as the author of several song cycles, that his name has endured. The first cycle, <span class="italic">Maud</span> (1899), a special favourite of Harry Plunket Greene, its dedicatee, was a highly successful selection of verse from Tennyson's dark monodrama in which the tensions of love and death are skilfully retained in the narrative. In <span class="italic">A Shropshire Lad</span> (1904) Somervell's lyrical gifts reached their zenith (even though Housman's biting irony lay beyond his grasp), while <span class="italic">James Lee's Wife</span> (1907) and, arguably his finest achievement, <span class="italic">A Broken Arc</span> (1923), articulate a sympathy for Browning's unorthodox, and at times complex, world of faith and morality. Indeed, such was Somervell's fascination for the song cycle that he might easily be dubbed the English Schumann, a label that would also be a fair summary of his stylistic parameters. In 1903, on the strength of his compositions, he was awarded the MusDoc at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Somervell's period in office as an inspector of music coincided with a major shift in education away from utilitarianism towards educational and artistic liberalism. His philosophy of musical education, derived from Plato and Aristotle, stressed the link between music and moral values, the essence of music as rhythm (reflecting the Edwardian preoccupation with the secular &#145;life force&#146;), and a vision of childhood that emphasized emotion and instinct. Somervell hoped that music could instil a sense of emancipation for the many, notably for the manual worker; in practical terms he believed that such educational aims could be realized through the development of sight-singing, familiarization with notation, and the singing of traditional and national songs (proselytized through Hadow's <span class="italic">Songs of the British Islands</span> of 1903 and Stanford's <span class="italic">National Song Book</span> of 1906). But most importantly Somervell campaigned tirelessly for music to be considered an indispensable constituent of the school curriculum at a time when the Board of Education remained cautious in its commitment&#151;work for which he is now largely forgotten. After retirement, his experience in musical education was still called upon, notably as the chairman of the School Orchestra Festivals at Queen's Hall, which he undertook from 1932 until his death at his home, 105 Clifton Hill, St John's Wood, London, on 2 May 1937. He was buried in his beloved Lake District.<br>
