<span class="headword">Tomkins,  Thomas</span>  (1572&#150;1656), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at St David's, Pembrokeshire, the son of Thomas Tomkins (<i>c</i>.1545&#150;1627) of Lostwithiel, Cornwall, vicar-choral of St David's Cathedral, and his first wife, Margaret Pore (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1583). In 1577 his father became organist and master of the choristers at St David's, but by 1594 he had moved to Gloucester as a minor canon. In the meantime Tomkins senior had married his second wife, Anne Hargest, with whom he had three other sons who subsequently also became notable musicians&#151;<a href="#cosubject_27510">John Tomkins</a>, <a href="#cosubject_27509">Giles Tomkins [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Robert Tomkins.<br>
<br>Little is known of Thomas Tomkins's early musical education. He was educated at home, and probably gained his knowledge of the rudiments as a treble at St David's. It would appear that at some stage before he was appointed organist of Worcester Cathedral in 1596 he studied with William Byrd, the most significant composer of the Elizabethan era. Regrettably, the dedication of his madrigal &#145;Too much I once lamented&#146;, from the <span class="italic">Songs of 3. 4. 5. &amp; 6. Parts</span> (1622), &#145;To my ancient and much reverenced master, William Byrd&#146; is ambiguous as to the specific nature of their relationship. The 1607 citation of his Oxford BMus degree notes that he had been &#145;14 years student in music&#146;: this would place the beginning of his formal instruction in 1593. In 1597 Tomkins married Alice Hassard (<i>c</i>.1563&#150;1642), widow of his predecessor as organist at Worcester, Nathaniel Patrick. Their son <a href="#cosubject_27513">Nathaniel Tomkins [<i>see below</i>]</a> was born in 1599, and they also had a daughter, Ursula.<br>
<br>Tomkins's investigation of music theory must have been significantly enhanced by the publication of Thomas Morley's <span class="italic">A Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music</span> (1597). He worked through Morley's treatise carefully, making a number of marginal annotations to his copy that betray a fascination with theoretical aspects of music. His interest in theoretical abstractions was complemented by antiquarian zeal. He became the owner of an important manuscript source of English liturgical organ music dating back to the Marian period (BL, Add. MS 29996), into which he subsequently copied a variety of later pieces in different genres by more up-to-date composers such as Byrd and John Bull along with some pieces of his own. More extensive than this composite manuscript is a holograph source (Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris, MS R&eacute;s. 1122) which includes a significant number of Tomkins's own keyboard pieces. Many of the works contained in this manuscript bear precise dates (unusual for this period); remarkably, most were composed when he was approaching eighty years of age. This manuscript also contains two lists of keyboard pieces by Tallis, Byrd, and Bull among others, including some comments on the relative merits of the latter two. Byrd's work is singled out &#145;for Substance&#146; (clearly an acknowledgement of Byrd's senior position among contemporary English composers), while Bull's is described as &#145;for the Hand&#146;, a comment inspired no doubt by its typically virtuosic technical demands, and not necessarily to be interpreted as a derogatory judgement. Tomkins's own keyboard works draw upon the techniques of both composers.<br>
<br>Clearly Tomkins's compositional gifts had made some impact in the capital by the turn of the century, since Morley included the madrigal &#145;The fauns and satyrs tripping&#146; in his famous anthology <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Oriana</span> (1601) alongside the work of more established court composers. Tomkins may well have become attached to the court in some capacity shortly thereafter, dividing his time, like a number of his contemporaries, between a cathedral post (at Worcester) and the occasional demands of the Chapel Royal. The cheque book of the Chapel Royal contains no entry relating to Tomkins's actual appointment as a gentleman in ordinary, though he had been elected by 29 June 1620, when his signature appears in a record of a vestry meeting. Evidently he had been connected with the court in some capacity for about a decade before this: his anthem &#145;Know ye not&#146; was clearly intended for the funeral of Prince Henry in 1612.<br>
<br>In 1621 Tomkins succeeded Edmund Hooper as an organist of the Chapel Royal, where his colleagues included Orlando Gibbons (senior organist) and Nathaniel Giles (master of the choristers). Both men were dedicatees the following year of madrigals in Tomkins's <span class="italic">Songs of 3. 4. 5. &amp; 6. Parts</span> (1622), a collection in which each piece bears a specific dedication, giving quite a detailed impression of the composer's social circle during the first quarter of the century. This included, in addition to colleagues such as Gibbons and Giles, the composers John Coprario, John Danyel, William Heather (soon to become the first professor of music at Oxford), and William Byrd, the poet Phineas Fletcher, and the anthologist Thomas Myriell, in whose manuscript collection, &#145;Tristitiae remedium&#146; (1616), Tomkins's best-known anthem, &#145;When David heard&#146;, is to be found. Following Gibbons's early death in 1625, Tomkins presumably became senior organist (although this is not specifically recorded) and was responsible, along with Giles, Heather, and John Stevens, for Charles I's coronation music. In 1628 he was the victim of an embarrassing administrative error by the bishop of Bath and Wells, who had drawn up a document appointing Tomkins &#145;Composer in Ordinary of the King's Musick&#146; in succession to Alfonso Ferrabosco the elder at a salary of &pound;40 per annum; this had to be hastily revoked when it was discovered that the position had previously been promised to Ferrabosco's son.<br>
<br>From about 1635 Tomkins's appearances at the Chapel Royal probably became less frequent. Although he enjoyed a long retirement, it cannot have been especially happy owing to a combination of personal and national misfortunes. Following the death of his wife, Alice, on 29 January 1642, Tomkins seems to have become increasingly involved in cathedral affairs at Worcester, a deepening involvement in a familiar environment from which he perhaps drew spiritual comfort amid the increasingly turbulent political scene. However, even that solace was short-lived. In 1646 Worcester surrendered to the parliamentary forces and cathedral services were effectively discontinued, although Tomkins (an ardent royalist) continued to reside in the cathedral close until 1654, when he moved to the nearby village of Martin Hussingtree to live with his son, Nathaniel. There he died in early June 1656, and was buried on 9 June.<br>
<br>Contemporaries considered Tomkins a worthy but not especially outstanding or idiosyncratic composer. It is perhaps significant that while seventeenth-century portraits of Bull and Gibbons survive in the Oxford music faculty there is none of Tomkins. His musical output is conservative in style. The keyboard pieces dating from the last decade of his life could easily have been composed sixty or more years earlier and include a relatively large quantity of pieces known as <span class="roman">In nomine</span>, a genre that had largely died out with Byrd (although some very late and uncharacteristic examples occur in the work of Purcell towards the end of the seventeenth century). While his instrumental music is significant, Tomkins's lasting contribution to English music lies in the field of church music. His particular forte was perhaps the verse anthem, a type of sacred vocal music for the Anglican rite that alternates &#145;full&#146; and &#145;solo&#146; choral groupings with organ accompaniment. His madrigals do not depart significantly from this &#145;serious&#146; idiom and seem to avoid the Italianate influences that had been so prominent in the work of the previous generation led by Thomas Morley. His main contribution to the various instrumental repertories was undoubtedly in the realm of stylized dance music, especially the pavan and galliard. This music was clearly for private purposes, a fact reflected in the relatively narrow distribution of manuscript sources, mostly emanating from the west country (with which the composer maintained lifelong associations).<br>
<br>Tomkins's son <a name="cosubject_27513"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Tomkins</span>  (1599&#150;1681), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and musician</span>, was born in Worcester and studied at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating BA on 20 April 1619 and proceeding MA on 3 February 1622 and BD on 13 March 1629. On 15 May that year he was appointed canon of Worcester Cathedral by Bishop William Laud, for whom he had apparently acted as an agent against Bishop John Williams of Lincoln. In his <span class="italic">Memorial</span> (1693) of Williams, John Hacket claimed that:<blockquote>Mr N. T., a musician and a Divine&#151;one that could make better music upon an organ than upon a text &hellip; had leave to use the whole [of Williams's] house, to go into the bishop's bedchamber, or study &hellip; [he] transcribed some letters which he found and sent them to an enemy [Laud]. (Vining)</blockquote>Tomkins became rector of St Martin's, Worcester, in 1633 and of Broadway, Worcestershire, in 1637. Ejected in 1646, he was sequestered before 1650. Restored to St Martin's in 1660, he also became rector of Todenham, Gloucestershire, that year and of Upton upon Severn from 1663. He was probably the editor of his late father's <span class="italic">Musica Deo sacra</span> (1668), of which he was inspecting proof sheets as early as 1665. None of his own music survives. He died at Martin Hussingtree on 20 October 1681.<br>
<br>Thomas Tomkins's half-brother <a name="cosubject_27510"></a><span class="headword">John Tomkins</span>  (1586&#150;1638), <span class="occ">organist</span>, was born at St David's. A scholar of King's College, Cambridge, he served as organist there from 1606 to 1619, and graduated MusB on 6 June 1608. He later served as organist of St Paul's Cathedral (1619), gentleman-extraordinary of the Chapel Royal (1625), and gentleman ordinary of the chapel (1627). He was appointed organist of the Chapel Royal for the state visit to Scotland in 1633 (jointly with his brother Giles). Married, he was father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27516/', "Thomas Tomkins (1637/8&#150;1675)")</script>. He died in London on 27 September 1638, and was buried in St Paul's. References to John (as Thomalin) are found in the poetry of Phineas Fletcher, a contemporary at King's; an elegy on his death by William Lawes appeared in the latter's <span class="italic">Choice Psalmes</span> (1648).<br>
<br>John's brother <a name="cosubject_27509"></a><span class="headword">Giles Tomkins</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1587, <em>d.</em> 1668), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was also born at St David's. Organist of King's College, Cambridge, between December 1624 and June 1626, he was thereafter master of the choristers at Salisbury Cathedral (1629), musician for the virginals in the king's musick (1630), organist with the Chapel Royal during the Scottish visit of 1633, and musician for lutes, viols, and voices (from at least 1641). His court appointments, which were all renewed at the Restoration, were held concurrently with his duties at Salisbury, where he seems to have been mainly living in the 1660s. He was buried there on 4 April 1668. By his will dated 20 March and proved on 24 May by his eldest son, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1631), he left legacies to his three sons and two daughters from his first marriage, his second wife, Elizabeth, and their son William, and his organ books to Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>The third son of the elder Thomas Tomkins's second marriage, Robert Tomkins (<i>b</i>. after 1587, <i>d</i>. in or after 1641), viol player and composer, was appointed musician for the consort of the king's musick on 28 March 1628. He was listed in the lord chamberlain's accounts for 1630 (with a salary of &pound;46 per annum) and with his brother Giles was one of the musicians for lutes, viols, and voices from 1641. Probably he died during the Commonwealth, since the Restoration account books make no further reference to him, naming in his place Henry Hawes. All that remains of his musical output are three verse anthems, although the texts for five others survive in the Chapel Royal anthem book.<br>
