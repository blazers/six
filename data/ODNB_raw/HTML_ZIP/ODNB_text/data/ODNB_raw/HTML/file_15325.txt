</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kemble,  Roger</span>  (1722&#150;1802), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Hereford on 1 March 1722, the son of Roger Kemble, a tolerably prosperous barber, respected in Hereford despite the family's Roman Catholicism and rumoured Jacobite sympathies. The Father John Kemble who was executed in 1679 for suspected complicity in the Popish Plot was probably the barber's great-uncle. Nothing, beyond the fact that she had at least four children, is known of the elder Roger Kemble's wife, and it is only supposition that his parents were opposed to the younger Roger's decision, in 1752, to abandon the barber's trade for the stage.<br>
<br>Kemble's first known engagement was with a company based in Canterbury, where he soon formed a liaison with the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64340/', "Elizabeth (Fanny) Furnival (fl. 1731&#150;1752)")</script>. Although she called herself Mrs Kemble (sometimes Campbell), it is unlikely that the couple married, and they were anyway separated when Kemble joined a Warwick-based company under the management of John Ward. The details of the whirlwind romance between the thirty-year-old Kemble and the manager's tall and handsome daughter Sarah (1735&#150;1807) are obscure. According to Jane Williamson, drawing on unpublished family memoirs, they eloped  (Williamson, 12). They were certainly married in Cirencester on 6 June 1753. Sarah was seventeen, headstrong and in love, and her father, however angry, was sufficiently fond (as well, perhaps, of her acting talent as of herself) to receive the young couple back into the company. The probability is that Kemble was a lesser actor than his wife, and that the theatrical dynasty they founded owed more to her than to him. The first five of their twelve children were born between 1755 and 1761, while they were touring with John Ward's company, and their various birthplaces (Brecon, Prescot, Kington, Hereford, Warrington) record a theatrical itinerary. Briefly, from 1761 to 1763, the Kembles set up a touring company of their own, but they were with Ward again from 1763 to 1766, when Ward retired and Kemble took over the management.<br>
<br>For the next fifteen years the Kemble company toured, predominantly in the Worcester region and along the Welsh border, straying occasionally into Wales. The playwright, novelist, and radical Thomas Holcroft, who was with the company in 1771&#150;2, and whose novel <span class="italic">Alwyn</span> draws on the experience, describes a travelling company of comedians as &#145;a small kingdom, of which the manager is the monarch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Thomas Holcroft</span>, 93), but his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> acknowledges that the Kemble company &#145;was more respectable than many other companies of strolling players&#146;. Even so, &#145;it was not in so flourishing a condition as to place the manager beyond the reach of the immediate smiles or frowns of fortune&#146;  (ibid., 90). It is doubtful whether Kemble would have been able to retire in 1781, having sold his theatrical stock and interests to John Boles Watson, had it not been for the prospect of future support from his two eldest children, soon to be famous as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25516/', "Sarah Siddons")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15322/', "John Philip Kemble")</script>. His daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45853/', "Ann Julia Hatton")</script> became an actress and writer.<br>
<br>The marriage of Kemble and Sarah Ward seems to have been a harmonious one, despite the fact that he was Catholic and she protestant. Their sons, it was agreed, would be brought up in their father's faith, and their daughters in their mother's. All the evidence suggests that the children retained love and respect for their parents and did their best to ensure that their retirement would be a comfortable one. Kemble was at Drury Lane on 10 October 1782 to see Mrs Siddons triumph as Isabella in Garrick's adaptation of Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">The Fatal Marriage</span>, and dined with her after the performance, as she gushingly recalls in her <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>:<blockquote>My Father enjoyed his refreshments, but occasionally stop'd short, and laying down his knife and fork, and lifting up his beautiful and venerable face, which was partly shaded by his silvered hairs hanging about it in luxuriant curls, let fall such abundant showers of delicious tears, that they actually poured down into his plate. (Kelly, 20)</blockquote>On 26 August 1788, for the benefit of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15326/', "Stephen Kemble's")</script> wife at the Haymarket Theatre, Kemble came out of retirement for his only known London performance in a forgotten trifle called <span class="italic">The Miller of Mansfield</span>. Outshone as an actor by most of his children, he was staunchly supported by his wife. James Boaden, who visited the Kembles in their old age at their cottage in Kentish Town, was informed by Sarah that her husband was &#145;the only <i>gentleman</i> Falstaff that I have ever seen&#146;  (Boaden, 1.6). He recalls Kemble, his silver curls covered by a quaint silken cap to protect him against catching a cold, as a man of great polish and exquisite manners.<br>
<br>Basking in the reflected glory of his eminent elder children, Kemble had applied for, and been granted, a coat of arms in 1792, no longer a strolling player but a gentleman. He died on 6 December 1802 in John Philip Kemble's grand house at 89 Great Russell Street. It is not known where he was buried, but a letter from John Philip Kemble (who was in Madrid when his father died) to his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15316/', "Charles Kemble")</script> agreed that &#145;his remains should be protected by a simple stone; but I beg that in the plain memorial inscribed on it, his AGE may be mentioned. Long life implies virtuous habits, and they are real honours&#146;  (Boaden, 2.367). In a will dated 14 January 1802 he left his stocks, his household goods, his money out on mortgages, and his five renter's shares in the Drury Lane Theatre Royal to his widow, with instructions on the disposal of the property to their surviving eight children after her death. Sarah died on 24 April 1807 and was buried at the church of St Marylebone on 29 April.<br>
