<span class="headword">Aston, Sir  Richard</span>  (1717&#150;1778), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was a younger son of Richard Aston, of Wadley, Berkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Warren, of Oxfordshire. The Astons derived their name from Aston in Cheshire, where the family had been settled since the time of Henry II. Brother of Sir Willoughby Aston of Aston, the fifth baronet, Richard Aston was born in Berkshire, and educated at Winchester College from 1728. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1736, and was called to the bar there in 1740. Little is known about his early years at the bar, but his success is testified to by his being named king's counsel in 1759. He was one of three defence counsel for Mary Blandy, tried for murder in 1752, and he assisted Serjeant Davy as appointed counsel in 1755 to defend the notorious Stephen Macdaniel and other members of his gang.<br>
<br>In 1761 Aston was made chief justice of the court of common pleas in Ireland on the resignation of Sir William Yorke. In this office he displayed considerable energy. He attempted to reform the disreputable practice of grand juries finding true bills of indictment upon the mere perusal of depositions without examining any witnesses, but only two of nine fellow judges supported him. The practice remained unaltered until parliamentary action was taken in 1816. Few English judges were popular in Ireland, and Aston was not one of the few. Accordingly he solicited a transfer, and in 1765, on the resignation of Sir Thomas Denison from the king's bench in England, Aston relocated to the English court and was knighted. In 1768 Aston was a member of the court presided over by Lord Mansfield which unanimously decided that the writ of outlawry issued against John Wilkes upon his conviction for publishing two seditious libels, in no. 45 of the <span class="italic">North Briton</span> and in the <span class="italic">Essay on Woman</span>, was bad by reason of two formal defects. The judges disallowed all the objections urged by the counsel for Wilkes, but a careful study by the junior members of the court (Sir Joseph Yates, Aston, and Edward Willes) revealed that, according to precedent, the name of the county where the county court sat was required to be stated at two specific places in the sheriff's writ, and the writ being faulty in these respects, the court held it invalid. A decision based upon a ground so purely technical, overlooked by counsel for the petitioner, and discovered by the judges only after diligent research, excited in the minds of those hostile to Wilkes suspicions of impropriety. A report circulated to the effect that the judges, or at least Willes and Aston, had been bribed by a gift of lottery tickets, that Aston had been seen selling them on Change, and had remarked that he had as good a right to sell his tickets as his brother Willes.<br>
<br>In 1770, on the sudden death of Charles Yorke immediately after his acceptance of the office of lord chancellor, Lord North's administration could not persuade Lord Mansfield to leave king's bench to take up the chancellorship and determined to place the great seal in commission. Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe of exchequer, Sir Richard Aston of king's bench, and the Hon. Henry Bathurst of common pleas were selected as commissioners. Despite Smythe's earlier service as a commissioner in 1756&#150;7, they had little chancery experience, and perhaps little aptitude for their roles. Their execution of their commissions incurred severe criticism and lasted only a year, at the end of which Bathurst, despite his perceived deficiencies, was named lord chancellor and Aston and Smythe returned full time to their former duties. It was by Aston, sitting with Lord Mansfield at Westminster in 1777, that sentence of fine and imprisonment was passed on John Horne (afterwards Horne Tooke) for a seditious libel in advertising a subscription in relief of the widows and orphans of American revolutionists.<br>
<br>According to Cradock, Aston was:<blockquote>always considered as a very sound Lawyer; friendly to those he liked, but rather rough in manners; he had a kind of dry humour about him, that in company engaged attention, and in an evening frequently enlivened his friends with many pleasant anecdotes. (Cradock, 1.85)</blockquote>He was not intimidated by his superiors. Lord Eldon told of an application to Aston for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, made after Lord Mansfield had perceived political sensitivity in the matter and refused the writ. Aston reportedly issued the writ directly, stating:<blockquote>what is [it] to me, one of his Majesty's Judges, that the Man, who has imprisoned this Fellow is Solicitor to the Revenue, or that his Master is Attorney General? He is the King's subject, and he must not be illegally confined for one Moment. (<span class="italic">Anecdote Book</span>, 158)</blockquote>Aston was characterized by John Nicholls as &#145;a man of sound sense&#146;, who tried causes &#145;with strict integrity&#146;, and &#145;though, perhaps, he had not that store of legal learning, which was possessed by his three colleagues &hellip; his decisions were generally right&#146;  (Nicholls, 1.340).<br>
<br>Aston was married twice, first to a Miss Eldred of the Haymarket in London, and then to Susanna, daughter and coheir of Thomas Witherstone of Burghill in Herefordshire, and widow of Sir David Williams, bt, of Gwernyfed. There were no children from either marriage. He died on 1 March 1778 and was buried in the chapel of Lincoln's Inn.<br>
