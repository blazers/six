<span class="headword">O'Hanlon,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Lageniensis]</span>  (1821&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and hagiographer</span>, was born in Stradbally, Queen's county, on 30 April 1821, the son of Edward and Honor Hanlon of Stradbally, who wanted him to become a priest. He went to a private primary school in Stradbally and then, aged thirteen, to an endowed school at Ballyroan. In 1840 he went to the ecclesiastical college at Carlow, staying there until May 1842, when he emigrated with some relatives to Quebec, Canada; in August he moved to Missouri in the United States. In 1847 he was ordained by Peter Richard Kenrick, archbishop of St Louis, and he spent the next few years as a missionary priest to Irish communities in Missouri. He later published <span class="italic">Life and Scenery in Missouri</span> (1890), an account of his experiences in America. In September 1853 he returned to Ireland because of ill health. From 1854 to 1859 he was assistant chaplain of the South Dublin Union, and from 1854 to 1880 curate of St Michael's and St John's, Dublin. In May 1880 he became parish priest of St Mary's, Sandymount, co. Dublin, where he remained until his death. In 1886 he was made a canon and in 1891 he returned briefly to the USA for the golden jubilee of Archbishop Kenrick.<br>
<br>O'Hanlon dedicated himself to Irish ecclesiastical history, and especially to research into the lives of the Irish saints. In 1856 he was elected a member of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society, and he was also a member of the Royal Irish Academy. While still a curate he visited nearly all the important libraries of England and southern Europe in order to pursue his research and in 1856 he began to collect material for his great work, <span class="italic">The Lives of the Irish Saints</span>. The first volume appeared in 1875, and nine further volumes and part of a tenth were published before his death. He was also a prolific contributor to Irish reviews and newspapers, and his published works include <span class="italic">Abridgment of the History of Ireland from its Final Subjection to the Present Time</span> (1849), <span class="italic">The Irish Emigrant's Guide to the United States</span> (1851), <span class="italic">The Life of St Laurence O'Toole, Archbishop of Dublin</span> (1857), <span class="italic">The Life of St Malachy O'Morgair, Bishop of Down and Connor, Archbishop of Armagh</span> (1859), <span class="italic">The Life of St Dympna, Virgin Martyr</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Catechism of Irish History from the Earliest Events to the Death of O'Connell</span> (1864), <span class="italic">The Life of St Grellan, Patron of the O'Kellys</span> (1881), and <span class="italic">Irish-American History of the United States</span> (1902). Under the pseudonym Lageniensis he also published verse, including <span class="italic">Legend Lays of Ireland</span> (1870), <span class="italic">Irish Folk-Lore: Traditions and Superstitions of the Country, with Numerous Tales</span> (1870), <span class="italic">The Buried Lady: a Legend of Kilronan</span> (1877), and <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of Lageniensis</span> (1893). He edited Monck Mason's <span class="italic">Essay on the Antiquity and Constitution of Parliaments of Ireland</span> (1891) and Molyneux's <span class="italic">Case of Ireland &hellip; Stated</span> (1893). O'Hanlon died at 3 Leahy's Terrace, Sandymount, co. Dublin, on 15 May 1905, and was buried at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, on 17 May.<br>
