<span class="headword">Wheeler <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Doyle]</span>,  Anna</span>  (1785?&#150;1848), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, born in co. Tipperary, Ireland, was the daughter of Anna Dunbar and her husband, Nicholas Milley Doyle, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and prebendary of Fennor parish in co. Tipperary. She did not have a formal education but learned French, geography, and skills of repartee from foreign dignitaries visiting her military relatives and gained political insights from her godfather, Henry Grattan. Clever, forthright, and not suffering fools gladly, Anna Doyle was a &#145;reigning beauty of the Irish countryside&#146;  (Sadleir, 71). In 1800, despite her mother's opposition, she married Francis Massy Wheeler (1781&#150;1820), a wealthy squire from Ballywire, co. Limerick. She spent her unhappy marriage reading the works of Diderot, Holbach, Condillac, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Mary Hays. Exhausted by marital acrimony, in 1812 Wheeler decided to leave her alcoholic husband. With her daughters, Henrietta and Rosina, and her spinster sister Bessie, she sailed to the island of Guernsey, where her uncle General Sir John Doyle (1750&#150;1834) was governor.<br>
<br>In Caen in 1816, with followers of Henri Saint-Simon, founder of &#145;French socialism&#146;, Wheeler's philosophical acumen and patronage to young intellectuals titled her the &#145;Goddess of Reason&#146;  (Sadleir, 76) and &#145;most gifted woman of the age&#146;  (ibid., 79). When her estranged husband died in 1820, Wheeler went to London, where she formed close relationships with men of liberal ideas, such as the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham, the charismatic co-operative leader Robert Owen, and William Thompson, the Irish political economist, feminist, and critic of capitalism.<br>
<br>Living in Paris in 1823, Wheeler met Charles Fourier, the French utopian socialist and a frequent visitor to Wheeler's salon; she dedicated herself to disseminating Fourier's ideas among London Owenites. To Fourier most of Owen's disciples seemed like pedants beside the exuberantly eclectic Anna Wheeler; she translated Fourier's writings on human harmony to make his turgid philosophy accessible, while using her diplomatic skills to mediate competitive disputes between Fourier and Owen. Wheeler stayed in France until 1826, and became a supporter of Greek independence in collaboration with Marc Antoine Jullien, the Pestalozzi educationist and Owenite follower. Wheeler returned to London after her daughter Henrietta died tragically from a &#145;wasting disease&#146;. She was absent from a public gathering on 6 May 1827 at the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Philotechnique de Paris, where Marc Antoine Jullien read his eulogy praising the mother&#150;daughter loyalty of Wheeler and Henrietta.<br>
<br>In 1825 collaborative work between Wheeler and William Thompson resulted in the <span class="italic">Appeal of One Half the Human Race</span>, a challenge to utilitarians who looked for universal happiness but excluded women, half the human race. The <span class="italic">Appeal</span> is a seminal statement, combining elements of liberal and socialist feminism; it exposes the misogyny in James Mill's invented fiction that women and men share an &#145;identity of interests&#146;, a fiction Mill used to justify the exclusion of women from the suffrage in his <span class="italic">Essay on Government</span> (1820). Wheeler brought a woman's reasoning and experience to the <span class="italic">Appeal</span>, a role affectionately acknowledged by Thompson in an introductory &#145;Letter to Mrs Wheeler&#146;. Only a few pages of the text were written exclusively by Wheeler but Thompson considered the text their &#145;joint property&#146;  (<span class="italic">Appeal</span>, vii). Intertextual comparisons with Wheeler's other writings indicate the passages written by her pen alone. An example would be the searing critique of marriage so central in the <span class="italic">Appeal</span>. A graphic portrayal of domestic, economic, and psychic causes of human oppression are balanced against a proposal for an alternative life of co-operative community living where gender justice might be possible.<br>
<br>Wheeler adopted the pseudonym Vlasta when publishing controversial essays in the Co-operative Press on such subjects as women's enslavement to a learned ideology of romantic love, which concentrates their thoughts on pleasing male sensuality. An 1829 lecture at Finsbury Square on &#145;Rights of women&#146; shows that Wheeler decried the social conditioning of men by corrupt institutions, but she aimed always to promote harmony between the sexes rather than adversarial rancour, to plead the cause of men in advocating the rights of women. Her articles stressed the need for women to act on principles and reason, liberating themselves from a captivity to uncritical social custom and conditioning; such views were encouraged by Wheeler's women friends among Saint-Simonians and Owenites, such as Frances (Fanny) Wright, Desir&eacute;e Veret, Jeanne Victoire, and Flora Tristan.<br>
<br>In May 1833 Wheeler wrote of her close friendship with the deceased William Thompson in a eulogy signed Vlasta and read to friends of co-operation at Lord Hampden's residence. Hampden admitted that no one knew Thompson better than Anna Wheeler, yet Thompson had determined never to marry within the unequal legal provisions constraining women. Wheeler's friends continued to try to arrange for her return to France before the 1848 revolution, but a crippling neuralgia forced her into seclusion. She died at 51 High Street, Camden Town, London, on 7 May 1848.<br>
<br>Wheeler's ideas on sexual equality were perpetuated by her daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17316/', "Rosina, Lady Bulwer-Lytton (1802&#150;1882)")</script>, who had two children, Emily Elizabeth (1828&#150;1848) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17315/', "Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton, first earl of Lytton (1831&#150;1891)")</script>. After a publicly acrimonious divorce from Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Rosina wrote <span class="italic">An Appeal to the Justice and Charity of the English Public</span> (1857), exposing the social ostracism women experience in defending their reputations against false allegations. Anna Wheeler would not have been surprised at this tragic turn of events, having never felt either affection or respect for Bulwer-Lytton. Wheeler's great-granddaughter Lady Constance Lytton (1869&#150;1923), third child of Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton, continued the line of prominent feminists, and collaborated with Emmeline Pankhurst in the Women's Social and Political Union, a group prepared to face prison to acquire the suffrage.<br>
