<span class="headword">Rundell,  Philip</span>  (1746&#150;1827), <span class="occ">jeweller and millionaire</span>, was born on 15 January 1746 and baptized on 8 February 1746 at Norton St Philip, near Bath, Somerset, one of the large family of Richard Rundell, victualler or maltster, and his wife, Ann Ditcher. Shortly after his fourteenth birthday, on 10 May 1760 Rundell was apprenticed in Bath to the jeweller William Rogers. After serving his time he found employment in the late 1760s, probably through the influence of family connections in the City of London, with William Pickett, the retail goldsmith of the Golden Salmon, Ludgate Hill. The youthful Rundell appears to have shown his aptitude for business so rapidly that within three or four years Pickett, admittedly increasingly preoccupied by aldermanic affairs on his way to becoming lord mayor in 1789, made him a partner. Rundell was made free of the Drapers' Company by redemption on 15 May 1771.<br>
<br>The firm of Pickett and Rundell survived until February 1786, when Rundell, taking sole charge, agreed to buy Pickett out. In December the following year the firm's name was altered from Philip Rundell to Rundell and Bridge upon John Bridge becoming the new partner. Under these two men the concern became pre-eminent in the British goldsmiths' trade. For nearly forty years they formed what seems to have been the perfect working partnership, each attending to that part of the business to which their very different characters suited them best. Rundell, hard-working, often irascible, and steadfast in striking a bargain, and also regarded by London contemporaries as the keenest judge of diamonds, superintended the firm's jewellery and other manufacturing departments. Bridge, on the other hand, was possessed of an urbanity of manner which proved of the greatest importance, especially in the firm's dealings with George III and other members of the royal family.<br>
<br>About 1798 Rundell arranged to purchase the old-established jewellery business of John Duval, Sons &amp; Co.; by this means Rundell and Bridge became the crown jewellers. A further change occurred in 1804&#150;5 when the firm's style was altered to Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell following the admission of the senior partner's nephew, Edmund Waller Rundell (1768?&#150;1857), son of Maria Eliza Rundell, into the business. By now Rundells was in a dominant position with many of the finest workshops, including that of Paul Storr, at its disposal, together with the services of artists such as William Theed, John Flaxman, and Thomas Stothard. Besides a stock of both new and antique silver, much of Rundells' business depended upon the sale and purchase of precious stones, pearls, jewellery, gold boxes, and objects of virtu. By 1812&#150;13 Rundell was furthermore actively engaged in buying a steam engine for a diamond-cutting subsidiary in Spitalfields.<br>
<br>Although never married, according to the article on him in the <span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary</span> for 1828 Rundell<blockquote>always manifested much pleasure in the enjoyment of female society, for which the comeliness of his person, his conversational powers, and his habitual attentiveness, naturally fitted him. He was unassuming in his manners, and when relieved from the cares of business, was a cheerful and agreeable companion. He was fond of music, had a tolerable voice, and sang with taste. (p. 323)</blockquote>During the last twenty years of his life, however, he suffered from increasing deafness and the effects of an internal complaint, in consequence of which &#145;he withdrew much from society, and lived very retired&#146;  (p. 324). Other, less charitable accounts of Rundell's character, conduct, and the acquisition of his great personal wealth have survived, the more unpleasant of which, perhaps significantly, were written by former employees.<br>
<br>Rundell retired on 29 September 1823. Throughout most of his working life he lived above the shop at 32 Ludgate Hill, although latterly he occupied a house nearby in The Crescent, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars. On his retirement he took up residence in a small house at South Bank, Regent's Park, in order, according to one authority, to be near his medical advisers. Others claim that this was the abode of Rundell's mistress, Mrs Elizabeth Wartridge. His health began to deteriorate seriously towards the end of 1826 and he died at South Bank on 17 February 1827. He was buried in Hendon parish churchyard, the grave being marked by a stone tomb erected in his memory by Joseph Neeld junior.<br>
