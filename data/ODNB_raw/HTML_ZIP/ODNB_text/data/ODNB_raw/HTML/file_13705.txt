<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hooper,  George</span>  (1640&#150;1727), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells and scholar</span>, was born on 18 November 1640 at Grimley, Worcestershire, the son of George Hooper, of a lesser landed gentry family, and his wife, Joan, daughter of Edmund Giles of White Ladies Aston, Worcestershire. The Hoopers were royalist, but the Giles family was parliamentarian by inclination&#151;Hooper's uncle became a master in chancery under Cromwell.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Hooper was educated briefly at St Paul's School, London, and then from about 1653, as king's scholar, at Westminster School. Richard Busby, the headmaster, well known for his exacting standards, thought highly of him: &#145;the boy is the least favoured in features of any in the school, but he will be the most extraordinary of any of them&#146;  (Cassan, 2.172). Later he described Hooper as &#145;the best scholar, the finest gentleman and will make the completest bishop that was ever educated at Westminster&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Here Hooper first learned Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic, which were to be for him a lifelong pursuit. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1657 as a scholar, graduated BA in 1660, and became a don. He proceeded MA in 1663, BD in 1673, and DD in 1677. He now not only developed into a competent classical and mathematical scholar, but under Edward Pococke, the leading Arabist of his day, Hooper also became a notable oriental linguist. He played his full part in college life, while in the university he deputized for the public orator, and in 1669 for both Thomas Willis, Sedleian professor of natural philosophy, and John Wallis, Savilian professor of geometry. During that year he also wrote a mathematical treatise which interested Nicholas Mercator. A recently discovered brass Gunter quadrant, made by him and bearing his inscription, confirms his proficiency in that field. He was still writing to Robert Hooke about quadrants in 1676. Already a multifaceted academic, Hooper had also been ordained deacon on 23 December 1666 and priest early in 1668 by Walter Blandford, bishop of Oxford.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Apart from his scholarly work Hooper's career for thirty years after 1670 followed two other intertwining paths&#151;as cleric and as royal confidant. In 1670 George Morley, bishop of Winchester, invited him to be his chaplain and a year later rector of Havant. But the damp there soon so affected his health that his fellow chaplain Thomas Ken, destined to be a close friend and colleague for the next forty years, vacated East Woodhay, Hampshire, in his favour in November 1672. As incumbent there until 1691 and assisted by a competent curate, he earned an exemplary reputation as parish priest. In fact, Isaac Milles, incumbent at nearby Highclere, always admired him: he was &#145;the perfect gentleman, the thorough scholar and the venerable and skilful divine&#146;  (Milles, 92&#150;3). His time as Morley's chaplain, however, ended abruptly. Hooper's daughter, Abigail Prowse, records how Archbishop Sheldon cajoled Morley into releasing him to be his chaplain at Lambeth. Nevertheless letters of autumn 1672 emphatically suggest otherwise. Morley, a staid bachelor, was so appalled at the possibility of Hooper's marriage to a Winchester woman that he determined to be rid of him, and persuaded the primate to promote him.<br>
<br>Consequently in 1673 Hooper went to Lambeth as Sheldon's chaplain. This was to be a key moment in his career. In October 1675 the primate likewise offered him the rectory of St Mary, Lambeth, which he held until 1703. Here Hooper was much respected, and the church underwent major refurbishment. In the long run this move to Lambeth paid handsome dividends, for it introduced Hooper to London's exceptionally gifted clerical circle&#151;the future archbishops Tillotson, Tenison, Wake, and Sharp were his fellow incumbents&#151;whose spirituality, scholarship, and dedicated pastoral care provided a &#145;luminous interlude&#146;, a &#145;Small Awakening&#146; in the church  (Rupp, 51). Significantly, Hooper's move introduced him to the royal family. Circumstantial evidence suggests he may even have joined Gilbert Burnet's discussions with Tsar Peter the Great at Lambeth in 1698.<br>
<br>In spring 1678 Bishop Compton of London chose Hooper to succeed William Lloyd at The Hague as almoner to Princess Mary, recently married to William III of Orange. He was to preserve Mary's Anglican faith from Dutch Calvinist contagion, an essential task because Mary seemed likely to inherit the English throne. More punctilious than Lloyd, whom several contemporaries suspected of letting her attend English Congregationalist meetings at The Hague, Hooper provided suitable reading matter, including Eusebius and Hooker, and a chapel complete with Anglican furnishings which Mary used twice daily. William jibbed at these fripperies and frostily kicked the altar steps, asking what they were for and, when told, &#145;he answered with a hum&#146;  (Prowse, 5). Later he showed his disapproval: &#145;Well, Dr. Hooper, you will never be a bishop&#146;  (ibid., 6). On 2 May 1679 Hooper married Abigail Guilford (1654/5&#150;1726), daughter of Richard Guilford, a notable Lambeth brewer. Soon after his marriage, in October 1679, he left for England. Ken succeeded him.<br>
<br>Hooper's contacts with royalty developed further. In 1681 he became chaplain to the king. In 1685 James II asked him to accompany the duke of Monmouth with Tenison, Ken, and Lloyd the night before his execution. Hooper talked privately with the duke, solely to prepare him for death, and was one of the four who witnessed his declaration of illegitimacy. As Monmouth was to die the next morning Hooper &#145;thought it teasing rather than necessary&#146; to try to get a confession of rebellion from him  (Prowse, 9). All were with the duke the next morning on the scaffold.<br>
<br>Ken, now bishop of Bath and Wells, was Hooper's guest in 1688 during the trial of the seven bishops and during the Convention Parliament the following spring. One night Hooper almost persuaded Ken to swear allegiance to William and Mary, but eventually they agreed to differ. Though a high-churchman, Hooper took the oaths. Nevertheless his relations with William were at best cool, but he remained on close terms with Mary and her sister, Anne. Though clearly in line for a bishopric, Hooper's fortunes only changed after William's death in 1702.<br>
<br>In 1677 Hooper had been appointed precentor of Exeter Cathedral, a post he held until 1704. His spells of duty, though infrequent&#151;once every two or three years&#151;were lengthy, up to three months. By the standards of the day he certainly fulfilled his role, and often presided at chapter meetings in the dean's absence. Then in 1691, during William's absence abroad, Mary hastily appointed him dean of Canterbury, much to the king's later irritation. Regular in attendance at chapter meetings, unlike at Exeter, he masterminded extensive cathedral refurbishment. Significantly he was often host to William and Mary&#151;and after Mary's death in 1694 to William alone&#151;when they were <i>en route</i> for the Netherlands.<br>
<br>In 1701 Hooper achieved notoriety as prolocutor of the lower house of the revived convocation, a position where Ken hoped he would take a lead in church affairs. This predominantly high-church body set out to thwart the upper house, presided over by Archbishop Tenison. In the ensuing dispute Hooper displayed not only competence, but combative and high-handed belligerence in defying the primate. His actions momentarily earned Atterbury's acclamation, but once the session was over Hooper returned to his usual restraint. He not only joined Henry Aldrich in writing <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Lower House of Convocation</span>, less strident than Atterbury's pamphlets, but he refused to stand for re-election as prolocutor for 1702. To a disgusted Atterbury this was treachery; he heaped vitriolic abuse upon him. Hearne later branded him as &#145;a Complyer&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Bishop"></a>Bishop</h2>With William dead and Anne queen, Hooper's relationship with Robert Harley, the speaker and now the mainspring of ecclesiastical preferments, became more intimate. This soon yielded fruit. In 1703, after reluctantly accepting and being consecrated to the impecunious Welsh see of St Asaph on 31 October 1703, he was nominated to the more prestigious bishopric of Bath and Wells in succession to Richard Kidder. At first he refused, hoping that Ken, the nonjuring bishop deprived in 1689, would return to the see, now that both William III and the &#145;usurping&#146; Kidder were dead. But Ken, already in poor health at Longleat, approved of Hooper as one &#145;most able and willing to preserve the Depositum&#146;  (Plumptre, 2.141) and agreed to cede the bishopric to him. Ken no longer signed himself &#145;Thomas Bath and Wells&#146;, thereby personally acknowledging the cession to Hooper  (LPL, MS 2872, fols. 76 and 78). Though extreme nonjurors felt a sense of betrayal, Hooper was enthroned by proxy on 3 April 1704. In later years Ken visited Hooper at Wells.<br>
<br>Hooper was a conscientious pastor of his diocese. He conferred orders, usually at least twice every year, on fifty-five occasions, all in the diocese. Even in June 1727, shortly before his death, he ordained nine priests and three deacons. He was meticulous but considerate over ordinands' academic standards; only 14 of the 369 he ordained were non-graduates. An underachiever would return home for further study, encouraged by &#145;guineas in his pocket to subsist on&#146;  (Prowse, 34). The few visitation records that remain show that he fulfilled visitations regularly throughout his episcopate, and in his use of patronage he normally gave benefices only to those from within the diocese. A competent administrator, he pursued rights over episcopal manors, broke down nepotism in the cathedral chapter and defended the rights of the College of Vicars. His relationships with recusants, nonjurors, and rationalists, such as Whiston, were not only firm, but humane and tolerant. One incumbent, Thomas Coney, writing soon after Hooper's death, recorded that he was always accessible to his clergy: each &#145;had the favour of a son, the access of an equal and the reception of a friend&#146;  (Coney, appendix, 31).<h2>
<a name="Thescholar"></a>The scholar</h2>Above all Hooper was a scholar&#151;linguist, mathematician, and theologian&#151;with an insatiable thirst for all types of knowledge. Noted as such by Busby at Westminster, and also at Oxford, he earned applause from many quarters. Reportedly he refused the regius professorship of divinity in 1680. Twells, Pococke's biographer, claimed that Hooper had no superior in &#145;piety, extent of learning and every good quality that could adorn a bishop, a gentleman or a scholar&#146;  (Twells, 273). Ken, who wrote a poem in his honour, regarded him as one of the most eminent intellects he knew, who could do &#145;excellent service to our sinking church&#146;  (Marshall, 95). As an ecclesiastical lawyer, linguist, and theologian, he could hold his own against the best in the country, but he was far from being a dilettante.<br>
<br>Hooper's use of Arabic was significant throughout his life. Using it to help solve problems in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, he was still actively working with Arabic in the 1720s when he was over eighty years of age. He was then buying and annotating recently printed books in Arabic, a psalter and <span class="italic">The Life and Activities of the Prophet Mohammed</span>. Furthermore, his study of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 49, published at his request after his death, but first conceived before 1681, owed much to his Arabic. Mathematics was still an active interest then too. As late as 1721, at the age of eighty, he published <span class="italic">An Enquiry in to Ancient Weights and Measures, the Attic, the Roman and the Jewish</span>. The library of almost 300 books he bequeathed to Wells Cathedral confirms his remarkable breadth of interest. Besides books in Latin and Greek, tools usual for a scholar, there are many in Arabic, including some on medicine. There are also books in Hebrew, annotated by him, Syriac, Anglo-Saxon, even a <span class="italic">Grammatica Russica</span>, and books on optics and astronomy.<br>
<br>Apart from two brief poems written in 1660, Hooper's first publications did not appear until the 1680s. These related to the major uncertainty of the day, the threat from Rome&#151;<span class="italic">The Church of England Free from the Imputation of Popery</span> (1682), <span class="italic">The Infallible Guide</span> (1689), and the <span class="italic">Credibility of Human Testimony</span> (1699). Other academic studies followed: <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Lent</span> (1695), <span class="italic">De Valentinianorum haeresi conjecturae</span> (1711), and <span class="italic">De benedictione patriarchae Jacobi Gen. XLIX conjecturae</span>. Though Hooper was no Romanist, scholarly enthusiasm drew him into friendly contact with Catholic academics in France. His study of the origins of the Benedictines caught the attention of the order, especially the congregation of St Maur in Paris, among whom were Bernard Montfaucon and Edmond Mart&egrave;ne, with whom he corresponded and whose books he possessed. Likewise he corresponded with a French Jesuit, Tournemaine, to whom latterly he sent a copy of each work as it was published. Other writings included <span class="italic">The Parson's Case under the Present Land Tax</span> (1689) and his <span class="italic">Narrative of the Proceedings of the Lower House of Convocation</span>.<br>
<br>Hooper had a notable reputation as a preacher. John Evelyn, who often heard his sermons, regarded him as &#145;one of the first rank of pulpit men in the nation&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.260). Of the eight sermons Hooper published, probably the most notable was that preached in St Paul's on 7 July 1713 to celebrate the end of the war. In this he supported the contemporary tory policy of peace. Later, when the Hanoverian succession hung in the balance, he preached a sermon on 13 June 1714, significantly anti-Roman in tone. Two manuscript volumes of other sermons still exist.<h2>
<a name="Politics"></a>Politics</h2>Politically Hooper was no enthusiast. In the turbulence of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries he was a moderate, at most a reluctant, politician. Hearne's accusations of trimming are unjust, for Hooper was more interested in his scholarship and his diocese; but in politics, so far as it concerned him, he was a pragmatist. Though no admirer of William and close in his thinking to Ken, Hooper's pragmatism persuaded him to swear allegiance to the joint monarchs. In the 1690s his intimacy with Harley, the rising country tory, was the source of mutual support. Indeed the two had several clandestine discussions on a boat in mid-river. In 1701 as prolocutor he found himself miscast as a hostile, pugnacious assailant of the whig episcopal bench, a role totally foreign to him. As soon as he could, he withdrew from such exposure. In 1702 Godolphin had vetoed Rochester's nomination of him as primate of Ireland&#151;Hooper then lacked the necessary episcopal experience&#151;but it was Harley who was instrumental in his elevation to the episcopate in the following year. Though initially Hooper was punctilious in attending the Lords&#151;he voted for the second <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> (1703)&#151;he soon displayed a prickly independence, much to the irritation of Godolphin and Harley. He defected, voting and speaking more with the high tory opposition over such matters as &#145;the Church in Danger&#146; and Scottish union. From 1707 his Lords attendance declined dramatically. Refusing repeated requests from Weymouth and, after 1710, from Harley, now earl of Oxford, he rarely attended the Lords. In fact, a lack of political enthusiasm, combined with his refusal to answer frequent government calls for support in the Lords, cost him the prestigious sees of both London and York. Nevertheless, as problems with the succession to Anne grew larger, he adhered once more to Oxford, still a friend, and began to attend more regularly. In speech and sermon he solidly supported the Hanover tories in their peace strategy in Europe and for a Hanoverian succession in England. Had he been prepared to involve himself more politically, he would indeed have scaled greater ecclesiastical heights in the service of the &#145;sinking church&#146;, as Ken had envisaged.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Hooper was primarily a scholar and a diocesan bishop. Believing in political moderation and pragmatism, he was a man of consistency, moral rectitude, and humanity in an age of turbulence and change. Of his nine children only two survived childhood. Rebecca, the younger daughter, died aged twenty, but the elder, Abigail, who married John Prowse of Axbridge, survived to write the &#145;memorandums&#146; on her father's life. Hooper died at Berkeley, Gloucestershire, on 6 September 1727, a year after his wife. He was buried in Wells Cathedral ten days later alongside her and their younger daughter. A memorial was erected in the cloister.<br>
