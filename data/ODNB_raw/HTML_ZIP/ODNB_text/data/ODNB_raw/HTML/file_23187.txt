<span class="headword">Rawlins,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1670), <span class="occ">engraver, medallist, and playwright</span>, is of unknown origin. Best known for his skills and services as an engraver, he initially made his name as a playwright in 1640 when he published <span class="italic">The Rebellion</span>, a tragedy set in Seville, which he dedicated to Robert Ducie of Aston, Staffordshire, a relative. The title was to prove prophetic, since it was during the &#145;great rebellion&#146; that he achieved prominence as an engraver and medallist. This occupation commanded his full attention, and it is not known when the two comedies published after his death were written. <span class="italic">Tom Essence, or, The Modish Wife</span> was licensed to be performed at Dorset Gardens on 4 November 1676 and printed in 1677, and <span class="italic">Tunbridge Wells, or, A Day's Courtship</span> was printed in 1678. A series of poems entitled <span class="italic">Calanthe</span> of 1648, signed &#145;T.R.&#146;, are attributed to him, and he also wrote verses to introduce Nathaneal Richards's <span class="italic">Tragedy of Messallina</span> and Richard Lovelace's <span class="italic">Lucasta</span>.<br>
<br>Rawlins is believed to have served as an apprentice goldsmith and gem-engraver in London before taking employment at the royal mint working under Nicholas Briot, the renowned French engraver and medallist who went to England in 1626. His earliest known work is a medal of William Wade of 1641. At the commencement of the civil war the Tower mint came under the control of parliament. The king initially settled at Shrewsbury and, anxious to establish a mint, ordered Thomas Bushell to come up from Aberystwyth with all dies, puncheons, and machinery from that mint, which had been established in 1637 as a satellite to the Tower to coin the Welsh silver. After three months Charles I moved to Oxford, to which place members of the Tower mint loyal to him repaired: Thomas Rawlins was one and Sir William Parkhurst, warden of the mint, was another. On 3 January 1643 the equipment from Shrewsbury arrived at Oxford, where Rawlins was to do his best work. Plate, both gold and silver, was ordered in or voluntarily supplied by the king's adherents to be melted for coining. To accomplish this as expeditiously as possible, the largest denominations hitherto current in both gold and silver were struck. These were the gold triple unite (a &pound;3 piece) and the silver pound and half-pound pieces, all of which had initially been produced at Shrewsbury by Bushell.<br>
<br>Rawlins was appointed graver of seals, stamps, and medals at Oxford in 1643. While he was responsible for all denominations, his best works were the pound and crown of 1644, the former showing the king riding a spirited horse over arms and armour and his declaration in a cartouche on the reverse with the date below, and the latter showing the king riding over a view of the city of Oxford, the declaration within scrolls, the date in script, and &#145;OXON&#146; below. This fine piece, comparable to continental city thalers, has become known as the &#145;celebrated Oxford crown&#146;. Rawlins was appointed chief engraver at the Tower and elsewhere in 1645.<br>
<br>Rawlins also produced medals and badges at Oxford, significant being the gold Shrewsbury medal commissioned on 23 January 1643 for award to a select few who had afforded considerable support to the king while he was there. The obverse depicted the conjoined busts of Charles I and Charles, prince of Wales, and was used again to produce the &#145;forlorn hope badge&#146;, which was commissioned on 18 May 1643, taking the form of a uniface silver clich&eacute; with holes pierced near its edge to enable it to be stitched to the tunics of all who served in that body. By a commission of 1 June 1643 it finally formed the obverses of the gold medals awarded to Captain Sir John Smith and Lieutenant Sir Robert Welch for their retrieval of the royal standard at Edgehill: the reverses were named to the recipients. Rawlins produced a medal for the reunion of the king and queen at Kineton on 13 July 1643 and the &#145;peace or war medal&#146;, showing an olive branch and sword crossed, on the fall of Bristol to Prince Rupert on 26 July. In 1644 he produced a portrait medal of Sir William Parkhurst, showing him holding one of Rawlins's civil war badges. Rawlins produced a series of badges which were cast and chased and may have been awarded for acts of valour or merely made for wear by the king's supporters.<br>
<br>Oxford surrendered on 24 June 1646. Little is known of Rawlins's movements during the next year or so, but he surfaced to produce badges and medals in memory of Charles I. It seems he then went to France, but he did return to England and is known to have been imprisoned for debt. At the Restoration he was restored as chief engraver, with appropriate lodgings, and produced a medal for the coronation. Thomas Simon, however, was responsible for the great seal and the hammered coinage of the first two years and was himself eclipsed by John Roettier, who was responsible for the milled coinage introduced in 1662 and most of the subsequent medals. Rawlins's incarceration for debt is thus perhaps explained by a seeming lack of employment during the interregnum.<br>
<br>Little is known of Rawlins's private life other than that he married Dorothea Narbona. He died in 1670, presumably in London. His signature was variously &#145;T. Rawlins&#146;, &#145;T.R.&#146;, or &#145;R.&#146;. The last has caused confusion because it was also the signature of David Ramage, an engraver to the Commonwealth, who produced a number of farthing tokens and was known as the farthing maker.<br>
