<span class="headword">Bindoff,  Stanley Thomas <span class="st"> [Tim]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1980), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at 13 Stirling Place, Hove, Sussex, on 8 April 1908, the son of Thomas Henry Bindoff, a barman, later described as a licensed victualler's manager, and his wife, Mary Jane Emma Ball. Educated at Brighton grammar school under a great history master, A. E. Wilson, he went on to University College, London (UCL) in 1926, when J. E. Neale was about to succeed A. F. Pollard. After graduation, he kept the wolf from the door as a research assistant, a professional indexer, and as history tutor to the future King Farouk of Egypt. In 1935 Bindoff joined the staff of University College, and with the outbreak of war followed the department to north Wales, where he lived among the slate quarries and <span class="roman">Bible</span>-black chapels of Bethesda, later acknowledging the hospitality of its &#145;kindly folk&#146;. There followed three years with the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty. On 18 April 1938 he married Marjorie Blatcher (1906/7&#150;1979), Pollard's research assistant, an authority on the technicalities of legal history. At the age of forty-two, Bindoff confessed that he had enjoyed &#145;a career remarkable chiefly for its uneventfulness&#146;. The thirty years of life which remained were not so much eventful as filled with selfless service. In 1951 Bindoff was appointed the first professor of history at Queen Mary College in the Mile End Road, London, where his impact was great. He became a statesman in the complex affairs of the University of London. Bindoff remained at Queen Mary College until retirement, after which he continued to live in Surbiton, which makes a suitably undramatic terminal point.<br>
<br>In 1950 Bindoff published his <span class="italic">Tudor England</span> in the <span class="roman">Pelican History of England</span> series. Since he is remembered as a Tudor historian, it might be thought that, Elisha-like, he had simply taken on the Pollard&#150;Neale mantle. But the truth was more interesting. University College had engaged the services of the greatest Dutch historian of his generation, Pieter Geyl. Under Geyl's supervision Bindoff wrote an MA thesis, &#145;Great Britain and the Scheldt, 1814&#150;1839&#146;, based on research in Dutch and Belgian archives, as well as in the papers of Lord Palmerston. Harold Temperley was another influence. In 1945 the Dutch government sponsored the publication of <span class="italic">The Scheldt Question to 1839</span>, which traced this long-running diplomatic issue from its beginnings in the fourteenth century. The book was dedicated to Geyl, with whom Bindoff had co-operated in translating <span class="italic">The Netherlands Divided</span> (1936), part of his <span class="italic">Geschiedenis van de Nederlandsche stam</span> (1934). <span class="italic">The Scheldt Question</span> is spoken of with respect, so that it is distressing to report that it was first borrowed from the Cambridge University Library in February 1998.<br>
<br>The fate of <span class="italic">Tudor England</span> was different. It was a runaway success. And here we detect the influence of R. H. Tawney, for Bindoff had used his Tudor special subject teaching  (reflected in Tawney and Power, <span class="italic">Tudor Economic Documents</span>) to strengthen his credentials as an economic and social historian, at a time when social history was still a literary, and humane, pursuit. So <span class="italic">Tudor England</span> was more a history of the English people than of the English state, and its epicentre was a chapter which analysed the interactive economic and social crises of the 1540s, a time as pregnant with change for the Englishman's getting and spending as the 1530s were for his governance and creed. Elsewhere he put into the mouths of the Norfolk farmers who made the so-called Ket's rebellion of 1549, and who lay in their mass grave at Dussindale, this <i>prosopopeia</i>: &#145;What sort of people do they think we were? We who lie here were honest, sober, sturdy folk, having God and the commonwealth before our eyes.&#146; Bindoff was a man of conservative inclinations, but this was a book redolent with the values of Clement Attlee's England. It was also saturated in the language of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (and of Shakespeare), although the Bindoffs had married in a register office.<br>
<br>Bindoff never wrote another book. In 1978, at seventy, the editors of his Festschrift (<span class="italic">Wealth and Power in Tudor England</span>) counted twenty-nine published items, not including a modest batch of reviews. The books which Bindoff never wrote were his postgraduate students, with whom he spent countless hours, in seminars (in 1952 Bindoff detached himself from the Neale seminar and began to preside over his own), in the tea-room of the Institute of Historical Research, and often in the pubs of Store Street. The pipe, the gruff and slow-moving voice: these were what laboriously animated the most important experience of their lives for many of these pupils.<br>
<br>Bindoff's later years were dominated by the <span class="roman">History of Parliament</span>, a gazetteer of members and constituencies of the House of Commons. Bindoff was the editor of the section covering the parliaments of 1509&#150;58, and the three stout volumes which appeared in 1982 were published in his name. Once again, Bindoff's massive learning was modestly concealed rather than displayed. He wrote no general introduction, and while his personal input to all of the biographical essays was considerable (and one of the last things he did was to read the proofs), he appended his initials to only nine of the 2263. One of these subjects was Thomas Cromwell, but the remaining eight were MPs so obscure that even their very names are in doubt. Either no other member of the team wanted, or was trusted, to handle these hard cases; or, more plausibly, Bindoff took characteristic pleasure in the sublimely pointless task of establishing the real identity of Edward Lloyd, or Floyd, or Powell, or Sooll, the MP for Buckingham in 1529. Students were told that that was what history was all about. However, Bindoff called the <span class="roman">&#145;H. of P.&#146;</span> &#145;the monkey on my back&#146; and regretted that he never wrote the ambitious books projected, on Antwerp and on the international economics of early modern northern Europe.<br>
<br>Bindoff fell ill with bronchopneumonia in the winter of 1980 and died on 23 December at 24 Langley Avenue, Surbiton, Surrey, survived by a son and a daughter.<br>
