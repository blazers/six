<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cameron,  Katharine</span>  (1874&#150;1965), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and etcher</span>, was born on 26 February 1874 at 16 Sardinia Terrace, Hillhead, Glasgow, the eighth of the nine children of Robert Cameron (1825&#150;1898), minister of Cambridge Street United Presbyterian Church in Glasgow, and his wife, Margaret Johnston (<i>bap</i>. 1839, <i>d</i>. 1924), elder daughter of Donald Robertson, a surgeon in Perth, and his wife, Jessie. Although she was baptized Catherine, she spelt her name Katharine, signing her paintings K. Cameron or KC. She was a younger sister of the distinguished painter and etcher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32256/', "Sir David Young Cameron")</script>. Both inherited their artistic ability from their mother, a talented amateur watercolourist.<br>
<br>Cameron attended the Glasgow School of Art intermittently from 1889 to 1901, which was then under the inspired direction of Francis Newbery. She was a member of a small circle of female students who called themselves The Immortals. Other members included the sisters Margaret and Frances Macdonald, the former marrying the architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, a fellow student of Cameron in the early 1890s. In 1902 she studied at the Acad&eacute;mie Colarossi in Paris.<br>
<br>Apart from her etching, Cameron worked exclusively in watercolour. By the age of twenty she had achieved considerable maturity in terms of technique and composition. In 1897 she was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, then a remarkable achievement for a woman of twenty-two. Her early paintings are predominantly flower pieces. However, inspired by the Celtic revival and by the work of Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and the Hague school painter Matthijs Maris, whom she met on several occasions, she also executed a number of romantic figure studies, illustrating characters or incidents from Scottish ballads and folklore. Landscapes feature in her work after 1900. She had the same love of the highlands as her brother, always striving to capture their magical beauty.<br>
<br>In 1902 Cameron illustrated a book for children titled <span class="italic">In Fairyland</span>, the first of a number of such commissions. Her watercolour illustrations are varied and colourful, but are&#151;with a few exceptions&#151;unremarkable. She had little real commitment to illustration. What inspired her most was painting flowers; at her best her work is exemplary, combining acute observation with a sensitive painterly technique.<br>
<br>Cameron began etching in 1898, but did not take it up seriously until 1911, when her first set of eight etchings of flowers was published. She went on to etch about seventy-three plates over the next twenty-five years. The majority are of flowers and/or insects, the remainder being landscapes. They are characterized by a strong, yet sensitive line. She was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1920, becoming a fellow in 1964.<br>
<br>A prolific artist, Cameron painted with barely diminished vigour into her eighties. She was an assiduous exhibitor throughout her life, showing for the first time at the Royal Glasgow Institute in 1891 at the age of seventeen. She had a joint exhibition with her brother in London in 1897 and held the first of many solo exhibitions in 1900.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1928 Cameron married, as his second wife, the collector <a name="cosubject_62823"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Kay</span>  (1861&#150;1939)<span class="occ"></span>, whom she had known for many years. He was born at 11 Whittingham Villas, Studley Road, Clapham Road, London, on 11 November 1861, the son of John Robert Kay, a merchant, and his wife, Eliza Perks. Kay joined his father on the board of Arthur &amp; Co. Ltd, the major Glasgow wholesale warehousing firm, in 1887. Educated at Rossall School and Glasgow University, he was a very cultured man with a wide range of interests. A true connoisseur and a discriminating collector, he devoted the whole of his leisure time to art for almost sixty years. He was one of the first in Britain to recognize the true worth of the impressionists, at one time owning Degas's <span class="italic">L'absinthe</span> (Louvre Museum, Paris). He died at his home, 11 Regent Terrace, Edinburgh, on 1 January 1939.<br>
<br>In her younger days Cameron was petite, pretty, and vivacious, but she became rather stout in later life. She was noted for her distinctive clothes. Friends remembered her as a kind person who was very supportive of young artists. She died at 3 Marshall Crescent, Edinburgh, on 21 August 1965 after a fall.<br>
