<span class="headword">Oldcorne,  Edward</span>  (1561&#150;1606), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in York, son of John Oldcorne, a bricklayer, and his wife, Elizabeth. He abandoned medical studies and went to the continent to study for the Roman Catholic priesthood. He arrived at the English College, then situated in Rheims, on 12 August 1581. On 23 February 1582 he was sent to the English College in Rome and was ordained priest in the Lateran on 23 August 1587. On 15 August 1588 he and John Gerard entered the Society of Jesus. Dispatched almost immediately for England, they arrived in Rheims on 21 September and departed for England via Eu on the 26th. Surveillance at English ports increased because of the Armada so the two paused at Eu to decide on their next move. They left Eu in late October or early November and landed in East Anglia in late November. Oldcorne set off immediately for London to establish contact with Henry Garnet, superior of the English Jesuits.<br>
<br>In early spring 1589 Oldcorne accompanied Garnet on a missionary tour of the midlands and remained in Warwickshire upon Garnet's return to London. By spring of either 1589 or 1590 (the sources are unclear), he was residing at Hindlip House near Worcester, seat of the ancient Catholic family of Habington. There he remained, labouring zealously as a missioner, making many converts, and placing many clergy with recusant families. One of the most important was the reconciliation of Dorothy Habington, according to Thomas Lister SJ, &#145;a very obstinate and perverse heretic&#146; who did all she could &#145;to keep, or rather to drive away Catholic priests from the house&#146; because she blamed them for her brother Edward's destruction in the Babington plot. With her assistance Hindlip House became &#145;the most famous house in England for entertainment of priests&#146;. Oldcorne was a popular preacher and Lister testified that he had &#145;seen oftentimes more people come from his sermons than from the service of the Protestant minister on Sundays from the parish church&#146;  (Foley, 4.214&#150;15). Of his activity John Gerard said: &#145;he founded and governed nearly all the domestic churches in those parts&#146;  (ibid., 4.212).<br>
<br>Humphrey Littleton, imprisoned on a charge of harbouring some of the conspirators after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, sought to save his own life by informing the privy council that Oldcorne was at Hindlip and that Garnet most likely would also be found there. The search began on 20 January 1606: Nicholas Owen and Ralph Ashley were discovered on the 23rd, and Garnet and Oldcorne on the 27th. Oldcorne was incarcerated first in the Gatehouse and later in the Tower, where he was tortured. He persistently denied all knowledge of the plot. Sent from the Tower to Worcester on 21 March, he was arraigned at the Lenten assizes on three charges: that he had invited Garnet, a denounced traitor, to hide at Hindlip; that he had asked the assistance of fellow Jesuit Robert Jones in Herefordshire in concealing two conspirators, consequently making himself an accomplice; and that he had considered the plot a good action. Oldcorne was found guilty of high treason, and on 7 April 1606 he was drawn on a hurdle to Red Hill, near Worcester, and there hanged, disembowelled, and quartered. His body was destroyed. Littleton, who suffered at the same time, publicly asked pardon of God for having wrongfully accused Oldcorne of the conspiracy. Oldcorne was beatified on 15 December 1929.<br>
