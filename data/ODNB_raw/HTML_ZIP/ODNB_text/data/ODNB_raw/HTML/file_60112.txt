<span class="headword">Allen,  Walter Ernest</span>  (1911&#150;1995), <span class="occ">novelist and literary scholar</span>, was born on 23 February 1911 at Aston, Birmingham, the youngest of the four children, all sons, of Charles Henry Allen (<i>fl</i>. 1870&#150;1950), silversmith's designer, and his wife, Annie Maria Thomas. His father's family came from the Staffordshire Black Country and his mother's from Wales, but he did not know either of his grandfathers, who died before he was born. Allen grew up in a working-class home in Birmingham; his father, a skilled craftsman, was a man with wide interests who encouraged his son's aspirations, despite material hardships. Allen was a clever child with a gift for writing, who won scholarships to King Edward's Grammar School, Aston, and subsequently to Birmingham University, where he read English. He graduated in 1932 at a time of high unemployment, but scraped a living by contributing articles, stories, and reviews to the several newspapers then published in Birmingham. He also wrote radio scripts for the midland region of the BBC, laying the foundations of his later career as a broadcaster.<br>
<br>Allen became a close friend of Louis MacNeice, then a young lecturer in classics at Birmingham University, and came to know W. H. Auden and Henry Green and local writers such as John Hampson, Peter Chamberlain, and Leslie Halward. In 1935 Allen's horizons were broadened when he went to the United States as a visiting lecturer at the summer session of the University of Iowa. As a young man, his father had spent some months in America in an unsuccessful attempt at emigration, and he fascinated his son with accounts of the country. Allen continued this fascination throughout his own life; he came to know the United States well and was never able to regard it as &#145;abroad&#146;. Back in Birmingham he returned to journalistic work, this time as part of a two-man news agency. But he had higher literary ambitions; he wrote a novel which remained unpublished (the typescript is in his papers at Birmingham University Library), but his next novel, <span class="italic">Innocence is Drowned</span> (1938), was accepted for publication by Michael Joseph. On the strength of this success, Allen moved to London to become a man of letters. He managed narrowly to survive by writing book reviews and reports for publishers, and making summaries of novels for an American film company, which he described as the lowest form of literary life.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Innocence is Drowned</span> attracted some respectful reviews when it appeared but sold few copies. It, and its successors, <span class="italic">Blind Man's Ditch</span> (1939) and <span class="italic">Living Space</span> (1940), draw on Allen's experience of working-class life in Birmingham and his own hopes and disappointments as a socially mobile scholarship boy. They also show his interest in literary form, in the careful development of narrative and the treatment of time. In <span class="italic">Blind Man's Ditch</span> Allen seems to be presenting his young self as the precocious schoolboy Arnold Hipkiss: &#145;an undersized boy with solemn horn spectacles, like a wise owl&#146;  (W. Allen, <span class="italic">Blind Man's Ditch</span>, 1939, 218)&#151;&#145;[t]here wasn't any subject that he could not write about&#146;  (ibid., 226).<br>
<br>Allen spent the war years as a technical writer in armaments factories, first in Bristol and then in his native Birmingham. On 8 April 1944, after a three-week courtship, he married Peggy Yorke Joy (<i>b</i>. 1915), a physiotherapist serving with the Red Cross; he wrote &#145;Marrying her was far and away the wisest thing I have ever done&#146;  (Allen, 146). They had four children. During the war years Allen contributed regular literary essays to the widely read periodical <span class="italic">Penguin New Writing</span>. As he ruefully acknowledged, they made him known as a critic rather than as a novelist; modestly, he preferred to describe himself as a literary journalist. At the end of the war Allen and his wife returned to London and he picked up the threads of his literary career. He made an adequate but precarious living as a freelance writer, reviewer, and publisher's adviser; his most regular work was as a radio broadcaster on literary and cultural topics. Between 1948 and 1960 Allen and his family lived first in Kent, on Romney Marsh, and then in Devon before he returned to London, where he lived for the rest of his life. During those years he published a succession of books on the novel and novelists, including studies of George Eliot and Arnold Bennett. Allen's most enduring and best-known book is <span class="italic">The English Novel</span> (1954), which provides a lucid, well-informed, and critically perceptive history of the subject from Bunyan to Lawrence and Joyce.<br>
<br>Allen continued to write novels himself, and <span class="italic">All in a Lifetime</span> (1959) has been generally admired; in this novel Allen returns to working-class Birmingham and traces the life and times of his father, from the 1870s to the 1950s. Between 1959 and 1961 he acted first as assistant literary editor and then as literary editor of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. Looking back on his career, Allen recognized that his traditional kind of literary journalist was being replaced by critics based in universities. He made his own forays into the academic world as a visiting professor in North American colleges and universities and came to think of himself as a &#145;transatlantic man&#146;. His survey of British and American fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, <span class="italic">Tradition and Dream</span>, was published in 1964. Allen entered the academy full-time in 1967 when he was appointed founding professor of English at the New University of Ulster, where he served until he retired in 1973.<br>
<br>In 1975 Allen was physically disabled by a severe stroke, but his mental powers were unaffected and he continued to write. His memoir of his literary life, <span class="italic">As I Walked Down New Grub Street</span> (1981), is light-hearted and informative. In 1989 he published his last novel, <span class="italic">Accosting Profiles</span>, more than fifty years after his first; it draws on his experience of British and American universities.<br>
<br>Walter Allen died at his home, 4B Alwyne Road, London, on 28 February 1995 of bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular accident. His funeral and cremation took place at Golders Green crematorium early in March 1995.<br>
