<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  John</span>  (1765&#150;1846), <span class="occ">physician and surgeon</span>, was born at Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 15 March 1765, the son of Joseph Thomson, a silk weaver, and his wife, Mary, formerly Millar. At the age of eleven Thomson was bound apprentice to his father for seven years. His father destined him for the ministry; the boy, however, wished to study medicine, and persuaded his father to apprentice him in 1785 to Dr White of Paisley, with whom he remained for three years. He entered the University of Glasgow in the winter session of 1788&#150;9, and in the following year migrated to Edinburgh. He was appointed assistant apothecary at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in September 1790, and a year later he became house surgeon to the institution under the designation of surgeon's clerk, having already from the previous June filled the office of an assistant physician's clerk. He became a member of the Medical Society at the beginning of the winter session in 1790&#150;91, and in the following year he was elected one of its presidents. On 31 July 1792 Thomson resigned his appointment at the infirmary on account of ill health, and went to London, where he studied at John Hunter's school of medicine in Leicester Square.<br>
<br>In London, Thomson made many valuable friendships, and on his return to Edinburgh early in 1793 he became a fellow of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and attended the Royal Infirmary as a surgeon. He married, in 1793, Margaret Crawford, second daughter of John Gordon of Caroll, Sutherland. She died early in 1804; of their three children only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27329/', "William Thomson (1802&#150;1852)")</script>, physician, survived him.<br>
<br>During this period Thomson was occupied with the study of chemistry. He conducted a chemical class during the winter of 1799&#150;1800 which met at his house, under the auspices of the earl of Lauderdale, and consisted chiefly of gentlemen connected with the parliament house. In 1800, nominated one of the six surgeons to the Royal Infirmary, he began teaching surgery. He also lectured on the nature and treatment of those injuries and diseases familiar to military surgeons, and he visited London in the autumn of 1803 to be appointed a hospital mate in the army in order to qualify himself, should it be found necessary to establish a military hospital in Edinburgh in the event of an invasion.<br>
<br>The College of Surgeons of Edinburgh established a professorship of surgery in 1804, and, in spite of objections from the university, Thomson was appointed to the post. In 1806 he was appointed regius professor of military surgery in the University of Edinburgh, but he continued to hold the college professorship until 1821. Also in 1806 Thomson married Margaret, third daughter of John Millar (1735&#150;1801), professor of jurisprudence at Glasgow University. Of their children, only a daughter and a son, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27291/', "Professor Allen Thomson (1809&#150;1884)")</script>, biologist, reached adulthood.<br>
<br>On 11 January 1808 Thomson obtained the degree of MD from the University and King's College of Aberdeen. In 1810 he resigned his post at the Royal Infirmary following criticism of his surgery by the surgeon John Bell. He continued to lecture, however, and in the summer of 1814 he visited the various medical schools in Europe to examine the different methods followed in the hospitals of France, Italy, Austria, Saxony, Prussia, Hanover, and the Netherlands. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh on 7 February 1815, since he was by then acting as a consulting physician as well as a consulting surgeon. In the following summer Thomson again returned to the continent to watch the treatment of the men wounded at Waterloo, and in September 1815 he was mainly instrumental in founding the Edinburgh New Town Dispensary.<br>
<br>The smallpox epidemic of 1817&#150;18 showed that vaccination conferred less protection than had been supposed, and Thomson published his views upon the subject in two pamphlets of 1820 and 1822. He delivered a course of lectures on diseases of the eye in the summer of 1819, paving the way for the establishment of the first eye infirmary in Edinburgh in 1824. During 1822&#150;6 he was involved in the study of general pathology, and in 1821 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of the practice of physic in the university, rendered vacant by the death of James Gregory. In 1828&#150;9 and again in 1829&#150;30 he delivered a course of lectures on the practice of physic, both courses being given in conjunction with his son, William Thomson. In 1831 he addressed Lord Melbourne on the advantages likely to flow from the establishment of a separate chair of general pathology. He was appointed professor of general pathology in the university, commencing in 1832.<br>
<br>Thomson was a prolific writer and translator; among his major works <span class="italic">Elements of Chemistry and Natural History</span>, prefaced by &#145;Philosophy of chemistry&#146;, a translation of the work by Fourcroy (3 vols., 1798&#150;1800), reached a fifth edition; <span class="italic">Observations on Lithotomy, with a New Manner of Cutting for the Stone</span> (1808; with appendix, 1810) was translated into French; and <span class="italic">Lectures on Inflammation: a View of the General Doctrines of Medical Surgery</span> (1813) was issued in America in 1813 and 1817, and was translated into German in 1820 and into French in 1827. The lectures were founded on the Hunterian theory of inflammation which was later modified.<br>
<br>Repeated attacks of illness compelled Thomson to discontinue his visits to patients after the summer of 1835, but he continued to see those who came to his house. He resigned his professorship in 1841. The duties had long been performed by a deputy. He died at his home, Morland Cottage, near the foot of Blackford Hill, on the south side of Edinburgh, on 11 October 1846.<br>
<br>Thomson died with the reputation of being in his time the most learned physician in Scotland. &#145;To almost the last week of his life he was a hard student&#146;, says Henry Cockburn in his journal,<blockquote>and not even fourscore years could quench his ardour in discoursing upon science, morals, or politics. &hellip; He never knew apathy, and, medicine being his first field, he was for forty years the most exciting of all our practitioners and of all our teachers. (<span class="italic">Journal of Henry Cockburn</span>, 163&#150;4)</blockquote>
