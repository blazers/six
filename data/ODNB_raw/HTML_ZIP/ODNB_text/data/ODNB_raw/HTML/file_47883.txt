<span class="headword">McCrindle,  John Ronald</span>  (1894&#150;1977), <span class="occ">lawyer and airline executive</span>, was born on 29 November 1894 at The Grange, Middlesbrough, the only child of James Ronald McCrindle MB CM, physician and surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Pullan Kealabow, both of Scots descent. He was brought up in Kingston, Jamaica, where his father was in practice. Following early education at Jamaica College, he went on to Glasgow University to study medicine. In August 1914&#151;not yet qualified&#151;he was gazetted a second lieutenant in the territorial brigade of the Gordon Highlanders, and seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in November 1914. For the next four years, as a pilot in France, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Palestine, he was three times mentioned in dispatches, awarded a Military Cross in 1917, and ended the war as a major in the Royal Air Force.<br>
<br>In December 1918 McCrindle was posted to command 1 (communications) flight, RAF, formed on 13 December to operate regular, daily, air services between London and Paris for the peace conference at Versailles. Appointed OBE in November 1919 and fluent in French, he was posted for special duties with the British delegation on the council of ambassadors in Paris. On 26 December 1921 he married in New York, Odette, the daughter of Joseph Fuller Feder. Early the following year he retired from the RAF, and joined the Harvard business school, from where he graduated in 1924. Called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1927, McCrindle practised at the chancery bar until 1934. He kept his links with aviation through the London Aeroplane Club at Stag Lane, where he owned and flew a DH Cirrus Moth. He returned to work in aviation in 1932 as legal adviser to the small, independent Hillman bus company at Romford, Essex, from where in April 1933 he and Edward Hillman initiated a London (Maylands) to Paris (Le Bourget) air service with the first DH Dragon aircraft, at fares of &pound;3 10<i>s</i>. single and &pound;5 10<i>s</i>. return. When Edward Hillman died, aged only forty-five, on 31 December 1934, McCrindle became managing director of Hillman's Airways and, supported by his second wife (the writer Susan Ertz, whom he had married on 6 August 1932, following his divorce from Odette), he negotiated the absorption by Hillman's Airways of three other small airlines, Spartan, United, and British Continental, forming a new company known as British Airways, to compete with Imperial Airways on the London to Paris and Brussels air routes, and on to Cologne, Hanover, Stockholm, and the Western Isles in 1936.<br>
<br>In April 1937 the enterprising British Airways began fast (one hour twenty minutes) services between London and Paris, flying new American Lockheed Electra monoplanes, in competition with the two and a quarter hours of Imperial Airways. Following the 1938 Cadman inquiry into the operation of British air transport, the airline was granted increased services into Europe, and the pioneering of scheduled British air services to South America.<br>
<br>Operating the advanced American Lockheed aircraft, British Airways was chosen in September 1938 to fly the prime minister to and from the Munich meetings with Hitler. In April 1940 it merged with Imperial Airways to form the state-owned British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), with Sir John Reith as chairman, and McCrindle as deputy director-general. Already, in 1945, he had been in the lead in forming the post-war International Air Transport Association in which, with BOAC, for the next twelve years he was an active and respected representative in London, Montreal, Chicago, and Bermuda.<br>
<br>McCrindle retired in 1969, but continued to enjoy contacts with his wide circle of friends throughout the world of air transport. He and his wife entertained with flair and enjoyment at their country house, Lossenham Manor, near Hawkhurst in Kent, where McCrindle was described by a leading American diplomat as, &#145;A British gentleman of the first order&#146;. In addition to his Military Cross and OBE, McCrindle became a CMG in 1948, and received numerous honours from abroad. He suffered a stroke and died at his home on 12 March 1977.<br>
