<span class="headword">Maltby,  William</span>  (1763&#150;1854), <span class="occ">bibliographer and librarian</span>, is said to have been born in London on 17 January 1763  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), though his baptism was not recorded until 13 February 1765 at the Old Jewry Presbyterian Church. He was the youngest of ten children of Brough Maltby (<i>bap</i>. 1719), wholesale draper of Mansion House Street, London, and Ann Dyer. The Maltbys came originally from Norwich, where several were elders of the Presbyterian church. Edward Maltby, bishop of Durham, was a first cousin, as was John Dyer Collier  (Dyce, 300), father of John Payne Collier, the editor and literary forger. Through the Brough family he was related to Thomas Secker, archbishop of Canterbury. Maltby was educated under the Revd James Pickbourne at Grove Street, Hackney, where he formed a lifelong acquaintance with the poet Samuel Rogers, a fellow pupil; he is frequently mentioned in Archibald Dyce's <span class="italic">Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers</span> (1856).<br>
<br>Maltby entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, but as a dissenter did not take a degree. Here he was to acquire the classical and literary tastes which lasted throughout his life. He was well versed not just in the classics, but also in the literature of France and Italy. On 23 June 1787 he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn, and practised as a solicitor in partnership with his brother, Rowland Maltby, clerk to the Fishmongers' Company (<span class="italic">Law Lists</span>). But literature was a greater lure than the law, and Maltby became a familiar figure in the literary circles of his day, particularly in company with Rogers.<br>
<br>Following the death in 1808 of Professor Richard Porson (whom he had known socially for more than twenty years), Maltby was on 1 February 1809 appointed to succeed him as principal librarian of the London Institution. This was a society in the City for subscribers, modelled on the Royal Institution in the West End, and offered lectures, particularly on scientific subjects, and an extensive reference library. Porson was better known for his fondness for the bottle than for books, but Maltby was in his natural element there as a book lover. He assiduously attended the major book auctions and made many large additions to the library. By 1811 the institution (founded only in 1806) already held 12,000 volumes. He had an extraordinary memory and knowledge of books, and was a fount of wisdom on bibliographical matters. Visiting Rome in 1821 Rogers wrote: &#145;I never pass a bookseller's shop here but I think of M[altby]&#146;  (Clayden, 1.329).<br>
<br>Twice Maltby was responsible for the removal and rearrangement of the books. The first occasion was in 1811, when the institution moved from its original home in Old Jewry to King's Arms Yard, Coleman Street. These premises were always too small, and in 1819 the institution removed to a new building in the recently laid out Finsbury Circus. He assisted in the compilation of the original catalogue, printed in 1813, as well as in the first volume (1835) of the new edition. The institution grew slowly and suffered a number of crises in its management, but its heart was always the library, whose development into a major reference library was entirely due to Maltby's labours.<br>
<br>From the beginning the assistant librarian of the London Institution had been William Upcott, the autograph collector. When he was asked to resign in 1834 following unspecified complaints  (London Institution minute books), Maltby (then aged seventy-one) expressed his desire to retire at the same time if he could keep his apartments. This was granted, and he was awarded a pension of &pound;100 per annum. He died at the London Institution on 5 January 1854 and was buried at Norwood cemetery, where a memorial was erected by Rogers. He was unmarried. Although Maltby had a reputation for his willingness to communicate his great knowledge of books to others&#151;he was masterly at literary and classical quotations&#151;he never published a single book himself. His sole contribution to literature was his memoir of Porson, published as &#145;Porsoniana&#146; in Dyce's <span class="italic">Table-Talk</span>.<br>
