<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Goobey,  Alastair Ross</span>  (1945&#150;2008), <span class="occ">pension fund manager</span>, was born at 29 The Avenue, Wanstead, Essex, on 6 December 1945, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72071/', "George Henry Ross Goobey (1911&#150;1999)")</script>, pension fund manager, and his wife, Gladys Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Menzies (<i>b</i>. 1911). He was brought up in Clevedon, near Bristol, and educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied economics. A keen student actor, he met Sarah Georgina Mary Stille (<i>b</i>. 1949) in a production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>; she was a secretary, the daughter of Cedric Ernest Stille, a flower bulb importer. They married on 26 July 1969 and had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Ross Goobey's father, the in-house investment manager of Imperial Tobacco Company's pension fund from 1947 to 1975, was a legendary figure in fund management as the pioneer of the &#145;cult of the equity&#146;, the shift from government bonds to equities in the 1950s. Ross Goobey junior joined the merchant bank Kleinwort Benson, a leading City merchant bank, as a graduate trainee in 1968. Subsequently he worked for Hume Holdings (1972&#150;7), Courtaulds pension fund (1977&#150;81) as investment manager, and the investment boutique Geoffrey Morley and Partners (1981&#150;7) as a director. From 1987 to 1993 he held the relatively prominent post of chief investment strategist at the leading City stockbroker James Capel &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Ross Goobey became a high-profile financial figure as chief executive of Hermes Pensions Management, manager of the Post Office and British Telecom staff pension fund, from 1993 to 2001. Hermes was one of Britain's biggest institutional investors with sizeable holdings in many quoted companies. They provided Ross Goobey with an opportunity to pursue better corporate governance through institutional shareholder activism. Soon after his appointment he wrote to all the chairmen of FTSE 100 companies informing them that Hermes opposed three-year rolling contracts for chief executives, which ensured huge pay-offs regardless of performance. He was an early proponent of the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive and of greater corporate transparency, and took a dim view of directors remaining beyond normal retirement age. Hermes even opposed the re-election of Ross Goobey's septuagenarian father as chairman of a quoted property company. His ideas were taken up by official inquiries into corporate governance and incorporated into the <span class="roman">Combined Code</span> of 2003. &#145;It's quite difficult to argue with some of the things we suggest&#146;, he observed to the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> in 2002, &#145;such as the principle that we're not against people being paid well but please can they earn it first&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 9 Jan 2002). He was a founder and from 2002 chairman of the International Corporate Governance Network, which brought together shareholder activist investors from across the world. &#145;The big change is that companies are now listening to shareholders&#146;, he said. &#145;When we started this, they didn't even talk to shareholders&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 19 July 2001).<br>
<br>Like his father, Ross Goobey developed pension fund investment in new directions, especially commercial property, being &#145;one of the most forceful advocates of property as a financial asset&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 10 Nov 1994). From 1995 to 2004 he was president of the Investment Property Forum, a body that promoted commercial property to institutional investors. He wrote a monthly column in the <span class="italic">Estates Gazette</span> and was author of <span class="italic">Bricks &amp; Mortals</span> (1992), an account of the 1980s property boom and bust. His other book, <span class="italic">The Money Moguls</span> (1986), was a study of the investment management industry. He created the Hermes Focus Funds that invested actively in underperforming companies and helped to turn them round, and after retiring as chief executive of Hermes Pensions Management Ltd he continued as chairman of Hermes Focus Asset Management Ltd. He was much in demand as an adviser. He played a key role in the development of the investment strategy of the Wellcome Trust, the world's largest medical charity, of which he was a governor from 2002. He was a member of the council of Lloyd's (1997&#150;2003) and on the European advisory board of Morgan Stanley, where he was a senior adviser from 2002. Directorships included Scottish Life (1978&#150;86), Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society (1989&#150;91 and 1992&#150;7), TR Property Investment Trust (1994&#150;2004), and John Wainwright &amp; Co. (1997&#150;2008). From 2002 until his death he was a senior adviser at Morgan Stanley.<br>
<br>A free-market Conservative, Ross Goobey unsuccessfully contested the safe Labour seat of Leicester West in the general election of 1979. This brought him to the notice of Nigel Lawson, leading to stints as special adviser to chancellors Nigel Lawson in 1986&#150;7 and Norman Lamont in 1991&#150;2. He later observed that he was &#145;jolly glad&#146; he had not become a politician  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Feb 2008). His Whitehall experience led to several senior official appointments, including the Goode committee on pensions law (1992&#150;3), the Middleton committee on film industry finance (1995&#150;6), and the chairmanship of the private finance initiative panel (1996&#150;7). He was appointed CBE in 2000 for services to pensions; many City colleagues felt that he deserved a higher honour, particularly for his role in improving corporate governance.<br>
<br>Ross Goobey became known beyond the City through newspaper articles and as a panellist on seven series of BBC Radio 4's light-hearted business quiz, <span class="italic">The Board Game</span>. Interviewed on the <span class="italic">Today</span> programme in March 2003, during a stock market downturn, he correctly called the bottom and famously exhorted listeners to &#145;fill your boots&#146; with equities  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 6 Feb 2008). He was, in his own phrase, &#145;a card-carrying capitalist&#146; who admired successful entrepreneurship, though, observed an obituarist, &#145;he certainly had a puritanical streak, emphasized by an appearance that had something of the 19th-century Nonconformist preacher&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Feb 2008). He disclosed his own pay package, never claimed his lunch expenses, and turned down opportunities of more lucrative employment. &#145;I just think I missed out on the greed gene&#146;, he remarked  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Feb 2008). Nigel Lawson recalled in his memoirs that Ross Goobey &#145;never could resist a joke&#146;  (Lawson, 658).<br>
<br>Ross Goobey's recreations included club cricket, supporting Arsenal, and music. He played the piano and the clarinet, notably at the wedding of Clive James. Charitable and voluntary contributions included membership of the boards or investment committees of the Royal Academy of Music, the National Gallery, the National Opera Studio Foundation, and the Royal Opera House. CancerBACUP, the cancer information charity, was an active interest in acknowledgement of the help provided after his diagnosis of blood cancer in 1997. He was successfully treated, but died at his home, 22 Alwyne Road, Islington, from a recurrence, on 2 February 2008. He was survived by his wife, Sarah, and their two children.<br>
