<span class="headword">Tate,  Nahum</span>  (<em>c.</em>1652&#150;1715), <span class="occ">poet, playwright, and translator</span>, probably born in Ireland, was the second of the four sons of Faithful Teate (<i>c</i>.1627&#150;1665/6), and his wife, Katherine. The couple also had three daughters. Tate's father and grandfather (also called Faithful, (<i>d</i>. 1660)) were clergymen of puritan sympathies who had both attended Trinity College, Dublin, and had both held livings in Ireland and England. Tate's grandfather and his family were ill-treated, and his valuable property destroyed, in the Irish Catholic uprising of 1641. Tate's father was the author of seven published works, most notably <span class="italic">Ter tria</span> (1658), a long stanzaic poem in the metaphysical manner on the nature of the Trinity.<br>
<br>Nahum Tate and his brother (another Faithful) registered as students at Trinity College in June 1668. They had received their schooling under Henry Savage of Belfast, a Trinity contemporary of their grandfather. In his last undergraduate year Nahum was elected a scholar of Trinity, and graduated BA in 1672. By 1676 he had moved to London, where he soon established himself in literary circles. He lived there as a professional writer (with perhaps a brief period as a schoolmaster between 1687 and 1692) for the rest of his life. During the early 1680s Tate wrote committedly in support of Charles II, and initially welcomed James II's succession in 1685. But he seems to have become rapidly disenchanted with James's extreme pro-Catholic policies, and at the revolution of 1688&#150;9 transferred his allegiance to William III, whom he hailed as a pious peacemaker and defender of English liberty. After the death of Thomas Shadwell in 1692, on 8 December Tate was appointed to the poet laureateship, a position which he held for life.<br>
<br>Tate's poetic career began with a set of complimentary verses to the second edition (1676) of the <span class="italic">Poems</span> of Thomas Flatman. In 1677 he published his own collection of <span class="italic">Poems</span>: sixty-nine short pieces, including love lyrics, melancholy Flatmanesque reflections, and one poem (&#145;On the Present Corrupted State of Poetry&#146;) which provides early evidence of his pious tendencies. An expanded and revised edition of the collection, with many metrical and stylistic improvements, appeared in 1684. About 1680 Tate had made the acquaintance of two contemporaries who were to influence his career significantly: Charles Sackville, earl of Dorset, who soon became his patron, and who later, as lord chancellor, was to recommend his appointment to the laureateship, and John Dryden, with whom he soon became involved in several poetic projects. Tate wrote three versions from Ovid's <span class="italic">Heroides</span> for <span class="italic">Ovid's Epistles</span> (1680), a collaborative venture to which Dryden also contributed translations and a critical &#145;Preface&#146;. In 1682 he published complimentary poems to Henry Dickinson's <span class="italic">Critical History of the Old Testament</span> translated from the French of Richard Simon (the occasion for Dryden's <span class="italic">Religio laici</span>), to the third edition of Dryden's <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span>, and to Dryden's <span class="italic">The Medall</span>. In the same year, Tate and Dryden collaborated directly on <span class="italic">The Second Part of Absalom and Achitophel</span>, with Dryden supplying the portraits of &#145;Doeg&#146; (Elkanah Settle), &#145;Og&#146; (Thomas Shadwell), and &#145;Ben-Jochanan&#146; (Revd Samuel Johnson), and Tate writing most of the remainder, in close imitation of Dryden's original poem. Tate pursued his interest in translation with versions from book 7 of Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> (in the 1684 <span class="italic">Poems</span>) and a rendering of books 4 and 5 of Abraham Cowley's <span class="italic">Six Books of Plants</span> (1689). His apparent plans for further Ovidian translations in the early 1690s, which eventually bore fruit in versions of book 4 of the <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> (1697) and <span class="italic">The Speeches of Ajax and Ulysses</span> from book 13 (with Aaron Hill, 1708), seem to have provoked the rivalry of Dryden, who in a letter to his publisher Jacob Tonson of 3 October 1692, wrote of his intention to &#145;spoyl Tate's undertakings&#146; by speedily bringing out his own translation of &#145;The first book of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>&#146;. But relations between Tate and Dryden remained sufficiently cordial to allow Tate to contribute versions of satires 2 and 15 to the Dryden&#150;Tonson <span class="italic">Satires of Juvenal and Persius</span> (published November 1692; dated 1693), and to write, probably about the same time, the version of Ovid's <span class="italic">Remedia amoris</span> eventually included in <span class="italic">Ovid's Art of Love</span> (1709). Tate's translation <span class="italic">Syphilis, or, A Poetical History of the French Disease</span>, (1686), from the Italian of Girolamo Fracastoro, was reprinted in the third Dryden&#150;Tonson miscellany, <span class="italic">Examen poeticum</span> (1693).<br>
<br>As well as satire and translations Tate published a substantial amount of occasional and complimentary verse, including poems on Thomas Creech's <span class="italic">Lucretius</span> (1683) and John Oldham's <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1684), and celebrations of Sir Godfrey Kneller (1692), Henry Purcell (1698), and the grammarian Lewis Maidwell (1707). The bulk of his output from 1692, however, took the form of official laureate verse, mostly in the form of pindaric odes, often designed for musical setting, which celebrated monarchical achievements and anniversaries, lamented royal deaths, commemorated military victories, and applauded prominent public figures and events. The pressures of royal patronage and public duty were temporarily in abeyance during Tate's composition of <span class="italic">Panacea</span> (1700; revised, 1702), a relaxed mock-heroic poem on the origins and virtues of tea-drinking.<br>
<br>Tate's religious commitment became increasingly evident in his later years. He compiled an anthology, <span class="italic">Miscellanea sacra, or, Poems on Divine and Moral Subjects</span> (1696; revised, 1698, 1705), wrote to the bishop of London (6 February 1699) with proposals &#145;for Regulating of the Stage &amp; Stage-Plays&#146;, and published, from 1694, <span class="italic">A New Version of the Psalms of David, Fitted to the Tunes used in Churches</span> (first complete edition, 1696; revised version, 1698; supplement, 1700). The last, written in collaboration with Nicholas Brady, was intended to replace the Elizabethan versified psalter by Sternhold and Hopkins (1562), used regularly in Anglican worship as the equivalent of a hymnbook. The <span class="italic">New Version</span> was designed to achieve a modernity and elegance of idiom, while remaining compatible with the traditional psalm tunes. The Tate&#150;Brady <span class="italic">Psalms</span> were attacked for their inaccuracy and for &#145;light and airy&#146; modishness by Bishop William Beveridge in <span class="italic">A Defence of the Book of Psalms</span> (1710). Their poetical variety and liturgical practicality were immediately and vigorously defended by Tate in <span class="italic">An Essay for Promoting of Psalmody</span> (1710). Some of the <span class="italic">Psalms</span> and their associated hymns (including the celebrated &#145;While shepherds watch'd their flocks by night&#146;) survive in hymnals to this day. In 1713 Tate acted as co-editor of a short-lived periodical <span class="italic">The Monitor</span>, &#145;Intended for the Promoting of Religion and Virtue, and Suppressing of Vice and Immorality&#146;.<br>
<br>Tate published a substantial quantity of prose throughout his career, including translations from Heliodorus (1686) and Lucian (1711), an edition of Quintus Curtius Rufus's <span class="italic">Life of Alexander the Great</span> (1690; with a dedication comparing William III with Alexander), and <span class="italic">A Present for the Ladies: being an Historical Vindication of the Female Sex</span> (1692). He was also active, particularly in the earlier part of his career, as a dramatist and librettist. His first play <span class="italic">Brutus of Alba</span> (performed in 1677&#150;8; published in 1678), a tragedy in blank verse based on Book 4 of Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> and heavily influenced by Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>, was soon followed by a second tragedy, <span class="italic">The Loyal General</span> (published 1680). Tate's tactless decision to mount this adaptation of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Richard II</span> at the politically sensitive moment of the exclusion crisis resulted in performances being twice forbidden (December 1680; January 1681). In <span class="italic">The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth</span> (1682), an adaptation of <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, he signalled his royalist commitment in less ambiguous terms. During the mid-1680s Tate wrote the farces <span class="italic">A Duke and No Duke</span> (performed in 1684; published in 1685; based on a play by Aston Cokain), and <span class="italic">The Cuckolds-Haven</span> (1685; based on the Jonson, Chapman and Marston <span class="italic">Eastward Ho!</span>), and an adaptation from Fletcher, <span class="italic">The Island Princess</span> (1687). He later adapted Webster's <span class="italic">The White Devil</span> as <span class="italic">Injur'd Love</span> (1707). Tate's two most famous dramatic works are his adaptation of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">King Lear</span> (1681), and his libretto for Henry Purcell's <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span>. The former survived as the standard stage version of Shakespeare's play until well into the nineteenth century. The latter was performed at Josias Priest's School for Young Gentlewomen in Chelsea in 1689, but may have previously received a private performance at court (possibly about 1684).<br>
<br>Tate's later years were marred by ill health and financial difficulties, including imprisonment for debt. He died in the Mint on 30 July 1715 and was buried on 1 August in St George's Church, Southwark. Though it has been assumed that Tate never married  (Spencer, 37), a commission granted to his principal creditor Henry Whiteing for the administration of his assets after his death  (TNA: PRO, PROB 6/92, fol. 157<i>v</i>) describes him as a widower. Nothing further, however, seems to be known about his marriage.<br>
<br>Tate seems to have had an agreeable personality. According to contemporary accounts, he was learned, courteous, modest, and moral, but also, according to the antiquary William Oldys, &#145;a free, good-natured fuddling companion&#146;  (Baker, 1.443). His work, however, has had a consistently bad press. Though admired by some contemporaries, it was soon pilloried by Pope, Parnell, and Swift, and has subsequently been subjected to almost universal contempt. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> gives Tate's occupation, without further qualification, as &#145;poetaster&#146;, and his changes to the plot of <span class="italic">King Lear</span>&#151;which include the introduction of a love interest between Edgar and Cordelia, the omission of the Fool, and the contrivance of a happy ending in which Lear, Gloucester, and Cordelia all survive&#151;have been regularly regarded as risible examples of Restoration obtuseness and poor taste. However, while much of Tate's large output is now of only historical interest, some of his couplet verse attains genuine distinction; several of his religious poems still retain their currency after three centuries; and his version of <span class="italic">King Lear</span> is arguably an intelligent response to features of Shakespeare's original which distinguished critics such as Dr Johnson have found equally perplexing and problematic.<br>
