<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Buckeridge,  Anthony Malcolm</span>  (1912&#150;2004), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, was born on 20 June 1912 at 4 Marlow Villas, Birkbeck Road, Mill Hill, Middlesex, the only son of Ernest George Buckeridge, bank clerk, and his wife, Gertrude Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. His early life was overshadowed by the First World War. Buckeridge's father, who nurtured a private interest in poetry, was called up, sent out to the western front in 1917, and killed within half an hour of arriving at Arras. His widow took a job as a bank clerk. Young Anthony was educated by the Bank Clerks' Orphanage Fund, which sent him to board at Seaford College, Sussex. This, Buckeridge recalled, in typically quiet tones, was &#145;not a very rewarding experience. No music, no drama, no art and I remember always being hungry&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 29 June 2004). Perhaps it was not an entirely wasted experience: ahead of him in the school was the &#145;mildly eccentric&#146; Diarmaid Jennings, whose schoolboy scrapes stuck in his imagination  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 June 2004).<br>
<br>On leaving school Buckeridge worked in a City bank for two years but he was ambitious to act and had a spell in weekly repertory. The taste for amateur dramatics never left him; much later, in retirement, he would play walk-on parts with Glyndebourne Opera. Meanwhile the life of the jobbing actor was too precarious and, after taking a degree at University College, London, he began to teach in various home counties preparatory schools while simultaneously contributing light, humorous pieces to magazines and the radio. On 14 April 1936 he married Sylvia Goulden, daughter of John Brown, a physician, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Just before the Second World War Buckeridge joined the staff of St Lawrence College, Ramsgate; in 1939 he enrolled with the National Fire Service. His refusal to enlist was probably influenced by the revered memory of his father whose &#145;war had lasted half an hour and whose death achieved nothing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 29 June 2004).<br>
<br>After the war Buckeridge went back to St Lawrence College, where he was head of English from 1944 to 1949, and continued to flirt with the stage. His biggest success as a playwright for adults was with <span class="italic">Draw the Line Somewhere</span>, a light comedy. At school he was remembered as a mild, enthusiastic, and engaging teacher who seldom became upset. AWB, as he was known, began to tell bedtime stories in the dormitories of St Lawrence about a schoolboy character named Jennings. Subsequently he transferred the adventures of Linbury Court (his fictional school) to BBC radio play scripts. The producer of &#145;Jennings Learns the Ropes&#146; was so impressed by Buckeridge's writing that he commissioned a series for <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>. A total of sixty-two episodes were broadcast over the next sixteen years. At one time Jennings was played by Peter Asher, brother of the actress Jane Asher. Such was the popularity of these broadcasts that Buckeridge recast his material into a classic English school story, <span class="italic">Jennings Goes to School</span>, published by William Collins in 1950. Some twenty-one Jennings stories followed, with many appearing in translation. In the French edition Jennings became Bennett, in the German Fredy, and in the Norwegian Stompa. Buckeridge tried to keep up with the times and wrote four Rex Milligan books (1953&#150;61) set in a state school, but these did not succeed. His gift was for the affectionate portrayal of the nearly extinct educational ecosystem of the English boys' preparatory school, with its dotty slang (&#145;frantic bishes&#146; and &#145;fossilised fish-hooks&#146;), and for the farcical adventures of the irrepressible J. C. T. Jennings and his loyal, though dim, ally Darbishire. Every episode of these well-crafted tales was also burnished with Buckeridge's inimitable turn of phrase, so evocative of school: &#145;you prehistoric clodpoll&#146;; &#145;you gruesome specimen&#146;; &#145;you newt-brained shrimp wit&#146;.<br>
<br>As his books suggested, Anthony Buckeridge was a man of modest, rather winning, demeanour whose self-portrait was encoded in the character of Mr Carter and his &#145;shrewd knowledge of the youthful mind&#146;. At odds with his career in private education, he was a lifelong socialist who had demonstrated against Franco as a young man and later supported the Sandinistas with the donation of a signed Jennings first edition. In retirement he lived at Barcombe Mills, Lewes, Sussex, with his second wife, Eileen Norah Selby, a teacher, whom he married in 1962 following his divorce from his first wife; they had a son. Buckeridge published a memoir, <span class="italic">While I Remember</span> (1999), and in 2000 gave his blessing in a radio interview to the Harry Potter phenomenon, though he felt that J. K. Rowling's appointment as OBE was &#145;way over the top&#146;. He himself was appointed OBE in 2003, but typically did not list it in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. He once wrote: &#145;If I'd been an undertaker, I'd probably have written funny stories about funerals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Independent</span>, 8 Dec 1991). He died of heart failure on 28 June 2004, at East Crink, his home in Lewes, and was survived by his second wife and three children.<br>
