<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morison,  Stanley Arthur</span>  (1889&#150;1967), <span class="occ">typographer</span>, was born at Kent Villa, Tavistock Road, Wanstead, Essex, on 6 May 1889, the only son and second of the three children of Arthur Andrew Morison (1856&#150;1932) and his wife, Alice Louisa (1863&#150;1951), daughter of Charles Cole, clerk, of Hackney, London. His father, an unsuccessful and intemperate commercial traveller, deserted the family when Morison was fourteen, causing him to leave Owen's School, Islington, in 1903 and to find paid work. After a phase of sharing his mother's agnosticism, he was received into the Roman Catholic church in December 1908. Unhappy as a clerk with the London City Mission (1905&#150;12), he spent his spare time in museums and public libraries. The <span class="italic">Times</span> printing supplement of 10 September 1912 concentrated his mind on the study of letter-forms, printed and written, and early in the following year he was fortunate in securing a post as assistant in the office of <span class="italic">The Imprint</span>, a new monthly periodical devoted to design in printing. When <span class="italic">The Imprint</span> seemed likely to fail in the following year, the editor recommended Morison to Wilfrid Meynell, husband of Alice Meynell and managing director of Burns and Oates, Roman Catholic publishers, who took him on his staff. Morison afterwards felt deeply grateful to the Meynell family for their help and encouragement.<br>
<br>In 1916 Morison made known his conscientious objection to war service. His appeal against conscription on religious and moral grounds was dismissed, and on 7 May 1916 he was arrested. Eventually he accepted alternative employment, and by the time the war ended he was engaged in farm work. Meanwhile, on 18 March 1916 he had married Mabel Williamson (1872&#150;1961), a schoolteacher. Not until many years later did Morison learn that she was not seven but seventeen years older than himself. Morison never spoke of his marriage: late in 1926 he made a settlement on his wife and they separated. He had formed a close relationship, undoubtedly amorous but as certainly chaste, with the American historian of typography and publicist Mrs Beatrice Lamberton Warde. They remained attached until he died.<br>
<br>After the war Wilfrid and his son, Francis Meynell, found Morison temporary employment until, in June 1921, he went as typographer to the Cloister Press near Manchester. The press was liquidated in July 1922 and Morison was never again employed full-time. At various times he acted as freelance consultant to several publishers including Benn, Gollancz, Cape, and Heinemann, but his position as Britain's greatest authority on letter-design was won by his career with the Lanston Monotype Corporation, for which he acted as typographical adviser from 1922 until 1954. A dozen typefaces made to his specifications, some rendering old designs, others drawn by living artists including Eric Gill and Berthold Wolpe, became those most commonly used for printing in Great Britain and to a large extent abroad.<br>
<br>Morison's writings, over two hundred books, articles, collections of specimens, reviews, and prefaces, strongly affected the taste and enlarged the knowledge of experts and amateurs concerned with book production. A succession of learned essays in the annual <span class="italic">The Fleuron</span> (1923&#150;30), founded in conjunction with Oliver Simon, discovered much that was of value in the history of type and its relation to the work of scribes and writing masters. The final one, &#145;First principles of typography&#146;, was frequently reprinted, and was translated into six languages during Morison's lifetime. On weekly visits to Cambridge, where from 1925 he was part-time typographical adviser to the university press, he was the perfect collaborator for its printer, Walter Lewis, until 1945 and for his successor, Brooke Crutchley, until 1959.<br>
<br>Morison's great service to <span class="italic">The Times</span> over thirty years made him known to a wider public, though in this, and in most of his work for other organizations, he believed that the authority of joint responsibility depended on anonymity. His appointment as typographical adviser was the result of his caustic comments on the paper's drab and old-fashioned look made in 1929. His views, reported to the manager, led eventually to his being asked to submit proposals. Through 1930 and 1931 he advocated typographical changes, including the abandonment of the ornamental gothic for the title. As a consequence a new typeface was cut, and when <span class="italic">The Times</span> first appeared in Times New Roman on 3 October 1932 almost all correspondents found it a relief to their eyes. Morison's position at <span class="italic">The Times</span> developed into something much more than adviser on printing. He edited and largely wrote the four-volume <span class="italic">History of &#145;The Times&#146;</span> (1935&#150;52) and was for two years, 1945&#150;7, editor of the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. He was consulted about organization and appointments of personnel, and even for a time about editorial policy. He retired from <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1960.<br>
<br>Morison's researches in newspaper history, first presented at length in his Sandars lectures, published as <span class="italic">The English Newspaper</span>, at Cambridge in 1932, led to a fascination with the power of the press. He relished the friendship of Lord Beaverbrook, who entertained him in the years 1948&#150;63 to holidays in the Bahamas and on the Riviera.<br>
<br>Morison's involvement with the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> began in 1949, when he met the publisher William Benton; in 1961 he was added to the editorial board. In this connection he made periodic visits to Chicago (the city that came nearest to rivalling London in his affections: he disliked country living) and enjoyed Mediterranean cruises in Senator Benton's yacht.<br>
<br>Morison far excelled other typographers of his day in point of erudition; and his choice of type-designs, prompted by a fastidious mind and a sensitive eye, was enduring. His capacity for gaining the confidence of managements and commanding the skill of technicians made him a leader in his profession. Consequently, his influence on book printing was powerful, and he exerted it in favour of an austere and traditional style, with an improved repertory of type. As a scholar he was quick to grasp essentials but could be inaccurate in details. In his ambitiously conceived Lyell lectures at Oxford in 1957 (published in 1972 as <span class="italic">Politics and script: aspects of authority and freedom in the development of Graeco-Latin script</span>, edited by Nicolas Barker) he drew especially on almost thirty years' advice and friendship of the palaeographer E. A. Lowe. His work on the history of the Fell types at Oxford University Press, a project with a similarly long history, relied in its last stages principally on Harry Carter. These two works preoccupied him in the last years of his life, and offer a summation of his scholarly interests.<br>
<br>Cambridge University honoured Morison with the degree of LittD in 1950, and he held honorary doctorates also from Birmingham and Marquette (Wisconsin). He was elected FBA in 1954 and appointed royal designer for industry in 1960; but he declined three offers of knighthood, one shortly after playing a pivotal part in the acquisition by the British Museum of the <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span> in 1934.<br>
<br>Morison was of spare build; wore spectacles (steel-rimmed) from his youth up, the lenses thickening as he aged. Dressed invariably in a black suit with a white shirt and black tie, outdoors with a rather small black hat, he struck strangers as looking like a Jesuit. He was vigorous and did not spare himself; in middle life he travelled a great deal in search of information. His talk was pugnacious in a humorous way. Victorian in morals, on other subjects he would differ without bitterness, although he had no doubts about his own opinions. In politics he was radical; he spoke contemptuously of the Roman curia, resented monarchy, and thought capitalism was wrong but invincible. Communist friends dissuaded him in 1921 from applying for membership of their party. Apart from the breviary, which he always carried, he read only for information, increasingly about liturgy and ecclesiology; in music he eventually cared only for plainchant. His fine collection of books was presented by Sir Allen Lane to Cambridge University Library, where it is kept in the Morison Room.<br>
<br>Given handsome parting presents from <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the Monotype Corporation, and a generous subsidy from Senator Benton, Morison lived his declining years in comfort in a double suite of rooms at 2 Whitehall Court, Westminster, and indulged a discriminating taste in food and wines. He visited Chicago in 1966, but by May 1967 he had taken to a wheelchair because of spinal weakness, and he could hardly see. He died of heart failure at home, on 11 October 1967. Following a requiem mass in Westminster Cathedral he was buried at Paddington new cemetery, Mill Hill, on 18 October.<br>
