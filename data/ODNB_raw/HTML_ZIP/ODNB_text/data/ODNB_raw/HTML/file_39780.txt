<span class="headword">Graham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Horsley-Beresford]</span>,  Caroline Agnes</span>, duchess of Montrose  (1818&#150;1894), <span class="occ">racehorse owner</span>, was born at Bolam, Northumberland, on 23 January 1818, the third and youngest daughter of John Horsley-Beresford, second Baron Decies (1774&#150;1855), and his wife, Charlotte Philadelphia (<i>d</i>. 1852), only daughter and heir of Robert Horsley of Bolam House, Morpeth. On 15 October 1836 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11202/', "James Graham, fourth duke of Montrose (1799&#150;1874)")</script> and Conservative politician, at St George's Church, Hanover Square, London, and entered on a career as a prominent society hostess. They had three sons and three daughters; the youngest son, Douglas Beresford Malise Ronald Graham (1852&#150;1925), succeeded to the dukedom.<br>
<br>It was while married to Montrose that Caroline began her long association with the turf. Although she was thoroughly knowledgeable on all aspects of thoroughbred racing and breeding, she was obliged to race under the pseudonym of Mr Manton, as racing was not then considered a suitable pastime for a lady. (The actress Lillie Langtry raced under the name Mr Jersey.) Her interest was, however, no secret: her association with the Manton trainer Alec Taylor was well known.<br>
<br>Caroline was widowed in 1874, but in 1876 she married the celebrated owner, Jockey Club member, and dandy William Stuart Stirling Crawfurd (1819&#150;1883). It was largely as a result of this second marriage that her turf career really developed. Together with Craw, as her husband was known, the duchess (who still preferred to be addressed by her title) patronized not only Taylor at Manton but also Joe Dawson's Bedford Lodge stables at Newmarket, which they later bought and turned into a private stable under the supervision of Buck Sherard.<br>
<br>The couple's scarlet racing colours which, with the duchess's bright red hair&#151;usually crowned with a large Homburg hat&#151;earned her the nickname Carrie Red, were highly successful, winning a number of England's classic races. Their most famous racehorse was the 1878 Epsom Derby winner, Sefton, after whom the duchess named the purpose-built stables to which she moved her interests in the winter of 1882&#150;3. Their other classic winners included Craig Millar (winner of the St Leger) and Moslem (joint winner in a dead heat for the 1868 Two Thousand Guineas). In addition Craw's filly Thebais won both the One Thousand Guineas and the Oaks in 1881 and the couple together enjoyed further One Thousand Guineas success with St Marguerite and Mayonnaise.<br>
<br>The duchess was shattered by Craw's death at Cannes in 1883. She had his body brought back to England and buried at St Agnes's Church, Newmarket, which she had built and endowed in his memory. All Craw's horses were kept in training, many of them ridden by the most brilliant jockey of the times, Fred Archer. Archer's ease with his social superiors was often remarked upon and he certainly enjoyed a close relationship with the duchess. It was rumoured that the two were planning to marry, until Archer found out that marriage to a duchess was not enough to make him a duke and cried off.<br>
<br>But Caroline did marry again. Her third husband, Marcus Henry Milner (1864&#150;1939), son of Henry Beilby William Milner, banker, whom she married on 26 July 1888 at the age of seventy, was forty-six years her junior and the couple were widely believed to be unhappy. The duchess, however, who continued to live at Sefton Lodge, was unlikely to be troubled by gossip. A number of her contemporaries, most notably the Hon. George Lambton, testified to her strength of personality and grand disregard for the opinions of others. She was said to have threatened the vicar of St Agnes's with dismissal for uttering a prayer for a fine, dry harvest time shortly before one of his patroness's horses, with a known fondness for heavy going, was due to race in a big handicap.<br>
<br>Caroline died on 16 November 1894 at her home at 45 Belgrave Square, London; she was buried four days later, near to her beloved Craw at St Agnes's. The dispersal sale of her stud on 11 December 1894 had far-reaching results for the British turf: the mare Canterbury Pilgrim, sold to the earl of Derby, went on to establish one of the most influential strains in British racing.<br>
