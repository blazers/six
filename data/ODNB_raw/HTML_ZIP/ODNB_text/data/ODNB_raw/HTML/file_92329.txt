<span class="headword">Godolphin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Churchill]</span>,  Henrietta <span class="st"> [Harriet]</span></span>, <i>suo jure</i> duchess of Marlborough  (1681&#150;1733), <span class="occ">patron of the arts</span>, was born on 19 July 1681, the second child (and first to survive infancy) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5401/', "John Churchill, later first duke of Marlborough (1650&#150;1722)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5405/', "Sarah Churchill, n&#233;e Jenyns (1660&#150;1744)")</script>. Called Harriet within her family, she was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 29 July 1681, and was educated privately at home under her mother's direction. On 28 April 1698 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10877/', "Francis Godolphin (1678&#150;1766)")</script>, only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10882/', "Sidney Godolphin, afterwards first earl of Godolphin (1645&#150;1712)")</script>. Princess Anne, a close friend of the couple's parents, contributed &pound;5000 to Lady Henrietta's dowry. Lady Henrietta and her husband had four children: William (nicknamed Willigo), born prematurely on 6 February 1699, Henrietta (known as Harriet), born on 12 April 1701, and Margaret and Henry, who both died in infancy.<br>
<br>Lady Henrietta and her husband at first lived in her mother's apartments at St James's Palace, which her mother held as lady of the bedchamber to the princess. Lady Henrietta and her mother were close until the young Godolphins moved to Lord Godolphin's house, on the south-west corner of the palace, in 1701. Lady Henrietta was allowed more independence by her father-in-law, and soon came to resent her mother's attempts to maintain restrictions on whom she saw. Queen Anne&#151;to whom Lady Henrietta was a lady of the bedchamber from 1702 to 1712 (at a salary of &pound;1000 p.a.) and who was godmother to her son Henry in 1704&#151;also encouraged the expansion of her social life.<br>
<br>Lady Henrietta's circle came to include not only young aristocrats but also writers, whom she was patronizing by 1704 when her mother wrote of her as &#145;having a great mind to be thought a Wit&#146; by associating with &#145;Mr Congreve and several Poets, and in short the worst company that a Young Lady can keep&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 61451, fol. 20). She probably first met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6069/', "William Congreve (1670&#150;1729)")</script> in 1703. It is not known when they became lovers but he may have been the fellow sinner when in 1711 it was said that Henrietta had &#145;latly been in Pickell for her sins&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 214). Lady Henrietta's relationship with Congreve was tolerated by her complaisant husband, but contributed towards her estrangement from her mother. Yet while both her parents lived, Lady Henrietta&#151;who became countess of Godolphin when her husband succeeded to the earldom in 1712&#151;was substantially dependent on their influence. In 1715 she sent her daughter Lady Harriet Godolphin to live at Marlborough House so that Sarah could arrange her marriage; Lady Harriet was married to the rising whig politician Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, in 1717.<br>
<br>On her father's death in 1722 the countess of Godolphin succeeded as duchess of Marlborough in her own right, an act of parliament in 1706 having allowed Marlborough's daughters to inherit his titles. She was reported to have an annual income of &pound;40,000, but in fact her income was severely curtailed by her father's will, which appointed seven trustees to invest his wealth in the interest of specific beneficiaries, chief among whom was the dowager duchess, Sarah, who enjoyed &pound;20,000 p.a. and the ducal residence of Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, for her lifetime. None the less, the new duchess was able to support the arts more lavishly. She sponsored concerts by Handel's rival Giovanni Bononcini, and settled &pound;500 p.a. upon him in 1724. She received dedications from John Gay, David Mallet, and lesser poets. She and other titled ladies competed to fund Gay and were satirized for this in <span class="italic">The Female Faction</span> (1729).<br>
<br>The duchess's inheritance may have given her more freedom to pursue her affair with Congreve. On 23 November 1723, aged forty-two, twenty years after the birth of her last child, she gave birth to a daughter, Mary. The child was acknowledged by the earl of Godolphin and lovingly brought up by him, but she was almost certainly Congreve's daughter. The dowager duchess called her granddaughter Moll Congreve and regarded her as another blow to the family prestige and prospects inflicted by Henrietta. The birth also offended Henrietta's son William, marquess of Blandford, and encouraged him to further prolong his residence on the continent, where he had lived since 1719.<br>
<br>Congreve died on 19 January 1729, leaving most of his estate of over &pound;10,000 to Henrietta on the unwritten understanding that she would bequeath it intact to their daughter, Mary. Henrietta sat by his corpse until it was interred in Westminster Abbey, gave him a handsome funeral, and erected a monument over his grave with an epitaph composed by herself. A report in the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> on 15 July 1732 of damage to a waxwork figure of Congreve, made for Henrietta at a cost of &pound;200 and kept in her house, prompted a coarse verse satire <span class="italic">Phino-Godol</span> (1732), reissued as <span class="italic">The Amorous D--h--ss</span> (1733). The waxwork story, variously and improbably embellished, has been frequently retold. Henrietta's liaison with Congreve was also the subject of &#145;The Secret History of Henrada Maria Teresa&#146; in a miscellany, <span class="italic">The Court Parrot</span> (November 1733).<br>
<br>Any aspirations the duchess of Marlborough had to become a dynastic matriarch were frustrated by her mother's uncertain but enduring good health. The death of her son William while attending a tory drinking club at Oxford in 1731 could be seen as another limitation, ensuring that the Marlborough title (limited to the first duke's daughters and the heirs male of their bodies, thus precluding the claims of Henrietta's daughters) would not be held by Henrietta's descendants in the foreseeable future. However, her indifference to her son's career during his life, and her backward-looking statement on his death that &#145;the Duke of Marlborough was now not in danger of being represented in the next generation by one who must have brought any name he bore into contempt&#146;  (Harris, 283), suggest that she had long given up on any hopes of rivalling her mother.<br>
<br>Henrietta died of dropsy in the limbs on 24 October 1733 at Harrow, Middlesex. She refused to see her mother to the last. She was buried on 9 November, as she directed, in Westminster Abbey in the grave of her father-in-law, Sidney, first earl of Godolphin, very close to Congreve's grave, on 9 November. She instructed that her body should never be taken to Blenheim, where she had never lived. The Marlborough titles passed to her nephew Charles Spencer, fifth earl of Sunderland. Under her will, dated 11 July 1732, and proved on 19 May 1736, her daughter Mary received intact the Congreve inheritance (&pound;7000 of which had been invested in a diamond necklace and earrings) together with most of Henrietta's estate. Maria Catherina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Jonge, marchioness of Blandford, widow of Henrietta's son William, was specifically excluded from any benefit; her origins as the daughter of a Dutch burgomaster had been a scandal in themselves. Lord Godolphin was executor of both Congreve's and Henrietta's wills.<br>
<br>Lady Mary Godolphin, apparently unaware of her true paternity, was cherished by the earl of Godolphin and her half-sister Harriet and was accepted by her grandmother Sarah. She married Thomas Osborne, fourth duke of Leeds, on 26 June 1740 and died on 3 August 1764. Lord Godolphin, a man of exemplary patience and domestic affection, died on 17 January 1766.<br>
<br>It has been argued that Henrietta was satirized as the unnamed peeress who &#145;sins with Poets thro' pure Love of Wit&#146; in Pope's <span class="italic">Epistle to a Lady</span> (1744 edition), lines 69&#150;76. Her career was that of a daughter of domineering parents and a frustrated heiress; her cultural interests and her affair with Congreve were the only positive means available of emphasizing her independence from her politically conscious mother, who prevented her from assuming the role of guardian of the Marlborough legacy which she might have been expected to inherit with the dukedom.<br>
