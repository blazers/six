<span class="headword">Wilton,  Robb</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Robert Smith]</span>  (1881&#150;1957), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 28 August 1881 at 34 Tillotson Street, Everton, Liverpool, the son of Joseph Smith, compositor, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Poland, actress. He was soundly educated locally and was prepared for the engineering trade, but in 1899 he made his stage d&eacute;but at the Theatre Royal, Garston, Liverpool, which was known colloquially as the Old Blood Tub from its penchant for melodrama. He played the villain for over three years yet, prophetically, during scene-changes he would occupy the audience with his amusing Pie-face characterization. While playing the villain in <span class="italic">The Greed of Gold</span> at the Alexandra Theatre, Hull, in 1903, he met and courted the play's heroine, the actress Florence Palmer (<i>d</i>. 1956); defying theatrical convention the villain married the heroine at Holy Trinity Church, Stalybridge, on 21 January 1904. This was to be a devotedly close partnership both professionally and personally: Florence acted as her husband's associate in sketches, and they sedulously avoided work that required them to be apart. Their only child, Robert, was born in 1907 and died in 1943 having fallen from a window during the wartime blackout.<br>
<br>Wilton turned more specifically to comedy in late 1903 at the Liverpool Lyric and Pavilion theatres, and was spotted by the impresario Sir Walter De Frece, who offered him a three-year contract. He thus embarked on a solid career, making his London d&eacute;but at the Holborn Empire in 1909, and touring to Australia, Canada, and the USA, chiefly performing his sketches as fireman, policeman, prison governor, and First World War soldier. After some twenty years as a single and double act on the halls, his stage success as the Confidential Comedian brought him a royal command performance in 1926: his sketch &#145;The Magistrate&#146; served as a precursor of his later courtroom antics. He quickly adapted to the new medium of radio, making his first broadcast in 1922 from Savoy Hill, and he also appeared in films, several of which, including <span class="italic">The Fire Brigade</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Stars on Parade</span> (1935), happily preserve his stage sketches.<br>
<br>On stage Robb Wilton presented a burly but very still figure&#151;save for the rounded, pallid countenance which was a veritable circus for the emotions, with eyes and tongue ceaselessly active and with, famously, the right-hand fingers beating out a series of puzzled tics across ear, brow, cheek, and lips. The Lancastrian voice was gruff, measured, and halting in bewilderment. His catch-phrase was the widely recognizable lugubrious opening line &#145;The day war broke out &hellip;&#146;. Wilton described himself as a &#145;comedy character actor&#146; and he depended on his well-observed portrayal of minor officialdom in self-made scripts for his standard cameos which, as he remarked, would have been worthless to any other comic. His great strength lay in his timing, in what <span class="italic">The Times</span> (17 February 1956) termed &#145;a tug of war between performer and audience&#146;. He vied with Jimmy James as the shrewdest &#145;waiter&#146; in the business. For example, when he told how his wife, Rita, insisted he must find work, the pause until his almost sighed rejoinder&#151;&#145;ee, she's a cruel tongue, that woman&#146;&#151;was inordinately lengthy and beautifully judged. His forte lay in the gentle probing of petty bureaucratic officiousness. It evoked the fine tradition of Shakespeare's inefficient constable, Dogberry, in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, and a whole stream of Dickensian inventions, such as Mr Bumble in <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>.<br>
<br>Robb Wilton created several prototypes of officials who balanced lethargic dignity with fussy inaction, four of which were especially noteworthy. The first was the policeman, confronted at his station desk by a Florence Palmer eager to confess to the poisoning of her husband, and the second the fireman, again beset by a distraught Florence, her house ablaze: &#145;It's a prettier run&#146;, he explained to her anxious householder concerned at the extensive itinerary he planned for the fire engine. Then there was his &#145;Court of not so common pleas&#146; over which he presided as Mr Muddlecombe JP, dispensing confused justice and as unmoved by critical urgencies as by the dictates of rational sense. This caricature ensured his top stage billing as surely as it made him a household radio name from 1937 onwards. His fourth abiding creation was the home guardsman, peevish and resentful of &#145;Rita's&#146; cold scepticism (advised that he wouldn't know who Hitler was, come an invasion, he commented with suitably plaintive timing: &#145;doesn't she know I've got a tongue in me head?&#146;) and immune to her scorn when the headquarters proved to be a little hut behind the Dog and Pullet pub.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, with its emphasis on civilian involvement, Wilton found his exact niche. Confounded by frustrating controls and regulations, the embattled citizenry found enormous solace in his skits on Bumbledom. He represented the British myth of &#145;muddling through&#146;, the comic muse's reflection of the mood of the nation.<br>
<br>Florence Palmer died in February 1956, and her husband did not long survive her. Robb Wilton made his last radio broadcast for <span class="italic">Blackpool Night</span> in August 1956 and, following a bladder operation, died in Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool on 1 May 1957.<br>
