<span class="headword">Rooke, Sir  Denis Eric</span>  (1924&#150;2008), <span class="occ">engineer and industrialist</span>, was born on 2 April 1924 at 42 Erlanger Road, New Cross, London, the younger son of Frederick George Rooke, printer and commercial traveller, and his wife, Ada Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown. As a very young child he spent four years in and out of Great Ormond Street Hospital, and did not learn to read and write until he was seven. He was educated at Westminster City School and Addey and Stanhope School, New Cross, and in 1944 graduated from University College, London (evacuated to Swansea during the war), with a first-class degree in mechanical engineering. Commissioned into the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 1944, he served in Britain and India, rising to the rank of major. After demobilization in 1948, he studied for a postgraduate diploma in chemical engineering at University College, London, which was awarded in 1949. On 22 January 1949 he married (Elizabeth) Brenda Evans (<i>b</i>. 1922), an investigator providing research services, and daughter of David Daniel Evans, chief clerk of the Miners' Federation, of Ystradgynlais, Brecon; they had one daughter, Diana.<br>
<br>After a temporary job with the South Metropolitan Gas Company, Rooke was appointed assistant mechanical engineer for the South Eastern Gas Board in 1949, the year of the nationalization of the gas industry, working at the coal tar by-products works in Greenwich; he was appointed deputy manager of the tar works in 1954. The gas industry had been searching for natural gas (methane) since 1952, and in 1957 Rooke was seconded to the North Thames Gas Board to explore the possibility of securing a supply of liquefied natural gas to replace &#145;town gas&#146;, manufactured from coal, which was dirty and smelly. He was invited in 1959 to join the team of technicians sailing on the first voyage of the experimental tanker <span class="italic">Methane Pioneer</span>, bringing liquefied natural gas across the Atlantic from Louisiana to Britain. The Gas Council set up a development and planning section to be responsible for planning new production and processes and to develop a new integrated supply system, and in 1960 Rooke was appointed development engineer to head the new organization. Following the successful trials of this method of transporting methane, the first natural gas terminal in Britain was built on Canvey Island, and natural gas began to be shipped from the United States and Algeria, and distributed through pipelines to the area gas boards.<br>
<br>In 1964 methane was discovered under the North Sea, the first licences were issued to oil companies to prospect for North Sea gas, and the Gas Council committed itself to the supply of North Sea gas. Rooke joined the board of the Gas Council in 1966 as member for production and supplies, responsible for exploration and controlling the delivery of gas from the gas fields to the consumer via the area boards. This entailed the design and construction of new onshore terminals on the east coast to receive the gas, and expansion of the gas grid throughout the mainland. The first supplies of gas began coming ashore at Easington in 1967. Over the next ten years Rooke played a leading role in the conversion of every gas appliance in Britain, in 12 million households, as natural gas did not burn satisfactorily in appliances designed to burn manufactured gas, and also oversaw the construction of a national pipeline system. When in 1977 he announced the completion of the appliance conversion programme, he described it as &#145;perhaps the biggest peacetime operation in the nation's history&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Sept 1977). Meanwhile, appointed deputy chairman of the Gas Council in 1972, he was responsible for the reorganization of the distribution network, replacing the twelve area boards with a new regional structure for the British Gas Corporation (BGC), created in 1973.<br>
<br>Rooke was appointed chairman of the BGC in 1976. In 1979 a Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher was elected, committed to reforming the nationalized industries (though not yet to their wholesale privatization). One of its first targets was the gas industry, and a few months after the election the government proposed the sale of the oil interests of the BGC. The latter had been building up its interests in North Sea gas exploration, and had developed onshore oilfields, the most important of which was at Wytch Farm, in Dorset, a collaboration with British Petroleum. Rooke, opposed to the break-up of the gas industry, as were many members of his board, also resisted the plan to part with its oilfield interests, continuing to battle with Nigel Lawson, the new secretary of state for energy, despite a government direction in October 1981 to dispose of Wytch Farm for the best price, and doing his best to frustrate the sale: &#145;The detailed information &hellip; had to be supplied by British Gas, and extracting this proved very much more difficult than extracting the gas itself&#146;  (Lawson, 214). This sale was concluded in 1984, by which time the government had sold all the other oilfield assets of the BGC.<br>
<br>Government intervention in fuel-price setting had already attracted Rooke's ire. In 1979 David Howell, the energy secretary, increased the price of domestic gas by ten percentage points more than the rate of inflation for the following three years. These large annual increases were attacked by Rooke in a leaflet which was enclosed with every household bill, blaming the government for the price rise. In 1981 Nigel Lawson took steps to weaken what he called &#145;Rooke's empire&#146;, including the abolition of the BGC's monopoly in the purchase of gas and its resale to industry, which had given it full control of the exploitation of North Sea gas fields and the volumes available to British industry. Lawson regarded Rooke's view that gas was too high quality a fuel to burn in power stations as a &#145;mystical doctrine&#146;, and accused the BGC of refusing to supply to customers of whom Rooke disapproved. The <span class="roman">Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act</span> of 1983 enabled oil companies that produced gas as a by-product to supply large customers using the BGC pipeline network. However, Rooke's opposition prevented the sale of the 900 BGC gas showrooms, proposed in 1981.<br>
<br>After the 1983 general election, when the Conservatives were returned to power with the promise to accelerate privatization, the government turned to privatization of the BGC. Lawson, now chancellor of the exchequer, wanted to break the corporation up into separate regional companies. Rooke could see no case for structural change, and progress was slow. Peter Walker, the new energy secretary, was more sympathetic to Rooke's view that the company should be kept intact. Realizing what a formidable opponent she faced, and anxious to complete the privatization of gas during the life of the parliament, the prime minister agreed to the privatization of the British Gas Corporation as a whole. The <span class="roman">Gas Act</span> was passed in July 1986, and British Gas was floated in December 1986 as a regulated monopoly. After the successful &#145;Tell Sid&#146; campaign to attract small investors, the offer was more than twice oversubscribed, with 4.5 million buying shares in the new company, netting the government &pound;7.7 billion. Rooke remained chairman until his retirement in 1989. Successive subsequent regulatory measures resulted in 1997 in the break-up of British Gas plc into two new companies, Centrica/British Gas and Transco (later National Grid UK), and the opening of the market to competition.<br>
<br>Rooke, described by Peter Walker as &#145;the best nationalised industry chairman I met&#146;  (Walker, 192), spent his whole career in the gas industry, and played a large part in the switch from manufactured gas to cheap natural gas from the North Sea and the development of a national gas distribution network. Throughout his struggle against privatization he was driven by the conviction that a nationalized gas industry best served the needs of the consumers. He was knighted in 1977, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1997. Elected to the Fellowship of Engineering (later the Royal Academy of Engineering) in 1977, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1978 and was awarded the society's Rumford medal in 1986. Described by Nigel Lawson as &#145;a large, craggy overbearing man&#146;  (Lawson, 213), he had a direct and sometimes abrasive manner, and a powerful intellect. He had a strong commitment to engineering education, serving on many boards and advisory committees: he was chairman of the Council for National Academic Awards from 1978 to 1983. As chairman of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, from 1987 to 1991, he overhauled the commission's award structure with the aim of focusing the awards on the needs of British industry. After his retirement from British Gas he devoted a lot of time and energy to raising the status of the engineering profession, helping to establish both the Fellowship of Engineering and the Worshipful Company of Engineers, which he served as president. He was chancellor of Loughborough University from 1989 to 2003, where a bronze bust (2004) by David Williams-Ellis was unveiled outside the new building named after him. He served as president of the Royal Academy of Engineering from 1986 to 1991 and was awarded its Prince Philip Medal in 1992. Two medals were named after him: the Rooke medal for the public promotion of engineering, awarded by the Royal Academy of Engineering, and the Sir Denis Rooke medal, a lifetime achievement award given by the Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers. Rooke loved listening to music and opera, and was a keen wildflower photographer. He died of cancer on 2 September 2008 in Greenwich and Bexley Cottage Hospice, 185 Bostall Hill, Abbey Wood, London, and was survived by his wife and daughter. A memorial service was held in Southwark Cathedral on 26 November 2008.<br>
