<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White,  Joseph Blanco</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Blanco y Crespo]</span>  (1775&#150;1841), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 11 July 1775 in the calle Jamerdana, Seville, the eldest of the four children of Guillermo Blanco y Morrogh (1745&#150;1815), a merchant, and his wife, Mar&iacute;a Gertrudis Crespo y Neve (<i>d</i>. 1819). He had two sisters and a brother.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlylife"></a>Background and early life</h2>His paternal grandfather, William White, emigrated from Waterford to Andalusia at the beginning of the eighteenth century and established an import&#150;export business in Seville. His father, also William White, adopted the Spanish form of his name, Guillermo Blanco, and married into the lesser nobility: Mar&iacute;a's uncle, Felipe de la Neve, was governor of California and founder (in 1781) of Los Angeles. The family firm went bankrupt in 1769 and though reconstituted was much reduced in scale.<br>
<br>Blanco grew up isolated from other children, &#145;with deeply inculcated ideas of gentility&#146;. He inherited his mother's ardent and mercurial temperament and &#145;a sensibility beyond description&#146;. His father, a reserved and selfless man dedicated to works of practical charity, set his son to work in the office alongside the Irish clerks, but allowed him private lessons in Latin and music. The music master lent him <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>, which he &#145;devoured&#146; in secret, and later in his aunt's library he discovered the works of the enlightened Benedictine Benito Feijoo, which he regarded as having first awakened his critical faculties. Youthful piety, the desire to please his mother, and an eagerness to exchange the drudgery of the counting-house for the pleasures of literary study prompted him to declare his vocation for the priesthood; after some opposition by his Irish relatives he was sent in 1789 to the Dominican college of Santo Tom&aacute;s. Henceforth he was to be a Spanish clerical gentleman.<br>
<br>In 1790 Blanco entered the University of Seville, but he learned less from the scholastic course there than from two older students, Manuel Mar&iacute;a del M&aacute;rmol and Manuel Mar&iacute;a de Arjona, who supervised his philosophical and literary formation. In 1794 he joined a private literary academy founded by his close friends Alberto Lista and Felix-Jos&eacute; Reinoso for self-education and mutual encouragement in poetry and rhetoric. Under the patronage of the enlightened lawyer J. P. Forner they cultivated an idealistic Christian humanism which was at odds with the anti-intellectual tone of clerical society. The Spanish Jansenist movement, to which they were drawn and which advocated the reform and purification of the church, put down few roots in Seville.<br>
<br>Although a visit to the more worldly milieu of Cadiz and the first symptoms of &#145;an amorous temperament&#146; prompted thoughts of escape, Blanco proceeded to ordination as subdeacon in 1796 and priest in 1798. In 1801 he won in open competition the prestigious post of <i>capell&aacute;n magistral</i> in the Royal Chapel of St Ferdinand. In the following year he underwent a profound crisis of faith brought on not only by intellectual doubts and tensions but also by emotional revulsion from a hierocracy that he now regarded as the enemy of self-fulfilment and social progress. One of his sisters died in her convent that year, and the other, under the influence of her confessor, now entered a penitential order, &#145;misled from the path of practical usefulness into a wilderness of visionary perfection&#146;  (quoted in Murphy, 26). His inner conflict is evident in a sermon preached in the Royal Chapel in 1802, in which the conventional warnings against intellectual pride were less convincing than the objections which, as devil's advocate, he voiced against a spirituality of self-annihilation.<br>
<br>After three more years in Seville, outwardly conforming to the church while inwardly rejecting it, Blanco obtained leave in 1805 to reside at Madrid. There he abandoned the practice of the priesthood and sought escape in anonymity, in &#145;the growing persuasion that the world was not under the direction of an intelligent moral agent&#146;  (&#145;Examination of Blanco by White&#146;, 35). During this period he formed a liaison with Magdalena Ezquaya, who, after his departure from Madrid, bore him a son. On obtaining the sinecure of catechist to the recently established Pestalozzian school, he came under the patronage of its protector Manuel Godoy, the &#145;Prince of the Peace&#146;, whom he eulogized in a celebratory ode (1808). After witnessing the riots that led to Godoy's fall, the entry into the city of Murat's troops, and the rising of 2 May 1808, he escaped to Seville in June to join the patriotic resistance. He was there appointed co-editor of the <span class="italic">Semanario Patri&oacute;tico</span>, the semi-official organ of the newly constituted central junta. He took an independent and radical line, urging that resistance to the French should be accompanied by internal reform, and when the junta pressed him to moderate his criticisms he resigned. As the French advanced on Seville in January 1810 he joined the loyal exodus to Cadiz, but there seized the opportunity to extricate himself from his personal impasse by taking ship for England.<h2>
<a name="England18101832"></a>England, 1810&#150;1832</h2>In London, White enjoyed the patronage of Lord Holland, whom he had already met in Seville, and the friendship of the family of Sir John Moore, whose military reputation he had defended  (see Thom, 177&#150;8). Within four months he set up a Spanish-language political journal, <span class="italic">El Espa&ntilde;ol</span>, which the Foreign Office encouraged at a discreet distance. In the first number of May 1810 he shocked his friends in Cadiz by attacking the now defunct central junta and calling for revolutionary reform. Under the influence of Lord Holland he subsequently moderated his tone, but his endorsement of the revolution in Caracas later that year, and of the right of the Spanish-American dominions to limited self-rule, provoked the regency government at Cadiz to proscribe his journal and to condemn him as a traitor. He continued to edit and write <span class="italic">El Espa&ntilde;ol</span> single-handed for four years, arguing for the transformation of the Spanish empire into a free commonwealth of self-governing, though not fully independent, nations united by allegiance to the crown. His proposals for constitutional reform included the establishment of a bicameral Cortes on the British parliamentary model. When the constitution of Cadiz was published in 1812, his sarcastic strictures on its doctrinaire utopianism further alienated him from his former colleagues. After the return of Ferdinand VII to Madrid in May 1814 he concluded the journal in a mood of despair at the polarization of Spain between the forces of reaction and revolution. Eloquent, acute, and prophetic, <span class="italic">El Espa&ntilde;ol</span> exercised a seminal influence in Spanish America. Its articles were reprinted in Mexico, Lima, Caracas, and Buenos Aires, thereby contributing to the development of a common purpose, and it moved Bol&iacute;var's political thought in a Burkean direction.<br>
<br>In 1812 the Foreign Office had granted White an annual pension of &pound;250, paid (to his chagrin) out of the secret service fund, as a remuneration for his reports on South American affairs. In 1814 the African Association commissioned him to write a pamphlet in Spanish on the slave trade, containing new evidence on the traffic organized from Havana, and this was distributed in Spain in an attempt to move its government towards abolition. His pension helped him to support his natural son Ferdinand, whom he had brought to London in 1813, though it was some time before he publicly acknowledged his paternity. Under the influence of evangelical friends, notably the auctioneer James Christie the younger, he joined the Anglican communion in 1812. Two years later his orders were revalidated by the bishop of London and he took lodgings at Oxford in order to prepare himself for his new role as a clergyman by the study of Anglican theology and Greek. In 1815 he returned to Holland House as tutor to Henry Fox, but the strain of reconciling his evangelical piety with the sceptical ethos which prevailed there, and the agitation induced by Lady Holland's caprices, prompted his resignation in 1817. His theological studies over the next four years brought him to the verge of a breakdown as he struggled with his renascent heterodoxy. He found the unitarian case unanswerable, but could not face the social ostracism which a break with orthodoxy would entail. Seeking escape from his theological impasse in renewed literary activity, in 1821 he accepted Thomas Campbell's invitation to write a series of &#145;Letters from Spain&#146; for the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, adopting the punning pseudonym Don Leucadio Doblado (&#145;double white&#146;). With their delicacy of style and colourful subject matter, the works, published in book form in 1822, caught the tide of literary taste and made White's reputation as an English man of letters. He himself attached most importance to the third letter, &#145;A few facts connected with the formation of the intellectual and moral character of a Spanish clergyman&#146;, a bitter denunciation of Catholic priestcraft, which lent itself to exploitation by the opponents of emancipation. The same anti-clerical vehemence is evident in the historical novel <span class="italic">Vargas: a Tale of Spain</span>, showing the influence of Scott, which he published, and then suppressed, in 1822.<br>
<br>In 1823 White returned to the Spanish literary arena as editor of <span class="italic">Variedades</span>, a magazine published in London by Rudolph Ackermann for the Spanish-American market. Besides earning him an annual salary of &pound;300, which helped to pay for his son's education, the work satisfied his sense of mission. Believing that political stability was contingent on the development of enlightened public opinion, he set out to improve the taste and educate the mind of a new Spain which would avoid the errors of the old. Along with translations of Scott and Shakespeare, and sketches of English life, he included extracts from old Spanish chronicles and articles of literary criticism in which he argued that the true golden age of Spanish literature preceded the imposition of a monolithic theocracy by the Catholic kings. It was his most successful attempt to free himself from the strait-jacket of rationalism and to develop a romantic aesthetic based on figurative, rather than literal, truth. The roles of English clergyman and Spanish journalist finally proved to be incompatible and he resigned the editorship in 1825 after a valedictory warning to the Spanish Americans on the dangers of religious intolerance. In the same year he made his d&eacute;but as an English poet, his sonnet &#145;Night and Death&#146; being hailed by Coleridge, the dedicatee, as &#145;the finest and most grandly conceived&#146; in the language  (Thom, 1.439).<br>
<br>In 1825 White was persuaded by Southey that it was his &#145;duty&#146; to warn the British public of the dangers of granting toleration to Roman Catholics, and to this end he wrote <span class="italic">Practical and Internal Evidence Against Catholicism</span> (1825), a portrait of the writer as victim, in which he exposed his own life as a cautionary lesson. At the suggestion of J. D. Coleridge he also wrote a simplified version, <span class="italic">The Poor Man's Preservative Against Popery</span> (1825), in the form of &#145;conversations&#146; with a representative of the working class. These productions dismayed Holland House, while providing the anti-emancipationists with ammunition. In April 1826 he was rewarded when, on the initiative of Edward Copleston, the University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of MA by diploma. He took up residence at Oxford in October 1826 as an honorary member of Oriel College.<br>
<br>Although Oxford seemed to offer White at last the status and repose he desired, his years there (1826&#150;32) were uneasy and creatively fallow. The university failed to give him useful employment and he came to resent his marginalization. Intellectually he found himself at home in the company of Richard Whately and his fellow <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45620/', "Noetics")</script> Baden Powell, Edward Hawkins, R. D. Hampden, and Nassau Senior. His friendship with the young J. H. Newman, with whom he shared &#145;grand and beautiful visions&#146;, was of a different order: a meeting of hearts rather than minds. They played the violin together and shared a passion for Beethoven. Under the influence of Whately and Senior, he now modified his political stance, and at the Oxford University by-election in 1829 came out in support of Peel and Catholic emancipation on the grounds of expediency, thereby alienating his former patrons. He was taken aback by Newman's militancy on behalf of the anti-Peel party, and by the discovery that Oxford was not immune from <i>odium theologicum</i>. Increasingly he spent more time in London, first as editor of the short-lived <span class="italic">London Review</span> (in which he published Newman's first literary article, on poetry) and then as tutor to Senior's son. Soon after Whately's appointment as archbishop of Dublin in 1832 he accepted an invitation to join him there.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears18321841"></a>Final years, 1832&#150;1841</h2>In Ireland, White led a retired life, tutoring Whately's son and translating Clairaut's <span class="italic">&Eacute;l&eacute;ments de g&eacute;om&eacute;trie</span> for use in the Irish national schools, &#145;in the hope of contributing to the great object of the education of the poor&#146;. In <span class="italic">The Law of Anti-Religious Libel Reconsidered</span> (1834) he gave incisive expression to his belief that the law had no place in the defence of religious truth. At Whately's request he re-entered the field of controversy as the anonymous author of <span class="italic">Second Travels of an Irish Gentleman</span> (1833), an apologia for protestantism in novelistic form, written as a riposte to Thomas Moore. Privately he was now in fact moving away from protestant orthodoxy towards a non-denominational Christianity. When Whately, fearful of being compromised, sounded a warning note, White left his household rather than sacrifice his &#145;mental independence&#146;. In January 1835 he moved to Liverpool, where his friend Clemente de Zulueta offered him hospitality.<br>
<br>White's new spiritual home was within the Unitarian community presided over by James Martineau, though he was personally closer to J. H. Thom, minister at the Renshaw Street Chapel, whom he chose to replace Whately as his literary executor. In 1835 he published what was intended to be his last theological testament, <span class="italic">Observations on Heresy and Orthodoxy</span>, in which he finally cut loose from church and dogma. It provoked a rift with Newman, whose campaign against Hampden he saw &#145;in a lurid and hellish light&#146; as a species of inquisition. In a review for the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> (January 1836, 204&#150;25), R. H. Froude adopted the deliberate tactic of treating the work as the logical outcome of liberal protestantism in order to cast doubt, by association, on the orthodoxy of Whately and Hampden.<br>
<br>Whately continued to support White with an annual subsidy of &pound;100, and in 1838 helped to secure for him a queen's bounty of &pound;300. In September 1839 White was visited by his cousin Luke Beck, now in charge of the family firm in Seville, who provided the &pound;1100 needed for the purchase of a captaincy in the 40th regiment of foot for Ferdinand White, then serving in India. The sympathetic company of Beck's young daughter, Maria Ana, moved him to write again in Spanish. Discarding the English persona which he had so long assumed, he wrote some of his finest verse with a new-found freedom and simplicity of style, as well as an unfinished novel, <span class="italic">Luisa de Bustamante</span>, in which he satirized the pretensions of the English middle class. Scorning the <i>via media</i>, he had come to regard moderation as a symptom of the English &#145;fear of going too far&#146;. Within the Unitarian community he lent his support to the establishment of the Liverpool Domestic Mission, whose programme of non-proselytizing philanthropy commended itself to his idealism. His health, always bad, rapidly deteriorated. In February 1841 he was moved from his cottage in Toxteth Park to William Rathbone's house at Greenbank, where he died on 20 May. His disciple Thom recorded his theological testimony: &#145;God to me is Jesus, and Jesus God&#151;of course, not in the sense of divines.&#146; He was interred in the cemetery adjoining the Renshaw Street Chapel.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandinfluence"></a>Reputation and influence</h2>White wrote many versions of his autobiography, but the only one that was confessional rather than apologetic, the &#145;Examination of Blanco by White&#146; (1818), remained unfinished and unpublished. In 1845 Thom published a three-volume <span class="italic">Life</span>&#151;an edition of two different autobiographical memoirs together with extracts from correspondence and journals, heavily weighted towards the subject's later life and theology. It had a catalytic effect, helping to impel some&#151;notably Newman and W. G. Ward&#151;over the Roman brink, while moving others, such as A. H. Clough, in a unitarian direction. But the impact was short-lived, and only the sonnet &#145;Night and Death&#146; survived the eclipse of his fame in England. In Spain the ultra-orthodox polymath Marcelino Men&eacute;ndez y Pelayo included White in his gallery of <i>heterodoxos</i> (<span class="italic">Historia de los heterodoxos espa&ntilde;oles</span>, 2, 1881), praising the style of <span class="italic">Letters from Spain</span> (which was not translated into Spanish until 1972) but branding the author as an archetypal apostate and <i>d&eacute;racin&eacute;</i>. In the 1970s White was rehabilitated by the emigr&eacute; scholar Vicente Llorens and the novelist Juan Goytisolo as a precursor of modern Spanish dissidence.<br>
<br>White spoke English with only the faintest trace of a foreign accent and, according to Dean Milman, was &#145;peculiarly prepossessing&#146; in conversation. His many close friendships survived his changes of religious allegiance. F. W. Newman described his head as being:<blockquote>of a very remarkable shape, like that which is ascribed to South American Indians, very narrow on the level of the eyes, but very lofty above them, and in appearance sloping up, almost like the gable of a house; but the aspect of his eyes was far more Spanish than Irish. (Quoted in Murphy, 231)</blockquote>Leigh Hunt noted the &#145;high sensitiveness and intelligence of his expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1949, 228) and his gentleness of manner, interrupted by sudden outbursts of vehemence. Although White attached most importance to his religious witness, his poetry, criticism, and journalism have outlasted his theology. His most enduring legacy has proved to be his life, read as a paradigm of the struggle to reconcile faith with doubt and reason with imagination.<br>
