</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lancaster,  Joseph</span>  (1778&#150;1838), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in Kent Street, Southwark, London, on 25 November 1778, the youngest son of Richard Lancaster (1742&#150;1821) a former soldier working as a cane sieve maker. Joseph's mother, Sarah Lancaster, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Faulkes (<i>d</i>. 1811), who had borne ten children, kept a small shop near St George's Fields. Lancaster received little formal education, attending local schools in Southwark and working for his father. The accounts of his early life are vague and contradictory. At the age of fourteen he attempted unsuccessfully to get to Jamaica as a naval volunteer &#145;to teach the poor blacks the word of God&#146;  (Corston, 2). Later he decided to become a dissenting minister and joined the Society of Friends, changing to teaching as the Quakers had no ministry. According to his first biographer, William Corston, Lancaster set up his first day school with the help of his father about 1798, after working as an assistant in other schools. This school moved into larger premises when numbers began to increase. He was well suited to be a schoolmaster as he had enormous enthusiasm, great self-confidence, a fluent tongue, and an instinctive understanding of young children, assets helped by a somewhat impressive appearance. He also possessed a capacity for self-advertisement which attracted help from local supporters. At a time when child labour was uncontrolled and parents expected their offspring to add to the meagre family income as soon as possible, such children as attended any school rarely stayed long or learned much. Lancaster had little difficulty on this score, as he provided free meals in addition to charging low fees.<h2>
<a name="BoroughRoadSchoolandthemonitorialsystem"></a>Borough Road School and the monitorial system</h2>About 1801 Lancaster established a &#145;free-school&#146; in a barn-like building near Borough Road, Southwark, advertising free instruction to those who could not afford to pay even a moderate fee. Before long the numbers of children at Lancaster's school were overwhelming and to avoid paying assistants he adopted the method whereby the older boys, the monitors (led by a monitor-general), taught the younger children under the general supervision of the master. What was forced on him by necessity was turned into an advantage and Lancaster set about proclaiming the effectiveness and cheapness of his monitorial plan. Many of his claims were exaggerated, not least his assertion that by his method a great proportion of children could finish their education in the &#145;three Rs&#146; in twelve months. Lancaster possessed considerable organizing powers. Some of his maxims, such as &#145;a place for everything and everything in its place&#146; and &#145;let every child at every moment have something to do and a motive for doing it&#146; became proverbial. A soldier's son, he sometimes compared his pupils to well disciplined troops and, like soldiers, his best monitors and pupils were rewarded with silver-plated badges worn on their caps or suspended by a chain. A keen rivalry was fostered among his pupils by an elaborate system of rewards, including toys or money for the diligent, while the mischievous, or unsuccessful, were dealt with by a system of humiliating penalties which were designed to expose the victim to the ridicule of his fellows. Lancaster's expenses were reduced by the device of using sand tables and slates instead of writing books, as well as sheets pasted on the walls instead of reading books. Groups of children, under the control of a monitor, learned the alphabet by repeating simple words, and practised figures. Passages extracted from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> or suitably pious books furnished scripture lessons. Lancaster himself was a keen reader and stressed the need for a good library.<br>
<br>By 1803 Lancaster's success in coping with several hundred boys simultaneously was attracting interest outside Southwark. The first of several editions of the book explaining his aims and describing his monitorial methods, <span class="italic">Improvements in Education as it Respects the Industrious Classes of the Community</span> (1803), was well subscribed. Eminent visitors from all over London came to see the remarkable school at Borough Road, many of them donating funds for the furtherance of the work. According to William Corston, &#145;foreign princes, ambassadors, peers, commons, ladies of distinction, bishops and archbishops, Jews and Turks, all visited the school with wonder-waiting eyes&#146;  (Corston, 11). Soon the attention of the prodigiously rich duke of Bedford and other nobility was directed to Lancaster's methods. The climax of interest in the school came in 1805 when Lancaster was given an audience by George III, who congratulated him on his achievement and donated a subscription of &pound;100 from himself and suitably graduated subscriptions from the rest of the royal family. No doubt some of the enthusiasm for Lancaster's school arose out of public curiosity to view an unusual and well-advertised spectacle. But there was also a genuine interest, for Lancaster appeared to have solved one of the social problems of the day&#151;how to provide a basic education for the rapidly increasing numbers of illiterate children in city streets without employing large numbers of teachers and great quantities of equipment. Most of the upper class believed that the children of the poor should at least be taught to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and learn habits of subordination and obedience. Witness George III's words to Lancaster, which were displayed in large letters in the schoolroom at Borough Road: &#145;It is my wish that every poor child in my dominions is taught to read the Holy Scriptures.&#146;<h2>
<a name="EstablishingLancasterianschools"></a>Establishing Lancasterian schools</h2>Lancaster was never known for his personal modesty (the Quaker reformer, Elizabeth Fry, noticed a want of humility in his manner) and the extent of his fame began to go to his head. He envisaged the foundation of monitorial schools all over the country erected in the image of what he now called the Royal Free School. He spent such funds as supporters donated to him in setting up at Borough Road a slate factory, a printing office, and a girls' school run by two sisters. He maintained his best monitors, his &#145;house lads&#146;, as apprentice schoolmasters, preparing them to go out like educational missionaries and start monitorial schools elsewhere. In <span class="italic">Improvements in Education</span>, he emphasized the importance of well trained and well remunerated teachers. On 5 June 1804 Lancaster married, in Sarah Trimmer's words, &#145;a pretty Quaker&#146;, Elizabeth Bonner (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1820), daughter of Henry Bonner of Southwark, and she gave him his only child, also named Elizabeth (Betsy). Soon after his marriage he set out on the first of a series of extravagant coach tours around the country, publicizing the merits of his system and whipping up a good deal of local enthusiasm. At Maiden Bradley in Wiltshire he established a rural monitorial school which for a time absorbed his interest and his money, though it eventually fell into neglect. After the first of several visits to Ireland in 1806, establishing schools, he returned to Southwark heavily in debt to local tradesmen and was confined in the king's bench debtors' prison. Even after his release the constant risk of being arrested again persuaded Lancaster to spend much of his time on lecturing tours in the provinces and Ireland, accompanied by some of his young apprentices, many of whom were devoted to him. Meanwhile the Borough Road monitorial school was left mainly in the hands of his assistants.<br>
<br>Financial difficulties, however, were not Lancaster's only problem. He had opened his school for children of all religious denominations and though the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was read diligently, no sectarian instruction was given. At first the Anglican clergy had donated subscriptions to the school, especially when it received royal approval. But this support changed into opposition when in 1805 Sarah Trimmer, after visits to Lancaster's school at Southwark, began to attack him in her correspondence and pamphlets as the &#145;Goliath of Schismatics&#146; and his school at Borough Road as inimical to the interests of the established church. Mrs Trimmer particularly attacked Lancaster's methods of &#145;emulation and reward&#146;, complaining that his medals and orders of merit for his &#145;nobility&#146; gave the children ideas above their station in life. She asserted that Lancaster had taken many of his ideas for his monitorial system from Dr Andrew Bell, whose Madras System, pioneered by Bell in India, was regarded favourably by the Anglican church. Lancaster had admitted his debt to Bell for some of his ideas and Bell had also professed his admiration for Lancaster's school. But after Mrs Trimmer's attack had divided their supporters, they drifted into hostility, widened by Bell's jealousy of the royal patronage given to Lancaster.<br>
<br>The Anglican attack helped to rally nonconformist and secular support to Lancaster, including a powerful defence of his system in the whig <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. In 1808 a small committee was formed to raise money to pay off his debts and put the finances and administration of the institutions at Borough Road on a sounder basis. The earliest of these supporters included Corston and Joseph Fox, a leading member of the Baptist sect. But the most influential member of the group was William Allen, a wealthy manufacturing chemist and well-known Quaker philanthropist, who was greatly impressed on his first visit to Borough Road in 1808. Allen, who became treasurer to the new committee, had friends in high places, including the royal dukes of Kent and Sussex. It was due to Allen more than to anyone else, that the Borough Road institutions were established on a permanent footing. But in spite of the financial support and economies of the committee, the need for funds remained pressing, especially as Lancaster's tours brought a demand for teachers of his monitorial system, the reputation of which was beginning to spread overseas, as well as throughout the British Isles. In 1810, therefore, an enlarged committee was formed under the presidency of the duke of Kent including, in addition to Allen and his friends, such educational enthusiasts as James Mill, Henry Brougham, and Samuel Whitbread, who had introduced a bill into parliament aiming to set up a national system of elementary schools based on Lancaster's system. This enlarged committee called itself the Royal Lancasterian Institution for the Education of the Poor of Every Religious Persuasion. Meanwhile the rival followers of Bell set up the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church, with the support of the tory <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and the Anglican clergy.<h2>
<a name="Resignation"></a>Resignation</h2>Between 1808 and 1811 Lancaster produced a number of pamphlets at The Royal Free School Press, including <span class="italic">The British System of Education</span> and <span class="italic">Report of J. Lancaster's Progress from the Year 1798</span>, recording fifty new schools for 14,000 pupils and acknowledging the financial assistance of his supporters. But he was, in fact, increasingly resentful of the control exercised by Allen and the committee. In 1812, without any reference to his trustees, he opened a boarding-school at Tooting for wealthy pupils, using money subscribed for Borough Road. He persuaded some of the apprentice schoolmasters to join him at Tooting and sent the committee a bill for their maintenance. Eventually after long and often acrimonious negotiations between Lancaster and the committee, a general meeting held at the Freemasons' Tavern in 1813 and attended by Lancaster and the leading members of the committee accepted a constitution and rules for the Institution for Promoting the British System for the Education of the Labouring and Manufacturing Classes of Society of Every Religious Persuasion. Lancaster was offered the position of salaried superintendent, the collapse of the Tooting project leaving him again heavily in debt. He agreed to these arrangements with reluctance accusing the leading members of the new society of usurping his authority and seizing his property. These arrangements soon came to an end, for in 1814 an unsavoury scandal made Lancaster's removal inevitable. According to Francis Place, who had joined the committee in 1812 and played a prominent part in its affairs for a time, a youth named William Brown, who was still apprenticed to Lancaster, informed Corston that Lancaster &#145;used to flog his apprentices for his own amusement&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27823). On the evidence of an inquiry into Lancaster's conduct towards his apprentices, which ran contrary to his moral pronouncements in <span class="italic">Improvements in Education</span>, he was called before the committee but forestalled further action by resigning as superintendent. Meanwhile he advertised a new monitorial school in Westminster to be financed by money sent to him by a supporter in Spain. After Lancaster's final withdrawal, the institution was renamed the British and Foreign School Society, much to the resentment of Lancaster who in <span class="italic">Oppression and Persecution</span> (1816) accused his &#145;pretended friends&#146;, Allen and Fox, of driving him away from the institutions he had created at Borough Road and excluding his name from the title of the society &#145;as if Britons and foreigners had combined in its invention&#146;. The Westminster project having collapsed, he resumed his travels around England, Ireland, and Scotland, lecturing on his monitorial system and establishing local committees. But his extravagance became increasingly wild. He had already been declared a bankrupt and disowned by the Society of Friends which disapproved of his spendthrift conduct and ostentatious appearance. His wife's mental illness had disrupted his family life. Eventually a few friends, including David Holt, a Quaker mill owner from Manchester, organized a subscription to pay for Lancaster's passage to America and in 1818 he crossed the Atlantic with his wife and daughter.<h2>
<a name="UnitedStatesandVenezuela"></a>United States and Venezuela</h2>Monitorial schools on the Lancasterian plan had already been set up in New York and Philadelphia and for a time Lancaster regained something of his old popularity. He was warmly welcomed by supporters in the United States and received by the president in Washington. But plans to establish model schools at Philadelphia and elsewhere collapsed because of Lancaster's ill health, his preference for lecture tours, and disputes over payment for himself and his assistants. Early in 1820 Lancaster moved to Baltimore where he opened another school and produced a treatise entitled <span class="italic">The Lancasterian System of Education with Improvements by its Founder</span> (1821). On 6 December 1820, however, his mentally afflicted wife, Elizabeth, died at Baltimore. Six years later, on 23 February 1827, he married Mary Robinson, the widow of an English miniature painter, John Robinson, who had emigrated to America. By that date Lancaster had left the United States and established himself at Caracas in the new state of Venezuela. Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, the president of Columbia (which then included Venezuela) had met Lancaster during a visit to Borough Road in 1810 and a proposal for a monitorial school at Caracas had already been made. Again, however, the results were disastrous, as problems of language, of religious instruction (for Catholicism was dominant in Caracas), and of finance inevitably arose. Relations between Lancaster and the British consul, who regarded him as an impostor and resented Lancaster's attitude to himself, rapidly deteriorated. After a brief period of cordial relations with Bol&iacute;var, who attended Lancaster's marriage to Mary Robinson in Caracas, Lancaster was abandoned by the &#145;liberator&#146;, being left heavily in debt. Both he and his second wife, who had three children by her first marriage, were obliged to leave Caracas at some personal risk to themselves. Meanwhile Lancaster's daughter, Elizabeth, had married Richard Jones, one of several former apprentices who had joined Lancaster in America and they had settled in Mexico with their family.<br>
<br>Back in the United States, Lancaster returned to New York and after visiting various cities on the north-eastern seaboard of America, established himself at Montreal in September 1829 where, as at other Canadian cities, he was at first welcomed, though his schools failed to flourish. During these years of increasing penury, he became virtually estranged from his wife, Mary, though she eventually rejoined him in the United States. On his return again to New York, some of his old friends, such as Roberts Vaux, tried to assist Lancaster and a subscription list was opened in America and Britain, to which Allen and other former supporters contributed, to purchase him an annuity. In 1833 he produced his last attempt at self-justification, <span class="italic">An epitome of some of the chief events and transactions in the life of Joseph Lancaster, containing an account of the rise and progress of the Lancasterian system of education and the author's future prospects of usefulness to mankind</span>. He also reopened correspondence with Corston in England, giving him the impression that he was still received everywhere with enthusiasm. &#145;With properly trained teachers and monitors&#146;, he wrote in 1838, &#145;I should not scruple to undertake to teach ten thousand pupils in different schools all to read fluently in three weeks to three months, idiots, absentees and truants excepted&#146;  (Salmon, 64). But shortly after writing this letter, he was seriously injured in a street accident in New York and died a day later, on 23 October 1838. He was buried at the Friends' burial-ground in Houston Street, New York.<br>
<br>&#145;Be assured I shall stand in my place here and hereafter,&#146; Lancaster wrote to an acquaintance in 1834  (McCadden, 73), when enthusiasm for monitorial methods was already declining, in spite of the original impact of the system of mutual instruction at home and abroad following the success of the Borough Road model school. Lancaster himself had become an increasing embarrassment over the years. Place's unkind dictum that Lancaster was &#145;adapted to the teaching in the school but to nothing else&#146; and became &#145;mischievous, ridiculous and childish&#146; as he was &#145;caressed by the great&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27823) was sadly true of a life which was mainly one of failed prospects, broken engagements, sordid quarrels, and endless debts. Even his relations with his own family deteriorated into mutual recriminations and neglect. &#145;That old serpent, Mr Lancaster,&#146; wrote the British minister in Caracas, &#145;is the most black and dangerous being in the place&#146;  (Dickson, 246) and this was an opinion shared by many acquaintances, though some few friends never lost faith in him. His biographer, David Salmon, was probably correct in suggesting that Lancaster's creative energy, which had achieved much for the children of the poorer classes, had been pretty well exhausted at thirty and it would have been better for his reputation if he had died many years earlier. Even so, his name was to survive in English educational history as one of the foremost pioneers of mass schooling and effective teacher training in the early industrial era.<br>
