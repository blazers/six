<span class="headword">Wilson,  Ernest Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Chinese Wilson]</span>  (1876&#150;1930), <span class="occ">plant collector and writer</span>, was born on 15 February 1876 in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, the eldest of the six children of Henry Wilson, railway worker, and his wife, Annie Curtis. The family moved to Shirley, Warwickshire, to set up a floristry business, and Wilson was educated at Shirley Schools, before being apprenticed at the Solihull nurseries of Messrs Hewitt. In 1893 he took up a post under W. B. Latham in the Birmingham Botanic Gardens, studying at the technical school in Birmingham, where he won the Queen's prize in botany. In 1897 he obtained a post at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and planned to enter Imperial College, London, with a studentship in 1898, intending to become a botany teacher. But instead he was chosen, at the recommendation of Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, to be a collector to bring back seed of the dove tree, <i>Davidia involucrata</i>, and worked at the Coombe Wood nursery of Harry Veitch, before leaving for China in 1899.<br>
<br>Wilson first went to Yunnan, to meet the collector Augustine Henry for details of the location of the only known specimen of <i>Davidia</i>. He then went up to Ichang (Yichang), which became his headquarters, and, since Henry's tree had been felled for timber, he located and collected <i>Davidia</i> material in Hupeh (Hubei). In England again, on 8 June 1902 he married Ellen 
    (Nellie; <i>c</i>.1872&#150;1930)
  , daughter of Edwin Ganderton, jobbing gardener, of Edgbaston, Warwickshire. From 1903 to 1904 he was in China again to collect the yellow poppy, <i>Meconopsis integrifolia</i>, returning to England in March with 510 seed samples and 2400 herbarium collections. In 1906 he was appointed botanical assistant at the Imperial Institute.<br>
<br>Wilson's success as a collector led to his being invited by C. S. Sargent of the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University to make another visit to China, in 1907&#150;9. During his last Chinese expedition in 1910, when he successfully introduced <i>Lilium regale</i>, he broke his leg when his palanquin was swept over in a landslide, and he was lamed for life (he called it his &#145;lily limp&#146;). In 1911 he returned to the arboretum at Harvard, helping in the preparation of <span class="italic">Plantae Wilsonianae</span>, which was edited in three volumes by Sargent (1911&#150;17) but partly written by A. Rehder and other specialists. During the First World War Sargent sent Wilson to Japan, principally to collect flowering cherries. He was shown the Kurume azaleas, which he later did much to popularize, and also collected in Korea and Taiwan. This second expedition yielded 30,000 specimens representing 3000 species. He was appointed assistant director of the Arnold Arboretum in 1919 and in 1920 travelled to Australia and New Zealand (where he criticized forestry policy in both), Java, Malaya, India, and tropical and South Africa, returning in 1922. After Sargent's death, Wilson was appointed keeper of the Arnold Arboretum in 1927.<br>
<br>Wilson wrote a large number of botanical and horticultural articles and books, his experiences in China being contained in <span class="italic">A Naturalist in Western China</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">Plant Hunting</span> (2 vols., 1927). These presented a rather rosy account of his travels, not dwelling on his exhaustion, his demoralization, or his high-handed attitude towards the Chinese, all of which are clear from his manuscript journals. Like many of his books, they were illustrated with his own photographs: he always carried a Sanderson plate camera and portable darkroom on his plant-hunting expeditions.<br>
<br>Wilson's chief contribution to botany and horticulture was in the exploration of China. A born collector, with good health, strong physique, great will-power, and a deep love of plants, &#145;Chinese Wilson&#146; probably brought more first-class woody plants into cultivation than has any other individual collector. He introduced more than a thousand species previously unknown in horticulture and made some 18,000 herbarium gatherings, the top set of which is preserved at Harvard. Besides bringing the <i>Davidia</i> into cultivation, his greatest introduction was perhaps <i>Lilium regale</i>, the most widely cultivated lily in the USA, nearly 7000 bulbs of which he arranged to have imported in 1910. Many other familiar garden plants were his introductions too, including <i>Artemisia lactiflora, Clematis armandii</i>, <i>Kolkwitzia amabilis</i> (beauty bush), <i>Lonicera nitida</i> (the common hedge-plant), <i>Malus hupehensis</i>, <i>Parthenocissus henryana</i>, <i>Rubus tricolor</i>, and <i>Sinacalia (Senecio) tangutica</i>, and numerous cherries, lilacs, maples, and species of <i>Berberis</i>, <i>Primula</i>, <i>Rhododendron</i>, and <i>Viburnum</i>, as well as the Chinese gooseberry (or kiwi fruit), <i>Actinidia deliciosa</i>, later a major fruit crop. Wilson's major misfortune was that the firm of Veitch declined rapidly before 1914, when the stock was sold off before many of his new plants had been propagated or distributed; the Arnold Arboretum had fewer difficulties with his later collections. Apparently never close to the Chinese (he never learned the language and travelled in some style with a large retinue of porters), he wrote little about the people and rather drily on the landscape and plants. Indeed he was relaxed only among close friends, but in later life he was much in demand as a lecturer in the USA.<br>
<br>Besides several gold medals for his services to horticulture, notably the Veitch memorial medal (1906) and the Victoria medal of honour (1916) of the Royal Horticultural Society, Wilson received an honorary MA from Harvard (1916) and an honorary DSc from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut (1930); he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. A genus of trees, <i>Sinowilsonia</i>, is named after him, and about sixty species and varieties of plants also bear his name, notably <i>Magnolia wilsonii</i>. He and his wife (who had suffered ill health all her life) were killed in a car crash near Worcester, Massachusetts, on 15 October 1930. They were survived by their daughter, Muriel Primrose (<i>b</i>. 1906). Their cremated remains were buried in Mount Royal cemetery, Montreal, at her request, on &#145;British&#146; soil. In 1984 the Wilson Garden was set up in Chipping Campden as a memorial to him.<br>
