<span class="headword">Moberly,  Mary</span>  (1853&#150;1940), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born at Rugby, Warwickshire, daughter of the Revd Charles Edward Moberly (1821?&#150;1893), clergyman, schoolmaster, and author, and Catherine Temple (<i>b</i>. 1812), elder sister of Frederick Temple, headmaster of Rugby School and archbishop of Canterbury. Most of her early life was spent in Rugby, where her father was assistant master at the school, and it is likely that she was educated at home. She passed five Cambridge higher local examinations before entering Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1878, where she had a distinguished career and was made Drapers' scholar in 1879. A pupil of Professor Sidgwick, she gained distinctions in logic and political economy, and a first class in the moral sciences tripos in 1881. She was an associate of Newnham from 1893 to 1903.<br>
<br>From Newnham Moberly followed many of her peers in becoming a teacher in one of the new girls' academic high schools. Her career began in 1882 as assistant mistress at Notting Hill high school, London, which had developed into a <i>de facto</i> training institution for future headmistresses. After only a year she was appointed by the Girls' Public Day School Company to open their new school at Tunbridge Wells as its first headmistress. Under her leadership the school grew from twenty-two pupils to a full range of years from kindergarten to sixth form. In 1891 she was transferred to Gateshead high school. There she had a particularly difficult task, facing falling rolls as a result of the economic situation at Gateshead and competition from other local schools. The company's response to the latter was to upgrade the Gateshead school's preparatory department in nearby Newcastle upon Tyne to a full high school, and within three years Moberly was entrusted with the headship of the new Central Newcastle high school, which opened in January 1895. When Gateshead was finally merged with the Newcastle school in 1907 she was appointed head of the new school, and remained there until her retirement.<br>
<br>In building up the Central Newcastle school Moberly gathered round her a number of excellent teachers, some of whom had been with her at Gateshead. She kept up good relations with her old school, and it was thanks to her statesmanship that the merger was implemented with so little friction. The new school lacked facilities and there was much making do in the early years. Despite the difficulty of having no laboratories science was on the curriculum from the beginning. The school developed as an all-round institution, with a concentration on games and drama; it was described as having an overall light-heartedness. Moberly was no autocrat but a strong supporter of self-government who believed in training the girls to be self-reliant for themselves and for the school. One of her main innovations, soon after the school's foundation, was the introduction of a prefect system, followed some years later by elected form captains. She stated that she wished to make the school more like a civic organization and genuinely alive. Her successor said that she had built into the school &#145;some share of her own integrity, tolerance and generosity&#146;  (Carter, 35).<br>
<br>Moberly was tall and slim, with a long narrow face and high forehead; she wore spectacles and was impeccably dressed. It was said of her that she was made up of &#145;the academic, the episcopal and the Liberal&#146;  (Carter, 33). She was a deep-thinking scholar, with a fine mind and a precision in her conversation that some found daunting. In many ways she seemed more suited to the libraries of Cambridge than to a girls' school in the north of England&#151;yet she had a strong feeling for the north east, and after her retirement stayed in Newcastle for the rest of her life. She was a devoted churchwoman, with a genuine and profound Christian belief that permeated everything she did. Unlike many of her contemporaries she does not appear to have played any public role in education. A mix of many elements, she roused different emotions in those who knew her. To some she was austere and difficult to get to know or understand, a solemn woman who rarely smiled; to others she was a remarkable woman of vivid personality, warm-hearted, understanding, and gentle, inspiring love and gratitude in former pupils and staff. Her generosity to those in need was unstinted, and many girls were thus given chances that they would otherwise have lacked. She was broad-minded but at the same time had very high mental and moral standards. (These did not extend to remedying her own chronic lack of punctuality.)<br>
<br>Moberly retired in 1911, aged fifty-eight. She became totally blind and was cared for by her companion and former school secretary, Blanche Edith Dixon. She died of heart failure and a stroke at her home, 28 Lansdowne Gardens, Jesmond, Newcastle, on 4 August 1940; she was buried in St Andrew's cemetery, Newcastle, on 7 August.<br>
