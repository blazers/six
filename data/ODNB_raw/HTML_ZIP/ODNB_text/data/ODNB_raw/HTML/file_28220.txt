<span class="headword">Verelst,  Simon Pieterszoon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1644, <em>d.</em> 1710<span class="mult">x</span>17), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was baptized in The Hague on 21 September 1644. He was the second son of Adriana van Gesel (<i>d</i>. before 1657) and Pieter Harmenszoon Verelst (<i>fl</i>. 1618&#150;1668), originally from Dordrecht. Pieter had joined the painters' guild at The Hague in 1643: in 1663 Simon and his brother Harmen paid their first dues to the same guild. Simon was in London by 11 April 1669, when he met Pepys, who was entranced by one of his flower paintings (&#145;a better picture I never saw in my whole life, and it is worth going twenty miles to see&#146;; Pepys, 9.515). Early flower pieces by Verelst show that Pepys's praise was justified. De Lairesse singled him out as the finest flower painter of the seventeenth century, and Weyerman called him &#145;a painter in a thousand&#146;  (Weyerman, 248). Most of his best pictures, however, were made early in his career; the poor quality pigments he had to use in London did not improve his work. Nevertheless, he quickly established himself as the leading still-life specialist in London, and he also made portraits, with great financial (but middling artistic) success. He painted <i>inter alia</i> the duke of Buckingham, the duchess of Norfolk, the duchess of Portsmouth, Charles II, Nell Gwyn (several times, clothed and nude), James II, and Mary of Modena. When he married Ann Pember at St Mary's, Marylebone, on 2 December 1684, he was said to be the best-paid artist in London. This success was ended in the following year by an attack of &#145;frenzy&#146;. The story of Verelst's madness and the state of laughable self-conceit which supposedly preceded it is often repeated in the literature, but this suspiciously entertaining tale owes its existence solely to Weyerman, whose trustworthiness is usually doubted by art historians. The behaviour they describe would today be thought symptomatic of bipolar affective disorder (manic depression). Before he lost his senses completely, it is said that Verelst stopped sleeping, gave up work, and went on long solitary walks; he then, apparently, bought a velvet cape, varnished his hat and shoes, and started calling himself the God of Flowers and King of Portrait-painters. In this state, he went to the palace of Whitehall, demanding that the king of England should come to speak with the King of Painters. The idea of Verelst varnishing his hat and shoes was taken by Weyerman from Karel van Mander's life of Joos van Cleef, and the rest of the tale may reasonably be doubted. However, Verelst does seem to have gone mad; about 1685, according to his brother-in-law, one Mr Rothwell junior:<blockquote>he shutt the doore &amp; drew his Sword &amp; swore he would kill me&#151;I pulled off my Coate &amp; I bid him not strike to hard&#151;and I must he said bring my wife to him to whip her and bring 4 Rods with me&#151;to whip my wife&#151;he has beene distracted&#151;he has run about the street in his shirt and cutt his feet&#151;I never dust goe neere Varelst since I have seen him but never was in a Roome with him. (minutes of the House of Lords, 5 Feb 1692)</blockquote>The madness subsided but his days as a high-society portraitist were over. It seems that his marriage also ended: in 1692, when he appeared before the House of Lords as a witness in divorce proceedings between the duke and duchess of Norfolk, he was described as a bachelor. His testimony on that occasion was discounted, after Rothwell's evidence of his insanity. Weyerman claimed that his talents as a flower painter were also ruined by his madness. This is hard to assess, since no dated paintings are known between 1672 and 1709. One of the 1709 pictures is depressingly inept (ex Christies, London, 8 December 1995, lot 211) but another, a simple painting of a bunch of grapes (ex Christies, Amsterdam, 9 November 1998, lot 38), is worthy of his work in the 1670s. It seems, though, that Verelst's financial situation deteriorated; in 1692 he was &#145;lodged at Mr Cowell's, an Housekeeper&#146;  (minutes of the House of Lords) in Fleet Street, and about 1710, according to Weyerman, he was &#145;lodged, or rather chained in the galley, at a London art dealer named Lovejoy, resident in the Strand&#146;  (Weyerman, 250). Weyerman claimed that Verelst's work at this period was strikingly inept, with flowers grotesquely distorted in size and colouring, but this is probably an exaggeration. Another Dutchman, Allard de la Court, met the artist in June 1710, and wrote that he:<blockquote>asked me if I would like to see his art, [and said] that I would never have seen anything comparable in Holland or Italy, but when I saw the same it fell a long way short, it was badly painted. He nevertheless dared ask &pound;100 for a small piece, a very bad flower piece. (Roever, 71)</blockquote>This is not the only contemporary testimony to suggest that Verelst was deluded about the quality of his late work. Vertue was told by Pieter Casteels that:<blockquote>Simon Verelst dyd at his house in Suffolk street near the haymarkett. he showd a historical picture he had been painting 20 years over &amp; over at several times wherein (he sayd) was to be seen Raphael, Titian, Rubens and Vandyke in their several manners. (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.42)</blockquote>This passage of Vertue's notebooks was written in the second half of 1716 or the first half of 1717, so Verelst cannot have died in 1721, as is frequently claimed. The registers of St Martin-in-the-Fields and the parishes between Ludgate and Piccadilly do not appear to record his date of burial, unless he was the Simon Evret buried at St Martin's on 6 December 1713.<br>
<br>Verelst's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_28220"></a><span class="headword">Harmen Verelst</span>  (<em>b. </em>1639<span class="mult">x</span>42, <em>d.</em> in or after 1691), was a <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>. His birth date is deduced from information that his father was said to be a bachelor in 1638 and his younger sister, Helena, was baptized in January 1643. A later date in the range seems preferable, however, because Harmen Verelst enrolled in the St Luke's Guild in the same year as his younger brother, Simon. He married Cicilia Fene, a Venetian, in 1667 in Amsterdam, and worked between Amsterdam and The Hague until about 1678. He then travelled to Rome via Ljubljana, after which he spent three years in Vienna. He moved together with his family to London in 1683, perhaps fleeing the Turkish siege of Vienna in that year. He and Cicilia had at least five children: Peter, Adriana, John, Richard, and Lewis. Lewis, who died young in 1704, left a will which provides most of our evidence about the family members. Weyerman claimed that Harmen and Cicilia also had a son called Cornelis and a daughter called Maria; Lewis's will mentions neither. Cornelis may not have existed at all, while Maria (1680&#150;1744), a portraitist known as Mrs Verelst, presumably (from her title) married into the family. Harmen's death date is uncertain; Vertue maintained that he died about 1700 and was buried in St Andrew's, Holborn, but he does not appear in the burial registers of that church between 1691 and 1704. His latest surviving dated work was made in 1691; Vertue claimed to have seen a work made in 1693. <a name="cosubject_74502"></a><span class="headword">John Verelst</span>  (<em>c.</em>1675&#150;1734), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was probably the son of Harmen. Confusion arises because another John Verelst was father of two children in London in 1674 and 1682: this may have been Harmen's and Simon's brother, Johannes (<i>b</i>. 1648), whose profession is unknown. However, the painter John Verelst was most likely Harmen's son, as mentioned in the will of Lewis. His first surviving dated work was made in 1704. He and his wife, Anne, had at least seven children: Herman, Cicely, Adriana, George, James, Robert (father of Harry, governor of Bengal), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28223/', "William Verelst (bap. 1704, d. 1752)")</script>: this latter was also a portrait painter. John was buried on 10 March 1734 in the parish of St Christopher-le-Stocks, London.<br>
