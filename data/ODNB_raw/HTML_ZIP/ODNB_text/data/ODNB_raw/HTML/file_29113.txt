<span class="headword">Westgarth,  William</span>  (1815&#150;1889), <span class="occ">merchant and politician in Australia</span>, was born on 15 June 1815 at Edinburgh, the eldest son of John Westgarth, surveyor-general of customs for Scotland, and his wife, Christian Thomson. The Westgarths were a landed family from Weardale, co. Durham. William attended high schools at Leith and Edinburgh and Dr Bruce's academy at Newcastle upon Tyne. On leaving school he entered the mercantile firm of George Young &amp; Co., Leith.<br>
<br>In July 1840 Westgarth emigrated to Port Phillip district, Australia, and arrived in Melbourne on 13 December. &#145;The grand bent of all is the making of money&#146;, he wrote on Christmas eve to his mother, &#145;and I do think some is to be made here.&#146; Within two years, however, as an important merchant he was caught in a depression and settled with his creditors. He soon recovered, and formed a prosperous partnership with Alfred Ross in 1845. An &#145;improver&#146;, Westgarth was an unostentatious and indefatigable supporter of good causes such as the Mechanics' Institute and the benevolent society. In 1844 he began his prolific writing career with his first book, <span class="italic">Observations on the present commercial, agricultural and civil condition of the Australian colonies</span>, published at Leith, and the first of a series of six-monthly commercial and statistical reports on the progress of Port Phillip. In 1846 he reported sympathetically on the &#145;condition, capabilities, and prospects&#146; of the Aborigines. During a prolonged absence on business in Britain in 1847&#150;9 he persuaded the imperial authorities to subsidize the emigration of German rural workers; the first few arrived in Port Phillip in 1848.<br>
<br>On his return Westgarth soon became one of the two or three most respected men in the infant colony. He was a campaigner for separation from New South Wales, the Melbourne secretary of the League for the Abolition of Transportation, and a leading spokesman for the broad radical front, including many Scottish businessmen, opposing Lieutenant-Governor C. J. La Trobe and the conservative, largely Anglican, official class. He topped the poll for Melbourne at the first election for the Victorian legislative council in 1851, campaigned to unlock the lands, and carried the <span class="roman">Convicts Prevention Act</span> (to exclude criminals from Van Diemen's Land). He formed the Melbourne chamber of commerce almost single-handedly, and acted as its first president. He also helped to draw up a straightforward free-trade tariff and proposed a uniform Australian tariff. Soon he became an almost automatic choice to chair important public meetings.<br>
<br>Westgarth was again in Britain in 1853&#150;4 on business and to find a wife; he married Ellison, the daughter of John Macfie, on 6 June 1854 in Edinburgh. It was unfortunate that he was absent for the debates on the Victorian draft constitution. He did not rejoin the legislative council, but chaired the commission of inquiry into the goldfields of Victoria after the Eureka rebellion. The wise report, forced on Governor Sir Charles Hotham by public opinion, recommended an export duty on gold in place of a licence fee, a cheap miner's right which included the vote, and creation of local courts. Affable, modest, urbane, and, above all, tolerant, Westgarth was the complete liberal free-trader for whom Adam Smith was gospel and belief in progress towards the greater happiness of humankind axiomatic. He was also the complete democrat, supporting manhood suffrage, the secret ballot, state education, abolition of state aid to religion&#151;even direct taxation of the wealthy. Yet he was not of the stuff of which popular politicians are made, being a rather tedious speaker, though convivial and a natural peacemaker.<br>
<br>Late twentieth-century Australian historians describe Westgarth as &#145;the John Stuart Mill of Victoria&#146;, &#145;the outstanding sociological thinker of the colonies&#146;, and &#145;the most perceptive of early Australian historians&#146;. His political-historical writing is a landmark in early Australian intellectual history. Though unpretentious and hurriedly written, his five books on Victoria and his <span class="italic">Australia: its Rise, Progress, and Present Condition</span> (1861) are distinguished by his probings for explanations of historical change and by generalizations of some profundity about the nature of colonial society.<br>
<br>In 1857 Westgarth left Victoria to establish a sharebroking firm in London, specializing in advice on colonial loans, and carried out innumerable minor diplomatic tasks for colonial governments. A founder of the Colonial Institute in 1869, he gave the first paper to its first ordinary meeting, and many more later, and was the institute's auditor for twenty years. Westgarth was one of the preliminary committee of six which founded the Imperial Federation League in 1884. He frequently presented papers at meetings of the British Association and the Social Science Congress on such matters as bimetallism and land taxation, and was prominent in the foundation of the London chamber of commerce in 1881. He interested himself in economic theory, and in 1887 published a <span class="italic">Sketch of the Nature and Limits of a Science of Economics</span>. He also became engrossed in the problems of poverty and social inequality.<br>
<br>Westgarth returned to Victoria only once, in 1888 for the centennial celebrations, and met with a great reception. In mid-1889, in declining health, he retired from business. He died on 28 October, when he fell from the attic window of 10 Bolton Gardens, South Kensington, his London home; the inquest recorded accidental death. His funeral took place in Edinburgh. Westgarth had taken &pound;100,000 from his business on retirement and left a considerable estate. He had been a member of the Church of Scotland and held regular morning prayers in his household. His wife and three daughters survived him; the firm of Westgarth &amp; Co. failed in 1890.<br>
