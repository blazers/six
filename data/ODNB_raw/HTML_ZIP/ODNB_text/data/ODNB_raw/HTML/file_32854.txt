<span class="headword">Donald, Sir  John Stewart</span>  (1861&#150;1948), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at Ferozepore, Punjab, on 8 September 1861, the son of Alexander John Stewart Donald (<i>b</i>. 1824), an Anglo-Indian in the Punjab provincial service, and his wife, Susan Britten (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1830), daughter of William Edward Hilliard. He was educated at Bishop Cotton School, Simla, and in April 1882 entered the Punjab provincial service.<br>
<br>Initially posted to Ambala and Ludhiana, Donald was soon transferred to Dera Ghazi Khan on the north-west frontier. By 1885 his work there had attracted the attention of Robert Sandeman, who recruited him to implement his aggressive forward policy in Baluchistan. In 1890 Donald was put in charge of the newly opened Gomal pass in southern Waziristan and in the autumn of that year was attached to the Kidderzai column of the Shirani field force to pacify the Largha&#150;Shirani territory, for which service he was admitted to the imperial civil service. This was a rare privilege for an Anglo-Indian, and in praising him in later years Donald's superiors would never quite be able to hide their surprise that one so humbly born had done so well.<br>
<br>In August 1893 Donald accompanied Mortimer Durand's mission to Kabul to negotiate the Indo-Afghan frontier and in the following year was charged with demarcating the southern, Waziristan, and Kurram section of the frontier. Good-humoured patience aided his success and he was created CIE and awarded, from the Afghan side, the Izzat-i-Afghani.<br>
<br>After eighteen months' furlough in 1896&#150;7, Donald was appointed to Hoshiarpur, Miran Shah, and, from 1900, Bannu, a district bordering Waziristan in which the Mahsuds and Wazirs had proved less tractable than the more southern tribes of Baluchistan. In 1903 he served as British commissioner on the Anglo-Afghan boundary commission on the Kurram and Waziristan borders, following which he took his second furlough to Britain, where on 4 January 1905, in London, he married Henrietta Mary (<i>d</i>. 1955), daughter of Colonel Edward Lacon Ommanney of the Indian political service. He returned to India in late 1905, and was appointed deputy commissioner of Hazara.<br>
<br>In 1908, at the recommendation of Sir George Roos-Keppel, Donald became the first resident of Waziristan. In 1910 he again served on the Afghan boundary commission, for which he was made CSI in 1911. From August 1913 to January 1915 he officiated for Roos-Keppel as chief commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province. He was sceptical about the efficacy of the residency system and frequently urged the full occupation of the Mahsuds' territory in Waziristan, arguing that from a distance the British could not protect the individuals who were inclined to assist them. In spite of his criticism, however, he faithfully adhered to the government's haphazard &#145;carrot and stick&#146; system of tribal allowances and punitive fines, generally adopting a wait-and-see approach to tribal incursions, and counselling against over-hasty punishment.<br>
<br>In 1915 Roos-Keppel succeeded in getting a KCIE for Donald, even though the political department thought that he had already been amply decorated. He was due to retire in September 1916 but under wartime conditions stayed on as resident of Waziristan and additional member of the central legislative council. In 1917 he was appointed chief political officer with the Waziristan field force operating against the Mahsuds.<br>
<br>Not one of the big names on the frontier, Donald nevertheless commanded the respect of his colleagues and also apparently that of the Mahsuds and Wazirs, who knew him simply as Dollan. Calm, measured, and fluent in Waziri Pushtu, he was able to gauge the tone and intent of a <i>jirga</i> or tribal gathering before committing himself to action. He had a reputation for modesty but took pride in the service. He retired in 1920 and, having never lived for any length of time in Britain, settled first in Jersey and then in Cyprus, where he died in Amiandos Hospital on 30 July 1948. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1955, and a younger son and two daughters.<br>
