<span class="headword">Boyd,  Robert, of Trochrig</span>  (1578&#150;1627), <span class="occ">theological writer and poet</span>, was born in Glasgow, the son of James Boyd of Trochrig, archbishop of Glasgow (<i>d</i>. 1581) and his wife, Margaret Chalmers, daughter of James Chalmers, baron of Gaithgirth. Robert was about three years old when his father died and his mother took him and his younger brother, Thomas, to live at Trochrig in Ayrshire. Educated at Ayr grammar school, he studied divinity at Edinburgh University with Robert Rollock, the principal, and philosophy with Charles Ferme, graduating MA about 1594; fellow students included John Murray, Robert Scot, and James Watson. He decided to continue his education abroad, and sailed to Dieppe on 1 May 1597. From there he made his way to Orl&eacute;ans, staying in the house of a Monsieur Gris, settled in Tours for a year, and then spent eight months in Bordeaux before moving to Poitiers. On a visit to Montauban he met Monsieur de Dismes, professor at the protestant university there. His new friend persuaded him to stay, and he taught philosophy at Montauban for the next five years. He lectured for four hours each day, continued his studies in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and at night read divinity, permitting himself very little sleep. <br>
<br>It had always been Boyd's desire to enter the church, and in September 1604 he moved to Verteuil, where he was ordained as pastor of the Reformed church on 9 November. His friends in the academic world were anxious not to lose him, however, and in April 1605 his congregation agreed to release him so that he could go to Saumur to be both pastor and professor of philosophy at the protestant university. In 1608 he was given the chair of divinity. He twice visited Scotland during this period, but he felt that his future lay in France and in May 1611 he married Anna (<i>d</i>. in or before 1654), daughter of Sir Peter de Maliverne of &#145;Vineola&#146;. <br>
<br>Three years later Boyd's happy family life was disturbed when he received a message from James VI and I instructing him to return to Scotland to be principal of Glasgow University. Although reluctant he could not refuse the royal command and he and his family left Saumur on 2 October 1614. He had agreed to a year's trial at Glasgow, where, as well as being principal, he taught theology, Hebrew, and Syriac and was minister at Govan. Admired in Saumur for his fluent French sermons he impressed his Scottish students, like John Livingston, and subordinates like Robert Blair, with his extempore lectures in flowing Latin, as well as his encyclopaedic knowledge of theology, and his personal kindness. His commentary on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Ephesians</span>, in progress while he was in France but published only after his death, as <span class="italic">Robert Bidii &hellip; in epistolam Pauli Apostoli ad Ephesios</span> (1652), was a vast work of astonishing learning, and he also wrote excellent Latin poetry, some of which was published in <span class="italic">Hetacombe Christiana</span> (1627) and translated by Sir William Mure in <span class="italic">A Spirituall hymne</span> (1628). <br>
<br>His first year satisfactorily accomplished, Boyd agreed to stay on at Glasgow, but as time passed he became embroiled in the controversy over whether the Church of Scotland should have bishops. He believed that it should not. James VI and I was angry when he opposed the five articles of Perth, and in 1621 Boyd resigned, retiring to Trochrig. In October 1622, however, he was invited to become principal of Edinburgh University and minister of Greyfriars church. He accepted, but as soon as James VI heard he wrote to the provost, bailies, and town council of Edinburgh telling them, &#145;we think his byding ther will do much evil and therefor &hellip; we command you to put him not only from his office but out of your town &hellip; unless he conform totally&#146;  (Wodrow, 189). Boyd refused to comply, and was deprived. <br>
<br>Back in Ayrshire, Boyd was in 1624 given hopes that he might be restored to his position as principal at Glasgow, but although he signed a qualified declaration of conformity he was not allowed to return. Instead, on 18 December 1625, he accepted an invitation to become minister of Paisley. Even there, however, he was not to have a peaceful life. He had always maintained a wide-ranging correspondence, which he continued, but while one relative, Lady Boyd, wrote to thank him for his care for her spiritual welfare, another was less appreciative. Marion Boyd, the widowed countess of Abercorn, had recently converted to Roman Catholicism. At her urging her second son, Claud, Lord Strabane, broke into Boyd's house, scattering his beloved books and hurling his furnishings into the street. Horrified, Boyd retreated once more to Trochrig and at the end of 1626 fell seriously ill with a painful swelling in his throat, caused by cancer. He travelled to Edinburgh to consult doctors, but died three weeks later, on 5 January 1627 at the age of forty-eight, leaving books worth &pound;1551 and a reputation as &#145;a very learned and holy man, eminent both in the school and the pulpit&#146;  (John Row, in Wodrow, 241). Andr&eacute; Rivet, brother-in-law of Pierre du Moulin and professor of theology at Leiden, who had known him since his time in France, wrote a sympathetic life, which was in turn a source of Robert Wodrow's biography.<br>
