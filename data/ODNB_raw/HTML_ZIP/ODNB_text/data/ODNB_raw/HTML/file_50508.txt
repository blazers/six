<span class="headword">Mavor,  James</span>  (1854&#150;1925), <span class="occ">political economist</span>, was born on 8 December 1854 in Stranraer, Wigtownshire, the eldest of nine children of the Revd James Mavor (1828&#150;1879), a teacher from New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Mary Ann Taylor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bridie (1828&#150;1896), of Dundee. The family moved to Glasgow in 1862 and James, as the eldest son, left school to go to work. Evening classes at Anderson's College and some lectures at the University of Glasgow finished his formal education. His international academic stature was thus attained without benefit of an earned degree.<br>
<br>Early friendship with the physicist and inventor William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) led to a thirst for science rare among men of arts and letters. At one time Mavor was both editor of the <span class="italic">Scottish Art Review</span> and Scottish editor of the technology magazine <span class="italic">Industries</span>. Entering business in Glasgow he saw the social effects of pell-mell industrialization, and with the town planner Patrick Geddes pioneered housing for the poor. With his lifelong friend William Morris he co-signed the founding manifesto of the Socialist League, but wary of socialism's authoritarian bent he soon broke with it.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1882 Mavor married Christina Jane Gordon Balfour Watt (1850&#150;1933), a Glasgow music teacher. They had three children, all of whom achieved distinction: James Watt Mavor, a leading biologist in the USA; Dora Mavor Moore, Canadian theatre pioneer; and Brigadier Wilfrid Mavor.<br>
<br>When appointed professor of political economy and statistics at St Mungo's College in 1889, Mavor already had close contacts with co-operative, union, suffragist, and Ruskinite groups in Britain; with economists in France, Germany, and America; and, through the Glasgow Fabian Society, with Pease, the Webbs, and G. B. Shaw&#151;who sparred with him by naming Candida's social activist husband &#145;The Rev. James Mavor Morell&#146;. London friends included the editor W. T. Stead, the critic Arthur Symons, the poet W. B. Yeats, and the &eacute;migr&eacute; Russian biologist and anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin. Mavor's reports on British railways solidified his academic reputation, and by 1892, when he left for Canada, he was counted among the leading British economists.<br>
<br>As head of the department of political economy at the University of Toronto, Mavor quickly became a catalyst in Canadian cultural and economic affairs. He championed art galleries, museums, theatre, and workers' education. His report of 1904 for the British government, <span class="italic">North West of Canada</span>, dampening prospects for wheat export, became notorious in both nations. Kropotkin enlisted his aid in Tolstoy's plan to resettle Russia's oppressed Dukhobors in the Canadian west, a massive project that claimed his attention for decades. Before the First World War, Mavor had travelled through much of Canada, Europe, China, Mongolia, and Japan as an adviser to various governments, and had written (after teaching himself Russian and visiting Tolstoy) his seminal <span class="italic">Economic History of Russia</span> (2 vols., 1914).<br>
<br>In Toronto, Mavor's department spawned others: political science, economy, statistics, sociology, commerce and finance. The communications prophet Harold Innis was among his professorial appointments, and his students became notable in many fields. In 1912 the university made him an honorary PhD. His autobiography, <span class="italic">My Windows on the Street of the World</span>, appeared in two volumes in 1923, and <span class="italic">The Russian Revolution</span> posthumously in 1926. He died on 31 October 1925 while visiting Glasgow, and was buried there. The playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34950/', "James Bridie (Osborne Henry Mavor, 1888&#150;1951)")</script> was a nephew.<br>
