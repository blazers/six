<span class="headword">Lewis,  Angelo John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Professor Hoffmann]</span>  (1839&#150;1919), <span class="occ">journalist and writer on magic</span>, was born on 23 July 1839 at Crescent Place, St Pancras, London, the son of John Lewis, a coal merchant, and his wife, Victorie Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Calkin. He was educated at North London Collegiate School and Wadham College, Oxford, where he took a BA and an MA. He then went on to study law, and in 1861 was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, where he practised until 1876. He married Mary Ann Avery, the daughter of Joseph Avery, of Stollarks Crescent, St Pancras, on 12 May 1864 at St Mark's Church in the same parish; they had one daughter, Maud.<br>
<br>During his undergraduate years at Oxford, Lewis became interested in magic and witnessed the performances of the famous magician John Henry Anderson, the &#145;Great Wizard of the North&#146;. Although he did little to develop this interest while at Oxford, his enthusiasm revived during the 1860s, apparently after seeing the &#145;very clever performance of a street conjurer&#146;  (Reynolds, vi). He then began to collect books and apparatus relating to magic and gave amateur performances. In 1876, the year in which he retired from the law, he published <span class="italic">Modern Magic</span> under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Professor Hoffmann. The book became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> since it revealed closely guarded secrets of the conjuror's profession that had been handed down for generations, usually by word of mouth. In his introductory chapter, Lewis stated that &#145;there is a vast difference between telling how a trick is done and teaching how to do it&#146;  (p. vii), a comment which challenged previous approaches to teaching magic, excepting, of course, those techniques revealed by Jean Eug&egrave;ne Robert-Houdin's <span class="italic">Comment on devient sorcier: les secrets de la prestidigitation</span> (1878?), a volume which Professor Hoffmann went on to translate and publish in 1878. <span class="italic">Modern Magic</span> sparked further controversy for more general reasons relating to the precarious foundation upon which conjuring rested. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> was moved to &#145;wonder whether this &hellip; sleight-of-hand is only valuable to conjurers and pickpockets!&#146;  (13 Oct 1877, 465). Regardless of the criticism, Professor Hoffmann wrote on 14 July 1877 to his uncle that &#145;the book has had the good fortune to be rather a hit&#146;. In its first edition it sold 2000 copies, at the price of 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., &#145;in a little over six weeks&#146;  (Stott, 136). Raymond Toole Stott observed that Hoffmann's influence was such that &#145;the quantity and quality of trick and illusion has been most marked and conjurers have risen quickly in the estimation of the thinking portion of the public&#146;  (Stott, 13).<br>
<br>Using his real name, Lewis also wrote fiction for various journals, including <span class="italic">Belgravia</span> (1884&#150;5), <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Leisure Hour</span> (1884), <span class="italic">London Society</span> (1885&#150;6), the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> (1886&#150;7), <span class="italic">Living Age</span> (1893), and the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, where he was on the staff from about 1855 to 1866. Under his pseudonym he went on to write nearly forty articles and volumes on matters relating to magic, as well as his other hobbies, card games and chess. They included <span class="italic">More Magic</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Puzzles Old and New</span> (1894), &#145;Indian conjuring explained&#146; (in <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, 1901), <span class="italic">Later Magic</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Hoyle's Games Modernized</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">Tricks with Handkerchiefs</span> (1911).<br>
<br>In 1903 Lewis moved from London to St Leonards, and then in 1915 to Bexhill, in order to live in semi-retirement. For reasons allegedly relating to financial necessity, he sold his magic library and apparatus for &pound;25. Despite his physical decline, which led eventually to the loss of his eyesight, he wrote <span class="italic">Latest Magic</span> (1919), reportedly at Robert-Houdin's urging. On 23 December, in the year of this book's publication, Lewis died at the age of eighty at his home, Manningford, Upper Bolebrooke Road, Bexhill. The funeral service and cremation were held at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 29 December 1919, and his ashes were interred at Highgate cemetery.<br>
