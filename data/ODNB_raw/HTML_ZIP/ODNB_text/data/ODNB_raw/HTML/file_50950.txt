<span class="headword">Carr,  Barbara Irene Veronica  Comyns</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Barbara Irene Veronica Bayley; <em>pseud. </em>Barbara Comyns]</span>  (1907&#150;1992), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 27 December 1907 at Bell Court, Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, the fourth among the six children (five girls and one boy) of Albert Edward Bayley (<i>d</i>. 1922), a Birmingham brewer and industrialist, and his wife, Margaret Eva Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fenn. Her childhood was described in her first book, <span class="italic">Sisters by a River</span> (1947), a memoir that evokes both the enchantment and the darker dimensions of her early family life. Having married at seventeen a much older and ostensibly a more wealthy man, Margaret Bayley lost her hearing in the trauma of her final confinement and remained deaf for the rest of her life. She communicated with her children through sign language and strange little notes left around the house, which suggest that her handicap exaggerated her wayward thinking. The marriage was turbulent, her husband drank too much, and, like so many at the time, the family declined from bourgeois security through poverty into debt. The tragic vulnerability of women, especially to the cruelty of men, later became a major theme in Barbara Comyns's work.<br>
<br>The Bayley girls were ineffectually educated by a succession of governesses. After the death of her father when she was fifteen, Barbara, intending to be a painter, attended art school, first in Stratford upon Avon. She then won a scholarship to the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London, a college which, unusually for the time, employed live models for life drawing. She found work in an animation studio drawing cartoons, and, inspired by the literature she had read in public libraries, also began to write, although she found her early work too derivative and destroyed it all when she married.<br>
<br>On 30 May 1931 she married John Francis Pemberton (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), a painter not destined for success. Barbara lost her job when she told her boss she was expecting a baby. Their son, Julian, was born in 1932, followed by a daughter, Caroline, in 1935. The couple's struggles later became the basis of her first novel, <span class="italic">Our Spoons Came from Woolworths</span> (1950). Over the next few years Barbara lived in London and supported her family in many ways: renovating pianos, trading antiques, working as a cook, dealing in classic cars, breeding poodle puppies, converting flats, and&#151;having considerable beauty&#151;modelling for artists and photographers. For a while during the Second World War, her marriage having broken down, she lived with Arthur Price, a benevolent and mildly disreputable character who later became the basis of her last novel, <span class="italic">Mr Fox</span> (1987). When the blitz came and a flying bomb landed in her Hampstead garden, Barbara left London with her family and took a job as a cook in a country house. It was there, living in a tied cottage, that she began to write notes of her own childhood to amuse her children.<br>
<br>Divorced from John Pemberton, Barbara married on 29 August 1945 Richard Strettel Comyns Carr (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), a Foreign Office official and the grandson of a prominent QC and playwright. Thinking that her full married surname of Comyns Carr was too long to appear on a book jacket, she chose to use Barbara Comyns as a shorter, more convenient pen-name. On their honeymoon in a cottage in Wales she began another novel, eventually published as <span class="italic">The Vet's Daughter</span> (1959), but put it aside in favour of a biography of the painter Leigh Hunt, which never found a publisher.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, at the encouragement of a friend, Comyns collected the fragments of the memoir of her childhood, which she had put away in a suitcase containing old photographs, and sent them to publishers. The honesty, even relish, with which she related a pre-war middle-class household, complete with cruelty, violence, drunkenness, and attempted murder, did not accord with the post-war craving for normality, so at first the proposed book met with no success. <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> magazine eventually serialized extracts under the title &#145;The Novel Nobody will Publish&#146;. These were read by the literary adviser to Eyre and Spottiswode, who subsequently published the whole text in 1947 under the title <span class="italic">Sisters by a River</span>. Although the family's descent from luxury to poverty provides a narrative thread, <span class="italic">Sisters by a River</span> is a collection of sketches rather than a novel. The mood meanders from pastoral beauty, nursery escapades, kittens, strawberries, new frocks, and childish treats to surreal terrors, macabre discoveries, violence, and cruelty. Fantasy interludes are given the weight of reality, as in a scene where a magic twig gives two five-year-olds the power of levitation. These random transitions, which occur often within a few sentences, convey vividly a world viewed with a child's understanding. Critics responded warmly to <span class="italic">Sisters by a River</span>, but Comyns was annoyed that, to enhance the childlike tone of the book, her publishers made a feature of her eccentric spelling. While her na&iuml;ve vision remained part of the charm of her writing, Comyns later ensured that her husband edited her work.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">Sisters by a River</span>, added to the happiness and security of the Comyns Carr marriage, encouraged a prolific period which first produced <span class="italic">Our Spoons Came from Woolworths</span>. This novel tells the tragic tale of Sophia and Charles, two young London bohemians whose marriage is too ephemeral to survive on love, art, and idealism alone. Although a more disciplined and mature work than Comyns's first book, it is as much autobiographical as fictional, with only a few wholly imaginary incidents, such as the Dickensian horror of the scene in which the rejected and feverish young wife collapses in a doorway with her child dying in her arms. Comyns found confidence to complete <span class="italic">The Vet's Daughter</span>, her most admired work of pure fiction. It was serialized by BBC Radio, adapted for the stage, and turned into a musical, <span class="italic">The Clapham Wonder</span>, by Sandy Wilson. London life in Edwardian Battersea, in a household losing its grip on middle-class values, is viewed through the eyes of the narrator, Alice. From childhood onwards her sadistic father and vulgar stepmother destroy her faint chances of happiness. In the final pages, impelled by sheer terror of her father, the young woman flies into the air above Clapham Common, drawing a large number of onlookers. When she falls to earth she and her malevolent stepmother are trampled to death in the crowd. Next Comyns wrote <span class="italic">Who was Changed and who was Dead</span> (1954), a novel inspired by newspaper reports of an epidemic of ergot poisoning in a French village. She relocated the story to the Warwickshire village of her childhood and imagined a macabre fantasy in which the river floods and the villagers are driven murderously insane.<br>
<br>Comyns had little time to enjoy the success of her work, however. Her husband's Whitehall superior, indeed the owner of their honeymoon cottage, was Kim Philby, now exposed as the mastermind of the Cambridge spy ring. Association with Philby ended Richard Comyns Carr's career and the family faced not only poverty but also scandal. They moved to Spain, where they lived for eighteen years, first in Barcelona and later in Andalucia. Their flight produced another memoir, <span class="italic">Out of the Red and into the Blue</span> (1960), which was followed by three more novels, <span class="italic">The Skin Chairs</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Birds in Tiny Cages</span> (1964), and <span class="italic">A Touch of Mistletoe</span> (1967), in which Barbara responded, perhaps unwisely, to her publisher's request for something &#145;less macabre&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>In the early 1980s, when the feminist imprint Virago republished Barbara's early work, the Comyns Carrs returned to England to live in the Richmond area, in homes where she always insisted on painting the ceiling of one room blue with white or gold stars. This move also inspired a renaissance in Comyns's writing, and she produced three more novels: <span class="italic">The Juniper Tree</span> (1985), <span class="italic">The House of Dolls</span> (1989), and finally <span class="italic">Mr Fox</span>.<br>
<br>After a short illness, Barbara Comyns died at 14 Stanton Cottages, Stanton upon Hine Heath, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 15 July 1992, and was buried at Stanton church. As a writer, her surreal imagination, elliptical style, and delicate lyricism foreshadowed the magic realist school and provide a record of bohemian life in London in the mid-twentieth century. In life, her unique charm, vivacity, and courage won her loyal friends but not the recognition of the literary establishment; she remains an unjustly neglected author.<br>
