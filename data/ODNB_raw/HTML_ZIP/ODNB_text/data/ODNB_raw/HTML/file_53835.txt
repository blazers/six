<span class="headword">Barry,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1810&#150;1857), <span class="occ">clown</span>, was born in Ireland about 1810. He was noted with Samwell's circus in Swansea in 1842, and as a white-faced ring clown at Astley's circus for long periods between 1843 and 1856. In 1844 he sailed the Thames from Vauxhall to Westminster in a tub drawn by four geese, an illusion originated by Dicky Usher in 1809. Celebrated as a clown and at the zenith of his fame in 1847, he was found by Sam Wild to be as jovial and good-natured as he had been when performing with Wild's travelling circus ten years earlier. In 1850 he was charged before the Lambeth police court with having assaulted William Henry Harvey, the ballet master at Astley's.<br>
<br>In 1849 Barry was with Hengler's circus at Windsor, and his benefit at the end of the nine-week season was very profitable. At Astley's during the 1850s he was paid &pound;10 per week. Perhaps his most famous turn was his comic imitation of a parliamentary candidate, with a speech from the hustings. A portrait shows that his make-up consisted of a white face, with small, delicately outlined red mouth, red triangles on his cheeks, greatly exaggerated black eyebrows, and a bald wig. He made guest appearances with other companies, being noted in 1853 at both Madame Macarte's circus in Wolverhampton and at E. T. Smith's Drury Lane circus in London. On one occasion, following a quarrel with the Shakespearian jester W. F. Wallett, he left Astley's in a huff to keep a public house: he was landlord of The Crown tavern, Lambeth, in 1848&#150;50 and again in 1856&#150;7. He finally left Astley's in 1856, when his right to choose his parts was withdrawn, but he died the following year, on 26 March, at Clapham, London. He was buried in Norwood cemetery. His widow, Elizabeth, an actress (formerly Mrs Hugh Campbell), lived until 1873, and his son, Tom Barry junior, followed his father's profession.<br>
