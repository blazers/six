<span class="headword">Osborn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Byng]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1693&#150;1775), <span class="occ">letter writer</span>, was born in October 1693 at Southill, Bedfordshire. She was the eldest and only surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4262/', "George Byng, first Viscount Torrington (1663&#150;1733)")</script>, the eminent naval officer, and his wife, Margaret (1670&#150;1756), daughter of James Master of East Langden, Kent. She had six surviving brothers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4263/', "Admiral John Byng (bap. 1704, d. 1757)")</script>. Presumably educated at home, Sarah was married in August 1710 to John Osborn (1683&#150;1719), eldest son of Sir John Osborn, bt, of Chicksands Priory, Bedfordshire, and his first wife, Elizabeth Strode. John Osborn died in January 1719, a few months before his thirty-sixth birthday, leaving his wife with two children: Danvers, born in 1715, and John, born in 1718. Three other sons and a daughter predeceased their father; the infant John died in the summer of 1719. Danvers became the third baronet on the death of his grandfather in April 1720.<br>
<br>Only a few months after her twenty-fifth birthday Sarah Osborn became the guardian of her son, with responsibility for maintaining his inheritance. The earliest of her published letters are primarily concerned with settling the estate and collecting all the rents and other income owed to her son. She depended on the help of her brother Robert (1703&#150;1740) in dealing with the lawyers and the courts, for &#145;When they see a man appear for one they will not delay so, but a poor woman is made nothing of&#151;she may live upon air seven year if she can&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sarah Byng Osborn</span>, 9). Nevertheless, hers was the guiding force in managing her son's inheritance and seeing to the upkeep of his houses and lands.<br>
<br>In 1740 Danvers Osborn married Lady Mary Montagu, fourth daughter of George, first earl of Halifax. She died in 1743 after the birth of her second son, John. Greatly distressed by his wife's death, Danvers withdrew from his family, travelling and serving with the Bedfordshire regiment during the Jacobite rising of 1745. He died in North America as governor of New York in 1753. Once again Sarah was left with small children to bring up and an estate to manage. Not only was she once again supervising the Osborn family interest, but as the senior surviving member of the Byng family, with her only brother an admiral often absent in the Mediterranean, she was concerned with that family as well. She played an active part in trying to secure mercy for her brother John Byng after he was sentenced to death on 22 January 1757 for failing to engage the French fleet at Minorca the previous year. Osborn, based not at Chicksands but at a town house in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, sought the help of John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, a member of the cabinet and the most powerful neighbour of the Byngs and the Osborns. In her letter she emphasized both the justice of her cause and her status as &#145;a distressed sister, surrounded only by weeping females, and helpless boys&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sarah Byng Osborn</span>, 85). This was followed by a cogently argued letter to the lords of the Admiralty questioning the procedure and principles under which Byng had been sentenced. Despite her efforts Byng was executed on 14 March; his last letter to Osborn, dated two days before his death, told her that &#145;All has proved fruitless, but nothing wanting in you that could be done&#146;  (ibid., 89). Osborn continued to maintain her connections with the duke of Bedford, and her letters to her younger grandson John, written while he was a fledgeling diplomat in Italy from 1766 to 1768, kept him informed of political issues and ministerial changes at home with the family's links to the Bedford whigs in mind. Her elder grandson Sir George Osborn, fourth baronet (1742&#150;1818), married in 1771; she welcomed the birth of his son John in 1773.<br>
<br>Sarah Osborn, born and married into families widely connected among the gentry and nobility of Bedfordshire and surrounding counties, lived a typical life for one of her time and class. She visited country houses, travelled on the continent, went to Bath, spent the season in London, attended court. Her family and friends were active in county politics. A number of family members held government appointments. However, she also had to assume responsibilities which few women would have expected to bear. Nearly forty years of her life were spent as guardian of her son and grandsons and in caring for the Osborn family inheritance. She learned to deal with lawyers, bankers, tenants, servants, and tradesmen. She carried on through family tragedies both great and small. She died in November 1775 and was buried on 22 November at Campton, Bedfordshire.<br>
<br>The challenges that Sarah Osborn faced are remembered because at least some of her letters survived and were published by a descendant in 1890 and republished with a new commentary in 1930. Although this collection contains only ninety-three letters and has doubtless been edited, it is sufficient to provide a picture of her life. The cost of housekeeping, the difficulties of renovation at Chicksands, and problems with livestock during her years of guardianship take up as much space as politics. Accounts of local elections and marriage arrangements, especially when these involved acquaintances, are frequently reported. Osborn's letters contain little about literature, art, or music. What has been published, however, is valuable for the reader who wants to know more about the life and responsibilities of aristocratic women in the eighteenth century. Osborn surely wrote many more letters than this small number, and it is to be hoped that more of her correspondence has survived. Perhaps other family members were not so ruthless as Osborn herself; she wrote to Danvers in 1739 that &#145;I have amused myself with cleaning away drawers full of old letters and papers, to save you the trouble of making a bonfire of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sarah Byng Osborn</span>, 43). This was, alas, often the fate of women's letters.<br>
