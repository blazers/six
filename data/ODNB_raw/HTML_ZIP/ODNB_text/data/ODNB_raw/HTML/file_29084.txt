<span class="headword">West,  Gilbert</span>  (1703&#150;1756), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the eldest son of Richard West DD (1671&#150;1716) and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1763), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27118/', "Sir Richard Temple (1634&#150;1697)")</script>, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27119/', "Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham")</script>. West's father was a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, from 1697 to 1708, prebendary of Winchester from 1706, and archdeacon of Berkshire from 1710 until his death on 2 December 1716. He published an edition of Pindar in 1697 and an edition of Theocritus in 1699. West's younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29098/', "Vice-Admiral Temple West")</script>. His sister Maria married Alexander Hood, later Viscount Bridport. The John West, scholar of Eton and King's College, Cambridge, who was born on 5 February 1713 and died of smallpox in Cambridge in 1732, may have been another brother.<br>
<br>West was educated at Eton College, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 16 March 1721, and graduated BA (1725). He served for some time in the army, and was afterwards employed under Lord Townshend (1674&#150;1738). About 1729 he married Catherine Bartlett (<i>d</i>. 1757), and retired to the village of West Wickham in Kent where he devoted himself, in Johnson's words, &#145;to learning and to piety&#146;. He had close family connections with George Lyttelton, first Baron Lyttelton (1709&#150;1773), and William Pitt, first earl of Chatham (1708&#150;1778), both of whom visited him frequently. One of the walks in West's garden was known as &#145;Pitt's walk&#146;. West was a correspondent of Philip Doddridge and a friend of Pope, who left him &pound;5 for a ring and a reversion of &pound;200 at the death of Martha Blount (who outlived West). Fifty-four letters are preserved in the Huntington Library, mostly to Elizabeth Montagu, also a family connection, who became a close friend in the last five years of his life. West had one son, Richard, who matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 20 November 1752 and died about December 1754.<br>
<br>West's first poem, addressed to Pope and published anonymously in 1732, described his uncle's gardens at Stowe. He published imitations of Spenser (<span class="italic">A Canto of the Fairy Queen</span> in 1739 and <span class="italic">Education: a Poem</span> in 1751), and <span class="italic">The Institution of the Order of the Garter: a Dramatick Poem</span> in 1742. Though apparently a doubter in earlier years, in 1747 he published <span class="italic">Observations on the History and Evidence of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ</span>, which earned him the Oxford degree of DCL (30 March 1748), and a reputation as &#145;the miracle of the moral world, a Christian poet&#146;  (Montagu, 1.278). By 1749 the work had gone through four editions and had been translated into French and German. Towards the end of his life he was engaged on a work to prove the authenticity of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. In 1749 West published his translation of a selection of the odes of Pindar, together with a dissertation on the Olympic games. While the translation itself is conventionally elegant, West's notes mark a breakthrough in the reading of the odes in terms of their historical occasion, and the dissertation, praised by Gibbon, offers a rare eighteenth-century appreciation of the cultural and political significance of sport. West's miscellaneous poetry and his translations were included in Johnson's collection.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1736 West was granted an annual pension of &pound;250, and in 1752 he was given a clerkship of the privy council. On 16 April 1754 he was made paymaster to Chelsea Hospital. He suffered severely from gout (and translated Lucian's &#145;The triumphs of the gout&#146;). West died of &#145;a stroke of the palsy&#146; in Chelsea on 26 March 1756 and was buried in West Wickham. His widow was allowed a pension of &pound;200 a year from 5 July 1756; she died in 1757. A memorial tablet to West and other members of the family was placed in St John's Church, West Wickham, by his brother's grandson, Admiral Sir John West, in 1846.<br>
