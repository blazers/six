<span class="headword">Kilner,  Dorothy</span>  (1755&#150;1836), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 17 February 1755, probably at Woodford, Essex, the youngest among the five children of Thomas Kilner (1719&#150;1804), public servant and landowner, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ayscough (1718&#150;1768). Thomas moved in 1759 to Maryland Point, then a rural Essex hamlet, now in London.<br>
<br>On the death of Frances Kilner, Dorothy's sister Eliza (1747&#150;1817) became her &#145;Mother, Sister, friend&#146;  (private information). Dorothy &#145;possessed unusual strength of mind and much originality of character&#146;  (ibid.). By the 1770s Dorothy was exchanging verse epistles on religious, moral, and personal subjects with her childhood friend Mary Ann Maze [<a name="cosubject_66297"></a><span class="headword">Mary Ann Kilner</span>  (1753&#150;1831)<span class="occ"></span>], who was born on 14 December 1753 at Spittal Square, London, the youngest of the three children of James Maze (<i>d</i>. 1794), a Huguenot immigrant and prosperous silk throwster and trader, and his wife, Marianne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Burmann (<i>d</i>. in or before 1774). The bilingual Mary Ann was &#145;highly intellectual, [with] a fertile imagination and a feeling heart&#146;  (ibid.). The Maze family lived near the Kilners and shared their cultivated tastes. Mary Ann and Dorothy learned, played, and wrote together. They used the personae of Dorinda and Anna and kept up a verse-epistle soap opera about the lives and matrimonial problems of an imaginary titled family. On 18 September 1774 Dorothy's favourite brother, Thomas (1750&#150;1812), married Mary Ann. Their move to Tom's home and silk-throwing business at 33 Spittal Square affected Dorothy's spirits profoundly. Her struggles (expressed in verse) to cultivate Christian contentment were rewarded with the birth in 1775 of Mary Ann's and Tom's daughter Mary Ann. Four more children followed, of whom Eliza (<i>b</i>. 1776) and Frances (<i>b</i>. 1783) survived. Thus began Dorothy's career as &#145;Aunt Do&#146; and as a writer.<br>
<br>Dorothy shared the objections of other contemporary women writers to fantasy and to romances of gallantry, love, and marriage&#151;a state she could afford to forgo from choice, preferring &#145;darling liberty&#146;. She never married. However, it was as a devoted aunt that she began writing herself and, under an alias, she sought advice about publication from the educationist Sarah Trimmer, who recommended her to the publisher John Marshall, later a family friend. In the decade from 1779 Dorothy produced over a dozen works, published at first anonymously, then as M. P. (Maryland Point), and finally as Mary Pelham. Her <span class="italic">Dialogues and Letters on Morality, Economy and Politeness</span> (1783?) and <span class="italic">Dialogues on the first principles of religion</span> (<i>c</i>.1787) were didactic and pious works for children. Her <span class="italic">Little Stories for Little Folks</span>, aimed at the very young, had short episodes and short words.<br>
<br>Mary Ann had by this time produced some half-dozen books, also published by Marshall, under the initials S. S. (Spittal Square). In <span class="italic">The Adventures of a Pincushion</span> (<i>c</i>.1780), a pincushion made by two girls, Martha and Charlotte Airy, is accidentally taken by a visitor. It is variously kept and lost by a number of characters, and its &#145;adventures&#146; highlight the different virtues and vices of those with whom it comes in contact. Mary Ann wanted her readers to &#145;avoid the failings, and practise those virtues or accomplishments, which render the contrary examples more worthy of imitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Adventures of a Pincushion</span>, 13).<br>
<br>Mary Ann's talking pincushion may have influenced Dorothy's best-known book, <span class="italic">Life and Perambulation of a Mouse</span> (<i>c</i>.1790), in which a visitor to a country house, charged with providing an original story for a winter gathering, relates the life story of a mouse called Nimble. It was the first children's book to give its animal characters distinct personalities, but Dorothy made a rational disclaimer for her talking mouse in a prefix to her tale: &#145;I must beg leave to assure my readers, that, in <i>earnest</i>, I never heard a Mouse speak in all my life; and only wrote the following narrative as being far more entertaining, and not less instructive than my own life would have been&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Perambulation of a Mouse</span>, xii). Dorothy's other books included <span class="italic">The Rochfords, or, The Friendly Counsellor</span> (<i>c</i>.1800), <span class="italic">The village school, or, A collection of entertaining histories for the instruction and amusement of all good children</span> (<i>c</i>.1795), <span class="italic">First Going to School, or, The Story of Tom Brown, and his Sisters</span> (1806), and <span class="italic">Edward the Orphan</span> (1824). All took the opportunity to show the rewards of goodness and honesty and the punishments of selfishness and misconduct. Mary Ann's books, such as <span class="italic">Jemima Placid, or, The Advantages of a Good-Nature</span> (<i>c</i>.1783), <span class="italic">William Sedley, or, The Evil Day Deferred</span> (<i>c</i>.1783), <span class="italic">The Happy Family, or, Memoirs of Mr and Mrs Norton</span> (<i>c</i>.1790), did likewise. <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Peg-Top</span> (<i>c</i>.1794) was written &#145;to promote the cause of virtue &hellip; with incidents of an amusing nature&#146;  (p. vi).<br>
<br>A decline in the silk trade due to a fashion-switch to muslins, plus his wife's ill health, led Tom to sell his business in 1787 and to live off his properties. The family took lodgings at Margate, where the girls attended a day school. About 1789, &#145;at his father's earnest desire&#146;  (private information), Tom and his family moved back to share the Maryland Point house with his father and sisters. A son, George, who was somewhat indulged, was born in 1791. From then on Mary Ann Kilner's life was overshadowed by bereavements and ill health. Her father James Maze died in 1794; her devoted brother James (Gig; he called her Pig) died in 1804, as did Thomas Kilner, Dorothy's father. The year 1812 saw the death of Mary Ann's husband and the birth of her first grandchild, Maria, to young George Kilner, who had set up as a miller in Suffolk where his father had property, and married Maria Garrett of Woodbridge in 1811, before he could afford to support a family. He received financial help from his relatives (notably Dorothy) after he suffered a breakdown in physical health. Mary Ann's eldest child, also Mary Ann, died while visiting George in 1816. In 1817 a fall and resulting back injury made her a chronic invalid, and she was nursed by her daughter Frances. Mary Ann Kilner died on 1 December 1831 and was buried on 8 December at All Saints', West Ham, Essex.<br>
<br>After the death of her sister Eliza in 1817, Dorothy's mind became impaired in her last years. Her eccentricities and trenchant outspokenness intimidated even her beloved nephew George. Devotedly nursed by her niece Frances and great-niece Maria, she died on 5 February 1836 and was buried at All Saints', West Ham.<br>
<br>Years later a trunk was found in the loft at Maryland Point. Left there by Dorothy and Mary Ann and labelled &#145;For Posterity&#146;, it contained copies of their books, which had been in print over forty years, some published in Ireland and the USA. The name Pelham was appropriated by other writers, notably the flamboyant Richard Phillips, and Beatrix Potter may have derived inspiration from <span class="italic">Life and Perambulation of a Mouse</span> through Charlotte M. Yonge's <span class="italic">A Storehouse of Stories</span>, in which Dorothy Kilner's tale was reprinted in 1870. The books, prized by collectors for their attractive bindings and illustrations rather than by juvenile readers, still offer, among the exhortations, sympathetic descriptions of children's behaviour and feelings, and lively recreations of their preferred toys and occupations&#151;and not always those approved by their elders.<br>
