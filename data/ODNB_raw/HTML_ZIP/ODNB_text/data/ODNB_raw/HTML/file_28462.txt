<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walford,  Edward</span>  (1823&#150;1897), <span class="occ">writer and compiler of reference works</span>, was born on 3 February 1823 at Hatfield Place, near Chelmsford, Essex, the eldest son of William Walford (<i>d</i>. 1855) of Hatfield Peverel, rector of St Runwald's, Colchester, and his second wife, Mary Ann, daughter of Henry Hutton, rector of Beaumont, Essex, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21899/', "Sir William Pepperrell")</script>. He was educated at Hackney Church of England school and Charterhouse School where, in 1840&#150;41, he won a Latin hexameter gold medal. He gained an open scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1841 and in 1843 won the chancellor's prize for Latin verse. He graduated BA (third class) in 1845 and MA two years later. At Balliol with Matthew Arnold, Walford was made deacon in 1847 and ordained priest by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce in 1848, gaining the Denyer theological prize in both years.<br>
<br>Walford spent a year as assistant master at Tonbridge School, then moved to Clifton, near Bristol, and London, preparing private pupils for Oxford, publishing Latin and Greek grammars, and writing theological books. In Clifton, on 8 August 1847, he married Mary Holmes Gray (1824/5&#150;1851). A daughter, Mary Louisa (later Mrs Colin Campbell Wyllie), was born in 1848. Walford had joined the Roman Catholic communion as a lay member by 1852, and married Julia Mary Christina Talbot (1822&#150;1895), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26934/', "Admiral Sir John Talbot")</script>, on 3 February 1852. The eight years from 1853 saw the birth of their children; Julia Marion (later Mrs Philip Conron), Edith (later Mrs Frederick Waddy), and Ethel were born in Clifton, and Alice (1857&#150;1870) was born in Westminster, and Edward and Philip in Hampstead.<br>
<br>In 1855 Walford had started his long career in biographic journalism when he compiled the first editions of the annuals <span class="italic">Hardwicke's Shilling Baronetage and Knightage</span>, <span class="italic">Hardwicke's Shilling Peerage</span>, <span class="italic">Hardwicke's Shilling House of Commons</span>, and <span class="italic">Hardwicke's titles of courtesy containing an alphabetical list of all those members of titled families whose names do not fall within the scope of peerage, baronetage or knightage</span>. Taken as a whole this series detailed the &#145;top ten thousand&#146; of Victorian society. In 1860 he compiled the first edition of his comprehensive <span class="italic">County Families of Great Britain</span> which was published annually for sixty years. In 1860 the Walford family moved into a substantial Georgian house at 17 Church Row, Hampstead, from where, for some twenty-six years, Edward wrote, edited, and compiled his biographical, topographical, and antiquarian books and his articles for a range of magazines and newspapers.<br>
<br>In 1858 Walford started contributing to Charles Knight's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>, but his forte was producing biographies at short notice, his 192-page biography of the prince consort arriving on the streets within twenty-two days of Albert's death in 1862. He produced similar biographies of others including Palmerston, Louis Napoleon, and Disraeli. Moving into periodical journalism, Walford became sub-editor and then editor of <span class="italic">Once a Week</span> (1859&#150;65). He edited the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1866 and strongly objected to the proprietor Joseph Hatton's decision to change the character of that magazine. Walford resigned and started his own <span class="italic">Register and Magazine of Biography</span>, but this failed within a year. Writing as Londoniana he then concentrated on topographic articles for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and leading periodicals. In 1874&#150;6 Walford edited Charles Knight's six-volume <span class="italic">London</span>, so he was the natural choice of the publisher Cassell &amp; Co. when Walter Thornbury, the author of its <span class="italic">Old and New London</span>, died in 1876 having written only the first two volumes. Walford completed the final four volumes of what became the standard popular work describing the history and growth of the metropolis. Originally published in monthly parts in 1873&#150;8, this lavishly illustrated series was frequently updated and reissued, as was Walford's equally successful two-volume <span class="italic">Greater London</span> (1882&#150;3). A 1968 overview of publications on London noted: &#145;for light bedside reading these books are admirable; they were obviously produced for the beginner who did not want his text cluttered with learned references&#146;  (Rubinstein, 124). But their popularity continues, and both series remain available in London reference libraries.<br>
<br>Within months of moving to Hampstead, Walford returned to the Church of England, but in 1870 he reverted to the Roman Catholic faith, resigning his holy orders in 1886. In the 1880s Walford edited the new journal <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>, but he was soon engaged in another acrimonious dispute with his proprietor, Elliot Stock, over the latter's treatment of him, and both protagonists published their case in the dispute. Walford retired from his journalistic duties in 1886 although he continued writing legal obituaries for <span class="italic">The Times</span> until 1891 and contributed to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> until the month of his death. Walford retired to Ventnor, Isle of Wight, in 1891, was awarded a civil-list pension for his literary work in 1892, then continued his literary output by compiling the eight-volume <span class="italic">Windsor Peerage</span> (1890&#150;97). In his <span class="italic">&#145;Patient Griselda&#146; and other Poems</span> (1894), which contains a good likeness of himself, Walford included acerbic verses satirizing his former proprietor Elliot Stock and calling him Ellicott Skinflint. A journalist contemporary of Walford's annotated his copy of <span class="italic">Patient Griselda</span> by assessing his former Hampstead neighbour as &#145;part author of <span class="italic">Old and New London</span> &hellip; a very cantankerous sort of man, always quarrelling&#146;  (Woolven, 25).<br>
<br>After years of illness and at the age of seventy-four, Walford died of a stroke in Ventnor on 20 November 1897. He was buried at Holy Trinity, Ventnor, on 24 November. Although it was reported that he had finally returned to the Church of England, his grave is in the Catholic area of the churchyard. He was a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute and of the Genealogical Society, and was a council member of the Society for Preserving the Memorials of the Dead. The British Library catalogue lists some eighty-seven books written, compiled, or edited by the industrious Edward Walford.<br>
