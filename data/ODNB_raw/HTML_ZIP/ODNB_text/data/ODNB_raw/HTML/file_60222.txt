<span class="headword">Pears,  Andrew</span>  (1846&#150;1909), <span class="occ">soapmaker and perfumer</span>, was born on 21 January 1846 at 55 Wells Street, near Oxford Street, London, one of several children of Francis Pears, soapmaker, and his wife, Mary Williams. He was the great-grandson of <a name="cosubject_60222"></a><span class="headword">Andrew Pears</span>  (1766/7&#150;1845), also a <span class="occ">soapmaker and perfumer</span>, who developed a soap formula in which ordinary soap was dissolved in alcohol, distilled, and shaped into individual bars. Born in Cornwall, Andrew Pears senior was apprenticed to a barber and went to London to establish his own barber's shop in Gerrard Street. It was there that he began making and selling his unique transparent soap in 1789. The popularity of the soap&#151;and the eagerness with which enterprising competitors produced imitation soaps&#151;led Pears to sign the wrapper of each bar as proof of its quality. In 1835 he established a partnership with his grandson Francis, centred on his unique formula, and founded the family business as A. and F. Pears. Andrew Pears senior resigned in 1838 and died on 24 April 1845 at his home, 55 Wells Street, London.<br>
<br>Andrew Pears junior was privately educated before being apprenticed to the family business. In 1862 at the age of sixteen he entered the soapworks at Isleworth, Middlesex, then newly built by his father, Francis. While still in his teens, Pears was placed in charge of the soapworks, retaining this responsibility throughout his forty-odd years with the firm. In 1865 Pears joined his father as a partner in the firm along with Thomas James Barratt, who had recently married Pears's oldest sister. Placed in charge of the London shop in Great Russell Street, Barratt began an ambitious programme of expansion which included increasing amounts of advertising. It was Barratt who paid &pound;2000 for Sir John Millais's painting <span class="italic">Bubbles</span>, and turned it into one of the most famous brand advertisements of all time.<br>
<br>Francis Pears retired in the mid-1870s, perhaps out of a reluctance to participate in the firm's increased use of advertising, leaving the firm in the hands of his son and son-in-law. With Andrew Pears to direct the soapworks and Barratt in charge of sales, A. and F. Pears continued to expand, even briefly considering establishing a soapworks in America. Barratt's daring and innovation in advertising Pears soap outraged and delighted the British public by turns, making Pears a household name. Profit grew apace with advertising expenditure and in 1892 the firm went public with Pears as director and Barratt as chairman. During Pears's years of stewardship the firm expanded production and achieved a steady increase in sales, and Pears Soap became one of the first British soaps to reach a national and international market, and one of the most recognized products of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1869 Pears married Mary Ann Pearson, daughter of Edward Hollingham, confectioner; they had six sons and three daughters. Pears typified the successful industrialist of the day: a sportsman, active in public service, he still saw to the day-to-day running of the soapworks. He served as justice of the peace for Middlesex and as an alderman, and was an active member of the local Liberal Party. He was known and much loved for his charity and concern for his workers. Shortly before his death he donated several acres of ground to be used for playing fields.<br>
<br>Pears died on 10 February 1909 at Mevagissey, his home in St John's Road, Isleworth, and was buried at Isleworth cemetery three days later. He was survived by his wife. His place on the board was taken by Joseph Beecham, of Beecham's Pills, and Barratt continued to serve as chairman. With Pears's death A. and F. Pears ceased to be a family concern. His oldest surviving son, Thomas Pears, was rejected by Thomas Barratt at the annual meeting of the board in the spring of 1909, when <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that &#145;The name Pears has nothing to do with father or son&#146;  (4 May 1909). In 1912 Tom Pears died in the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, and in 1914 A. and F. Pears was bought by its most important competitor, Lever Brothers.<br>
