<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rayne,  Max</span>, Baron Rayne  (1918&#150;2003), <span class="occ">property developer and philanthropist</span>, was born Max Rubenstein on 8 February 1918, at 102 City Road, St Lukes, Holborn, London, the son of Phillip Rubenstein (1894&#150;1979), who later took the surname of Rayne, a mantle manufacturer in Half Moon Passage, Aldgate, afterwards of St John's Wood, and his wife, Deborah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rack (1893&#150;1985). At the time of his birth his parents, who were Jewish, were living at 13 Bromehead Street, Stepney. He was educated at the Central Foundation School, Bow. While working for his father he took evening classes in law at University College, London. After the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the RAF, in which he rose to the rank of corporal. On 30 November 1941 he married Margaret Marco (<i>b</i>. 1920), twin daughter of Louis Marco, of Hendon, property developer. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1947 Rayne and his father leased a dress showroom in Wigmore Street at &pound;500 a year. Rayne soon discovered that he could sub-let the premises at a profit of over &pound;3000, and began dealing in property. He carried out some small deals involving Mayfair properties in Mount Street, Bruton Street, and Foley Street, which provided him with increasing capital. Next he bought the lease of the last private house in Berkeley Square for &pound;16,000 and resold it with planning permission for conversion for twice as much. He formed the British Commercial Property Investment Trust, which controlled such subsidiaries as Kensington Commercial Property Investments and West London Commercial Property Investments, and took a leading part in providing central London with modern office blocks. Bomb-sites left by the blitz were developed; and dismal, neglected buildings with peeling stucco or grimy bricks were demolished. Rayne's developments (often designed by the architect Cecil Elsom) helped to change the appearance of the capital.<br>
<br>A crucial phase of Rayne's career began in 1957. In that year he merged his property interests into London Merchant Securities, of which he became chairman and chief executive (1960&#150;2000), and subsequently life president. It was also in 1957 that he began developing a large site in Wigmore Street, behind Selfridge's, with a ten-storey office block which was subsequently occupied by IBM. This project required great determination and acumen to bring to fruition. In this period, too, Rayne became the first developer to work in partnership with the church commissioners. Their earliest collaboration was in the demolition of the Victorian houses in Eastbourne Terrace, opposite Paddington Station, which were notoriously occupied by prostitutes, and the erection of a fourteen-storey tower between several six-storey office blocks (1958&#150;62).<br>
<br>Rayne did good business with the Portman estate, which owned valuable streets and squares north of Oxford Street, and formed a joint development company with Lord Portman. He acquired the interests of the New York developer William Zeckendorf in the Savoy Plaza Hotel, which developed into the General Motors Building. He was also interested in British Lion Films (of which he was deputy chairman, 1967&#150;72), the British Printing Corporation, and (until 1977) the creation of Invergordon whisky distilleries. He backed Lord Delfont in the formation of the entertainment group First Leisure in 1984, and served as its chairman in 1992&#150;5.<br>
<br>With the fortune acquired from London Merchant Securities, Rayne in 1962 established the Max Rayne Foundation, which soon became a major force in charitable donations to the arts, education, and medicine. After the Darwin family vacated Newnham Grange in Cambridge, the Max Rayne Foundation provided a large endowment to establish a graduate college on the site, and Rayne himself made a large personal donation (1963&#150;4). The college was named Darwin, but its coat of arms&#151;granted in 1966&#151;joined the coats of Darwin and Rayne by impalement. In 1966 Rayne was elected as an honorary fellow both of Darwin and of University College, London, where his foundation had provided student accommodation and a new law faculty. Other major benefactions went to St Thomas's Hospital, of which Rayne became a governor in 1962 and a special trustee of the endowment funds in 1974. He sat on the council of King Edward VII's Hospital Fund for London, supported the burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, and funded the Rayne Laboratory in Edinburgh and a new department of immunology at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. He was vice-president of Jewish Care from 1966.<br>
<br>Rayne had an undying commitment to the arts, and proved shrewd, painstaking, and beneficent in solving the organizational and financial problems of many good causes. As chairman of the London Festival Ballet from 1967 to 1975 he put that organization on a sound footing. He was an assiduous governor (1966&#150;87) and president from 1987 of the Yehudi Menuhin School, and a trustee of the Henry Moore Foundation. His foundation was the lead donor in the London Library appeal of 1971&#150;2 (Rayne was a vice-president of the library until his death), supported the Royal Ballet School and the National Gallery, and provided &pound;250,000 to establish the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden in 1983. But Rayne's most patient and constructive work was for the National Theatre. In 1971 Lord Goodman induced him to succeed Lord Chandos as chairman of the National Theatre board. Remaining in this post until 1988, he oversaw the long-delayed move to the South Bank in 1976, and survived many exasperating incidents and tedious imbroglios. He impressed Lawrence Olivier as &#145;nice, quiet, simple and reasonable&#146;  (Olivier, 240); struck Peter Hall as a &#145;driven&#146; man, &#145;anxious and suspicious&#146;, but with &#145;brilliant foresight&#146;  (Hall, 269); and to Richard Eyre he was &#145;a very engaging (and generous) man who seems &hellip; vulnerable and almost childlike&#146;  (Eyre, 21).<br>
<br>Rayne's first marriage having been dissolved in 1960, he married, on 2 June 1965, Lady Jane Antonia Frances Vane-Tempest-Stewart (<i>b</i>. 1932), daughter of Edward Charles Stewart Robert Vane-Tempest-Stewart, eighth marquess of Londonderry. They had two sons and two daughters. Rayne was knighted in 1969, and received a life peerage, as Baron Rayne, of Prince's Meadow, in 1976.<br>
<br>A tactful but firm negotiator, Rayne seized on the essentials when taking a decision and always took the long view. He disliked diffuse thinking or unnecessary detail at meetings. A discriminating art-collector, he combined an impeccably neat appearance with modest, direct manners. Soft-voiced and courteous, he shunned publicity and prized his integrity: accordingly he was distressed when his much deserved peerage was gazetted in the Wilson resignation honours list, which included the names of less salubrious capitalists. He died of pneumonia and chronic aspiration on 10 October 2003, at 27 Circus Road, St John's Wood, and was cremated at Golders Green. He left an estate valued for probate purposes at just under &pound;120 million. He was survived by his wife, Jane, and his seven children.<br>
