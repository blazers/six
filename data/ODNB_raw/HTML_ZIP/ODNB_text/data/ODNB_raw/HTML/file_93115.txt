<span class="headword">Dudgeon,  Antony Greville <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born in a lunatic asylum&#151;a fact of which he was always proud&#151;at Khanka, twenty miles north of Cairo, on 6 February 1916, the younger son and youngest of three children of Herbert William Dudgeon (1873&#150;1935), head of the mental health organization for Egypt and Palestine, and his wife, Jessie Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer (<i>b</i>. 1873), from a banking family. He was educated at Eton College (1929&#150;33), then won a fee-paying scholarship to the Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, in January 1934. He graduated in December 1935, having been awarded the prestigious Groves prize as the year's best cadet pilot.<br>
<br>Dudgeon's first posting was to 11 squadron, equipped with single-engined Hawker Hart biplanes (later with twin-engined Bristol Blenheim bombers), at Risalpur on India's north-west frontier. After four years in India he was recalled to England, but when his ship reached Egypt in June 1940 he was required to join 45 squadron as a flight commander, and in October he took command of 55 squadron (both flying Blenheims). From a base west of Alexandria he led his squadron in many attacks on Italian targets in Libya. He was awarded a DFC in February 1941.<br>
<br>Posted in April 1941 to 4 flying training school at Habbaniyyah in Iraq, fifty miles west of Baghdad, for a rest, Dudgeon suddenly found himself back at war. A rising began in Iraq on 3 April under Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, the spokesman of a pro-Nazi junta, and Habbaniyyah&#151;a key training base and staging post between Egypt and India&#151;was soon surrounded. For once the British reacted swiftly: troops marched from Palestine and air reinforcements came from Basrah, but for four critical weeks Habbaniyyah depended on a flying training school equipped with obsolete aircraft, non-operational instructors, and pupil pilots. Inspired by Dudgeon (one of the few men with recent combat experience), they improvised a bomber and fighter force and (despite severe losses both of pilots and of aircraft) drove away their besiegers. Later, in 1942, Sir Arthur Tedder (head of British air forces in the Middle East) told Dudgeon that if the school had surrendered,<blockquote>the Germans would have got a foothold in Iraq. If they had then created a bridgehead behind us, through Vichy-controlled Syria from Greece, our Middle East base could have been nipped out with German forces both to its east and west. We might then have lost the war. (Orange, 132)</blockquote>Dudgeon was promoted to wing commander in March 1942 and sent to the headquarters of 216 group in Cairo&#151;delaying his arrival in order to marry Phyllis Margaret (Phyl) McFarlane (<i>c</i>.1922&#150;1994), daughter of his commanding officer in India, John McFarlane, in All Saints' Cathedral, Cairo, on 5 May 1942. From Egypt he patrolled the route along which numerous aircraft were flown from Takoradi in the Gold Coast to Cairo via several staging posts, a distance of 4000 miles. He was an exceptional pilot and would fly anything in any kind of weather. In July 1943 he returned to England, defying regulations (as he often did) by taking his heavily pregnant wife with him. They eventually had two children, Michael (<i>b</i>. 1943) and Jacqueline (<i>b</i>. 1946). He joined Transport Command and played a part in planning and executing operations on the continent in 1944&#150;5.<br>
<br>After a staff college course in 1946 Dudgeon spent three years conducting transport operations during the Malayan emergency. He served briefly in the Air Ministry until July 1952 when he took command of RAF Benson, south of Oxford. Now a group captain and known to have a practical, no-nonsense, good-humoured approach to all problems, he was invited to review the terms and conditions of airmen's employment; his review resulted in several lasting reforms and earned him a CBE in 1955. From December of that year he commanded RAF Bruggen, on the Dutch&#150;German border, and got four squadrons of Hawker Hunter fighters ready for operations before a defence review in 1957 suddenly disbanded them. On promotion to air commodore in January 1962, he was put in charge of air cadets, then made director of flight safety, and finally (as an air vice-marshal) acted as chief of staff to the British defence staff in Washington.<br>
<br>Dudgeon retired from the RAF in April 1968 and spent the next ten years as head of the Paris office of McKinsey &amp; Co., management consultants. He was then representative in France of Grangersol Ltd (1978&#150;81), before returning to England. As well as regular contributions to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span>, he published three books: <span class="italic">The Luck of the Devil</span> (1985, revised as <span class="italic">Delightful and Dangerous</span> in 2002), covering the years 1934&#150;41; <span class="italic">Wings Over North Africa</span> (1987, revised as <span class="italic">A North African Pilot</span> in 2002), about the years 1941&#150;3; and a detailed narrative of the Habbaniyyah campaign, <span class="italic">The War that Never Was</span> (1991, revised as <span class="italic">Hidden Victory</span> in 2000). He tried in vain to get a battle honour awarded to 4 flying training school for its gallant resistance to Iraqis and Germans in 1941, but Air Ministry bureaucrats insisted that a training school was not an operational unit, no matter how many operations it flew to help meet a crisis.<br>
<br>Tony Dudgeon was a liveryman of the Mercer's Company, and served on the committee of the RAF Benevolent Fund. He was an expert photographer and fluent in both Arabic and French. His wife, Phyllis, died in 1994 and a year later he moved to 155 Rivermead Court, Ranelagh Gardens, Fulham. He spent his last six years with Regine Oliver; his son, Michael, said that meeting Regine was &#145;a small miracle&#146;, bringing her and his father a &#145;marvellous companionship&#146;  (M. Dudgeon, memorial address). He died on 5 January 2004 at Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham, London, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his two children.<br>
