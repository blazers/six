<span class="headword">Thompson,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em> the Mouseman of Kilburn]</span>  (1876&#150;1955), <span class="occ">woodcarver</span>, was born on 7 May 1876 at Kilburn Hall, Kilburn, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the sixth son and seventh of the eight children of John Thompson (<i>c</i>.1832&#150;1895), village joiner, and his wife, Dinah (<i>c</i>.1838&#150;1898), daughter of Benjamin Cornforth. Robert attended the village school in Kilburn and was particularly competent in drawing. His elder brothers were engaged in joinery, farming, and stone masonry.<br>
<br>At the age of fourteen Thompson began a five-year apprenticeship in engineering with Garnett Wire Ltd in Cleckheaton. Being accustomed to a rural life he did not enjoy the industrial West Riding and travelled home when he could. During the journey he had to wait an hour in Ripon, where he spent his time in the cathedral sketching the medieval woodcarvings attributed to William Bromflet. He studied Tudor woodcarving tools, acquired&#151;or made&#151;his own tools, and started to practise carving with the help of one of his father's men. Thompson saw that the rippled surface produced by an adze on the surface of the oak&#151;a characteristic of his later work&#151;allowed the wood's colour, grain, and medullary rays to be displayed to their full beauty, thereby being in sympathy with the current arts and crafts movement.<br>
<br>On the completion of Thompson's apprenticeship his father agreed to take him on as his assistant. However, John Thompson died nine months later, leaving Robert to run the business. While running the joinery business with the help of his brothers he also managed to set time aside to study more deeply the carving of wood, particularly English oak (<i>quercus robur</i>). On 17 October 1905 he married Ada Jane (1867/8&#150;1943), daughter of James Newby, butcher, at Shipton Thorpe in the East Riding of Yorkshire; their only child, Elsie, was born a year later.<br>
<br>The conclusion of the South African War in 1902 brought an increased demand for memorial church furniture, which Thompson was now able to supply. Possibly his first order was for a pulpit for Yearsley church in the North Riding of Yorkshire in 1909. Orders for lychgates required that he work in two materials, and so, with the help of his brother, Thompson carved in stone and oak. In 1919 he was asked to create a large crucifix for the Roman Catholic church at Ampleforth, where he met Paul Neville. The two men were of similar age and formed a lasting friendship, meeting regularly to talk and to share food and a pipe. Neville later became headmaster of Ampleforth College and placed many further orders for the abbey and school, which now hold the largest collection of Thompson's work. Thompson was asked to create chairs for the monks and, knowing that the abbey's patron saint, St Lawrence, had been martyred on a hot gridiron, chose this emblem for the side and back panels of his &#145;monk's chair&#146;. The design was later modified to be less severe and became the lattice panel that is still used on many chairs.<br>
<br>Aware that the making of high-quality carved furniture required air-seasoned oak, Thompson slowly built up a large stock at his workshop at Kilburn. From about 1920 he began to incorporate a carving of a mouse on each of his pieces. The idea for the mouse&#151;which became his trademark, and led to him being known as the Mouseman of Kilburn and Mousey Thompson&#151;either followed his observation of a mouse quietly at work in a local church or was his response to another craftsman's claim that they were as poor as church mice. The latter explanation was offered by Thompson in a letter to a client  (J. Thompson, 20), though the mouse trademark also fits with his adopted motto: <i>Industry in quiet places</i>. From about 1920 a carving of a mouse usually appeared on work by Thompson's company. In this period his skills as local joiner led to his appointment as the area factor for the ecclesiastical commission which, from the dissolution of Byland Abbey until the 1950s, owned most of the properties and lands in the area surrounding Kilburn. Thompson's duties involved the regular inspection of properties and the organization of their maintenance. About the time that he introduced the mouse to his work Thompson was also active, with other local people, in restoring the Kilburn White Horse, a mid-nineteenth-century chalk figure on Roulston Scar. He was also prominent in the committee that raised funds for the figure's regular &#145;grooming&#146;.<br>
<br>The demand for ecclesiastical memorial pieces increased further during the inter-war period and the Kilburn workshop expanded from ten craftsmen in 1928 to thirty by the middle of the following decade. Many of Thompson's several hundred ecclesiastical commissions were for church interiors in Yorkshire and examples of his stalls, memorial screens, and doors, fonts, pulpits, altars, rails, lecterns, and chairs can be seen, for instance, at St Mary the Virgin, Bridlington, St Mary's, Beverley, St Michael's, Coxwold, and All Saints, Ilkley, as well as at York Minster, where some of his finest work was undertaken under the supervision of the architects Sir Charles Peers and Sir Albert Richardson. Other notable examples of church interiors include work at St Mary the Virgin, Berkeley, Gloucester, the Benedictine priory at Workington, Cumberland, St John the Baptist, Spalding, Lincolnshire, and St Edward's Roman Catholic Church on the Hebridean island of Canna. Though a self-styled &#145;ecclesiastical contractor&#146;, Thompson also undertook commissions for domestic interiors. One of his earliest pieces was an oak staircase at Upsall Castle, north of Kilburn, and one of his largest was a table for Ampleforth College library, for which he later designed carrels, bookcases, and chairs between the mid-1920s and 1950s. Thompson's domestic work also brought him to the attention of an overseas market: the first order from North America was placed in the 1920s, and subsequent requests indicated the growing popularity of both his work and trademark: one successfully delivered letter was addressed simply to &#145;The Mouseman, England&#146;.<br>
<br>During the Second World War many of Thompson's craftsmen were called up to fight; in 1944 he wrote that &#145;Orders are pouring in and I've only one man and six boys left out of thirty-three; I have work to do in seventeen churches&#146;  (family archives). In the early days most of the work had been done by hand, but Thompson saw the advantages of machine tools, as well as their faults. He allowed machines to take the hard grind out of the work, but insisted that his craftsmen impart the care, time, and skill to bring out the very best qualities of the wood. In keeping with this appreciation of his craft&#151;a feature throughout his working life&#151;Thompson collected examples of carvings and used them as a resource for himself and his apprentices. He also collected humorous and pithy sayings and mottoes for use on furniture, along with heraldic devices which feature in his work and about which he was deeply knowledgeable.<br>
<br>In 1924 Thompson's daughter, Elsie, married Percy Gregory Cartwright, one of Robert's craftsmen in Kilburn. Their sons, Robert Thompson Cartwright and John Cartwright, joined the family business and served an apprenticeship under their grandfather. Robert's great-grandsons continued in the family tradition, and in the early twenty-first century were responsible for running Robert Thompson Craftsmen's Ltd, still based at Kilburn. Robert Thompson died of cancer on 8 December 1955 at the Purey Cust Nursing Home, York, and was buried on 11 December at St Mary's, Kilburn. A quiet, hard working, well-read, humorous man, he passed on his skills and enthusiasm to numerous apprentices and directed his expanding firm for sixty years. Thompson's &#145;mouse furniture&#146; is now enjoyed worldwide.<br>
