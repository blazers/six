<span class="headword">Houthuesen,  Albert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Albertus Antonius Johannes Houthuesen]</span>  (1903&#150;1979), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 3 October 1903 in Albert Cuypstraat, Amsterdam, the eldest of the four children of Jean Charles Pierre Houthuesen (1878&#150;1911), a pianist and artist, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wedemeyer. Following the unexpected death of their father, in 1912 the Houthuesen children moved with their mother to London, settling at Constantine Road, Hampstead. Desperately poor, and unable to speak English, Houthuesen left school at the age of fourteen to work in a variety of menial jobs. He attended evening classes in art at St Martin's School of Art, and his spare time was spent drawing in the British Museum and the National Gallery. In 1922, aged nineteen, he became a British citizen, and in 1923 his paintings were recommended to William Rothenstein who offered him a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, of which he was the director. This began a lifelong friendship with the Rothenstein family, particularly with Sir John Rothenstein, who became Houthuesen's foremost supporter.<br>
<br>While studying at the Royal College from 1923 until 1927, Houthuesen met the painter Catherine Dean (<i>d</i>. 1983). They were married in 1931 and settled at 20 Abbey Gardens, moving in 1938 to a studio flat at 37B Greville Road, St John's Wood. The couple had no children. Unable to make a living through selling his own work, Houthuesen gave evening classes in painting. For three decades until 1961 he endured poverty and neglect, making a very occasional sale and receiving a few portrait commissions. His subjects included scenes of London life and sketches made on Hampstead Heath. He first visited Trelogan in north Wales in 1932, staying for a month in a cottage to which he and Catherine returned annually until 1940. Here he was greatly inspired by the people and landscape: his portraits and drawings of Welsh miners and farmers are among his finest work.<br>
<br>It was, however, as a painter of the sea that Houthuesen was later recognized, and his first interpretations of violent waves lashing against jagged rocks date from the 1930s, when he also visited the coasts of Sussex and Devon. Rejected by the army as medically unfit, he worked as a tracer in the technical drawing office of the London and North Eastern Railway Company in Doncaster, Yorkshire. During his absence from London over forty oil paintings stored in a neighbour's cellar were destroyed beyond repair by damp. The effect of this calamity, combined with the tedium of tracing engine designs for the railway company, led to a nervous breakdown. Houthuesen returned to London at the end of the war and met a family of Russian clowns who inspired him to work on a series of studies of clowns, a theme he continued to explore until his death. In 1952 he and Catherine settled permanently at 5 Love Walk, Camberwell, never leaving London again. His expressionist, sometimes violent, colourful paintings of the imagined sea dominated his prodigious artistic output, which remained unseen outside a small circle until 1961 when he had his first one-man exhibition, at the Reid Gallery, Cork Street, London. Houthuesen was fifty-nine years old, and although his work was virtually unknown to private collectors of art, three of his paintings, including <span class="italic">Crown of Thorns</span> (1939&#150;40), were by then in the collection of the Tate Gallery, London, two (<span class="italic">Grain Barrels</span> and <span class="italic">The Collier</span>) in the Sheffield City Art Galleries collection, and others in museums in Nottingham, Leeds, and Carlisle. During the 1960s a series of exhibitions in London brought him both critical acclaim and income through sales. His second exhibition at the Reid Gallery was in 1963; the Mercury Gallery then mounted five exhibitions between 1967 and 1977. Despite the recognition he received during his final decade, Houthuesen continued to be dogged by ill health, which at times made it impossible for him to paint. He died at his home in Camberwell on 20 October 1979.<br>
