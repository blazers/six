<span class="headword">Achurch,  Janet</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Janet Sharp]</span>  (1863&#150;1916), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at 47 Richmond Grove, Chorlton upon Medlock, Lancashire, on 17 January 1863, the third and youngest daughter (there was also a son) of William Prior Sharp, insurance agent, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson, who died in giving birth to her. Brought up by her widower father, she was educated privately. She was descended, she herself claimed, from a long line of actors, from whom her stage name, Achurch, was derived. Her great-grandparents Thomas Achurch Ward (1749&#150;1835) and Sarah Hoare (1756&#150;1838) had been managers of the Theatre Royal, Manchester, and friends of the Kemble family in the late eighteenth century and it was apparently assumed from the start that this striking-looking young woman would follow the family tradition. In 1881 she was sent to Sarah Thorne's actor-training school in Margate (where, a few years later, Harley Granville Barker received his first training for the stage). She made her first appearance on the stage in a farce called <span class="italic">Betsy Baker</span> at the Olympic Theatre, London, in January 1883. During the latter part of 1883 and in 1884 she toured the English provinces in a variety of plays, including C. H. Hazelwood's <span class="italic">Lady Audley's Secret</span> (dramatized from Mary Elizabeth Braddon's melodramatic novel) and <span class="italic">The New Magdalen</span> (Wilkie Collins). Of her performance in the latter, Bernard Shaw wrote in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> that it showed her to be &#145;the only tragic actress of genius we now possess&#146;  (Shaw, <span class="italic">Dramatic Opinions</span>, 221).<br>
<br>On 25 May 1884 Achurch married (Fitzwilliam) St Aubyn Miller (1865&#150;1929), an actor, the son of James Miller, army officer, but the marriage proved a disaster and they separated after only a few months. In 1885 she joined the Frank Benson company, contracted to play leading parts, on tour, in Bulwer Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>, Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">The Corsican Brothers</span>, and three Shakespeare parts&#151;Gertrude, Desdemona, and Lady Macbeth. She stayed with the company for only one season. Early in 1886 she began to live with Charles Martin (1854&#150;1926), known as Charles Charrington, an actor in the Benson company at that time. In December 1888 her husband petitioned for a divorce, which was granted on 18 June 1889. She married Charrington at Chelsea register office on 28 June 1889. During 1887 and 1888 she alternated between playing in London and touring nationally with various companies. Her London appearances included Lady Teazle with the Farren-Conway company at the Strand Theatre in July 1887 and a season with Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre in January 1888. In 1889, when she was still only twenty-three, she undertook the management of the Novelty Theatre, London, where on 7 June she appeared as Nora in the first English production of Ibsen's <span class="italic">A Doll's House</span>. This was a turning point both in her career and in English critical appreciation of Ibsen. Granville Barker thought it the most dramatic theatrical event of the decade. Charles Charrington, her husband, appeared with her in this production, playing the part of Dr Rank and, immediately after its limited run was over, on 5 July 1889 they left London for a two-year theatre tour of Australia, where their daughter Nora (1890&#150;1914) was born. The tour was successful and they extended it to include New Zealand, Tasmania, India, and Egypt. However, while in Cairo Janet Achurch almost lost her life in childbirth. The child was stillborn and, though she continued with her stage performances, she was able to do so only with increasingly large doses of morphia, which the doctor had prescribed. She already had a tendency towards alcoholism; to this was now added morphine addiction.<br>
<br>In spite of physical debility and depression, immediately on her return to London in 1892 Achurch plunged into a heavy and continuous programme of work. At the Avenue Theatre she repeated her success as Nora in a new production of <span class="italic">A Doll's House</span> and subsequently, during 1893 and 1894, was continuously engaged, although playing in several undistinguished pieces. In November 1896, in spite of being pregnant again, she undertook the challenging and exacting role of Rita in Ibsen's <span class="italic">Little Eyolf</span>. The cast of this production also included Mrs Patrick Campbell and Elizabeth Robins. Shaw praised her performance:<blockquote>She played with all her old originality and success, and with more than her old authority over her audience &hellip; For the first time one clearly saw the superfluity of power and the vehemence of intelligence which make her often so reckless as to the beauty of her methods of expression. (Shaw, <span class="italic">Dramatic Criticism</span>, 197)</blockquote>For just such qualities of the actor's craft Shaw, on another occasion, compared Janet Achurch&#151;and favourably&#151;with Eleonora Duse, whose work he much admired.<br>
<br>The following year Achurch played the lead in the first production of Shaw's <span class="italic">Candida</span>, the play that he had written in 1894 with her very much in mind and which he had in 1895 offered to the American actor Richard Mansfield, on condition that he cast Janet Achurch as the eponymous heroine. When Mansfield refused to do as he wished Shaw withdrew his offer of the play, which remained unperformed. Achurch finally played the part at Her Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen, on 30 July 1897 at the start of a provincial tour and, later, at the Strand Theatre, London, on 1 July 1900 under the auspices of the Stage Society. At the same theatre, and again for the Stage Society, on 16 December 1900 she played the leading role of Lady Cicely Waynflete in the first production of Shaw's <span class="italic">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</span>. About her performance in this Shaw, in a splendid letter to her, said: &#145;Lady Cicely is the first sign you have given of reaching the wise age of comedy and being able to play the fiddle as well as the trombones and drums&#146;  (Shaw, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.208).<br>
<br>Achurch appeared in Ibsen twice more before her career closed, though in both cases the play had been seen in England before: in 1902 in <span class="italic">The Lady from the Sea</span> and in 1911 in <span class="italic">A Doll's House</span> (in which she no longer played Nora but the lesser part of Mrs Linde). On 15 May 1903 she played the part of Leila Daintree in the first (and only) production of <span class="italic">Mrs Daintree's Daughter</span>, a piece which is interesting for its history and its associations rather than for any intrinsic merit. It was written by Janet Achurch herself in 1897&#150;8, based on Guy de Maupassant's novel <span class="italic">Yvette</span>, at the encouragement of Shaw. In 1912 she played Ann Redvers in Eden Phillpotts's <span class="italic">Secret Woman</span>.<br>
<br>Janet Achurch's last appearance on the London stage was in October 1913, as Merete Beyer in John Masefield's version of <span class="italic">The Witch</span>, a Norwegian play by Wiers-Jenssen; she had played the part two years before in an earlier production of the play. Exhausted and ill, she announced her official retirement immediately after the play closed. She died, aged fifty-two, at 4 Devonshire Terrace, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, on 11 September 1916. The cause of death was morphine poisoning. She was survived by her husband, Charles Charrington, who died in 1926.<br>
