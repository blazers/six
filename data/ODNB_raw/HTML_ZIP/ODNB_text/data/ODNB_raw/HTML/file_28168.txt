<span class="headword">Vedder,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1789, <em>d.</em> 1854), <span class="occ">poet</span>, son of a small landowner, was baptized on 29 December 1789 in the parish of Deerness, near Kirkwall, Orkney, the son of John Vedder and Jean Shewrie. His father died when he was young, and he was educated by his mother. She died when he was about twelve, and he went to sea as a cabin boy. Ten years later he became captain of a Greenland whaler, which he commanded for several years. In 1815 he was appointed first officer of an armed cruiser, and in 1820 became a tide surveyor, officiating successively at Montrose, Kirkcaldy, Dundee, and Leith.<br>
<br>Vedder wrote and translated verse from an early age, publishing his first poem in his early twenties. In 1828 he published <span class="italic">The Covenanters' Communion and other Poems</span>. In 1830, after a quarrel with Henry Glassington Bell, editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Literary Journal</span>, Vedder set up the rival <span class="italic">Edinburgh Literary Gazette</span>, which was supported by De Quincey among others. In 1832 he published <span class="italic">Orcadian Sketches</span>, a prose and verse miscellany, as well as a popular <span class="italic">Memoir of Sir Walter Scott</span>. In 1839 he edited <span class="italic">Poetical Remains of Robert Fraser</span>, a Kirkcaldy poet, together with a memoir. He contributed text for Walter Geikie's <span class="italic">Etchings</span> in 1841, and the following year he published <span class="italic">Poems, Legendary, Lyrical, and Descriptive</span>, illustrated by Geikie. Among these his lyric &#145;The Temple of Nature&#146; was a favourite with Thomas Chalmers, who often recited it to his students. The same year Vedder collaborated with Frederick Schenck in <span class="italic">The Pictorial Gift-Book of Lays and Lithographs</span>. In 1852 he published his <span class="italic">Story of Reynard the Fox</span>, with lithographs by Schenck and MacFarlane, considered on its appearance &#145;by far the best edition of this famous story yet presented in English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, 1852, 789). He was a contributor to many anthologies and magazines, including the supplementary volume of George Thomson's <span class="italic">Scottish Melodies</span>, Blackie's <span class="italic">Book of Scottish Song</span> (1844), <span class="italic">Whistle-Binkie</span> (1853), Constable's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Christian Herald</span>, <span class="italic">Tait's Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>. A posthumous volume of Vedder's <span class="italic">Poems, Lyrics, and Sketches</span> was published in 1878, with a memoir by George Gilfillan, who remembers him as &#145;tall, considerably above 6 feet, rotund, red faced, and with a world of sagacity in his rugged features, and of warmth in his big heart&#146;  (Gilfillan, xiv).<br>
<br>Retiring on a pension in 1852, Vedder died of kidney disease at 173 Causewayside, Newington, Edinburgh, on 11 February 1854, and was buried in the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his widow, a son in the Royal Navy, and two daughters, one of whom was married to Frederick Schenck, a well-known Edinburgh lithographer.<br>
