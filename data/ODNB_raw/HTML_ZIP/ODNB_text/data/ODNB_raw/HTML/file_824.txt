<span class="headword">Aston <span class="st"> [Ashton]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1407), <span class="occ">Lollard preacher</span>, was an early disciple of John Wyclif. A native of Worcester diocese, from 1365 to 1372 he was paid as a fellow of Merton College (which produced a large number of Wycliffites), and in 1372 was appointed a royal commissioner to settle a dispute at the university over the election of proctors. He gained the degrees of master of arts and scholar of theology. His career as a Wycliffite preacher had begun by 1382, if not earlier. The Leicester chronicler Henry Knighton describes Aston as a tireless preacher, trudging on foot from place to place, staff in hand, making converts of simple men by talking to them at table. Knighton reports under 1382 a sermon delivered by Aston in Leicester on an unspecified Palm Sunday, advocating the confiscation of clerical temporalities, condemning the begging of the friars and the excommunication of true preachers, and maintaining that the material substance of the bread remains in the sacrament of the altar after its consecration . However, another chronicler, Thomas Walsingham, attributes the same sermon to the Lollard William Swinderby.<br>
<br>In May 1382 Aston preached in Odiham church and elsewhere in Hampshire with two other disciples of Wyclif from Oxford&#151;Nicholas Hereford and Laurence Stephen (Laurence Bedeman). These three are named as Wyclif's most important supporters in the dubiously authentic &#145;confession&#146; of John Ball of 1381. Then on 12 June 1382, during the Council of Blackfriars which condemned Wyclif's teachings as erroneous, Aston's suspension from the university, together with that of Wyclif, Hereford, Stephen, and Philip Repyndon, was ordered by Archbishop Courtenay of Canterbury. Aston appeared before the council on 18 June, with Hereford and Repyndon, when all three were required to sign a condemnation of twenty-four errors of Wyclif.<br>
<br>Unlike Hereford and Repyndon, Aston refused to prepare a written defence of his views, and said that he would answer verbally forthwith. His answers were deemed unacceptable, however, as were those of his colleagues, and all three men were summoned to return on 20 June to give more appropriate replies. In the meantime they took the extraordinary step of publishing their views in English. Aston's views on the eucharist were considered particularly offensive, and his <span class="italic">Confessio</span>, addressing this question, written in both Latin and English, was distributed on handbills around London&#151;a tactic that the authorities countered with leaflets of their own. Back before the council on 20 June, Aston was defiant and, buoyed by a sympathetic crowd that had broken into the hall, gave impudent and evasive answers in English to the questions put to him, refusing to speak in Latin. Archbishop Courtenay declared him a heretic and handed him over to the secular arm, and on 13 July he was expelled from the university by royal mandate. In November, however, Aston abjured his heretical views during a convocation in Oxford, received absolution from the archbishop, and was reinstated at the university. He attributed his change of heart to the influence of his colleagues, most of whom had already submitted, and to that of Nicholas Radcliffe, abbot of St Albans.<br>
<br>Aston's recantation was brief, however, and by the following year he had resumed his heretical preaching, delivering a sermon at Gloucester, probably in February 1383, that criticized the impending Flemish crusade of Bishop Despenser of Norwich. In late 1386 he preached in London, again enjoying the support of its citizens, and in the summer of 1387 was one of five Wycliffites whose preaching at Bristol and elsewhere within the diocese of Worcester was forbidden by its bishop. In May 1388 royal commissions authorized the bishops of Worcester, Salisbury, and Hereford to search for, seize, and destroy all the heretical writings of Wyclif, Hereford, Aston, and John Purvey. Aston may have returned to his fellowship at Merton in 1391, for a fellow named Aston was paid in the bursar's account for the period from November 1391 to March 1392, but nothing else is known of him. He was dead by 7 August 1407, when the Lollard William Thorpe declared to Archbishop Arundel that Aston had taught and written his heretical views &#145;right perfectly unto his life's end&#146;  (Emden, <span class="italic">Oxf.</span>, 1.67).<br>
