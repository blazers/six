<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gifford <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Plunkett]</span>,  Grace Evelyn Mary Vandeleur</span>  (1888&#150;1955), <span class="occ">artist and Irish nationalist</span>, was born at 8 Temple Villas, Palmerston Road, Rathmines, Dublin, on 4 March 1888, one of the twelve children of Frederick Gifford (<i>d</i>. 1917), a solicitor, and his wife, Isabella Julia Burton (<i>d</i>. 1932). Like her sisters, Grace was raised in her mother's protestant faith, while her brothers followed their father's Catholicism. She was educated at Alexandra School and College, Dublin, and at the Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, where her talent as a caricaturist was fostered by William Orpen. In 1907 she studied at the Slade School of Art, London, returning to Dublin in 1908 to begin a precarious artistic career.<br>
<br>In Dublin, Grace Gifford lived with her staunchly unionist parents, yet this did not prevent her from engaging in social, cultural, and political activities which invited their disapproval. Together with her sisters Muriel and Sidney [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58614/', "Czira, Sidney")</script>], she attended meetings of the Gaelic League, the Irish Women's Franchise League, and Inghinidhe na hEireann (Daughters of Ireland). Her political sympathies were evident in the affectionate caricatures she contributed to nationalist journals. In 1912 Muriel Gifford married Thomas MacDonagh, one of the future leaders of the Easter rising, and it was through her brother-in-law that Grace met her future husband in late 1914. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62969/', "Joseph Mary Plunkett (1887&#150;1916)")</script> was a poet and editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span>, and his devout Catholicism was attractive to Gifford, who was questioning her own protestant faith. Their courtship flourished as Grace prepared to convert, although it was disrupted by Plunkett's tuberculosis and his trip to Germany in 1915 to seek military aid for a planned insurgency. In December 1915 Plunkett and Gifford announced their engagement, and on 7 April 1916, Gifford was received into the Catholic church. Their marriage was planned for the following Easter Sunday, 23 April 1916.<br>
<br>Gifford spent the next weeks unaware of the military plans her fianc&eacute; was making, but she helped him to decode a leaked document which apparently revealed imminent British plans to disarm the Irish Volunteers. This discovery helped to precipitate the rising, which broke out on Easter Monday. Plunkett, convalescent from throat surgery, helped to occupy the General Post Office, while Gifford waited anxiously with her sister Muriel MacDonagh for the insurrection's inevitable surrender. Plunkett was taken to Kilmainham gaol, where he was court martialled and sentenced to death. At 11.30 p.m. on 3 May 1916 Plunkett and Gifford were married in Kilmainham prison chapel. Gifford was allowed ten minutes to speak to her husband before his execution at 3.30 the following morning. She later said &#145;We who had never had enough time to say what we wanted to each other found that in the last ten minutes we couldn't talk at all&#146;  (Fox, 89). The marriage was widely reported, igniting worldwide public sympathy for the rising.<br>
<br>Gifford moved to the Plunkett family home, where she suffered a miscarriage. In August 1917 Muriel MacDonagh drowned, further traumatizing Gifford. She attempted to support herself by illustrating advertisements, but in 1917 a legacy of &pound;500 allowed her to focus on political work. She drew a portrait of her husband for a collection of his poetry, and during the Anglo-Irish war of independence promoted Sinn F&eacute;in policies through her caricatures, collected as <span class="italic">To Hold as 'Twere by Mrs Joseph Plunkett</span> (1919). The collection was warmly reviewed, with the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> praising its strength and daring.<br>
<br>Gifford withdrew her support for Sinn F&eacute;in in 1921, when its leader Arthur Griffith signed the treaty granting Ireland dominion status within the British empire. To Gifford and other opponents the treaty was a betrayal of the rising martyrs, and in the ensuing civil war Gifford became a prominent republican spokeswoman. On 6 February 1923 she was interned in Kilmainham gaol, spending three months there as a political prisoner, writing a short biography of Plunkett, painting her cell with a celebrated madonna and child, and participating in a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of the rising. She was released in May 1923, after pro-treaty forces won the civil war, yet she found it hard to resume her life in Dublin. With no home of her own and very little money, her status as a republican icon meant she could expect no help from the new Irish Free State. During the 1920s she led a nomadic life, moving from one small apartment to another, and struggling to support herself with commercial work.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1920s Gifford's reputation as a caricaturist was firmly established through her work for popular periodicals. In 1929, her collection <span class="italic">Twelve Nights at the Abbey Theatre</span> came out, introduced by Lady Augusta Gregory and running to a second edition in 1930. In 1932 her old republican ally Eamon De Valera came to power and granted Gifford a civil-list pension. Two years later, Gifford addressed a longstanding personal resentment by initiating a lawsuit against her late husband's parents for a share of his estate, winning &pound;700 and her legal costs in an out-of-court settlement.<br>
<br>Gifford spent the late 1930s and 1940s continuing her commercial and theatrical work and forging close relationships with nephews and nieces. Her later years were troubled by heart disease, and on 13 December 1955 she died suddenly at her home, 52 South Richmond Street, Dublin. She was buried at Glasnevin cemetery with full military honours. Obituaries paid tribute to her artistic work, religious faith, and staunch republicanism, but dwelt particularly on the tragic circumstances of her marriage in 1916.<br>
