<span class="headword">Bernard,  Simon Francis</span>  (1817&#150;1862), <span class="occ">revolutionary</span>, was born in rue des &Eacute;tudes, carr&eacute; des P&eacute;nitents Blancs, in Carcassonne, Aude, France, on 28 January 1817, the third son of Pierre Bernard (<i>b</i>. 1770/71), language teacher, and his wife, Gabrielle Rousseau. After some medical training he became a navy surgeon and in 1838 he took part in the expedition to Veracruz, Mexico. Back in France he was, from 1842, a journalist with such democratic newspapers as <span class="italic">L'Ind&eacute;pendant des Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es-Orientales</span> in Perpignan (1847&#150;8), and was also a socialist lecturer, promoting Fourierist views. Soon after the February 1848 revolution, he was appointed <i>inspecteur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'&eacute;conomie</i>. In April 1848 he organized a republican demonstration in Barcelona, was arrested and gaoled in Montjuich prison, and it seems was then released (and expelled to France) with the intervention of the French consul. He then arrived in Paris. Nicknamed Bernard le Clubiste, he founded the Club Bonne-Nouvelle, where his remarkable oratorical skills enabled him to &#145;fanaticise the masses&#146;, a hostile observer noted  (Lucas, 53). He was increasingly at odds with the political regime and, when he left France in May 1849, eight prosecutions had supposedly been instituted against him, including two gaol sentences in January 1849 for &#145;political misdemeanour&#146;  (Cordillot). He first went to Belgium, where he was tried, acquitted, and expelled, and then to Cologne, where he was expelled again; in December 1853, a brief visit to Germany also led to his expulsion, from Dresden.<br>
<br>For most of the period from 1851 to 1862 Bernard lived in London, which had become the European centre of political exile. Styled Dr Bernard, he used his medical knowledge to practise as a physician at 40 Regent Circus, Piccadilly, where he lived until 1853. His medical training proved too limited so, like many French refugees, he became a teacher of languages, living for several years at 10 Park Street, Bayswater. But his main occupation was that of a &#145;conspirer&#146;, as he described himself. Unmarried and with no known children, he was active among the political refugees of the capital. With his &#145;large massive face&#146;, &#145;bright, black eyes&#146;  (Lancet, 2), and moustache, he impressed those who met him by his determination, his boldness, and his fearlessness of prison and death. Politically a revolutionary <i>d&eacute;mocrate socialiste</i>, he did not belong to a particular tendency, though he was close to the Commune R&eacute;volutionnaire. Other French &#145;red republicans&#146;, F&eacute;lix Pyat, Alfred Talandier, and Fran&ccedil;ois D&eacute;sir&eacute; Le Blanc, were among his friends, as well as the British radicals George Jacob Holyoake and Charles Bradlaugh, and the Italian refugee Felice Orsini.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1858 Orsini and three other Italians tried to assassinate Napoleon III in Paris by throwing grenades at the emperor's carriage. The <i>attentat</i> failed to injure the imperial couple, but killed and wounded others. The four Italians were sentenced on 25 February and Orsini and Pieri were guillotined in Paris on 13 March. The French regime had long complained to the British government about the latter's lenient policy to the refugees. When it became clear that the attack had been planned in England, the grenades having been manufactured in Birmingham, French pressure on Palmerston's government mounted&#151;threatening addresses from the French colonels were published in the official paper <span class="italic">Le Moniteur</span>. The cabinet's first response was to introduce a <span class="roman">Conspiracy to Murder Bill</span>. Designed to clarify the law rather than extend it, the bill aimed to respond to French discontent, but was vulnerable to the charge that the government was altering English law to appease a foreign power. After a wave of radical protests, the bill failed in the House of Commons on 19 February 1858, and Palmerston resigned the next day.<br>
<br>The second response from the British authorities to the Orsini plot was to arrest Simon Bernard on 14 February. Lord Derby's government decided to bring an indictment against him as an accessory to the murder of the guards who died in Paris, for which punishment was death. Over &pound;5000 was spent to procure seventy-three witnesses to testify against Bernard, another of the accomplices, the writer Thomas Allsop, having fled to America. The trial began at the central criminal court on 12 April 1858, before the lord chief justice, Lord Campbell, the prosecution being led by Sir Fitzroy Kelly, the attorney-general. Although he refused to plead, Bernard appealed to English national sentiment, choosing to be judged by an all-English jury, whereas as a non-national he enjoyed the option of a jury half-composed of foreigners. His counsel, Edwin James, based his defence on the patriotic argument that the jury should throw out a political prosecution brought at the behest of a foreign despot:<blockquote>Tell [the French emperor] that the Jury-box is the sanctuary of liberty &hellip; Tell him that, though 600,000 French bayonets glittered before you, though the roar of French cannon thundered in your ears, you will return a verdict which your own breasts and consciences will sanctify and approve. (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 326&#150;7)</blockquote>The jury were evidently swayed by these sentiments: in the face of the evidence (the only doubt being whether Bernard could be proved to have been aware that the grenades he handed to Orsini were intended for the <i>attentat</i>), and despite a summing-up by Lord Campbell in favour of a conviction, Bernard was acquitted, amid tumultuous scenes, on 17 April 1858. Further charges against him were dropped, and he was released. Although Bernard's exact part in the 14 January <i>attentat</i> cannot easily be assessed, it is clear that he had been one of the organizers. As well as supplying Orsini with the grenades that were used, he had also sent pistols and money. He acknowledged, &#145;I have conspired &hellip; and I will ever conspire, against those who have destroyed liberty. It is the sacred duty of every man; but never&#151;never would I be a murderer!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reynolds's Newspaper</span>, 25 April 1858).<br>
<br>Bernard's acquittal had far-reaching consequences. Its immediate effect was to cause another prosecution intended as a gesture to the French authorities, against two publishers of pamphlets justifying tyrannicide, to be dropped. For nearly a generation, the memory of the failed prosecution inhibited the British authorities from attempting to strengthen, or even to enforce, English law against political refugees at the request of foreign governments  (Porter, 199).<br>
<br>Following his release Bernard continued to be involved in politics. In common with other French refugees he was a freemason, a member of the <i>loge des Philadelphes</i>, which was not admitted to the official English lodge because of its atheism. In 1862 he became mentally disturbed. By one account, a renegade was sent to beguile him and, not realizing that she was a spy, he spoke to her of his friends, causing them to be captured and shot by the foreign authorities. When he realized the consequence of his unguarded talk, he was said to have &#145;lost his reason&#146;  (Holyoake, 2.34). He had &#145;hallucinations&#146;, according to Marx, who knew him, and was confined at Brooke House lunatic asylum, Upper Clapton, London, where he died on 25 November 1862. He was buried at Kilburn cemetery. His funeral on 30 November was attended by some 800 people, including a significant part of London's political refugee population. Talandier, Bradlaugh, Pyat, Holyoake, and the freemason Gustave Jourdain were among the speakers; those who attended included Michael Bakunin and Alexander Herzen.<br>
