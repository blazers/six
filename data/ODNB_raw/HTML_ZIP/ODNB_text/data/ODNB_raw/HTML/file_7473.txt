<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dempster,  Thomas</span>  (1579&#150;1625), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was, by his own account, born on 23 August 1579, a date which has been accepted by those authorities who have written about him. The place of his birth was Cliftbog in Aberdeenshire, an estate belonging to his father, Thomas Dempster, laird of Muiresk, Auchterless, and Killesmont, who also seems to have held the office of lieutenant (<i>prorex</i>) of Banff and Buchan. His mother was Jean Leslie, daughter of William Leslie, ninth baron of Balquain. The couple, according to Dempster's autobiography, had twenty-nine children, of which he was the twenty-fourth. This statement has been taken at face value by Irving  (Irving, <span class="italic">Lives</span>, 1.347), but it is possible that Dempster was only the third son of three  (Leslie, vol. 3).<h2>
<a name="EarlylifeandeducationinScotland"></a>Early life and education in Scotland</h2>Dempster&#151;again by his own account&#151;learned the alphabet in one hour at the age of three. Whatever the truth of this, he was sent at an early age to school in Turreff, under the care of the schoolmaster Andrew Ogston. After this, he continued his education in the classics at Aberdeen, under Thomas Cargill, who later became rector of the grammar school there.<br>
<br>While Dempster was receiving this early education, his family became embroiled in an internal feud. This was caused by James, his eldest brother, marrying his father's mistress, Isabella Gordon, for which his father disinherited him. James sought revenge by gathering some Gordon associates and attacking his father as he rode about his business one morning. In the resultant battle several men on both sides were killed, and James Dempster fled Scotland. That he was disinherited is confirmed by a charter of 6 January 1592, which gives the barony of Muiresk to the elder Dempster's second son, Robert. If Thomas Dempster was only the third son, and his brother Robert died during his lifetime, he would have been justified in calling himself baron of Muiresk, as he did in later life. If, however, he was the twenty-fourth child as he claimed, it is highly unlikely that he ever inherited the honour. It was in any case an empty one, as the Muiresk estate was impoverished, and would have brought him no financial benefit even if he had legitimately been the tenth baron.<h2>
<a name="FurthereducationEnglandandEurope"></a>Further education: England and Europe</h2>This family chaos caused Dempster's uncle, John Dempster, an Edinburgh lawyer, to advise his nephew to leave Scotland. Taking this advice, Dempster went to Cambridge about 1589, and became a student at Pembroke College under a tutor called Walter Whalley. How long he stayed at Cambridge is uncertain, but he soon left for France, being robbed of all his money and most of his clothes on the journey and, with difficulty, eventually reaching Paris. Here he was assisted by some fellow Scots, and planned to continue his studies. He was prevented from doing this by a severe outbreak of plague, which killed many Parisians and which nearly killed him as well. When he recovered, he left for Louvain and entered the university there, but did not stay long. He was selected along with other Scottish students by the Jesuit William Crichton, principal of the Scottish College at Louvain, to be sent for further education in Rome. He reached that city after a hazardous journey through Germany and Italy, which were ravaged by war and plague at the time.<br>
<br>At Rome Dempster attracted the attention of Cardinal Cajetan, on whose recommendation he was admitted into the Roman seminary. Unfortunately, he again fell seriously ill, and doctors advised a change of climate. Accordingly, he set off for the Netherlands, travelling via Switzerland, in the company of another Scot, Andrew Crichton. At Tournai he met his fellow countryman James Cheyne, who had been professor at both Paris and Douai, and it was by Cheyne's advice that Dempster entered the latter university. He soon became disenchanted and planned to leave, but Cheyne persuaded him to complete the three-year course, and Dempster took the degree of MA at Douai. He was maintained during his studies by a pension from the king of Spain, and Archduke Albert, who governed the Spanish Netherlands. Following this, he taught briefly at Tournai, but soon left for Paris. Here he took a doctorate in canon law, and became a regent in the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre. Dempster asserts that he was seventeen at this time, which would mean that he took up his college position in 1596. This is unlikely, but not impossible in the seventeenth century when it was feasible for a precocious young man to attain academic distinctions that today would be associated with people much older. Dempster also seems to have become a doctor of civil law at about this time, but at what university is unknown. In later life, he described himself as a doctor of both branches of law.<h2>
<a name="AcademiccareertravelsandconflictinFranceandScotland"></a>Academic career: travels and conflict in France and Scotland</h2>Dempster soon continued his travels, visiting St Maixent in Poitou and becoming professor of humanities at Toulouse, a city which his involvement in &#145;town and gown&#146; battles soon obliged him to leave. He considered becoming professor of philosophy at Montpellier, on the invitation of two Scots, Adam Abernethy and Andrew Currie, but instead went to N&icirc;mes, where he became professor of eloquence as the result of a competition for the post, which he won. As N&icirc;mes was a Huguenot college, it is probable that Dempster concealed his Catholicism, although he usually presented himself in Europe as one who had abandoned a great estate in Scotland for the sake of his religion.<br>
<br>Dempster was not allowed to pursue his career in peace. One of the defeated competitors in the contest for the professorship, the Swiss Jacob Grasser, attacked him in print and tried to have him suspended from his duties. However, Dempster fought back successfully, and managed to have Grasser imprisoned at N&icirc;mes, and, when he escaped, in Paris. A two-year lawsuit followed, which the <i>parlement</i> of Toulouse eventually decided in Dempster's favour.<br>
<br>Despite this vindication, Dempster started travelling again. He made a brief visit to Spain, and, on his return to France, accepted a position as tutor to Arthur l'Espinay, the son of the famous soldier Marshal de Saint-Luc and later bishop of Marseilles. He lost this post almost immediately by quarrelling with one of his charge's relations at Brissac, and decided to return to his homeland. Here, however, he found that most of his relations were too poor to be of any assistance to him, and that his Catholicism was a severe drawback. The Scottish protestant clergy appear to have harassed him, and, according to his autobiography, he engaged in a three-day theological dispute with William Cowper, later bishop of Galloway, which he claims he won. The truth of this story is uncertain, but Dempster certainly seems to have had a grudge against Cowper, whom he treated abusively in his <span class="italic">Historia</span> and damned as a heretic.<br>
<br>As Scotland had nothing to offer, Dempster returned to Europe about 1608, and was employed for seven years as regent in the four Paris colleges of Lisieux, Grassins, Du Plessis, and Beauvais. While at Paris, he published in 1613 his edition of Rosinus's <span class="italic">Antiquitatum Romanorum corpus</span>, which he dedicated to James VI and I of Scotland and England.<br>
<br>It was while at the Coll&egrave;ge de Beauvais that Dempster became involved in an affair which caused him to leave France again. His own version of the story is that he left because a Norman called Jean Robillard tried to assassinate him for some unspecified reason. A more circumstantial account, repeated by Irving  (Irving, <span class="italic">Lives</span>, 1.353), states that the trouble was caused by Dempster's public flogging of a student who had challenged another to a duel. The young man tried to avenge this humiliation by bringing three soldier relations to the college in order to attack Dempster, who armed his servants, ordered the killing of his assailants' horses to prevent their escape, and led a counter-attack so successful that he overpowered his adversaries and locked them up in the college bell-tower. Legal proceedings would certainly have followed this episode, and as Dempster was unsure as to what the outcome of these would be, he left France.<h2>
<a name="Englandroyalfavourandmarriage"></a>England: royal favour and marriage</h2>Dempster went to England, where he had been previously invited by King James, who considered himself a scholar and who had been flattered by the dedication in the <span class="italic">Antiquitatum Romanorum corpus</span>. He arrived there in 1615 or early 1616. The king awarded him the sum of &pound;200 on 19 February 1616, and seems to have appointed him historiographer royal for England. This arguably makes Dempster the first holder of this office, although the unbroken line of English historiographers royal only begins in 1661  (Hay, 24, 31). While in London, he married Susanna Waller. The couple later had one child, a daughter, who lived only a few days after her birth. Dempster might have begun a successful career in England, but once again his religion proved a stumbling block. The English clergy, led by Dr Montagu, the bishop of Bath and Wells, criticized him to the king and convinced him that it was improper for the king of a protestant country to show such favour to a professed Catholic. Realizing that he would never prosper with such opposition, Dempster left England, having stayed only a short time.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEuropeandsuccessinItaly"></a>Return to Europe and success in Italy</h2>Dempster made his way to Rome where he was arrested on suspicion of espionage, and briefly imprisoned. He easily proved this suspicion baseless and soon left for Florence. In Rome he had become friendly with Gucciardini, the Tuscan ambassador to the papal court, and it was on Gucciardini's recommendation, supported by that of the pope, that he was appointed professor of the pandects at the University of Pisa by the grand duke of Tuscany, Cosimo II, in 1616.<br>
<br>Shortly after his appointment, Dempster went back to England to fetch his wife. The couple travelled to Pisa by way of France, where Mrs Dempster caused commotion by appearing with more flesh exposed than was normally the case in France. The crowd she attracted grew so dense and disorderly that the Dempsters were obliged to take refuge in a house. The rest of the journey, however, was uneventful, and they reached Pisa in time for Dempster to deliver his inaugural lecture on 2 November. Their short-lived daughter was born soon after they arrived in Italy.<br>
<br>Dempster at last showed signs of prospering. His salary was increased to 400 ducats a year, and he began work on his <span class="italic">De Etruria regali</span>, a project which pleased the grand duke as it dealt with the history of the part of Italy which formed his duchy. Dempster appears to have been an enthusiastic and dedicated scholar, who wrote and studied for fourteen hours a day, when possible, and had so powerful a memory that he was known as the Living Library. He was equally fluent in Latin and Greek, and dictated in these languages so rapidly that no pen could keep up. He also seems to have been thorough about research, and in 1617 again visited Britain, in order to obtain books for use in writing the <span class="italic">Etruria</span>.<br>
<br>In 1619 Dempster's career at Pisa came to an end. He became involved in a dispute with an unnamed English ecclesiastic, who seems to have had the ear of the grand duke, and who managed to convince that ruler that Dempster was in the wrong. The duke gave Dempster a choice of apologizing or of leaving Tuscany. Refusing to apologize, Dempster left Pisa on 21 July 1619. His intention appears to have been to try his luck in Scotland again, but on his way he stopped at Bologna to visit Cardinal Capponi, who convinced him to stay in Italy. The cardinal also managed to obtain for him within twelve days the professorship of humanities at the University of Bologna, at that time the most prestigious seat of learning in Italy.<h2>
<a name="Accusationsofheresy"></a>Accusations of heresy</h2>Trouble, however, continued to follow Dempster. The English priest with whom he had clashed at Pisa renewed his attacks, accusing Dempster of being a doubtful Catholic and of possessing heretical books. Dempster did not help his case by writing the Englishman a furious letter, which his enemy had translated into Italian and presented as evidence against its writer. He succeeded in gaining the support of several cardinals, and Dempster was obliged to go to Rome personally in order to defend himself in audience with the pope. A reconciliation was eventually staged between Dempster and the English foe, but the accusations caused the Inquisition in Rome to regard Dempster with continued suspicion. A decree dated 16 March 1621 condemned his edition of Rosinus, and a further one of December 1623 prohibited another of his works.<h2>
<a name="Bolognafamilyproblemsanddeath"></a>Bologna: family problems and death</h2>Dempster's career now flourished. He attracted many students to Bologna, and evidently lost his urge to wander, as he turned down the offer of a professorship of civil law at Padua, although the salary there was larger than that which he received at Bologna. A new pope, Urban VIII, himself a keen Latinist, knighted him and granted him an annual pension. He was also made a member of the distinguished Academia della Notte.<br>
<br>In 1625 Dempster's wife eloped with a lover, assisted by some of Dempster's own students and taking with her some of her husband's property. He set off in pursuit, and got as far as Vicenza, where he learned that the fugitives had crossed the Alps and were out of Italy. Abandoning the chase, he went to Butri, near Bologna, to rest. Here he caught a fever, which made it necessary to move him to his home in Bologna, where he died on 6 September 1625. He was buried in St Dominic's Church in that city, where his fellow members of the Academia della Notte erected a monumental stone with a Latin inscription in his memory.<h2>
<a name="TheHistoriaecclesiasticagentisScotorum"></a>The Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum</h2>Dempster listed fifty of his own works, a list which is reproduced by Irving  (Irving, <span class="italic">Lives</span>, 1.363&#150;70), who also admitted that there is no confirmation for items twenty-nine to forty-seven on the list except Dempster himself. Considering his working habits, it is certainly possible that Dempster produced a large volume of work, but when and where he wrote most of the items on his list is unknown. The work for which he is most famous, or notorious, is the <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum</span>, first published in Bologna in 1627, two years after his death. Despite the title, this is not an ecclesiastical history of Scotland, but a descriptive catalogue of supposedly Scottish writers and saints. It includes people whose existence is doubtful, and lists books which are almost certainly fictitious. Dempster claimed as Scots many early figures who were more likely Irish, but this might be the result of genuine confusion, because the term Scotia was used to describe both Ireland and Scotland until at least the eleventh century, after which its use was increasingly limited to Scotland. Besides this, Dempster also claimed as Scots such unarguably non-Scottish figures as Alcuin, the noted Carolingian scholar, St Boniface, and even Boudicca (Boadicea), the Icenic queen who fought the Romans in the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. Not only is she made out to be Scottish, but she is also attributed with the authorship of several books. His descriptions of other historical figures have been considered more valuable, although they are sometimes distorted by Catholic prejudice; Dempster invented an imaginary work attacking Wyclif by a fourteenth-century Scottish hermit called Grant, and plainly thought that the early Scottish protestants Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart were justly burned at the stake.<br>
<br>Dempster's reasons for exaggerating the number of early Scottish writers were almost certainly patriotic. As David Allan has pointed out  (Allan, <span class="italic">Virtue</span>, 197, 222), he is only one of a number of Scottish historians who, over the centuries, have tried to present the dark ages as an era of learning in Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Otherworks"></a>Other works</h2>Charges of fraud have not been levelled against Dempster's other writings. These, even if half his list is disregarded for lack of evidence, are numerous and varied. His <span class="italic">De Etruria regali</span> was much admired and is regarded by Irving as his best work  (Irving, <span class="italic">Lives</span>, 1.360). His edition of Rosinus was also commended, and subsequent writers on Roman antiquities used it as a source. Dempster also produced some small works on Roman law, commentaries on the works of the late Roman poets Claudian and Corippus, and some original Latin verse, which was highly regarded by his contemporaries.<h2>
<a name="Reputationtothepresentday"></a>Reputation to the present day</h2>In the seventeenth century Scots seem to have regarded Dempster as a writer of whom to be proud, and an example of the once-great literary tradition from which late seventeenth-century Scotland was seen to have fallen  (Allan, &#145;Prudence&#146;, 473). At the same time, however, non-Scots such as Towers and Bishop Lloyd denounced him for the exaggerations and lies of the <span class="italic">Historia</span>. In the eighteenth century Dempster appears to have vanished into the obscurity created by Scottish enlightenment belief that the seventeenth century was a dark age for Scottish letters, a belief to which the lamentations of late seventeenth-century Scottish writers had contributed. He resurfaced briefly in the nineteenth century during the period of Scottish antiquarian enthusiasm associated with Sir Walter Scott, and his <span class="italic">Historia</span>, edited by David Irving, was published for the Bannatyne Club in Edinburgh in 1829. Irving also included Dempster among the illustrious Scots he described in his <span class="italic">Lives of Scotish Writers</span>, published in 1839. Irving's account takes Dempster to task for the falsifications of the <span class="italic">Historia</span>, and these features of Dempster's work are what subsequent writers have concentrated upon, when they mention Dempster at all. This reputation for dishonesty, or, more charitably, credulity, and the fact that Dempster wrote entirely in Greek or Latin, is probably largely responsible for his not having received much in the way of serious scholarly attention.<br>
