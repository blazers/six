<span class="headword">Bell,  (George) Douglas Hutton</span>  (1905&#150;1993), <span class="occ">plant scientist</span>, was born at 37 Glanmor Crescent, Swansea, on 18 October 1905, the elder son of George Henry Bell, civil engineer, and his wife, Lilian Mary Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hutton. His father worked principally for municipal authorities in the Swansea area. His mother was related by marriage to the Massachusetts philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose well known aphorism, &#145;If a man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mousetrap than his neighbour, though he build his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door&#146;, could well have been applied to Bell in his middle age, at the height of his creativity in plant breeding. Bell was educated at schools in the Swansea area, first at the Brymill primary school from 1913 to 1918 and then at Bishop Gore's Grammar School from 1918 to 1924. The arts side at school appealed to Bell more than the sciences. He particularly liked English usage, which was taught by D. T. Thomas (the father of Dylan). This teaching stayed with Bell throughout his life as those who subsequently were his students and junior colleagues learned when they split infinitives or commenced lists with &#145;Firstly&#146;.<br>
<br>After school Bell went up to the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he graduated with a first in botany and agricultural botany in 1928. He had chosen these subjects because he had experienced the food shortages of the First World War and he had become concerned about famines in other parts of the world. Sir Rowland Biffen, professor of agricultural botany at Cambridge, had been the external examiner of Bell's BSc and had seized his attention, so when Bell was awarded a research studentship by the Ministry of Agriculture he naturally sought to take it up at Cambridge. For his PhD in the Cambridge school of agriculture, Bell chose to study the distinctions between barley varieties, and in this work he was supervised by Sir Frank Engledow. He was greatly assisted by being allowed to spend a year in the USA at the University of Idaho, where he could compare the barley varieties that he had studied on the university farm in Cambridge in the very different environment of Idaho. In Idaho he had the good fortune to work alongside Dr H. V. Harlan, the foremost barley scientist of his day. When he submitted his PhD thesis in 1931 it had not been read by Engledow until it was bound and ready for submission.<br>
<br>Having succeeded in taking the PhD degree Bell stayed in Cambridge as an assistant research officer in the Plant Breeding Institute of the school of agriculture, where he helped Biffen and Engledow with their breeding programmes in wheat and barley. In 1933 he was appointed university demonstrator and his commitment to wheat and barley breeding continued with, in addition, some attention paid to pea breeding. With the security of a demonstrator's salary, he was able to marry, on 3 September 1934, Eileen Gertrude Wright (1905/6&#150;1993), daughter of Alfred Wright, retired jeweller; they had first met on a transatlantic liner when returning from the USA. Their happy union lasted until their deaths within a few days of each other fifty-nine years later. There were two daughters.<br>
<br>Bell was appointed university lecturer in 1944. During the war his attention was concentrated on very practical affairs, including bolting and seed production in sugar beet&#151;sugar being in very short supply in the wartime period. He also researched the use of tuber fragments as seed in potato production. But his continued attention to barley resulted in real progress towards the development of winter varieties.<br>
<br>Often someone's life story can be written in the history of an institution. This is very much the case with Bell and the Plant Breeding Institute, Cambridge. He was its acting director from 1946, and in January 1948 became director with the appointment backdated to October 1947. This appointment was in accord with an agreement among the university, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Agricultural Research Council that the institute should be separated from the university and become jointly the responsibility of the ministry and the council. This arrangement was to continue until 1955 when responsibility for the institute would fall to the council alone. Bell was given the responsibility of building an independent institute which, by research, was to improve the agricultural industry of the drier and primarily arable sector of eastern Britain. The mission statement for the institute spoke of the need for pure and applied scientific research on plant breeding for the betterment of agriculture, the production of new varieties, the development of new techniques and the support of appropriate research. From 1947 until 1971 (the time that he directed the institute) and indeed afterwards Bell was the doyen of plant breeding in Britain. From scratch he built a research establishment in which the very practical research needed to serve the industry was carried out alongside underpinning research in plant physiology and pathology, in genetics, cytogenetics, and molecular biology, in entomology, statistics, and chemistry. Starting with a staff of three in 1947 he had recruited a total staff of 231 by 1971, when he retired. Since there was no pre-existing model for such an institution, unusual creativity was needed by Bell in its generation.<br>
<br>The Ministry of Agriculture had bought Anstey Hall Farm, Trumpington, just to the south of Cambridge, at Bell's instigation in March 1950. Here the institute's premises were constructed and eventually all of the farm's 153 hectares were brought into experimental use. It had a friable, free draining, sandy clay loam soil overlying chalk marl, in great contrast to the land on which Bell had worked at the Cambridge University farm, which was unforgiving gault clay, inaccessible after rain. Bell often debated the balance of the institute's programme between pure and applied research, but eventually concluded that there could be no separation because breeding improved varieties must involve the use of the most up-to-date knowledge and methods from pure science. As a result, the programme of the Plant Breeding Institute extended from very practical work aimed at producing varieties to strategic work in relevant scientific disciplines. This structure was aimed at changing plant breeding from being a complex craft which made occasional references to science but relied principally on the eye and the intuition of the breeder into a science-based technology. Despite the reluctance of some of the old hands this objective was successfully achieved.<br>
<br>At its fullest stretch the objectives of the institute were to produce new varieties of barley, wheat, oats, triticale, potato, marrow-stemmed kale, field beans, red clover, maize, oil-seed rape, lucerne, and various species of forage grass. Bell's leadership was based upon the remarkable achievements of his personal large-scale breeding programmes in barley. The pinnacle of his success with barley came with the release of the spring barley variety Proctor in 1953. Because of its high yield, lodging resistant short straw, malting quality, and resistance to <i>Rhyncosporium</i>, Proctor was widely accepted by farmers. It transformed British agriculture. When it was introduced in 1953 there were 0.9 million hectares of barley in Britain, but by 1963 there were 2.4 million hectares. In 1956 the area in barley exceeded that in oats for the first time since 1879, while by 1966 barley occupied more than half of the national area under tillage and 70 per cent of this area was sown to Proctor. This variety satisfied the needs of the newly intensified, mechanized agriculture, where barley was replacing oats as the principal feed for livestock.<br>
<br>By the time of his retirement Bell could look back on a life in which he had succeeded in attaining all the practical objectives he had set himself in agriculture and for agricultural research. As would be expected in the light of his contributions to the transformation of British agriculture he received many honours. He was a fellow of Selwyn College over the period 1944&#150;54 and became an honorary fellow in 1965. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1965 and appointed CBE in the same year. Among many other honours he was awarded the Mullard medal of the Royal Society in 1967 and the Massey-Ferguson national award of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1973. He died of bronchopneumonia at the Humanitas Foundation, Bottisham, Cambridgeshire, on 27 June 1993; he was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
