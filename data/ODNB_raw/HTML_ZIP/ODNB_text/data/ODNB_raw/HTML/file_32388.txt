<span class="headword">Cheesman,  Robert Ernest</span>  (1878&#150;1962), <span class="occ">explorer and naturalist</span>, was born at Westwell, Kent, on 18 October 1878, the eldest son and second of five children of Robert Cheesman, farmer, and his wife, Florence Maud Tassell. His younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57174/', "(Lucy) Evelyn Cheesman (1881&#150;1969)")</script>, became a well-known entomologist, traveller, writer, and broadcaster. Cheesman was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, and Wye Agricultural College. He then worked for Sharpe and Winch, brewers, of Cranbrook, Kent. He was a keen ornithologist. As a boy he tried to rear wood pigeon squabs by swallowing and regurgitating clover leaves, like the mother bird. He was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union in 1908, and in 1912&#150;14 contributed notes to <span class="italic">British Birds</span>.<br>
<br>In 1914 Cheesman enlisted in the Buffs, misrepresenting his age. He served in India and in the attempted relief of Kut. In 1916 he met Sir Percy Cox, then political officer to the Mesopotamian expeditionary force, who shared his enthusiasm for birds. Together they undertook to collect the avifauna of Iraq. Cox wanted to organize the growing of vegetables for the troops and persuaded Cheesman to take a commission (1916) in the Indian army reserve of officers. Cheesman then became assistant to the deputy director of agriculture. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Notes on Vegetable Growing in Mesopotamia in 1917</span> was published officially in 1918. While Cox was high commissioner in Iraq, Cheesman was his private secretary (1920&#150;23). He was elected to the British Ornithologists' Club in 1919, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1920, and a corresponding member of the Zoological Society of London in 1921.<br>
<br>In 1921 Cheesman mapped the Arabian coast from &#145;Uqair to the head of the Gulf of Salwa. He was appointed OBE in 1923. In 1923&#150;4 he spent eleven weeks at Hufuf and then travelled to Jabrin; he fixed its position, mapped 150 miles of the desert, identified the site of ancient Gerra, and corrected serious mistakes about the wadi system. He received the Royal Geographical Society's Gill memorial award in 1925 for this journey, which he described in <span class="italic">In Unknown Arabia</span> (1926). In 1925 he became consul for north-west Ethiopia, resident at Dangila, as a member of the Sudan political service. Officially he was much concerned with preventing elephant poachers from entering Sudan, but he used every opportunity for exploration. He visited the source of the Blue Nile several times, first in March 1926. He mapped the river from Tisisat to Wanbera in January&#150;April 1927, returning to Dangila through little-known country. He completed the map from Wanbera to the frontier in February&#150;April 1929. He explored the river from its source to Lake Tana, correcting many cartographical errors, in 1932. He circumnavigated the lake, landing on all the bigger islands and making a compass traverse of the coast, in November 1932&#150;April 1933. He retired in 1934, was made a commander of the Star of Ethiopia, and was appointed CBE (1935). He received the Royal Geographical Society's patron's medal in 1936 for his explorations, which he described in <span class="italic">Lake Tana and the Blue Nile</span> (1936).<br>
<br>In 1927 Cheesman married Catherine, daughter of William Francis Winch, estate agent and brewer, of Cranbrook; they had no children. In 1928 he resigned from the reserve as major, and after he retired in 1934 he and his wife lived at her fifteenth-century house, Tilsden, outside Cranbrook, where they farmed together. In 1940, at the request of the governor-general of Sudan, Cheesman became head of the Ethiopian section of intelligence, Sudan defence force, first as bimbashi, then as colonel. Notes and bearings he had taken previously now proved valuable. It was largely on his recommendation that O. C. Wingate selected his first objective in the invasion of Ethiopia. In 1942 Cheesman became oriental counsellor at the legation, Addis Ababa. In 1944 he retired finally to Cranbrook, having been mentioned in dispatches in both wars. The farm was sold after his wife's death in 1958, but he continued to live quietly at Tilsden. He died on 13 February 1962 at the Lonsdale Nursing Home in Tunbridge Wells.<br>
<br>On all his travels Cheesman assiduously collected specimens of fauna, flora, and minerals, nearly all of which he presented to the British Museum. They included several new species of mammals and insects. He described them in articles on which he collaborated with professional taxonomists in <span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span> (1919&#150;28), <span class="italic">Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society</span> (1920&#150;26), and <span class="italic">Ibis</span> (1923&#150;36). He contributed occasionally to the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span> (1923&#150;60). His books are both readable and authoritative, characterized by modesty, a sense of humour, and accurate observation, especially of topography and wildlife. In temperament and tastes he was a countryman: deliberate, patient, thorough, kind, and personally frugal. Never pretending to expertise he did not possess, he did whatever was possible to ensure that his travels should benefit every branch of knowledge.<br>
