<span class="headword">Stuart,  James</span>  (1775&#150;1849), <span class="occ">landowner, politician, and factory inspector</span>, was the eldest son of Dr Charles Stuart (1745/6&#150;1826), of Dunearn in Fife, and Mary, the daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8870/', "Revd Dr John Erskine")</script>. His father was minister of Cramond, on the Firth of Forth, and later a physician in Edinburgh who, after graduating MD from the University of Edinburgh in 1781, established the Anabaptist community in the city. His son James attended Edinburgh high school from 1785 to 1789 before studying at Edinburgh University from 1790 to 1797. James Stuart was apprenticed to Hugh Robertson, writer to the signet, and became a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet in 1798. On 29 April 1802 he married Eleanor Anna, only daughter of Dr Robert Moubray, of Cockairnie, Fife. They had no children.<br>
<br>Although Stuart was collector of the widows' fund of the Society of Writers to the Signet from 1818 to 1828, his main interest was in farming his estates in Fife, particularly in breeding large beef cattle. He played an active role in county affairs as deputy lieutenant and justice of the peace; but his outspoken whig sympathies upset the tory gentry. In December 1815, when a new commission of the peace was issued for Fife, the lord lieutenant, the earl of Morton, tried to exclude him. However Stuart's whig supporters petitioned successfully for his reappointment. He was also deeply involved in the very fraught Edinburgh politics of the period, speaking out clearly against the tory-controlled town council. The strength of his opinions and the forcefulness of his onslaughts, often accompanied by threats of physical violence, against tory opponents earned him a certain notoriety throughout Scotland. However, he was a complex man with intellectual interests, particularly in collecting antiquarian books. During the &#145;radical war&#146; of 1820, he was reprimanded by the earl of Morton for drilling a troop of Fife yeomanry against orders. Stuart took exception and resigned his commission in a fit of pique, but not before engaging Morton in lengthy correspondence which he later published as a political tract.<br>
<br>In December 1820 some Edinburgh tories, irritated by attacks from the whig press, established a newspaper, <span class="italic">The Beacon</span>, printed by Duncan Stevenson. The first issue, which appeared in January 1821, contained unwarranted criticisms of the whigs. On 28 July 1821, the Saturday after the coronation of George IV, <span class="italic">The Beacon</span> accused Stuart of supporting the queen. Furious, Stuart demanded the name of the author from Stevenson, who, thoroughly scared, went into hiding. Stuart caught and horsewhipped him in Parliament Square on 15 August. Both Stevenson and Stuart published lengthy tracts justifying their behaviour. Subsequently <span class="italic">The Beacon</span> libelled Stuart's friend and fellow whig John Gibson of Ingleston. In the ensuing trial it emerged that Stevenson was supported by many leading tories, including the lord advocate, Sir William Rae. On learning this news Stuart challenged Rae to a duel unless he disavowed his connection with the newspaper. When Rae gave way, Gibson challenged Sir Walter Scott, another of Stevenson's backers. In October 1821 the tory-controlled <span class="italic">Glasgow Sentinel</span> published a scurrilous poem about the whigs which contained the couplet:<blockquote>
<div>There's a stot feeder Stuart,<br>
</div>
<div>Kent for the fat-cow art.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Stuart took exception to this and other articles in which his name appeared and again demanded to know the name of the author, even apparently going in disguise to Glasgow to negotiate with the erstwhile partner of the publisher, William Murray Borthwick, who had been declared bankrupt. He persuaded him to give him the name of the author. On learning it was Sir Alexander Boswell of Auchinleck, Stuart issued yet another of the challenges to a duel. He and Boswell were arrested in Edinburgh that night and bound over to keep the peace, so the duel was fought in Fife, on 26 March 1822. Boswell was seriously injured and died the next day. Stuart fled to France, but gave himself up to stand trial for murder. Amid intense public interest, he was found not guilty.<br>
<br>After his acquittal Stuart took less part in politics, continuing to live in Edinburgh and Fife and devoting much of his time to gardening. In 1828 he became bankrupt, describing himself in the proceedings as a &#145;Writer to the Signet and Banker&#146;. All his effects, including his enormous collection of books, were sold in an auction that extended over fourteen days. He was forced to resign as collector of the widows' fund and went to America. After his return in 1831 he published an account of his travels, <span class="italic">Three Years in North America</span> (1833). A best-seller, the book was controversial, supporting the view in the United States about the poor conduct of the British troops during the campaign of 1814&#150;15, particularly of their destruction of the White House and of the congressional library. The British commanders, Sir John Lambert and Major Pringle, reacted angrily in the press and in pamphlets to these accusations.<br>
<br>In the early 1830s Stuart became editor of the London whig <span class="italic">Courier</span> newspaper. He tried to improve circulation by publishing a weekly review supplement. His political sympathies were rewarded in 1833, when he was invited to become a member of the factory commission and to report on the employment of children in factories in Scotland and Ulster&#151;an office for which he seems to have had no qualifications except an ability to write reports and his friendship with Leonard Horner. When Horner changed his responsibilities in 1836, Stuart succeeded him as factory inspector for the north of England and Scotland, a post he held for the remainder of his life. The job involved extensive travel and correspondence. Judging from his annual reports, Stuart was a conscientious inspector and like Horner went out of his way to help factory owners comply with the regulations.<br>
<br>In later life Stuart became a devoted disciple of the phrenologist George Combe. He died on 3 November 1849 at his home, 4 Boyne Terrace, Kensington, London and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
