<span class="headword">Simms,  William</span>  (1793&#150;1860), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born on 7 December 1793 in Birmingham, the second of nine children of William Simms (1763&#150;1828), toy maker, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson (1767&#150;1834). In 1794 the family moved to London where the father turned to the manufacture of marine compasses. William was apprenticed to Thomas Penstone, a working goldsmith, in 1808, and turned over to his father the following year to complete his apprenticeship, taking his freedom in the Goldsmiths' Company in 1815. He married Ann Nutting in 1819 and set up house in Islington where several children were born. He worked alongside his father and brothers at Bowman's Buildings, off Aldersgate Street, London, until 1826, when he entered into partnership with Edward Troughton (1753&#150;1835), the most respected astronomical instrument maker of his day. It seems that James South introduced the two men; certainly Troughton employed William Simms as an outworker from at least 1823, and by June 1824, writing to the astronomer royal, Joshua Pond, could refer to him as &#145;the best [workman] I know&#146;  (Royal Society, MS Gh. 1. 30). Simms was certainly keen to improve his skill at hand-dividing large instruments, as his notebook shows, and to educate himself generally. He and his brothers were among the members of the London Mechanics' Institution, founded in 1824. He became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1828.<br>
<br>When Troughton and Simms joined forces, Simms moved to Troughton's house at 136 Fleet Street where his wife cared for the elderly bachelor. The partnership prospered, supplying superb major instruments for observatories at Greenwich, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Lucknow, Madras, and Cracow, for many private observatories, and for the survey of India under Captain George Everest, besides selling numerous lesser surveying, navigational, and mathematical instruments. When Troughton died in 1835 Simms wisely continued to trade as Troughton and Simms, and he inherited from Troughton the onerous duty of supplying and maintaining the apparatus at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. In 1838 the firm displaced W. D. and T. Gilbert as suppliers to the East India Company, and thus gained access to a vast market for mathematical and surveying instruments for the company's engineers, revenue officers, and schools. Another line of business which Simms dominated was that of producing standards of length. Building on Troughton's reputation, he benefited from the rising demand for accurate standards for trigonometrical surveys in Ireland, India, the United States of America, and elsewhere. When the national standards were lost in the fire which destroyed the houses of parliament in 1834, the authorities turned immediately to Simms as the most reliable contractor to construct replacements&#151;a lengthy business which involved countless hours of tests and experiments to determine the best metal, the best shape of bar, and the corrections for temperature.<br>
<br>Several of the Simms family found employment with Troughton and Simms. William's sons William Henry (<i>b</i>. 1820) and James (1828&#150;1919) were bound apprentice to him in 1834 and 1843 respectively, while his nephew William (1817&#150;1907) joined him in 1836. His brother-in-law John Nutting kept the books until his early death around 1837, when brother Henry Simms (<i>b</i>. 1800) succeeded to the post. William's brother Frederick Walter Simms (1803&#150;1865), who had been employed on the Irish survey and then as an assistant at the Greenwich observatory before taking up the profession of railway engineer, wrote several books on surveying and the use of instruments in which he publicized Troughton and Simms instruments, thus carrying their fame still further afield. In 1846 Simms took as apprentice Joseph Beck, the fee of 200 guineas for this binding reflecting his high status in the trade.<br>
<br>Simms's residence in Fleet Street brought him obligations: he served as constable of St Bride's parish in 1836 and as a trustee from 1836 to 1839. After the death of his first wife, about 1840, William married Emma Hennell, and raised several more children. In 1841 the collapse, following a fire, of two houses adjacent to his own brought an opportunity for limited expansion. Simms leased no. 138 and erected a new house on Fleet Street with workshops behind, and moved into his new premises by 1844. He moved his own family to Carshalton around this time. The new workshops, like the old ones, were reached through the narrow entrance to Peterborough Court and this restriction obliged him to continue the practice of putting out all the casting and turning of large items, usually to the engineering firms of Maudslay and Field or Donkin, both of which were situated on the south bank of the Thames. The smaller instruments were graduated in house; Simms constructed the first self-acting dividing engine, driven, like clockwork, by a falling weight which moved down the exterior wall of the workshop. It was completed by 1843, to much acclaim in the engineering world. Troughton had built an observatory on the roof of no. 136 for testing his astronomical instruments before they were sent out, and Simms replicated this when he moved to no. 138. He was a keen astronomer, building an observatory at his Carshalton home. He had been a member of the Astronomical Society since 1831, serving from time to time on its council and joining the Astronomical Dining Club, so that he was on familiar terms with his more important customers.<br>
<br>In 1852 twenty leading astronomers and engineers proposed Simms for election to the Royal Society, testifying that he was:<blockquote>the author of several papers &hellip; the inventor of a self-acting machine for dividing circles &hellip; distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of practical optics and astronomical mechanics &hellip; eminent as an astronomical observer and as an artist in the construction of philosophical apparatus, telescopes, instruments etc.</blockquote>Despite this tribute to a man who was universally admired for his skill and respected for his kind, modest, and gentle nature, there were by then ominous signs that Troughton and Simms was neither maintaining its high standard nor keeping up with technical developments. There were justified complaints about defects in several costly astronomical instruments, notably those consigned to Harvard, and rumbles of dissatisfaction from India, where the levels fitted to Simms's theodolites had to be replaced by German ones. In England, too, Airy was recognizing the superiority of German instruments.<br>
<br>Simms died at Carshalton on 21 June 1860 and was buried at Norwood cemetery. His estate, which included the goodwill and assets of the firm, was valued at just under &pound;80,000. Simms's son James (1828&#150;1915) entered into a partnership with his cousin William (1817&#150;1907), which lasted until the latter retired in 1871. In 1864 the partners built new workshops at Charlton, Kent, where they remained until 1922 when failing business led to an amalgamation with one of their main competitors, Thomas Cooke &amp; Sons of York, owned by Vickers. The company was re-formed as Cooke, Troughton, and Simms, and the Charlton business relocated in York, where it continued until 1988 (by then known as Vickers Instruments) when Vickers, having no further use for it, sold off the business assets and closed it down.<br>
