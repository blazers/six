<span class="headword">Railton,  Reid Antony</span>  (1895&#150;1977), <span class="occ">motor engineer</span>, was born on 24 June 1895 at Cherry Tree House, Alderley Edge, in the Cheshire stockbroker belt, the son of Charles Withington Railton (1856&#150;1937), stock and share broker, whose family had followed that profession for several generations, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharman (1867&#150;1937), an attorney's daughter from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. He attended Rugby School but, while his elder brother took up the family profession, followed his own path by entering Manchester University about 1913 to study for a BSc.<br>
<br>On graduating in 1915, Railton was offered a job at Leyland Motors in Lancashire where he became assistant to the experimental engineer John Parry Thomas of whom Railton later said, &#145;he taught me how to think and such ability as I have as an engineer I owe entirely to his teaching&#146;  (Ludvigsen, 6). Though Leyland made buses and lorries, in 1917 Thomas and his assistant were asked to design a luxury car. The Leyland Eight was exhibited at the Olympia motor show in 1920 and was much admired with an impressive top speed of 130 m.p.h. Economic conditions were tough, however, so Leyland decided to concentrate on their core market and cancelled the project in 1922. Only fourteen chassis are believed to have been built, two of which were sold to the maharajah of Patiala. Railton was sent, in lieu of a workshop manual, to explain the car's workings to his highness's garage staff.<br>
<br>In 1923 Thomas left Leyland Motors to set up his own company at Brooklands motor racing circuit in Surrey. Also part of the enterprise was his financial backer Kenneth Thomson and engineer Kenneth Taylor. Railton decided to move on too. He set himself up in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, where he designed a vehicle with an innovative engine called the Arab. As he prepared to go into production tragic events intervened. In March 1927 Railton drove to Pendine Sands in Wales to watch Thomas attempt to regain the land speed record from Malcolm Campbell in his racing special, Babs. He arrived to find that his friend had just been killed in a high-speed crash. Railton was so upset that he closed his company down though only a few cars had been completed. Thomas's partners set up a new firm called Thomson and Taylor (Brooklands) Ltd (T&amp;T) and Railton accepted an invitation to join them as their chief engineer.<br>
<br>Railton's first commission was to complete a sports version of the Riley Nine started by Thomas. After the car went into production T&amp;T were retained to service the Riley racing team, with Railton and Taylor as the &#145;works mechanics&#146;. This provided excellent experience in problem-solving and maximizing performance. On 11 February 1928 he married Margaret Audrey (<i>b</i>. 1900), daughter of James Hensman, tea merchant. They went to live near Brooklands where they had a son and daughter between 1934 and 1936.<br>
<br>In 1929 Malcolm Campbell was looking to recover the land speed record from Henry Segrave who had achieved 231 m.p.h. at Daytona in his Golden Arrow. Campbell's car, Blue Bird, dated from 1923 and could not challenge this speed. He went to T&amp;T for assistance. There was no time to build a new car and funds were limited so Railton began an extensive rebuild of the existing car which lasted throughout 1930. The modified Blue Bird went on to break a number of records at Daytona Beach, finally reaching 253 m.p.h. Campbell was not satisfied so an upgraded engine was fitted along with further chassis modifications. Campbell achieved 301 m.p.h. on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in 1935 after which Blue Bird was retired. Campbell and Railton continued to work together on boats which also carried the Blue Bird name, making repeated attempts on the water speed record.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Railton had become involved in the English Racing Automobiles (ERA) project to build a single-seater racing car with Raymond Mays and Peter Berthon. Throughout 1934 Railton worked on a chassis to be manufactured by T&amp;T and fitted with a Riley Six engine modified by Mays. The ERA went on to gain a reputation as one of the quickest single-seaters of the 1930s.<br>
<br>At the same time Railton was working with another record-breaker, John Cobb. He created the Napier Railton using a Napier Lion aircraft engine on a deep underslung frame with innovative suspension to absorb the shocks of the racing track. Throughout 1933&#150;5 Cobb used the Napier Railton to break numerous records at Brooklands and on the Bonneville Salt Flats. In 1937 Cobb asked Railton to design a land-speed record car from scratch. Railton drew on all of his experience to date to create a car known simply as The Railton. It did its job and in August 1939 Cobb set a record of 369 m.p.h. He was also involved with the EX135&#151;a project started in 1937 by the MG Company. The distinctive aerodynamic shape created by Railton meant that the driving position into which the driver, Goldie Gardner, had to fit was almost horizontal. MG EX135 averaged 203 m.p.h. on the Dessau Autobahn in June 1939, the first of many successful record attempts.<br>
<br>Railton's personal appearance was at odds with his reputation. Slim with prescription sunglasses, he was a modest man who dressed without ostentation and smoked continuously. Louise Barlow, who saw him at Bonneville, described him as &#145;for all the world like a professor of dead languages at a quiet university rather than a designer of ultra-fast cars&#146;  (Ludvigsen, 20). The intense problem-solving associated with creating high-speed cars had the side-effect of causing migraine headaches and he often visited the Alps to recuperate in the mountain air.<br>
<br>In 1939 Railton accepted an invitation to join the Hall-Scott Motor Company in San Francisco and the family settled in Berkeley nearby. After a few years he decided to become an independent consultant. One of his first commissions was from his old friend John Cobb who, in September 1947, averaged 394 m.p.h. over a measured mile with the Railton Mobil Special. He too moved on to water-speed records and in 1952 Railton designed a special hull for his Crusader boat and installed a de Havilland Ghost jet engine. The boat disintegrated after reaching 200 m.p.h. and Cobb was killed. For a number of years Railton also undertook consultancy for the Hudson company of Detroit as an adviser. He died in Berkeley, California, on 1 September 1977.<br>
<br>A maverick from a non-technical family, Railton became one of the foremost engineers in his specialism. His reputation was such that the name Railton became a by-word for speed and record-breaking.<br>
