<span class="headword">Irving,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1659), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born at Tulloch in Scotland, the son of George Irving, laird of Tulloch, and his wife, Isabella Makison. In the Swedish peerage, which often lists Scottish gentry as nobility, his mother is noted as baroness of Meldrum, daughter of Bishop Alexander Makison and his wife, Christina Duncan, but no trace of this has been found in Scotland. Irving came to Sweden with his father in 1608 where the latter served as under-governor-general of Kalmar.<br>
<br>Alexander Irving soon enlisted in the Swedish army and the military archives list him as an ensign for the N&auml;rke-V&auml;rmlands regiment in 1616. He had been promoted lieutenant-captain for the Uppland regiment by 1624, though some sources say that he was still an ensign in the N&auml;rke-V&auml;rmlands regiment until 1627. This probably means that he was retained by his first regiment while serving in the second one. After becoming a lieutenant in the Uppland regiment Irving appears to have served as a captain in two other regiments from 1630, including that of Lord Donald Mackay. He was still a captain in 1632, in Duke Bernhard of Weimar's regiment. The following year he returned to the company of fellow Scots in the Green brigade as a lieutenant-colonel. In 1634 Irving held a position as major of the city militia in Regensburg, which had been occupied by the Swedes since 1633. There is further conflicting evidence as to Irving's position in 1639, both the Norrland infantry regiment and the V&auml;sterbotten regiment listing him among their officers. This implies that Irving had returned to Sweden after service in Germany, unlike many other Scottish officers who returned to Scotland during the bishops' wars.<br>
<br>At some stage Irving married Agneta Patkull, chief lady in waiting to Queen Kristina the elder. They had two sons and two daughters, which would have made leaving Sweden difficult. In 1643 Irving sought admission for his children to the Swedish house of nobility, and attention was drawn to this in the meeting of the Riksr&aring;d (Swedish state council) of 19 October. He claimed to have proof of his noble origins from Aberdeen, and he returned with the document the next day. To his dismay the Riksr&aring;d resolved that only documents from state councils, parliaments, or the monarch of a given nation would be accepted in future. Irving was still considered a nobleman, particularly on the merit of his service to the Swedish crown, but his children could not be admitted to the ranks of the Swedish nobility. The following year the Riksr&aring;d decided that Irving would receive four farms.<br>
<br>Irving's military career was still progressing and by 1645 he had been promoted colonel of the Sm&aring;land regiment. The next year he was colonel and chief of the Kalmar regiment. In 1647 Irving was ennobled in Sweden and introduced to the house of nobility. After this not much is known of him until 1654 when his military expertise led to his appointment as commandant at Stade, a Swedish fort in the former province of Bremen on the Swedish border with the Danish duchy of Holstein. Irving left the Swedish service in 1656 because of old age, and died in 1659.<br>
