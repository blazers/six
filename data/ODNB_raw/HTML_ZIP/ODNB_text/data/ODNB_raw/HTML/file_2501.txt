<span class="headword">Blackadder,  Adam</span>  (<em>b. </em>1659, <em>d.</em> in or after 1696), <span class="occ">merchant and writer on covenanting</span>, was probably born in the parish of Troqueer, near Dumfries, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2502/', "John Blackadder (1615/1623?&#150;1686)")</script>, the minister there, and his wife, Janet Haining (<i>d</i>. 1688). Among his brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2504/', "Dr William Blackadder (1647&#150;1696)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2503/', "John Blackadder (1664&#150;1729)")</script>. As his father was a prominent covenanting minister (one of Howie's &#145;Scots worthies&#146;), who was constantly harassed and pursued by the authorities, Blackadder's childhood was turbulent. In 1662 his father was expelled from his parish with the restoration of episcopacy, and the family moved to Barndennock in the parish of Glencairn. In 1666, while Blackadder's father was fortunately away, soldiers sent by the bishop of Galloway raided the family house at night, confiscating John Blackadder's books and sermons, and pillaging the house. Blackadder was forced to hold a candle to assist the men in their search. He managed to escape and fled to a nearby town, where he collapsed on a doorstep and was taken in by the owners of the house when he told them his father's name. After this the family was dispersed for safety.<br>
<br>The young Blackadder was raised to be a merchant, and is next heard of in Stirling in November 1674, when, still an apprentice, he was arrested for allegedly refusing to sign the &#145;Black bond&#146; and for attending conventicles. He was kept in prison for five weeks, after which he was released as a result of petitions to the privy council made by his elder brother, William. He was subsequently imprisoned twice more, in Fife and Blackness, in the latter place for attending his father's conventicle near Borrowstounness, Linlithgowshire, where twenty-six children were baptized.<br>
<br>About 1675 Blackadder went to Sweden, where he lived as a merchant for the next nine years. While there he married a Swedish woman, whose name is unknown, whom he converted from Lutheranism to presbyterian Calvinism. This put both Blackadder and his wife in danger, as the penalty for a Swede making such a conversion was death. The couple lived for a while under the protection of the Dutch ambassador in Stockholm; they then left for Scotland, and arrived in Dunbar in late 1684. After visiting his father, who was at that time in the Bass Rock prison, Blackadder went to Edinburgh, where he settled at the close of 1684, again as a merchant.<br>
<br>On 26 March 1696 Blackadder subscribed &pound;100 to the Darien scheme as factor for his brother Captain John Blackadder (or Blackader). He is known to have supported the Darien venture in various tracts, and he also wrote pamphlets on the political state of Scotland. He later wrote an account of his father's sufferings and his own experiences during the persecutions of the late seventeenth century, which he sent to the great Presbyterian historian Robert Wodrow. This account was subsequently used by other writers as a source for works about the persecutions, including Andrew Crichton and John Howie. Blackadder probably lived in Edinburgh for the rest of his life; the date of his death is unknown.<br>
