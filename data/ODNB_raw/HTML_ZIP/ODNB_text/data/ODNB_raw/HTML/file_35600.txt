<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Poynter, Sir  Edward John</span>, first baronet  (1836&#150;1919), <span class="occ">painter and arts administrator</span>, was born on 20 March 1836 in Paris, the second child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22687/', "Ambrose Poynter (1796&#150;1886)")</script>, an architect, and his first wife, Emma Forster (1800&#150;1848), daughter of the Revd. E. Forster; Edward's elder sister, Clara [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98433/', "Bell, Clara")</script>], became a noted translator. He came from an artistic family and many commentators subsequently emphasized the inherited nature of his ability. His father's interests extended beyond architecture to include watercolour painting and illustration. His mother was the granddaughter of the neo-classical sculptor Thomas Banks (1735&#150;1805), and both she and her mother were talented amateur artists.<h2>
<a name="EducationandtraininginParis"></a>Education and training in Paris</h2>Poynter's childhood was marked by poor health and interrupted study at Westminster School (1847&#150;9), Brighton College (1849&#150;50), and Ipswich grammar school (1851&#150;2). In 1852 he began his artistic training under the watercolourist Thomas Shotter Boys, a friend of his father; he also attended Leigh's academy. During the following year, he spent the winter in Rome where he met the painter Frederic Leighton. Inspired by the example of Leighton's large-scale academic painting, Poynter returned to London to continue his training at Leigh's and at the studio of W. C. T. Dobson. In 1855 he entered the Royal Academy Schools but a visit to the Paris Universal Exhibition in the same year convinced him of the superiority of contemporary French painting. He returned to Paris in 1856, becoming a pupil in the atelier of Charles Gleyre (1806&#150;1874) and enrolling in the &Eacute;ole des Beaux-Arts. Poynter's three-year period in Paris with fellow students James McNeill Whistler, George Du Maurier, Thomas Lamont, and Thomas Armstrong was later celebrated in Du Maurier's best-selling novel <span class="italic">Trilby</span> (1894). During this period Poynter received his first commissions for decorative work in the form of painted furniture and stained glass. He continued to design stained glass after his return to England in 1860, principally for James Powell &amp; Sons of Whitefriars glassworks. His friend the architect William Burges also employed him on several decorative projects, of which the most important were the stained glass designs for the Maison Dieu, Dover (1860&#150;1861), and the painted ceiling of Waltham Abbey, Essex (1860). Poynter also joined the ranks of the black and white illustrators of the 1860s, contributing drawings to several magazines, such as <span class="italic">Once a Week</span> and <span class="italic">London Society</span>, and executing twelve plates for the Dalziel brothers' prestigious <span class="italic">Bible Gallery</span> (eventually published in 1880).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandmarriage"></a>Early career and marriage</h2>In 1861 Poynter exhibited his first work at the Royal Academy, and during the following years he made his name with pictures of Egyptian and classical subjects. A typical example is <span class="italic">Faithful unto Death</span> (1865; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), illustrating a dramatic scene set in ancient Pompeii. He also produced paintings in watercolour, chiefly portraits and landscapes, which were regularly exhibited at the Dudley Gallery in London. In 1867 Poynter completed the large and elaborate biblical painting <span class="italic">Israel in Egypt</span> (Guildhall Art Gallery, London), which enjoyed enormous popular success and established his reputation. He followed this with <span class="italic">The Catapult</span> (1868; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne), another impressive depiction of ancient history. Both works demonstrate characteristic features of Poynter's art, such as his technical proficiency, careful attention to archaeological detail, and commitment to the academic ideal of the nude. These works ensured his election in 1869 as ARA.<br>
<br>Poynter's career as a decorative artist also flourished. Indeed, he emerges as a significant figure in the &#145;mosaic revival&#146; of the 1860s. The majority of his decorative works were commissioned by the South Kensington Museum, London. These included designs for the mosaics of <span class="italic">Phidias</span> and <span class="italic">Apelles</span> (1864) in the south court (for the series known as the <span class="roman">Kensington Valhalla</span>), the innovative tile decoration and metal grill for the grill room (or Dutch kitchen) (1866&#150;<i>c</i>.1874), and his proposed mosaic scheme for the apse of the lecture theatre (1867&#150;71). In preparation for this latter work&#151;an ambitious multifigured hemicycle&#151;Poynter travelled to Italy in 1868 to study Venetian mosaics. Unfortunately, the only part of the scheme eventually to be completed was the ornamental soffit (1877). Two further decorative projects from this period were Poynter's design for part of the frieze of the Royal Albert Hall (1869) and the cartoon for the <span class="italic">St George</span> mosaic in the houses of parliament (1869).<br>
<br>The same decade witnessed Poynter's marriage, on 9 August 1866, to Agnes [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/58272">Poynter,  Agnes</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/76071">Macdonald sisters</a>], daughter of the Revd G. B. Macdonald. Remembered as &#145;a lady of great beauty and musical talent&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>, 440), Agnes's charm was to prove a considerable social asset for her husband, whose tall and distinguished appearance was offset by a deeply reserved and forbidding manner. Agnes Poynter achieved a certain status in her own right as one of the Macdonald sisters, a title which alluded to the sisters' later fame as wives or mothers of eminent Victorians. Agnes's sisters included Louisa Baldwin (mother of Stanley Baldwin), Alice Kipling (mother of Rudyard Kipling), and Georgiana Burne-Jones (wife of Edward Burne-Jones). Edward and Agnes Poynter's eldest child, Ambrose, was born in 1867; he was followed by a second son, Hugh, in 1882.<h2>
<a name="Asanarteducator"></a>As an art educator</h2>In 1871 Poynter was appointed the first Slade professor at University College, London. During his five-year tenure he was responsible for introducing the principles of French art education into the English system. His Slade lectures upheld the continued relevance of the academic tradition, while also addressing practical issues, such as the importance of life drawing. These lectures were well received and later published under the title <span class="italic">Ten Lectures on Art</span> (1879). Poynter's promotion of his friend the French artist Alphonse Legros (1837&#150;1911) as his successor at the Slade ensured the continuation of his teaching philosophy. Poynter retired from the Slade professorship in 1875, following his appointment to the influential position of director and principal of the National Art Training School at South Kensington. In his new role administering the government art system, he again took on an agenda of reform. This included a greater emphasis on fine art training within the schools and was also reflected in his appointment of new teachers such as the French sculptor Jules Dalou (1838&#150;1902) as head of the modelling class. While at South Kensington, Poynter was responsible for the publication of a series of drawing books and several art history text books.<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>Many of the ideas which Poynter expounded in his role as an educator were evident in his major works of the 1870s. These included the fresco in St Stephen's Church, south Dulwich (1872&#150;3), depicting the trial and martyrdom of the saint. Recognized as a rare example of the <i>buon fresco</i> technique in Britain, this work's heroic figures and expressive gestures embody the principles of history painting, the most prestigious of the genres. Poynter's most important commission of the decade was the execution of four large oil paintings to decorate the billiards room at the earl of Wharncliffe's seat, Wortley Hall, near Sheffield. Between 1872 and 1879 Poynter exhibited these paintings&#151;<span class="italic">Perseus and Andromeda</span> (1872), <span class="italic">The Fight between More of More Hall and the Dragon of Wantley</span> (1873), <span class="italic">Atalanta's Race</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">Nausicaa and her Maidens Playing at Ball</span> (1879)&#151;at the Royal Academy. The last of these pictures reflects the influence of the aesthetic movement in its frieze-like composition and flowing draperies. Nevertheless, Poynter's strong emphasis on narrative and dramatic action distinguished his classical paintings from those of his contemporaries, such as Leighton and Moore. Many considered these paintings to be Poynter's greatest success as an exponent of &#145;high art&#146;; certainly they contributed to his election as RA in 1876. During the early 1880s Poynter completed the Wharncliffe commission by designing an elaborate ornamental scheme for the billiards room interior.<br>
<br>Poynter's next important work was <span class="italic">A Visit to Aesculapius</span> (1880; Tate collection), a large classical painting celebrating the female nude which was acquired by the Chantrey bequest. Between 1878 and 1884 he collaborated with Frederic Leighton on a proposal to decorate the dome of St Paul's Cathedral in mosaic. Both artists designed large cartoons illustrating an apocalyptic theme, but when viewed <i>in situ</i> these efforts were judged unsuitable and the scheme was abandoned. This project was followed by Poynter's most ambitious painting, <span class="italic">The Visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon</span> (1890; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney). A vast canvas, which included over fifty figures, this painting is reminiscent of his earlier reconstructions of antiquity, although far more grandiose in terms of technical skill and the wealth of archaeological detail. After taking over six years to complete, the work sold for &pound;3000&#151;the highest payment Poynter ever received for one of his paintings. While working on the canvas, Poynter's interest in the ancient world was reinforced by his acceptance in 1889 of the position of honorary secretary to the Society for the Preservation of the Monuments of Ancient Egypt.<br>
<br>The majority of Poynter's later works tended to be small-scale classical paintings such as <span class="italic">On the Terrace</span> (1889; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), and <span class="italic">When the World was Young</span> (1891; priv. coll.), which were frequently likened to the anecdotal, Graeco-Roman pictures of Lawrence Alma-Tadema. This predilection for classical genre was matched by an increased interest in portraiture (including some highly original portrait medallions in bronze) and landscape painting. Poynter became a regular exhibitor at the Grosvenor and New galleries and at the Society of Painters in Water Colours, sending examples in a range of media, including designs and studies. These latter works enhanced his reputation as a fine and versatile draughtsman. His interest in decorative design also continued. In 1892&#150;3 he collaborated with Alma-Tadema on a scheme of neo-Pompeian decoration for a series of rooms in the Athenaeum; the following year he created some reverses for the proposed new coinage.<h2>
<a name="AsdirectoroftheNationalGalleryandpresidentoftheRoyalAcademy"></a>As director of the National Gallery and president of the Royal Academy</h2>The 1890s saw Poynter become more actively involved in public office. In 1894 he was the last practising artist to be appointed director of the National Gallery, London. In spite of legislative changes which had curtailed the director's discretionary powers, Poynter still made a valuable contribution to the collection. His most notable acquisitions included Pisanello's <span class="italic">The Vision of St Eustace</span>, Antonello's <span class="italic">St Jerome in his Study</span>, Mantegna's <span class="italic">Agony in the Garden</span>, Titian's <span class="italic">Portrait of a Man</span>, and Rembrandt's portraits of Jacob Trip and his wife. Moreover, his unusual breadth of taste resulted in the gallery purchasing works by Lorenzo Monaco, D&uuml;rer (ascribed), Zurbaran, Jan Steen, Goya, and Alfred Stevens. Before his retirement in 1904, Poynter edited the first complete illustrated catalogue of the collection (1899) and was responsible for the display and opening of the Tate Gallery in 1897.<br>
<br>In recognition of his experience and talents as an artist, educator, and administrator, Poynter was elected president of the Royal Academy in December 1896, following the death of Millais; in the same year he was knighted, becoming a baronet in 1902. During his presidency the academy was increasingly challenged by more progressive elements in the arts community. This is reflected, for example, by the appointment in 1904 of a select committee to inquire into the academy's administration of the Chantrey Fund. Poynter remained in office for twenty-two years, until ill health and failing eyesight led to his reluctant resignation in 1918. In the same year, his fine collection of old master drawings was sold at Sothebys on 24&#150;5 April 1918. Poynter died on 26 July 1919 at his house and studio, at 70 Addison Road, Kensington, and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 30 July. His studio sale was held at Christies on 19 January 1920.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Poynter was unfortunate in outliving most of his generation, for he became a target of the modernists in their rejection of Victorian art. His reputation as a teacher and academic draughtsman, however, did survive into the twentieth century: William Gaunt described him as &#145;one of the best draughtsmen of his age&#146;  (Gaunt, 16). It was not until the revival of interest in Victorian art during the 1970s that Poynter's role as a leading figure of the English classical revival was again recognized. Recent scholarship has continued to focus on aspects of Poynter's classicism, such as his assimilation of contemporary developments in archaeology or his advocacy of the nude. This emphasis on Poynter as a &#145;Victorian Olympian&#146; has tended to obscure his equally important activities as a decorative artist and public official. It should not be forgotten that during his lengthy career&#151;which extended over sixty years&#151;Poynter achieved distinction not only as a painter in oil and watercolour, but also as an academic draughtsman, a decorative designer in stained glass, mosaic, fresco, and ceramic tiles, a modeller of medals and coinage, an etcher, a graphic illustrator, a portrait painter, and a theatre designer. He also added the roles of educator, administrator, and museum official to his many achievements. He deserves recognition as one of the great Victorian polymaths. Poynter's works are held in most major British collections, including the Tate collection, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Manchester City Galleries, and the British Library. He is also represented in many Commonwealth art collections.<br>
