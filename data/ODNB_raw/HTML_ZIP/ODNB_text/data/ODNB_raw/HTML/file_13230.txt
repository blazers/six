<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Higgins,  Francis</span>  (1669/70&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was one of at least eleven children of Robert Higgins, a Limerick apothecary. Although, according to Higgins, the family's &#145;little fortune&#146; was &#145;ruined&#146; in the Williamite wars his brother John (also an apothecary) eventually became an alderman of the city. After education at Mr Ryland's school in Limerick Francis entered Trinity College, Dublin, aged sixteen, in May 1686, as a sizar. Ordained in 1689, while an undergraduate, the college being then under military occupation, Higgins was made curate of St Andrew's, Dublin, and was (or so he said) imprisoned by the Jacobite authorities. In February 1690 he became a reader at Christ Church Cathedral, only to be suspended shortly afterwards for dereliction of duty. He took his BA in 1691 and his MA two years later.<br>
<br>In 1694 Higgins was presented to the rectory of Gowran, co. Kilkenny, by the Jacobite Lord Rosse. He later claimed to have been employed as an agent by the &#145;lower clergy&#146; against a bill introduced during the Irish parliamentary session of 1695&#150;7. Otherwise he first came to public notice in the Irish convocation summoned in 1704. A proctor for the diocese of Ossory, he was one of the prominent high-churchmen who, according to Archbishop King of Dublin, &#145;got the management of the clergy &hellip; into their hands&#146;  (King to Archbishop Wake, 12 Sept 1717, Wake MSS). With his clerical friend William Perceval he frequented the Swan Tripe Club, a tory dining club in Dublin which was the target of a satire depicting Higgins as fat, red-faced, and loquacious: &#145;a son of pudding and eternal beef&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Swan Tripe-Club</span>, 1705). His former negligence forgotten, the high-flying canons of Christ Church elected Higgins to a prebend in 1705 and promptly dispatched him to England to pursue their jurisdictional dispute with Archbishop King. Higgins had already acquired a reputation as a fiery preacher, which he enhanced while in England, his partisan enthusiasm reaching a climax in a sermon preached in the Chapel Royal on Ash Wednesday (26 February) 1707, which was so strident in its denunciation of whigs as enemies of the monarchy and the established church that he was arrested for preaching sedition. Although the government entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i>, not only the offending sermon was published but also a &#145;postscript&#146; (attributed to the nonjuror Charles Leslie), with an account of a prior interview with Archbishop Tenison of Canterbury, in which Tenison's advice to Higgins to moderate his tone had been insolently rejected. By order of the Irish House of Lords the postscript was publicly burnt. Higgins and Perceval also ran into controversy when they testified before the convocation of Canterbury to the powers of the lower house of convocation in Dublin. Although condemned in print for acting without authority the two men were vindicated by the Irish convocation.<br>
<br>Higgins returned to Ireland in 1710 to spearhead the clerical reaction that accompanied the re-establishment of a tory ministry. He involved himself in a series of political disputes, in the most remarkable of which he supported fantastic allegations made by a converted Catholic priest, Dominic Langton, of an alleged republican conspiracy among provincial whigs. Unpleasant scenes followed at the Dublin quarter sessions, which Higgins attended as a JP (he had been removed in 1709 but was later restored). After he had insisted that the assembled company at the justices' dinner drink to the principle of passive obedience the grand jury presented him as &#145;a common disturber of her Majesty's peace&#146;. The foreman, Lord Santry, brought this charge before the Irish privy council but was rebuffed by the tory majority there. Higgins was now the centre of attention on both sides of the Irish sea and became known as &#145;the Irish Sacheverell&#146;. In 1712 he once again arrived in London: &#145;I believe&#146;, wrote Swift, &#145;he designs to make as much noise as he can in order to preferment&#146;  (Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, 2.536). He was talked of for a deanery, in Ireland or England, but nothing came his way.<br>
<br>After the Hanoverian succession, although still a thorn in Archbishop King's flesh, Higgins seems to have avoided political controversy. Belatedly he acquired the archdeaconry of Cashel, in 1725, in succession to Perceval, but he may have been an absentee for he retained the Christ Church prebend. He died in August 1728 and was buried in his prebendal church, St Michael and All Angels, Dublin. He is not known to have married. Besides several anonymous squibs, which may possibly be attributed to him, he published five sermons, all delivered between 1705 and 1707.<br>
