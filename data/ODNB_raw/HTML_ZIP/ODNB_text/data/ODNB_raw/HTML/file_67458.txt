<span class="headword">Postgate,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1596&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born at Ugglebarnby, near Whitby, to James Postgate, a prosperous farmer, and his wife, Margery (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson), who were reported as recusants in 1604 when it was claimed that they had married clandestinely and had their children baptized in secret. He may have been the youth of that name who was part of a troupe of travelling players, based at Egton on the North York Moors, who performed in the houses of Catholic gentry over a wide area of Yorkshire and were prosecuted at quarter sessions in 1615. On 4 July 1621 he entered the English College at Douai in company with other candidates from Yorkshire, receiving minor orders in 1627 and being ordained priest by the archbishop of Arras on 20 March 1628. He left for the English mission in 1630, arriving at Whitby on 29 June, and thereafter spent over thirty years as domestic chaplain in successive gentry households in Yorkshire, first with Lady Hungate at Saxton Hall, until her death in 1642, and then with the dowager Viscountess Dunbar at Halsham until 1659. On her death he moved to Everingham, to a junior branch of the Constable family, and from there also served at North Kilvington, where the Meynell family resided. If this career looks like one of retirement in comfortable gentry households, then a letter of Postgate written to George Leyburn at Douai in 1664 dispels that impression: in that letter he describes the achievements of his ministry since 1630, in which he claimed to have married 226 couples, baptized 593 infants, buried 719 co-religionists, and reconciled 2400 to the church. He also claimed to have currently 600 penitents, and could have had more. This letter was written shortly after his ministry took a new direction with his return to the North York Moors, where he lived in a farmhouse on the moors and ministered to the well-established recusant farming communities at Egton and Ugthorpe. During his time there the Catholic community increased in numbers, comprising over one-third of the adult population in 1676. His ministry was cut short by the hysteria surrounding the alleged Popish Plot, and he was arrested on 7 December 1678 while baptizing a child of one of his congregation. On arrest he gave his mother's name of Watson, only one of the aliases he used, the others being variants of Whitemoor, and was brought before the justices at Thirsk. He was eventually tried in York in March 1679 and convicted of being a priest. During his detention in York Castle over the summer months he was given free access to visitors, and tradition recalls that it was in prison that he wrote the hymn which is still sung among Roman Catholics of the region. He was executed on 7 August 1679 on the Knavesmire at York, and a cult quickly established itself, being given literary currency through Thomas Wood's satiric poem &#145;England's reformation&#146;, which attacked the extremes of the Popish Plot and created the image of &#145;Father Postgate&#146;. Postgate was beatified in 1886 and an annual rally of the Roman Catholic diocese of Middlesbrough continues to meet in his honour at his old mission at Egton Bridge on the first Sunday of July.<br>
