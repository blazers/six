<span class="headword">Cust,  Robert Needham</span>  (1821&#150;1909), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and orientalist</span>, was born at Cockayne Hatley, Bedfordshire, on 24 February 1821, the second son of Henry Cockayne Cust (1780&#150;1861), canon of Windsor, and his wife, Lady Anna Maria Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1866), eldest daughter of Francis Needham, first earl of Kilmorey. His father was the second son of Brownlow Cust, first Baron Brownlow (1744&#150;1807).<br>
<br>Cust was educated at the Revd H. Burn's school in Mitcham, Surrey (1830&#150;33), Eton College (1834&#150;40), and the East India Company's college at Haileybury (1840&#150;42), where he distinguished himself in Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and Hindustani. In 1844 he was posted to Ambala as assistant to the governor-general's agent for the north-western frontier, Major George Broadfoot, and temporarily took charge as agent when Broadfoot was killed in action at Ferozeshahr in December 1845. In 1846 he was appointed deputy commissioner of Hoshiarpur and under the guidance of John Lawrence enthusiastically implemented the paternalistic, &#145;non-regulation&#146; style of government that became the hallmark of the Punjab administration. In November 1849 he was transferred back to his old district of Ambala.<br>
<br>In May 1852, after eighteen months' furlough, Cust was appointed officiating joint magistrate of Benares and three months later became officiating magistrate of Banda. In March 1855 he returned to England to study for the bar and while there married, on 10 May 1856, Maria Adelaide (<i>d</i>. 1864), second daughter of Henry Lewis Hobart, dean of Windsor, with whom he had two sons and three daughters. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in August 1857 and returned to India in February 1858, whereupon he was appointed commissioner of Lahore. Subsequently he acted as financial commissioner of the Punjab and in 1861 as judicial commissioner. At Lahore he was remembered by his subordinate officers as a stickler for the rules and a great talker, but gloomy and prone to moralizing.<br>
<br>On 17 January 1864 Maria died, seven days after giving birth to their third daughter. Cust, who was devastated by her death, went home to England to settle the children, and upon his return in October became acting home secretary to the government of India (1864&#150;5). On 28 December 1865 he married Emma, eldest daughter of Edward Carlyon, rector of Debden, Hampshire, and shortly afterwards took up a seat on the board of revenue in the North-Western Provinces. Unhappily, in August 1867 Emma too died in childbirth, whereupon Cust quit India immediately, just nine months short of qualifying for his pension.<br>
<br>Back in England he recovered his energy and spirit, and on 11 November 1868 he married Elizabeth Dewar (<i>d</i>. 1910), only daughter of J. Mathews. In 1867&#150;8, at the prompting of his old boss John Lawrence, now viceroy, he drafted a code of revenue law for northern India, but this was his last official undertaking. Independently wealthy, he devoted his remaining years to oriental philology and religion, travelling throughout Europe, north Africa, and Asia and attending numerous international congresses. He was a prominent member of many literary societies and of the Royal Geographical Society, and from 1878 until 1899 served as honorary secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society. Inexhaustibly prolific, between 1870 and 1909 he published more than sixty volumes, all of which he financed himself, and hundreds of articles and reviews. Chief among his works are <span class="italic">Modern Languages of the East Indies</span> (1878), <span class="italic">Modern Languages of Africa</span> (1883), <span class="italic">Oceania</span> (1887), <span class="italic">The Caucasian Group</span> (1887), and a seven-part series, <span class="roman">Linguistic and Oriental Essays</span> (1880&#150;1904). Even at the time, however, Cust's scholarship was regarded as intelligent rather than profound and it is actually his diaries and letters, with their unique portrayal of Victorian sensibility in India, which have proved to be the most durable of his writings.<br>
<br>Cust was a devout, evangelizing Christian, but he rejected literal interpretations of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and prided himself on a scientific understanding of the development of different religions. He served on the committees of the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, as well as supporting numerous philanthropic ventures. In 1899 he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Life Memoir, 1821&#150;1899</span>. He died on 28 October 1909 at his residence, 49 Campden Hill Road, Kensington, and was buried at Putney Vale. His wife, Elizabeth, died six months later. He was survived by their only child, Anna Maria Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1870), and three children of his first marriage: Albinia Lucy (1857&#150;1929), Robert Henry Hobart (1861&#150;1940), a Renaissance art specialist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49431/', "Maria Eleanor Vere Cust (1862/3&#150;1958)")</script>, a geographer.<br>
