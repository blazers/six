<span class="headword">Bagwell,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1593, <em>d.</em> in or after 1664), <span class="occ">merchant and writer on astronomy</span>, was, according to his own account, &#145;bred a merchant in good quality, skilfully furnished with knowledge in all things necessary, and having seen the world abroad&#146;  (Bagwell, <span class="italic">Mystery</span>, introduction). For several years he had carried on an extensive trade, when losses overseas led to his being sent to prison for debt. By 1654 he had been in and out of prison for twenty years. He relieved the tedium of imprisonment by writing &#145;An arithmetical description of the celestial and terrestrial globes&#146;  (BL, Sloane MSS 652, fols. 141&#150;4), a treatise which he did not publish, believing it to be too abstruse for general use but nevertheless worthy to be placed in a university. After being set at liberty and found employment by some friends he published a simplified version of this treatise as <span class="italic">The Mystery of Astronomy Made Plain to the Meanest Capacity</span> (1655). This work is a natural philosophical text concerning geography, topography, and astronomy, which is mainly of interest in propounding the Aristotelian view of the universe at a relatively late date.<br>
<br>Bagwell was so affected by the discipline of his confinement that he published, in poetical form, <span class="italic">The Distressed Merchant, and Prisoner's Comfort</span> (1645); this was caricatured by the royalist Edmund Gayton in his <span class="italic">Wil Bagnal's ghost, or, The merry devill of Gadmunton in his perambulations of the prisons of London</span> (1655), and also in &#145;Wil Bagnalls Ballet&#146; included in the collection entitled <span class="italic">Wit Restor'd</span> (1658). In 1660 Bagwell published another short poem, <span class="italic">An Affectionate Expostulation for the Pious Employment both of Wit and Wealth</span>. He is last heard of in 1664 when his collection of riddles and aphorisms entitled <span class="italic">Wit's Extraction</span> was published. This contains his portrait, engraved in 1659 and with an inscription giving his age as sixty-six.<br>
<br>Bagwell's name appears to be associated with <span class="italic">A concealement discovered for the publique advantage &hellip; the effect of a petition directed to the &hellip; Councell of State for the Common-wealth of England, by Will. Bagnell and John Brockendon, discoverers and plaintiffs in the behalf of the said Common-wealth</span> (1652), but it is possible that this William Bagnell was another person.<br>
