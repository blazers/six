<span class="headword">Yerkes,  Charles Tyson</span>  (1837&#150;1905), <span class="occ">financier of urban transport systems</span>, was born on 28 June 1837 at Philadelphia, son of Charles Tyson Yerkes, who became president of a local bank, and his wife, Elizabeth Link, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broom. A Quaker by upbringing, he left the Central High School, Philadelphia, at seventeen, and soon gained a good reputation as an investor of other people's money, due in no small part to his abilities on the local stock exchange. He made a small fortune by the age of thirty, lost it when, overextended, he was unable to meet his commitments in the panic of 1871, served a short prison sentence, and then made another quick fortune. He married Susanna Guttridge Gamble on 22 December 1862. She subsequently divorced him. He then married, on 23 September 1881, Mary Adelaide Moore.<br>
<br>Earlier writers have dwelt upon Yerkes's sharp financial practices and loose private morals, but more recent critics prefer to concentrate upon his achievements in developing urban transport in the rapidly growing city of Chicago, after moving there in 1881. America took the world lead in the great technical changes in urban transport in and after the later 1880s, and Yerkes, who mastered all the money-raising, cost, and other problems involved, made much money for himself, and his business associates. This, however, did not endear him to the travelling public, other residents, or the local press, who were usually hostile to the newcomer, despite his contribution to their city. He sold out very advantageously at the end of the century.<br>
<br>While in Chicago, Yerkes had been keeping an eye on developments in Europe. He paid visits to London and learned of plans to electrify the existing steam-operated underground and horse-drawn tramways. Electric traction also made possible the operation of railways in tubes, driven easily through the London clay. Yerkes was almost certainly the &#145;typical Yankee&#146;, whom Henrietta Barnett recalled meeting in 1896, who kept talking about &#145;a proposal &hellip; to convey all London about in tunnels&#146;. He certainly came to inspect the steam-operated Metropolitan District Railway, part of the existing underground, in 1898. It is not known when he and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36215/', "Edgar Speyer")</script>, head of the London section of an international banking concern, which also had a branch in New York, were first in touch with each other. The house of Speyer was heavily involved in railway investment in general, and the electrification of the Metropolitan District in particular. Electric traction was slow to be adopted in London because the first stretch of electric tube, the City and South London (1890), paid all the penalties of the pioneer. It was built too small, and produced poor financial results. The Central London Railway, however, opened from Shepherd's Bush under the busy road leading to the City, benefited from earlier experience, and was an instant success. It started to run in June 1900. By October of that year the world's leading expert on the financing, route planning, and day-to-day operation of urban railways had arrived in London, though whether on his own initiative, or summoned by friends, is unknown.<br>
<br>One of Yerkes's associates was Robert William Perks, formerly solicitor for the Metropolitan Railway (the other part of the existing steam underground), who had unrivalled knowledge of parliamentary procedure, and other relevant legal matters. Yerkes, Perks, and Speyer formed a powerful trio to bring to life various tube proposals which had gained parliamentary sanction, and another tube, partly built but abandoned because of the failure of its promoters. Yerkes lost no time in setting up a traction company, capitalized at &pound;1 million, to electrify the Metropolitan District, and then turned his attention to the tubes. The traction company acquired the partly built Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, on which &pound;675,000 had been spent, for &pound;180,000. Having studied the capital's main traffic flows along routes for which tubes had been authorized, Yerkes abandoned a proposal to build the line under the Metropolitan District (intended to provide an express service into the City), and diverted it, using other franchises, from South Kensington via Piccadilly Circus to Finsbury Park. He secured additional parliamentary powers to extent a third tube, already authorized from Charing Cross to Hampstead, to a surface terminus at Golders Green, encouraging suburban growth in that area, especially in what became Henrietta Barnett's planned Hampstead Garden Suburb. He secured further powers for a branch from Camden Town to Archway. All these proposals involved greatly increasing the traction company's &pound;1 million. Underground Electric Railways of London Ltd (UERL), capitalized at &pound;5 million, was therefore floated in 1902 to operate the whole undertaking as a network which, as Yerkes (who became its chairman) claimed, could not but be profitable. Much more capital was needed and all Yerkes's skills in manipulating commercial paper&#151;including the issuing of profit-sharing notes&#151;were called for. The British were relatively unresponsive, for construction costs, as usual, exceeded budget and traffic predictions remained uncertain. Foreign investors, and especially Americans, however, believed Yerkes's sanguine forecasts. The necessary capital, about &pound;15 million in all, was forthcoming, some of it in the end still unallocated by Speyer Brothers. Electric trains began to run on the Metropolitan District from July 1905, and the three tubes were opened between March 1906 and June 1907. Londoners benefited enormously, but at the expense of the investors, for the forecast revenues were not forthcoming. UERL had the greatest difficulty in surviving.<br>
<br>Yerkes, however, did not live to see this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. He died at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York (not at his own home in 5th Avenue where his wife lived) on 29 December 1905, the cause of death being said to be Bright's disease. His personal fortune suffered with the rest and his valuable art collection had subsequently to be sold by auction. &#145;This is one of the ordinary hazards of the modern world&#146; commented his obituary writer, &#145;in which speculators make money, buy art treasures lavishly, and die in debt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Dec 1905).<br>
