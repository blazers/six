<span class="headword">Badmin,  Stanley Roy</span>  (1906&#150;1989), <span class="occ">illustrator, painter, and printmaker</span>, was born at 8A Niederwald Road, Sydenham, London, on 18 April 1906, the second child of Charles James Badmin, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Margaret (Madge) Raine, both of whom had come from Somerset. Important in his development into the essential illustrator of the English countryside were family holidays to Holcombe, in the Mendips, staying with his paternal grandfather, the village carpenter; these trips continued long after his grandfather's death, into adulthood and married life. Badmin was educated at Sydenham School, and continued to receive general private tuition on becoming an art student, for in 1922 he won a scholarship to Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, and studied under Cosmo Clarke and Thomas Derrick. Then, in 1924, he won a studentship to the Royal College of Art, London (RCA), switching in his second year from painting to design; following the change he encountered such important teachers as Professor Tristram and Randolph Schwabe, the latter remaining a close friend. A precocious and conscientious student with a specialism in book illustration, he received his diploma in 1927.<br>
<br>In the following year Badmin prepared for an art teacher's diploma, taking a range of courses at the RCA and at Camberwell. Thus he could supplement his income early in his career by teaching at Richmond School of Art (1934) and St John's Wood School of Art (1936), experiences that sealed his friendship with colleague P. F. Millard. Nevertheless he quickly established himself, first as an illustrator and then as an etcher. He made his initial periodical contributions to <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> (1928), and had his inaugural solo show at the Twenty-One Gallery, London, in 1930. He married Margaret Georgina (Peggy) Colborne in the same year. Badmin had been introduced to the gallery in 1928 by Robert Sargent Austin, his etching tutor at the RCA. It published many of his masterly etchings during the few years until 1931, when the market in the medium slumped. He then transferred to the Fine Art Society and concentrated increasingly on watercolour while continuing to etch and maintaining an emphasis on rich, evocative topography. Election to the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (associate, 1931; member, 1935) was soon followed&#151;and superseded&#151;by election to the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours (associate, 1932; member, 1939). A wider reputation was ensured in 1935, when Badmin received a major commission from <span class="italic">Fortune</span>, an American magazine, which asked him to depict various towns in the United States; the results were exhibited at MacDonald's Gallery, New York (1936). A growing international perspective also led to greater political awareness, the events of the Spanish Civil War encouraging him to join James Holland and others of the liberal left in the Artists' International Association. Maintaining his ideals beyond the Second World War, he became an active member of the Sydenham and Forest Hill Peace Group.<br>
<br>An important development in Badmin's illustrative style was marked by <span class="italic">Highways and Byways of Essex</span> (1938). Begun by F. L. M. Griggs, an artist revered for his prints and illustrations, it was completed by Badmin following Griggs's death. His meticulous use of pen and ink capitalized on his earlier etchings and offered lively anecdote in contrast to Griggs's sombre majesty. A unique eye for detail soon enabled him to make a mark as an important educational illustrator; his first Puffin picture book, <span class="italic">Village and Town</span> (1939), lithographed in colour, was followed by <span class="italic">Trees in Britain</span> (1942), through which Badmin's name became a byword for the accurate depiction of trees. He made a similarly distinctive contribution to a project aimed at adults, &#145;Recording Britain&#146; (1940), in which artists were paid by the Pilgrim Trust to record threatened buildings and landscapes; fifteen of his drawings were included in the resulting three-volume publication, <span class="italic">Recording Britain</span> (1946&#150;7). The Second World War emphasized the urgency of such an occupation, while also employing Badmin in other ways. He contributed drawings to exhibitions organized by the Ministry of Information and, following his call-up in 1942, worked on operational model-making at RAF Medmenham, near Henley-on-Thames. In its vision of a peaceful, profitable Britain, Badmin's art seemed to offer a perfect antidote to war and an ideal for the post-war generation. It received unparalleled popular exposure from 1948, when he joined the agency of Saxon Artists and took on frequent commercial commissions. He designed series of advertisements for Fisons and Bowater Paper, and produced posters for transport and travel companies. He was also patronized by Royle, one of the largest manufacturers of greetings cards and calendars. Equally in demand as an illustrator of books and periodicals, he published <span class="italic">Trees for Town and Country</span> (1947) and <span class="italic">British Countryside in Colour</span> (1951), and contributed to <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>. His constant professionalism and stamina became particularly useful from 24 March 1950, when, his first marriage having ended in divorce, he married Rosaline Elizabeth Wates Flew, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Downey, and took on the upbringing of her daughter, Elizabeth, along with that of his own two children, Patrick and Joanna; a fourth child, Galea, was born in 1951.<br>
<br>Only from the mid-1950s was Badmin able to paint two or three major pieces for each Royal Watercolour Society exhibition and hold a show at the Leicester Galleries (1955). He also found time to embark on projects for Shell, perhaps the most important commercial patron of British art; his contribution to Geoffrey Grigson's <span class="italic">Shell Guide to Trees and Shrubs</span> (1958) and four volumes of <span class="roman">Shell Guides</span> to the counties greatly influenced and enhanced the house style.<br>
<br>In 1959 Badmin and his family moved to Bignor, near Pulborough, Sussex, from where he continued to paint and exhibit. He held a further show, at Worthing Art Gallery in 1967. In 1984 the Royal Watercolour Society honoured his achievement by devoting a part of its autumn exhibition to his work. This was followed in 1985 by a major retrospective at Chris Beetles Gallery and an accompanying monograph. The overwhelming success of that show proved the artist's enduring appeal and value as an interpreter and chronicler of the native landscape. He died in his beloved Sussex, at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, on 28 April 1989.<br>
