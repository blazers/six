<span class="headword">Haig,  Edward <span class="st"> [Ned]</span></span>  (1858&#150;1939), <span class="occ">rugby player</span>, was born at Pleasants in the Scottish borders town of Jedburgh on 7 December 1858, the fifth son of Edward Haig (<i>b</i>. 1812/13), labourer, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Waugh (<i>b</i>. 1814/15). He attended Jedburgh grammar school (1870&#150;75) before going to find work in the neighbouring town of Melrose, where he was taken on by the local butcher Davie Sanderson. Sanderson was a keen rugby player and through him Haig took up the game, making his d&eacute;but for the Melrose club in 1880. He went on to become a regular member of the Melrose first fifteen and made several representative appearances for the South of Scotland. In addition, he was a member of the local cricket, curling, and golf clubs. When his playing career ended he became an active committee man.<br>
<br>Ned Haig is remembered as the originator of seven-a-side rugby. His suggestion of a football tournament was made in 1883, when Melrose Football Club were trying to find a way to raise money to help club finances. He later recalled that &#145;as it was hopeless to think of having several games in one afternoon with fifteen players on each side, the teams were reduced to seven men&#146;  (Allan, 20). The first final, held on 28 April 1883, was contested between Melrose and Galashiels, with Haig in the Melrose starting line-up. This ended in a highly controversial manner when the game ended with neither team having scored. It was agreed by the captains that a further fifteen minutes would be played to decide the tie. Melrose were first to score, with a try by Haig's employer, Sanderson, and left the field claiming the silver cup presented by &#145;the ladies of Melrose&#146;. The tournament was an immediate commercial success and has been held ever since, with interruptions during the world wars, though the nature of the competition and the prizes awarded were regarded with some suspicion in the early years by rugby's governing body in Scotland, the Scottish Football Union. Sevens rugby has spread round the world, with competitions held at Buenos Aires since 1921, Twickenham (the Middlesex sevens) since 1927, and Hong Kong since 1968.<br>
<br>Haig, who was unmarried, spent his last years in Dingleton Hospital, Melrose, suffering from mental illness, and died there on 29 March 1939. The border rugby clubs erected a tombstone to commemorate the most famous Scot, with the exception of Robert the Bruce, to be buried in Melrose. At the Greenyards, home of Melrose Rugby Football Club, stands the impressive Ned Haig bar behind the grandstand, where supporters from all over the world gather annually on the second Saturday of April to watch the game of seven-a-side rugby.<br>
