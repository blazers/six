<span class="headword">Hammond,  Robert</span>  (1850&#150;1915), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 19 January 1850 at Park Lane, Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, the son of Robert Hammond, brewer, and his wife, Ann. He was educated at Nunhead grammar school. His first job was in the counting-house of a London cloth merchant, but in 1866 he joined the engineering firm Ullathorne &amp; Co. of Lincoln's Inn Fields. In 1872 he left Ullathorne's for Bryant, Forster &amp; Co., iron merchants, in Newcastle upon Tyne. After a short period with another iron merchant, James Jennings, he established his first engineering company, the partnership of Hammond, Kyle &amp; Co., but this was ruined by a crash in South American securities.<br>
<br>Hammond first became involved in electrical engineering in 1878, when he took it up alongside his continuing iron ore interests. His first lighting installations were of arc lamps, illuminating various iron companies' works in the north east. He soon turned to public and municipal lighting, and was involved in some of the earliest public schemes, including those at Chesterfield and Brighton in 1881, and Hastings and Eastbourne in 1882. He also helped to fund Sebastian de Ferranti's early work on dynamos. A tireless worker, Hammond was responsible for dozens of public lighting installations, as well as several for heavy industry, and schemes in Ireland and Spain. He also set up several &#145;house-to-house&#146; companies for public electricity supply. However, he often faced financial difficulties, and in 1893 he gave up contracting engineering to concentrate on consulting and expert witness work.<br>
<br>Elected a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) in 1893, Hammond became honorary treasurer in 1902. He was able to apply his varied experiences to bring in reforms that strengthened the IEE's position in relation to the electrical industry. He introduced the IEE's model forms of contract in 1903, which brought a much needed element of standardization to electrical contracting. He was also responsible for introducing the IEE's membership examinations. A colleague said of him that it was just as well that Hammond's engineering knowledge was not subjected to the tests he had introduced. Despite his lack of formal training, he realized that structured, practical training courses were essential to the future of the electrical industry, and to this end he helped to establish one of the first technical colleges, Faraday House, in 1889, after an earlier attempt to found a college in 1883 had failed.<br>
<br>Hammond's capacity for work was almost endless. As a result of touring the country delivering popular lectures on lighting developments, he wrote one of the first popular handbooks on electric light, <span class="italic">The Electric Light in our Homes</span>, published in 1884. In 1891 he launched a journal, <span class="italic">Lightning</span>, which aimed to provide information about the electricity industry for users and customers. <span class="italic">Lightning</span> later became the <span class="italic">Electrical Times</span>. However, his energy extended beyond the electricity industry. In 1889 he unsuccessfully ran as an MP for the Hallam division of Sheffield, standing as a Liberal free-trader. He was a keen golfer, and wrote two books on bridge and one on whist. He also loved travel, and often combined this with his work, visiting the USA several times to study electric traction systems, and presenting an influential paper in South Africa about electricity development in the Rand. His only son, Robert Whitehead Hammond, born in 1876 from his first marriage, to Elizabeth Whitehead, and also an electrical engineer, was due to take over his father's business, but was killed in the trenches in 1917. His first wife having died, Robert Hammond contracted a second marriage in 1914, to Martha Winifred (<i>b</i>. 1876), daughter of Joseph Edwards. Hammond died at his home, 1 Rudall Crescent, Hampstead, on 5 August 1915, and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
