<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  George Malcolm</span>  (1882&#150;1959), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Charlton, Kent, on 29 April 1882, the only son of George Frederick Young, waterman, later a steamer master, of Greenhithe, and his wife, Rosetta Jane Elizabeth Ross. A scholar of St Paul's School, he became captain of the school. A scholar of Balliol College, Oxford, in the year (1900) in which William Temple was elected to an exhibition, Young gained a first in classical honour moderations (1902) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1904), having rowed in the second torpid. He was elected a fellow of All Souls in 1905 and became a tutor at St John's College (1906&#150;8). In 1908 he joined the Board of Education, then under the sway of Sir Robert Morant, to whom he remained devoted. Young became a junior examiner in the universities branch; then, in 1911, the first secretary of what was to burgeon into the University Grants Committee. In 1916 he joined the newly formed cabinet office. Appointed CB in 1917, he was chosen as joint secretary of the new and short-lived Ministry of Reconstruction. He accompanied Arthur Henderson, then a member of the war cabinet, as secretary on his notorious visit to Russia in 1917, where Young met Francis Lindley, at that time counsellor in the British embassy. He went with Lindley to Archangel and later accompanied him to Vienna when Lindley went there as minister. In Vienna, Young was for a time a director of the newly founded Anglo-Austrian Bank: &#145;a curious anaemic-looking man&#146;, not mixing readily but already recognized by his younger British colleagues as &#145;a great scholar with a wide range of knowledge and a wonderful command of the English language&#146;.<br>
<br>Abandoning the public service in the early post-war disillusion, Young decided to devote himself to writing, but nothing could remove that intense interest in education which shone throughout all his work. He was at heart a born teacher, thirsting to impart the results of his own sharp and constructive thoughts bred of a wide and deep reading in a formidable variety of subjects. Yet he was in no hurry. Although his essay &#145;Victorian history&#146; had caught discerning eyes in 1931, it was not until he was fifty that he published his first book, <span class="italic">Gibbon</span> (1932), a work of <i>pietas</i> but inspired also by a desire to impress upon the new biographers that neither Freud nor Marx had yet explained why there should be great men. He noted in Gibbon that &#145;sense of place&#146; which he himself displayed. He made his home in Wiltshire where at the Old Oxyard at Oare near Marlborough he fell upon the antiquities of Wessex, not forgetting &#145;pond barrows&#146;, with far more knowledge and no less eagerness than his favourite John Aubrey had done. He shared house with his lifelong friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70137/', "Mona Wilson (1872&#150;1954)")</script>, the civil servant and author; there she took charge of all those details of everyday life in which Young himself was oddly helpless and dependent. Surrounded in this neighbourhood by many cronies, including a bevy of former ambassadors, Young became, alongside Miss Wilson with her short fireside pipe, the centre of intellectual gossip and a dispenser of fascinating talk drawn from the resources of an astonishing memory. Urban in origin and urbane by disposition he was no less at home with countrymen and the railway workers of Swindon. He took pleasure in finding himself a tory and &#145;no Tory of whatever rank or class ever thought of a merely moneyed man as his social equal&#146;.<br>
<br>At the perceptive invitation of Oxford University Press, no doubt at the instigation of Humphrey Milford, Young edited the two volumes of <span class="italic">Early Victorian England</span> which appeared in 1934 and to which he himself contributed that final summary chapter which brought his especial quality to the attention of a wider and delighted public; this essay he developed into <span class="italic">Victorian England: Portrait of an Age</span> (1936), by which he will be remembered. What was important in history was, in his view, &#145;not what happened, but what people felt about it when it was happening&#146;. Young had the industry, the learning, the memory, and above all the penetration to disentangle the main themes from the confused Victorian clamour. His advice to the historian was &#145;to go on reading until you can hear people talking&#146;. He did not add that an interpreter of his talent, erudition, and perception&#151;or with the gifts of his revered F. W. Maitland&#151;might still be needed. Embedded in Young's writing was more food for thought than the common reader had been accustomed to encounter. Nor was his aim objective; even in narrative he would not forgo comment, with an epithet, an adverb, a tone of voice. His Clio was a muse with a sting.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">Charles I and Cromwell</span> (1935), an essay in detection published before his developed Victorian masterpiece, came <span class="italic">Daylight and Champaign</span> (1937), a collection of essays and reviews&#151;many of them reprinted from the literary periodicals such as the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, to which Young was by now a valued contributor. There, and in other reprints, which included addresses such as his Romanes lecture on Gladstone in 1944, in his <span class="italic">Today and Yesterday</span> (1948) and in <span class="italic">Last Essays</span> (1950), he found elbow-room for good talk, addressed purposely to the middlebrow, about literature, persons, and manners. Unbuttoned, he might be colloquial, give full play to his humour, even show off a little since he was enjoying himself, yet literature remained a very serious matter for him, as were the duties of the clerisy and the continuity of civilization. He was deeply concerned with language as a means of communication; good speech he deemed &#145;the first political art&#146;. A university he regarded as &#145;a place where young men and women educate one another by conversation, under the guidance of people a little older, and, more often than they might imagine, somewhat wiser than themselves&#146;.<br>
<br>Young was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery (from 1937) and of the British Museum (1947&#150;57), a member of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries (from 1938), and of the Historical Manuscripts Commission (from 1948); all this work lay very close to his being and, until his health began to fail, he gave it much attention and thought. His was a slight figure with a scholarly stoop; he had a longish, inquisitive nose, eyes twinkling well ahead of a coming quip, an unusual manner of clearing his throat, a voice warm and vibrant. He was a shy man and, because sensitive, sometimes sharp: an intellectual who lived by his deep if hidden affections. Mona Wilson's death not long after the war, then the sale of the Oxyard, were blows from which he never recovered, but he built himself a new existence on his re-election in 1948 to All Souls, which provided him with a familiar and congenial refuge. He became a member of the royal commission on the press (1947&#150;9) and he received honorary degrees from Durham (1950) and Cambridge (1953); and&#151;what he valued most&#151;an honorary fellowship at Balliol in 1953.<br>
<br>His last book, <span class="italic">Stanley Baldwin</span> (1952), had been undertaken reluctantly, at Baldwin's own request. As he grew closer to his subject, Young was clearly somewhat taken aback by his discoveries, and it is not a satisfying book; Young's touch had begun to fail him. In 1956 he published, in collaboration with W. D. Handcock, <span class="italic">English Historical Documents, 1833&#150;74</span>, but Young's part in the volume, undertaken in 1947, was small. An invitation to lecture in Athens, which he had never visited, for a while renewed his flagging spirits, then a cloud descended on him and his death in the Thames Bank Nursing Home, Goring, Oxfordshire, on 18 November 1959 was a genuine release.<br>
<br>Young has been called a &#145;pantomath&#146;, a comment not displeasing to him. If he was not quite that, it was well said of him that few writers have said so many good things upon so many subjects. He lived up to his own definition of the historian as &#145;one for whom the past keeps something of the familiar triviality of the present, and the present has already some of the shadowy magnificence of the past&#146;.<br>
