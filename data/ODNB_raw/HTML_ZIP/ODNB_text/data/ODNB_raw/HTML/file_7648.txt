</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dillenius,  Johann Jakob</span>  (1687&#150;1747), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Darmstadt where his family, formerly Dill and later Dillen, civil servants in the state of Hesse, had settled at the end of the sixteenth century; his mother was the daughter of Danile Funk, clergyman. His father was professor of medicine at the University of Giessen, where he latinized his name to Dillenius. The young Dillenius practised medicine in Gr&uuml;nberg, Hesse, and qualified in 1713, being appointed town doctor (<i>Poliater</i>) in Giessen. His botanical interests led to his being elected to the Caesare Leopoldina-Carolina Academia Naturae-Curiosorum under the name of &#145;Glaucias&#146;, and he contributed several papers, mostly botanical, especially on cryptogams and their sexual organs. In 1718 (with another edition in 1719), he published <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum circa Gissam sponte nascentium</span>, enumerating 980 species of vascular plants, 200 of &#145;mosses&#146; and 160 fungi from the Giessen area, with many new genera and sixteen plates (now preserved in the Natural History Museum, London), drawn and engraved by the author. Although the work attracted much attention, Dillenius made little progress in Germany, probably because in it he criticized the classificatory system, based on the number and regularity of petals, of Augustus Bachmann (Rivinus), rightly preferring the system of the Englishman John Ray.<br>
<br>The British consul at Smyrna, the wealthy William Sherard, who was interested in the sexuality of cryptogams, persuaded Dillenius to move to England, which he did by August 1721. Dillenius stayed with Sherard at Oxford and afterwards in London, and with Sherard's brother James at Eltham, Kent, but also had lodgings in London, which in 1728 were in Barking Alley. He was the first president of the Botanical Society (London), being appointed in 1721. With John Martyn as its first secretary, the society met in the Rainbow Coffee House, Watling Street.<br>
<br>Sherard wanted Dillenius to arrange his herbarium and compile an encyclopaedia (<span class="italic">Pinax</span>) of all names given to plants, according to a 1623 plan originally conceived by Gaspard Bauhin (1560&#150;1624). He also wanted to endow the existing chair of botany at Oxford and appoint Dillenius to the post, but the unendowed chair was occupied by Gilbert Trowe (<i>c</i>.1685&#150;1737). Dillenius's first published work in England, however, was the third edition of Ray's <span class="italic">Synopsis stirpium Britannicarum</span> (July 1724), to which he added many species and twenty-four plates of rare plants; the basis for this work, which was effectively the textbook of British botany until the publication of Hudson's <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span> (1762), was his <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> herbarium, which is preserved at Oxford. In 1726, perhaps in preparation for a fourth edition, Dillenius made a botanical tour of Wales and the west of England with Littleton Brown (1699&#150;1749) and Samuel Brewer; plants, including the first British collection of a grass (<i>Koeleria vallesiana</i>) are preserved in Sloane's herbarium at the Natural History Museum.<br>
<br>About 1724 Dillenius, at James Sherard's suggestion, had begun illustrating and engraving plates for &#145;the most important book to be published in England during the eighteenth century on the plants growing in a private garden&#146;  (Henrey, 2.265), the <span class="italic">Hortus Elthamensis sua plantarum rariorum quas in horto suo Elthami &hellip; Jacobus Sherard</span> (two large folio volumes, 1732), illustrated by 417 drawings (a Leiden edition of 1774 comprising merely the plates), some also coloured by himself, with the pertinent specimens preserved at Oxford. It is important because of the new genera described and later taken up by Linnaeus and because of the accuracy of the plates, especially of succulent plants, which make bad specimens. James Sherard wanted a sumptuous tribute to his own glory but Dillenius resented neglecting his other work for a project on which he personally lost some &pound;200.<br>
<br>Dillenius was elected FRS in 1724 and was foreign secretary of the Royal Society in 1728&#150;47. In 1728 William Sherard died, bequeathing his herbarium and library and &pound;3000 to Oxford University to provide a salary for the professor of botany, on condition that the university pledge greater financial support for the botanic garden and that Dillenius should be the first professor, which post he finally gained, on Trowe's resignation, and after six years' wrangling between Sherard's executors and the university, in 1734, the same year he was admitted MD from St John's College. He had already visited Oxford to supervise plantings and construction of new conservatories in which the herbarium was temporarily housed. By 1735 he found that Sherard's legacy had been invested unwisely and his stipend was both in arrears and reduced.<br>
<br>Before August 1724 he had begun research on his greatest work, the <span class="italic">Historia muscorum</span> (1742), illustrated by eighty-five plates of which the drawings for the first seventy-nine are preserved in the Natural History Museum; the <span class="italic">Historia</span> is one of the first English botanical books to include references to the work of Linnaeus, who in the summer of 1736 spent a month with Dillenius at Oxford after which the Swedish naturalist dedicated his <span class="italic">Critica botanica</span> to him. Subscribers paid a guinea for a copy but sales were poor and Dillenius decided on an abridged edition; this, however, was never published, though there were 1763 and 1768 (London) and 1822 (Edinburgh) editions of the complete work. He prepared in Oxford a catalogue of Thomas Shaw's plants collected in north Africa and the Levant and at least 250 unpublished coloured drawings of fungi, a subject which he studied with his friend, the German George Deering.<br>
<br>Dillenius was somewhat corpulent and, in March 1747, was seized with apoplexy, from which he died in Oxford on 2 April; he was buried at St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, leaving the <span class="italic">Pinax</span> unfinished. His pupil, Humphrey Sibthorp, succeeded him as professor.<br>
<br>Dillenius was contemporaneous with both Ray and Linnaeus: adhering to the &#145;natural system&#146; of Ray, which philosophy is acceptable today, he was wise to appreciate the pragmatic approach of Linnaeus. He was central to British botany in academic as opposed to virtuoso circles, advancing basic knowledge besides cataloguing the world's flora. Linnaeus, who sent him specimens of Old World tropical trees, commemorated him in a genus <i>Dillenia</i>: &#145;of all plants [it] has the showiest flower and fruit, even as Dillenius made a brilliant show among botanists&#146;.<br>
