<span class="headword">MacColl,  Ewan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>James Henry Miller]</span>  (1915&#150;1989), <span class="occ">songwriter, folk-singer, and playwright</span>, was born James Henry Miller on 25 January 1915 at 4 Andrew Street, Broughton, Salford, Lancashire, the youngest and only surviving child in the family of three sons and one daughter (one of each sex was stillborn and one son died at the age of four) of William Miller, ironmoulder, of Salford, and his wife, Betsy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henry, charwoman. He was educated at Grecian Street School, Salford. He left school at the age of fourteen after an elementary education and was immediately unemployed. He joined the Young Communist League (he was not to leave the Communist Party until the early 1960s) and then found work as a motor mechanic, factory worker, and street singer. He first began writing for factory newspapers, composing satirical songs and political poems, while also taking a keen interest in amateur dramatics, in 1931 forming a political street theatre group, the Red Megaphones, which performed sketches on the streets of Salford and Manchester. Both his parents were fine traditional singers, and he had begun to sing and write songs while a teenager. One of his first and finest protest songs, &#145;The Manchester Rambler&#146;, dealt with the &#145;mass trespass&#146; campaigns of the 1930s, in which hikers fought pitched battles with gamekeepers when they invaded privately owned grouse moors.<br>
<br>It was two decades before he devoted his energies to music. He spent most of the 1930s involved in experimental theatre projects after joining forces with his future wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77256/', "(Maudie) Joan Littlewood (1914&#150;2002)")</script>, with whom he formed a &#145;workers' experimental theatre&#146;, the Theatre of Action, at Manchester in 1934. Miller wrote and co-produced a series of political satires and dance dramas, and was arrested and charged with disturbing the peace after the police stopped performances of his &#145;living newspaper&#146;, &#145;Last Edition&#146;. In the Second World War he was called up, joined the army, and was arrested for desertion, although he claimed there had been a case of mistaken identity. He was discharged on medical grounds. He continued with his drama projects after the war, and he and Littlewood formed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96341', "Theatre Workshop")</script>, for which he became art director and resident dramatist. He changed his name to Ewan MacColl in 1945. Between 1945 and 1952 he wrote eleven plays, including <span class="italic">Uranium 235</span> (1952), a drama with music, and <span class="italic">Landscape with Chimneys</span> (1951), which included one of his best-known songs, &#145;Dirty Old Town&#146;, written in a matter of hours on the opening night to cover a scene change.<br>
<br>MacColl severed his professional links with Littlewood in 1952 and gradually withdrew from the Theatre Workshop. From 1952 onwards he worked to establish a folk-song revival in Britain. He saw folk music not as some quaint historical curiosity but as a political force, an expression of working-class culture, and he wanted to develop a style in which &#145;songs of struggle would be immediately acceptable to a lot of young people&#146;. With help from American folklorist Alan Lomax and A. L. (Bert) Lloyd, he mixed politics, British and American folk music, and jazz in a radio series, <span class="italic">Ballads and Blues</span> (1953). He founded the Ballads and Blues Club, later renamed the Singers' Club, in London, and by the mid-1950s was considered one of the leading folk-singers in the country.<br>
<br>Initially, MacColl had encouraged the fashion for American folk and blues (he and Lomax had even started a skiffle group, which included another American singer and songwriter, Peggy Seeger, who was to become his third wife), but by the late 1950s he became concerned that British traditional music was being swamped by American styles. He therefore introduced his controversial &#145;policy rule&#146;&#151;singers had to perform songs from their own tradition, depending on whether they were British or American.<br>
<br>In 1957, when he claimed there were 1500 folk clubs around Britain, MacColl returned to experimental multi-media work, this time with a distinctively British flavour. The <span class="italic">Radio Ballads</span>, broadcast on the BBC Home Service from 1958 to 1964, dealt with the everyday lives of British workers, from railwaymen to boxers or fishermen, and used a montage of interviews and new songs written by MacColl. In collaboration with the radio producer Charles Parker, he began with <span class="italic">The Ballad of John Axon</span>, the story of an engine driver who had been killed at work and was awarded a posthumous George Cross. He wrote many of his best songs for this widely praised series, including &#145;Shoals of Herring&#146; and &#145;Freeborn Man&#146;.<br>
<br>A fiery, authoritative, opinionated figure, MacColl never deviated from his staunch left-wing views. From 1965 to 1971 he trained young singers in folk-singing and theatre technique in his Critics Group, which performed an annual review of the year's news, the &#145;Festival of Fools&#146;. He collected folk-songs, and co-wrote two books with Peggy Seeger (<span class="italic">Travellers' Songs from England and Scotland</span>, 1977, which was praised for its scholarship, and <span class="italic">Till Doomsday in the Afternoon, the Folklore of a Family of Scots Travellers</span>, 1986). With her he founded Blackthorne Records, which specialized in their own recordings. In the 1980s, by which time his jet-black hair and red beard had turned white, he wrote songs to support the miners' strike and the anti-apartheid movement. Considering his enormous and varied output, it was ironic that his only financial success came from his song &#145;The first time ever I saw your face&#146;, a no. 1 hit in America for Roberta Flack in 1972. It won the Ivor Novello award in 1973. MacColl was awarded an honorary degree by Exeter University in 1986.<br>
<br>On 2 November 1935 MacColl married Joan Maudie Littlewood (1914&#150;2002), who did not know the identity of her father, but was brought up by a stepfather, Jimmy Morritt, asphalter. They were divorced in 1948 and in 1949 he married Jean, daughter of William Newlove, a wartime director of regional supplies and part-time artist. They had a son, Hamish, and a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74976/', "Kirsty Anna MacColl")</script>, a very successful singer&#150;songwriter. They were divorced in 1974 and he married his third wife, the singer Peggy Seeger, with whom he had lived since the 1950s, in 1977. She was the daughter of Charles Seeger, musicologist, and sister of the singer Pete Seeger. MacColl died on 22 October 1989 in the Brompton Hospital, London, after complications following heart surgery, and his autobiography <span class="italic">Journeyman</span> was published the following year.<br>
