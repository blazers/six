<span class="headword">Mole <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jones]</span>,  Harriet <span class="st"> [Jeannie]</span>  Fisher</span>  (1841&#150;1912), <span class="occ">socialist and women's trade union organizer</span>, was born on 2 May 1841 at Edgeworth Street, Warrington, the daughter of Evan Jones, whitesmith, and his wife, Harriet <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher. Following &#145;an exceedingly happy childhood spent in a religious home&#146;  (<span class="italic">Labour Annual</span>, 180), Jeannie, as she was known, married fruit merchant Robert Frederick Willis in 1860 in Blackburn. As a young wife she visited New York, where she became concerned with social issues and worked for black rights. Returning to London with Robert, she worked with a sisterhood active among slum dwellers. However, reading Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin alerted Jeannie to the causes of the poverty she sought to alleviate, and she converted to socialism.<br>
<br>In London on 2 May 1879 Jeannie married a printer, (William) Keartland Mole, born in Liverpool, where they moved at some point in that year. She found only six other socialists there, so with Robert Frederick Evan (Fred) Willis, the son of her first marriage, she initiated propaganda meetings. These developed into the Workers' Brotherhood, Liverpool's first socialist society, much of whose small membership later helped form the Liverpool Fabian Society (1892). Committedly unsectarian, Jeannie Mole joined the Fabians, the Social Democratic Federation, and the Independent Labour Party. However, it was against the wave of new unionism which swept Merseyside from 1889 to 1891 that she began the work of organizing women's trade unions for which she subsequently became best known. She began this in May 1888, helped by Fred Willis, whose articles in <span class="italic">The Liverpool Review</span> that month highlighted the plight of Liverpool's sweated women workers. In January 1889 she formed the Liverpool Workwomen's Society, comprising bookfolders, tailoresses, and cigarmakers. Helped by the London-based Women's Provident and Protection League, this relaunched in 1890 as the Liverpool Society for the Promotion of Women's Trade Unions (SPWTU), its membership expanding into unskilled trades.<br>
<br>External organization proved a difficult task, and by October 1894 Jeannie Mole admitted that &#145;the call should come with the need from the women themselves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Labour Chronicle</span>, October 1894). Accordingly, the society became the Liverpool Women's Industrial Council (LWIC) in February 1895, partly inspired by the Women's Industrial Council which was formed in London in November 1894 to collect information about women's working conditions with a view to improving them. As honorary secretary, Jeannie felt the LWIC required an organizing function, and used her position to support a strike and encourage unionization among Liverpool rope-workers. This proved unpopular with the non-socialist members of the council, and by its AGM of 1897 it was in disarray, with liberal members condemning its &#145;advanced wing&#146; and socialists seeking a return to the earlier SPWTU  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Review</span>, 13 March 1897). By 1898 Jeannie Mole had largely dissociated from the council, and was encouraging women to join the Liverpool branch of Tom Mann's Workers' Union.<br>
<br>Jeannie Mole felt socialism united her in a common sisterhood with all women. Although she did not participate in local suffrage campaigns, her political work demonstrated a woman-centred approach. She initiated and edited a &#145;Women's Page&#146; in the <span class="italic">Liverpool Labour Chronicle</span> whose scope ranged from local disputes involving women to issues of women's health. She also promoted dress reform, and almost exclusively dressed in a Grecian style gown &#145;becomingly and without corsets&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, 12 March 1898).<br>
<br>In 1896 Jeannie suffered a serious heart attack through overwork. She recovered sufficiently to attend an international congress that July, but further illness in 1897 effectively curtailed her organizational work. Although she largely withdrew from active life she continued to host activities such as socialist garden parties at her home at Dacre Hill, Rock Ferry, Cheshire, and to provide a home for visiting lecturers from many socialist organizations. Jeannie Mole died suddenly on 15 April 1912 in Paris during a visit intended to improve her health. She was cremated at P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery, Paris, her subsequent funeral at Higher Bebington on 22 April being attended by local Fabians and socialists. Predeceased by her son in 1905, she was survived by her husband.<br>
