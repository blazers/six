<span class="headword">Codd,  Clara Margaret</span>  (1876&#150;1971), <span class="occ">suffragette and theosophist</span>, was born on 10 October 1876 at Pill House, Bishops Tawton, Barnstaple, north Devon, the eldest of ten children of Henry Frederick Codd (<i>d</i>. 1899) and his wife, Clara Virginia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Botto (1853&#150;1927). She was educated at home by governesses, and at fifteen rejected Christianity and declared herself an atheist. When she was twenty-three her father, a school inspector, died and the family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where Codd financed her sisters' education by herself working as a governess. In addition to teaching English and music, she worked as a costume model and travelled across France and Switzerland playing the violin and piano in orchestras. She later wrote of how her experiences in Geneva marked<blockquote>the first time in life I came into contact with all sorts and conditions of men, and learned to be free and a friend of all that lives, instead of the proper, little caste-ridden Victorian that I was in the beginning. (Codd, 24)</blockquote>It was in Geneva that Codd first came into contact with the movement to which she dedicated her life. A friend took her to hear Colonel Henry Olcott speak on theosophy; she later wrote of how &#145;Life changed miraculously for me from that moment onwards&#146;  (Codd, 29). The family soon returned to England and settled in Bath, where Codd, and later her mother, began to attend the local Theosophical Society lodge.<br>
<br>Codd officially joined the Theosophical Society in 1903, at about the same time that she joined the socialist Social Democratic Federation. In 1907 she joined the militant, Pankhurst-led Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), principally inspired by the work of one of the national organizers, Annie Kenney. Codd became close friends with Kenney and was active in arranging and speaking at street meetings in Bristol, often experiencing physical violence. In 1908 she participated in a &#145;rush&#146; on the House of Commons, managing to enter the building despite a heavy police presence. She was discovered and arrested, and went on to serve a one-month sentence in Holloway gaol.<br>
<br>On her release Codd returned to Bristol, only to face increased violence in the local campaign. She was offered a paid position as a WSPU organizer but turned it down in order to dedicate herself fully to theosophy. After a short period of employment as a teacher, she was offered work as a lecturer by the Theosophical Society, and soon spent two years at the society's headquarters in Adyar, India, as the result of a private bequest. She continued to lecture for the society throughout the 1910s, her wages being raised by the head of the movement, Annie Besant. Codd spent the remainder of her life as a travelling lecturer for the Theosophical Society, spending several years in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, where she was general secretary from 1935 to 1936, and in South Africa, where she lived during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Codd was both unassuming and sincere; her ability to communicate directly across class and cultural barriers undoubtedly contributed to her international success as a lecturer. Her history of addressing working men and women in the socialist and suffrage movements had developed her skills as a public speaker, while her experiences as a young woman in the cosmopolitan circles of Geneva had encouraged her to be accomplished, informed, and, importantly, self-reliant.<br>
<br>There is little secondary work on Codd: the most detailed sources remain her own writings. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">So Rich a Life</span>, published in 1951, records details of her travels and remains the fullest published account of her life. She wrote several books on theosophy, including <span class="italic">Trust your Self to Life</span> (1968), <span class="italic">The Way of the Disciple</span> (1964), <span class="italic">The Mystery of Life</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">On Lecturing</span> (1921), which featured a foreword by Annie Besant. Many of her works have remained in print and in use by members of the movement decades after her death. Codd died at Heatherwood Hospital, Ascot, Sunninghill, Berkshire, of heart failure on 3 April 1971.<br>
