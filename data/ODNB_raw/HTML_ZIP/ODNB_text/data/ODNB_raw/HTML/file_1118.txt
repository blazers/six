<span class="headword">Baker,  George</span>  (1781&#150;1851), <span class="occ">county historian</span>, the son of Richard Baker and his wife, Ann, was born in Northampton and lived there all his life. As a thirteen-year-old schoolboy at Mr Comfield's establishment in Horsemarket, Northampton, he wrote a manuscript history of Northampton and a life of Dr John Hinchcliffe (<i>d</i>. 1794), bishop of Peterborough. After leaving school he became a wool-stapler and pursued antiquarian interests in his spare time, notably by assisting John Britton with the Northamptonshire section of <span class="italic">The Beauties of England and Wales</span>. That appeared in 1810, as did Baker's first published work, <span class="italic">A Catalogue of Books, Poems, Tracts, and Small Detached Pieces</span>; only twenty copies of this work appeared, privately published on the Strawberry Hill Press. Baker's proposals for <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Northampton</span> were issued in 1815. Correspondence suggests it was conceived originally as a partnership between himself, Britton, and the leading topographical publisher John Bowyer Nichols. The final terms of agreement are unknown, but it was Nichols who published the five parts of Baker's <span class="italic">History</span> which appeared in 1822&#150;41.<br>
<br>The first volume, published in three parts between 1822 and 1830, contained the hundreds of Spelhoe, Newbottle Grove, Fawsley, Chipping Warden, and Kings Sutton. Based on extensive documentary work, excavations, questionnaires, and parochial visits, considerable assistance during the last being provided by Baker's sister and constant companion of sixty years <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1106/', "Anne Elizabeth Baker (1786&#150;1861)")</script>, the volume was well received. Nevertheless, from early as 1822 the exacting standards that Baker set himself had given rise to misgivings about the likelihood of the enterprise being completed. Volume two, intended to complete the southern third of the county, began to appear in 1836 with a part containing Norton and Cleley; a second, in 1841, covered Towcester. By then, however, Baker's health and will were broken and 220 of his subscribers, 400 strong at the outset, had died or resigned. He had also run through most of his fortune, and in 1842 his antiquities, library, and manuscript collections were dispersed in a six-day sale. The last were acquired by Sir Thomas Phillipps and are now part of the Phillipps collection in the Bodleian Library. A place index was published in 1868.<br>
<br>Baker, who was a Unitarian, took a deep interest in various local institutions, and was a magistrate for the borough of Northampton. He died unmarried at his home, Hazelrigg House, in Gold Street, Northampton, on 12 October 1851, and was buried in the Independent chapel in King Street.<br>
