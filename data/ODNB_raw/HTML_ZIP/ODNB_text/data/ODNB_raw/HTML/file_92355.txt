<span class="headword">Jacob,  William Beale</span>  (1825&#150;1902), <span class="occ">biscuit manufacturer</span>, was born at 33 Bridge Street, Waterford, Ireland, on 17 August 1825, the elder son (a daughter had died at birth) of Isaac Thomas Jacob (1790&#150;1839) and his wife, Anne Beale (1795&#150;1854), daughter of a woollen manufacturer. The Jacob family had emigrated to Ireland from south-west England a century and a half earlier to escape government persecution for their Quaker beliefs. Isaac Jacob was reserved and over-scrupulous in his business dealings, after a childhood clouded by the financial embarrassments of his father, a corn merchant. His large bakery in Waterford supplied the thriving port with bread, ship's biscuits, and yeast for sale. In the meeting-house he was a conscientious overseer and elder. He sent William to a Quaker school in Cirencester and then apprenticed him to the trade.<br>
<br>After Isaac's premature death on 23 March 1839, his widow managed the bakery, but before he was twenty William Jacob had taken over, in due course introducing his younger brother, Robert (1831&#150;1861), as partner in what became W. and R. Jacob &amp; Co. Timid and bookish as a child, William later came to enjoy roaming the countryside, climbing, swimming, and boating. On 1 August 1850 he married Hannah Hill (1819&#150;1906), eldest of the seven daughters of Joshua and Isabella Newsom; they had six sons and two daughters. With the business achieving annual sales of &pound;4650 in that year, Jacob started making fancy (or sweet) biscuits, in competition with imports from Carrs of Carlisle and McVities and other Edinburgh manufacturers. To gain the necessary expertise William Jacob spent some months in England. He then purchased a former coach factory in Peter's Row, Dublin, and began production there. In 1852 he mechanized operations by installing a 5 hp steam engine and a travelling oven, through which the biscuits were transported while being cooked. Seven years later, sales had risen nearly fivefold to more than &pound;21,000. The Waterford bakery was closed in 1858 when Robert, its manager, moved to Dublin and became the firm's traveller. Jacob's brother-in-law, George John Newsom, was already a partner, but in 1861 Robert accidentally drowned and was replaced by a Quaker relative, William Frederick Bewley. The three families of Jacob, Newsom, and Bewley continued to run the business together until the second half of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>William Jacob's son George became a partner in 1878, when the partnership capital was &pound;27,000, up from &pound;861 in 1850, with William holding the largest share of &pound;11,000. W. and R. Jacob &amp; Co. Ltd was registered in 1883, with William as chairman. Nearing sixty, he handed operational control over to George Jacob and William Bewley as managing directors. To ensure the succession, two of William's younger sons subsequently entered the company. In 1885 a turning-point occurred in the firm's history, when it introduced a biscuit that soon became its most sought-after brand: the Cream Cracker. Pale, relatively plain and crisp, it formed a palatable snack when spread with butter and covered with fragments of cheese or savoury meats. Its recipe came from the United States, where George Jacob had learnt about cracker-making technology. A year later the board took an equally far-reaching decision: to challenge the well-entrenched competition in England and Scotland by setting up a depot in Liverpool. William's son Albert moved there to manage the sales side, and later opened depots in London and Manchester. Jacobs now enjoyed such prosperity that in 1892 it doubled its capital to &pound;100,000. William Jacob, while remaining as chairman, handed over all responsibilities to the younger directors and moved to Ballybrack House, Military Road, Killiney, on the coast south of Dublin. He died there on 5 August 1902, and was interred at the Friends' burial-ground, Temple Hill, Blackrock, Dublin; he was survived by his wife, who died on 29 November 1906. Jacob's wealth can be gauged from the &pound;82,327 he left to his three director sons. His family remembered this full-bearded man as generous, sympathetic, and considerate, but he made such little mark in outside life that the Dublin press and Quaker publications barely noted his passing.<br>
<br>The company began production at Aintree, Liverpool, in 1912. Ten years later, when the Irish Free State was established, the English and Irish companies became separate legal entities, while sharing a chairman and several directors. In 1960 Jacobs of England joined Huntley and Palmers and Peek Frean in the Associated Biscuit Manufacturers Ltd, which in 1982 became part of the American food giant Nabisco Brands. In the early 1990s BSN Danone of France, Europe's largest producer of biscuits and snack foods, bought Nabisco Brands' European operations and then acquired the Irish company. The Cream Cracker continued to be the staple product of the Jacobs subsidiary at Aintree, its head office from 1998 onwards.<br>
