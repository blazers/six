<span class="headword">Mulholland,  John</span>, first Baron Dunleath  (1819&#150;1895), <span class="occ">textile manufacturer</span>, was born at Belfast on 16 December 1819, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19511/', "Andrew Mulholland (1791&#150;1866)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacDonnell. In 1840, following education at Belfast Royal Academy, John Mulholland went into partnership with his father. The elder Mulholland remains one of the most famous figures in the history of the Ulster linen industry who, together with his brother, Thomas, introduced the wet-spinning of flax into Belfast in 1828, using steam-powered machinery. When John Mulholland joined the firm twelve years later, the Mulholland mill was one of the largest of thirty-five flax-spinning enterprises in Ulster, employing 900 workers and containing 15,000 spindles. John Mulholland became the sole proprietor in 1846, when his father withdrew to the rural pleasures of Ballywalter Park, later known as Springvale, purchased from the Matthews family, who had owned it from early in the century.<br>
<br>In 1851 Mulholland married Frances Louise, daughter of Hugh Lyle of Knockintarn, co. Londonderry. They had three sons. Mulholland took as his managing partner his sister's husband, Nicholas de la Cherois Crommelin, and together they created an integrated spinning and weaving business, reorganized in 1851 as the York Street Flax Spinning Company. Crommelin retired in 1860 and was replaced by Ogilvy Blair Graham. The company prospered during the cotton famine of the 1860s and adopted limited liability in 1865&#151;one of the first businesses in Ireland to do so&#151;with a nominal share value of &pound;500,000. It survived the depression that followed the American Civil War by careful attention to overseas marketing and further integration. Branches were opened in Paris (1870), New York (1871), Berlin (1872), London (1874), and Melbourne (1892). In 1883 it purchased a bleach works at Muckamore in co. Antrim. By the time John Mulholland died, the York Street Flax Spinning Company was the largest integrated flax-spinning and -weaving business in the world.<br>
<br>Although Mulholland remained nominally in control, his connection with the business became increasingly tenuous, and he left the day-to-day supervision to the board of directors, including R. R. Reade and Sir William Crawford. When the firm adopted limited liability, he sold a substantial portion of his personal shares for &pound;164,250 and with the proceeds of the sale purchased the Southwell estate, property of the former lord of the manor in Downpatrick, co. Down, as well as land in co. Tyrone&#151;adopting, as his father had done, the lifestyle of a country gentleman. Mulholland also became well known, in Britain, if not in Ireland, as an enthusiastic yachtsman, the owner of the <i>Egeria</i>. When he died, the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> (13 December 1895) commented, a little tartly, that &#145;he has for the past quarter of a century been seen very little in Belfast&#146;. The <span class="italic">News Letter</span> (13 December 1895) was more charitable, declaring that he &#145;never lost his interest in Belfast and its people&#146;.<br>
<br>These conflicting assessments of Mulholland's later life stemmed in part from the different political perspectives of the two newspapers, for Mulholland had political ambitions in the Conservative and Unionist cause. At the 1868 general election the Belfast Conservative Association nominated Sir Charles Lanyon, architect and former lord mayor, together with Mulholland as candidates. Mulholland was unpopular among working men, which may indicate his reputation as an employer, and they ran a small-time Orange landowner against him. Mulholland lost. However, in 1874 he was elected for the tiny constituency of Downpatrick (dismissed contemptuously by the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> as a pocket borough), and remained an MP until the seat was abolished in 1885.<br>
<br>As a political figure Mulholland's achievements were modest. In 1860 he was &#145;one of those chosen to consider and report on the negotiations for a commercial treaty with France&#146;. In 1868 he served on a royal commission appointed to consider the advantages of the state buying the Irish railways. He was high sheriff for co. Down in 1868 and for co. Tyrone in 1873. He was a JP for co. Antrim and co. Down, and deputy lieutenant for co. Antrim. He received an honorary LLD from Trinity College, Dublin in 1881. In 1892 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dunleath of Ballywalter, co. Down.<br>
<br>Mulholland's other principal interest was the Church of Ireland. He assisted in the financial settlement following disestablishment in 1869, and was a member of the general synod, and the synods of the dioceses of Down and Connor, and Dromore. He was a generous supporter of the Church of Ireland Young Men's Society. He died at his London home, 7 Eaton Square, on 11 December 1895 after a long illness, and was buried on 17 December at the family home, Springvale, in the parish of Ballywalter. His wife survived him and his eldest son, Herbert Lyle Mulholland (1854&#150;1931), succeeded to the title.<br>
