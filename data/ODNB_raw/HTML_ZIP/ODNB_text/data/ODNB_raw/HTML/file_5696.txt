<span class="headword">Clive,  Edward</span>, first earl of Powis  (1754&#150;1839), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born in Queen Square, London, on 7 March 1754, the first of the four surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5697/', "Robert Clive, first Baron Clive of Plassey (1725&#150;1774)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63502/', "Margaret Clive (1735&#150;1817)")</script>, daughter of Edmund Maskelyne of Purton, Wiltshire. He was educated at Eton College between 1762 and 1770 and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 28 February 1771. His education was completed by a period spent in Geneva with a tutor.<br>
<br>The death of his father in November 1774 meant that Clive inherited a significant territorial and political presence in Shropshire and the border counties. The wealth acquired by Robert Clive as a result of his activities in India had been used to purchase estates and electoral power. In particular, Clive's influence had eclipsed that of Henry Arthur Herbert (<i>c</i>.1703&#150;1772), who had been created earl of Powis (second creation) in 1748. Herbert had inherited the estates of the marquesses of Powis, which included property in Shropshire and Montgomeryshire, and had acquired political influence in the region. Relations between the Clive and Herbert families, which had been shaped by political and financial considerations, were cemented on 7 May 1784, when Edward Clive married Lady Henrietta Antonia Herbert (1758&#150;1830), daughter of the earl of Powis.<br>
<br>Clive was MP for Ludlow between 1774 and 1794, served as lord lieutenant of Shropshire from 1775 to 1798 and from 1804 to 1839 and of Montgomeryshire between 1804 and 1830, and was recorder of Shrewsbury and Ludlow. In the House of Commons he supported the North administration and, following the dismissal of the Fox&#150;North coalition in 1783, he went into opposition. He was, however, anxious to improve upon the Irish title given to his father and therefore transferred his support to Pitt. He was rewarded with the creation of a British peerage (Baron Clive of Walcot) in 1794.<br>
<br>Although Clive's experience of public office at the national level had been limited to his appointment in 1793 to the board of agriculture, he was appointed to the governorship of Madras in 1797 and took up the post in August 1798. The appointment seems to have owed much to Clive's need for additional income and to the Clive family's connection with India. Arthur Wellesley described him at this time as a &#145;mild, moderate man, remarkably reserved, having a bad delivery, and apparently a heavy understanding&#146;  (Archer, 25). Shortly after his arrival Clive was involved in preparations for the attack upon Tipu Sultan of Mysore, which culminated in the successful assault on Seringapatam in May 1799. The resulting settlement of Mysore greatly extended British influence in the region, and during the remaining years of his governorship Clive continued to provide able support for the policy of consolidation and expansion of the British position in south India which was promoted by the governor-general, Lord Wellesley. The East India Company took over the administration of Tanjore in 1799 and that of the territories of the nawab of Arcot in 1801; in 1803 a decisive victory was won over Maratha forces at Assaye. Clive resigned his governorship, which appears to have been conducted very much under Wellesley's aegis, in August 1803, although he had almost done so earlier on account of a perception that he had lost the confidence of the directors of the company.<br>
<br>On his return to England Clive was able to add the numerous Indian curiosities that he and Lady Clive had acquired to the collection formed by his father. Clive and his wife shared an interest in natural history and collected animals, seeds, and plants. The death of Lady Clive's unmarried brother, the earl of Powis, in 1801 without an heir further strengthened the union of the Clive and Herbert families, since the Powis estates passed to Clive's eldest son, who in 1807 took the name of Herbert instead of Clive. On 14 May 1804 Clive was created earl of Powis of the third creation.<br>
<br>Although nominated as lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1805, Clive did not take up the post. He died at his home, 45 Berkeley Square, London, on 16 May 1839, and was buried at Bromfield, Shropshire, nine days later. His wife having died in 1830, he left two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13024/', "Edward Herbert, second earl of Powis")</script>, and one daughter. Another daughter predeceased him.<br>
