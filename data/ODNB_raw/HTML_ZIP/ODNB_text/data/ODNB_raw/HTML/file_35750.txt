<span class="headword">Ridding,  George</span>  (1828&#150;1904), <span class="occ">headmaster and bishop of Southwell</span>, was born on 16 March 1828 in Winchester College, third son of Charles Henry Ridding (<i>d</i>. 1871), afterwards vicar of Andover, and his wife, Charlotte Stonhouse (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter of Timothy Stonhouse-Vigor, archdeacon of Gloucester, and granddaughter of Sir James Stonhouse, eleventh baronet. George Isaac Huntingford, bishop of Gloucester and Hereford and warden of Winchester, was his great-great-uncle and godfather. The death of his mother and his experience of religious conversion as a boy were crucial early influences. From 1840 to 1846 he was a scholar of Winchester (where his father had been second master), rising to be head of the school, while his three brothers won equal distinction as cricketers. In default of a vacancy at New College, Oxford, he matriculated as a commoner at Balliol, where he rowed in the college boat and gained the Craven scholarship, a first class in classics and a second in mathematics, and a mathematical fellowship at Exeter College (all in 1851). He won the Latin essay prize and proceeded MA in 1853; and took the degree of DD in 1869. From 1853 to 1863 he was tutor of Exeter, where he played a significant part in developing the modern tutorial system and in cultivating closer relations between undergraduates and dons. He was identified as on the liberal side of contemporary university controversies. His 1864 Oxford sermon on &#145;Liberty of teaching&#146; stated his belief in free discussion and the open pursuit of truth. On 20 July 1858 he married Mary Louisa, third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18862/', "George Moberly")</script>, headmaster of Winchester, and was one of the first married dons at Oxford. Devastated by his wife's early death, on the first anniversary of their marriage, he checked his grief by strength of will, which was already tested by a continual struggle against poor eyesight. To many he seemed a shy, austere character.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1863 Ridding was elected second master of Winchester; and on 27 September 1866 when Moberly, his father-in-law, resigned the headmastership, he was at once elected to succeed him. The Clarendon commission of inquiry into public schools had reported in 1864, and the time was ripe for reform. Carrying on the tradition initiated by Moberly, he established six additional boarding-houses. New classrooms were added, playing fields were acquired, and the chapel was rearranged. These additions to the facilities were personally financed by Ridding to the extent of &pound;20,000, of which only about half was eventually repaid to him. Pupil numbers rose from about 250 to over 400, and might have grown further but for his conviction that a school should not exceed the number with which a headmaster could keep in personal touch.<br>
<br>Described as the &#145;second founder of Winchester&#146;, Ridding was one of the most prominent members of the generation of headmasters who created the public school system in its familiar form at the end of the nineteenth century. He attended the second meeting of the Headmasters' Conference, held at Sherborne in 1870, and was chairman of its standing committee until 1874. He was one of the founders in 1873 of the Oxford and Cambridge schools examination board, whose inspections and certificates averted the threat of state-controlled school examinations. Although he was a classicist, Ridding widened the curriculum at Winchester without relegating new subjects, such as history, modern languages, and natural science, to a separate &#145;modern side&#146;. Following the example of Uppingham, he established a school mission, first in 1876 at Bromley in east London, and subsequently in 1882 at Landport in Portsmouth.<br>
<br>At Winchester, Ridding succeeded in carrying with him in a course of drastic reforms the co-operation and devotion of his assistant masters, whose numbers he doubled during his period of office. He often faced opposition from the fellows, who before 1871 constituted the governing body of the college, and was strenuously criticized by Wykehamists in general. His position as a Liberal did not stand easily with the Conservative predilections of both old boys and current pupils alike. A public controversy in November and December 1872, the so-called &#145;tunding row&#146;, tested his commitment to boy government. A fifth-former, William Charles Macpherson (1855&#150;1936), later an Indian civil servant, was &#145;tunded&#146; with a ground-ash wielded by a prefect for refusing to submit to a customary ritual. The extent of the injuries sustained by &#145;tunded Macpherson&#146; was unclear, but the ensuing press outcry led to an inquiry by the school governors. Although the inquiry vindicated Ridding, the chairman of the governors, the fifteenth earl of Derby, and Stafford Northcote resigned in protest against the powers allowed to prefects. Ridding had originally attempted to allow the boys more freedom, but his anxiety about sexual vice among them, an issue on which he was particularly severe, led him to impose a more closely supervised regime after 1880.<br>
<br>Ridding married again on 26 October 1876; his second wife was Lady Laura Elizabeth Palmer [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50713/', "Ridding, Lady Laura Elizabeth (1849&#150;1939)")</script>], eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21210/', "Roundell Palmer, first earl of Selborne")</script>. Lady Laura Ridding, whose diaries are preserved in the Hampshire Record Office, later wrote the biography of her husband, and published editions of his writings and visitation charges.<br>
<br>In 1884 Ridding was appointed the first bishop of Southwell, on the nomination of Gladstone whose inquiries had established Ridding to be &#145;one of those large minded men who will work on the one hand with great devotion and energy, on the other hand with a liberal and just regard to the various shades of sentiment and practice united in the communion of the Church&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 11.113). He was consecrated on 1 May. Southwell was a new diocese, formed by separating the counties of Derby and Nottingham from the dioceses of Lichfield and Lincoln respectively. The cathedral town was so inaccessible that Ridding firmly declined to live in it, and rented Thurgarton Priory in Nottinghamshire as his residence in place of the ruined episcopal palace. In population the diocese was the fifth in England, but it had no chapter, no diocesan funds, no common organization; the two counties had diverse traditions, and much of the patronage remained in the hands of external bishops and chapters. Ridding's work was to bring unity and a corporate spirit out of diversity and jealousy, to create all kinds of diocesan organizations, to raise the intellectual standard of the clergy, and to stimulate spiritual life in neglected districts. As at Winchester, he was not understood at first, and encountered some opposition; but his sincerity, genuineness, and generosity (the whole of his official income was spent on the diocese) ultimately gained the affection and loyalty of both clergy and laity. Although he spoke, in 1888, of reunion between the Anglican church and dissent, he was emphatic in upholding the national church, and very definite in his advocacy of church principles. His independence and originality of thought made him a valued adviser of two successive archbishops of Canterbury; with Frederick Temple in particular he was united by cordial friendship, based on considerable resemblances of character. This same independence, on the other hand, often separated him from the main parties of church thought, and despite many similarities of outlook he was not formally identified with the broad-church party. During the controversy of 1902 on religious education, he was not in accord with either the government or the opposition of the day, but strenuously advocated a universal system of state schools, accompanied by universal liberty of religious teaching.<br>
<br>With the exception of a long holiday (necessitated by overwork) in Egypt and Greece from December 1888 to April 1889, Ridding's work in his diocese was unbroken. In 1891 he refused translation to Lichfield. In 1893, during the great strike in the coal trade, his efforts to restore peace were unceasing. In 1897 he presided at the Nottingham church congress, and in the same year became president of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. In July 1904, following repeated attacks of ill health, he tendered his resignation; but before it had taken effect an acute crisis supervened, and on 30 August he died at Thurgarton. He was buried just outside Southwell Minster.<br>
<br>Ridding published one volume of sermons, <span class="italic">The Revel and the Battle</span> (1897). His style, whether in writing or in speaking, was peculiar: full of thought, tersely and trenchantly expressed, but often difficult to follow from lack of connecting links and phrases. Contemporaries considered that this fault prevented him from exerting a wider influence  (Headlam, 242). A former pupil recalled a &#145;keen, alert man, with handsome, mobile features, the curling black hair, the piercing eye, the eyeglass&#151;now dropped, now fixed again, each time with queer but not inexpressive grimaces&#146;  (Bird, 733).<br>
