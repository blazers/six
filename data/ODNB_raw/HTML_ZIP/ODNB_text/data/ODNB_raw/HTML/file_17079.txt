<span class="headword">Lowe,  Edward William Howe de Lancy</span>  (1820&#150;1880), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17080/', "Sir Hudson Lowe (1769&#150;1844)")</script>, colonial governor, and his wife, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter of Stephen de Lancey and widow of Colonel William Johnson, was born in St Helena on 8 February 1820. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and on 20 May 1837 was appointed ensign in the 32nd regiment. He became lieutenant in 1841, captain in 1845, major in 1857, lieutenant-colonel in 1858, and colonel in 1863. He served with the regiment in the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848&#150;9, including the two sieges and capture of Multan and the battle of Gujrat. He was with the regiment at Lucknow at the outbreak of the Indian mutiny, and on 18 May 1857 was sent with his company to Cawnpore. General Wheeler, on hearing the state of affairs at Lucknow, sent the reinforcement back some days later, which thus escaped the massacres. When Inglis took command at Lucknow, on Sir Henry Lawrence's death, Lowe took command of the 32nd, which he held throughout the defence of the residency. On 26 September 1857 he commanded a sortie which captured seven guns, and he also commanded the party sent out to bring in the guns and stores with the rear-guard of Havelock's relieving force, which had arrived the day before. In these operations he was severely wounded. After the second relief by Colin Campbell, in October, Lowe commanded the 32nd at the defeat of the Gwalior rebels at Cawnpore on 6 December 1857 and during the ensuing campaign in Oudh from July 1858 to January 1859. He was mentioned in dispatches, given brevet promotion, and made a CB. Some letters sent by Lowe to his sister during the defence of the residency formed the basis of an article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (vol. 103, 1858). Lowe afterwards commanded in succession the 2nd battalion 21st regiment (Royal North British Fusiliers) and the 86th Royal County Down regiment. He retired on half pay in 1872 and became a major-general in 1877. He married Anne Louisa Russell, daughter of Maurice Peter Moore (1809&#150;1866) of Sleaford, Lincolnshire, solicitor and clerk of the peace for Kesteven; she survived her husband. Lowe died at his home, 11 Upper Berkeley Street, London, on 21 October 1880.<br>
