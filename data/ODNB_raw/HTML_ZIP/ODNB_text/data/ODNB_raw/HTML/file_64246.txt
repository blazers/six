<span class="headword">Drury,  (Alfred) Paul Dalou</span>  (1903&#150;1987), <span class="occ">artist and teacher of art</span>, was born on 14 October 1903 at Crescent Lodge, 2 Tressillian Crescent, Brockley, in south-east London, the elder of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32905/', "(Edward) Alfred Briscoe Drury RA (1856&#150;1944)")</script>, sculptor and painter, and Phebe Maud Turner (<i>c</i>.1884&#150;1928), painter, daughter of the Revd George Lyon Turner. In 1912 the family moved into Lancaster Lodge, a purpose-built house with a large studio in Lancaster Road, Wimbledon; this was Paul's home until his marriage, and there he not only assisted his father but also shared the studio for his own work. Drury displayed an early talent for drawing and by the age of ten had decided to be an artist. He attended King's College School in Wimbledon (1910&#150;13) and then Bristol grammar school (1913&#150;17), where in 1914 he suffered the tragic loss of an eye in a shooting accident. Undeterred he continued to draw; while at Westminster School, in London (1917&#150;21), he honed his draughtsmanship by making architectural drawings of the abbey cloisters, and his considerable talents in both art and music received particular encouragement.<br>
<br>Drury's enrolment in 1921 at the University of London's Goldsmiths' College, where he remained until 1926, marked the formal beginning of his artistic career and his lifelong association with the college's school of art (where his father still taught). Among his contemporaries were Graham Sutherland, William Larkins, and Edward Bouverie Hoyton, part of the group of landscape etchers in the pastoral tradition who came to be known as the Goldsmiths' School; in Sutherland particularly he found a kindred spirit and lifelong friend, and their landscape subjects reveal many similarities in ideas, motifs, and stylistic influences.<br>
<br>Drury was a gifted portraitist, and even his earliest student print is a work of astonishing virtuosity and maturity: <span class="italic">Old Frost</span> (1922; needled by Drury but etched by his tutor) demonstrates not only his masterly draughtsmanship, a sharp eye, and command of mass and form but also his sensitivity and humanity. A year later, after several more portrait heads, he etched his first landscape, <span class="italic">Hayling Island: Barn with Cart</span> (1923), a straightforward rural scene. In 1924 he won the British Institute scholarship for etching but later sacrificed the prix de Rome in order to assist his father, whose health was failing; he also exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy, and continued to do so almost annually until 1985. In 1926 he was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers; he was also invited (with Sutherland) by F. L. M. Griggs to take his plates to Griggs's studio to watch him print from them. His technical development was further enhanced by a major exhibition of Samuel Palmer's prints and drawings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, which displayed working proofs in progressive states accompanied by the artist's detailed notes. Drury's admiration of Palmer's glowing landscape etchings had already led him to experiment with the expressive use of light but it was not until <span class="italic">September</span> (1928), Drury's most important work, that the mystical influences were fully assimilated and he transcended the tranquil countryside to enter a visionary world of his own.<br>
<br>At the same time Drury was working on a series of portrait drawings (1927&#150;8) commissioned by New College, Oxford, and by Trinity College, Cambridge; he also produced <span class="italic">A Man of Fifty</span> (1928), a particularly sensitive portrait etching. Following an article, &#145;The etchings of Graham Sutherland and Paul Drury&#146;, in the authoritative journal <span class="italic">Print Collector's Quarterly</span> in January 1929 his first one-man show was held at the Twenty-One Gallery, London; he also co-founded the National Society of Painters, Sculptors, Engravers and Potters. Helping his father to complete his statue of Sir Joshua Reynolds, commissioned by the Royal Academy, left little time for his own work during 1929&#150;31.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Drury was busy teaching at several art schools, including Goldsmiths' College, the Royal Academy, the Central School of Arts and Crafts, Heatherley's, the Sir John Cass, and Kingston School of Art. His work began to be acquired by both public and private collections, and he continued to exhibit in Britain and (through the British Council) abroad. In 1932 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. He had been exhibiting regularly since 1926 and was to play an increasingly active role in the society, ultimately becoming its president, in 1970&#150;75. His reforms modernized and revitalized the society, broadening the membership, widening the scope of techniques, and establishing a more democratic ethos.<br>
<br>In 1936 Drury fell in love with and subsequently married one of his students. Though born into a Jewish family Enid Marie Solomon (1910&#150;1996), a talented painter, had already embraced Christianity, and they were married on 21 December 1937 in the parish church of St Marylebone, London. Having settled in London at 114 Haverstock Hill they joined the British Red Cross Society in 1938, when war was looming. Drury used his modelling experience to create plaster casts for limb prostheses at Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, prompting a move to Athelenary Cottage, 8 King's Road, Richmond, Surrey. War casualties provided subject matter for his constant drawing habit, and two small works from this period are in the Imperial War Museum's collection.<br>
<br>A son, Jolyon Victor Paul, was born on 19 November 1946, when the Drurys were living at Greville Lodge, 9 Greville Road, Richmond. They moved once more, to 13 King's Road (1956), before leaving Richmond in 1958 for Ranger's Cottage, Nutley, near Uckfield, Sussex, where Drury was to live for the remainder of his life. He had left Goldsmiths' in the late 1930s but returned to teaching there after the war. In 1947 he was elected chairman of the exhibitions committee of the Artists' International Association and also of the National Society of Painters, Sculptors, Engravers and Potters. He joined the faculty of engraving at the British School in Rome (1948&#150;74) and during the 1960s and 1970s also taught drawing and composition at summer schools at Urchfont Manor, near Devizes, Wiltshire, and at Attingham Park, Shropshire.<br>
<br>Drury was an inspirational if demanding teacher driven by his own love of the creative process to exact the highest standards through meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail, yet he dispensed advice gently and with humour. His extended association with the school of art at Goldsmiths' College culminated in his appointment as principal (1967&#150;9), shortly before he retired. A witty and convivial character never without a cigarette, he was popular with both students and staff, and was renowned for his prowess as raconteur and songwriter at Goldsmiths' social events. He was an erudite man of scintillating intellect who spoke Latin fluently, read musical scores with ease, adored Bach, and played the piano; one of his compositions for harpsichord was broadcast on BBC Radio 3. He also enjoyed watching cricket. He was dark-haired, with intense and sparkling grey eyes; in middle age he wore glasses or a monocle.<br>
<br>Drury continued to create and exhibit in his retirement, and also joined the governing body of the West Surrey School of Art (1969&#150;74). Two exhibitions of his work were held in his last years&#151;one, a major retrospective, in 1984 at Goldsmiths' College Gallery, and the other at Garton and Cooke, London, in 1987. He died at his home, Ranger's Cottage, Nutley, on 19 May 1987, after a succession of small strokes, and was buried in Putney cemetery on 26 May.<br>
<br>Drury created ninety-two prints, most unpublished and unsigned, all but a few being intaglio processes. The portrait etchings, which form the majority, are striking in their humanity; among the best are <span class="italic">Head of a Negro</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Old Man Reading II</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Mrs. Douglas James</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Carel Weight</span> (1938&#150;9). Published works, in editions varying up to 100, were sometimes signed in the plate with the initials &#145;PD&#146; (or &#145;P. D.&#146;) and date, or &#145;Paul Drury&#146; and date, but were just as likely to be unsigned; a catalogue raisonn&eacute; of the prints was published by Robin Garton in 1992. Drury also left a large body of richly-coloured oil paintings (landscapes and portraits), most of which remain in the family but some major works were sold at the Royal Academy's summer exhibitions. With their loose and freely applied brushstrokes his paintings are the antithesis of the controlled precision of his delicately drawn etchings. A substantial archive, including sketchbooks, drawings, and prints in several states, is held by the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, British Columbia; other works are held in Boston Public Library, Massachusetts; the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; the British Museum, London; the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff; the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
<br>Drury was a leading printmaker and accomplished painter who strove after perfection and devoted himself to instilling his values in the young. A modest man, he shunned the limelight, and his works were therefore little known, even by his pupils. But his importance lies in his contribution to the continuity of traditional printmaking skills, both in his own work and through his influence on generations of art students during a lifetime of teaching. A major biography and critical appreciation was prepared by Jolyon Drury to celebrate his father's centenary in 2003.<br>
