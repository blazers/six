<span class="headword">Keys <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grey]</span>, Lady  Mary</span>  (1545?&#150;1578), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was probably born at Bradgate Hall, Leicestershire, the youngest of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11535/', "Henry Grey, duke of Suffolk (1517&#150;1554)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65987/', "Frances Grey, duchess of Suffolk (1517&#150;1559)")</script>, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3260/', "Charles Brandon, first duke of Suffolk")</script>, and Henry VIII's younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18251/', "Mary")</script>. On 21 May 1553 Mary was betrothed to her cousin Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton, whose father was an ally of the duke of Northumberland. The attainder and execution of Suffolk in February 1554, however, ruined Mary's marital prospects. Not only was the match with Wilton set aside, but she also lost the prospect of a large inheritance. On her mother's death she co-inherited several baronies which gave her an income of &pound;20 a year from estates in Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, and Nottinghamshire, but the remainder of Frances's property went to her second husband, Adrian Stokes, until his death. Lady Mary was made maid of honour to Elizabeth and received a pension of &pound;80 a year from the queen.<br>
<br>On 10 or 12 August 1565 Mary secretly married Thomas Keys 
    (or Keyes; <i>d</i>. 1571)
  , the queen's sergeant porter. They were an ill-matched pair, for Mary was described as &#145;little, crook-backed and very ugly&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 468), while her husband was stout and about 6 feet 8 inches tall. He was also more than twice her age and a widower with six or seven children. Finally, he was a minor gentleman from Kent, while she was of royal descent. Her high ancestry made Mary's marriage (like that of her elder sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25157/', "Lady Katherine Seymour")</script>, in 1560) a matter of close interest to the crown. By 19 August the marriage was discovered and the couple were closely interrogated. Keys was sent to the Fleet, while Mary was committed to the care of Mr William Hawtrey. For the next two years Mary stayed at his house, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire, from where she addressed letters to Cecil and Leicester, begging them to intercede with the queen to secure her pardon. Keys meanwhile prepared a petition offering to renounce his wife, but Bishop Grindal of London refused to annul the marriage and referred the matter to the court of arches. In August 1567 Mary was sent to live at the house of her stepgrandmother Katherine Willoughby, dowager duchess of Suffolk. She stayed there until June 1569, when she was removed to the house of Sir Thomas Gresham, who evidently disliked her presence. From 1570 onwards Gresham kept petitioning for her removal &#145;for the quyetness of my powre wiffe and my howsses&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/85, fol. 1).<br>
<br>After several years Elizabeth's anger at the marriage was spent. Although she refused to allow the couple to cohabit, she allowed Keys to leave prison in 1568 and eventually to return to Kent, where he died in 1571. Mary asked permission to wear mourning clothes, and used her married name for the first time. In 1572 Elizabeth agreed that Mary was &#145;att free leberty&#146; to live where she pleased, but Mary had nowhere to go. She complained that she was &#145;destetud of all friends&#146; and had insufficient income to live independently  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/85, fol. 216). She therefore stayed an unwanted guest with Gresham until she went to live with her stepfather in 1573. Some time afterwards she set up her own household in a house near Aldersgate, London, where she died on 20 April 1578. During the last year of her life she occasionally attended court and exchanged new year's gifts with the queen.<br>
<br>Mary was probably buried in Westminster Abbey alongside her mother. In her will she left her possessions to friends and kinswomen. The lease of her house was to be sold for the benefit of her god-daughter Mary Merrick. An inventory of her books reveals an interest in theology. She possessed not only three bibles (including the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>) and John Knox's <span class="italic">Answer to a Great Number of Blasphemous Cavillations</span> (1560), but also works relating to the Admonition controversy of the early 1570s, concerning the government and further reformation of the Church of England. Less surprisingly, she also owned Foxe's book of martyrs.<br>
