<span class="headword">Lackington,  George</span>  (1777&#150;1844), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born in London on 30 December 1777 and baptized at St James's, Westminster, on 22 January 1778, the son of Charles Lackington, a thriving coal merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Street. He was third cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15843/', "James Lackington (1746&#150;1815)")</script>, bookseller and publisher. His father purchased a share in James Lackington's business for his son, and at the age of thirteen George, who was &#145;well educated and gentlemanly&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.51b), began work in the bookshop which was then located at Chiswell Street, London. When in 1794 the firm moved to the building in Finsbury Square known as the Temple of the Muses, it was a very successful business which dealt in cheap remaindered books sold for cash, and at the height of its prosperity was said to employ more than 100 people. When James Lackington retired in 1798, George was made head of the firm, which became known as Lackington, Allen &amp; Co.<br>
<br>By 1803 Lackington, Allen &amp; Co. were also considerable publishers: one of their advertisements lists forty-three items including their latest &#145;Catalogue of Ancient and Modern Books, comprising upwards of 800,000 volumes, the largest collection for sale in Europe&#146;. Their sales list for the same year had widened to include classical texts and contemporary writers such as Tobias Smollett. The list also includes William Turton's <span class="italic">Medical Glossary</span> (Turton was a relative of James Lackington by marriage), and William Fordyce Mavor's <span class="italic">Natural History</span> (Mavor's son became one of the partners of the firm).<br>
<br>On 18 March 1805 George Lackington married Eliza Bullock, daughter of Captain Bullock RN. They had three daughters and two sons, born between 1806 and 1818. Between 1815 and 1817 Lackington, Allen &amp; Co. suffered losses amounting to &pound;2198 under the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> which, in an amendment of 1814, contentiously required the deposit of eleven copies of new publications in certain libraries. Lackington's correspondence with Sir Egerton Brydges, MP for Maidstone, who was attempting to bring in reforms to the act, was printed in Brydges's pamphlet <span class="italic">Reasons for a Further Amendment of &hellip; the Copyright Act of Queen Anne</span> (1817). It also contains letters Lackington exchanged with James Bean, assistant keeper of printed books in the British Museum. Lackington, Allen &amp; Co. were publishing a number of expensive works in parts by subscription, several of which had commenced before 1814 (notably Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>), and they were unwilling to supply the earliest parts. In 1815 Lackington was forced to comply with a demand from the British Museum.<br>
<br>By 1822 the business was conducted under the name Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, and Lepard. Joseph Harding was one of the early partners who had served his apprenticeship with his father, John Harding, agricultural bookseller of St James's Street. In 1825 George Lackington bought from William Bullock Egyptian Hall, situated at 170&#150;71 Piccadilly, which housed Bullock's Museum. In 1831 he turned part of the building into an exhibition hall (it was demolished in 1905) and in 1832 withdrew from involvement in it.<br>
<br>After Lackington's retirement the firm moved to Pall Mall East and was known as Harding and Lepard. Lackington, who always had a facility for financial affairs, was in later years, according to Nichols, an official assignee of bankrupts. Lackington died on 31 March 1844 at his home in Circus Road, St John's Wood, London, and was buried in a family vault at Kensal Green cemetery. The last link with Lackington ended in December 1886 with the death of James Kanes Ford, who had worked for Lackington until 1821, when he left to set up his own bookselling business in London at Upper Street, Islington.<br>
