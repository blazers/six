<span class="headword">Penrose,  Edith Elura Tilton</span>  (1914&#150;1996), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 29 November 1914 at Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, the daughter of George Albert Tilton, a civil engineer involved in road construction, and his wife, Hazel Sparling, a descendant of a passenger on the <i>Mayflower</i>. She had two brothers, Harvey and Jack, both of whom were killed during military service, in 1952 and 1945 respectively. For a time she was brought up in road camps along the highway which her father surveyed, but the family eventually settled in the tiny Californian town of St Luis Obispo, where she went to school. She then studied at the University of California at Berkeley, graduating AB in economics in 1936. Her first job after graduating was in social work with an agency for depression relief. In 1934 she had married a lawyer, David Burton Denhardt, and in 1938 she was expecting their first child (a son) when Denhardt was killed in a mysterious hunting accident. In 1939 she began to work with Ernest Francis (Pen) Penrose (1896&#150;1984), a distinguished economist who had been her professor at Berkeley, at the International Labour Organization in Geneva. She worked there as a researcher in the economics section of the organization, and her work on the food problems in wartime Britain gave rise to her first book, <span class="italic">Food Control in Great Britain</span> (1940). Fearing a German invasion, the organization moved to Montreal in mid-1940, but in March 1941 John Winant, the deputy director, who had initially brought Pen to Geneva, was appointed American ambassador to Britain. Pen joined him in London as economic adviser, and Edith joined his staff as a special assistant; they remained in London throughout the war, and married on 27 October 1944. They had three sons, one of whom died as a young child.<br>
<br>The Penroses followed Winant back to the United States in 1946 to serve under him on the US delegation to the newly formed United Nations. After Winant's death in 1947 they moved first to Princeton, and then to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where Pen took a chair in human geography and Edith began her postgraduate studies in economics. Her doctoral thesis was supervised by the eminent neo-classical economist, Fritz Machlup, and was published as <span class="italic">The Economics of the International Patent System</span> (1951). This was the turning point in Edith Penrose's career. Through her doctoral research work and a subsequent research project involving fieldwork at the Hercules Powder Company, she became an industrial economist. Her major work, <span class="italic">The Theory of the Growth of the Firm</span> (1959), was the product of these endeavours. Her approach differed fundamentally from the prevailing micro-economic, neo-classical paradigm, in that it attached great importance to observing the world. Theory, she argued, was necessary to understand a complex reality, but should not be developed in isolation from that reality. For Penrose, the firm is a set of productive resources &#145;under administrative co-ordination for the production of goods and services for sale in the market for a profit&#146;  (Penrose and Pitelis, 9). The distinction between firm and market lies in the boundary: economic activity inside the firm is carried on within an administrative organization, while economic activity in the market is not. Growth is endogenous to the firm. The firm is defined in terms of resources (including managerial) which are not inputs but provide services which are themselves inputs, while neo-classical theory defines the firm in terms of outputs produced at the minimum point of the average cost curve. According to Penrose, the incentive to grow is attributed to the inevitable emergence of unused managerial resources after an expansion plan has been completed. &#145;Unused productive services are, for the enterprising firm, at the same time a challenge to innovate, an incentive to expand, and a source of competitive advantage&#146;  (ibid., 11). The book had a tremendous impact both on the theory of the firm, and, by extension, on issues of strategic management.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1950s Penrose was a lecturer and research associate at Johns Hopkins, but when she and Pen defended their colleague Owen Lattimore against Senator McCarthy's committee on unAmerican activities, they found it more congenial to leave the United States. Penrose then spent 1955&#150;6 in Canberra as a visiting professor at the Australian National University, and 1957&#150;9 as an associate professor at Baghdad University. At the latter she acquired the strong interest in the Middle East which bore fruit in her work on international oil companies. However, she never learned Arabic, and despite her affection for the region she had no deep understanding of its peoples and their culture. In 1960 Pen had reached retirement age, and they both returned to England, where, on the strength of her recently published <span class="italic">Theory of the Growth of the Firm</span>, Edith Penrose was appointed to a readership in economics at the London School of Economics and the School of Oriental and African Studies. In 1964 the latter established a chair of economics with special reference to Asia, which she held until 1978, and she also chaired the newly established economics department for some years. Her major empirical work at this time was on oil companies, <span class="italic">The Large International Firm in Developing Countries: the International Petroleum Industry</span> (1968). In her work in this area she was among the first to discover the phenomenon of transfer pricing and its implications for tax optimization. To make the most of opportunities that reduce fiscal liabilities is a central feature of the multinational corporation's behaviour. The economic implications of this behaviour for oil markets and prices are wide-ranging; Penrose opened a field in which much research remained to be done.<br>
<br>On retiring from London University, Penrose moved to a different type of institution, INSEAD, the management school at Fontainebleau, France, where she was professor of political economy and associate dean for research and development. In a sense this took her back to the field where she had made her most significant and original intellectual contribution: the management of firms. At INSEAD she received belated and well-deserved recognition, whereas the time spent at the School of Oriental and African Studies and her work on economic development were perhaps a digression. Pen's death in 1984 had a profound impact on her, and she decided to retire to Waterbeach, Cambridge, to be near her son. She continued to lead an active professional life, sitting on boards and committees, acting as a consultant and expert witness, and contributing important articles to the economic literature. She died at her home, 30A Station Road, Waterbeach, from heart failure, on 11 October 1996.<br>
<br>Edith Penrose was petite, good-looking, extremely kind to those who needed her support, and very sharp with those she thought were able to take it. Not all were. She nevertheless won the affection and admiration of many who valued the independence of her mind and her indifference to social status and pretensions. She was a liberal in the substantive, not the romantic, meaning of the term. She was suspicious of any concentration of power, political or economic, and stood firm in defence of cherished values. She and Pen helped Jewish refugees in Switzerland in 1940, and their defence of Lattimore against McCarthy obliged them to leave the United States. She used to say, quoting John Winant, &#145;the important thing is to lose your illusions and not become disillusioned&#146;. This was the motto of her life.<br>
