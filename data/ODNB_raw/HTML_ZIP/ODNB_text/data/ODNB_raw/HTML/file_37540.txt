<span class="headword">Boreham,  Hervey  of</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1228?, <em>d.</em> 1277), <span class="occ">administrator and justice</span>, was probably born some time before 1228 in the village of Boreham in Essex, the son of Ralph, son of William of Boreham, a minor landowner. He had at least one brother, named John. His first appearance in surviving records appears to be late in 1249, when he was appointed the abbot of Westminster's attorney for litigation in the common bench. He may already by then have become the abbot's steward, a position he is known to have held in 1254, and apparently retained until 1259. In that year he passed into the service of Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1262), as his steward, and went round the earl's estates hearing complaints against the earl's officials.<br>
<br>Although an ordained cleric, Boreham is said by the contemporary chronicler William of Rishanger to have been one of two standard-bearers of the men of London at the battle of Lewes in 1264. After the victory of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1265), he became a king's clerk, and for a few months was one of those in day-to-day control of the royal administration. In Michaelmas term 1264 he was appointed a junior justice of the common bench, and remained a justice of the court until the end of Trinity term 1265. He may not, however, have sat in the final term as he was under sentence of excommunication, possibly for his part in the battle of Lewes.<br>
<br>Boreham's retention of the custody of a number of escheated royal honours in Essex and of Hadleigh Castle (originally granted to him in July 1264) until the end of 1265 or beginning of 1266, and his subsequent association with John de Burgh in June 1266 in the keeping of the peace in the counties of Essex and Hertfordshire, indicate that he successfully negotiated the transition from Montfortian rule to royalist restoration after the battle of Evesham. He may already have been linked by this date with Earl Richard's son, Gilbert, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1295). He was certainly in the earl's service by 1267, when he was one of those who advised him to occupy London in support of the claims of the disinherited, and was given a safe conduct to bring a message from the earl to the king.<br>
<br>Boreham re-entered the king's service in the last month of Henry III's life and in early November 1272 was appointed a baron of the exchequer. In the final years of his life he achieved high office in the church. By 1272 he had become precentor of Hereford Cathedral and a canon of St Paul's; in 1274 he became dean of St Paul's. In 1275 he is said to have been a serious rival to the saintly Thomas de Cantilupe (<i>d</i>. 1282) for the see of Hereford. Boreham probably died a few days before 7 February 1277.<br>
