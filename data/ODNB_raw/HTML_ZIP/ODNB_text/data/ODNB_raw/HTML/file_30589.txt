<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barker, Sir  Herbert Atkinson</span>  (1869&#150;1950), <span class="occ">bone-setter</span>, was born at Southport on 21 April 1869, the only son of Thomas Wildman Barker, solicitor, who became coroner for south-west Lancashire, and his wife, Agnes Atkinson; both parents died while Barker was a schoolboy. After leaving the grammar school at Kirkby Lonsdale and following a short visit to Canada, Barker was apprenticed to his cousin, John Atkinson, a bone-setter, of Park Lane, London, who himself had been taught by the famous Robert Howard Hutton. Atkinson was highly successful, enjoying the patronage of many aristocratic and wealthy patients. In 1889 Barker set up in practice on his own, first in Manchester, then in London, and later in Glasgow. In Manchester he was very successful, helped by referrals from the distinguished surgeon Walter Whitehead. He returned to London again in 1905 and managed at his second attempt to establish himself there. In 1907 he married Jane Ethel Walker, daughter of William Wilson Walker JP. There were no children.<br>
<br>Barker was a controversial figure. He fell foul of members of the medical establishment who were concerned about his lack of formal medical qualifications and who wanted to stop him practising. However, he also had many influential friends, including leading journalists, and a number of newspaper articles appeared in support of &#145;manipulative surgery&#146;, as he styled his bone-setting practices. An article, &#145;What is a quack?&#146;, published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1912, argued that Barker did cure patients, many of whom had failed to obtain relief from qualified doctors. Both W. T. Stead, editor of the <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, and R. D. Blumenfeld, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, wrote robust articles supporting Barker and his claims for recognition as a respectable practitioner. Barker also enjoyed the confidence of his patients, many of whom were public figures. The controversy over his practice reached its height after 1911 when the General Medical Council took action against Dr F. W. Axham for acting as anaesthetist for the unqualified Barker; Axham was removed from the professional register. This case aroused further public support for Barker, who also gained sympathy in 1917 when the refusal of his offer to treat soldiers was discussed in parliament. The government eventually conceded that individuals might consult an unqualified person but only on their own responsibility. By this time many eminent people, including leading medical practitioners, were anxious that Barker's skill should receive appropriate recognition. In 1920 the archbishop of Canterbury was asked to exercise his special powers and award Barker the degree of MD, Lambeth. However, this would not have &#145;qualified&#146; him because it was not a degree recognized by the General Medical Council for registration. Finally, Barker was knighted in 1922. Following his retirement from regular practice soon afterwards, he spent much of his time on the continent and in the Channel Islands.<br>
<br>The animosity of the medical profession gradually died down. In 1936 Lord Moynihan suggested to the British Orthopaedic Association that Barker should be invited to demonstrate his techniques. A special meeting was held at St Thomas's Hospital, London, and the cases were later reported by Walter Rowley Bristow, a leading orthopaedic surgeon, in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, on 27 February 1937. Later, films were made at St Thomas's of Barker at work. Although he was never accepted as a conventional orthopaedic surgeon, he was held in great respect by many practitioners who were working hard during the 1920s and 1930s to establish orthopaedics as a speciality of high status. Bristow and many of his colleagues in the British Orthopaedic Association came to recognize the value of Barker's manipulative techniques and had great sympathy with his emphasis on treating patients &#145;holistically&#146;. In 1941 Barker was elected manipulative surgeon to Noble's Hospital in the Isle of Man.<br>
<br>There had been many bone-setters before Barker, but none so eminent. His name became a household word, due in part to the reporting of his squabble with the medical profession, though this antagonism had been aroused, in part at least, because of the considerable professional reputation he had achieved. The secret of Barker's remarkable success was that in spite of being unqualified he had a gift for healing. He also had a strong personality, believing firmly in himself, and exuding confidence. He willed his patients back to normal life and did not cease treating them until they were cured. Long experience taught him which patients were unlikely to respond to his methods, and his medical friends (of whom he had many) were inundated with patients, mostly incurable, referred by him.<br>
<br>Barker died in the Royal Infirmary, Lancaster, on 21 July 1950; his wife survived him.<br>
