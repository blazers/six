<span class="headword">Barclay,  Andrew Whyte</span>  (1817&#150;1884), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 21 July 1817 in Dysart, Fife, the son of Lieutenant John Barclay, a naval officer, and Henrietta Whyte. He was educated at the high school, Edinburgh, and began studying medicine at Edinburgh University in 1834. In 1836&#150;7 he visited London and studied at the Westminster Hospital. He also visited Berlin and Paris before returning to Edinburgh, where he gained his MD in 1839. He then continued travelling and visited Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy, and Madeira. After his return to England he entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1842; he proceeded MD in 1852. He also studied at St George's Hospital, London, and was appointed medical registrar there, a post which he held for many years.<br>
<br>Barclay became the first medical officer of health for Chelsea in 1855. His <span class="italic">Progress of Preventive Medicine and Sanitary Measures</span> appeared in 1856. He was elected assistant physician to St George's Hospital in 1857, and he paid particular attention to the interests of the medical school, where he lectured on medicine. He served as physician from 1862 to 1882. He married the eldest daughter of a Dr Noble in 1864. Henry Noble Barclay (1866&#150;1939) was their son.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Physicians Barclay became a fellow in 1851, and he was examiner in medicine, councillor, censor, Lumleian lecturer, and Harveian orator (for 1881); he was elected treasurer in 1884. He was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society for the year 1881, and he contributed to the transactions of that society two papers on heart disease. Barclay was shrewd and cautious as a physician, and concise and polished as a writer. He wrote <span class="italic">A Manual of Medical Diagnosis</span> (1857), <span class="italic">On Medical Errors</span>, and <span class="italic">On Gout and Rheumatism in Relation to Diseases of the Heart</span> (1866).<br>
<br>Barclay retired to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, in 1882, and was also appointed consulting physician at St George's Hospital in London. He died on 28 April 1884 at Whitney Wood, Stevenage.<br>
