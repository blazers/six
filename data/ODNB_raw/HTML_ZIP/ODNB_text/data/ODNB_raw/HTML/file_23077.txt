<span class="headword">Ramsay,  Andrew Michael</span> <span class="st"> [Jacobite Sir Andrew Ramsay, baronet]</span>  (1686&#150;1743), <span class="occ">philosopher and Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was born in Ayr in 1686, probably on 29 May, the son of Andrew Ramsay (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;<i>c</i>.1740) and his wife, Susanna. His father, a baker and burgess of the town of Ayr, was a staunch Calvinist; his mother was an Anglican. Ramsay was educated at the grammar school in Ayr and later described himself as having shown an early interest in study and the sciences. From the age of fifteen he was so taken with mathematics that he would spend twelve hours a day, without eating or drinking, in learning the calculus. With his mother's encouragement, he soon rejected the &#145;Dogme affreux de la predestination&#146;  (Biblioth&egrave;que M&eacute;janes, MS 1188, p. 4). On his deathbed he recalled that his deep sense of piety at this time manifested itself in hours spent at prayer in a ruined Roman Catholic church. He entered Edinburgh University, perhaps with the intention of studying for the Episcopalian ministry, and seems also to have attended lectures in theology at Glasgow University. At the age of nineteen he encountered at Edinburgh a sceptical Episcopalian doctor who taught him the virtues of toleration and encouraged him to be critical of established religion. He abandoned his plans for a career in the Scottish Episcopal church and was at first drawn to deism, eventually discovering an interest in the mysticism of Madame Bourignon and, later, of Madame Guyon. Ramsay did not undertake this spiritual journey alone. He conversed and corresponded throughout this period with George Cheyne, James Cunningham, George and James Garden, Robert Keith, Lord Deskford of Cullen, and Lord Forbes of Pitsligo. This circle of friends, with whom Ramsay remained in contact for many years, constituted a distinct group of educated followers of mystical theology, several of them based in the north-east of Scotland, whose leanings were towards nonjuring and even Jacobitism.<br>
<br>Ramsay's first employment came from another Scottish follower of Madame Bourignon, Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall, but he soon moved to the service of the earl of Wemyss as tutor to his two children. This took Ramsay to London towards the end of 1708 and drew him closer to the world of the Jacobite nobility. Under the influence of James Keith, Ramsay took an interest in the Philadelphian movement and corresponded extensively with his Scottish friends about the activities of the French Prophets, both in London and Edinburgh. Ramsay was introduced to the Prophets by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, who taught him mathematics for a time. He decided, however, to quit London and travel to the Netherlands in spring 1710. Encouraged by Scottish friends who were already in residence there, Ramsay settled briefly at Rijnsburg, the village between Leiden and The Hague which was the home of Madame Bourignon's disciple Pierre Poiret. At Leiden Ramsay attended some of Boerhaave's lectures, but he soon accepted Poiret's advice that he should travel to Cambrai to study with Archbishop F&eacute;nelon. Like Madame Bourignon or Madame Guyon, F&eacute;nelon preached the doctrine of disinterested love, but, unlike them, he encouraged his protestant pupils to convert to Catholicism. Ramsay arrived at Cambrai in August 1710 and embarked on six months of spiritual debate and confession, during the course of which he was received by F&eacute;nelon into the Catholic church.<br>
<br>Some time before F&eacute;nelon's death in 1715, Ramsay had moved with his encouragement to Blois, where he served as secretary to Madame Guyon herself, in particular maintaining a correspondence with her Scottish disciples. Towards the end of 1716, however, he had moved to Paris, where he served as governor to the son of the comte de Sassenage, and began to become acquainted with the Jacobite court in exile and with the Benedictines of Scots College. He was devastated by the death of Madame Guyon, which he reported to his friends in Scotland. Ramsay's <span class="italic">Life of F&eacute;nelon</span>, which was published in French and in an English translation by Nathaniel Hooke in 1723, contained an extensive account of Madame Guyon as well as the story of his own conversion, and was in part a response to Poiret's edition of her autobiography (1720). By this time Ramsay had already published a discourse on epic poetry, extolling F&eacute;nelon's composition <span class="italic">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span>, which was printed with a new edition of that poem in 1717, as well as an <span class="italic">Essay philosophique sur le gouvernement civil</span> (1721), according to F&eacute;nelon's principles, which was rapidly translated into English and appeared in editions at both London and Edinburgh in 1722. In the <span class="italic">Essay</span> Ramsay praised the virtues of monarchy, condemned rebellion, and argued that the proper practice of love for one's neighbour and one's self would overcome the danger of political revolution, which was caused by an excessive love of power on the part of rulers or of independence on the part of their subjects.<br>
<br>Ramsay's service with the comte de Sassenage terminated in September 1722. His friends arranged a pension for him from the abbey of Signy and his appointment as a chevalier of the ordre de Saint-Lazare on 20 May 1723. Through his acquaintance with the duke of Mar and with Lord Lansdowne, Ramsay was eventually able to find permanent employment with the Jacobite court. He was called to become tutor to the young prince, Charles Edward, in December 1723 and travelled to Rome in that capacity early in 1724. However, disunity and political intrigue in the Jacobite court at Rome soon led Ramsay to seek permission to return to Paris. The Old Pretender at this time described him as &#145;an odd body &hellip; yet I will be charitable enough to think him a madd man&#146;  (Henderson, <span class="italic">Chevalier Ramsay</span>, 106&#150;7), and he did not rejoin the royal household. Instead Ramsay forged a literary career, in particular through the publication of <span class="italic">Les voyages de Cyrus</span> (1727), dedicated to his new patron, the duc de Sully, which was again translated into English by Hooke. In both its French and English editions Ramsay's <span class="italic">Cyrus</span> was a sensation. Deeply indebted to F&eacute;nelon's example, it told the story of Cyrus's adventures among the magi and the Greeks, drawing heavily on the tradition of a pristine ancient wisdom akin to Christianity, and arguing for the existence of three states of humanity: the innocent, the fallen, and the restored. It attacked the ideas of Spinoza and upheld the existence of a subtle fluid, through whose actions God produces physical effects. It also hinted at a doctrine of metempsychosis. In its pages Ramsay attempted to reconcile the philosophy of Descartes with that of Newton in a mystical Christian context.<br>
<br>In the wake of his success and at the request of English Catholics, Ramsay undertook a journey to London in 1729. In December he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; he was also chosen as a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society, and on 10 April 1730 received the degree of DCL from Oxford University, where William King promoted his cause. He was, however, disappointed in his hope of meeting Jonathan Swift, whose writings had &#145;prepared [him] for relishing those principles of universal religion&#146;  (Ramsay to Swift, BL, Add. MS 4805, fols. 188&#150;9). On his return to France Ramsay entered the service of the family of de Bouillon as a tutor, and moved to live first at Andresy and then at Pontoise. He was created a baronet in the Jacobite peerage on 23 March 1735. Although he was disappointed in his desire to become a member of the Acad&eacute;mie he continued to publish widely. The most substantial of his works, the <span class="italic">Histoire du vicomte de Turenne</span>, which was based on extensive documentation that Ramsay printed, appeared in 1735, and celebrated the career of one of the heroes of the family that employed him. Its translation into English led to the falling out of Ramsay and Hooke.<br>
<br>In common with several of his Catholic Jacobite friends Ramsay became a leading figure in French freemasonry, as a member of the Lodge St Thomas. In 1737 he delivered <span class="italic">A Discourse Pronounced at the Reception of Freemasons</span>, which stressed the order's desire to unify humanity through the love of virtue, and argued that freemasonry had originated during the crusades. In June 1735 Ramsay married Marie (1701&#150;<i>c</i>.1761), daughter of Sir David Nairne and his wife, Marie-Elizabeth de Compigny. Ramsay and his wife had a son, who died in infancy, and a daughter. In his last years he moved to St Germain-en-Laye, where he was nursed by his wife. He died there on 6 May 1743 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> and was buried the following day in the parish church; his heart was entombed at the convent of the Sisters of the Holy Sacrament, rue Casette, in Paris. On his deathbed Ramsay dictated &#145;Anecdotes&#146; of his life, but he left unpublished his great work, <span class="italic">The Philosophical Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion</span>. His widow succeeded in placing the book with the Foulis brothers in Glasgow and it eventually appeared in two volumes in 1748&#150;9. It reiterated many of the arguments of Ramsay's <span class="italic">Cyrus</span>, but made more explicit his attempt to reconcile Newtonian ideas to his own philosophy.<br>
