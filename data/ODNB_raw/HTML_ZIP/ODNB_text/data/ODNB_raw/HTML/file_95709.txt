<span class="headword">Davies,  (Albert) Meredith</span>  (1922&#150;2005), <span class="occ">organist and conductor</span>, was born on 30 July 1922 at 27 Beresford Road, Upton, Birkenhead, Cheshire, the second son of Elias Aaron Davies, Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Norah Annie Margaretta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parry. At the age of eight he became a junior exhibitioner at the Royal College of Music as a cellist. Showing aptitude for the organ, he was taken as a pupil by the organist George Thalben-Ball. In 1936 he was admitted as a fellow of the Royal College of Organists, then in 1941 he went as an organ scholar to Keble College, Oxford. Called up in 1942, during the Second World War, he served for three years in the Royal Artillery, before returning to Oxford after the war to complete his degree, graduating with a second-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1947.<br>
<br>Davies, appointed organist and choirmaster at St Albans Cathedral in 1947, was married there on 29 January 1949 to Betty Hazel, the 21-year-old daughter of Kenneth Leslie Bates. There were four children of the marriage, three sons and a daughter. Later in 1949 he moved to Hereford Cathedral where, as well as his duties as organist, he conducted at the Three Choirs festivals of 1952 and 1955. Encouraged by Sir Adrian Boult to become a full-time conductor, Davies took courses at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome during 1954 and 1956, before leaving Hereford to become organist at New College, Oxford, a post from which he resigned in 1959. Meanwhile he was conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra (1957&#150;60) and the City of Birmingham Choir (1957&#150;64).<br>
<br>Davies had a particular affinity with the work of Benjamin Britten. A performance of Britten's <span class="italic">Spring Symphony</span> in 1960 led to the composer's inviting Davies to conduct with the English Opera Group (EOG) at the Aldeburgh festival. During the next five years Davies conducted many of Britten's operas with the EOG, on tour, at Aldeburgh, and at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. These included <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucretia</span>, <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span>, and <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span>. Davies made a very successful Covent Garden d&eacute;but in November 1960, conducting Britten's <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span>; his handling of the big choral scenes won particular praise. In July 1961 he gave the North American premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> in Vancouver, then conducted the Covent Garden production of the opera at the Edinburgh festival and in London. Davies had perhaps his greatest triumph in May 1962 when he conducted the main orchestra, choir, and soprano soloist (Heather Harper, who had had only ten days in which to learn her part) at the premi&egrave;re of Britten's <span class="italic">War Requiem</span> in the newly built Coventry Cathedral; Britten, who had been expected to conduct the whole work, instead conducted the chamber orchestra accompanying the tenor and baritone soloists. Davies also conducted the triumphant first performance of the work in Westminster Abbey in December 1962. Britten had complete confidence in Davies's skill as a conductor and his interpretation of his works.<br>
<br>Also in 1962 Davies conducted Delius's <span class="italic">A Village Romeo and Juliet</span> for Sadler's Wells Opera; the South American premi&egrave;re, in Buenos Aires, of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>; and <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span> for the EOG at the Edinburgh festival. During 1963 he conducted a new production of <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> for Sadler's Wells, which the company took to Germany, and Poulenc's <span class="italic">Dialogues des carm&eacute;lites</span> at Covent Garden. At the 1964 Aldeburgh festival he conducted the premi&egrave;re of Malcolm Williamson's <span class="italic">English Eccentrics</span>, based on the book by Edith Sitwell. Other composers with whose work Davies became associated included Ralph Vaughan Williams (Davies's recordings of his <span class="italic">Riders to the Sea</span> and <span class="italic">Sir John in Love</span> were highly acclaimed), Anthony Milner, Alan Bush, and Jonathan Harvey.<br>
<br>In September 1964 EOG made a historic tour of the Soviet Union, visiting Riga, Leningrad, and Moscow. During the tour Davies began a five-year relationship with Cara Lancaster, a stage manager for EOG, with whom he had two children, a son and a daughter. Davies, who had been appointed conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, travelled to Canada directly from Russia. He returned to Britain several times during his seven years in Vancouver: in 1965 to conduct Britten's <span class="italic">Billy Budd</span> at Covent Garden; in 1967 to conduct the premi&egrave;re of Lennox Berkeley's <span class="italic">Castaway</span> at Aldeburgh; and in 1969 to take the EOG's <span class="italic">Midsummer Night's Dream</span> to the Flanders festival and to conduct <span class="italic">English Eccentrics</span> for the London Opera Centre.<br>
<br>Davies was appointed conductor of the Royal Choral Society in 1972, and the same year joined the teaching staff of the Royal College of Music. He continued to conduct opera from time to time, including the London premi&egrave;re of Alexander Goehr's <span class="italic">Arden Must Die</span>, given by the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells, and Puccini's <span class="italic">La rondine</span>, presented by the EOG at the same theatre, both in 1974. He conducted <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span> for English Music Theatre (successor to the EOG) at the 1976 Brighton festival and in 1980 took over <span class="italic">Mary, Queen of Scots</span> from the composer, Thea Musgrave, when she became ill and was unable to conduct it for Scottish Opera. In 1979 Davies was appointed principal of Trinity College of Music, London, where he remained until 1988, inaugurating an opera group at the college, which gave yearly performances at the Bloomsbury Theatre; he also worked with the London Schools Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed CBE in 1982.<br>
<br>On retirement Davies went to live in Alresford, Hampshire. He was chairman of the Delius Society from 1991 to 1997; a great admirer of Delius, he made fine recordings of his operas <span class="italic">A Village Romeo and Juliet</span> and <span class="italic">Fennimore and Gerda</span>. He died at his home, 10 Mallard Close, New Alresford, on 9 March 2005, of congestive cardiac failure. A memorial service was held in St Albans Cathedral on 2 October 2005, and the students of Trinity College performed the <span class="italic">War Requiem</span> in his memory at Rochester, Southwark, and Brighton in March 2006. He was survived by his wife, Betty, two sons, and two daughters, one son from his marriage and the son from his relationship with Cara Lancaster having predeceased him.<br>
