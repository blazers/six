<span class="headword">Fancourt,  Samuel</span>  (1678&#150;1768), <span class="occ">librarian and Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Oakham, Rutland, one of the four boys and two girls of Richard Fancourt, a prosperous merchant, and Anne Tresham. He was educated at the dissenting academy in Hungerford, Berkshire, under Benjamin Robinson and was ordained minister on 24 May 1709. He had married Martha Clempson on 5 August 1706 in Hungerford and remained there until 1715 or 1716, when he moved to become minister of Wilton, 3 miles west of Salisbury. In 1721 he moved to Salisbury and settled in the Dolphin Chequer, but subsequently moved to Salt Lane, where he lived from 1723 to 1742.<br>
<br>In 1735 Fancourt &#145;contrived a Circulating Library for the Entertainment of distant as well as home Subscribers&#146;  (Fancourt, 4). This was an innovative but over-ambitious venture which aimed to supply a wide range of books and pamphlets for a fee of a half-guinea a year, plus 5<i>s</i>. for delivery, within a 60 miles radius of Salisbury. In late 1741 or early 1742 he issued a catalogue advertising books in English and French of his New Circulary Library at Salisbury, but the library proved uneconomical: &#145;at Salisbury they would yield nothing&#146;, as he later described it  (ibid., 5). He and his wife moved their possessions and a 5000 volume circulating library on wagons to London and settled at 6 Crane Court, off Fleet Street, in late 1742. From here he recommenced his business as the First Universal Circulating Library, which was succeeded by the Second Universal Circulating Library (1745&#150;50), and finally the Associated Circulating Library (1750&#150;<i>c</i>.1760). From 1746 to 1748 he issued in parts a comprehensive two-volume library catalogue, which listed the books, in English, French, and Latin, alphabetically and included a subject index.<br>
<br>Fancourt's home was adjacent to the Royal Society, and while this proximity was good for business it brought him into direct conflict with the powerful secretary to the society, Dr Cromwell Mortimer. A physician notorious for charging high fees, he had treated Martha Fancourt and published an account of her illness with his <span class="italic">Address to the public: containing narratives of the effects of certain chemical remedies in most diseases</span> in 1745. This, coupled with Mortimer's interference in Fancourt's library, caused great difficulties in his library until Mortimer's death in 1752. As a fellow Presbyterian, Mortimer was one of several fellows of the Royal Society who were included in the original deed of trust of the library, yet he soon meddled in the library's affairs by criticizing Fancourt's management and by using his considerable influence for negative purposes, which made a business that was of doubtful viability even more precarious. In 1760 Fancourt and his wife retired to Hoxton Square, Shoreditch, London&#151;a pleasant area popular with dissenters and home to a dissenting academy, the Hoxton Independent Academy&#151;and he died there on 8 June 1768. He was buried in Bunhill Fields.<br>
<br>Fancourt was a resolute, innovative librarian who provided &#145;the link between the Clerical Subscription Libraries of the 17th and 18th centuries and the secular subscription libraries and book clubs of later times&#146;  (Kelly, 146). A tenacious theologian and author of eighteen books and pamphlets published between 1720 and 1745, Fancourt debated such complex theological questions as &#145;the Doctrine of Reprobation&#146;, &#145;Divine Prescience&#146;, and the &#145;Freedom of Will&#146; both within the Presbyterian church and outside. These doctrinal debates were described as &#145;swelling into so many Volumes that no Head can compass it&#146; and brought him into conflict with Bishop Benjamin Hoadly of Salisbury. It was librarianship, however, that became his primary vocation, and he devised schemes for the delivery of library services both in Salisbury and in London and produced library catalogues that were far ahead of his time and not bettered until the following century.<br>
