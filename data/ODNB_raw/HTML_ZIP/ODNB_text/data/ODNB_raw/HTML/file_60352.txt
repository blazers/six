<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies,  (William) Robertson</span>  (1913&#150;1995), <span class="occ">novelist and university teacher</span>, was born on 28 August 1913 in Elizabeth Street, Thamesville, Ontario, the third of the three sons of (William) Rupert Davies (1879&#150;1967), newspaper publisher and broadcaster, and Florence McKay (1870&#150;1948). His father had arrived in Canada from his native Wales, penniless but determined to flourish as a printer, first in the rural village of Thamesville in south-western Ontario. So successful was Rupert Davies that in time he became the owner of several Ontario newspapers, a partner with Roy Thomson (later Lord Thomson of Fleet) in radio and television stations, a Liberal senator, and the owner of a large Victorian pile in south Wales to which he frequently retreated with unfailing enthusiasm. Robertson Davies remained grateful to his affluent father throughout his life, but relations with his mother, nine years older than her husband, were never easy. Florence McKay, a descendant of united empire loyalists who had made their way, with great hardship, to the wilderness of Upper Canada following the American War of Independence, appeared to her three sons as frequently cantankerous, caustic, and distant. It was a troubled relationship that Davies was to explore in his novels.<br>
<br>Placed in Canada's leading boys' school, Upper Canada College, by his increasingly prosperous father, Davies soon demonstrated a love for the theatre, happily participating in student productions there and later at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and at Balliol College, Oxford (where he also joined enthusiastically in college music with Edward Heath). Throughout the 1930s, during his school and university years, Davies sought in drama the fulfilment of his mounting literary ambitions, studying and writing about the English theatre of the eighteenth and especially the nineteenth century and, in Oxford and London, collaborating with his dynamic wife-to-be, the Australian Brenda Mathews (<i>b</i>. 1917). During their subsequent two years at the Old Vic, Tyrone Guthrie, who became a lifelong friend, saw in Robertson Davies a valued literary assistant and a likely Shakespearian actor and in Brenda Mathews a highly competent&#151;and his first female&#151;stage manager. Brenda Mathews and Robertson Davies married on 2 February 1940, but the war effectively ended their still uncertain theatrical prospects in Britain. Rejected by the Canadian army because of his weak eyesight&#151;it was not for nothing that he had affected a monocle during his more flamboyant days at Oxford&#151;Davies sought the safety of Ontario, where a fledgeling career in journalism awaited him. There he wrote regularly for two of his father's provincial newspapers. A tireless reader since schooldays, he soon became the literary editor of the national periodical <span class="italic">Saturday Night</span> and, at his father's invitation, editor of the <span class="italic">Peterborough Examiner</span>. Wartime Peterborough, 135 kilometres north-east of Toronto, with a population in 1940 of no more than 25,000, was unappreciative of&#151;if not faintly hostile towards&#151;the intellectual attainments and literary imagination of both Brenda and Robertson Davies. The small-town Ontario experience did, however, lead to Davies's first books, two collections of his provocative and frequently comic &#145;Samuel Marchbanks&#146; columns from the <span class="italic">Examiner</span>. Such were their quality that they induced Roy Thomson to offer him the editorship of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>.<br>
<br>Following the end of the Second World War, Davies continued as literary editor of <span class="italic">Saturday Night</span>, while writing reviews and articles for the <span class="italic">Kingston Whig Standard</span> and the <span class="italic">Peterborough Examiner</span>. All the while he continued to help foster with Brenda the modest theatrical life of Ontario. He offered a series of short plays to the annual dominion drama festival, but they challenged Canada's uncertain post-war self-perceptions and were largely unsuccessful despite their easy way with fantasy and humour. Davies's own lack of success as a dramatist did not, however, diminish his commitment to the theatre. He made a major contribution to the launch of the highly successful annual Shakespearian festival in Stratford, Ontario, not far from his birthplace, a festival presided over by his old friend Sir Tyrone Guthrie.<br>
<br>In 1951, increasingly impatient at the continuing cool reception given his plays in Canada and at the Edinburgh festival in 1949, Davies, then aged thirty-eight, attempted his first novel, <span class="italic">Tempest-Tost</span>. Finally free of the frustrating dependence on cast and producers, he adopted his new literary form with enthusiasm, letting his imagination in <span class="italic">Tempest-Tost</span> re-create his undergraduate days at Queen's University&#151;and his tense relations with his difficult mother&#151;while offering a memorable and highly amusing account of a bungled student production of Shakespeare's late play. Theatre and, eventually, opera were never distant from his novels. His next two, <span class="italic">Leaven of Malice</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">A Mixture of Frailties</span> (1958), soon completed the Salterton trilogy, the first of several trilogies. (Davies later maintained that he had never intended to write trilogies: he simply had more to say about the varied experience and understanding of his principal characters than he could encompass in a single volume.) Davies always wrote rapidly. Drawing on his experience as editor of the <span class="italic">Peterborough Examiner</span>, the Salterton trilogy reviewed, in a light-hearted and witty way, the part played by a newspaper in a small Ontario community and the diversity of meaning that subscribers read into newspapers. <span class="italic">Leaven of Malice</span> was awarded the Stephen Leacock prize for humour. <span class="italic">A Mixture of Frailties</span> reflected the growing interest and conviction of both Brenda and Robertson Davies in the teachings of Carl Jung. Like the major characters in Davies's novels, the Davieses were engaged in a quest for greater self-knowledge and were increasingly captivated by what they read of the Swiss psychoanalyst. He was to them satisfyingly optimistic, flexible, and exploitive of legend in a constructive and illuminating way. They embraced his teachings as &#145;both safer and more lastingly effective than Freud's&#146;, which the Davieses had found restrictive  (R. Davies, &#145;The individual and the mass&#146;, <span class="italic">Saturday Night</span>, 24 May 1958, 26). &#145;Jung's thought is very expansive, a sort of opening out of life whereas so much psychoanalytical thinking is reductive&#146;, Davies said  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 4 Dec 1995). His teachings seemed comprehensive, asserting that wholeness in life can be achieved through a process of integration beyond one's own consciousness to embrace that of the traditions and collective consciousness of a whole race. As one who described his writing as having at its centre &#145;the isolation of the human spirit&#146;  (ibid.) in its progress from innocence to experience, Davies came to accept myths as part of the Jungian understanding of archetypes. Myths also contributed to the richness of his juxtaposed comedy and melodrama, realism and illusion. That Davies, by the 1950s, had been heavily influenced by Jung was even more evident in a final play, <span class="italic">General Confession</span>. Although a failure in New York City, it is of significance for the close reader of Davies since it reflects in detail his understanding of Jung's &#145;collective unconscious&#146; and the archetypes that populate it.<br>
<br>By the age of forty-seven Davies had turned decisively from writing plays to writing novels. He knew that he had already achieved much, being recognized, in Canada at least, as an able and witty journalist, a competent playwright, and increasingly as a committed novelist, but not yet more. In a book of essays about reading, <span class="italic">A Voice from the Attic</span> (1960), he extolled &#145;the values of the humanist&#151;curiosity, the free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race &hellip; an informed, rational and intellectually adventurous individuality must take precedence over all else&#146;  (R. Davies, <span class="italic">A Voice from the Attic</span>, 1960, 39). That understanding was to be the bedrock of Davies's novels and more immediately of the literary columns he wrote for the Toronto <span class="italic">Star</span> syndicate. Concurrently, he became a part-time lecturer in drama at Trinity College in the University of Toronto, having completed in 1960 a total of twenty-five years with the <span class="italic">Peterborough Examiner</span>, first as a columnist, then as editor, and later as publisher. The Davies family moved from Peterborough to Toronto with their three daughters when a yet greater involvement in academe arrived in the form of an invitation from Vincent Massey, the former high commissioner for Canada in Britain and later governor-general, to become the first master of Massey College, at the University of Toronto. The college was modelled on Balliol, the beloved Oxford college of both Massey and Davies. As the first master Davies proved an inspired choice, despite criticisms of the penchant he and Massey shared for the traditional trappings of an Oxbridge college and their desire to transpose these to the markedly different terrain of Ontario. The combined experience of Trinity and Massey enriched Davies's subsequent novels, but it also fuelled his critics' charges that he was pretentious and pedantic and preoccupied with cerebral analysis at the expense of emotional understanding. His presence at the university was visually inescapable: no one else had the theatrical appearance of his great silver mane and beard, hats, and capes, all as easily worn as if he were still at the Old Vic.<br>
<br>Davies had long known that criticism is integral to university life and was not unduly distracted from his commitment to create in Massey College a vibrant and productive community, but the price was initially a reduction in the pace of his story-telling. In 1971, ten years after his appointment as master, <span class="italic">Fifth Business</span> was published. It was, to a degree, an autobiographical novel, but it was also heavily informed by his understanding of Jung's psychoanalysis&#151;as were also, to a greater or less extent, all his subsequent novels. <span class="italic">Fifth Business</span> also triggered another trilogy, the Deptford trilogy, named like the Salterton after a fictional Ontario village. It launched the journeys of self-discovery of individuals, corresponding to Jungian archetypes, who were also to people the subsequent <span class="italic">The Manticore</span> (1972), which won the governor-general's award, and <span class="italic">World of Wonders</span> (1975). <span class="italic">Fifth Business</span>, among other matters, deals broadly with the nature of mothers; <span class="italic">The Manticore</span> considers fathers. But the Deptford trilogy as a whole, uneven as it is, embraces much more: the eternal question of what is good and what is evil&#151;or what is God and what is the devil&#151;with the artist as the purveyor of interpretations, analysis, and wonders. For some, the Deptford trilogy, completed in 1975, remains Davies's best work, rich in characterization, elaborate in plot. Certainly its critical and commercial success in the United States brought him continental instead of merely Canadian accolades&#151;and was the beginning of the burgeoning international recognition that was to mark the last two decades of his life (with sales rapidly increasing in Britain as well as in the United States and Canada).<br>
<br>When Davies retired as master of Massey College and ceased teaching at Trinity College in the University of Toronto in 1981, he embarked on what became a third trilogy, completed in 1988, the Cornish trilogy, named after its principal character. <span class="italic">The Rebel Angels</span> (1981), centred in a Canadian university and narrated largely by a female graduate student, draws heavily on Davies's years at the two colleges (as well as a backward glance at Queen's and Balliol). <span class="italic">The Rebel Angels</span> was received with acclaim by critics across North America as, variously, baroque, esoteric, mystical, and whimsical. In Britain, Anthony Burgess greeted it with the observation that &#145;Among Canadian WASP novelists who have remained loyal to the culture of the Commonwealth, Robertson Davies, at age 69, stands out as internationally important and undoubted Nobel material&#146;  (A. Burgess, &#145;Maple leaf Rabelais&#146;, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 4 April 1982, 33). Despite Davies's loyalty to the culture of the Commonwealth, the Booker prize for Commonwealth authors eluded him, as did the Nobel prize for literature. Yet an honorary doctorate from Oxford and his honorary fellowship at Balliol as well as the award of the order of Canada gave him great pleasure. He was also the first Canadian to be made an honorary member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.<br>
<br>The second and third novels of the Cornish trilogy, <span class="italic">What's Bred in the Bone</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">The Lyre of Orpheus</span> (1988), continued Davies's explorations of the magical and mystical, reflecting his Jungian understandings but also confirming, as one critic put it, his conviction that &#145;the modern habit of baring and telling all to be the most abysmal lack of good taste and manners&#146;  (C. Ford, <span class="italic">Calgary Herald</span>, 5 Dec 1995). Curiosity and intelligence are the major traits of his characters in the Cornish fables. The central figures, an artist and an opera singer, both ambiguous in their very natures, travel through Europe and North America in their pursuit of edification and ultimately salvation. At age seventy-four Davies had one or two new novels already in mind, but the third of the Cornish trilogy, <span class="italic">The Lyre of Orpheus</span>, was an occasion for drawing together the concerns of his highly symbolic novels&#151;mystical, comic, reflective, and didactic&#151;as well as a comment on the variety of life. The trilogy also furthered the translation of Davies into a dozen or more languages, reflecting the fact that although mainly Canada-centred, they draw on the full range of shared civilization in a deeper kind of measure.<br>
<br>Davies's lifelong fascination with the occult culminated in the novel <span class="italic">Murther and Walking Spirits</span> (1991) in which the principal character, Connor Gilmartin, is murdered in the first line. While Gilmartin initially sets out, as a ghost, to achieve his revenge, he ends up acquiring self-knowledge as he moves through his ancestral homeland of Wales and through North America, viewing incidents of his family history. Although it was undeniably both entertaining and illuminating, the novel failed to live up to the standards of Davies's trilogies. George Woodcock was especially unappreciative: &#145;Robertson Davies' theatrical past hangs heavy over his novels, which tend to combine saucily implausible plots with a good deal of creaking stage machinery, a romantic realist manner, and a shameless display of knowledge in some mildly esoteric field&#146;  (G. Woodcock, &#145;Attwood's dark parables, Davies' ballad of bankruptcy&#146;, <span class="italic">Quill and Quire</span>, August 1991, 14).<br>
<br>Davies's final novel, <span class="italic">The Cunning Man</span>, was published in 1995. The title character, a Toronto physician whose life from his childhood in northern Ontario is formed in part by mysticism as much as by science, eventually achieves notable diagnostic insights that are unconventional and unparalleled. With some of the same characters as <span class="italic">Murther and Walking Spirits</span>, <span class="italic">The Cunning Man</span> is liberally sprinkled with asides about Anglican ritual, ageing, medieval art, hagiography, Burton's <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span>, and yet more arcane matter.<br>
<br>Davies lived long enough to see <span class="italic">The Cunning Man</span>, which he regarded as the second volume of yet another trilogy, receive the now well-established acclaim of his critics and his ardent enthusiasts. Following a brief illness, Robertson Davies died on 2 December 1995 in Orangeville, near his country house, Windhover, north of Toronto, leaving the third volume of his projected trilogy incomplete. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered over his farm at Windhover.<br>
<br>Davies left a remarkably rich legacy, including a posthumous volume of speeches, essays, book reviews, and articles in newspapers and periodicals. <span class="italic">Merry Heart</span> (1996) embraces the store of wit and wonder that informs all his writing. His love for humankind, with all its remarkable foibles, expressed in his great good humour, patient understanding, and elaborate plots, has given to literature, and not just Canadian literature, a dimension that is both rare and durable. His lifelong rollicking sense of fun found reflection in the wry wit that informs so much of what he wrote and in the richness of his characters. Not surprisingly, Robertson Davies became in his lifetime something of a Canadian literary icon. He did so late in life and within little more than a decade. By the time of his death he had achieved widespread international recognition. The popularity of his novels continues unabated among a large and devoted following, both within Canada and without.<br>
