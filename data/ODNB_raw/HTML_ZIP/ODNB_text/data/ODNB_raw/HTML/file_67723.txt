<span class="headword">Thurston,  Frederick John</span>  (1901&#150;1953), <span class="occ">clarinettist</span>, was born on 21 September 1901 at the barracks in Lichfield Road, Whittington, Staffordshire, the younger of the two children (he had an elder sister) of Sergeant Frederick Thurston, military bandsman, of the 3rd South Staffordshire regiment, and his wife, Emma Goodman (<i>b</i>. 1866&times;9). He spent his childhood in Oxford, where he attended St Mary and St John School, and his father, when not away on band engagements, taught him the clarinet. At the age of ten he was noticed by Adrian Boult, then an undergraduate at Christ Church, and it was thanks to Boult's encouragement that in 1920, by now a member of the Cheltenham Municipal Orchestra, Thurston entered for, and won, an open scholarship to study with Charles Draper at the Royal College of Music, where Boult was teaching. After hearing Thurston play his clarinet concerto with the college orchestra in March 1922, Sir Charles Stanford wrote a letter of congratulation on his excellent performance. During his time at the college, and for some time afterwards, Thurston was able to survive financially through the generosity of Oscar Street, an amateur clarinettist. On 30 July 1927 he married Eileen (1901/2&#150;1947), a violinist, daughter of Dr A. C. King-Turner of Fairford, Gloucestershire; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>In December 1922 Thurston joined the first BBC music ensemble, which went on the air on 23 December with eight players, broadcasting from the 2LO studio in Marconi House. After the BBC's move to Savoy Hill the studio orchestra grew, becoming known as the 2LO Wireless Orchestra in 1924. Thurston, the principal clarinettist, signed a contract in August 1924 agreeing to play in at least six performances a week. Although this was not a full-time contract, and he appeared with other London orchestras in the years that followed, it was his main employment. When the BBC Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1930, Thurston was one of those asked to join, as principal clarinettist. The BBC Symphony Orchestra became the leading British orchestra, with Boult as chief conductor from 1931, but was directed also by conductors such as Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini; the latter, who first visited in 1935, became Thurston's idol. Although members of the orchestra were not allowed to accept outside engagements without permission from the BBC, making it difficult to pursue a solo career, Thurston began to attract the attention of contemporary British composers, who were inspired by his playing to write for the clarinet. He was largely responsible for the acceptance of the clarinet as a solo instrument by British composers, as British audiences had rarely heard anything written for the clarinet other than Victorian salon pieces until he began performing such early twentieth-century masterpieces as Debussy's <span class="italic">Rhapsody</span>, Berg's <span class="italic">Four Pieces</span>, and Stravinsky's <span class="italic">Three Pieces</span>. On 17 February 1933 he made his Wigmore Hall d&eacute;but in the first performance of Arthur Bliss's quintet for clarinet and strings, with the Kutcher Quartet, and he went on to give the first performances of Arnold Bax's sonata with Harriet Cohen in 1935, Gordon Jacob's quintet for clarinet and strings with the Griller Quartet in 1943, and John Ireland's <span class="italic">Fantasy-Sonata</span> with Kendall Taylor in 1944: these last two works were dedicated to him.<br>
<br>Thurston left the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1946, and in the next seven years gave the first performances of works by most of the leading British composers, many of them dedicated to him: these included Phyllis Tate's sonata for clarinet and cello (1947), Alan Rawsthorne's quartet for clarinet and strings (1948), Herbert Howells's clarinet sonata (1948), and the clarinet concertos by Malcolm Arnold (1949) and Gerald Finzi (1949). He also introduced British audiences to the clarinet concertos by Darius Milhaud (in 1947), Aaron Copland and Paul Hindemith (both in 1951), and Carl Nielsen (in 1952), and to the <span class="italic">Pastorale vari&eacute;e</span> by the Israeli composer Paul Ben-Haim in 1952. With the bassoonist Archie Camden he gave the first London performance of Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Duet concertino</span> in July 1949 in a Promenade Concert conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent at the Royal Albert Hall. Although most of the music he performed was modern, he played the Mozart clarinet concerto many times, including an annual performance of the work at the Proms. He became principal clarinettist of the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1949, but this did not prevent him from touring abroad: in 1949 he went on a British Council tour of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, and in 1950 toured Germany as soloist with the Jacques Orchestra.<br>
<br>An inspiring and much loved teacher, Thurston taught at the Royal College of Music from 1934 until his death, this period including the war years when the BBC Symphony Orchestra was evacuated first to Bristol and then to Bedford; when Ruth Railton founded the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain in 1948 she invited him to coach the woodwind section. The only recording with which he was satisfied was one of the Bliss quintet which he recorded with the Griller Quartet in 1935; he preferred the excitement and spontaneity of live performances. His clarinet playing was distinguished by his firm, clear tone, without vibrato, a style very different from that of the other leading clarinettist of his generation, Reginald Kell. After Toscanini had conducted his first rehearsal with the Philharmonia Orchestra in September 1952 he told Walter Legge, its founder, &#145;That first clarinet&#151;<i>that</i> is a great artist! He plays with the accents of a human voice&#146;  (Pettitt, 66). With his former pupil Alan Frank, Thurston published a clarinet tutor in 1939, and he brought out three books of passage studies (1947); his book <span class="italic">Clarinet Technique</span> was completed after his death by Thea King and John Warrack and published in 1956.<br>
<br>Thurston was made a CBE in 1952. On 22 January 1953 he remarried: his second wife was a former pupil, the clarinettist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98877/', "Thea King (1925&#150;2007)")</script>, later Dame Thea King, daughter of Henry Walter Mayer King, manufacturer of agricultural machinery, of Hitchin, Hertfordshire. A keen golfer, a member of the Savage Club, and a bon viveur, Thurston was also a heavy smoker, and developed lung cancer. Although he returned to the concert platform after having one lung removed in 1952, he died of cancer on 12 December 1953 in the London Hospital, Whitechapel, London.<br>
