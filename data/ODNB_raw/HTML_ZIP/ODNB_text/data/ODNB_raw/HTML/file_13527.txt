<span class="headword">Holland,  Hugh</span>  (1563&#150;1633), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Denbigh, the younger son of Robert Holland and his wife, whose maiden name was Pain or Payne. He became a pupil of William Camden, for whom he retained a lifelong loyalty, and who numbered him with Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, and Michael Drayton as one of the &#145;most pregnant wits of these our times&#146;  (W. Camden, <span class="italic">Remaines</span>, 1614, 8). After attending Westminster School he was elected scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1589. He graduated BA in 1593&#150;4 and MA in 1597. A Hugh Holland matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in March 1583. This is usually identified with the poet, although his cool references to Oxford in <span class="italic">A Cypress Garland</span> suggest that he felt little connection with that university. He retained close links with Wales, returning there for a period in 1601, probably in connection with the disturbances surrounding the Denbighshire elections in that year. While travelling through Germany and Holland in 1603 he heard news of the death of Elizabeth I. This journey, he said, fulfilled &#145;the desire I had but once in my life to see the world (for until then I had been always one of the Queen's deer)&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">Pancharis</span>, sig. D5<i>r</i>). Fuller reported that:<blockquote>he travailed beyond the seas and in Italy (conceiving himself without ear-reach of the English) let flie freely against the Credit of Queen Elizabeth. He went to Jerusalem, though there he was not made, or he would not own himself Knight of the Sepulchre (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 16)</blockquote>and that he was subsequently rebuked by Sir Thomas Glover, James I's ambassador in Constantinople, for his indiscretion. This detail dates the trip to 1606&#150;13, the period of Glover's residence in Constantinople.<br>
<br>In London Holland was one of several poets and parliamentarians (including John Donne, Inigo Jones, and John Hoskyns) who met at the Mitre tavern about 1610. His ties with literary men remained strong throughout his life: Ben Jonson (whom Holland may have introduced to his near neighbour in Wales, Sir John Salusbury of Lleweni) wrote a dedicatory ode for Holland's <span class="italic">Pancharis</span> (1603), and Holland wrote dedicatory poems for Giles Farnaby's <span class="italic">Canzonets to Fowre Voyces</span> (1598), for Jonson's <span class="italic">Sejanus</span> (1605), Bolton's <span class="italic">Elements of Armory</span> (1610), <span class="italic">Parthenia</span> (1611), and Thomas Hawkins's <span class="italic">Odes of Horace</span> (1625). He also contributed mock-heroic verses to Thomas Coryate's <span class="italic">Odcombian Banquet</span> (1611) in Greek, Latin, and Welsh. In his last year he wrote Latin verses for the authorized edition of the Latin drama <span class="italic">Roxana</span> (1632), composed by his fellow student of Westminster and Trinity, William Alabaster. Fuller records that he also wrote a life of Camden, verses in description of the chief cities of Europe, and chronicles of the reign of Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Holland is chiefly remembered as the author of a dedicatory poem included in the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, although his other works are of greater note. They include an elegy on the death of Henry, prince of Wales, an epitaph on Queen Elizabeth (printed in Camden's <span class="italic">Remaines</span>), <span class="italic">A Cypress Garland</span> (1625) on the death of James I, and an incomplete epic poem, <span class="italic">Pancharis</span>. This poem relates, in richly Spenserian language, and with many echoes of <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> 4, the courtship of Owen Tudor and Queen Katherine. Intended as a dynastic compliment to Elizabeth, and probably composed about 1601 (when several natives of Denbighshire sought to show their loyalty to the crown in the aftermath of the Essex rebellion), the poem was eventually printed in the summer of 1603, after the queen's death. The epistle appended to <span class="italic">Pancharis</span> promises further books which were to have recounted the martial exploits of Owen Glendower, and which would have been dedicated to Henry, prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Holland recorded that through the patronage of the duke of Buckingham he kissed the hand of James I three times in twenty weeks (&#145;And with his snowy hand my lips he warmed&#146;; <span class="italic">A Cypress Garland</span>, sig. A4<i>r</i>). There is no record that he ever received more material favours from the Stuarts, although Buckingham forwarded a suit of his to the king, and Holland's elegy for Prince Henry records that:<blockquote>
<div>oft, when as to Westminster I trudged<br>
</div>
<div>About my fift yeers Suite (but yet unjudged)<br>
</div>
<div>He [that is, Henry] cheered my heart that was full heavy.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Sundry Funeral Elegies</span>, 1613, sig. D2<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Fuller's claim that &#145;he grumbled out the rest of his life in visible discontentment&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 16) may have some truth in it: he had a lengthy legal dispute with John Reynoldes over the freehold of property in Paternoster Row and &#145;Ivey Lane&#146;. This remained unresolved at his death.<br>
<br>Holland was a Catholic until April 1626, when he submitted to the national church after having been indicted for recusancy. He married Ursula, the widow of Robert Woodard of Burnham, Buckinghamshire. A daughter &#145;Phil&#146; and a son Martin were dead by 1625; a son, Arbellin, or Arbellinus, lived to be his father's executor, and eventually, in 1638, resolved his father's legal battle with Reynoldes. Holland was made a freeman of the Mercers' Company by redemption, gratis, on 4 September 1621. Holland died intestate in London on or about 18 July 1633, presumably after a long illness, since reports of his death circulated as early as June 1632. He had suffered from gout. His son Arbellin was granted letters of administration on 31 August 1633. He was buried in Westminster Abbey in the south part of the church on 23 July 1633. No likeness survives, but his dark hair and skin (described in <span class="italic">Pancharis</span> as his distinguishing features) led Ben Jonson to describe his friend as the &#145;black swan&#146;.<br>
