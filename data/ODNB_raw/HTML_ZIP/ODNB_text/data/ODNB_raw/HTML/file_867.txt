<span class="headword">Atkyns, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1647, <em>d.</em> 1711), <span class="occ">topographer and antiquary</span>, was baptized at Monken Hadley, Middlesex, on 26 August 1647, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/866/', "Sir Robert Atkyns (bap. 1621, d. 1710)")</script>, lawyer, and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1681), daughter of Sir George Clerk, of Watford, Northamptonshire. He was a nephew of Sir Edward Atkyns (1630/31&#150;1698). Following family tradition he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1661, but he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 14 March 1663. He was knighted at Bristol on 5 September that year and in 1664 was made a fellow of the Royal Society. He was called to the bar in 1668, but did not practise.<br>
<br>By licence dated 5 July 1669 Atkyns married, in Holborn, Louise (1653&#150;1716), daughter of Sir George Carteret of Hawnes, Bedfordshire, and about that time settled at Pinbury Park, Duntisbourne Rouse, Gloucestershire, an estate purchased by his father in 1661. Having been deputy receiver-general of law duties in 1671&#150;2 and receiver-general in 1672&#150;3, he served as comptroller of law duties from 1673 to 1679. He was simultaneously a commissioner for assessment in Gloucestershire (1673&#150;80) and, becoming a JP for the county in 1673, remained so for most of the rest of his life. After an unsuccessful attempt, supported by his father, to enter parliament as member for Cirencester in 1671 he was returned for the seat in the three parliaments of 1679 to 1681, and sat as MP for Gloucestershire from 1685 to 1687.<br>
<br>Overshadowed by his father, who as chief baron of the exchequer was speaker of the House of Lords between 1689 and 1693, and with whom he had political disagreements, Atkyns refused to take the oath of allegiance to William III and chose to retire to Pinbury Park, where he had the opportunity to explore his topographical interests. The first of the three major Gloucestershire antiquaries&#151;the other two being Ralph Bigland (1712&#150;1784) and Samuel Rudder (1726&#150;1801)&#151;Atkyns collected material for parish histories, incorporating manuscripts on church history passed to him by Richard Parsons (1643&#150;1711), chancellor of Gloucester diocese between 1677 and 1711. He compiled comprehensive manorial descents and attempted to record the population of each parish, based on the numbers of houses therein and the yearly birth and burial numbers. The resulting first folio county history of Gloucestershire, his <span class="italic">Ancient and Present State of Glostershire</span> (1712), which eulogizes the Stuarts, is especially valuable for its series of sixty-five engravings by Johannes Kip, illustrating the county seats and manor houses in the first decade of the eighteenth century, and preserving a record of features now altered or entirely lost.<br>
<br>Atkyns contracted dysentery and died on 29 November 1711 at his Westminster house. He was buried on 12 December in Sapperton church, Gloucestershire, where a monument portraying him in life-size effigy was raised in the south transept. Atkyns was survived by his wife, who died in 1716; they had no surviving children.<br>
