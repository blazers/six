<span class="headword">Sprott,  Walter John Herbert <span class="st"> [Sebastian]</span></span>  (1897&#150;1971), <span class="occ">sociologist</span>, was born at Sillwood Place, Crowborough, Sussex, on 19 April 1897, the son of Herbert Sprott, a country solicitor, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Williams. He was dominated in infancy by his mother, was sent to Felsted, a boarding-school with a rigorous regime, and then in 1919 entered Clare College, Cambridge, to read the moral sciences, in which he took a double first.<br>
<br>Perhaps this is the central characterization of Edwardian childhood among the English professional classes. But Sprott was eccentric. Charm and wit and oratorical skill led him effortlessly into the magic circle of John Maynard Keynes's close friends; he became an intimate of E. M. Forster, who eventually made him his literary executor, and of Lytton Strachey. He became &#145;Sebastian&#146; in the overlapping circles of Cambridge and Bloomsbury. He was elected to the exclusive society of the Apostles in 1920. He regularly went riding with Keynes, accompanied him on a holiday to Algeria and Tunisia in 1921, and was probably his last male lover. This intimacy, though not the friendship, ended with Keynes's marriage to Lydia Lopokova in 1925.<br>
<br>In that year Sprott, who had been a demonstrator in the psychological laboratory at Cambridge since 1922, moved to a lectureship in psychology at Nottingham University, though the habit of frequent, almost daily, letters customary between Bloomsberries continued to include the name Sebastian. Much of this correspondence was later destroyed. Thus many of the letters from Sprott were burnt either by Maynard himself or by his brother Geoffrey. However, a few survived. One, written in April 1921 after reading Hirschfield's <span class="italic">History of Sex</span>, reads &#145;I suspect I am tainted with Transvestitismus, Autonomosexualit&auml;t, and Hermaphroditismus &hellip; to say nothing of Homosexualit&auml;t and Onanie &hellip; My love, Yours ever Sebastian&#146;  (Skidelsky, 35). That was to Keynes.<br>
<br>The combination of intellect with aestheticism was much admired after the First World War&#151;so much so that &#145;sprott&#146; was generalized in Cambridge argot as a label for fashionable cleverness. Yet Sprott made no secret of his sexual tastes. He pioneered the path to the nightclubs of Berlin, being subsequently followed by Christopher Isherwood and W. H. Auden. Between the wars, with his friend Joe Ackerley, he sought &#145;low-life adventure&#146; in the pubs of Dover and Portsmouth. In Nottingham he lived in a squalid Victorian terrace, where academic colleagues and their wives were served by discharged prisoners. Here the Bloomsbury appellation Sebastian was dropped in favour of the more matey and proletarian forename Jack.<br>
<br>All this threw a shadow of loneliness and sadness over Sprott's personal life, but it did not darken the charming courtesy or cloud the manners of the old-fashioned don which he unfailingly presented to the respectable world. Nor did it blight his academic performance. He was applauded on every side as a lecturer of outstanding wit and eloquent exposition. Invitations to give public lectures came in a steady flow throughout his career. Caustic and ruthless demolition of theories, especially those promoting salvation through simplistic politics or the &#145;quick fix&#146;, came readily to his lips, and colleagues and students relished his private conversation.<br>
<br>Moreover Sprott ranged freely over a wider intellectual territory than is now academically fashionable. He held chairs in philosophy and in psychology at Nottingham. Above all he held fast to his belief in sociology as an academic discipline throughout the time in which it was resisted by the British establishment&#151;that is, from his translation to a lectureship in psychology at Nottingham in 1925, through his incumbency first in the readership of philosophy there from 1928 to 1948, then in the chair of philosophy from 1948 to 1960. He served Nottingham University with steadfast loyalty and was its public orator from 1948 to 1964.<br>
<br>Sprott published <span class="italic">Physique and Character</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis</span> (1933), translations of works by Kretschmer and Freud respectively. But his sociological writings, though little read today, remain important in sociology's history. All were written with lucid elegance. He was the first English sociologist to offer an informed, critical, and sympathetic view both of European writing in &#145;the grand manner&#146; and of the sophisticated functionalism of the American R. K. Merton. There were only three named chairs of sociology in the UK when he gave the Josiah Mason lectures at the University of Birmingham in 1953. His <span class="italic">Sociology</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Science and Social Action</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">Sociology at the Seven Dials</span> (1962) form a bridge from Hobhousian evolutionism to the functionalism which dominated the subject after the Second World War; they also link Parsonian general theory to more modest theories of the middle ground. So Sprott challenged functionalism by quoting Talcott Parsons: &#145;the combination of an occupationally differentiated industrial system and a significantly solidary kinship system <i>must</i> be a system of stratification in which the children of the more highly placed come to have differential advantages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Social System</span>, 161). He thereby showed that the evolution of industrial societies has functional limitations  (<span class="italic">Science and Social Action</span>, 139). He was a genial and articulate link between the older founders of sociology in Britain, such as Hobhouse and Ginsberg, and the new professionals emerging in the aftermath of the Second World War. He was hailed by Sir Leon Radzinowicz  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 Sept 1971) as an influential figure in the development of criminology as an academic subject. Sprott died on 2 September 1971 of acute heart failure at his home in Langham Road, Blakeney, Norfolk. He was childless and unmarried but was mourned by many friends.<br>
