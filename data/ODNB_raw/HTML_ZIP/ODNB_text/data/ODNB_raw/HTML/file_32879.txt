<span class="headword">Montagu,  John Walter Edward  Douglas-Scott-</span>, second Baron Montagu of Beaulieu  (1866&#150;1929), <span class="occ">promoter of motoring</span>, was born on 10 June 1866 at 3 Tilney Street, London, the eldest son of Lord Henry John Montagu-Douglas-Scott (1832&#150;1905), landowner, and his wife, the Hon. Cecily Susan, younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26730/', "John Stuart-Wortley, second Baron Wharncliffe")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26731/', "Wortley, James Archibald Stuart-, first Baron Wharncliffe")</script>]. His father was the second son of the fifth duke of Buccleuch and was raised to the peerage in 1885 as Lord Henry John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, first Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. On Lord Henry's marriage in 1866 he was given the family estate of Beaulieu, Hampshire, which provided the background to Montagu's childhood and stimulated his interest in rural life.<br>
<br>In childhood Montagu developed asthma, which caused him to be educated by private tutors until deemed strong enough at fourteen to go to Eton. As well as rowing, he enjoyed shooting and captained the school's shooting eight for three successive years. He joined the Eton College Volunteers, becoming a colour sergeant, and proceeded to a commission in the 4th battalion, Hampshire volunteers, after leaving school. His interest in transport developed while at Eton, in the form of cycling. At New College, Oxford, from 1886 Montagu led an active sporting and social life, stroking the college boat to the head of the river in 1887 and joining in Oxford amateur dramatics. However he had no commitment to the subject of his studies, history, and left in 1889 without a degree. By this time he had already shown his dedicated enthusiasm for another form of transport by training as a competent engine driver and fitter. On 4 June 1889 he married Lady Cecil Victor Constance Kerr (<i>d</i>. 1919); they had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1890 Montagu was adopted as the tory candidate for the New Forest constituency and he was returned in the 1892 general election. In the same year he visited southern Africa, where his father had business interests. On his return he championed Cecil Rhodes and became a director of six companies operating in Africa; his interest in and business connections with Rhodesia remained strong for many years. These interests prompted a visit of several months to South Africa in 1896, when he combined some journalism with military action.<br>
<br>In the months following Montagu's return in July 1896 the <span class="roman">Locomotives on Highways Bill</span> moved towards its passage into law in November 1896. During this period he developed the passion for motor cars which was to dominate his life. He acquired his first, a Daimler, in 1898 and in January of the following year joined the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland (later the RAC), becoming a member of its committee six months later. In 1899 Montagu established the right of MPs to drive their cars into Palace Yard and took the prince of Wales for a drive, which seems to have confirmed the latter in his intention to acquire a car. Montagu also took part in the Paris&#150;Ostend race in 1899, finishing third despite mechanical problems. In 1900 he participated in the Automobile Club's Thousand Miles Trial, with its object of proving the general safety and reliability of the motor car under a variety of conditions.<br>
<br>The motor car was by now Montagu's primary interest and he took steps to establish a new publication, having first sought advice (including a temporary placement on the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>) from Alfred Harmsworth, who had underwritten the Thousand Miles Trial. At the end of May 1902 Montagu launched <span class="italic">Car Illustrated</span> as a &#145;quality&#146; weekly. Subtitled &#145;A Journal of Travel by Land, Sea and Air&#146;, it necessarily drew on a wide range of contributors, including Charles Rolls, known to Montagu as a fellow competitor in the Paris&#150;Ostend race and participant in the Thousand Miles Trial. The <span class="italic">Car Illustrated</span> offered readers the benefit of insurance and travel and technical information, and motoring-related guides and books, written or edited by Montagu. It remained in Montagu's ownership for fourteen years, but only made a profit in five of those years; a sister monthly, the <span class="italic">Car Magazine</span>, had to be abandoned, but <span class="italic">Car Illustrated</span> proved to be influential. For all his enthusiasm, Montagu was realistic and moderate in his advocacy of motoring interests. Thus, in return for the abolition of the speed limit (of 12 m.p.h.), his <span class="roman">Motor Vehicles Registration Bill</span> of 1902, supported by the legislative committee of the Automobile Club, provided for the registration of motor vehicles and the display of registration plates to enable motoring offenders to be identified. Montagu's original bill failed to get a second reading, but in July 1903 the cabinet introduced its own <span class="roman">Motor Car Bill</span>, which included a speed limit, determined, as a compromise, at 20 m.p.h. Montagu's unwillingness to oppose the government's introduction of a speed limit aroused strong criticism from some of his motoring colleagues. The decision led to a major shake-up within the Automobile Club, Montagu leading a successful reform movement.<br>
<br>Montagu's journalistic ambition led him in 1904 into an abortive attempt, in collaboration with Harmsworth, to purchase the <span class="italic">Standard</span> from the Johnstone family. After protracted and complex negotiations Montagu's efforts were beaten by a high bid from Arthur Pearson, but Montagu eventually negotiated with Harmsworth an annual retainer as a parliamentary journalist, contributing a nightly article to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> while parliament was in session. Meanwhile another form of transport took up Montagu's enthusiasm and energy in 1904&#150;5, the motor boat or &#145;sea racer&#146;, a version of which he had proposed for naval reconnaissance in November 1902. In partnership with Lionel de Rothschild, he had two successful seasons' racing in 1905 and 1906, but he had succeeded to the title and the Beaulieu estates on his father's death on 4 November 1905. New responsibilities and journalistic commitments left him little time to continue with competitive power boating.<br>
<br>The motor car made an additional claim on Montagu through his involvement with Rolls-Royce and Brooklands, the racing circuit at Weybridge developed by H. F. Locke-King in 1907. <span class="italic">Car Illustrated</span> gave publicity both to the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and to the circuit and Montagu opened the new Rolls-Royce factory at Derby in 1908. With Charles Rolls he attended the International Road Congress in Paris in 1908, then visited Wilbur Wright's flying demonstration at Camp d'Auvours. The short demonstration he saw reinforced his belief in the supremacy of air power. He was a founder member of the Aerial (later Air) League, a pressure group for the commercial as well as military use of aviation.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of war Montagu was gazetted to command the 7th Hampshire reserve battalion, which was sent out to India early in 1915; however, on arrival he was appointed to the army general staff as inspector of motor vehicles. In that capacity Montagu produced a critical report on the Indian armoured car force and advocated a chain of air bases. He also strongly urged the mechanization of army transport, with the prerequisite of an improved road network. In the summer of 1915 Montagu returned to England to plead India's case for military vehicles, and also for aeroplanes for the north-west frontier.<br>
<br>Sailing back to India at the end of 1915 Montagu narrowly escaped death when the SS <i>Persia</i> was torpedoed. His long-time secretary and mistress, Eleanor Velasco Thornton, who was travelling with him as far as Port Said, died in the disaster. This loss was deeply felt by Montagu, the more so in that its severity could not be openly acknowledged. Eleanor Thornton was reputed to have inspired the famous Rolls-Royce figurehead (carried on the bonnet of every car), and she and Montagu had a daughter. Although fostered, the girl was later befriended by Montagu as her &#145;uncle&#146;.<br>
<br>During a subsequent visit to England, Montagu organized military transport for India, including &#145;Indian standard lorries&#146;. He also entered the fierce air power debate, reviving his pre-war charges of national unreadiness for war in the air, arguing for the establishment of an air ministry, and proposing to the Air Board that aero-engine components should be made by motor manufacturers. Montagu gave evidence to the Bailhache committee of 1916 on the efficiency of the Royal Flying Corps but some of his allegations against the Royal Aircraft Factory failed to impress. He returned to India at the end of 1916 but the Admiralty's proposed purchase of Ditton Park, one of his family estates, brought him home once again in March 1917. The Gotha bombing offensive of 1917 then involved Montagu in a contentious public debate on aerial warfare and the need for enhanced air defences. He also served on the civil aerial transport committee of the Air Board.<br>
<br>After a speaking tour in Canada, advocating an imperial air service, Montagu returned to India, not finally leaving until April 1919. During his time there he had successfully implemented the motorization of military transport. His wife died in September 1919 and on 10 August the following year he married Alice Pearl Barrington-Crake; they had three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Although he had failed to secure the future of the road board in 1919, Montagu re-established himself as a leading spokesman for road transport, partly through a series of articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the summer of 1921. From 1923 to 1925 he was chairman of a syndicate which sought to build a private enterprise motorway, albeit with some public financial support, from London to Liverpool via Birmingham and Manchester. The project became enmeshed in political discussion about its delaying effects on local authority road-building schemes and its implications for other projects to reduce unemployment, as well as the principle of private enterprise road provision. The final objection came from a surprising quarter: in December 1924 the president of the Commercial Motor Users' Association wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> expressing his total opposition to the project and supporting through traffic on improved railways. Two further transport projects then engaged Montagu. In 1925 in collaboration with Sir Samuel Instone he proposed a Thames express service of large diesel launches, but this foundered over proposed funding of new piers by the London county council. Then, at the request of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Montagu visited Persia and Iraq with his wife in 1927 to advise the company on transport problems.<br>
<br>By the end of the following year Montagu was increasingly troubled by ill health and he died on 30 March 1929 at 29 Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London, from pneumonia and a post-operative chest infection. He was succeeded as third baron by Edward John Barrington Douglas-Scott-Montagu (<i>b</i>. 1926), who created the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu in his memory. Montagu, who was survived by his wife, was buried in Beaulieu Abbey church.<br>
