<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Arthur Edwin</span>  (1907&#150;1979), <span class="occ">policeman</span>, was born at 55 Chamberlayne Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire, on 15 February 1907, one of four children of Edwin Young (1878&#150;1936), a builder, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Brown (1880&#150;1945). He attended Portsmouth grammar school and when aged sixteen joined the city's police against his family's wishes. For a non-Hendon graduate Young's promotion was meteoric: by 1938 he was the youngest ever chief constable (Leamington Spa). Seconded to Coventry after its blitz he introduced the good neighbour scheme for bombed out civilians later adopted by the Home Office. In 1941 he was selected as senior assistant chief constable, Birmingham, and in 1943 was chosen to establish the training school for policemen who would maintain law and order in liberated axis territory. Within ten weeks Young found himself director of public safety (Italy) in the first functioning military government. The models developed were applied across allied occupied western Europe, but his proudest achievement was the restoration of the <i>carabinieri</i>.<br>
<br>Appointed chief constable of Hertfordshire in 1944 (but released from the army only in 1945), Young set the pace in revitalizing long-debilitated county forces, encouraging major expenditure on officers' welfare and modern efficiency. So impressed was the home secretary that in 1947 Young was posted assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. To appoint an outsider to such a rank was an unprecedented step and senior colleagues cold-shouldered him. But the Met proved the stepping-stone to a post whose authority and independence allowed him to exercise a powerful influence on police affairs: as commissioner of the City of London police from 1950 to 1971. The first beat bobby made a commissioner, Young became known as the policeman's policeman. Improved pay and professional standards remained his constant preoccupations. He engineered a national recruitment revolution, running command courses and seeing through a fast-track graduate entry: Young was the first senior officer wedded to Sir Robert Peel's intention that the police be &#145;filled from the bottom up&#146;. His sure-footed lobby of the 1960 royal commission overcame Home Office objections to a strengthened inspectorate (although Sir Charles Cunningham blocked his selection as inaugural chief inspector).<br>
<br>Young undertook three missions to remodel colonial policing: the Gold Coast (1951), Malaya (1952&#150;3), and Kenya (1954). He set out to introduce the colonies to the common law status of English constables and the philosophy of policing as a public service. Colonial gendarmeries, he proposed, ought to be eradicated, and the police released from executive control. Young thus challenged orthodoxies in storm centres of imperial discontent, but the first two secondments proved dazzling successes. The Gold Coast embraced fundamental reform and Young's report moulded Ghana's policing after independence. To save Malaya a new high commissioner and police commissioner were dispatched simultaneously: Gerald Templer and Arthur Young. &#145;No one disagreed with Templer more or got on with him better than I&#146; Young wrote. Templer acknowledged Young's &#145;astounding innovations&#146; in converting a militia into a constabulary. &#145;The police are the friends of the public whom they wish to serve&#146; was the ethos of the cultural revolution which the federation police inhaled. Detention without trial ceased. Martial law was never introduced; Young talked Templer round. It was Young who was primarily responsible for Templer's success in tackling the emergency through policing, thereby conciliating local opinion. J. Edgar Hoover invited him in 1953 to brief the Federal Bureau of Investigation directorate on the methodology of defeating communist insurgency.<br>
<br>The cabinet sent Young to Kenya, torn by the Mau Mau uprising, to work another transformation. Everything went wrong. Nairobi resented his presence and dismissed his contention that civil disorders be resolved by civil principles. Young curtailed police use of guns and physical force. The CID was resuscitated. The first training for African constables began and, in the Church Missionary Society's opinion, he quickly improved the police's conduct towards the African population. But he could not break what he termed &#145;the rule of fear&#146;. Executive interference in policing was endemic. Brutality was institutionalized in the Home Guard and condoned by district officers. Matters came to a head in November&#150;December 1954 when the governor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30789/', "(Charles) Evelyn Baring")</script>, refused to act on dossiers detailing official attempts to obstruct prosecutions of Home Guard personnel for murder; the governor's general amnesty of January 1955 was a subsequent device to cover the administration's tracks. When Baring simultaneously rejected his renewed plea for the structural safeguard of day-to-day policing free from the executive's control, Young resigned in December 1954, expecting to &#145;attract the attention of those in authority in London who had the means to put things right&#146;. But Whitehall suppressed his resignation letter, which was packed with seismic details, while Young himself stayed silent out of a misplaced sense of duty. A sense of unfinished business led him, however, to advise Jomo Kenyatta's delegations at the pre-independence constitutional conferences.<br>
<br>Vetoed for Cyprus in 1956, Young's troubleshooting had ended until James Callaghan sent him to Ireland in 1969 to implement the Hunt report: his brief was to disband the B specials, demilitarize the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), and create a police service. Young liberated Ulster's police from Stormont's and the army's operational control. Stormont's cabinet judged him a political liability and Unionist street graffiti declared &#145;Sir Arthur Young&#151;Traitor!&#146; Ian Paisley was a vituperative critic. But there was no way back; Young enjoyed Callaghan's confidence. With nationalists, by contrast, this imposed Englishman, an impartial and approachable policeman, was an immediate success. Falls Road residents told him &#145;we have waited fifty years for you&#146;. Although he never convinced London of the need to abolish the <span class="roman">Special Powers Act</span>, the first steps away from aggressive policing were taken and the first moves made to heal the fateful split between Catholics and the RUC.<br>
<br>Autocratic and a strict disciplinarian, Young was famous for his loyalty to his men. He was married three times. On 11 March 1939 he married a nurse, Ivy Ada May Hammond (1908&#150;1956); they had a son. His second wife was Margaret Furnival Dolphin (<i>d</i>. 1966), whom he married in 1957; they subsequently separated. On 16 August 1970 he married Ileen Fryer Turner, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rayner. Although Young twice contemplated Anglican ordination, he was driven by a mission to make the police a respected profession. Young was 6 feet 4 inches tall and possessed of a formidable charm; his anti-Masonic, anti-capital punishment Christian socialist politics set him apart among post-war British police chiefs. He was appointed CMG (1953), CVO (1962), knight bachelor (1965), and KBE (1971); colleagues attempted unsuccessfully to secure him a life peerage.<br>
<br>Young died at St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 20 January 1979. His ashes were subsequently scattered at Beachy Head.<br>
