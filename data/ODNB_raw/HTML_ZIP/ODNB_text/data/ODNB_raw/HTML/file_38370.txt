<span class="headword">Carlile,  Elizabeth Sharples</span>  (1803&#150;1852), <span class="occ">freethought lecturer and advocate of women's rights</span>, was one of six children born to Ann and Richard Sharples, a counterpane manufacturer, in Bolton, Lancashire, probably late in 1803. The family was pious and prosperous, the children received a good education, and Eliza attended boarding-school until she was about twenty. She then remained at home, sewing and reading, not questioning her faith until the deaths of her eldest sister, father, and a brother shook her faith in providence and prepared her for the theological unorthodoxy of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4685/', "Richard Carlile (1790&#150;1843)")</script>.<br>
<br>When Richard Carlile visited Bolton in 1827 Elizabeth Sharples thought him no better than the devil, but her curiosity was aroused when he and Robert Taylor came to dine with the father of a school friend whom she was visiting in Liverpool in 1829. About a year later she discovered her cousin reading Carlile's former paper, <span class="italic">The Republican</span>, and saw Carlile's publications in his library. She began visiting a local freethought bookseller called Hardie, and in December 1831 requested him to ask Carlile to write to her. After a rapid exchange of correspondence in which admiration turned to ardent love, she determined to share his work. On 11 January 1832 she arrived in London where Carlile, who had parted from his wife, Jane, in 1830, was in the Giltspur Street compter serving two years for sedition.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Sharples gave her first discourse at the Rotunda lecture theatre in Blackfriars on 29 January 1832. <span class="italic">The Times</span> (18 Feb 1832) found her pretty, with a good figure and genteel manners, and thought she dressed very well. Cast in the role of the Egyptian goddess Isis, she stood on the stage of the theatre, the floor strewn with whitethorn and laurel, and delivered lectures on mystical religion and women's rights that were then printed in <span class="italic">The Isis</span>, which she edited (11 February&#150;15 December 1832). Once the novelty had passed, though, she was unable to hold her audiences or readers, and she had no head for business.<br>
<br>Sharples consummated her relationship with Carlile while he was still in gaol, and a son, Richard Sharples, was born in April 1833 but died of smallpox in October. From Carlile's release in August 1833 the couple cohabited in a &#145;moral union&#146; from which time Elizabeth Sharples adopted Carlile as an assumed name. The Carliles lived first at his London house and shop on the corner of Bouverie Street and Fleet Street, where another son, Julian Hibbert, was born in September 1834. In November 1835 they took a seven-year lease on a cottage in Enfield Highway, where shortly afterwards a daughter, Hypatia, was born. A fourth child, Theophila, followed a year later. Though Eliza accompanied her partner on lecture tours, she played little further part in his public work. He died intestate, thus leaving her destitute, on 10 February 1843.<br>
<br>At first, the family was supported by Sophia Chichester, who arranged for Eliza to take charge of the sewing-room at the Ham Common Concordium. After a few months a small legacy from an aunt enabled her to set up on her own, letting apartments and maintaining her family by her needlework. In 1849, again in dire poverty, she was helped by a public subscription to set up a coffee and discussion room at 1 Warner Place, Hackney Road, in which to advocate radical freethought and women's rights. Here she gave a temporary home to the young Charles Bradlaugh. She &#145;looked like a queen&#146; but was &#145;no good at serving coffee&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Guide</span>, 1 April 1915); in a few months both her business and her health had failed, and she died on 11 January 1852 at her home, 12 George Street, Hackney.<br>
