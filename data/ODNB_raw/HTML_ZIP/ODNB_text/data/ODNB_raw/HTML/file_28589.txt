<span class="headword">Walmisley,  Thomas Forbes</span>  (1783&#150;1866), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, third son of William Walmisley, clerk of the papers to the House of Lords, was born in Union (later St Margaret's) Street, Westminster, on 22 May 1783. He, like all his brothers, was a chorister in Westminster Abbey, and he was a scholar at Westminster School from 1793 to 1798. He studied music under John Spencer and Thomas Attwood, a pupil of Mozart. He began his career as a teacher of the piano and singing in 1803 and as a composer of vocal music in 1805. From 1810 to 1814 he was assistant organist to the female orphan asylum in Lambeth. Also in 1810 he married the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4594/', "William Capon (1757&#150;1827)")</script>, draughtsman to the duke of York. They had twelve children, of whom ten survived beyond infancy. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28588/', "Thomas Attwood Walmisley")</script>, composer and organist, was the eldest. Another son, Henry (1830&#150;1857), also became an organist, of Holy Trinity, Bessborough Gardens, Pimlico. Frederick Walmisley (1815&#150;1875) became a moderately successful artist. A great-niece, Jessie Walmisley, married Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875&#150;1912), composer. In 1814 Walmisley succeeded Robert Cooke (<i>fl</i>. 1793&#150;1814) as organist of St Martin-in-the-Fields, which post he resigned, on a pension, in March 1854. From 1817 he was secretary of the re-established Concentores Sodales, which was dissolved in 1847, the society's stock of wine becoming his property; and in 1827 he was elected a professional member of the Catch Club.<br>
<br>Walmisley was principally a composer of glees; he wrote fifty-nine, four of which gained prizes and many of which were published in four separate collections. He also composed ten anthems, one short morning and evening service, and <span class="italic">Sacred Songs</span> (1841). He was well known as a teacher: perhaps his most distinguished pupil was Edward J. Hopkins. Walmisley died at 19 Earl's Court Gardens, Brompton, London, on 10 July 1866 and was buried in the family grave at Brompton cemetery.<br>
