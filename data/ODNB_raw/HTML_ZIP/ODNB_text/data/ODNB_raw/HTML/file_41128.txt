<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coburn,  Alvin Langdon</span>  (1882&#150;1966), <span class="occ">photographer and mystic</span>, was born on 11 June 1882 at 134 East Springfield Street, Boston, Massachusetts, the only child of James Alvin Coburn (1849&#150;1891), manufacturer of Coburn and Whitman shirts, and his wife, Fannie E. Howe (<i>d</i>. 1928). In 1887 the family moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts, where Coburn attended the Chauncey Hall School (1891&#150;5). His father having died, he moved with his mother in 1897 back to Boston, where they lived in Boylston Street, and the following year he met his distant cousin, Fred Holland Day, the American publisher of the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> and symbolist photographer of homoerotic orientation. In 1899 Coburn made the first of thirteen transatlantic crossings to London in the company of his devoted but domineering mother. He took rooms at 89 Guilford Street, Russell Square, and exhibited nine photographs at a Royal Photographic Society exhibition organized by Holland Day in 1900.<br>
<br>After touring in France, Switzerland, and Germany with his mother, Coburn opened a studio at 384 5th Avenue, New York, in 1902, and attended for two years running Arthur Wesley Dow's Summer School of Art in Ipswich, Massachusetts, where he mastered the principles of Japanese design. Arthur Symons's <span class="italic">Cities</span> (1903) provided a model for Coburn's own projected series, &#145;The adventures of cities&#146;, on London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Paris, Pittsburgh, and New York. Coburn's symbolist aim was to draw confidences out of the very stones of the buildings and to transfigure such cities by means of his own special combination of Japanese composition, impressionist tone, and Thomas Dallmeyer's new telephoto lens. Between 1906 and 1913 he was informally tutored by Henry James in the typology of cities for the purpose of providing frontispieces for the collected New York edition of James's novels. Boyish but bearded, he appeared at the time of his most creative work like a young Whistler or William Morris, top-hatted but craftsman-like.<br>
<br>In 1909 Coburn and his mother moved from Guilford Street to 9 Lower Mall, Hammersmith, where he set up two printing presses to apply hard-won skills learned at the London County Council School of Photo-Engraving, Bolt Court. In the period 1909&#150;14 he etched and steel-faced eighty-three plates, and oversaw the printing of some 40,000 hand-pulled gravures for his books <span class="italic">London</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">New York</span> (1910), his illustrations for H. G. Wells's <span class="italic">The Door in the Wall</span> (1911), and his portraits for <span class="italic">Men of Mark</span> (1913). His true medium was photogravure, though his gum-platinum exhibition photographs are among the finest produced in the history of photography.<br>
<br>In 1911 Coburn visited Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, and in 1912 he published in Los Angeles six photographs to illustrate Shelley's <span class="italic">The Cloud</span>. On 11 October 1912 in Trinity Church, 25th Street, New York, he married Edith Wightman Clement (<i>d</i>. 1957) of Boston, with his mother and the verger as the only witnesses; they then returned to England, and Coburn never visited the United States again. The couple had no children: it is possible that Coburn settled for an asexual but devoted marriage in response to a troubled sense of sexual identity. Closely attracted (and attractive) to Day, James, Edward Carpenter, and George Bernard Shaw, he may have shared their less than clear sexual preferences.<br>
<br>Coburn attempted to modernize his symbolist sensibility in 1917 by making and exhibiting a series of prism-like images which he called vortographs, and devoted a great deal of time to the mechanical piano, the pianola. But he maintained his long-standing interest in the occult and derived deep satisfaction from becoming a freemason in 1919. He became a Mark mason and Royal Arch mason in 1921 and eventually achieved mastership in his two lodges. In 1922 he joined the Rosicrucian Society. But the definitive change in his life came in 1923 when he met a man who taught him the practice of quietist contemplation; in accordance with principles of anonymity and impersonality, this man's name remains unknown to those not of the hermetic society called the Universal Order. Coburn was an anonymous contributor to its journal, the <span class="italic">Shrine of Wisdom</span> (1919&#150;47).<br>
<br>In 1930, after destroying 15,000 photographic negatives and giving a collection of photographs to the Royal Photographic Society, Coburn moved to Harlech, Merioneth. On 24 May 1932 he was naturalized as a British subject. In 1935 he was appointed a lay reader in the Church in Wales, and in 1940 became honorary secretary of the joint county committee of Merioneth of the British Red Cross Society and the order of St John of Jerusalem. In 1945 the Coburns moved from Harlech to Denbighshire. Edith died on 11 October 1957, on their forty-fifth wedding anniversary, and Coburn on 23 November 1966 at their home, Awen, 17 Ebberstone Road East, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire. After a service at St George's Church, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, he was buried in the churchyard of Llandudno, Caernarvonshire, with masonic prayers being said at the graveside.<br>
