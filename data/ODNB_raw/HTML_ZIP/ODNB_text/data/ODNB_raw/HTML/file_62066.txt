<span class="headword">Hewetson,  Christopher</span>  (1737/8&#150;1798), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of Christopher Hewetson JP (<i>d</i>. 1744) and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Hewetson of Cloughsutton, co. Carlow. The Hewetson family can be traced back to Christopher Hewetson, an Elizabethan gentleman who settled in Ireland. His son, also Christopher, was MP for Swords, 1642&#150;61, and served Charles I during the civil war, for which he was awarded a grant of the watermills, fairs, and markets at Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, and 500 acres in 1666. The Hewetsons continued in public service: Christopher Hewetson's father served as a lieutenant in the troop of horse before becoming justice of the peace for co. Kilkenny. The death of Hewetson's father in June 1744 seems to have precipitated a decline in the family's fortunes, and the family estate was inherited by Amyas Hewetson, Christopher's half-brother from his father's first marriage to Eleanor Bushe. In September 1745 Christopher Hewetson enrolled at Kilkenny College, giving his age as eight years. His uncle, the Revd Thomas Hewetson, was master at the college, which may explain the privileged education despite the financial problems within the family. He is said to have then studied under John van Nost the younger (<i>c</i>.1712&#150;1780), the leading monumental sculptor in Dublin at the time. Nothing more is known of his early training.<br>
<br>Hewetson is recorded as arriving at Rome in 1765 with the American painter Henry Benbridge (1743&#150;1812). He was to remain in the city until his death, leaving only for brief visits to Naples in 1766 and 1797. With the assistance of Thomas Jenkins, by then established as the most influential art dealer and agent active within the British community at Rome, Hewetson attracted the patronage of the most fashionable and famous British and Irish grand tourists. His earliest busts included Charles Townley (1769; BM), Frederick Hervey, bishop of Derry and earl of Bristol (<i>c</i>.1770; NPG), and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (1769; NG Ire.). His terracotta portrait of the duke of Gloucester was reported in the London press (<span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>). The bust is now in the Royal Collection at Windsor. These early pieces exhibit the highly refined technique, and the naturalistic treatment of the sitters' features within a classical format, that were hallmarks of his work.<br>
<br>In 1771 Hewetson received the commission for his best-known work, the monument to Provost Baldwin for the examination hall of Trinity College, Dublin. This occupied him for twelve years, and the monument was finally erected in Dublin in 1784, having been exhibited in Rome the previous year. This was the sculptor's only large-scale monument. During these years, Hewetson's reputation as a maker of portrait busts rose among a truly international clientele, which included the papal authorities. His most notable commissions included the monument to Cardinal Giambattista Rezzonico (1783&#150;6; San Nicolo in Carcere, Rome) and portrait busts of Pope Clement XIV (the earliest version, dated 1771, at Beningbrough Hall, Yorkshire), the Spanish ambassador Don Jos&eacute; Nicolas de Azara y Perera (1779; Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine, Paris), and the Scottish painter Gavin Hamilton (1784; Glasgow University). In 1786 he exhibited the bust of Hamilton at the Royal Academy in London, and in 1790 he exhibited a bust of &#145;A Nobleman&#146; at the same institution. The bust of Hamilton appears in the portrait of Hewetson by Sefano Tofanelli (Wallraf Richartz Museum, Cologne).<br>
<br>Although at first considered a serious rival to Antonio Canova (1757&#150;1822), who started working in Rome in 1779 and quickly became the most acclaimed sculptor of the period, Hewetson's practice seems to have declined in later years. In 1789&#150;90 he produced a colossal marble bust of Leibniz (Leibniz Haus, Hanover) and he received commissions from Prince Augustus and Frederick Hervey, now fourth earl of Bristol, in the 1790s. He continued to play an active part in Rome's artistic community, signing the letter of thanks addressed to Prince Augustus by British artists in Rome in 1794, following his part in arranging tax relief for artists' imports into Britain. His name appears in the lists of artists circulated in Rome at the time. In 1796 he was commissioned by Lord Bristol to produce a statue of William Pitt, Lord Chatham. This was never completed. With the threatened invasion of Rome by the French, Hewetson fled to Naples in June 1797 where he enjoyed the protection of Sir William and Emma Hamilton. He returned to Rome at the end of that year and died there in 1798. He was recorded as a bachelor at death and was buried near the tomb of Caius Cestius at Rome.<br>
