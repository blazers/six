<span class="headword">Chase,  William St Lucien</span>  (1856&#150;1908), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, eldest son of Captain Richard Henry Chase of the control department of the War Office, was born in St Lucia, West Indies, on 21 August 1856. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and commissioned lieutenant in the 15th foot on 10 September 1875, joining the Bombay staff corps on 31 May 1878. He served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, taking part in the defence of Kandahar. During the sortie from Kandahar on 16 August 1880 against the village of Deh Khoja, he and Private T. E. Ashford (Royal Fusiliers) rescued a wounded soldier, carrying him over 200 yards under fire. For this they both were awarded the Victoria Cross (4 October 1881) and were mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Chase served with the Zhob valley expedition in 1884 as deputy assistant quartermaster-general, and was again mentioned in dispatches. From 1 November 1882 to 10 December 1887 he was deputy assistant adjutant-general, Bombay. Promoted captain on 10 September 1886, he was appointed on 28 August 1889 wing commander of the 28th Bombay native infantry (Pioneers). He took part in the Chin-Lushai expedition in 1889&#150;90, and was mentioned in dispatches. Promoted major on 10 September 1895, he served on the north-west frontier in 1897&#150;8 against the Mohmands, and in the Tirah campaign of 1897&#150;8, taking part in the capture of the Sampagha Pass, in the operations at and around Datoi, in the action of 24 November 1897, and in the operations in the Bara valley, 7&#150;11 December 1897.<br>
<br>On 10 June 1899 Chase became commander of the 28th Bombay native infantry, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1901 he married Dorothy, daughter of Charles Edward Steele, district magistrate of Hyderabad. He was nominated CB in 1903. Later he became assistant adjutant-general, Quetta division, and was on leave when promoted to command the Fyzabad brigade. He returned to Quetta, where he died of brain disease on 30 June 1908.<br>
