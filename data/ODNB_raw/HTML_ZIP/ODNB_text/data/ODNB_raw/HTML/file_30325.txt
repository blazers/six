<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Abraham,  Charles John</span>  (1814&#150;1903), <span class="occ">bishop of Wellington, New Zealand</span>, born on 17 June 1814 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was the second son of Captain Thomas Abraham of the 16th regiment, who was on the staff there, and Louisa Susannah, daughter of Edward Carter of Portsmouth. After attending Dr Thomas Arnold's school at Laleham, he went in 1826 to Eton College as an oppidan, but to save expenses he soon went into college, then half empty. He reached the sixth form, and played in the school cricket eleven. In 1833 Abraham went as a scholar to King's College, Cambridge, which then gave its own degrees without university examination in a tripos. Abraham was a good and accurate scholar, with a special memory for Horace and Homer, which he retained through life. He graduated BA in 1837 and succeeded to a fellowship at King's, which he held until 1849. He proceeded MA in 1840 and DD in 1859, and took the <i>ad eundem</i> degree of MA at Oxford on 14 June 1849.<br>
<br>Abraham was ordained deacon in 1838 and priest in 1839, and after entering on parochial work as curate of Headley Down, Hampshire, he returned to Eton in 1840 as a master. For nine years he threw himself heart and soul into Eton life. There were few masters and the classes were large and unwieldy; Abraham had more than ninety boys in his division. With George Augustus Selwyn, who was private tutor to the earl of Powis's sons at Eton and curate of Windsor, Abraham now began the friendship which determined his career. When in 1841 Selwyn became bishop of New Zealand, Abraham was anxious to follow him, but for the present the calls of Eton kept him at home. In the interests of the reform of the school he resigned the lucrative post of housemaster to become assistant master in college, in 1846, and was largely responsible for the rapid improvement in the moral tone of the King's scholars. He helped to modify the system of fagging, and repressed the old college songs. He widened the range of the curriculum, combining the teaching of history and geography and stimulating the boys' interest in history and literature. During this time he published several works, including <span class="italic">The Unity of History</span> (1845). The collegers regarded him as a kind adviser and friend, and in 1850 gave a font and cover to the college chapel as a tribute of their regard. His pupils included Edward Henry Stanley, fifteenth earl of Derby, to whom for a time he was private tutor at Knowsley, and Lord Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne Cecil, later third marquess of Salisbury and prime minister, who visited him in New Zealand in 1852. In 1848 Abraham was appointed divinity lecturer of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and the following year, when he became BD at Cambridge, he published his <span class="italic">Festival and Lenten Lectures</span>.<br>
<br>Abraham left Eton at Christmas 1849 to join Bishop Selwyn in New Zealand. On 17 January 1850 he married Caroline Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1877), daughter of Sir Charles Thomas Palmer, bt, of Wanlip, Leicestershire. They arrived in Auckland harbour in July 1850. Selwyn at once put Abraham in charge, as chaplain and principal, of St John's College, Auckland, a small training college for Maori and English youths. In 1853 he was made archdeacon of Waitemata, with the oversight of a large district. He supported church and Maori rights against the settler interest.<br>
<br>Abraham visited England in 1857 for surgical treatment of an arm broken in a fall from his horse. While he was in England the new dioceses of Wellington and Nelson were constituted: Abraham was consecrated bishop of Wellington at Lambeth Palace on 29 September 1858, and his friend Edmund Hobhouse became bishop of Nelson. After returning to New Zealand, for twelve years Abraham was fully occupied in creating the machinery of his new diocese, the chief town in which had just been made the seat of government. He continued to take the Maori side and was a member of the &#145;missionary party&#146;, opposing settler attitudes and lobbying for the replacement of the governor, Thomas Gore Browne. He promoted Maori education and attempted to encourage Maori participation in church government.<br>
<br>In 1870 Abraham returned to England with Selwyn, who was appointed to the see of Lichfield, and owing to Selwyn's temporary failure of health became coadjutor-bishop. In 1872 he was collated to the prebendal stall of Bobenhall in Lichfield Cathedral, and in 1876 he was made a canon residentiary and precentor. He assisted in the revision of the medieval statutes of the cathedral, taught in the theological college, and was responsible for the fabric of the cathedral and improving the music. In 1875&#150;6 Abraham was also non-resident rector of Tatenhill, in Needwood Forest. A total abstainer, he was long a frequent speaker at meetings of the United Kingdom Alliance.<br>
<br>After Selwyn's death in April 1878, Abraham, with Bishop Edmund Hobhouse and Sir William Martin, organized, by way of memorial, Selwyn College, Cambridge, which was opened in October 1882 and of which he was a chief benefactor. Abraham worked with William Dalrymple Maclagan, Selwyn's successor at Lichfield, until 1890, when he resigned his canonry, thenceforth living with his only son, the Revd Charles Thomas Abraham (later bishop of Derby), first at Christ Church, Lichfield, until 1897, and afterwards at Bakewell, Derbyshire. He died on 4 February 1903 at Bakewell vicarage, and was buried at Over Haddon churchyard. A memorial was placed in Eton College chapel.<br>
