<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dixon, Sir  Owen</span>  (1886&#150;1972), <span class="occ">judge in Australia</span>, was born on 28 April 1886 at Glenferrie Road, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia, the only child of Joseph William Dixon (1859&#150;1929), a Melbourne lawyer, and his wife, Edith Annie (1859&#150;1934), daughter of Edward Owen. Both parents came from Morley in Yorkshire, emigrating separately with their parents in the 1860s. He was educated at Hawthorn College and the University of Melbourne where he graduated as bachelor of arts in 1906 and bachelor of laws in 1908.<br>
<br>Dixon read classics and law. He was much influenced by T. G. Tucker, professor of classical philology, from whom he acquired a love of classical literature and thought that nourished his naturally sceptical mind, and by Sir William Harrison Moore, professor of law, in whom he observed the detachment of the scholar's judgement on modern problems, particularly in public law. He began practice at the Victorian bar in 1910. Dixon soon acquired a reputation for knowledge and skill as a barrister, obtaining an enormous practice and achieving a dominance not seen before or since. &#145;His quiet and friendly personality, his high standards of professional probity and his powerful mind dominated the Bar&#146;  (Dean, 219).<br>
<br>On 8 January 1920 at St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, Dixon married Alice Crossland Brooksbank (1893&#150;1971), daughter of the Revd H. A. Brooksbank. He was greatly attached to his wife and kept in constant contact with her whenever they were separated. They had two sons and two daughters, all of whom survived them. He took silk in 1922 and in that year made the first of several appearances before the privy council. He made a profound impression on many English lawyers. Sir John Simon suggested that he should take chambers in London and practise at the English bar, but for professional and personal reasons he decided not to do so. In 1926 Dixon agreed to sit for some months as an acting judge of the supreme court of Victoria. In that period he delivered some important judgments but declined permanent appointment at the end of the year.<br>
<br>In 1929 Dixon was persuaded to accept appointment to the high court, the highest court in Australia with both constitutional and appellate jurisdiction. It was there that his greatness became permanently recognized. He at once began to make a profound contribution to the law which can only be fully appreciated by a close study of his judgments. He believed deeply in Maitland's dictum that the common law was a reflection of &#145;strict logic, and high technique, rooted in the Inns of Court, rooted in the Year Books, rooted in the centuries&#146;  (SeldS year book series, 1.xviii).<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1939 Dixon offered his services to the government and while continuing to discharge judicial duties undertook the chairmanship of various government boards. In 1942 he accepted appointment as Australian minister to Washington and was relieved of judicial duties. His tasks were considerable and exacting. He worked closely with the heads of the administration and formed friendships that lasted throughout his life, in particular with Justice Frankfurter. He returned to Australia in 1944. Later he formed a close friendship with Lord Simonds with whom he corresponded regularly.<br>
<br>Dixon was once again absent from judicial duties when, in 1950, he was asked by the Security Council of the United Nations to act as mediator between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. He was received with respect by the disputants, who appreciated his judicial approach, but he failed to devise an acceptable solution for the region's intractable problems.<br>
<br>On 21 April 1952 Dixon was appointed chief justice of the high court of Australia and there began a period during which the court was regarded as the finest in the English-speaking world. He found judicial work hard and unrewarding but through the work of the court he had a profound influence on the standards of all courts in Australia. The intellectual penetration and meticulous legal scholarship of his judgments set standards for all and his insistence that the court should sit in all state capitals and avoid permanent residence in Canberra kept them to the fore.<br>
<br>Dixon firmly believed that the judicial task required the application by strict logic and high technique of external standards to ascertained facts. He strove to maintain the unity of the common law but continually faced the dilemma of whether to eradicate error or maintain legal and judicial authority. Some of his most interesting judgments are those concerned with that dilemma, <i>Mayfair Trading Co. Pty Ltd v. Dreyer</i> (1958), for example. He regretted that he had to make the pronouncement he did in <i>Parker v. R.</i> (1963). Many of his judgments have had a profound effect on legal thought in the common-law world: for example, in the field of estoppels see <i>Thompson v. Palmer</i> (1933); <i>Newbon v. City Mutual Life Assurance</i> (1935); and <i>Grundt v. Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd</i> (1937). His address, &#145;Concerning judicial method&#146; (delivered at Yale in 1955 and published with other papers and addresses under the title <span class="italic">Jesting Pilate</span>, 1965), was written in response to what he considered the unsatisfactory reasoning in recent English cases. That address is a masterly exposition of the judicial technique and shows his convictions and his humility. No understanding of his work can be complete without a study of it. In revenue cases <i>Sun Newspapers Ltd</i> (1938), <i>Hallstroms Pty Ltd</i> (1946), and <i>Ronpibon Tin NL</i> (1949), Dixon analysed the concepts of capital and income in the context of deductible outgoings in a way not previously attempted. His judgment in <i>National Research Development Corporation</i> (1959) developed the principles applicable in determining patentable processes. His judgment in <i>McDonald v. Dennys Lascelles Ltd</i> (1933) concerning the right of an innocent party to a sale of land to recover damages on the contract being terminated by an accepted repudiation was followed by the House of Lords in <i>Johnson v. Agnew</i> (1980). His judgment in <i>Birmingham v. Renfrew</i> (1937) concerning the position of the survivor of persons who make mutual wills has also been much referred to in English courts.<br>
<br>In public and in court Dixon was reserved and circumspect: in private he was irreverent and sometimes indiscreet. Tall, slightly stooped, loose-limbed, with an unusual physiognomy, he led a frugal life and was a teetotaller. He was excellent company. He trusted his friends to treat his conversation as it was intended. He frequently discussed a most serious subject with an extraordinary lightness of touch, almost with flippancy, but generally because he was confident of his own capacity to deal with it. Typical of his sardonic wit was his comment that the Australian constitution had contrived to combine the most difficult features of both the British and the American systems: in Britain there was a totally flexible constitution and utterly rigid judges; in America there was a rigid constitution and totally flexible judges; but unhappily in Australia both the constitution and the judges were equally strict. Similarly he observed that the principal reason for having trial by jury is the experience of what happens when there is a trial by judge alone and the principal reason for having trial by a judge alone is the experience of what happens when there is a trial by jury. Above all he was amused by evidence of human foibles in any form. Although shy by nature he had a great interest in people and enjoyed conversation, especially with those of a younger generation to whom he was particularly kind and generous.<br>
<br>Dixon retired on 13 April 1964 and took no part in public life thereafter. At his farewell Sir Robert Menzies said that two lord chancellors and a distinguished justice of the supreme court of the United States had described him as the greatest judicial lawyer in the English-speaking world. Dixon received many appointments and honours: KCMG in 1941, privy councillor in 1951, GCMG in 1954, the Howland memorial prize of Yale University in 1955, an honorary DCL from Oxford and an honorary LLD from Harvard in 1958, an honorary LLD from Melbourne in 1959, in 1963 the Order of Merit, an honorary LLD from the Australian National University in 1964, and in 1970 he became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy. Lady Dixon died in September 1971 and thereafter as Dixon's own health further declined, he declined in spirit also and died at his home, Yallambee, 4 Higham Road, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia, on 7 July 1972. He was buried in Boroondara cemetery, Kew, Victoria, on 11 July.<br>
