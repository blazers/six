<span class="headword">Cu&aacute;n ua Lothch&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1024), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet</span>, is variously designated Ireland's &#145;chief poet&#146; (<i>pr&iacute;m&eacute;ices</i>, in, for example, the annals of Ulster, or <i>ardfhili</i>, in the annals of Inisfallen) and &#145;chief historian&#146; (<i>pr&iacute;mshenchaid</i>, in the annals of Tigernach) in his obituary notices. There are no reliable data concerning his background or career: his family name is twice given as &#145;ua Leoch&aacute;in&#146;, suggesting a connection with the petty kings of Luigne in Meath; but this variant is too isolated to justify preferring it to the standard form. The annals of Clonmacnoise, surviving only in a seventeenth-century English translation, record a tradition that after the lapse of the high-kingship in 1022 Ireland was governed by Cu&aacute;n together with one Corc&aacute;n Cl&eacute;irech, &#145;like a free state, &amp; not like a monarchy&#146;; whatever the origin of this fantastic doctrine, it can have no historical basis.<br>
<br>Most of the poems plausibly attributed to Cu&aacute;n deal with the lore of places in the midlands: &#145;A ch&oacute;emu cr&iacute;che Cuind chain&#146;, on Tailtiu in Meath, &#145;At&aacute; sund carn u&iacute; Chathbath&#146;, on Carn Furbaide near Granard, &#145;Druim Criaich, c&eacute;te c&eacute;t cuan&#146;, on Drumcree, Westmeath, and &#145;S&iacute;d Nechtain sund forsint shl&eacute;ib&#146;, on the River Boyne, have all been edited by E. Gwynn  (Gwynn, vols. 3 and 4); &#145;Temair Breg, baile na fian&#146; and &#145;Temair, toga na tulach&#146;, both on Tara, have been edited by M. Joynt and by E. Gwynn  (Gwynn, vol. 1); and a poem on the Shannon, &#145;S&aacute;erainm Sinna saigid d&uacute;n&#146;, may also be his work  (Gwynn, vol. 3). Besides the antiquarian topics with which they purport to be primarily concerned, some of these poems deal with the reign of M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac Domnaill (high-king of Ireland 980&#150;1002, 1014&#150;22), evidently Cu&aacute;n's principal patron. &#145;Druim Criaich&#146; asserts the principle that the high-kingship should never pass from father to son, in justification of M&aacute;el Sechnaill's own succession; while &#145;A ch&oacute;emu&#146; praises him for reviving the royal assembly at Tailtiu in 1007, and calls him &#145;chosen king of Tara &hellip; river Euphrates surging aloft, sole warrior of Europe&#146;. Other poems describe the origin of M&aacute;el Sechnaill's dynasty (&#145;Temair Breg&#146;, where Tara is called &#145;a second Rome&#146;) and the exemplary rule of his legendary ancestor Cormac mac Airt (&#145;Temair, toga&#146;). In the only surviving non-toponymic composition, &#145;A fhir iadas in tech&#146; (edited by M. Dillon), the poet asks to be admitted to Tara on the strength of his knowledge of the things which are lucky and unlucky for the king. Cu&aacute;n seems, however, also to have courted the favour of lesser figures: his poem on Drumcree includes a quatrain praising Lachtna mac Taidc, an otherwise forgotten member of the local dynasty of the U&iacute; Gadra of Luigne.<br>
<br>The annals of Ulster, closely followed by most of the other annals which speak of his death, state that Cu&aacute;n was killed in the region of Tethba, Westmeath: &#145;in the same hour the company which had killed him putrified; that was a poet's miracle&#146;. A more realistic account is provided by the annals of Inisfallen: &#145;the man who killed him was killed immediately, i.e. the son of Gilla Ult&aacute;in son of Rodub&#146;. If Cu&aacute;n's murderer was a nephew of the Fiachra, son of Rodub, who killed the lord of Tethba in 995, this would make him a member of the Muinter Maelshinna: this was in fact a Tethba family, occupying the barony of Kilkenny West in Westmeath; and the name Gilla Ult&aacute;in occurs elsewhere in its pedigree. The background of the poet's death in 1024 is impossible to recover in detail, but its broader outlines can be surmised: the petty kingdoms of the western midlands were at this time exceptionally violent and chaotic, and there would have been nothing to protect Cu&aacute;n there after the passing of his great patron and the eclipse of the national monarchy to which he had aspired.<br>
