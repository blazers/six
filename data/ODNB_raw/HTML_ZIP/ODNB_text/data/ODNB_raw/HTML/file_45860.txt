<span class="headword">Peisley <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Neale]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1718&#150;1757), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born on 19 January 1718 at Ballymore, co. Kildare, the eldest of the three children of Peter Peisley (1694&#150;1754), a farmer of nearby Baltiboys, co. Wicklow, and his first wife, Rachel Burton, a native of Mannin, co. Tipperary, who died when Mary was a child. The family moved in 1723 to the Queen's county and occupied a 300 acre farm at Paddock, near Mountrath, where Peter married in 1727, as his second wife, Anna Pim (1697&#150;1768) of Lacka, with whom he had six further children. Their modest cottage home remained Mary's base for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>The Peisley family had strong links with the pioneering days of Quakerism. Mary's great-grandfather Peter Peisley (1624&#150;1689), a native of Ascot under Wychwood in Oxfordshire, was involved in a dispute over tithe payments in 1649, even before Quakerism reached Ascot, and later moved to Ireland; he settled in co. Wicklow, first at Poolanarrick, where a Quaker meeting was established on his farm in 1668, and secondly at Baltiboys, where another early Quaker meeting was established. His descendants had maintained the Quaker testimonies in their original purity, and in Mary's day, when Irish Quakers were becoming more worldly, the Peisleys continued to live plainly and visitors to Paddock were delighted by the family's &#145;instructive conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Account</span>, 6).<br>
<br>Mary, who lacked &#145;the privilege of a liberal education&#146;, found employment in various affluent households  (<span class="italic">Some Account</span>, 308). Aged twenty-six, and following a near fatal riding accident, she was converted to the religious life, and started to speak in Quaker meetings in 1744. Thereafter she embarked on a programme of self-denial and of purification through suffering, preaching against the dangers of wealth and the decline in Quaker spirituality, and seeing herself as a &#145;sharp threshing instrument&#146;  (ibid., 314), and as a &#145;pipe&#146; through which God's message might be channelled  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Following a short Irish tour in 1746 with the Limerick Quaker Elizabeth Tomey, Mary paid a long religious visit to England (1748&#150;50), accompanied initially by Elizabeth Hutchinson, and later by Mary Weston and others. Guided and fortified by her faith she braved physical danger and hardship, covering 5000 miles on horseback in 29 months and attending 525 meetings. Her preaching was succinct and powerful, and her prophesyings remarkable when &#145;ministering to the state&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Account</span>, 261) of individuals, whether in public or at private family opportunities. Mary's impact as a preacher, recorded in a verse &#145;To M.P. a Native of Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 20, 1750, 86), was no doubt enhanced by her physical presence &#145;being near 6 foot&#146;  (ibid.). The rigours of this trip seriously affected her health. Another short Irish tour followed in 1751 and, while visiting Cork, her then companion, Catherine Payton, was instrumental in converting <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19826/', "Samuel Neale (1729&#150;1792)")</script>, a paper manufacturer and Mary's future husband, to the religious life. He eventually became a Quaker minister.<br>
<br>Mary's final and most important religious journey, to America (1753&#150;6), was again undertaken with Catherine Payton; before leaving England they had both been part of a group of six women who proposed to the London yearly meeting that a separate yearly meeting of women Friends should be established (this was not granted until 1784). Mary and Catherine landed at Charles Town, South Carolina, on 26 December 1753 and, travelling often through thinly inhabited country, braving dangerous creeks, swamps, and wild animals, they covered 8000 miles on horseback before they arrived back in Dublin on 19 July 1756. They laboured in the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, New England, and Pennsylvania. Everywhere they found &#145;the discipline sadly let fall&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Account</span>, 343) and they were among the first to preach reform. Mary opposed Friends' ownership of slaves and pointedly held meetings with black people. She urged all Friends to avoid worldliness, particularly in politics, and complained about some Friends' deistical beliefs. She returned home with a certificate of approbation from American Friends, recording how &#145;acceptable and serviceable her labours had been amongst them&#146;.<br>
<br>Aged thirty-nine, Mary married Samuel Neale at Mountrath on 17 March 1757, but she died unexpectedly, of &#145;cholic&#146;, three days later at Paddock; her body was interred locally, at the Quaker burial-ground, Mountrath, on 24 March.<br>
