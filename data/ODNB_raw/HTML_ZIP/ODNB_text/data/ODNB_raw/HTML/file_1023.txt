<span class="headword">Badham,  Charles</span>  (1813&#150;1884), <span class="occ">classical scholar and promoter of education</span>, was born on 18 July 1813 at Ludlow, Shropshire, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1022/', "Charles Badham (1780&#150;1845)")</script>, regius professor of medicine in the University of Glasgow from 1827 and amateur classicist, and his first wife, Margaret Campbell, a relation of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32270/', "Lewis Campbell (1830&#150;1908)")</script>, Greek scholar and one of Badham's obituarists.<br>
<br>Because of his father's long periods in Europe as physician to English travellers, and his distrust of British schooling, Badham was educated first under Pestalozzi at Yverdun, where he became Pestalozzi's favourite pupil and began his mastery of both classical and modern languages. He was next a pupil in England of Dr Charles Mayo, formerly chaplain at Yverdun, and then at Eton of the famous classical teacher E. C. Hawtrey. In 1831 he entered Wadham College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1837 but with only third-class honours because, the family believed, the teaching did not suit his independent temperament; he took his MA in 1839.<br>
<br>The foundation and direction of Badham's Greek scholarship were formed during seven years of travel and study of manuscripts in European libraries, chiefly Italian; he began acquaintance with many scholars, especially the eminent Grecist G. C. Cobet of Leiden, who became a lifelong friend. In 1846 Badham returned to England and was incorporated MA at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he went because of the Cambridge tradition of textual scholarship, and took holy orders (deacon 1846, priest 1848) to qualify himself for a college fellowship. He was always to be disappointed, however, and his marriage in January 1848 to Julia Matilda, daughter of John Smith of Dulwich Common, further prevented his election owing to the celibacy restrictions then in force. He failed also to gain preferment in the church, despite taking the degree of DD in 1852. His religious liberalism made him suspect, his friendship with F. D. Maurice in particular being held against him; his irascibility was also alleged. He achieved only headmasterships of minor schools, at Southampton (1851), Louth (1854), and Edgbaston proprietary school, Birmingham (1856), patronized largely by nonconformist parents. In Birmingham he won the esteem of the future Cardinal Newman. In 1857 after the death of his first wife, with whom he had a son and a daughter, Badham married his second wife, Georgiana Margaret Wilkinson, with whom he had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Recognition of Badham's scholarship came more quickly on the continent than at home and in 1860 Cobet secured him an honorary DLitt at Leiden. In 1863, however, he was appointed to the prestigious post of external examiner in classics to the University of London, where the lexicographer Dr W. Smith was among his colleagues. Smith liked him personally and perceived his quality, describing him as &#145;the greatest of our living scholars&#146; in an unsigned article, &#145;Dr. Badham and the Dutch school of critics&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (120, 1866, 324&#150;55). In 1867 the University of Sydney, Australia, was looking deliberately in England for a new professor of classics and logic. Badham accepted appointment, with a panoply of testimonials from home and abroad (including Cobet, Newman, Smith, and W. H. Thompson, master of Trinity College, Cambridge; some are cited in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>). Others' lack of judgement or their hostility denied Badham a comparable post in England, a wrong memorably expressed by A. E. Housman: &#145;the one English scholar of the mid-century whose reputation crossed the Channel &hellip; but at home was excluded from academical preferment, set to teach boys at Birmingham, and finally transported to the Antipodes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manilius</span>, I, 1937, xlii).<br>
<br>Badham's excellence as a Greek scholar lay in acute textual conjecture, in the highest tradition of philology. He set out his principles in the introductions to his editions of Euripides' <span class="italic">Ion</span> and <span class="italic">Helen</span> (both 1851) and in prefatory letters to those of Plato's <span class="italic">Euthydemus and Laches</span> (1865), <span class="italic">Symposium</span> (1866), and <span class="italic">Philebus</span> (1878). He insisted on firmness towards texts demonstrably corrupt through scribal confusion, interference, or interpolation. Decrying vain conservatism, he advocated common sense as the foundation of critical method in general (<span class="italic">Criticism Applied to Shakespeare</span>, 1866, a pamphlet). Thompson wrote of him as &#145;a better emender than Porson, but lacking Porson's caution&#146;  (Badham and Campbell, 97). The &#145;Prefatory letters&#146; contain illustrative emendations to both Greek dramatists and prose writers. Badham also published long series of papers on the text of Herodotus, Thucydides, and Plato (<span class="italic">Laws</span>) in the Dutch journal <span class="italic">Mnemosyne</span>, and on these and other authors in German periodicals, but very little in British journals.<br>
<br>In Australia, Badham and his family found the climate congenial and he responded immediately to a society without inbred hierarchies and to a young university without religious conformism. At home, the routines of schoolteaching had frustrated him; but now he had an academic position, there was paradoxically much less time for scholarship. Instead, there was endless opportunity for Badham's ideals and energy as promoter of education, and for powers of organization, advocacy, and influence hardly needed or perceived in England. For the rest of his life he worked selflessly to enhance the university's standing and funding. He crusaded for those disadvantaged for education through distance or poverty, persuading the New South Wales state government to provide bursaries and himself teaching by correspondence, and not only in classics. He urged opportunities for women students, and greater tolerance for non-Anglicans. For many years dean of arts and then of the new faculty of laws, and also principal, his last success in the university was to establish evening lectures for working people. He engaged forcefully in reform of the curriculum, examinations, and inspection in schools, arguing from direct experience of visits throughout the state. He put special weight on English language and literature, and developed proposals to encourage pupils towards &#145;either arts or science&#146; according to their natural inclination and talent&#151;ideas he had urged already in England (<span class="italic">Thoughts on Classical and Commercial Education</span>, 1864). His overriding ideal was to give all citizens &#145;together with a consciousness of being educated &hellip; a conscience&#146;. His work on the Birmingham library committee from 1860 to 1867 qualified him as trustee and tireless chairman of the Sydney Free Public Library from its foundation in 1870 until his death. In all these activities he canvassed and cajoled, often at parliamentary level, wrote countless reports and papers, led by example, and exploited the influence of his offices in university and city. During a visit to Australia, Anthony Trollope captured his public image as &#145;the prince of professors and greatest of Grecians&#146;  (A. Trollope, <span class="italic">Australia</span>, 1873, chap. 2). The mixture in him of volatile temper, wit, eloquence, artistic taste, prodigious memory, and formidable intellect made him an exceptional personality. University, city, and state honoured him with a banquet on his seventieth birthday in 1883. His death on 27 February 1884 was announced by extraordinary public gazette, and government offices in Sydney closed to permit attendance at his funeral. He is buried under a simple stone in St Thomas's churchyard, north Sydney. His public speeches were admired and posthumously published.<br>
