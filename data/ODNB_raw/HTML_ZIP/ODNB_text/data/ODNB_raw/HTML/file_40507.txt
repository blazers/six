<span class="headword">Guthrie,  Matthew</span>  (1743&#150;1807), <span class="occ">physician and natural philosopher</span>, born on 24 March 1743, probably in Edinburgh, was the son of Hary Guthrie (1709&#150;1794), an Edinburgh lawyer of known Jacobite sympathies, and his first wife, Rachel Milne (1719&#150;1746). His grandfather was Gideon Guthrie (1663&#150;1732), a well-known Scottish Episcopalian minister. The historian William Guthrie (1708?&#150;1770) was his uncle. Matthew was the middle child, being flanked by an elder sister, Euphan, and a younger brother, William. Euphan's eldest daughter, Rachel (1759&#150;1852?), married John Robison (1739&#150;1805), who became professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh, and it was with Robison, who was secretary to Admiral Sir Charles Knowles, that Guthrie arrived in St Petersburg in the late summer of 1769. Before this Guthrie had been apprenticed to an Edinburgh surgeon, William Inglis; after serving at sea in the employ of the East India Company he decided on his return to Scotland in 1764 to take a course in medicine at the University of Edinburgh. His name appears, under the date 24 December 1764, in the class-list for &#145;Anatomy, Chemistry and Theory and Practice of Medicine&#146;. Among his teachers were John Hope, Robert Whytt, Alexander Monro secundus, William Cullen, and Joseph Black. Guthrie was also a friend of Andrew Duncan of the Medical Society of Edinburgh. It appears that he spent some time practising in London &#145;where his friends advisd him to goe to St Petersburgh where they hear there is great demand for people of his profession&#146;  (Cross, <span class="italic">By the Banks of the Neva</span>, 147). On his arrival in Russia, however, Guthrie was appointed only to the lowly level of lekar or surgeon, so he returned to Scotland to improve his qualifications and took the MA and MD degrees at St Andrews University on 16 April 1770, by virtue of testimonials signed by Thomas Young and Colin Drummond. This was a normal process for the time and Guthrie seems to have been a competent medical man.<br>
<br>Guthrie returned to Russia in 1770: his first appointment was to the admiralty (<i>admiralteystv-kollegiya</i>), and from there he was posted in 1772 as a surgeon to P. A. Rumyantsev's army corps in Moldavia and Wallachia, serving at the field marshal's headquarters at Jassy. He became involved with questions of quarantine and plague prevention, publishing a paper on the topic in <span class="italic">Medical and Philosophical Commentaries</span> (8, 1781). Until 1776 Guthrie travelled widely in the northern coastal territories of the Black Sea, a region in whose culture he developed a deep interest, as is manifested by his &#145;Noctes Rossicae&#146; in the British Library, and by his supplement to his wife's travel diary, published in 1802. Guthrie then returned to St Petersburg and in March 1778 became chief physician to the imperial land cadet corps of nobles. He was also appointed councillor of state to Tsar Paul, in the suite of the Tsarina Catherine the Great, and later to Alexander I, thereby entering the ranks of the Russian hereditary nobility.<br>
<br>In 1781 Guthrie made an influential marriage to a French widow, Marie Dunant, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Romaud-Survesnes (<i>d</i>. 1800), acting director of the imperial convent for the education of noblewomen in Russia. Guthrie wrote an account of the institution for the use of John Howard, the Quaker reformer; it is preserved in the archives of the Royal Society  (letters and papers, decade 7, no. 256). Guthrie and his wife had two daughters. The beautiful and vivacious Anastasia-Jessy (1782&#150;1855) married Charles Gascoigne (1738&#150;1806), then the most renowned iron-founder and engine builder in Russia. Guthrie's second daughter, Mary Elizabeth (1789&#150;1850), married General Sir James Hay (1765&#150;1837). Guthrie was variously described as &#145;the ubiquitous Dr. Matthew Guthrie&#146;  (John Howard); as &#145;pompous and pedantic&#146;  (William Coxe); as &#145;a gentleman of the most amiable manners, a philosopher and well known to the world for his various scientific and literary productions&#146;  (John Carr); and as &#145;a man of very clear ideas, perfectly acquainted with all the physical knowledge pursuing at present in England, a frequent correspondent with Priestley, Magellan and others of the English Philosophers and a man of inventive genius himself&#146;  (Samuel Bentham). Guthrie's house was a place of first resort for all English visitors with a taste for travel, science, medicine, natural history, and technology. He was also consulted by the Russian authorities on a variety of matters, including the copper-sheathing of the wooden hulls of the Russian navy, and the identification of foreigners who might be of use in Russia. He was elected to the Free Economic Society of St Petersburg in 1777. He was well known to Joseph Black, James Hutton, James Watt, Joseph Priestley, and, indeed, to most of the scientific literati of his time. Others of his acquaintance included the Portuguese industrial spy J. H. de Magellan; the Swiss F. X. Schwediaur and M. A. Pictet; the Scots engineer Charles Baird; and Sir John Sinclair. There is a delightful description of Guthrie's outdoor study in which he received several of these men in John Carr's <span class="italic">A Northern Summer</span> (1805, 326&#150;7).<br>
<br>Guthrie was an unceasing communicator of things scientific. Several of his publications arose from letters, such as one to John Hope  (<span class="italic">Medical and Philosophical Commentaries</span>, 4, 1776&#150;7); another to Andrew Duncan on the use of <span class="italic">Rhododendron chrysanthemum</span> for the treatment of gout and rheumatism  (ibid.); one to Joseph Priestley, &#145;On the antiseptic regimen of the natives of Russia&#146;  (Royal Society, London, letters and papers, decade 7, no. 8); and a communication to Richard Kirwan  (ibid., decade 8, no. 68) on the freezing-point of mercury, a subject about which he also wrote to Joseph Black. From 1792 to 1794 Guthrie contributed fifty pieces to James Anderson's <span class="italic">The Bee, or, Literary Weekly Intelligencer</span>. Most of these pieces were edited or translated by Guthrie from other writers such as P. S. Pallas, M. V. Lomonosov, and even Catherine the Great herself. He may have been the translator of Catherine's story &#145;Khlor&#146;, translated as &#145;Ivan Czarowitz, or, The Rose without Prickles, that Stings not&#146; in <span class="italic">The Bee</span> for 28 August and 11 September 1793; but he was certainly the translator of Catherine's opera <span class="italic">Oleg</span>, which he sent to his English publishers, Cadell and Davies, who decided not to publish it. In his correspondence with Joseph Black, Guthrie asked questions about the manufacture of steel. He also wrote letters to James Hutton, the great geologist, and exchanged mineral samples with him. Guthrie was a distinguished gemmologist, having a large collection of gems of his own and being well acquainted with the Russian royal collections, as well as other royal collections. Because of his links to Laxmann, he was able to give precise locations of Russian fossils and to provide contemporary Russian monetary values for gemstones.<br>
<br>Like other Scots doctors who preceded him in Russia, Guthrie disseminated rare plants and seeds, as well as common ones. Some of these were sent to John Hope, and to other collectors. Much of the stimulus to this work derived from P. S. Pallas and centred on medicinal plants, such as <i>Rhododendron chrysanthemum</i>, <i>Asafoetida</i>, and <i>Rheum palmatum</i>, but buckwheat and larch seed were also sent to Scotland from Russia. Besides these botanical matters Guthrie corresponded on textiles, animal husbandry, the prevention of scurvy, archaeology, geography, linguistics, ethnography, scientific instrumentation, and popular music, superstitions, and folklore. He collected specimens for geology, ornithology, ichthyology, entomology, and zoology.<br>
<br>Guthrie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 11 April 1782, was a member of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society, and a founder in November 1783 of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He became a corresponding member on 25 June 1752 of the societies of antiquaries of London and Edinburgh, and of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Commerce, and Manufactures; and corresponded with the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. He also belonged to the New Music Society (Novoye Muzykalnoye Obshchestvo) of St Petersburg from its foundation in 1778 to its demise in 1792, and was a friend of Ivan Prach, the composer, and N. P. Yakhontov, the court musician. One of his last publications was his edition in 1802 of his wife's travel diaries, to which he added notes of his own. He died in St Petersburg on 7 August 1807 and was buried next to his wife in the city's Smolensk churchyard.<br>
