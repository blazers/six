<span class="headword">Whitshed, Sir  James Hawkins</span>, first baronet  (1762&#150;1849), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in 1762, third son of James Hawkins (1713&#150;1805), bishop of Raphoe, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keene. The family fortune came from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68106/', "William Whitshed")</script>. In 1773 he was entered on the books of the sloop <i>Ranger</i>, then on the Irish station, and was afterwards on the books of the <i>Kent</i>, guardship at Plymouth. He first went afloat in the <i>Aldborough</i>, serving on the Newfoundland and North American stations, until on 4 September 1778 he was promoted lieutenant. During 1779 he was in the <i>Amazon</i>, on the home station, and in December he joined the <i>Sandwich</i>, flagship of Sir George Brydges Rodney, with whom he was present in the action off Cape St Vincent on 16 January 1780. At Gibraltar he was made commander in the sloop <i>San Vincente</i>, and, going out to the West Indies with Rodney, was present in the action of 17 April 1780; the next day, 18 April, he was posted to the <i>Deal Castle</i>, which, in a hurricane the following October, was blown from her anchorage at St Lucia and wrecked on the coast of Puerto Rico. The crew escaped to the shore, and Hawkins, after recovering from a dangerous fever brought on by exposure, was honourably acquitted by a court martial, and was sent to England with dispatches. In July 1781 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Ceres</i>, in which, the following spring, he took out Sir Guy Carleton to New York, and brought him back to England in December 1783. For the next three years Hawkins commanded the frigate <i>Rose</i> at Leith and on the east coast of Scotland. He then studied for three years at Oxford, attending lectures on astronomy, and travelled on the continent, mainly in Denmark and in Russia. In 1791 he assumed the name of Whitshed, that of his maternal grandmother, in accordance with a cousin's will.<br>
<br>Whitshed married, on 11 December 1791, Sophia Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 20 Jan 1852), daughter of Captain John Albert Bentinck RN (<i>d</i>. 1775), grandson of the first earl of Portland. They had two sons and four daughters. The eldest son was killed in 1813, when a midshipman of the <i>Berwick</i>. In 1793 Whitshed was appointed to the <i>Arrogant</i> (74 guns), one of the squadron under Rear-Admiral George Montagu in May and June 1794. In 1795 he was moved into the <i>Namur</i>, one of the ships which in January 1797 was detached from the Channel Fleet with Rear-Admiral William Parker (1743&#150;1802) to reinforce Sir John Jervis at Lisbon, and to take part in the battle of Cape St Vincent, for which Whitshed, with the other captains engaged, received the gold medal and the thanks of both houses of parliament. He afterwards commanded successively the <i>Ajax</i> (74 guns), and the <i>Formidable</i> (98 guns), in the Channel Fleet, and on 14 February 1799 was promoted rear-admiral. In April, with his flag in the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> (100 guns), he commanded a squadron of four ships of the line which was sent as a reinforcement to the Mediterranean Fleet, on the news of the French fleet's having escaped from Brest. In the pursuit he returned off Brest with Lord Keith. He continued in the channel, with his flag in the <i>T&eacute;m&eacute;raire</i> (98 guns), until 1801, and in 1803, on the renewal of the war, was appointed naval adviser to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, to superintend the arrangements for the defence of the Irish coast and to organize the sea fencibles. He became vice-admiral on 23 April 1804, and in the spring of 1807 was appointed commander-in-chief at Cork, where he remained for three years. On 31 July 1810 he was promoted admiral.<br>
<br>Whitshed was made a KCB on 2 January 1815, was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth from January 1821 to April 1824, was made a GCB on 17 November 1830, a baronet on 16 May 1834, baron of the kingdom of Hanover in 1843, and admiral of the fleet on 8 January 1844. He died at his house in Cavendish Square, London, on 28 October 1849. Whitshed's second son, St Vincent Keene (1801&#150;1870), succeeded to the baronetcy; on the death of his only surviving son in 1871 the baronetcy became extinct. The third baronet's only child and heir was Elizabeth Alice Frances Hawkins Whitshed, who married Frederick Burnaby, and was later Mrs Aubrey Le Blond [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52565/', "Le Blond, Elizabeth Alice Frances")</script>].<br>
