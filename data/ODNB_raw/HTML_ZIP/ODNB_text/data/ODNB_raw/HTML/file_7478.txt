<span class="headword">Steuart <span class="st"> [<em>later </em> Steuart Denham]</span>, Sir  James, of Coltness and Westshield</span>, third baronet  (1713&#150;1780), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 10 October 1713 in Edinburgh, the only son of the five children of Sir James Steuart, second baronet (1681&#150;1727), lawyer and politician in the first Union parliament, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Hew Dalrymple, lord president of the court of session. The foundations of the Steuart family fortunes had been laid by James Steuart (1608&#150;1681), a successful merchant who later became lord provost of Edinburgh. His son, James Steuart's grandfather, was appointed lord advocate in 1693 and was made a baronet two years later. With two estates at Coltness (near Glasgow) and Goodtrees (near Edinburgh), the family had apparently emerged from the conflicts of the seventeenth century with office but an uncertain political allegiance.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsandtheJacobiterisingof1745"></a>Early years and the Jacobite rising of 1745</h2>Young James passed his early years at Goodtrees and later attended the parish school at North Berwick. He entered Edinburgh University in 1725 and subsequently studied Scots law under Alexander Bayne and constitutional history with Charles Mackie. On the death of his father in 1727 he became third baronet. He made the expected progression from the university, and passed the bar examinations in 1735. Nothing seemed to stand in the way of what promised to be a successful, even brilliant career, whose start was merely postponed by the last phase of a gentleman's education: the foreign tour (1735&#150;40).<br>
<br>Steuart first travelled to the Netherlands with the intention of pursuing further study in the universities of Leiden and Utrecht. It is likely that Steuart and his constant companion, James Carnegy of Boysack, then moved on to France, where they visited Avignon. Still a papal territory, Avignon was at this time a refuge for those who had been &#145;out&#146; in the rising of 1715 and consequently something of a Jacobite centre. It was here that Steuart met the exiled duke of Ormond, an ardent supporter of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, who encouraged him to visit Spain with a view to contacting George Keith, the last Earl Marischal of Scotland, and later confidant of Frederick the Great.<br>
<br>The meetings with Ormond in Avignon and with the Earl Marischal in Spain may well have determined Steuart to travel on to Rome. He was certainly in that city in 1739, where his portrait was painted, and where there can be little doubt that he indulged his genuine taste for classical antiquities. But the visit proved fateful in that Steuart established the contacts for which Ormond and the Earl Marischal had hoped. In Rome he became a member of a prominent Jacobite club, the Young Gentlemen Travellers, and was described by one contemporary as the &#145;prettiest most agreeable little Cur that ever lived if he were not such a Jacobite&#146;  (Chamley, <span class="italic">Documents</span>, 37). Steuart was committed to the cause before he left Rome in 1739 and became further devoted to it in the years which followed. There is as yet no firm evidence as to Steuart's meetings in Rome, but it is known that he wrote to James Edgar, secretary to the Old Pretender, on 28 December 1739 <i>en route</i> home, and that the latter replied on 14 January acknowledging Steuart's compliments to the &#145;king&#146; and his commitment to the Jacobite cause. John Murray, secretary to Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, also wrote to Edgar about Steuart's loyalty (5 September 1743). Steuart was, he believed, &#145;deservedly liked by all his acquaintance&#146;  (Blaikie, 43), noting elsewhere that he was one &#145;of the most considerable of the King's friends, with whom I had frequent meetings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 113).<br>
<br>The summer of 1745 found Steuart at Coltness, but he returned to Edinburgh ostensibly to seek medical assistance for his wife, Lady Frances Wemyss, daughter of the earl of Wemyss, whom he had married on 25 October 1743. For a time events moved slowly, but on 16 September 1745 the Jacobite army was 2 miles from the city. Sir James initially made no overt move, and it was possibly not until the battle of Prestonpans had been won on 21 September that he publicly declared himself. Steuart's caution may be understandable, given that he was one of a number of supporters who believed that a successful action required 6000 regular troops, arms for 10,000, and 30,000 louis d'or. But Sir James knew of the lack of such support in 1745 and agreed to keep silent.<br>
<br>In the company of his brother-in-law, Henry, tenth earl of Buchan, Steuart went to Holyrood Palace, where the two men arrived, masquerading as prisoners of the Jacobite force. Prince Charles refused to meet them under such prudent conditions. Buchan left the palace and took no further action; Sir James remained. The die was now cast, and henceforth Steuart was busy. As a close relative, Elizabeth Mure, remarked, &#145;he was consulted in everything, he wrote the <span class="italic">Manifesto</span>, and several little things in the public papers&#146;. It is interesting to note that Mure should have attributed Steuart's commitment to an ambition thwarted by the Arniston interest: &#145;I look on this as the foundation of all his after conduct, for had that revolution taken place which he wished, he would have been the first man in the state&#146;  (Chamley, <span class="italic">Documents</span>, 16).<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortoFrance"></a>Ambassador to France</h2>Towards the end of October 1745, and just before the Jacobite march to Derby, it was decided to send an ambassador to the French court to replace George Kelly, one of the celebrated &#145;seven men of Moidart&#146;, the sole escort which had landed with the prince in Loch nan Uamh the previous July. Steuart left with the approval of Cameron of Lochiel and Lord George Murray, the Jacobite general, who considered him to be a &#145;very proper person&#146;  (Tomasson, 63). Curiously, Steuart departed from the port of Stonehaven, under conditions similar to those by which he had arrived at Edinburgh, namely as a captured officer of General Cope's defeated army, complete with the Hanoverian emblem of a black cockade. Steuart landed at Dunkirk and immediately went to see the intendant to enquire about preparations for an invasion of England. On 8 December he presented his credentials at Versailles. After the audience he was taken to Cardinal Tencin, to whom he explained the state of the prince's affairs, including the reasons for his march to Derby. It was in the course of this interview that Steuart rashly asserted that at least half the landed interest in England would support the Jacobite cause if French support was forthcoming.<br>
<br>Thus far Steuart had every reason to suppose that there would be effective help and appeared to be executing his commission with a fair measure of success. But despite the Jacobite victory at the battle of Falkirk on 17 January 1746 Steuart had begun to suspect that an invasion was less than probable. With this realization came rather sharper exchanges. During one conversation with the French minister Maurepas, Steuart pointed out that since the Jacobites had served the purposes of France in drawing English troops from Flanders, the French in turn had an obligation to the forces of Prince Charles. The minister readily recognized the intemperate nature of this exchange, and discounted it accordingly.<br>
<br>After the defeat of the Jacobite army at Culloden in April 1746 Steuart remained in Paris, issuing funds to the needy and informing Rome of new arrivals from Scotland. Steuart's continuing involvement with the prince's cause is also confirmed by the pointed terms of a commission which he received from the Young Pretender on 29 December 1746, entrusting him &#145;with full powers dated this day with the French court concerning our affairs&#146;  (Blaikie, 424). Steuart's second embassy also proved unsuccessful. Indeed, he had already written to the Old Pretender indicating that he had hopes of escaping the attainder and thus returning to Scotland. Sir James did avoid the attainder, but not the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>. Reconciled to exile, he moved to Sedan in 1747 and thereafter to Angoul&ecirc;me, where he stayed with his family for seven years. Lord Elcho recorded that Steuart spent some 12,000 livres a year, and that he kept &#145;the best establishment in the area&#146;. There was a constant run of company, as Steuart recalled, further enlivened by visits to Paris. Even so, Steuart was bored.<br>
<br>The visit of the exiled <i>parlement</i> of Paris in 1754 brought new contacts which were to change the direction of Steuart's life. From the members of the <i>parlement</i>, including Mercier de la Rivi&egrave;re (later a celebrated physiocrat), he procured a great deal of information as to the state of France; these meetings may have encouraged a return to more academic pursuits. It was during his stay at Angoul&ecirc;me that Steuart embarked upon his defence of Newton's <span class="italic">Chronology</span>, and probably upon the study of political economy.<h2>
<a name="Theendofexile"></a>The end of exile</h2>Steuart left Angoul&ecirc;me for Paris in 1754 at a time when Jacobite fortunes had all but evaporated. Even if still in sympathy with the cause, he obviously felt that he could now look to his own interest without embarrassment. Once in Paris, it was through the good offices of Mercier de la Rivi&egrave;re that Steuart met Montesquieu and probably Mirabeau, whose <span class="italic">Friend of Man</span> (1756) was one of the sources which influenced the shape of Steuart's future work. Steuart was still in Paris in May 1756 but appears to have departed for Brussels soon after in order to avoid compromising his position in the event of hostilities breaking out between France and Great Britain. He stayed in Brussels until the spring of 1756, and when his wife returned from a visit to London, where she had gone to see to the inoculation of their son, and to make a further application for a pardon, the family moved to Spa. It was here that he met Mr Burrage, the British envoy to the small courts of the Rhine, before settling at T&uuml;bingen, where the family spent four happy years. In this atmosphere Steuart found little difficulty in beginning to write what became his best-known work, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy</span>, the first two books of which were completed by summer 1759. The same year also saw the publication of <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Policy of Grain</span>, followed two years later by <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the German Coin</span>.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1758 Steuart set off on a tour through the Tyrol to Padua in search of relief from the gout which had plagued him while at Spa. His destination was Venice and it was here that he met Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. She proved to be a good friend, encouraging Sir James when he became depressed with his writing. She also tried hard to secure a pardon for him through the agency of lords Holdernesse, Barrington, and Bute. Holdernesse had instruments prepared for the king's signature which would have permitted Steuart to return to Britain, but his efforts were thwarted by George II's death in 1760.<br>
<br>In the following year the then secretary of war, Lord Barrington, who had met Steuart during his foreign tour, secured a cornetcy for Sir James's son, also James (1744&#150;1839) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7479/', "Denham, Sir James Steuart")</script>], in the Royal or 1st regiment of dragoons. With the problem of his son's career solved, there was now no further reason to stay in T&uuml;bingen. As it turned out, the decision to leave Germany was to involve Sir James in his last political adventure and, indirectly, to bring about his return to Britain. Steuart moved to Rotterdam, where he spent the winter of 1761&#150;2 while his wife travelled to London to see their son into the army and to make a further application for pardon. On her return the family went to live in Antwerp before returning to Spa for the sake of Sir James's health. But on 27 August, Steuart was arrested by the French and his house in Antwerp raided. One reason for the arrest, which was effected on neutral territory, was Steuart's well-known (and no doubt well-planned) expressions of satisfaction with the course of the Seven Years' War along with his intimate knowledge of French affairs. But a further telling motive is to be found in a subterfuge that would certainly have appealed to Sir James.<br>
<br>It appears that Steuart had been caught in possession of the coded plans for the seizure of Santo Domingo (Haiti); these plans had been prepared by Mercier de la Rivi&egrave;re &#145;who had a personal pecuniary interest in an English invasion of the island and may also have realised that it would do his friend Steuart no harm in the eyes of London if he were arrested by the French&#146;  (Chamley, <span class="italic">Documents</span>, 44&#150;6). As Paul Chamley has remarked: &#145;Steuart garda bien le secret&#146;  (ibid., 46). The French declined to release Steuart until after the peace of 1763. In the interval Sir James remained a prisoner, steadfastly refusing offers of employment just as he had previously refused similar offers in Germany.<br>
<br>Under the impression that Lady Frances had persuaded the British ministry to intercede on his behalf, Steuart hastened to London at the end of the war, only to discover that he was still regarded as a traitor&#151;no minor matter in view of the fate of Archibald Cameron only eight years earlier. During this time Steuart appears to have stayed with, and to have enjoyed the protection of, his old friend and benefactor, Lord Barrington.<h2>
<a name="PublicationofAnInquiryintothePrinciplesofPoliticalOeconomy1767"></a>Publication of An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy (1767)</h2>However precarious his position, Steuart set off for Scotland in order to put his remaining estate (Coltness) in order. There he found time for more than agricultural improvements. During this period he worked on the fourth book of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> and in particular on his analysis of Scottish banking practice. The <span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span> and the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> carried a large number of pamphlets and letters on the exchange crisis of the 1760s, especially with reference to the use of the optional clause in Scottish bank notes, and Sir James followed this literature closely. In 1764 he wrote a series of comments on two anonymous studies, the <span class="italic">Memorial on Scottish Banks</span> and <span class="italic">Thoughts Concerning Banks</span>, which had been sent to William Mure, baron of the Scots exchequer, by the Glasgow merchants Messrs Ingram and Glassford. By March 1766 Steuart's work was sufficiently advanced to justify a journey to London to enquire about publication. Steuart was not wanting in friends to give advice and encouragement. Shortly after his arrival in London William Rouet, professor of oriental languages at Glasgow, and a cousin of Mure's, wrote:<blockquote>George Scott and David Hume have looked unto our friend's MS and are exceedingly pleased with it. I begin to entertain further views from the publication of this ingenious performance than merely a sum from a bookseller; though this last is not yet touched upon [it] will be done soon. (Mure, 2.83)</blockquote>The work was completed by October and early in 1767 Steuart's <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy</span> appeared in two volumes costing 2 guineas. Again he received help from Rouet, who sent George Scott to see the editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> in search of a suitable commentator. They settled on &#145;Mr Bentley, merchant at Liverpool&#146; who produced an extensive and often sympathetic criticism of the work. The <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> was similarly complimentary, describing Steuart's aims as &#145;extensive and the execution laborious&#146;; yet it was also aware that this was a subject in its early stages of analysis: &#145;so little have the principles of political economy been investigated, that the grounds he works upon require to be cleared before they can be cultivated&#146;  (23.321). Less complimentary were the responses of James Boswell who thought the book &#145;irregular and fanciful&#146;, while David Hume, despite his initial favourable reaction, was said to be critical of the book's final &#145;form and style&#146;.<br>
<br>In his defence Steuart highlighted the difficulties involved in creating a &#145;composition&#146; which was the fruit of wide reading and &#145;many years spent in travelling&#146;  (Steuart, <span class="italic">Principles</span>, 1966, 1.4; 1998, 1.4). He wrote frequently in the first person singular, in effect involving the reader in a complex dialogue. Though this approach was criticized by Hume, it is essential that Hume's wider influence on the work is appreciated. The organizing principle of Steuart's study owed much to Hume's deployment of a historical method which enabled Sir James to conduct himself &#145;through the great avenues of this extensive labyrinth&#146;  (ibid., 1.29; 1.35).<br>
<br>Steuart's aim was to produce a great conceptual system, linking the most interesting branches of theory and policy, such as &#145;<i>population, agriculture, trade, industry, money, coin, interest, circulation, banks, exchange, public credit and taxes</i>&#146;. He added that:<blockquote>The principles deduced from all these topics, appear tolerably consistent; and the whole is a train of reasoning through which I have adhered to the connection of subjects as faithfully as I could. (Steuart, <span class="italic">Principles</span>, 1966, 1.7; 1998, 1.7)</blockquote>Steuart's attempt to produce a systematic treatise confirms that he sought to include economics in the broad body of organized science. In fulfilling this task he clearly differentiated economics from other social disciplines and formally set out and deployed the techniques of reasoning associated with the Newtonian method in building up a body of analysis which progressively increased in complexity.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Principles</span>, Steuart made notable contributions to economic theory: the historical analysis of the origins of the exchange economy, where he (like Adam Smith) was influenced by David Hume; to the theory of economic development with its emphasis on the importance of interdependent sectors; to the theory of competitive price, and, most notably, to the treatment of money and banking, where he showed his appreciation of banks as a means of mobilizing resources in countries undergoing the process of institutional, as well as economic, change. But it should be recalled that the first two books of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> had been completed in Germany by the summer of 1759; that is, prior to the dissemination of the physiocratic macro-economic model of a system using capital, later supplemented by a clear distinction between factors of production and categories of return. But despite detailed changes to the 1767 edition, most of which were incorporated in his collected <span class="italic">Works</span> (1805), and now in the 1998 edition, Steuart did not fundamentally change his approach, perhaps because he believed that the model of &#145;primitive accumulation&#146; continued to be relevant to the circumstances which he had encountered in Europe.<h2>
<a name="EconomicpolicyinthePrinciplesofPoliticalOeconomy"></a>Economic policy in the Principles of Political Oeconomy</h2>While Steuart's extensive knowledge of Scotland, France, Spain, Italy, and Germany may have had some impact on his analytical strategy, it certainly influenced his attitude to economic policy. He was aware, for example, that he confronted countries which were still undergoing the effects of transition to the exchange economy and the problems of regional unemployment. There was evidence of what might be termed structural unemployment in certain areas in all the countries with which he was familiar, all requiring positive action.<br>
<br>In the same way Steuart was aware of the imperfections in the markets for corn, arguing in favour of a managed market in the shape of a granary scheme. This argument, previously advanced in his <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Policy of Grain</span>, was later made use of in his <span class="italic">Considerations on the Interest of the County of Lanark in Scotland</span> (1769), published under the pseudonym Robert Frame. Here Steuart took the specific case of a regional economy with a view to illustrating general principles, arguing strongly for support of the local infrastructure and of agriculture&#151;especially in view of the proposed Forth and Clyde Canal. Protection for local agricultural interests would also be a theme of his contribution to the corn law debate of the late 1770s when the Glasgow merchants argued in favour of a reduction in the import price. But Sir James failed to influence the merchants: &#145;I have had conversations with the Glasgow theorists. I have written to them on the same subject, to no purpose&#146;  (Steuart, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.379). A decade on from the publication of the <span class="italic">Principles</span>, Steuart attributed the dismissal of his proposals in part to the influence of his &#145;rival in fame&#146;, Adam Smith, who &#145;has printed in favour of free importation &hellip; my opinions have little weight, they have been long printed, little read, and less considered&#146;  (Chamley, <span class="italic">Documents</span>, 140&#150;42). But it should be added that Steuart was not engaged in a dispute with Smith so much as with the mercantile interests which had abused his authority.<br>
<br>Steuart formally dropped the assumption of a closed economy in the second book of the <span class="italic">Principles</span>. Here he showed a clear understanding of the benefits of foreign trade to the countries engaged upon it. But the treatment is distinctive in that Steuart examined cases where trade may take place between countries with different institutional structures, manners, factor endowments, and levels of economic development, and varying rates of growth. Such perceptions suggested that economic policy should vary with the circumstances which prevailed  (cf. Tortajada, 1999).<br>
<br>Steuart reduced the possible variations to three: the stages of infant, foreign, and inland trade (bk 2, chap. 19). In the case of infant trade the strategy is one of protection with a view to encouraging domestic development. Where countries can effectively compete with one another, the appropriate policy is to encourage freedom of trade (including movement of gold). In the case of inland trade Steuart examined a case where relatively mature economies have lost their competitive edge. Here the appropriate policy is to protect domestic employment levels and to take such steps as may enable the economy in question to re-enter the international market.<br>
<br>Steuart is likely to have found evidence in support of this perspective in contemporary Europe. Analytically he would have found a precedent in Hume's <span class="italic">Political Discourses</span> (1752), while the identification of the stages of trade may owe much to Mirabeau's <span class="italic">Friend of Man</span> (1756). However, it is sometimes forgotten that the analysis applied not just to particular economies but equally to regions and indeed to particular industries. The policy position which emerges is nothing if not complex and is readily open to misinterpretation. It should also be noted that Steuart consistently suggests that economic policies must always be related to specific circumstances and that he did not advocate intervention for its own sake. His general position is aptly summarized in the statement that &#145;the scaffolding must be taken away when the fabric is completed&#146;  (Steuart, <span class="italic">Principles</span>, 1966, lxxvi; 1998, 4.301n.). In the manner of Hume, Sir James was &#145;completely free from the paralysing belief that crept over the intellectual life of Europe, in practical principles that claim universal validity&#146;  (Schumpeter, 292).<h2>
<a name="Pardon"></a>Pardon</h2>Throughout the time that the <span class="italic">Principles</span> had been in preparation, Steuart maintained an anxious correspondence with Baron Mure and Lord Barrington. At one stage in 1764 he reminded Mure that &#145;time runs away&#146;, indicating that on the advice of Barrington he was to postpone a visit to London on the grounds that it was unlikely to be useful.<br>
<br>The task of securing Steuart's status proved to be unexpectedly difficult. The earl of Buchan spent much of the summer of 1766 trying to interest William Pitt in the case, and towards the end of the year it seemed that progress was being made. On 11 December Barrington was able to inform Sir James that the duchess of Hamilton had persuaded General Conway to present a petition, and that the lord chief justice was favourably disposed. The application, signed by Conway, was drawn up by 1 January 1767. The request for pardon was duly referred to Thomas Miller, the lord justice clerk, who produced a report dated 19 February 1767. Miller may not have been truly convinced by Steuart's case, and in recommending clemency placed more emphasis on the fact that there had been a &#145;happy change in the sentiments &hellip; of those who had so long remained disaffected to your Royal House&#146;. In the circumstances Steuart may have been regarded as harmless, and it is interesting to note that Miller should have concluded that the facts of Steuart's association with the Jacobite cause &#145;remain true&#146;.<br>
<br>Steuart's case, quite understandably, was officially viewed with extreme caution. The formalities were completed only in December 1771 when the attorney-general, given the opinion of the lord justice clerk, recommended a pardon rather than a <i>noli prosequi</i> as &#145;the clearest and fullest indemnity to Sir James Steuart&#146;. Steuart was presented at court on 20 March 1772 by his &#145;never failing friend, Lord Barrington&#146;. On this occasion George III enquired of Barrington why Sir James had departed from the political opinions of his ancestors. Barrington replied:<blockquote>from Sir James's information, that such had been the personal civilities which he had received from Charles Stuart at Rome, he thought himself obliged to return them at Edinburgh. The king said, <i>he did not like him the worse for his motive</i>. (Steuart, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.380)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Advicetogovernment"></a>Advice to government</h2>Following his pardon it is possible that Steuart hoped to embark on a new career: that of government adviser. During a visit to London in 1772 this ambition was partially fulfilled. Lord Barrington brought Steuart's name to the attention of the East India Company, as a result of which Steuart was invited to comment upon the currency problems in Bengal. He stayed in London for the three months (May to July) it needed to prepare the report, which falls into three parts: on coinage, the causes of the scarcity of coin, and methods for expanding paper credit. The essay was published in 1772 as the <span class="italic">Principles of Money Applied to the State of the Coin in Bengal</span>.<br>
<br>After a further visit to Lord Barrington, Steuart arrived back at Coltness late in September. He wrote to thank the East India directors for a diamond ring, but soon turned his attention elsewhere. He was approached for advice on the proposed reform of the British coinage, and later completed an additional chapter for the <span class="italic">Principles of Political Oeconomy</span>, &#145;The state of the British coin in 1773&#146;. By December he had drafted a brief treatment of the <span class="italic">State of the Revenue of Scotland</span>. It was in this year that Sir James changed his name to Steuart Denham as a condition of a bequest from a relative, Archibald Denham.<br>
<br>In 1775 Steuart Denham wrote his <span class="italic">Observations</span> on a new bill designed to alter the electoral qualifications for freeholders and completed a <span class="italic">Plan for Introducing the Uniformity of Weights and Measures</span>. The beginning of 1776 found him writing to Paris to secure copies of the <span class="italic">Encyclop&eacute;die</span> and Turgot's <span class="italic">Edicts</span>. This was also the year of the publication of Adam Smith's <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</span>. Steuart Denham must have heard of its coming appearance from Hume and, as an established authority, must have been awaiting the event with interest. However, Sir James can have derived scant pleasure from the <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span>, which did not accord him, then one of the most prolific economists of the time, so much as a mention. Smith's decision was deliberate, but difficult to assess. In a letter to William Pulteney dated 3 September 1772 he noted that &#145;without once mentioning the book [<span class="italic">Principles</span>], I flatter myself that every false principle in it, will meet with a clear and distinct confutation in mine&#146;. On the other hand, Smith's biographer John Rae recorded contemporary evidence which suggested that Smith understood Sir James's system better from his conversation than from his volumes  (Rae, 61).<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>After 1777 Steuart Denham began to turn away from political economy to the study of philosophy and theology. In 1778 he suffered a serious illness. Even so, in the following year, he wrote his <span class="italic">Critical Remarks</span> on Mirabaud's <span class="italic">System of Nature</span>, and followed this with the essay <span class="italic">The Motive for Obedience to the Laws of God</span>. Sir James also found time to write an article on the distillery industry, which was published in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span> on 4 October 1779. But ill health had taken its toll. Before the winter was over he was suffering from a giddiness in the head as well as gout. Under the care of Sir Stuart Thriepland of Fingask, an old friend, relative, and fellow Jacobite, he made a partial recovery, sufficient at least to allow a short summer tour in 1780. During September and most of October Sir James was free of illness. He recovered much of his old energy and, during these months, maintained an active correspondence with Sir George Colebrook's daughter, who was then contemplating residence abroad. Steuart Denham also completed a long account of French finances and sources of revenue for Sir George Colebrook. But once he had finished this task, he was obliged to travel to Edinburgh for medical attention. It was here, according to the <span class="italic">Annual Review</span>, that Steuart Denham died at 2 p.m. on 26 November 1780. He was interred in the family vault at Cambusnethan, near Wishaw in the county of Lanark. The vault is now a ruin.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Steuart's <span class="italic">Collected Works</span> (published in 1805) was prepared by George Chalmers, with the assistance of Sir James's son, now General Sir James Steuart, who also erected a monument to his father's memory in Westminster Abbey. In Britain this edition did much to confirm Steuart Denham's reputation as Eurocentric in perspective and as an advocate of strong government in economic affairs. Early reviewers, while quick to praise the scholarship of this &#145;philosophical genius&#146;, were almost universally adverse to Steuart's interventionism. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> had gone so far as to accuse him of imbibing &#145;<i>prejudices abroad no means consistent with the present state of</i> <i>England</i><i>, and the genius of Englishmen</i>&#146;. Sir James replied with some asperity: &#145;Can it be supposed that during an absence of near twenty years, I should in my studies, have all the while been modelling my speculations upon the standard of English notions?&#146;  (Steuart, <span class="italic">Principles</span>, 1966, 1.4; 1998, 1.5). Later he recognized the importance of the point as it applied to an English audience. In a note to the corrected copy he wrote: &#145;I frankly acknowledge that I have, perhaps, on some occasions, been more apt to consider myself in the light of a political matron, than that of a jovial and free born Englishman&#146;  (Steuart, <span class="italic">Principles</span>, 1998, 4.301n.).<br>
<br>By contrast, as in the immediate aftermath of its publication, the later influence of Steuart's greatest work, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy</span>, proved to be most considerable on the continent. During the 1770s the text was translated into German (twice), and into French in 1789. One authority has noted that &#145;until the final decade of the eighteenth century, Sir James Steuart's <span class="italic">Inquiry</span> was better known and more frequently cited than Smith's <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span>&#146;  (Tribe, 133). The admiration of the members of the nineteenth-century German historical school is now well known. Steuart's historical and cosmopolitan perspective later attracted the well-documented attention of Marx, while it is known that Hegel spent some three months studying one of the German editions. But perhaps the most intriguing link is with North America. The Dublin edition of the <span class="italic">Inquiry</span> (1770) was widely circulated in the colonies. The book also attracted the attention of Alexander Hamilton, whose protectionist position was adopted with a view to counterbalancing the competitive advantages of the British economy in the years following the treaty of Paris (1783). Ironically, Steuart Denham had written, in the late 1770s, a series of letters on the American question in which he argued in favour of economic sanctions rather than military force. But in the last analysis he (like Smith) supported freedom of trade with the colonies irrespective of the political outcome.<br>
