<span class="headword">Booth <span class="st"> [Bothe]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1464), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was possibly born in Eccles, Lancashire, a younger son of Sir John Booth of Barton-on-Irwell and his wife, Joan, daughter of Sir Henry Trafford. Details of his birth date and early education are lacking. His was a large and close family; especially his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2888/', "Laurence Booth")</script>, followed closely in his wake&#151;he too occupied the archbishopric and was buried in the same church&#151;and both helped their nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95145/', "John Booth")</script> considerably in his career towards the bishopric of Exeter, which he held from 1465 to 1478. William Booth studied common law at Gray's Inn, the only fifteenth-century bishop to do so. In 1416 he was admitted to the prebend of Oxton and Cropwell in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, and perhaps already had the rectory of Wilmslow, Cheshire, which he resigned in July 1418. He secured the prebend of Dunham and Newport in Lincoln Cathedral on 10 October 1420. Shortly afterwards he began a long association with the London diocese as canon residentiary and prebendary of Consumpta-per-Mare in St Paul's from 28 May 1421, and archdeacon of Middlesex, from May 1429 to about November 1441, besides other local parish preferment. With a papal dispensation for plurality he collected useful supplementary preferment around the country. At St Paul's he found the chapter's estate administration in disarray; by 1447 he held almost every manor himself and even procured life leases on his promotion to bishop, an abuse that it took the chapter five years to undo. He had profited energetically from his tenure but had at least restored the manors&#151;and indeed the chapter's economy as a whole&#151;to stability and financial health.<br>
<br>In the early 1440s Booth attracted the patronage of William de la Pole, earl (later duke) of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1450), the emerging power at the king's side. In 1445 he was made chancellor to the newly arrived Margaret of Anjou. When the see of Coventry and Lichfield fell vacant in March 1447, both king and queen wrote to Pope Nicholas V (<i>r</i>. 1447&#150;55) to recommend Booth; he was duly provided on 26 April and consecrated in St Paul's on 9 July. He continued to serve Margaret as chancellor, most notably in her foundation of Queen's (later Queens') College, Cambridge. He was, as a result, often absent from his diocese, but his register shows him as an efficient administrator with able deputies.<br>
<br>In May 1450 Suffolk, impeached and widely hated, was murdered on his way into exile. Booth, like others, was tainted by association, his reputation smeared in satirical verses, and even his life threatened during Cade's revolt in May&#150;July 1450. In November the parliamentary Commons demanded his expulsion from the king's court, along with some thirty others. Like these, Booth was not sacrificed by the crown; although no longer her chancellor (Laurence Booth now held the post), he was supported by the queen and by Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1455), the new power at court. On 21 July 1452 he was even translated to the archbishopric of York, such was the government's recovery of confidence, though he was not formally enthroned until 4 September 1453. Thomas Gascoigne (<i>d</i>. 1458), the vitriolic theologian and commentator&#151;and himself a Yorkshireman&#151;condemned such a promotion as a grave disservice to God, but he often made such statements. In fact Booth seems to have been effective enough, if along conventional lines rather than by the preaching missions that the high-minded Gascoigne demanded (and, to be fair, practised). His York register shows that he was resident for two-thirds of the time, and otherwise attended on the affairs of the realm only as his status demanded. He chose able staff; three successive archdeacons of Richmond went on to become bishops themselves.<br>
<br>From the summer of 1453 national affairs became permanently and dangerously factional, not least around York where the Nevilles and Percys took to violence. Booth, his fingers already singed by events in 1450&#150;51, took care to steer a prudent path; in spring 1454 he was at Westminster when there was rebellion in Yorkshire against Richard of York's protectorate, and again in the autumn when the two local magnate families clashed once more; on 22 May 1455 he was in his diocese when York attacked and killed his enemies around the king at St Albans. Despite old loyalties he seems to have been cautious about joining Queen Margaret in her uncompromising revival of the Lancastrian regime in the following years. A week before she defeated and killed York and the earl of Salisbury at Wakefield on 30 December 1460 Booth was further south, at Southwell in Nottinghamshire; afterwards he still did not join her, and was indeed in London among her opponents, if not actively of them, by 27 January 1461, evidently not participating in her own invasion south to rescue her husband. There he remained until the final swing of the pendulum ended in Edward IV's victory at Towton in Yorkshire on 29 March.<br>
<br>Booth returned to his diocese in late April and ordered his clergy to help prepare the defence against a Scottish invasion on Henry VI's behalf. On 28 June he joined Archbishop Thomas Bourchier of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1486) in crowning Edward IV in Westminster Abbey, and in November participated fully in the king's first parliament. Over the next three years he was included in many royal commissions in his province and twice, in 1462 and 1463, prepared his clergy once more against invasion. He attended parliament at Westminster in April&#150;June 1463, then twice acted on the king's behalf to prorogue intended sessions at York, in February and May 1464, as intended major campaigns by the king against Lancastrian resistance in the north and Scotland came to nothing. On 10 August 1464 Booth received an exemption for life from attendance at councils or parliaments because of his age and frailty.<br>
<br>Booth made his will on 26 August 1464 at his favourite residence, Southwell. It was not complicated. He and all the Booth family had established a notable collective chantry to St Katherine in Eccles church in 1450, and another there to Jesus and St Mary the Virgin (the patron saint) in 1460. Now the archbishop made further financial bequests to both and provided for a house to be built for the chantry priests. He left his pastoral staff and mitre to York Minster but little else. He died at Southwell on 12 September 1464 and was buried there, as he requested, in the chapel of St John the Baptist in the collegiate church. No trace now remains of a tomb. All his life he was a quietly efficient and talented administrator, for a while notorious and abused only because his patrons were; but he was not a factious politician and, even in the heat of civil war, this came finally to be recognized.<br>
