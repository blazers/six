<span class="headword">Reckitt, Sir  James</span>, first baronet  (1833&#150;1924), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 14 November 1833 in Nottingham, the sixth of seven children of Isaac Reckitt (1792&#150;1862), miller and corn factor, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1874), daughter of Charles and Elizabeth Coleby of Hempstead, Norfolk. His formal education was at Packer's academy in Nottingham and the Society of Friends' Ackworth School, near Pontefract. In 1848 he joined his father's starch and blue business, which had been acquired in 1840, as a travelling salesman. After Isaac's death in 1862 James and two of his brothers carried on their father's business as a partnership. On 12 October 1865 he married Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of Robert Saunders, agent; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Between 1879, when the business was incorporated as Reckitt &amp; Sons Ltd, and 1917, Reckitt and his elder brother, Francis, were alternate chairmen; James was sole chairman between 1917 and 1924. Through innovative marketing, which included branding and heavy advertising, the production and sale of starch, blue, and boot and metal polish proved an international success. In 1888 the business became a private joint-stock company, and in 1899 it was reconstructed to form a new public company. Its capitalization was then &pound;1.7 million, though it was still owned mainly by the family. By 1914 it had become a multinational manufacturing company employing more than 5000 people.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Reckitt entered into negotiations with J. and J. Colman of Norwich, a competitor in the starch and blue trades. With a view to diversification, he proposed that Reckitt and Colman should become joint buyers of Keen Robinson, a successful mustard, spice, and cereal foods manufacturer, but support from the Colmans was not forthcoming. None the less, perceived common interests in limiting competition brought Reckitt and Colman together in 1913, when the two companies combined to form a joint exports committee, the first of several. This policy culminated, in 1938, in the formation of Reckitt and Colman Ltd, representing a merger of the trading interests of the two companies; Philip Reckitt, Sir James's younger son, was the first chairman.<br>
<br>Sir James and Philip were active in the provision of welfare and environmental improvements affecting employees and others. In 1905&#150;6 the company appointed full-time welfare workers for female and male employees; medical services for all Reckitt workers were introduced in 1907. A day continuation school for girls was established in 1910, and for boys in 1919. A non-contributory pension fund was set up in 1890. A major investment in the garden village, a private freehold estate consisting of 600 dwellings, was undertaken by a development company, The Garden Village (Hull) Ltd, set up by Reckitt and his fellow directors; two-thirds of the &pound;150,000 capital was provided by the company, while during his lifetime Reckitt waived &pound;50,000 in dividends to benefit the village. His objective was to create an environment within easy reach of the factory yet comprising high-quality houses at low rentals, with gardens and services. A recreation ground and hall were added after the village opened in 1907.<br>
<br>In the wider community Reckitt was elected to Hull's first school board in 1870, was a supporter and benefactor of the Newland Homes for seamen's orphans, and established the James Reckitt Home for girls, opened in 1905. As a member of the board of management of Hull Infirmary, chairman of the finance and house committees, and chairman of the management board in 1900, he secured a charter of incorporation, led a successful appeal to build a major extension to the hospital, and financed the building of the Withernsea Consumptive Sanatorium and an annexe for the Hull Nursing Association. In 1891 he built and endowed a library for public use in order to prove that it could be financed on a penny rate. His last major philanthropic enterprise was the setting up of the Sir James Reckitt Trust devoted to those charitable purposes approved of by Quakers and to the benefit mainly of the local population.<br>
<br>Reckitt was created a baronet in 1894 in recognition, in part, of public service but also in acknowledgement of Reckitt's political role in the East Riding. He was a county councillor, deputy lieutenant and JP, and from 1873 an effective chairman of the Hull Liberal Party. He received the freedom of Hull in 1908. He died at his home, Swanland Manor, Swanland, near Hull, on 18 March 1924; his estate was valued at &pound;487,152.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51485"></a><span class="headword">Sir Philip Bealby Reckitt</span>, third baronet  (1873&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Hessle, near Hull, on 1 January 1873, the second son of James Reckitt. He was educated at Oliver's Mount School, Scarborough, and King's College, Cambridge, where he read natural sciences. He joined Reckitts in 1898, became a director in 1904, and as chairman of the company's works council assumed responsibility for welfare policy. On 19 April 1900 he married Hilda, daughter of Frederick Brent Grotrian. She died in 1935. Despite ill health he became company chairman in 1930 and was chairman of Reckitt and Colman Ltd from 1938 until his death in 1944. He was a JP for the North and East Ridings, and also the first chairman of the City of Hull Conservative Association. For twenty years he was president of the Hull Institute for the Blind and of the Deaf and Dumb Institute. As treasurer of the Royal Infirmary between 1911 and 1932 he was instrumental in financing expansion. His donations to local institutions also included the new Hull University College, founded in 1928 by Thomas Ferens, then chairman of Reckitt &amp; Sons Ltd. In 1918 Reckitt was appointed OBE for his services as commandant of the military hospital set up in the firm's social hall. He succeeded his brother, Harold, as baronet in 1930. On 28 April 1939 he married Margarida Elizabeth Bishop (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Barrington), a widow. Shortly before his death an endowment of &pound;20,000 launched the Philip Reckitt Educational Trust for the purpose of encouraging employees to travel and study abroad. He died at his home, Little Green, Compton, near Chichester, on 17 November 1944.<br>
