<span class="headword">Vining family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1807&#150;1915), <span class="occ">actors</span>, flourished in London during the nineteenth century. The common ancestors were Charles Vining, a silversmith in Kirby Street, Hatton Garden, and his wife, Mary. They had eight children, all of whom were connected with the theatre. The Miss E. Vining (<i>fl</i>. 1798&#150;1806) who appears in the records at Drury Lane as a dancer and singer was probably one of them. <a name="cosubject_28323"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Vining</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1790, <em>d.</em> 1871)<span class="occ"></span>, a son, appeared as Young Norval at Gravesend in 1807, afterwards remaining on the Gravesend, Worthing, Hythe, and Brighton circuit. In 1809 he played Durimel in <span class="italic">The Point of Honour</span> at Bath, and subsequently played at Norwich. On 17 September 1813 he made his London d&eacute;but at Covent Garden as Frederick in <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>; other parts there included Harry Dornton in <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, and the original Count Frederick Friberg in <span class="italic">The Miller and his Men</span>. On 2 March 1814 he married Marian Jemima Bew, an actress, who died from breast cancer on 17 June 1853 at the age of sixty-one. A daughter, Marian, was baptized in Ipswich in 1817. In 1821 Frederick Vining was back in Bath, where, among other roles, he was the first Tressilian in <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span>. In 1823 he opened at the Haymarket as Young Rapid in <span class="italic">A Cure for the Heartache</span>, and went on to play many more characters in comedy at that theatre, at which he was also stage manager for a short time. He died at Camberwell House Lunatic Asylum, Camberwell, on 2 June 1871.<br>
<br>There appear to have been two actresses called Fanny Vining. <a name="cosubject_75127"></a><span class="headword">Fanny Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Fanny Ellen]</span> Vining</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1869)<span class="occ"></span> was Frederick's daughter, and married Charles Gill (1796/7&#150;1869), actor and theatre manager, on 5 July 1843; they had a daughter, Ellen Marian Eva Gill, baptized in Colchester in 1845. This Miss Vining acted with Charles Kean and William Macready, and with Mrs Warner at the Marylebone Theatre. She apparently died in the same year as her husband, 1869. Another <a name="cosubject_75126"></a><span class="headword">Fanny Elizabeth Vining</span>  (1829&#150;1891?)<span class="occ"></span> was born in London on 17 July 1829, the daughter of Charles Frederick Vining and a Miss Johnstone. It seems unlikely that this is the same Fanny Vining, for she would not have been fourteen years old on her marriage to Gill, and the marriage certificate declares them both to be of full age. It seems probable that this is the Fanny Vining (whose relationship to the other Vinings is not clear) who married Edward (or Edgar) Loomis Davenport (1816&#150;1877), an American actor, in January 1849, and died in 1891. It is likely that the Miss Fanny Vining who appeared with Alfred Wigan's company at the Olympic in 1849 in a production of <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span> was the one who married Davenport, whom she accompanied to New York, and appeared with him in leading roles until his death. They had nine children, six of whom had careers on the stage, principally in the United States, most successfully Fanny Lily Gipsy Davenport (1850&#150;1898), who had her own company, and Harry George Bryant Davenport (1866&#150;1949), who, in 1912, became one of the first movie actors. Fanny Elizabeth Vining's sister, Adele (<i>d</i>. 1893), married Charles Steyne, and was the mother of E. T. Steyne (<i>d</i>. 1912), the manager and producer.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28325"></a><span class="headword">James Vining</span>  (1795&#150;1870)<span class="occ"></span> was another son of Charles and Mary Vining. He first appeared on the London stage at Covent Garden on 3 October 1828 as Tybalt in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>. He also played the prince of Wales in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>, Raymond in <span class="italic">Raymond and Agnes</span>, and appeared with Madame Vestris at the Olympic in 1831. Most appreciated in the parts of lovers and fops, he gave his last performance at the Lyceum on 30 January 1860 as Dr Manette in Tom Taylor's adaptation of <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span>. The success of his career may be gauged by the proving of his will at under &pound;6000 in 1870, following his death on 27 June that year at his home, 25 St John's Park, Upper Holloway, London. He left a widow, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnes (1801/2&#150;1876), whom he had married on 27 May 1823, and at least one son, <a name="cosubject_28324"></a><span class="headword">George James Vining</span>  (1824&#150;1875)<span class="occ"></span>, who also enjoyed a successful career on the stage. George James was educated at St Peter's Grammar School in Eaton Square, London, and subsequently in France, and spent six years working in a bank before making his professional theatrical d&eacute;but in Newmarket on 4 December 1845 as Hamlet. In Jersey he met Macready (in whose company James Vining had been) and played with him in Bath and Bristol. He then joined Mary Amelia Warner for her opening season at the Marylebone Theatre, making his London d&eacute;but there as Florizel in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (20 August 1847). On 31 August 1850 he married Sarah Mary Vertigan Stubbs (<i>b</i>. in or before 1828/9). In 1853 he was with Alfred Wigan at the Olympic, where he was the first Captain Hawksley in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Still Waters Run Deep</span>. In 1856 he created the part of Frank Lauriston in <span class="italic">Stay at Home</span>, an adaptation by Slingsby Lawrence of <span class="italic">Un mari qui se d&eacute;range</span>, and in 1857 created the part of Charles in <span class="italic">Daddy Hardacre</span>, an adaptation of <span class="italic">La fille de l'avare</span>. When the Olympic management of Robson and Emden opened in August 1857 he spoke a prologue, and remained at that theatre for some years, creating numerous roles in farces and comedies, especially those of Tom Taylor and John Oxenford. He was initially stage manager for the winter season of 1861&#150;2 at the St James's Theatre, but when Alfred Wigan withdrew as manager Vining took over. In January 1862 he appeared there as the hero in <span class="italic">Self-Made</span>, his own adaptation of <span class="italic">Le chevalier de St Georges</span>. His management ended in September, when he joined Charles Fechter's company at the Lyceum. Vining's most popular creation was Badger the detective in Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">The Streets of London</span>, which he first played on 1 August 1864 at the Princess's Theatre. He had taken on the lease of the Princess's in 1863, and continued to act there until he went bankrupt in November 1869, being discharged the following February. He was very successful in portraying Count Fosco in Wilkie Collins's <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span> at the Olympic in October 1871. A good actor of the second rank, George Vining died at the Great Western Hotel, Reading, on 17 December 1875.<br>
<br>The <a name="cosubject_75128"></a><span class="headword">William Vining</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1783, <em>d.</em> 1861)<span class="occ"></span> who made his first appearance at Drury Lane in 1819 was the eldest brother of Frederick and James Vining and was baptized on 20 October 1783 at St Bartholomew-the-Great, West Smithfield. His wife, <a name="cosubject_75129"></a><span class="headword">Mary Gossop Vining</span>  (1795/6&#150;1868)<span class="occ"></span>, made her stage reputation playing the first Amy Robsart in <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span> at Covent Garden on 8 March 1821, and, four days later, Lady Anne to Macready's Richard III. She had enjoyed considerable popularity at Bath in 1813&#150;14, and was later to be celebrated for her portrayals of Meg Merrilies and Helen Macgregor. She died on 20 January 1868 aged seventy-two. It is not clear whether before her marriage she was the Miss Johannet or Johannot who first appeared as a theatrical dancer. William Vining died at their home, 77 Arlington Street, Camden Town, London, on 21 November 1861. Henry Vining (<i>bap</i>. 1789) was another of the Vining brothers; his wife, Amelia Quantrell (1803/4&#150;1874), whom he married in 1828, was also an actress and survived him. Their daughter, Matilda Charlotte (<i>bap</i>. 1831, <i>d</i>. 1915), enjoyed a long and successful career in the theatre under the name Mrs John Wood [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51461/', "Wood, Matilda Charlotte")</script>]. Matilda's daughter and granddaughter, Florence Wood and Molly Lumley, also had theatrical careers which brought the dynasty into the twentieth century. Other Vinings who appeared on the Victorian stage included Arthur (<i>d</i>. 1895) and his wife, Rosa Bella (<i>d</i>. 1876), who performed in the music-halls.<br>
