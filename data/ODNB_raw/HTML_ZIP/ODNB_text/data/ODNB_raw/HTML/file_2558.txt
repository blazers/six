<span class="headword">Blagrave,  Joseph</span>  (<em>b. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> in or before 1682), <span class="occ">astrologer</span>, was born in the parish of St Giles, Reading, the youngest of four sons of Alexander Blagrave (<i>d</i>. 1639) and his wife, Margaret. He was a nephew of John Blagrave (<i>d</i>. 1611), the mathematician, from whom he appears to have inherited a small estate in nearby Swallowfield. What little is known of his personal history is mainly derived from his books. His youth was spent in the study of astronomy and astrology, his later years in philosophy and the practice of physic, on which he wrote:<blockquote>Without some knowledge in astronomy one can be no astrologer, and without knowledge in astrology one can be no philosopher, and without knowledge both in astrology and philosophy one can be no good physician, the practice of which must be laid upon the five substantial pillars of time, virtue, number, sympathy, and antipathy. (Blagrave, <span class="italic">Astrological Practice</span>, preface)</blockquote>Blagrave's marriage to his wife, Susan, brought him a son, Joseph, in May 1640, but his wife died shortly after the birth, on 2 June.<br>
<br>Blagrave's first appearance as an author was with a series, <span class="roman">Ephemerides, with Rules for Husbandry for the years 1658, 1659, 1660, and 1665</span>. No copy of the <span class="roman">Ephemeris</span> for 1658 has survived, and the volume for 1660 states that &#145;it came into but few hands, by reason of the slackness of the printer before it came forth&#146;. Copies for the years 1659 and 1660 are rare. The next work ascribed to Blagrave is <span class="italic">The Epitome of the Art of Husbandry, by J. B., Gent.</span> (1669). The attribution to Blagrave is likely, since its editor was his nephew, Obadiah Blagrave, a bookseller in St Paul's Churchyard. He published this and all the subsequent works of his uncle, two of which were posthumous. Blagrave's <span class="italic">Astrological Practice of Physick</span> (1671) certainly appeared in Trinity term for this year, although most copies bear the date 1689, being reprints published in Hilary term 1689/90. His next work was the <span class="italic">Supplement or enlargement to Mr. Nich. Culpepper's English physitian, to which is annexed a new tract for the cure of wounds by gunshot</span> (1674). The preface to this work is dated &#145;From my house called Copt Hall, upon the seven bridges in Reading&#146;. Blagrave's last definite, and posthumously published, work is his <span class="italic">Introduction to Astrology</span>, in three parts (1682). This work contains an engraved portrait of Blagrave at the age of seventy-two and is dedicated to his friend Elias Ashmole the antiquary. Lowndes  (W. T. Lowndes, <span class="italic">Bibliographer's Manual</span>, ed. Bohn, 1, 1864, 214) ascribes to Joseph Blagrave <span class="italic">Planispherium Catholicum</span>, but this is certainly an error, for the work is a revised version of the <span class="italic">Mathematical Jewel</span> of John Blagrave, edited by J. Palmer, and published in London in 1658. Another work wrongly ascribed to Blagrave is a manuscript, now lost, &#145;A remonstrance in favour of antient learning against the proud pretensions of the moderns, more especially in respect to the doctrine of the stars&#146;, about 1669 or 1670.<br>
<br>Blagrave's character appears to have been a mixture of earnest piety with a profound belief in the virtues of astrology. One of the cures which he claimed to have effected was that of casting out a dumb devil from a maid at Basingstoke, where, he reported, after he had invoked the name of the Tetragrammaton with that of the blessed Trinity, &#145;the devil came forth, but invisible, with a great cry and hideous noise, raising a sudden gust of wind, and so vanished&#146;  (Blagrave, <span class="italic">Astrological Practice</span>, 124). The whole story is a curious study in the demonology of the seventeenth century. Blagrave's chief interest lies in his ambiguous status as a leading representative of the long tradition of astrological medicine, at just the time when that tradition was rapidly becoming unacceptable among people of the increasingly powerful &#145;respectable&#146; sort. In this respect, his complaint in the <span class="italic">Astrological Practice of Physick</span> speaks for a generation:<blockquote>I find that many being unsatisfied concerning the legality of my way of Cure, have refused to come or send unto me for help to cure their infirmities: and many of those who did come, came for the most part privately, fearing either loss of reputation or reproaches from their Neighbours, and other unsatisfied people; and also fearing that what I did, was either Diabolical, or by unlawful means. (ibid., preface)</blockquote>Blagrave had died before publication of <span class="italic">Introduction to Astrology</span> in 1682, but the exact date and location of his death are unknown.<br>
