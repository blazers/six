<span class="headword">Ash,  John</span>  (1724&#150;1779), <span class="occ">lexicographer and grammarian</span>, was born in Stockland, Dorset; the details of his parents are unknown. At first a blacksmith's apprentice, he received encouragement from the minister of Loughwood, near Lyme, in whose parish he had been baptized, and from 1740 he studied for the Baptist ministry under Bernard Foskett at Bristol Baptist Academy. Ash evidently served at Loughwood, but most of his adult life was spent at Pershore in Worcestershire, where, having been chosen in 1746, he was ordained as minister in June 1751. He married Elizabeth Goddard that year, and they had six children. The combination of Ash's talent and connections helped the family to prosper, and considerable real estate was acquired. Contacts in the south-west were maintained, and in 1771 he delivered a funeral oration at Bristol for Sarah, only daughter of Joseph Jeffries of Taunton, Somerset; he had baptized her at Pershore in 1760.<br>
<br>Ash's popular grammar, <span class="italic">Grammatical Institutes</span>, was written &#145;to oblige a few of the Author's friends who were engaged in the education of youth&#146; and was first published in 1762  (<span class="italic">Grammatical Institutes</span>, 1762, sig. A4<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). His former friend and fellow minister John Ryland stated in the 1768 edition that it had been written for Ash's five-year-old daughter and that he, Ryland, had used it in his own school for six years. In 1763 the subtitle was opportunistically changed to &#145;An easy introduction to Dr Lowth's English grammar&#146;  (title-page). <span class="italic">Grammatical Institutes</span> became the first grammar produced in England to be published in America, and was also twice translated into German.<br>
<br>Ash's dictionary, <span class="italic">A New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language</span> (2 vols., 1775), was an attempt to include the best features of various earlier dictionaries but is, unfortunately, best-known for the blunder under &#145;curmudgeon&#146;, which Johnson had derived from <i>c&#339;ur m&eacute;chant</i>, on the authority of an &#145;unknown correspondent&#146;. Ash gives it as &#145;from the French <i>c&#339;ur</i> unknown, <i>m&eacute;chant</i> correspondent&#146;  (sig. 2E3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Ash gained his LLD degree from a Scottish university in 1774. In 1777 he published an anthology of educational texts as <span class="italic">Sentiments on Education</span>. He died at Pershore on 10 April 1779, at the age of fifty-five, having developed diabetes; he was buried at Pershore Baptist Church, probably on 13 April. He was survived by his wife.<br>
