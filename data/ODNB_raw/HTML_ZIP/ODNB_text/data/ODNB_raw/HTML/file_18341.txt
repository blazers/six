<span class="headword">Maton,  William George</span>  (1774&#150;1835), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Salisbury on 31 January 1774, the eldest son of George Maton (<i>d</i>. 1816), a wine merchant in that city, and his wife, Mary. He was educated at Salisbury's free grammar school (where he showed an early interest in natural history) and entered Queen's College, Oxford, in July 1790. At Oxford he gave much time to botany, and acquired the friendship of the subject's then professor, John Sibthorp (1758&#150;1796). Maton graduated BA in 1794 and was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in the same year. Although originally intended by his father for the church, Maton continued his academic studies. He graduated MA in January 1797, and began medical studies at Westminster Hospital in the spring of that year. He gained his MB (Oxford) in 1798 and his MD in 1801, and was elected FRS in 1800. Elected a fellow of the College of Surgeons in 1802, he was Goulstonian lecturer in 1803, censor (1804, 1813, and 1824), treasurer (1814&#150;20), and Harveian orator (1815). He was physician to the Westminster Hospital in 1800&#150;08.<br>
<br>While at university Maton published several antiquarian works. He wrote parts of the <span class="italic">Salisbury Guide</span>, and Hutchins's <span class="italic">History of Dorset</span>, as well as a paper on Stonehenge in the <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> for 1794. Travels in Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset led to his <span class="italic">Observations relative chiefly to the natural history, picturesque scenery, and antiquities of the western counties of England, made chiefly in the years 1794 and 1796</span> (2 vols., 1797). In it he concluded that the Cornish language was extinct&#151;a conclusion based on his inability to find a single person who could speak it. The second volume is also notable for its &#145;mineralogical map of the western counties of England&#146;, which has been identified as the &#145;first attempt in England to construct a geological map&#146;  (Paris, 32).<br>
<br>After several years of practising medicine in London, Maton took to residing at Weymouth during &#145;the season&#146;. There he found time to pursue his botanical interests and was often seen rambling in the neighbourhood. Indeed, he was identified to the royal family (spending the season at Gloucester Lodge) as the person to name a specimen of <i>Arundo</i> (later <i>Calamagrostis</i>) <i>epigejos</i>, which one of the botanically minded princesses had obtained. As a result, he acquired the confidence of the royal family, and in 1816 was appointed physician-extraordinary to Queen Charlotte. In 1820 he attended the duke of Kent in his last illness, and afterwards became physician-in-ordinary to the duchess and to the infant Princess Victoria. His practice increased and between 1823 and 1835 &#145;shared with Sir Henry Halford the best business of the town&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>).<br>
<br>In 1816 Maton's father had died, deeply in debt. By 1827 Maton had paid off in excess of &pound;20,000. The mayor and corporation of Salisbury, in testimony of his honourable conduct, gave him the freedom of the city in a gold box. He bought a country seat near Downton, Wiltshire, but six months later became very ill and died on 30 March 1835 at his house in Spring Gardens, London. In addition to his antiquarian works, Maton published several papers in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span> (of which he served as vice-president) and of the College of Physicians. A woodpecker, a shellfish, and a genus of plants were all named after him.<br>
