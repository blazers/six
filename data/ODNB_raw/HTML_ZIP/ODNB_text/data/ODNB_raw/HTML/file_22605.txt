<span class="headword">Potter,  Barnaby</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, son of Thomas Potter, mercer and alderman of Kendal, Westmorland, was baptized on 11 August 1577. After schooling at Kendal with Mr Maxwell, &#145;a Puritane&#146;  (Lloyd, 153), on 3 May 1594 he matriculated at Oxford from the Queen's College. He graduated BA on 24 April 1599, proceeded MA on 30 June 1602, and was elected fellow on 1 March 1604.<br>
<br>For some years Potter lived at Bowden, in Totnes, Devon, in the house of Sir Edward Giles, MP for the town. There he became a preacher &#145;much followed by the precise party&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, iii.22). Early in 1610 he declined the principalship of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Potter proceeded BD on 5 July 1610, but continued to live mostly in Devon. In 1613 he published a funeral sermon, <span class="italic">The Baronets Buriall</span>, with a dedication to Sir Edward and Lady Mary Giles, in which he commented that &#145;the more learned are the more loath to leave any thing in print to the view of the world&#146;. This may explain his failure to publish systematic series of sermons on scripture attributed to him by Lloyd  (Lloyd, 156).<br>
<br>The year 1615 was critical in Potter's life. On 29 May he was presented by James I to the rectory of Diptford, Devon. He proceeded DD on 27 June. On 21 August he married at Dean Prior, Devon, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1673), daughter of Walter Northcote of Crediton, a clothier, and widow of Edward Yard of Churston Ferrers. Sir Edward Giles, connected by marriage with the Yards, had moved to Dean Prior, and on 4 October 1615 he presented Potter to the vicarage there. The Potters had one son, who died in 1623, and six daughters, almost all baptized at Dean Prior between 1616 and 1625, of whom Grace and Amye were celebrated by Robert Herrick, Potter's successor, in his poem &#145;Hesperides&#146;.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1616 Potter was elected provost by the fellows of Queen's, who rejected Archbishop Abbot's recommendation of Dr Pilkington. Over ten years he saw through repairs and material improvements, but kept his family in Devon. He became chaplain to King James and continued in that position initially under Charles I, becoming known as the &#145;Penetential Preacher&#146;  (Lloyd, 154).<br>
<br>Thomas Crosfield of Queen's College remarked in early June 1626 on Potter's influence at court  (Queen's College, MS 390, fol. 18<i>v</i>). It may have been in expectation of preferment as well as for personal reasons that he resigned the headship of Queen's on 17 June 1626, having secured the succession of his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22607/', "Christopher Potter")</script>, chaplain to Lord Keeper Coventry. He was appointed chief almoner to Charles I on 4 July 1628. The king seems to have held Potter, despite his consistent Calvinism, in some regard, although Laud claimed credit at his trial for his appointment as bishop of Carlisle. At Potter's consecration on 15 March 1629, Christopher Potter preached.<br>
<br>The new bishop was financially embarrassed and borrowed &pound;100 from his college. He was reputed the &#145;Puritanical Bishop&#146;, and it was said that &#145;the noise of an Organ would blow him out the Church&#146; despite a personal love of music  (Lloyd, 153). His visitation articles of 1629 were published. Enjoying good relations even with Catholic recusants, he was reputed &#145;indulgent to tender consciences&#146; among protestants  (ibid., 154&#150;5). Reporting on his diocese in January 1636 he blamed churchwardens and justices of the peace for failure to achieve due attendance at services, and dropped a broad hint that he wanted a better diocese. Charles I's marginal comments suggest dissatisfaction with Potter's performance. When his diocese was stricken by plague that year the bishop was in Devon and the king had to insist in August that he return to the north.<br>
<br>Potter was one of the bishops who recommended acceptance of Strafford's attainder to the king in 1641. He died in January 1642 at Covent Garden lodgings and was buried on 6 January in the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent Garden. He was to be held up as an exemplary prelate by Bishop Joseph Hall in 1644.<br>
