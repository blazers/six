<span class="headword">Maitland,  William Fuller</span>  (1813&#150;1876), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born on 10 March 1813, the second, but eldest surviving, son and heir of Ebenezer Fuller Maitland of Stansted, Essex, and Park Place, Henley-on-Thames. He was educated by private tutors until he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1835, and MA in 1839. Although he never trained as an artist, Maitland quickly developed a remarkable love for, and insight into, paintings. During several journeys to Italy he became acquainted with the works of the early Italian masters&#151;yet to acquire their later popularity&#151;and was one of their earliest admirers and collectors. His taste for the Netherlandish and German schools of the fifteenth century was unusual in England, and his collection also included many remarkable works of English landscape. Unlike other collectors of the period, his interest was focused mainly on paintings to the exclusion of <i>objets d'art</i>.<br>
<br>Maitland's first marriage, to Lydia, only daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Serjentson Prescott, took place in Florence in 1842; they had four children. A widower, he married again, in London, on 1 June 1852; his second wife was Charlotte Elizabeth Dick, daughter of James Munro Macnabb; they had one daughter. Maitland lived at Stansted in Essex. His interests were by no means confined to art and connoisseurship, but included literature and a love of sport, dogs, and everything connected with the outdoor life.<br>
<br>For many years Maitland lent paintings to the Royal Academy old masters exhibitions, and most unusually, soon after his death, the Royal Academy passed a vote of condolence to his widow and acknowledged his substantial contribution to the loan exhibitions' success. He died suddenly at Stansted House on 15 February 1876, and was buried at Stansted on 19 February. After Maitland's death the bulk of his collection was exhibited at the South Kensington Museum, and subsequently nine of the most important pictures were sold to the National Gallery, including Fraucicbigro's <span class="italic">Portrait of a Knight of Rhodes</span>, an <span class="italic">Agony in the Garden</span> ascribed to Le Spaque, and a tondo entitled <span class="italic">Virgin and Child with Saint John</span> from the studio of Botticelli. Other works are in York, Berlin, and New York.<br>
