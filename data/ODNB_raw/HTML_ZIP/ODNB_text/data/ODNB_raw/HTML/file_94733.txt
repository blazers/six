<span class="headword">Zwane,  Ambrose Phesheya</span>  (1924&#150;1998), <span class="occ">politician in Swaziland</span>, was born near Bremersdorp, Swaziland, on 30 April 1924, the son of Amos Mdolomba Zwane, a traditional physician who had accompanied the young paramount chief Sobhuza II on a deputation to London in 1923. He was educated at Roman Catholic schools in Swaziland&#151;he was a lifelong Catholic&#151;and at Inkamana high school in Natal. He then studied medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was a contemporary of many South African nationalists, including Nelson Mandela, and became in 1951 the first Swazi to qualify as a medical doctor. After working as a houseman in Natal he returned to Swaziland and worked at the Mbabane government hospital. Frustrated by the lack of prospects for promotion, he resigned in April 1960 and became secretary-general of the newly formed Swaziland Progressive Party in July of that year. This party emerged out of the Swaziland Progressive Association, which had been set up in 1929 with official backing to give a voice to the emerging educated &eacute;lite. It became a political party in preparation for constitutional talks on the future governance of Swaziland that were initiated by the resident commissioner, Brian Marwick, in October 1960.<br>
<br>Zwane and the leader of the party's youth league, Prince Clement Dumisa Dlamini, a nephew of the king and a fiery orator, soon fell out with the leader of the Swaziland Progressive Party, John June Nquku, a Zulu who had come to Swaziland in 1930 as a school inspector and had had a varied career in education and journalism. The split was confirmed when Zwane was elected president of the party at a meeting at Kwaluseni in February 1962. A new manifesto proclaimed that the party sought &#145;a nationalist, democratic, socialist and pan-Africanist state within the fraternity of African states and the British Commonwealth&#146;  (Rake, 352). Nquku refused to recognize the election and two factions of the Swaziland Progressive Party co-existed for some time. Zwane's faction was excluded from the abortive constitutional talks that were held in London in January 1963 and became the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress (NNLC) in April of that year. The NNLC established its radical credentials through its involvement in strikes in June 1963 at the Havelock asbestos mine and the Ubombo ranches, and among workers in the capital, Mbabane, in May&#150;June 1963. Zwane was out of the country, attending the inaugural conference of the Organization of African Unity, when they reached their crisis. He was charged with fomenting public violence but was acquitted in January 1964. His colleagues Prince Dumisa and MacDonald Maseko, a South African refugee of Swazi descent, received short prison sentences.<br>
<br>Following the breakdown of the constitutional talks the British government imposed its own constitution, which came into force in January 1964. This provided for elections to a legislative council by voters on a common roll, a &#145;white&#146; roll, and by &#145;traditional&#146; means. At first Zwane and the NNLC threatened to boycott the elections, but they changed their minds and decided to take part. This prompted Sobhuza and the Swazi national council&#151;a council of chiefs and elders with power over Swazi nation land, law, and custom&#151;to enter the political arena by establishing a king's party, the Imbokodvo National Movement. The NNLC failed to win any common roll seats when the first elections were held in June 1964, the Swazi national council having made it impossible for the NNLC and the smaller nationalist parties to campaign in Swazi nation areas where the majority of the population lived. After the election the British government continued to exclude the NNLC from any part in the negotiations over decolonization, which resulted in the restoration of self-government in Swaziland in April 1967. In the elections of that month, the first to be held with a universal franchise, the NNLC again failed to win seats, though it gained 20 per cent of the vote. The division of the country into eight three-member constituencies had ensured that there was no urban seat. When Zwane and the NNLC were excluded from the final pre-independence talks in London in February 1968 he sought to draw attention to their exclusion by a sit-down protest outside Marlborough House.<br>
<br>In the first post-independence elections, held in 1972, the NNLC won the Mphumalanga constituency. Zwane was, with one of his colleagues, allowed to take his seat, but the third colleague, Thomas Bhekindlela Ngwenya, was deported to South Africa on the grounds that he was not a Swazi. The government then lost a series of legal actions over the immigration status of Ngwenya. When its attempt to circumvent the appeal court by removing immigration cases from its purview was declared illegal in April 1973, Sobhuza declared a state of emergency, and had parliament vote itself out of existence. He also banned all political parties, including his own. Zwane was detained under the sixty-days' detention law on 2 May 1973 and was frequently re-detained in that and subsequent years. After he had been detained three times in 1978 he fled to Mozambique, but he was compelled to move on to Tanzania.<br>
<br>Zwane returned to Swaziland in 1979 with a letter from Sobhuza, countersigned by President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, assuring him that he would not be harassed on his return, provided that he did not take part in public political activity. He worked quietly as a doctor through the 1980s, avoiding involvement in the political crisis that followed the death of Sobhuza in 1982, but he was charged in April 1989 with possession of pamphlets issued by the People's United Democratic Party, an underground party that had been launched in 1983. One of his last political acts was his participation in a committee formed to celebrate the release of Nelson Mandela in February 1990; even that was seen as a threat by the regime of Sobhuza's son and successor, Mswati III. Zwane died in March 1998 after a long illness. His funeral on 28 March was the occasion for a demonstration of support for the NNLC, which was more or less openly revived at that time.<br>
<br>A shy and diffident intellectual, and a poor platform speaker, Zwane was a most unlikely politician, but he was a man of undoubted intelligence, charm, and integrity. Even if he had been a more gifted orator, it is unlikely that he and his party would have made much headway against Sobhuza II, and his successful mobilization of Swazi &#145;traditionalism&#146;. After the departure from Swaziland of Sir Brian Marwick, who had sought to pave the way for a constitutional monarchy, the British authorities offered little resistance to Sobhuza's demand for a less than democratic electoral dispensation, and to his insistence that control of land and minerals should be kept out of the hands of parliament. There was, no doubt, pressure from South Africa on Britain to ensure that even moderate nationalists, such as Zwane, were kept out of power. Zwane's political career was a failure, but he was widely respected for his lonely stand against royal autocracy.<br>
