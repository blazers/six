<span class="headword">M&uuml;nchhausen,  Philipp Adolf  von</span>, Baron M&uuml;nchhausen in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1694&#150;1762), <span class="occ">politician and administrator</span>, was born on 7 July 1694 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> at Steinburg, Saxony, the son of Gerlach Heino von M&uuml;nchhausen (1652&#150;1710) and Katharina Sophie von Selmnitz (1665&#150;1734); his elder brother&#151;the couple's third son&#151;was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95949/', "Gerlach Adolf von M&#252;nchhausen")</script>, politician and diplomat. The estate where Philipp was born had come to the family through his mother, Katharina. She was the heir of Ernst Freidemann von Selmnitz, who had been in Saxon service. Katharina had inherited the properties of Steinburg, near Merseburg, and Straussfurt, near Erfurt. It was to these estates, along with his own property of Wendlinghausen, that Philipp's father had retired in 1689. Ill health had forced him to give up his office as a Brandenburg courtier and master of horse.<br>
<br>M&uuml;nchhausen followed his older brother to the universities of Jena and Halle and almost certainly studied law. He also spent some time on the grand tour before entering the service of Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel in 1717. He was appointed a gentleman of the chamber and counsellor to the duke and remained in Wolfenb&uuml;ttel until 1724. In that year he transferred to the Saxon court in Dresden as a counsellor to the Saxon appeal court. He married Charlotte Louise von Leitzkau (1705&#150;1730) at Leitzkau Castle on 2 July 1724. M&uuml;nchhausen's time in Saxon service was relatively short. In 1725 he moved to become a privy councillor in the bishopric of Osnabr&uuml;ck, which had been the subject of an unusual arrangement at the treaty of Westphalia (1648). It had been agreed that the bishopric would alternate between a Roman Catholic and a protestant, nominated by the ruling dukes of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg. George I's father, Ernest Augustus (Ernst August), had been the first protestant bishop and, following a Catholic interlude when the see had been held by the archbishop-elector of Trier, the title had devolved on George I's brother, another Ernest Augustus, in 1715. M&uuml;nchhausen had, in effect, entered Hanoverian service and he was to remain in it for the rest of his career. Following Ernest Augustus's death in 1728 and the reversion of Osnabr&uuml;ck to Catholic rule, M&uuml;nchhausen began to work directly for the ministry of the electorate of Hanover. He became president of the authorities in Stade, a town in the north of the electorate, close to the Elbe, in 1730.<br>
<br>M&uuml;nchhausen's first wife died in 1730. The marriage had produced three children, two daughters and a son. Both Sophie Dorothea (1725&#150;1787) and Wilhelmine Christiane (1728&#150;1769) were able to marry well within the Hanoverian nobility. Friedrich Otto (1727&#150;1797) followed his father into state service and was both a counsellor in the war chancery and deputy master of horse. M&uuml;nchhausen was married again in October 1738, to Sophie Charlotte von der Schulenburg (1714&#150;1789), with whom he had another three children, two sons and a daughter: Gerlach Adolf (1739&#150;1778), named after his uncle, Georg (1754&#150;1800), and Amalia (1757&#150;1844).<br>
<br>M&uuml;nchhausen was granted the title of privy councillor in 1741 but did not begin active participation in the deliberations of the Hanoverian ministry until 1746. In 1748 M&uuml;nchhausen succeeded Ernst von Steinberg as head of the German chancery in London. The position of being the chief Hanoverian minister in London was a somewhat ambiguous one. The German chancery occupied a suite of rooms in St James's Palace and, theoretically, most decisions concerning the government of the electorate had to be channelled through it for the king to make a final ruling. In practice the monarch usually followed the advice of the ministers based in Hanover, so the opportunities for the minister in London to influence the direction of policy were limited. The role of the London ministry had been of vital importance only during the early Hanoverian period when the most important ministers, notably Andreas Gottlieb von Bernstorff and Hans Kaspar von Bothmer, had also been resident in the capital (although Count M&uuml;nster-Ledenburg was also to exploit the chancery to its full potential in the early nineteenth century). However, M&uuml;nchhausen benefited from the fact that his older brother was the key figure within the ministry in Hanover, and because Philipp was also an important conduit in the correspondence that developed between the duke of Newcastle and Gerlach von M&uuml;nchhausen in the aftermath of Newcastle's visit to Hanover in 1748.<br>
<br>Philipp von M&uuml;nchhausen also enjoyed an important, if somewhat minor, role as a channel of communication between members of the British government and the royal household in the 1750s. Newcastle was made aware of the extent to which Henry Fox involved M&uuml;nchhausen as an intermediary in his attempts to court the influential royal mistress the countess of Yarmouth in September 1754. M&uuml;nchhausen also kept George II appraised of the tortuous negotiations between the Pelhamite party and Henry Fox in the autumn of 1755, as well as maintaining useful contacts with the princess of Wales. M&uuml;nchhausen was also able to put his legal skills to good use and was consulted closely by the earl of Hardwicke when he considered the legal implications of the conversion of George II's son-in-law, Frederick, hereditary prince of Hesse-Cassel, to Catholicism and how best to protect the interests of George's daughter, Mary. Given the closeness of his contacts with the Pelhamite grouping and with the king, it is unsurprising that by July 1754 M&uuml;nchhausen had become the recipient of largesse from the secret service fund. He received &pound;1000 per annum, and this was continued by the third earl of Bute after George III's accession to the throne in 1760.<br>
<br>In the run-up to the outbreak of the Seven Years' War M&uuml;nchhausen was an important source of intelligence for the Hanoverian ministry. He was able to pass on the latest diplomatic gossip to his brother and to give guidance as to the direction of British strategic thinking, particularly as it might affect the electorate. M&uuml;nchhausen was also George II's chosen messenger in the difficult task of trying to persuade British ministers that the duke of Cumberland had exceeded his authority in signing the convention of Kloster-Zeven in 1757  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John, fourth duke of Bedford</span>, ed. J. Russell, 3 vols., 1842&#150;6, 2.277). M&uuml;nchhausen had previously been used by George II to suggest to the Danes that he had no quarrel with the French as elector of Hanover and to propose that a separate accommodation could be reached to preserve Hanover. Given the threat that Hanover was under during the French occupation it is unsurprising that in September 1757 Philipp raised with his brother the possibility of ending the dual monarchy. The elder M&uuml;nchhausen's response was simple: the union should only be preserved so long as the British wanted it to continue.<br>
<br>Philipp von M&uuml;nchhausen remained in London until 1762, when he returned to Hanover to become head of the war chancery. His tenure of his final appointment was short lived. He died at Hanover on 11 December 1762, having successfully negotiated the complex pathways of the British&#150;Hanoverian dual monarchy for over a decade and protected the electorate from neglect by the king-elector's British ministers. He was buried in the Gartenkirche, Hanover. The most infamous member of the family, Hieronymus Karl Friedrich von M&uuml;nchhausen (1720&#150;1797), whose stories were popularized by Rudolf Erich Raspe, was the first cousin of Philipp and Gerlach von M&uuml;nchhausen.<br>
