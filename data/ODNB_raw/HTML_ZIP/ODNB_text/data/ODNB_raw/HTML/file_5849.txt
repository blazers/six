<span class="headword">Cole,  George</span>  (1810&#150;1883), <span class="occ">landscape and animal painter</span>, was born on 15 January 1810 in London, the second child and only son of James Cole (1772&#150;1847) and Elizabeth Parker (<i>d</i>. 1819). Information about his early life is scanty: according to his grandson, Rex Vicat Cole, George Cole's father dissipated a fortune, and the boy began his life with no formal education as a ship's painter at Portsmouth. In another much repeated anecdote, recorded in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, he is at Wombwell's menagerie executing a canvas, measuring 20 feet by 20, of a tiger hunt in the jungle.<br>
<br>Cole's marriage in 1831 to Eliza Vicat (<i>d</i>. 1883), daughter of George and Catherine Vicat of Cosham, who were a Portsmouth Huguenot family, may have provided a starting point for his social and professional ascent. He was self-taught in art, and his surviving work from the 1840s includes portraits of individuals and, especially, of horses and dogs. He began to exhibit in London in 1838 and during the following decade experimented with a variety of genres, including animal painting, in which he gained considerable expertise, aiming to emulate Edwin Landseer and Thomas Sidney Cooper. He also produced a skilful <span class="italic">Still Life with Pheasant</span> (1847, City Art Gallery, Southampton) and a history painting, <span class="italic">Don Quixote and Sancho Panza</span> (exh. British Institution, 1840; photograph Courtauld Inst., Witt Library), which was much, though not always favourably, noticed.<br>
<br>By 1850 Cole had begun to concentrate on landscape, drawing on Dutch precedents for compositions such as <span class="italic">London Road, Portsdown</span> (1847, Portsmouth City Museum and Art Gallery). Working alongside him in the early 1850s was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5850/', "George Vicat Cole (1833&#150;1893)")</script>, the eldest of Cole's five children, who later became a more eminent artist than his father. In search of sketching grounds they visited the river valleys of the Wye, Teign, and Dart and, in 1851 or 1852, the Moselle. While the father undoubtedly instructed the son, it seems likely that the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism, absorbed more fully by the younger artist, was transmitted through his work to the father. After a temporary estrangement in 1855 the two never worked together again. George Cole's landscapes of the later 1850s are, however, less formulaic than his early works and are often a combination of rustic genre subjects with carefully observed landscape, as in <span class="italic">Landscape and Cattle</span> (1858, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth).<br>
<br>By 1852 Cole was confident enough to sell up and move to London. After three years at 2 Lewes Place, Fulham, he made his home and studio at 2 Kensington Crescent. Subsequently, after a decade of conspicuous financial success, he purchased the larger house next door, no. 1, in 1863, as well as a country residence, Coombe Lodge, near Liss in Hampshire. In a series of richly coloured and detailed landscapes on large canvases executed during the 1860s and 1870s, Cole created an idealized version of the Hampshire moorlands and agricultural landscape; examples include <span class="italic">Fern Carting, Harting Coombe</span> (1873, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth). Cattle continued to play an important role in his compositions, and he specialized in the depiction of river scenery with cows watering, including, for example, <span class="italic">Windsor Castle</span> (1876, exh. RA, 1878; Anglesey Abbey). Reassuring in their presentation of a seemingly timeless Englishness, these images were eagerly purchased by Victorian collectors.<br>
<br>Although he exhibited sixteen works at the Royal Academy, Cole's work formed a mainstay of the exhibitions of the Society of British Artists at Suffolk Street, where he exhibited 209 paintings from 1838 until his death in 1883. He was elected a member in 1850, became auditor in 1856, and vice-president in 1867. He was also awarded a medal for a harvesting scene in 1864 by the Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts. While, at his best, he was capable of sophisticated effects, the sheer volume of his production of smaller works, sold directly to dealers such as Thomas McLean and Arthur Tooth, inevitably led to a lowering of standards. His annual income rose from &pound;842 in 1858 to &pound;2580 in 1873.<br>
<br>A collector of topographical literature and an autodidact, Cole was reputed to know the works of Shakespeare by heart. Robert Chignell, the biographer of George Vicat Cole, saw the older painter as an exemplar of self-help: &#145;one who began with nothing&#146;, he had achieved success through &#145;great capabilities and force of character&#146;  (Chignell, 40). George Cole died on 7 September 1883 at his home at 1 Kensington Crescent and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London. Of his other children, Alfred Benjamin Cole was also an artist.<br>
