<span class="headword">Balme,  Matthew</span>  (1813&#150;1884), <span class="occ">factory reformer</span>, was born in Tong, Yorkshire, on 8 July 1813, the third son of Francis Balme (1742&#150;1819), a yeoman farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth West (<i>d</i>. 1846), of Redhill Farm, Dudley Hill, Bradford. He was baptized at St James's Church, Tong, in the parish of Birstall, a month later, and maintained a close association with the Church of England throughout his life. After losing his father at the age of six he became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Reverend George Stringer Bull, the evangelical curate of Bierley, near Bradford, who later described Balme affectionately as &#145;my old pupil at Bierley and afterwards my fellow labourer in the good work of youthful protection and instruction&#146;  (Ward, &#145;Balme&#146;, 226). On Bull's recommendation, he was appointed superintendent of the model factory school at Bowling, opened in October 1832 by John Wood, the leading Bradford tory evangelical worsted spinner, who had been instrumental in the conversion of Richard Oastler to the cause of factory reform in September 1830. Balme remained superintendent of Wood's school for fourteen years, and when Lord Ashley visited Bradford in 1844 he extolled the virtues of the school where &#145;500 children, under thirteen years of age, are receiving daily the benefits and blessings of a bringing up in the fear and nurture of the Lord&#146;  (ibid., 221). On 27 February 1843 Balme married Mary (1815&#150;1866), daughter of Joshua Milner, a Bradford tailor, with whom he had a daughter, Mary (1843&#150;1932). He subsequently entered local government as registrar for the townships of Bolton, Eccleshill, and Idle, and also served as clerk to the Bolton local board, playing a prominent role in both its foundation in 1865 and its controversial dissolution in 1873, when it became incorporated into the expanding borough of Bradford.<br>
<br>Although the early historians of the factory movement Samuel K. Kydd and Philip Grant recognized his energetic contribution to the success of the movement, Matthew Balme has been described by J. T. Ward, a later historian of the movement, as perhaps the least remembered of the nineteenth-century factory reformers, notwithstanding his steadfast commitment to the campaign for factory regulation from 1831 until 1874. As Balme informed the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science meeting in Bradford in October 1859, &#145;from his own knowledge and recollection&#146;, he could testify to the sufferings of &#145;children of tender age &hellip; required to toil in factories&#146; for excessive hours and experiencing &#145;cruelties of a revolting nature &hellip; often resulting in deformity, sometimes in death&#146;  (proceedings of Social Science Association meeting, Bradford, October 1859; Bradford Local Studies Library). As a schoolmaster he had first-hand acquaintance with the impact of the factory system on children, and supplied compelling factual evidence to the Bradford short-time committee, of which he became an early member, during Sadler's campaign for factory regulation in 1831. He became secretary of the Bradford committee in 1838, and of the West Riding committee in 1840. He was responsible for advising local committees throughout the county, correlating their reports and briefing the parliamentary leaders of the movement: Lord Ashley, with whom he maintained a warm personal correspondence for over forty years; John Fielden, who succeeded Ashley as parliamentary leader in 1846; and Lord John Manners, who led the parliamentary rearguard action in 1850 against the use of the relay system by manufacturers determined to circumvent the <span class="roman">Ten Hours Act</span> of 1847. He organized election canvassing, petitioning campaigns, and fund-raising drives. He also liaised with the Lancashire central committee, Richard Oastler (who was incarcerated in the Fleet debtors' prison in 1840&#150;44), and other parliamentary supporters of the movement, including leading churchmen, notably C. T. Longley, bishop of Ripon, who vigorously supported the campaign for factory reform in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>In many respects Balme typified the tory Anglican involvement in the movement, asserting the Conservative paternalistic ethos against the dominant <i>laissez-faire</i> economic doctrines of the influential West Riding Liberal dissenting manufacturers. On 25 April 1863 he was presented with a testimonial recognizing his key contribution to the development of the factory movement, providing &#145;the connecting link between the more wealthy of its supporters and its less fortunate advocates among the working classes themselves&#146;  (W. Yorks. AS, Matthew Balme Collection, deed box 4, case 9, item 80c). After ailing for some months Balme became seriously ill early in August 1884, and died at his home, Blakehill Cottage, Idle, Yorkshire, on 26 August 1884. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Bradford Observer</span> (27 August 1884) recalled approvingly that<blockquote>on all occasions when attending the meetings of operatives he never omitted to warn the workers against any acts that would bring them into conflict with their employers and as frequently reminded them that it was only by mutual forbearance that satisfactory results could be arrived at.</blockquote>A photograph of Balme in later life reveals a patriarchal profile, with a sympathetic demeanour, well-defined features, and long silvery-white hair, whiskers, and beard. He was buried in Calverley churchyard on 29 August 1884; a monument erected over his grave, paid for by the subscriptions of over 2000 factory operatives and a cluster of prominent public figures such as W. E. Forster and the earl of Shaftesbury, records that &#145;for upwards of fifty years he was a faithful and earnest advocate in promoting the physical, social and moral improvement of factory workers&#146;.<br>
