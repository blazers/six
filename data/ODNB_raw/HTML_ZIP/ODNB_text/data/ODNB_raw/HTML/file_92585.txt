<span class="headword">Henley, Sir  Douglas Owen</span>  (1919&#150;2003), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 5 April 1919 at 182 Venner Road, Beckenham, Kent, the elder of the two children (both sons) of Owen Henley (1876&#150;1943), an iron moulder's assistant who had served as a private in the Royal West Kent regiment during the First World War, and his wife, Beatrice Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hearn (1887&#150;1980). He was educated at Beckenham and Penge county school, from which he won a state scholarship and a Leverhulme scholarship to the London School of Economics in 1936. He took a first-class honours degree in economics, and won the Gonner prize and two postgraduate scholarships in 1939.<br>
<br>What might have been a distinguished academic career was stopped in its tracks by the Second World War. Henley did not take up his postgraduate scholarships, but joined the army in 1939, becoming a captain in the Queen's Own Royal West Kent regiment before serving as an intelligence officer with 12th infantry brigade. He saw service in north Africa in 1943 and in Italy and Greece in 1944. He was twice mentioned in dispatches in 1945. He married June Muriel Ibbetson (<i>b</i>. 1919), labour manager, and later a family psychotherapist, at St John's Church, Dormansland, Surrey, on 16 September 1942. She was the daughter of Thomas Henry Ibbetson, a chartered surveyor, of Dormansland. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>Henley joined the civil service in 1946 under the post-war reconstruction entry scheme, and thanks to his record as a student of economics was taken straight into the Treasury, an unusual distinction at a time when the Treasury was accustomed to recruit mainly from people who had shown sufficient promise in another department first. His early postings in the Treasury included two years from 1950 as private secretary to Sir Edwin Plowden, the chief of the economic planning staff, and a period of service as Treasury representative and financial controller in Tokyo and Singapore from 1956 to 1959. He became assistant under-secretary of state at the newly created Department of Economic Affairs in October 1964, and remained there until the department was wound up in 1969, when he returned as a deputy secretary to the Treasury. In 1972 he was promoted to be the second permanent secretary in charge of the public sector group. It was a time of change in that area of the Treasury's responsibilities, with renewed emphasis on the need to control public expenditure, and Henley initiated and supervised the design of a new system of cash limits and a new financial information system. He was made a CB in 1970 and knighted KCB in 1973.<br>
<br>In 1976 Henley was appointed comptroller and auditor-general, in charge of the Exchequer and Audit Department (later renamed the National Audit Office), the department responsible for advising the House of Commons (in practice the public accounts committee) on the audit of the accounts of government departments and other public-sector bodies, and for ensuring that money voted by parliament was applied to the purposes for which it was intended. He found a department set in its traditional ways, and somewhat inward-looking and departmentalized. With the support of his political masters he took the initiative in encouraging a broader approach than that of merely looking for faults and failures in the control of public expenditure, with the development of more progressive reviews and reports on value for money in public spending. He thus set the pattern for the way in which the National Audit Office was developed by his successors.<br>
<br>The qualities that stood out in Henley's working life were his total integrity, his quickness of understanding, his sureness of judgement, his directness, his approachability, and his total lack of pomposity or &#145;side&#146;. These qualities made him a much valued colleague, and enabled him to earn and deserve the confidence both of members of parliament and of government departments when he was comptroller and auditor-general. The warmth of his personality brought him many friends who held him in great affection. He was a man of wide interests: above all his family life with his wife and daughters, but also opera, gardening, walking, and fishing.<br>
<br>After his retirement from public service in 1981 Henley served until 1989 as chairman of the London Small Business Property Trust, and until 1990 as a consultant to Deloitte, Haskins and Sells. He was a member of council of the Girls' Public Day School Trust (GPDST) from 1981 to 2000, chairman of the governors of Alleyn's School, Dulwich, and a governor of a number of GPDST schools. He was made an honorary fellow of the London School of Economics in 1974, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bath in 1987. He died of cancer of the colon on 1 October 2003 at his home, Walwood House, Park Road, Banstead, Surrey. His wife and four daughters survived him. His body was cremated on 14 October 2003 at Randalls Park crematorium, and his ashes were interred at St Margaret's Church, Chipstead, Surrey.<br>
