<span class="headword">Wooldridge,  Harry Ellis</span>  (1845&#150;1917), <span class="occ">musician and artist</span>, was born on 28 March 1845 in the parish of St Lawrence in Winchester, Hampshire, the son of Harry Wooldridge, stationer and publisher, and his wife, Emma Frances Jones. He was educated privately before starting work at Lloyd's, but in 1865 he enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools, London. A friendship with Edward Burne-Jones encouraged Pre-Raphaelite sympathies and he embarked on a wide-ranging career in art and design in the late 1860s and the 1870s. He exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy, which were always well hung and the first of which was purchased by Frederic Leighton. A cabinet which he had decorated was placed in the South Kensington (later the Victoria and Albert) Museum, and he undertook commissions&#151;from G. F. Watts and T. G. Jackson, among others&#151;to execute murals and to design stained glass. His large reredos at St Martin's Church, Brighton, and many of the windows manufactured by James Powell &amp; Sons, in a Renaissance style, date from the 1870s. He also painted frescos in St John's Church, Hampstead, London.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Wooldridge was also exploring old Italian music in the British Museum. An accomplished singer from an early age, he now became interested in contrapuntal music and was asked to edit and revise William Chappell's <span class="italic">Popular Music of the Olden Time</span> under the new title of <span class="italic">Old English Popular Music</span> (1893). He omitted any songs which did not exist in early printed sources, rejecting popular tunes based on oral tradition, and he substituted his own harmonizations for those of G. A. Macfarren, who had harmonized the tunes in the original edition.<br>
<br>On 18 June 1894 Wooldridge married Julia Mary Olding (<i>b</i>. 1850/51), daughter of Stephen Olding, banker; they had no children. He was appointed Slade professor of fine art at Oxford in 1895, and was twice re-elected to the post from which he retired in 1904. From Trinity College, as an honorary MA (1895), he taught in rounded periods of Caroline diction and rhythm. In his inaugural lectures he reviewed theories of art from Plato to Hegel. While accepting much of Hegel's analysis, he criticized his attribution of artistic developments to entirely moral and political causes, pointing out the importance of newly discovered materials and methods and their exploration within artistic communities as forces for change.<br>
<br>Wooldridge collaborated with his friend, the poet Robert Bridges, on the <span class="italic">Yattendon Hymnal</span> (1899), and he served on the committee for the revision of <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span> but retired after several meetings, dissatisfied with the quality of the work. There are church settings and compositions by him in <span class="italic">Musica antiquata</span> (1907&#150;8, 1913): the combination of aesthetic sensibilities with scholarly knowledge here shown identifies the best of these simple four-part polyphonic settings with the workmanship of the original masters. For the Purcell Society he edited <span class="italic">Three Odes for St Cecilia's Day</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">Birthday Odes for Queen Mary</span> (1902). While at Oxford he was asked to contribute the first volume of the <span class="italic">Oxford History of Music</span>, for which he conducted much obscure research: his two volumes, <span class="italic">The Polyphonic Period</span> (1901 and 1905), traced the development of polyphonic music to the end of the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Wooldridge had a well-formed and thickset frame, blue eyes, and a ruddy auburn beard trimmed like a Frenchman's. Punctilious in dress and manners, he was a good raconteur and mimic. Although generous and genial, he was notably intolerant of pretension, particularly of the artistic kind. His knowledge of Latin and Greek was poor, but he spoke French and Italian like a native and was extremely well read. Wooldridge died at his home, 90 Oakwood Court, Kensington, London, on 13 February 1917. He was survived by his wife.<br>
