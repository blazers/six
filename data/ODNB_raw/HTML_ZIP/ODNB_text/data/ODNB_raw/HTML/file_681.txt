<span class="headword">Arnold,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1521), <span class="occ">merchant and chronicler</span>, was a citizen of London, resident in the parish of St Magnus the Martyr, who seems to have made his living primarily by trading with Flanders. Nothing is known of his parentage. In 1473 he was an executor of the will of John Arnell the elder, a London cutler, and is there described as a haberdasher, meaning an importer and vendor of small pieces of merchandise. In 1488 he was imprisoned in Flanders on suspicion of being a spy, and he includes in his chronicle an undated pardon from Henry VII or Henry VIII clearing him of &#145;all manner of treasons&#146; as well as rape. Many of the other documents that Arnold reproduces, such as &#145;The form of an award&#146; given by arbitration and &#145;Another letter of exchange&#146;, are taken from his evidently turbulent commercial life. He married a woman whose first name was Alice, and had a son, Nicholas. No record exists of his death, although he must have been at least twenty-one in 1473. Arnold's nineteenth-century editor, Francis Douce, therefore postulates that Arnold died about 1521, after the last impression of his book, when he would have been approximately seventy years of age.<br>
<br>Arnold is remembered principally for the text known today as Arnold's chronicle, a compilation that begins with a short London chronicle, a genre that records history from the standpoint of the London merchant and organized according to the mayoral rather than the regnal year. Although many of the London chronicles record events with little commentary or narrative, they were evidently very important to their authors and to London's mercantile community generally, being often continued by several generations of merchants and copied by professional scribes.<br>
<br>Arnold's work has not been treated very kindly by present-day scholars, who dismiss it as a mere hotchpotch. Such contempt, however, contrasts with the work's reception by contemporaries like Holinshed, Bale, and John Stow, the last of whom, in his description of the authors he consulted for his <span class="italic">Summary of English Chronicles</span>, praises Arnold as:<blockquote>a citizen of London, who, being inflamed with the fervent love of good learning, travailed very studiously therein, and principally in observing matters worthy to be remembered of the posterity; he noted the charters, liberties, laws, constitutions and customs of the city of London. (Arnold, 2)</blockquote>Furthermore Arnold's chronicle formed the basis of two other London chronicles, the one an anonymous work in MS Tanner 2 in the Bodleian Library, the other the chronicle of Charles Wriothesley, whose early pages are taken verbatim from Arnold.<br>
<br>Arnold's text can certainly seem unprepossessing, an intermingling of such material as documents on civic land tenure, forms for the &#145;making of indebtors&#146;, instructions for making vinegar or soap, and the earliest extant version of the very popular &#145;Ballad of the Nut-Brown Maid&#146;. But it can be argued that modern scholars have unrealistic expectations of a text that is more appropriately regarded as a commonplace book which includes a short chronicle and a collection of important documents, altogether providing valuable evidence for London's awareness of itself as an almost autonomous political entity. While most of the text appears to be randomly compiled, it is significant that he begins with a list of London's mayors and continues with &#145;The articles of the charter of London&#146; and &#145;The whole charter of London, with cxii articles&#146;. These texts contain such provisions as &#145;That the city of London have all her liberties and free usages as well written as not written as they had in the times of Saint Edward King and Confessor and of William Conqueror and of other their progenitors&#146;, and &#145;That no summons, attachment, or execution be made by any ministers of our lord the King within the liberty by writ or without writ, but by the ministers of the same city.&#146; The contemporary popularity of Arnold's chronicle may thus have arisen less from its narrative merits than from its value in providing easily accessible evidence for both the legal status and constitutional history of London.<br>
<br>Arnold's book was first published probably in 1503 by A. van Berghen of Antwerp, although the title-page gives no indication of date, place, or printer, under the descriptive title <span class="italic">In this book is contained the names of the bailiffs, custose <span class="roman">[custodians]</span>, mayors and sheriffs of the city of London from the time of King Richard the First &hellip;</span>; it was reprinted probably in 1525 by Peter Treveris of London, whose edition extends the list of mayors to Henry VIII's eleventh regnal year (1519&#150;20), but is otherwise identical with the first. The most recent edition, published in 1811, was that of Francis Douce, who changed the title to <span class="italic">The Customs of London, otherwise called Arnold's Chronicle</span>.<br>
