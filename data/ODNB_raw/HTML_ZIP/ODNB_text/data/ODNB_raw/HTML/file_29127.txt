<span class="headword">Weston, Sir  Richard</span>  (1578/9&#150;1658?), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the son of Ralph Weston (<i>d</i>. 1605) of Rugeley, Staffordshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of George Smyth of Appleton, Lancashire. He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 14 October 1596, aged seventeen, and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1599. About 1605 he married Anne, daughter of Richard Barbour of Hilderstone; they had three children, Elizabeth, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1608/9), and Ralph. Weston was called to the bar in 1607. Six years later he inherited the family estates at Rugeley on the death of his grandfather, Philip Weston.<br>
<br>In 1621 Weston was elected as MP for Lichfield. Like his namesake, the chancellor of the exchequer and future earl of Portland, he was an active member. In June he obtained for himself and his son Richard the office of pretermitted customs in the port of London but in the course of acting as solicitor for alehouse keepers, who were petitioning parliament, was temporarily committed by the house to prison. For many years Weston was a Staffordshire JP. He became a bencher of his inn in 1626 and a judge on the Welsh circuit in 1632. On 19 April 1634 he was created serjeant-at-law and subsequently, on 6 May, became baron of the exchequer in place of his recently deceased kinsman Sir James Weston, probably at the behest of Portland.<br>
<br>Weston suffered from a pronounced lameness in one leg: he remarked at his investiture as serjeant &#145;that he was himself soe lame of the left leg, but he was upright of the right syde and that he knew he would be soe, his hart was right&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Serjeants</span>, 370). He appears to have been largely confined to the unpopular home circuit throughout his career, although this may have been a concession to his disability which would have made travelling difficult. He was knighted at Whitehall on 7 December 1635. In 1638 he was one of seven judges who, in <i>Hampden's case</i>, affirmed the crown's right to collect ship money. His opinion is of some significance. Weston affirmed that the king could act independently of parliament as sole judge of when the kingdom was in imminent danger, and that he himself was convinced that such a danger currently existed from foreign navies. Furthermore, he concluded that the form of the ship money writ was good in law and that ship money extended to the nineteen inland counties and not just to the thirty-three maritime counties. He justified his opinion not simply with a direct appeal to the equity of &#145;necessity&#146; of the matter, but also with an appeal to precedent and English history, citing previous &#145;custom and usage&#146; in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.1265&#150;78).<br>
<br>In the two elections of 1640 Richard Weston the younger was elected MP for Stafford; he probably voted against the attainder of Strafford. The following year Weston senior was one of six judges impeached and imprisoned by parliament for their support of ship money, although he was not brought to trial. Both father and son seem to have joined the king in August 1642; the latter was disabled from parliament on 30 October that year, while the former was disabled from the judiciary on 24 October 1645 &#145;as though he was dead&#146;. By this time the family's estates in Staffordshire had been plundered, and on 29 March 1645 the county committee ordered that Lady Weston hold the lands of her husband, described as a delinquent, in return for &pound;104 a year.<br>
<br>The Westons' misfortunes may have been somewhat mitigated by the fact that both their son-in-law Richard Floyer and Lady Weston's nephew Leicester Barbour were committee members, but the family continued to suffer for its royalism. Richard Weston the younger, who had become a colonel, was taken prisoner at Colchester in July 1648 and was killed in the king's service on the Isle of Man in 1652 (a date often erroneously given for his father's death). Weston himself was described as a &#145;papist&#146; in 1648, and by the time he drew up his will on 18 November 1655 reckoned that &#145;these late troublesome times have much impoverished me&#146; just as &#145;the late death of my late dear wife hath much troubled my mind&#146;. The disposition of his remaining goods was left to his executors, his son Ralph and his grandsons Philip (son of Richard the younger and his wife, Catherine Cockayne) and John. Weston probably died on 18 March 1658; Ralph obtained probate of the will on 17 April 1660 and Philip succeeded to the family estates.<br>
