<span class="headword">Foxcroft <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jones]</span>,  Helen Charlotte</span>  (1865&#150;1950), <span class="occ">historian and literary editor</span>, was born on 12 December 1865 at Hinton House, Hinton Charterhouse, Somerset, the eldest of the seven surviving children (two sons and five daughters) of Edward Talbot Day Jones (1837&#150;1911) of Hinton House and his wife, Wilhelmina Colquhoun (1841&#150;1910), daughter of Robert Robertson-Glasgow of Montgreenan, Ayrshire, and Mary Campbell. In 1868 Edward Jones adopted the name of Foxcroft on inheriting the Foxcroft property of Halsteads, in Ingleton, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Like many daughters of Victorian gentry Helen Foxcroft was educated at home but by 1886 she had enrolled for &#145;instruction by correspondence&#146; at Newnham College, Cambridge. From these modest beginnings she developed a passion and a gift for historical research, which in the early 1890s she focused on the life and writings of the Restoration statesman George Savile, first marquess of Halifax (1633&#150;1695), &#145;the Trimmer&#146;. She was an unusually quick and efficient researcher. Though only a private scholar, in two years she amassed from public and private archives a huge body of material, with the ambitious objective not only of completing a &#145;Life and letters&#146; of Halifax but an edition, too, of his writings, of which the best known are <span class="italic">The Character of a Trimmer</span>, <span class="italic">A Letter to a Dissenter</span>, <span class="italic">Advice to a Daughter</span>, and <span class="italic">A Character of King Charles the Second</span>.<br>
<br>It was difficult to find a publisher for such an undertaking; during 1894&#150;6 Foxcroft negotiated with John Murray, Macmillan, and the Clarendon Press, but all declined. At last Longmans, Green &amp; Co., to their credit, took it on, and in September 1898 they published in two volumes <span class="italic">The life and letters of Sir George Savile, bart., first marquis of Halifax &amp;c. With a new edition of his works now for the first time collected and revised</span>. Longmans, Green &amp; Co. soon found (1901) that this already old-fashioned example of a &#145;life and letters&#146; was slow to sell. The book's complex documentation, and perhaps the elevated formality of Foxcroft's style, deterred the common reader; more than half the 1000 copies printed were eventually remaindered or destroyed. But her work was welcomed by scholars. Even before publication Thomas Seccombe made substantial use of her manuscript for his article on Halifax in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. C. H. Firth reviewed it in the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> (vol. 14, January 1899). He recognized that it would not attract the general public but he judged it &#145;a contribution of very great value to the history of the later Stuarts and the Revolution&#146; and noted &#145;much hitherto unpublished or uncollected material&#146;. An example of this was Halifax's record of conversations with William III, discovered by Foxcroft in the Spencer archives. Over the years she continued to receive friendly encouragement from Firth.<br>
<br>Though not easy to come by, Foxcroft's edition of Halifax's writings (265 pp. in part 2 of the <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>) held its own for ninety years as the standard edition, textually superior to the editions by Raleigh (1912) and by Kenyon (1969). It has now been superseded by Mark N. Brown's edition of the works (3 vols., 1989), which incorporates extensive new material unknown to Foxcroft, from drafts in Halifax's hand.<br>
<br>As a biographer of Halifax, Foxcroft believed in the greatness of her subject, though not uncritically. The occasionally distorting effects of this predisposition in Halifax's favour have been demonstrated, and amply offset, in Brown's own commentaries in his edition. Nevertheless the biography has not been superseded as the quarry for others that she intended it to be. The &#145;short life&#146; of Halifax that she published in her old age, <span class="italic">A Character of the Trimmer</span> (1946), is essentially a condensation of the original work, with some updating.<br>
<br>Foxcroft was also an authority on the historian and bishop Gilbert Burnet, Halifax's one-time ally and correspondent. In her <span class="italic">Supplement to Burnet's History of my Own Time</span> (1902), still important, she revealed what was gained and lost when Burnet revised his manuscript memoirs of the 1680s for his later history. She edited Burnet's letters to Halifax (1907) and contributed a major part to a life of Burnet (1907), with T. E. S. Clarke.<br>
<br>Helen Foxcroft spent almost all her life at Hinton Charterhouse, where her strong sense of civic duty led her to give much time to political and welfare causes. She supported her brother Charles Talbot Foxcroft, MP for Bath, as speech-writer and researcher, from 1919 until his death in 1929. A devoted Conservative, she lectured and wrote widely on political subjects. She served as a magistrate from 1930 to 1945, and for forty-five years worked for the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association. A neighbour who knew her well thought her &#145;a fine lady, but reserved, not a gossip; and absent-minded&#146;  (private information). She was in many ways eccentric: determined to fly, she found an airman to pilot her round Salisbury Plain in 1913. She loved Somerset, its history, its countryside, and its people. Losing her sight towards the end, she died, unmarried, at Hinton House on 6 July 1950; she was buried on 8 July at the church of St John the Baptist, Hinton Charterhouse.<br>
