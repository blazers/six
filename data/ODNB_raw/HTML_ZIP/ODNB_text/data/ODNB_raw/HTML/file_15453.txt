<span class="headword">Ker,  John</span>  (1819&#150;1886), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church</span>, was born in the farmhouse of Bield, in the parish of Tweedsmuir, Peeblesshire, on 7 April 1819. His parents moved successively to Fillyside, a farm between Leith and Portobello, and to Abbeyhill, Edinburgh. While his father adhered to the established church, his mother was a seceder, and through that connection young John was exposed to the ministry of John Brown (1784&#150;1858). After education at Edinburgh high school, Ker entered Edinburgh University in 1835 and distinguished himself in Sir William Hamilton's class, where he gained first prize. In 1838 he entered the Divinity Hall of the United Secession church. He also studied French and German, in the latter case committing an entire dictionary to memory, as well as Hebrew and Arabic. In 1842 Ker travelled to Germany, where he studied under Tholuck at Halle for six months.<br>
<br>Licensed in 1844, Ker was called by the congregation of Clayport Street, Alnwick, Northumberland, to which he was ordained on 11 February 1845. He was reluctant to move from there, and it was only at the second attempt that he was translated to East Campbell Street Church, Glasgow, where he was inducted colleague to Dr Kidston and Mr Brash on 19 March 1851. The vigorous young minister soon arrested the decline in the congregation's fortunes and he embarked on an intensive pastoral ministry. He turned down a call to a Bristol charge and similarly declined a request to become his church's first home mission secretary. An expanded church with seating for 1200 was erected in Sydney Place, but Ker's health broke down in 1858 and thereafter he spent much time on the continent. A partial recovery of health allowed him to perform the duties of professor of practical training in the United Presbyterian College from 1876. It was a role to which he was perfectly suited and he was able to discharge his duties up to the time of his sudden death, from heart disease, at The Hermitage, Murrayfield, Edinburgh, where he lived with a married sister, on 4 October 1886. Ker was buried in the new Calton cemetery, Edinburgh, on 7 October.<br>
<br>In spite of the inhibiting influence of poor health and although he lacked the attributes of a conventional leader, Ker was seen by contemporaries as one of the leading figures in his church. As a preacher he bore comparison with William Bruce Robertson (1820&#150;1886), and his published <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1869) were hugely popular. His humour, learning, and graciousness endeared him to all he met: &#145;In the pulpit he was a king, in the class-room a master, in social life lovable, among ripe scholars and grand men the equal of the best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Leader</span>, 2 Dec 1886, 734). The travel and leisure forced on him enabled Ker to be still more cultured, and he was a keen antiquarian with a wide knowledge of Scottish history and an equal interest in current affairs. In 1869 he received the honorary degree of DD from Edinburgh University.<br>
