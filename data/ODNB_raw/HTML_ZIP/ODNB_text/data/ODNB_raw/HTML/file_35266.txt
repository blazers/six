</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Noyes,  Alfred</span>  (1880&#150;1958), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 16 September 1880 in St Mark's Road, Wolverhampton, the son of Alfred Noyes, a grocer who later became a teacher, and his wife, Amelia Adams, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rowley. He went to school in Aberystwyth, where he developed a lifelong enthusiasm for boats and the sea. His father, a devout Anglican, had been prevented by financial difficulties from going to university, but the young Noyes entered Exeter College, Oxford, in 1898. Here he gave much of his time to rowing, and this interest continued throughout his life.<br>
<br>Noyes was supposed to be studying for a degree in English under the aegis of Ernest de Selincourt. Instead of taking his final examinations, however, he travelled to London to fulfil an appointment with Grant Richards, a publisher who had become interested in Noyes's poems, and published them as <span class="italic">The Loom of Years</span> (1902). It can now be perceived that Noyes's poetry, essentially looking back to his great idol, Tennyson, appealed to a generation of elderly men who dominated the literary establishment of the time. A crucial admirer was R. C. Lehmann, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, who introduced Noyes to H. W. Massingham of <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and J. A. Spender of the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>. These influential periodicals published many of the young writer's poems.<br>
<br>Noyes's most signal triumph came early, in the form of his poem &#145;The Highwayman&#146;, a characteristically atavistic subject. The subject occurred to him when he was twenty-four, living at Bagshot Heath. Noyes records that it was a blustery night that inspired the famous first section:<blockquote>
<div>The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.<br>
</div>
<div>The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.<br>
</div>
<div>The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,<br>
</div>
<div>And the highwayman came riding&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>Riding&#151;riding&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Readers who do not consciously recall Noyes's name may none the less recognize this piece, as for half a century and more hardly a school anthology was complete without it. The poem was collected, with many in a similar vein, in such volumes as <span class="italic">Forty Singing Seamen</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Tales of the Mermaid Tavern</span> (1912), and successive volumes of <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1910, 1913, 1920). These poems, compounded of books rather than perceptions, were equipped with stirring metres that could be fairly said to have put a spin on the familiar form of the ballad. This formula, resembling that enjoyed in Victorian verse collections, ensured that for a time Noyes was lauded as the true successor of Tennyson. Noyes himself was an explicit opponent of anything that he deemed to be contemporary realism. His book <span class="italic">Some Aspects of Modern Poetry</span> (1924) pillories various unnamed writers as &#145;destructive forces&#146;.<br>
<br>For some time now, Noyes had been able to earn his living by writing verse. He supplemented this by giving lectures in the United States. He had strong connections with America through his wife, (Kate) Garnett Upham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Daniels (1881/2&#150;1926), whom he had married on 25 July 1907; she was the daughter of the American consul, Colonel Byron Gordon Daniels. The first of Noyes's tours was suggested in 1911 by Frederick A. Stokes, his American publisher, and arranged by an agency, William B. Feakins Inc. Noyes was invited in 1913 to give the Lowell lecture at Harvard; his chosen title was &#145;The sea in English literature&#146;. His delivery was no doubt enhanced by a resonant voice, a sturdy physique, and a forehead of distinction emphasized by his increasing baldness. Out of this performance came (in 1914) an appointment as Murray professor of English literature at Princeton University. There he lectured twice a week for half of each college year. Among his auditors were Edmund Wilson and F. Scott Fitzgerald. He continued in this post until 1923. Necessarily, his tenure was interrupted by the First World War, and although he was rejected for military service on the grounds of poor eyesight, 1916 found him working for the Foreign Office in the news room, the precursor of the Ministry of Information. Here he got into trouble for writing a book about methods of trapping enemy submarines. The censure was lifted, however, when it was found that all the information supplied by Noyes was already in the public domain.<br>
<br>Noyes's first wife died suddenly in 1926, shortly after they had visited the monastery at Roncesvalles. Within the year, Noyes entered the Roman Catholic church, and on 27 September 1927 married Mary Angela Weld-Blundell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mayne (1889&#150;1976), herself a member of an old Catholic family, and the widow of an officer killed in the war. They settled first in London, where Noyes had preserved his many literary acquaintances, and, from 1929, on the Isle of Wight. From 1926 to 1930 Noyes produced a three-volume history of science called <span class="italic">The Torch-Bearers</span>. More importantly, however, and one of the fruits of his conversion, was a biography of Voltaire (1936), which sought to exculpate that philosopher from charges of atheism.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Noyes moved with his wife and their three young children to Canada and the United States, where he continued to give his lectures. His vision had continued to deteriorate, and a disastrous operation for glaucoma in the mid-1940s ensured that he would never read again. The Noyes family returned to the Isle of Wight in 1949, where Noyes managed to continue with his studies. As late as 1957 Noyes produced a book persuasively seeking to exonerate the Irish patriot Roger Casement from authorship of some homosexual diaries with which he had been smeared as part of the prosecution in a trial for treason. Noyes had been shown a typescript of these diaries during his time with the Foreign Office, and had at that time thought them genuine, but came to revise his opinion.<br>
<br>Alfred Noyes died at the Isle of Wight County Hospital in Ryde on 28 June 1958, aged seventy-seven; he was buried at St Saviour's Roman Catholic church, Totland, on the Isle of Wight. He had received honorary doctorates from Yale, Glasgow, Berkeley, and Syracuse, and in 1918 had been appointed CBE. Little of his work has held public attention, apart from &#145;The Highwayman&#146;, among other anthologized poems. One such poem, found in Philip Larkin's <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Twentieth-Century Verse</span>, genuinely deserves a place in the canon: &#145;Spring, and the Blind Children&#146; uses failing eyesight as an allegory of the vain attempt on the part of humankind to understand the providence of God.<br>
