<span class="headword">Higgins,  Frederick Robert</span>  (1896&#150;1941), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 24 April 1896 in Foxford, co. Mayo, the eldest of the nine children of Joseph Higgins, a police constable, and his wife, Annie French. His father, a protestant unionist, was from Higginstown, Trim, co. Meath, where Higgins spent childhood holidays with relatives. After completing a national school education Higgins started work in 1912 as a junior clerk with Brooks Thomas, the main builders' providers in Dublin. Influenced by the nationalism of the literary revival, he identified with Sinn F&eacute;in, and he became estranged from his father over his refusal to enlist in the British army during the First World War, which led to his departure from the family home in Fairview, Dublin. Higgins left Brooks Thomas and, in 1918, became a secretary with the Clerical Workers' Union, where he found that his &#145;contact with mechanical industry intensified a passion for primitive nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Herald</span>). This passion found expression in the poetry he had begun to write. The rhythms of Irish airs and ballads are also clearly evident in his early poems, which were greatly influenced by Douglas Hyde's <span class="italic">Love Songs of Connaught</span>. He befriended Austin Clarke in 1915 and George Russell (&AElig;) encouraged the young poet.<br>
<br>Having founded a paper, the <span class="italic">Irish Clerk</span>, Higgins left the Clerical Workers' Union in 1920, edited several trade journals such as <span class="italic">Oil and Colour Paint Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Furniture Man's Gazetteer</span>, and established the first women's magazine in Ireland, <span class="italic">Welfare</span>, which ran for two issues. He also worked as a contributing editor to several literary magazines, including <span class="italic">The Klaxon</span> and <span class="italic">To-Morrow</span>.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1921 Higgins married a well-known harpist, Beatrice May, daughter of James Moore, a boat maker of Clontarf, Dublin. The couple set up home in Rathfarnham, co. Dublin; they had no children. Higgins won the 1924 Aonach Tailteann award for poetry for his first collection of poems, <span class="italic">Salt Air</span>, which had been published in 1923 by the Irish Bookshop. He was a pastoral poet who found inspiration in the rugged Connemara landscape, in <span class="italic">Island Blood</span> (1925), for example, and in the lush pastures of co. Meath and the Boyne valley. His work reflected a strong sense of tradition and he drew on Gaelic modes of poetry to write in the &#145;Celtic&#146; manner pioneered by Austin Clarke and Padraic Colum in such poems as &#145;The Island Dead of Inchagoill&#146; (in <span class="italic">The Dark Breed</span>, 1927). A major theme was the passing of the Gaelic way of life. Highly regarded by his peers, Higgins was a fastidious craftsman, working and reworking a poem until he was completely satisfied.<br>
<br>From 1928 to 1932 Higgins was the Aonach Tailteann adjudicator of poetry, and also served as professor of poetry at the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts. In 1932 he was a foundation member of the Irish Academy of Letters, which was the brainchild of Yeats and had George Bernard Shaw as its first president. The academy's aim was to combat literary censorship by &#145;giving authority to the utterance&#146; of Irish writers. Higgins was honorary secretary from 1936 to 1941. He was awarded the Casement medal by the academy for his collection <span class="italic">Arable Holdings</span> (1933). His poem &#145;The Past Generation&#146; (1936), first published in the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span>, to which Higgins regularly contributed, signalled a shift away from lyricism and showed the influence of Yeats.<br>
<br>Despite joining in the condemnation of Sean O'Casey's <span class="italic">The Plough and the Stars</span> in 1926, attacking both the playwright and his defender W. B. Yeats, by the mid-1930s Higgins and Yeats had become close friends. He contributed to an <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> supplement to mark Yeats's seventieth birthday in 1935, while Yeats championed Higgins and included him in the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Modern Verse</span> (1936), and in 1937 selected poems by him for BBC and Irish radio programmes. Higgins was involved in the publication of <span class="italic">Broadsides</span>, a series of illustrated broadsheets published by the Yeats family-owned Cuala Press, of which in 1937 he became an editorial director. In April 1935 Higgins was appointed to the board of the Abbey Theatre (the national theatre of Ireland founded by Yeats), which prompted the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> to hope that he might &#145;bring back to the Irish theatre something of its first poetic impulse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>). In September 1935 Higgins's only play to be performed, <span class="italic">A Deuce of Jacks</span> (a one-act, low-life comedy set in early nineteenth-century Dublin), was staged at the Abbey. It was not well received by the critics; the <span class="italic">Dublin Evening Mail</span> reviewer wrote that it exhibited &#145;a supreme contempt for what a play should be&#146;. Higgins enjoyed greater success in 1937 as manager of the Abbey company's tour of the United States, which took in seventy-four cities (he became managing director of the Abbey Theatre in 1938). He brought energy, vision, and a keen business sense to the job, and his policy of staging new plays revived the theatre's artistic fortunes, doing away with the need for revivals. As part of the Abbey Festival in August 1938 Higgins delivered a lecture, &#145;Yeats and Irish drama&#146;, in which he expounded his views on theatre. He called on dramatists to ignore box-office considerations, which he thought had a cheapening influence on a literary theatre. He argued for plays that would generate intellectual excitement, thereby making the theatre a place where the mind would be liberated as it was by the theatres of Greece, England, and France at great moments in their history. He disliked any trace of effeminacy in literature; art had to be masculine and intellectual.<br>
<br>Higgins was of stout build with a bespectacled, plump face and a shock of dark hair. He was a boisterous character with a taste for alcohol and malicious gossip. He fed Yeats's appetite for dirty stories with tall tales of his own sexual exploits which he later recounted for the amusement of Dublin's literati. His main recreation, according to <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, was &#145;gallivanting in the country&#146;. Higgins was an active member of the Church of Ireland. He was a member of the Boys' Brigade and, in 1932, he helped to publicize the church's celebration marking the 1500th anniversary of St Patrick's arrival in Ireland. He saw the Church of Ireland as the true successor of the early Celtic church and the home for the natural piety of a pastoral people. Higgins's last poetry collection was <span class="italic">A Gap of Brightness</span> (1940). He suffered from heart disease and died in Jervis Street Hospital, Dublin, on 8 January 1941. He was buried in Laracor, co. Meath, on 10 January 1941.<br>
