<span class="headword">Smith,  May</span>  (1879&#150;1968), <span class="occ">industrial psychologist</span>, was born on 29 August 1879 at 44 Russell Street, Hulme, Chorlton, Lancashire, the elder of the two daughters of Thomas Smith, an iron turner, and his wife, Augusta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mathews. May Smith's father, though austere in his religious views (denouncing pastimes such as dancing as sinful), had equally strong literary and philosophical interests which ensured that discussions on such matters were commonplace within the home. After attending Manchester Science School, where she was also a pupil teacher, Smith won an education scholarship to Owens College, Manchester. Graduating with a BA that had included philosophy (and a little psychology) and a London University (external) diploma in education in 1903, she then taught for the next two years in the practising school associated with the education department.<br>
<br>In 1905 Smith was appointed lecturer in educational psychology at Cherwell Hall, a training college for secondary school teachers in Oxford. Having also arranged to study in Oxford for her Manchester MA in philosophy, she began attending William McDougall's psychology lectures and eventually joined his small group of pupils studying experimental psychology. Although her first taste of research was as McDougall's assistant, Smith soon branched out into independent work on the effects of sleep deprivation on mental functioning. Later, a collaborative study with McDougall concerning alcohol and certain drugs led to an official request during the First World War to examine possible links between drink and prostitution. This lengthy, if inconclusive, inquiry equipped her with valuable interviewing and reporting skills.<br>
<br>Smith's qualities as a researcher were eventually recognized and, at the age of forty, she found herself starting a new career with the newly established Industrial Health Research Board (IHRB), a post she held from 1920 until officially retiring in 1944. She was awarded a DSc by London University in 1930 and appointed OBE in 1945 for her services as a pioneer industrial psychologist. It was entirely characteristic of Smith's pragmatic style of research that to prepare for her first IHRB investigation, on fatigue and working hours in the laundry trade, she experienced the tasks at first hand, incidentally acquiring some basic skills, while spending several weeks as a laundry worker. During the investigation itself, she earned much goodwill and co-operation from managers and workforces alike by shrewdly helping out with the actual laundry work at busy times. Contemporaries, too, found her friendly and unpretentious, praised her good sense and also admired her knack of judging exactly how indiscreet she could be with her gossip.<br>
<br>In the late 1920s opportunities for collaborating with researchers from other fields opened up when Smith and several other IHRB investigators moved into the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In addition to a long-standing collaboration with Major Greenwood, professor of epidemiology and vital statistics, a partnership with the professor of medical psychology, Millais Culpin, forged during a study of the condition known as telegraphists' cramp, proved to be especially significant for the development of industrial psychology. Initially, it was assumed that the condition was associated with fatigue until Culpin brought his experience of war neuroses to the work and evidence began to emerge of a psychoneurotic element. Subsequent studies on other groups of workers suggested that a &#145;nervous&#146; factor contributed similarly to many occupational illnesses. Her book, <span class="italic">An Introduction to Industrial Psychology</span>, published in 1943, did much to introduce the wider world to the notion that applying psychological ideas could be of benefit in the workplace.<br>
<br>May Smith was anything but idle after leaving the IHRB in 1944. The following year she became a part-time lecturer in applied psychology at Birkbeck College, London, retiring only in 1955. From as early as 1914 she had been a stalwart of the British Psychological Society, serving in various capacities including honorary librarian (1932&#150;59) and deputy president (1948&#150;54). On 21 February 1968 she died, aged eighty-eight, at Otto House, 44 Sydenham Hill, Lewisham, London. She was unmarried.<br>
