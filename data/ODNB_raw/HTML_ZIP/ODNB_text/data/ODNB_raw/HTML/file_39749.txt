<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tatersal,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1734&#150;1735), <span class="occ">poet and bricklayer</span>, is an obscure figure. Nothing is known of his origins or life beyond the publication in 1734 and 1735 of a two-part collection of poems entitled <span class="italic">The Bricklayer's Miscellany</span>. The work is described as &#145;in allusion to Stephen Duck&#146; and is both heavily indebted to the successful thresher poet and aspiring to similar recognition.<br>
<br>The preface to <span class="italic">The Bricklayer's Miscellany</span> reveals Tatersal to be &#145;A poor country bricklayer of Kingston upon Thames&#146;. The poems have been written during the winter,<blockquote>wherein I had not the employment to exercise the more material business of my calling &hellip; For the gentlemen of our profession I may not improperly compare to cuckoos who are brisk and gay &hellip; so long as the summer endures, but when winter approaches retire to their respective cells. (Tatersal, <span class="italic">Bricklayer's Miscellany, Second Part</span>)</blockquote>Tatersal's minor collection of verses is significant for the light it casts on the nine-days-wonder phenomenon of Stephen Duck, and on the working life of a jobbing bricklayer in the 1730s. Tatersal is engagingly candid about his calling, especially on its seasonal ups and downs&#151;in winter &#145;you may behold him, with an empty purse, forlorn and dirty&#146; contenting himself with &#145;a few boil'd sprats and a dram of gin (which are a dish of great repute among bricklayers in the winter season&#146;. In the summer, by contrast, when the sun &#145;begins to dart his oblique rays over Hampstead Hill; then we begin to look as sharp after a job, as a hound after a hare&#146;  (Tatersal, <span class="italic">Bricklayer's Miscellany, Second Part</span>, i&#150;iii).<br>
<br>The title poem of Tatersal's collection &#145;The Bricklayer's Labour&#146; is a competently written, lively, and informative descriptive poem of the daily work of a bricklayer:<blockquote>
<div>&#145;A line, a line,&#146; the foreman cries, &#145;my boys&#146;,<br>
</div>
<div>When tuck and pat with Flemish bond they run,<br>
</div>
<div>Till the whole course is struck complete and done.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The echoes of Duck are very strong, and Tatersal is clearly hoping to attract something of the thresher's fame.<blockquote>
<div>Since rustick Threshers entertain the Muse<br>
</div>
<div>Why may not bricklayers their subjects chuse?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>proclaims the title page, and he adds: &#145;O happy Stephen! Were my life like thine&#146;  (Tatersal, <span class="italic">Bricklayer's Miscellany, Second Part</span>, 1). He uses an apposite conceit in invoking the &#145;trowel&#146; of Ben Jonson to validate his claim as a literary bricklayer, despite the modern preference for the &#145;stupendous flail&#146;.<br>
<br>In an advertisement in the endpapers of <span class="italic">The Second Part</span> Tatersal offers his services not only as bricklayer and surveyor, but also as tutor in &#145;writing, arithmetick, geometry and dialling&#146;. The advertisement refers to one William Tatersal&#151;presumably a close relative&#151;as a writing-master of Kingston.<br>
<br>As a poet Tatersal, like his envied rival Duck, is effective when he is depicting his working day, and trite when addressing topics such as &#145;temperance&#146; or in complimentary verses on Richard Onslow, lord lieutenant of Surrey and the dedicatee of the collection. He does, however, display a sense of humour, some awareness of literary works and styles, and a pleasing ability to poke gentle fun at his solitary artisan life.<br>
