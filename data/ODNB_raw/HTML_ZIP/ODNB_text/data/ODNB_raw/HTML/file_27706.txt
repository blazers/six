<span class="headword">Trenchard,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Cato, Diogenes]</span>  (1668/9&#150;1723), <span class="occ">landowner and publicist</span>, was the first son of William Trenchard (1640&#150;1710), landowner, of Cutteridge, Wiltshire, and his wife, Ellen, daughter of Sir George Norton of Abbots Leigh, Somerset. His nonconformist, whig father sat for Westbury in the three exclusion parliaments (1679&#150;81) in which a distant relative, Sir John Trenchard, also sat, representing Taunton. Four decades later that same Somerset borough returned John Trenchard as an independent whig in the general election of 1722. When a student at Trinity College, Dublin&#151;from where he received his first degree on 29 May 1685, aged sixteen&#151;his young tutor, Edward Smith, celebrated &#145;Mr. Trenchard's Talent of Reasoning&#146;, a lastingly esteemed attribute  (<span class="italic">Cato's Letters</span>, preface, xlix). Although a promising young barrister of the Inner Temple, first called to the bar in 1689, his legal career proved brief. With <span class="italic">An Argument Shewing that a Standing Army is Inconsistent with a Free Government</span> (1697) Trenchard initiated, after the treaty of Ryswick, an eventually successful paper war against William III's standing army. In 1699 the House of Commons appointed Trenchard a commissioner of the forfeited Irish lands. When Charles Montagu, then first lord of the Treasury, wanted to take Trenchard into custody for his <span class="italic">Short History of Standing Armies</span> (1698), William refused. Gratitude for financial support from the Trenchard family at the time of the revolution of 1688 probably contributed to the monarch's decision. Trenchard was privileged from his birth into an ancient, landed, west country family, and he fell into &#145;an easy Fortune&#146; from the &#145;Death of an Uncle&#146;, Sir George Norton and from &#145;his Marriage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cato's Letters</span>, preface, xlvii). His first wife may have been the daughter of Sir Thomas Scawen who took her own life in November 1718. The following year, on 19 November 1719, Trenchard married Anne (<i>d</i>. 15 April 1783), daughter of Sir William Blackett, bt.<br>
<br>Although an aggressive anti-clerical polemicist who denied the Trinity, Trenchard defended the &#145;Legal Church&#146; and &#145;was only for pulling down those who would soar above it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cato's Letters</span>, preface, lix). The established church was in his opinion, a necessary institution and&#151;if committed to Christian love&#151;a socially beneficial one. With an eye to social harmony Trenchard also defended the right of private judgement. The twentieth-century editor of his &#145;Essays on miracles&#146; describes Trenchard, a Christian deist, as &#145;an active member of the Anglican Church&#146; throughout his life  (S&eacute;guin, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, i).<br>
<br>Trenchard's popular publications were those he produced in collaboration with Thomas Gordon. At the time of the Bangorian controversy Gordon wrote bitingly witty pamphlets endorsing the radical Erastianism of Benjamin Hoadly that apparently caught Trenchard's eye. Gordon always celebrated Trenchard, his &#145;best Tutor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cato's Letters</span>, preface, 1), and Trenchard's wealth probably underwrote the beginning of what proved to be an unrivalled success in the annals of early journalism. The <span class="italic">Independent Whig</span>, which appeared on Wednesdays from 20 January 1720 and ran for almost a year, censured what Gordon, Trenchard, and a third contributor&#151;perhaps Anthony Collins&#151;considered the ubiquitous and corrupt influence of high-church clerics propagating false divinity from their sacerdotal thrones. From November 1720 until September 1722 Trenchard and Gordon submitted letters, usually under the pseudonym Cato, to the &#145;Author of the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>&#146;. This new weekly paper, founded by Trenchard and whose foreign correspondents he personally paid, had first appeared in August 1719 as the <span class="italic">Thursday's Journal, with a Weekly Letter from Paris</span>, and became a Saturday publication early in 1720. The government, frequently vexed at the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>, finally took it over at the time of the Atterbury conspiracy, just as a letter on standing armies by Trenchard was scheduled to appear. Thereafter, and until &#145;Cato's Farewell&#146; on 27 July 1723, Trenchard and Gordon sent their letters to the &#145;Author of the <span class="italic">British Journal</span>&#146;, the <span class="italic">British Journal</span> being a new weekly that they had started themselves. The Wednesday <span class="italic">Whig</span> and the Saturday missive enjoyed immediate success, and repeated book-form printings of the <span class="italic">Independent Whig</span> and <span class="italic">Cato's Letters</span> during the eighteenth century, speak of an enduring reputation. Readers on both sides of the Atlantic and in the salons of continental <i>philosophes</i> found in these publications resonant rhetoric to sound their own causes. Trenchard and Gordon addressed a contemporary context with a strategically deployed discourse that is confined by any presumed distinction between civic republicanism and liberalism. A contemporary's remark about the use of <span class="italic">Cato's Letters</span> after 1725 as being &#145;equally quoted by the Advocates and Opposers of Sir R. W. [Robert Walpole]&#146; may serve to encourage further reflection on Cato's signifying practices and the variety of reader responses to &#145;his&#146; texts  (Ralph, 505).<br>
<br>The early essays, appearing just after the plummet of South Sea stock, decried the earl of Sunderland's administration with fit charges of malfeasance and urged angry citizens to call for stern retribution. Severe punishment, argued Cato, would vindicate the natural rights that people had first entered into political society to preserve and would confirm government in its proper role as a trust &#145;to watch for the Security, and pursue the Interest of All&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Journal</span>, 90, 15 April 1721). Given their profound pessimism about human nature, Trenchard and Gordon challenged any celebration of disinterested virtue. Cato thus exhorted the people, whose interests had been betrayed, to demand legal revenge while members of parliament, whose interests lay in popular policies, were expected to punish the people's betrayers. But Trenchard and Gordon also feared seditious exploitation of righteous anger. Their exhortations were to some extent a strategic deployment of loyalist, libertarian rhetoric to check Jacobitism. Cato's vivid depictions of absolute monarchy also suggest an effort to channel warranted anger along loyal, legal paths grounded in rights theory, articulated in part to counteract those who, Trenchard and Gordon sincerely believed, claimed a divine right to dominion. Trenchard, especially, called for control over the universities and charity schools, which he considered deeply disaffected institutions in the hands of restless rebels to a free state. The Middlesex grand jury condemned Trenchard's &#145;Of charity, and charity-schools&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal</span>, 39, 15 June 1723) as well as three other Cato letters and Bernard Mandeville's <span class="italic">Fable of the Bees</span> for depicting &#145;religion and virtue as prejudicial to society, and detrimental to the state&#146;  (Gordon, <span class="italic">Cordial</span>, 2.253). The anti-clerical Trenchard did, indeed, deem clericalism a mental tyranny spelling a civil one. The <span class="italic">British Journal</span> had advertised the <span class="italic">Fable</span> and, after Cato's farewell, Gordon and Mandeville published there as Diogenes, a pseudonym that Trenchard used for his more speculative essays. Trenchard only sat in the first session of the second septennial parliament between 1722 and 1723. His brief role there included opposing the suspension of habeas corpus and Walpole's proposal to remit the South Sea Company's debt; a successful motion to impose fines on nonjurors for their presumed sedition; and a vexatious call for attainder against one of the Atterbury conspirators. A well-built but not particularly healthy person, John Trenchard died from a kidney ailment on 16 December 1723 at his residence in Abbots Leigh; the parish church there, where he was buried, holds a monumental Latin inscription to his memory. His three sisters were his heirs. After Trenchard's death, his wife, Anne, married his collaborator, Thomas Gordon.<br>
