<span class="headword">Luxmoore,  John</span>  (1756&#150;1830), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph</span>, was born at Okehampton, Devon, the son of John Luxmoore and his wife, Mary Cunningham. He was educated at Ottery St Mary School and at Eton College, whence he passed as a scholar in 1776 to King's College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1780, and proceeded MA in 1783. On 30 June 1795 he was created DD at Lambeth by Archbishop Moore. He became fellow of his college, having been tutor to the earl of Dalkeith (later the duke of Buccleuch). Backed by the duke's influence, he obtained a series of preferments: he became rector of St George the Martyr, Queen Square, London, in 1782, prebendary of Canterbury in 1793, dean of Gloucester in 1799, and rector of Taynton, Gloucestershire, in 1800. In 1806 he exchanged St George the Martyr for St Andrew's, Holborn. In 1807 he became bishop of Bristol and in 1808 he was translated to Hereford, and in 1815 to St Asaph. In 1808 he resigned the deanery of Gloucester, and in 1815 the benefice of St Andrew's, Holborn. On 6 April 1786 he married Elizabeth Barnard, the niece of Edward Barnard, provost of Eton. The couple had a large family.<br>
<br>Luxmoore published little, other than visitation articles and several sermons. He gained a reputation less for his intellect than as an example of eighteenth-century episcopal avarice. To D. R. Thomas, the historian of St Asaph diocese, Luxmoore was, quite simply, the worst offender in the matter of nepotism and plurality in its annals. He held, as was usual, the archdeaconry of St Asaph at the same time as the bishopric, but also held many other preferments besides. His family, moreover, were treated with similar liberality, and it has been estimated that he and they at one time absorbed as much as &pound;27,000 per annum of church income in the two dioceses of St Asaph and Hereford; even after the bishop's death, his family continued to enjoy &pound;7000 from the diocese of St Asaph alone.<br>
<br>Luxmoore died at the bishop's palace, St Asaph, on 21 January 1830. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_17232"></a><span class="headword">Charles Scott Luxmoore</span>  (1792?&#150;1854), attended Eton College and distinguished himself as a classical scholar while at St John's College, Cambridge, where he completed his degrees with great reputation. He graduated BA in 1815, and proceeded MA in 1818. He married on 10 September 1829 Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1830), the youngest daughter of the Rt Revd Sir John Nicholl.<br>
<br>Following in his father's footsteps, and owing his early advancement to him, Charles Luxmoore became a noted pluralist. Ordained deacon and priest in 1815, he became rector of Bromyard, and also the following year of Cradley and of Darowen, Montgomeryshire. In addition he held a prebend at Hereford from 1819, as well as being at St Asaph the dean (1826&#150;54) and also the chancellor of the diocese. He died at Cradley, Herefordshire, on 27 April 1854. &#145;The death of the Dean of St Asaph removes another gigantic pluralist&#146; noted the <span class="italic">Clerical Journal</span>  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>). He was buried in the cathedral at St Asaph.<br>
