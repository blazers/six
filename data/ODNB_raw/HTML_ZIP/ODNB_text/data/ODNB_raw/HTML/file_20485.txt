<span class="headword">Ua Cerbaill,  M&aacute;el Suthain</span> <span class="st"> [Maolsuthain O'Carroll]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1010), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic</span>, entitled in his obit &#145;chief scholar of Ireland&#146;, was one of the principal supporters of Brian B&oacute;ruma, king successively of D&aacute;l Cais, Munster, and all Ireland. The names of his parents are unrecorded. M&aacute;el Suthain died in Achad De&oacute;, Aghadoe, just to the north of Lough Leane in the west of Munster. This gives some weight to the claim made in a later addition to his obit in the annals of Ulster and in the annals of the four masters that he was also king of the E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in (in the past, the leading dynasty of west Munster). He would thus have been following a tradition, long established in Munster, of combining high ecclesiastical office with kingship. The U&iacute; Cherbaill were one of the kindreds which supplied kings of the E&oacute;ganacht Locha L&eacute;in in the eleventh century, so this addition may be true. M&aacute;el Suthain is, however, best known as the person who made an addition to the <span class="roman">Book of Armagh</span> on behalf of Brian:<blockquote>Saint Patrick, when going to heaven, ordered that the whole fruit of his labour, as well of baptism and of causes as of alms, should be paid to the apostolic city which in Irish is named Ardd Macha. So I have found in the books of the Irish. I, namely Calvus Perennis [the Latinate form of M&aacute;el Suthain], have written in the sight of Brian, emperor of the Irish, and what I have written he has confirmed for all the kings of Cashel. (Kenney, 354)</blockquote>The addition is likely to have been made in 1005, when Brian went on campaign to Armagh and left 20 ounces of gold on Patrick's altar and departed, &#145;taking with him the sureties of the men of Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 1005).<br>
<br>The title here given to Brian echoes the imperial titulature of tenth-century kings of England and may well be a direct imitation. It is uncertain whether Brian had aspirations to extend his supremacy over the <i>Scotti</i> of North Britain, as the choice of &#145;emperor of the Irish&#146; (<i>Scotti</i>) rather than &#145;of Ireland&#146; as his title allows. What is certain is that Brian, by adopting a role as lay patron of Armagh and acknowledging Armagh's rights to revenue in virtue of its status as the apostolic city, effectively another Rome for the Irish, was making a statement which was seen as a corollary of his own status as &#145;emperor of the Irish&#146;. There is a probably contemporary entry in the annals of Ulster (at this date an Armagh chronicle) stating that, in 1014, after Brian had been killed at the battle of Clontarf, the heir of Patrick (that is, the abbot of Armagh) came and removed the bodies of Brian and of his son Murchad to Armagh, buried them in a new tomb (like Christ), and &#145;for twelve nights the community of Patrick waked the bodies in honour of the buried king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 1014, 2). The community of Patrick, for their part, gave Brian exceptional honours.<br>
<br>Although M&aacute;el Suthain Ua Cerbaill accompanied Brian on his major expedition of 1005 to establish his overlordship over Ireland, he was not the most powerful cleric in Munster. That status was reserved for Brian's brother, Marc&aacute;n, son of Cenn&eacute;itig, a pluralist on a grand scale as abbot of Terryglass, Inis Celtra, and Killaloe, and described by one annalist as &#145;head of Munster so far as the clergy are concerned&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicum Scotorum</span>, s.a. 1008, <i>recte</i> 1010). M&aacute;el Suthain was, however, personally close to Brian, if those sources which describe him as his confessor are correct. Moreover, his power in west Munster would have helped to ensure that Brian had no serious opposition in that region. A poem on ecclesiastical and secular rank is attributed to him. He was also remembered in a short late-medieval tale which told how he was saved from hell by three pupils who came back from the dead to inform him that he was currently destined to perdition for three reasons: for the number of personal interpretations of scripture he had invented, for the number of women with whom he had had sex, and for giving up reciting the <span class="italic">Altus prosator</span> attributed to St Columba. He reformed on all three counts and was saved.<br>
<br>M&aacute;el Suthain Ua Cerbaill should be distinguished from a namesake whose death in 1031 is recorded in the annals of Ulster and the annals of the four masters. It remains unclear whether the latter source is correct in saying that this M&aacute;el Suthain Ua Cerbaill, rather than his presumably older contemporary, was confessor to Brian B&oacute;ruma.<br>
