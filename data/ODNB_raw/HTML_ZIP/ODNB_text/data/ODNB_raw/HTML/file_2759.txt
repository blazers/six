<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bodley, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1545&#150;1613), <span class="occ">scholar, diplomat, and founder of the Bodleian Library, Oxford</span>, was born on 2 March 1545 in a house on the corner of High Street and Gandy Street, Exeter, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53707/', "John Bodley (c.1520&#150;1591)")</script>, religious radical and publisher, of Exeter, and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1586), daughter of Robert Hone of Ottery St Mary, Devon. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2758/', "Laurence Bodley (1547/8&#150;1615)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2757/', "Sir Josias Bodley (c.1550&#150;1617)")</script>. The family was related to the Bodleys of Dunscombe.<h2>
<a name="MarianexileandeducationinGeneva15551559"></a>Marian exile and education in Geneva, 1555&#150;1559</h2>Being identified with protestant reform during Mary I's reign, &#145;so cruelly threatned, and so narrowly observed&#146;  (Bodley, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1), John Bodley departed, probably in 1555, to exile in Europe, and was followed by his family. They resided for a short time at Wesel before moving to Frankfurt, where Bodley was involved in the controversy over the prayer book and ritual which split that congregation. When the party led by John Knox moved to Geneva in September 1556, the Bodley family followed, arriving there in May of the following year. With Bodley were his wife, his brother Nicholas, his sons Thomas, Josias, and Laurence, his daughter Prothesia (Prothesy), and three servants. Also in the party was Nicholas Hilliard (1547?&#150;1619), then aged nine, who had been placed with the Bodley family by his father. John Bodley came to occupy an important place in the English congregation at Geneva.<br>
<br>It was in Jean Calvin's Hieropolis, meeting place of English and continental religious and intellectual life, that Thomas Bodley received his early education. He was lodged in the house of Philibert Sarrasin, a French physician and schoolmaster. The curriculum included Latin and Hebrew, and he read Homer with the lexicographer Robert Constantin. Although his name does not appear in the register of students, he followed courses in the Geneva Academy from June 1559, when it was founded, to September, when his family left the city. Thus he is able to describe himself as an &#145;auditor of Chevalerius [Antoine Chevalier] for Hebrew, of Beroaldus [Fran&ccedil;ois B&eacute;rault] in Greek, of Calvin and [Theodore] Beza in Divinity&#146;  (Bodley, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2). After Mary's death, John Bodley returned with his family on 5 September 1559 to London, where he settled and became a freeman of the Drapers' Company later that year.<h2>
<a name="EducationandacademiccareeratOxford15591576"></a>Education and academic career at Oxford, 1559&#150;1576</h2>Thomas Bodley matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1559. He entered as a commoner and was placed under the tuition of Laurence Humphrey, also a Marian exile and leader of the Calvinists at Oxford. He graduated BA in 1563, and in that year was accepted as a probationer fellow of Merton College, being admitted as a fellow in 1564. His academic career was distinguished by the diversity of his talents and interests. Merton led Oxford at this time in teaching beyond the curriculum, and in 1565 Bodley was appointed its first lecturer in Greek. He served three times as bursar, and was also for a time garden-master.<br>
<br>Bodley's interest in Hebrew developed, enabling him to translate inscriptions in college deeds and bringing him into close association with Joannes Drusius in the promotion of Hebrew studies in the college, when the latter resided there between 1572 and 1576. His linguistic versatility is shown further by his contribution to the appendix of Humphrey's <span class="italic">Ioannis Iuelli &hellip; vita &amp; mors</span> (1572) of a Hebrew poem. This poem shows a level of competence in Hebrew that was unusual in Oxford at this time. He also became known outside the college. After taking the MA in 1566 he read natural philosophy in the schools; in 1569 he was elected junior proctor; and for some years he deputized for the public orator, Arthur Atye. In view of his later achievement, the most significant outcome of Bodley's time at Merton was the lifelong friendship established with Sir Henry Savile, who became his principal adviser in the refoundation of the university library.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticcareer15761604"></a>Diplomatic career, 1576&#150;1604</h2>Bodley left Oxford in 1576, for &#145;I waxed desirous to travell beyond the Seas, for attaining to the knowledge of some speciall moderne tongues, and for the encrease of my experience in the managing of affaires&#146;  (Bodley, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 4). In September 1576 he was given leave by the college to travel. Initially, he went to France before spending the next four years in Germany and Italy, achieving proficiency in Italian, French, and Spanish. On his return he continued to reside at Merton, being senior fellow for three years before his resignation in 1586. However, Bodley was frequently absent because he was increasingly involved in state affairs, under the patronage of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary. About 1583 he became a gentleman usher to Elizabeth I and in 1584 was returned as MP for Portsmouth, Hampshire, preferring that seat to Hythe, Kent, which was offered on the recommendation of William Brooke, tenth Baron Cobham, lord warden of the Cinque Ports. In the next parliament he was returned for St Germans, Cornwall. He was not a very active parliamentarian.<br>
<br>During his European travels Bodley became engaged in the foreign affairs which were to be the chief concern of his political career. In October 1579 his presence in Paris was confirmed by the English special ambassador, Edward Stafford, in reply to a letter from Leicester's secretary, Atye. The resident ambassador, Sir Henry Cobham, entrusted to him, because of his knowledge of their language, negotiations with a group of expatriate Italians in July 1580. Bodley's first major diplomatic mission took place from April to July 1585, when he was dispatched by the queen to Denmark and Brunswick. This was a fruitless attempt to bring together Frederick II of Denmark with the duke of Brunswick, William (IV) Hesse-Cassel, landgrave of Hesse, and other adherents of the Augsburg confession, in a conference which was intended to lead to an alliance in favour of Henri of Navarre and the French protestants. In May 1588 he was sent, unaccompanied and bearing letters in Elizabeth's own hand (in which he is described as &#145;confidant et sage et secret&#146;), on a mission to Henri III at the time when the French king was forced to flee from Paris by Henri Guise-Lorraine, prince de Joinville and third duc de Guise  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1588</i>, 611, 629). Bodley claimed that the mission was one of great benefit to the French protestants, and that it contributed to the fall of Guise in September. In August 1588 he was dispatched on an urgent mission to the king of Denmark and the merchants at Hamburg, urging them not to offer assistance to the Spanish Armada  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1588</i>, 225, 229).<br>
<br>Between these missions, Bodley married Ann (1564&#150;1611), daughter of Richard Cary of Bristol, on 19 July 1586. She was the widow of Nicholas Ball, a wealthy fish merchant and mayor of Totnes, Devon. It was largely his wife's fortune, inherited from her father, a wealthy merchant (augmented in 1591 by &pound;1000 inherited from his own father), that laid the foundation of Bodley's subsequent career. They had no children.<br>
<br>Not long after his return from the second embassy to France, Bodley was dispatched upon the most important of his missions, as Elizabeth's ambassador to the United Provinces. His formal status was as one of the two members of the council of state she was entitled to appoint under the treaty of Nonsuch. He was resident at The Hague from December 1588 until early 1597, apart from absences in 1591, when he was granted leave to settle his financial affairs on the death of his father, and again, after the death of his brother Miles, in 1595. On 24 May 1589 a safe conduct was issued for Ann Bodley to take ship to the United Provinces, but it is not clear whether, or for how long, she resided at The Hague.<br>
<br>Bodley's principal instructions concerned Elizabeth's relations with the United Provinces. Among other things he was to ensure their acceptance of a revised treaty; to require them to give military assistance to her campaign against Spain and to pay the expenses of the English auxiliary forces; and above all to repay her considerable loans, largely borrowed at usurious rates from Sir Horatio Palavicino. In the last matter in particular Bodley was perpetually frustrated. Effective power lay not with the council of state but with the states general, its secret committees, and the advocate-general Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, &#145;by whom they are strangely ruled and overruled&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1592</i>, 51). The states, increasingly prosperous in trade, and under the efficient military leadership of Maurice, count of Nassau, saw little reason to bend to Elizabeth's will, and found endless procedural excuses to delay decisions about repayment. This was a principal reason for Bodley's disillusion and eventual demission from an office he found irksome throughout, and in which he often incurred the queen's displeasure. In May 1595 he wrote to Anthony Bacon that &#145;I hear for my comfort, that the Queen on Monday last did wish I had been hanged&#146;  (T. Birch, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth</span>, 2 vols., 1754, 1.244). He asked frequently to be recalled. In October 1592 he wrote to Sir Robert Sidney &#145;I would I were departing together with your Lordship, being wonderfully weary of this Hage, and this Soile, and this paltrie kinde of People&#146;  (A. Collins, ed., <span class="italic">Letters and Memorials of State</span>, 2 vols., 1746, 1.340). He finally returned to England, disillusioned and ill, in 1597, and resigned from all public service. Bodley seemed naturally destined for higher office, but his ambitions were compromised in the rivalry between the Cecil family and Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, each faction seeking to associate the possibility of his preferment to the secretaryship with their own political aims. Eventually his disenchantment with this &#145;throng of Court contentions&#146; led him to take his &#145;full farewell of State imployments&#146;  (Bodley, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 12, 14). His reputation remained high: William Camden gave him much credit for the eventual settlement with the United Provinces. He was proposed in 1598 and 1601 for embassies to France and in 1602 for a resumption of his mission to the United Provinces. In 1604 Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, supported him again for the secretaryship.<h2>
<a name="ThefoundationoftheBodleianLibrary15981613"></a>The foundation of the Bodleian Library, 1598&#150;1613</h2>All these proposals were rejected by Bodley, because by now he was completely immersed in the project which was to occupy the last fifteen years of his life: the restoration of the former university library at Oxford. A celebrated passage in the <span class="italic">Life</span> relates how:<blockquote>I concluded at the last to set up my Staffe at the Library doore in <i>Oxford</i>; being throughly perswaded, that in my solitude and surcease from the Common-wealth affaires, I could not busy my selfe to better purpose, then by reducing that place (which then in every part lay ruined and wast) to the publique use of Students. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 14&#150;15)</blockquote>He felt qualified to carry out this task because of his linguistic and scholarly background, wealth, and influential connections. These qualities are implicit in the letter which he wrote on 23 February 1598 to Thomas Singleton, the vice-chancellor, announcing his momentous offer to restore the library at his own expense and &#145;to stirre up other mens benevolence, to helpe to furnish it with bookes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to the University</span>, 4). After acceptance by convocation of this offer matters moved rapidly. Bodley's letter of 19 March recommended that a delegacy be set up to consider a design which Savile and he would bring before them at Easter. He had already ordered the construction materials, including the timber (a gift from Merton), and arranged for its sawing and seasoning. The shelves were modelled on those in the west wing of Merton College library, which were based on the continental plan introduced for the first time in England in 1589. The delegacy was set up immediately and, since Bodley lived in London, was vital in seeing through the project, as was Savile, who was consulted on all matters of design. In the statutes, which Bodley wrote as early as 1605, and which were accepted by convocation on 12 June 1610, the delegacy was replaced by a body of curators headed by John King, the vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>Refurbishment was well under way by December 1599 when Bodley wrote to Thomas James, the first keeper of the library, that this phase of the operation would be finished within two or three months. The letters to James which followed, throughout the rest of Bodley's life, deal with every aspect of the library: acquisitions; cataloguing and classification; binding; preservation; cleaning; the receiving of visitors. They constitute a manual of library management, and a uniquely detailed account, from its founder's point of view, of the birth of a great library. In June 1602 Bodley wrote to the vice-chancellor that, the construction work being completed, he had begun to busy himself and his friends about &#145;gathering in Bookes&#146;. His flair for public relations and &#145;understanding of the psychology of giving&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 137) ensured that the library was famous from its inception. Already in March 1598 Dudley Carleton reported that &#145;every man bethinks himself how, by some good book or other, he may be written in the scroll of benefactors&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598</i>, 35). And those who were inscribed in the register, which Bodley saw as a vital part of his fund-raising, demonstrate the extent of his network of well-wishers, including leading courtiers, family, and friends. The first gift reported to George Abbot, the vice-chancellor, in June 1600 was the large number of books taken by Essex in 1596 from the episcopal library in Faro.<br>
<br>Several London antiquaries, including Camden and Sir Robert Cotton, were benefactors; these, together with a number of academics, such as Thomas Allen and Thomas James, were important in obtaining many manuscripts alienated from monastic libraries, then beginning to find their way through private collections into public access. Many of the gifts were of money and, together with Bodley's own resources, enabled the founder to pursue an extraordinarily adventurous acquisition policy. In this Bodley exercised his own choices, but depended also on the judgement of the booksellers who worked for him: John Norton, who imported twice yearly from the Frankfurt fair; and his apprentice John Bill, who between 1602 and 1604 made several book-buying excursions to Paris and Frankfurt, to a number of towns in Italy, and even to Seville. Bodley's vision extended beyond European languages, and he built up an impressive collection of Hebrew material, and through benefactors such as Paul Pindar, consul of the Aleppo Merchants, works in or on Syriac, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian. Chinese books, regarded by other collectors as curiosities, were acquired by Bodley as early as 1604.<br>
<br>Bodley insisted that the library should have a respectable collection of books before being opened, and after several delays it was finally inaugurated, in his absence, with about 2000 volumes, on 8 November 1602. It rapidly became internationally renowned. In the first two years of the library's existence twenty-two foreign readers were admitted. It grew rapidly, and a main concern of Bodley's letters was now with the arrangement of the books and with cataloguing. He saw the catalogue as an important feature of the library's first royal visit. James I had already become a patron of the library. On 18 April 1604 he knighted Bodley, and on 20 June issued letters patent granting licence for the library to be endowed with lands in mortmain, declaring that it should be known as &#145;Bibliotheca ex fundatione Thomae Bodley Militis&#146;  (Macray, 31). The king visited the library on 20 August 1605, being presented with a copy of the catalogue. He also made an offer, later rescinded, that Bodley should receive such works as he might select from the royal library. The culmination of Bodley's activities in the acquisition of books came in December 1610 when the Stationers' Company entered into an agreement to supply a free copy of every book registered at Stationers' Hall, ultimately the foundation of legal deposit in Britain. Bodley feared that this source might introduce into the library &#145;idle books, and riffe raffes&#146;, and was anxious about &#145;the harm that the scandal will bring unto the Librarie, when it shalbe given out, that we stuffe it full of baggage books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Thomas James</span>, 219, 222). It was perhaps the prospect of the influx of London books which led to a change in the design of the first extension of the library, already proposed as early as 1609, built between 1610 and 1612. Here, for what has generally been agreed to be the first time in England, is to be found wall shelving with a gallery offering accommodation for the increasing numbers of books of smaller format which could not be chained.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandreputation"></a>Last years and reputation</h2>From the outset Bodley was concerned with sound finance and endowment for the library, which until his death he funded personally. In 1609 he purchased from Francis Norris, second Baron Norris, the manor of Hindon, in the parish of Cookham, Berkshire and tenements in Distaff Lane, London, and in his will bequeathed these to the university, ensuring from the rents annual incomes of &pound;90 10<i>s</i>. and &pound;40 respectively. He was intent on further extension. On 5 November 1611 he wrote to the vice-chancellor outlining an ingenious scheme by which funds might be raised to provide an eastern expansion of the library, which he intended to finance himself. This addition was constructed, as part of the schools quadrangle, under Savile's supervision, after Bodley's death.<br>
<br>Bodley suffered from increasing ill health during his final years. He long suffered from the stone, and John Chamberlain reported in July 1612 that he was now also afflicted with scurvy and dropsy. Although he seems to have recovered sufficiently to visit Oxford, presumably to see the arts end extension, in August, it seems unlikely that he could have left London thereafter, and he died there, at his house adjacent to St Bartholomew's Hospital, on 29 January 1613. Lady Bodley had died in 1611, and had been buried on 12 June in St Bartholomew-the-Less, where she is commemorated by a monument on which her husband wrote of the twenty-four years of their happy married life. He was buried with much ceremony on 29 March in Merton College chapel, having left &pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. for this purpose. Two volumes of commemorative verse were published (<span class="italic">Bodleiomeneme</span>, by members of Merton, and <span class="italic">Iusta funebra Ptolemae Oxoniensis Thomae Bodleii</span>), as well as sermons by John Hales and the public orator, Sir Isaac Wake. His will includes a large number of legacies, amounting to about &pound;1500, to individuals, as well as annual grants to poor people in Oxford and elsewhere. By far the greater part of his fortune was left to the university, and Chamberlain, who computed its value at &pound;7000, recorded the disappointment of many friends and relatives, and complaints of Bodley's being &#145;so drunk with the applause and vanitie of his librarie, that he made no conscience to rob Peter to pay Paul&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1613</i>, 187). The will was indeed contested, by Bodley's brother Laurence and his niece Elizabeth Willis, who were left &pound;200 and &pound;210 respectively, but judgment was given in favour of the executors.<br>
<br>A question open to interpretation is that of Bodley's intention in restoring the library. It was asserted first by Thomas Hearne that &#145;the original design of the library [was] chiefly for books against the Roman Catholicks&#146;  (T. Hearne, <span class="italic">Remarks and Collections</span>, Oxford Historical Society, 11 vols., 1885&#150;1921, 8.262), a view often supported, most recently by D. Trim. However, his coolness towards Thomas James's anti-papist intention in collations of the fathers, his trust in members of Gloucester Hall (then reputedly a home of recusancy), the Catholic connections and sympathies of many of the early donors, and the very universality of the collections argue against so narrow an interpretation.<br>
<br>Any estimate of Bodley's character and motives should take into account his autobiography of 1608, printed in 1647. This has some claim to be considered the first English autobiography in which an author writes &#145;a skilfully structured apologia for his career&#146;  (Wooden, 62&#150;75). Where the record might suggest a largely frustrated diplomatic career, Bodley claimed one of independence and success marred only by faction; where some of his contemporaries saw ambition and vanity, the <span class="italic">Life</span> proposed a disinterested ideal of &#145;duty towards God&#146; exemplified in &#145;the true part of a profitable member of the State&#146;, who &#145;need not be the publisher of the dignity and worth of mine owne Institution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 14&#150;16). His coat of arms incorporates three crowns. The most plausible interpretation of his motto <i>Quarta perennis</i> is that it derives from an aphorism of Rabbi Schimeon in which the three crowns, of learning, priesthood, and kingship, are surpassed by a fourth, congenial to the Renaissance mind, that of a good name. Posterity will doubtless agree that Bodley's breadth of vision and his single-minded assiduity in the use of his talents and fortune have ensured his renown as the greatest benefactor of Oxford University of his time.<br>
