<span class="headword">Harker,  Joseph Cunningham</span>  (1855&#150;1927), <span class="occ">scene painter and theatrical designer</span>, was born on 17 October 1855 in Levenshulme, Lancashire, the third of the three children of William Harker and his wife, Maria O'Connor. When Harker was three years old, his father, a well-known character actor in Manchester, died, and his mother, an actress, toured the provinces to support her children. Although Harker spent these early years performing occasionally in child roles, he showed more interest in scene design, and by the age of twelve he began building and painting his own toy-theatre models. In 1870 he moved to London, where his uncle, John O'Connor, a principal scene painter at the Haymarket Theatre, arranged for him to be apprenticed as a scene painter's assistant at the Globe for Thomas W. Hall, whose daughter, Sarah Elizabeth, Harker married on 10 May 1877. During this period, Harker gained further experience through his occasional work for his uncle at the Haymarket, Albert Callcott at the Alhambra, and Ada Cavendish at the Olympic. In 1874 he ended his apprenticeship, and for the next eight years his freelance work at various London theatres included supervising scenes for <span class="italic">The Ring</span> at Her Majesty's Theatre, painting in its entirety the scenery for <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> at Covent Garden, and painting scenery for George Sanger's pantomimes at Astley's and Augustus Harris's spectacular pantomimes and melodramas at Drury Lane. Harker's many years of freelancing at various studios under the supervision of prominent London scene designers afforded him a breadth of training that greatly enhanced his proficiency in both designing and painting according to different styles and for different genres, ranging from Shakespeare to musical comedy.<br>
<br>After spending six years in Scotland, Dublin, and the United States&#151;where he was employed to paint the backgrounds for large panoramas (open-air pictures) which were very much in vogue&#151;Harker returned to London in 1888 and secured his first significant commission, which paved the way for the development of his professional career. In the autumn of 1888 he was hired to paint several scenes for Henry Irving's Lyceum production of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Shortly afterwards, Irving, who had befriended Harker's father while the two had performed together in Edinburgh, furnished Harker the money to open his own painting studio and offered him work in subsequent Lyceum productions. From 1888 until Irving relinquished management of the Lyceum in 1899, Harker designed and painted dozens of sets for the Lyceum, including scenery for <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, and <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>.<br>
<br>Harker's prestigious position as a principal scenic artist for Irving garnered him other commissions during the 1890s from some of London's prominent theatre managers, including George Alexander at the St James's Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte at the Savoy, and Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket. By 1900 he had secured a reputation as one of the leading scene painters and designers for the British stage. Because he preferred to work as an independent scene artist and not as a stock artist for any one particular house, he received commissions to design scenery from almost every London theatre manager. In addition to providing scenery for more than half of Beerbohm Tree's sixty-odd productions at Her Majesty's Theatre between 1898 and 1917, Harker also designed scenery for Otho Stuart at the Adelphi and the Court, John Vedrenne at the Comedy and the Savoy, George Grossmith at the Shaftesbury and Winter Garden, and George Edwardes at the Gaiety and Daly's. His prolific output as an independent scenic artist was aided by his collaboration with his four sons, who joined the scene studio some time after 1910, and their partnership earned special recognition for their expert designs of oriental settings, including those for <span class="italic">Kismet</span> (1914), <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> (1925), and <span class="italic">Chu-Chin-Chow</span> (1916), the latter regarded by Harker's contemporaries as his finest work. By the time of his death in 1927, his studio (which was later named Harker, Homan, and Bravery Studios Ltd, and continued in business until the 1950s) had provided scenery for most of London's major theatres and managers.<br>
<br>As a master scenic artist of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, Harker, like the other prominent contemporary scene designers with whom he was ranked (Hawes Craven, Walter Hann, and William Telbin), worked according to a scenographic tradition of pictorial realism, which equated the proscenium arch to a frame in which the painted setting represented &#145;real&#146; environments and locales. Applying the principles of realistic scene painting required that Harker depend on visual source material based on direct observations of natural and geographical environments or on research in historical and archaeological facts, but his designs were not merely photographic realism <i>per se</i>, for they were governed by his careful selection and manipulation of compositional details that created stage pictures that served myriad illustrative ends, from showing character psychology to vivifying dramatic atmosphere. Harker, believing in the primacy of the scene painter in creating visual effects, preferred to design and paint sets without three-dimensional pieces, advocating instead the use of drops painted to simulate three-dimensional detail. He excelled particularly in painting realistic exterior settings with vibrant colours and sunlight effects; J. Comyns Carr, recalling Harker's designs, remarked that &#145;the foliage of the trees seems actually to move in the breeze&#146;  (Harker, 198).<br>
<br>Towards the end of Harker's career, the pictorial aesthetic that had long governed his profession and dominated the Victorian and Edwardian theatres was being challenged by the new stagecraft of Poel, Appia, and Craig, who advocated non-illusionistic, non-representational settings. Harker remained a strong proponent of traditional stagecraft, and in 1924, when the new scenography was gaining increasing supporters, he wrote his memoirs, <span class="italic">Studio and Stage</span>, devoting over half of it to criticism of the new stagecraft and a defence of scenic realism and scene painting.<br>
<br>Harker died on 15 April 1927 at his home at 4 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead, and his ashes were interred on 19 April at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
