<span class="headword">Lamberton,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1328), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of St Andrews</span>, came of a family which first settled in Berwickshire, but which held lands in north-east Scotland by the late twelfth century and later in Stirlingshire also. Details of his birth, education, and early career are not certain; he had certainly received a university education by early 1293 and become a canon of Glasgow. By the time of his appearance at King John's first parliament in February 1293 he was chancellor of Glasgow Cathedral. He seems to have been sent abroad for further study by Bishop Robert Wishart of Glasgow, probably in the year or two before July 1295.<br>
<br>In common with most of the Scots nobles and prelates, Lamberton swore fealty to Edward I in 1296 following the English invasion and the deposition of King John. He was also, however, a supporter of the rebellion against the English occupation which culminated in Wallace's victory at Stirling Bridge on 11 September 1297. Shortly before the battle Bishop William Fraser of St Andrews had died in exile, and on 3 November 1297 Lamberton was elected to the vacant see, no doubt with the backing of both William Wallace and his co-leader, Andrew Murray. (Fordun states that it was Lamberton who brought Fraser's heart back to St Andrews for burial, which, if true, may indicate that he was in France at the time of Fraser's death.) Lamberton was consecrated at the curia in June 1298 and used his time there and his journey home through France to further the diplomatic aims of the Scots in their conflict with the English king.<br>
<br>Lamberton returned to Scotland in the summer of 1299 and was immediately embroiled in the difficult political situation. There were extreme tensions within the Scots guardianship which had been elected to rule in the name of the ousted King John&#151;in August that year a dispute between supporters of the two guardians (John Comyn and Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick) ended in a brawl in the council chamber in the presence of an English spy. The dispute was settled by imposing Lamberton as a third, and senior, guardian, an arrangement which lasted for some months. Even after Bruce's resignation from the guardianship Lamberton remained in office, until in October 1300 he and his fellow guardians were replaced by Sir John Soulis, perhaps as sole guardian.<br>
<br>It is possible that Lamberton's demission of office as guardian was designed to allow his participation in further diplomatic efforts abroad. Certainly, for much of 1301 he was out of the country, and may have gone with the important embassy to Rome which was led by the canon lawyer Baldred Bisset. Two of Bisset's companions on the embassy were clerks of Lamberton from the St Andrews diocese, and it seems that preparation of the famous instructions issued to the embassy, and of the <span class="italic">Processus</span> presented by Bisset, may have been influenced by those active in Lamberton's circle, if not by the bishop himself. Whether or not he visited the curia at this time, he was undoubtedly involved in negotiations at the French court in late 1301, attempting to avert the possible signing of an Anglo-French treaty without the inclusion of the Scots. Although he visited France again with a similar mission in 1302&#150;3, his errand was unsuccessful, and the Anglo-French treaty went ahead in May 1303, leaving the Scots diplomatically isolated. Negotiations continued, but in February 1304 most of the Scots nobles submitted to Edward I, one of the conditions of their surrender being that Lamberton and Matthew Crambeth, bishop of Dunkeld, were to be included among those offered the English king's peace. Following his return to Scotland Lamberton swore fealty to Edward in May 1304. The sincerity of his commitment to Edward I must be open to question, since only a few weeks after his submission he entered into a covert bond of friendship with Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick, who was to seize the throne less than two years later. The bond's terms are vague, but must be taken to indicate that Lamberton now accepted that the political future lay with Bruce rather than with King John or his supporters, such as Wallace.<br>
<br>During the period which followed Lamberton seems to have gained the trust of the English king. Late in 1305 he was appointed to be part of Edward's council in Scotland, and indeed led that council by the turn of the year. In September 1305 (less than a month after the execution of Wallace), however, Edward I had issued an ordinance for the government of Scotland, which was, in effect, an act for the incorporation of Scotland in the English dominions. The implications of such an act for the ecclesiastical government of Scotland cannot have endeared it to Lamberton or the other Scottish bishops and, notwithstanding his position of trust, may have incited him to further support and encourage the intended coup by Bruce. When Bruce eventually made his bid for the kingship in March 1306, Lamberton celebrated mass for the new king after the enthronement ceremony, thus placing himself firmly on the side of those backing the new regime and in opposition to the English king. Lamberton was among the &#145;traitors&#146; sought by Edward as early as May 1306, and his men fought for King Robert in the defeat at Methven on 19 June. Lamberton himself was captured by the English soon after the battle, and only his priesthood saved him from execution. He was imprisoned until May 1308, after which, in accordance with a papal demand, he received a conditional release. He was not allowed to return to Scotland until the following year, when he may have been a member of a team negotiating a truce. Later in the same year he represented Bishop Antony (I) Bek of Durham in Scotland, making inquiry into the affairs of the templars, and, remaining there, he was then able to set about restoring the administration of his diocese, which had been severely disrupted by the wars for many years. He seems to have done this with the agreement of the English authorities, even although the work involved much contact with what the latter regarded as the rebel administration of Scotland.<br>
<br>By the early months of 1312, however, Lamberton had once again made it clear that his loyalty lay with the Scottish king and government. He was active as a diplomatic agent for King Robert in the later phases of the war, and was also able effectively to continue the reconstruction of his diocese. In July 1318 a major landmark was reached for both diocese and kingdom: the dedication of the new cathedral of St Andrews, a symbol not only of the restoration of the see, but also of the victory of the national church and kingdom over attempts at subjection from the south.<br>
<br>The position of both national church and government grew stronger, yet in the later years of the reign relations between the Scottish government and the papacy again became strained, resulting in 1319 in the excommunication of the king and his supporters, including Lamberton and other bishops. All the excommunicates ignored their summonses to the curia, and Lamberton continued to act as bishop, politician, and diplomat for some years to come. He was regularly involved in negotiations for truces and for peace, although he was not among those who eventually negotiated the &#145;final&#146; peace with the English. This was agreed upon shortly before Lamberton's death, which took place in St Andrews on 20 May 1328. He was buried in his cathedral on 7 June.<br>
<br>Lamberton's career as Scotland's senior bishop had spanned the entire course of the wars of independence. His allegiance to the &#145;national&#146; cause was not as unwavering as that of some others&#151;in that respect he has sometimes been unfavourably compared with Bishop Wishart of Glasgow&#151;but the political realism which led him to submit to the English power when it was in the ascendant gave him a position from which he was able to influence the path of the kingdom despite the fluctuations of the political, military, and diplomatic struggle. His contribution to the ecclesiastical and political fortunes of the country in that difficult period was therefore immense.<br>
