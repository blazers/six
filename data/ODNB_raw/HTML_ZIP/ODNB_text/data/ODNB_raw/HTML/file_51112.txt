<span class="headword">Solomon,  Saul</span>  (1817&#150;1892), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician in Cape Colony</span>, was born on 25 May 1817 at St Helena, the son of Joseph Solomon, merchant of Solomon, Moss, and Gideon and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> De Mitz. Born into a Jewish merchant family, his parents, in the absence of a synagogue, were married in the island's Anglican church where their children were later baptized, though their liberal dualism meant that the marriage was recorded in the family's Hebrew prayer book and the eldest sons briefly attended a Jewish boarding-school in Ramsgate, Kent. In Cape Town, Solomon's brothers became members of the Congregational church but there is no record of Saul formally joining them even though he was a friend of its leading clergyman and missionary, Dr John Phillip. Nor, though a friend of Cape Town's Jewish minister, did he practise Judaism.<br>
<br>Solomon's liberal political views were respected in Cape Town, even by those opposing them. It was believed in the colony that any legislation he found unacceptable had little prospect of endorsement by the Colonial Office or the Westminster parliament. In practice he was far more radical than either body. Although he read the classical political economists, much history, and the blue books of metropolitan and colonial legislatures, Solomon was as likely to have acquired his beliefs in political representation, personal freedom, and social justice from Cape Town newspapers of the 1830s and 1840s. His influence and standing are best understood in the context of metropolitan and colonial societies of his time.<br>
<br>Solomon's convictions, though they made him a British patriot, did not make him an imperialist. He was often highly critical of the metropolitan government and its representatives in South Africa, and of the majority of settlers. Nevertheless, for thirty years, up to the early 1880s, Solomon was extolled as the colony's pre-eminent parliamentarian. When he rose to speak in the colony's parliament word flew around Cape Town, &#145;Saul is up&#146;, and the public galleries filled  (Solomon, 206). Solomon's eminence was the more remarkable given his physical frailty. He had contracted rheumatic fever and rickets at school in England and his legs had been encased in iron supports which possibly had stunted their growth. This required him to mount a stool in the legislature in order to be seen. Poor health determined that he never held office, and he declined Governor Henry Barkly's 1872 invitation to become the first prime minister of the Cape. Yet, according to W. E. Gladstone Solomon, he &#145;served on every committee, framed nearly every Bill, and virtually led the House on every great occasion&#146;  (Solomon, 71).<br>
<br>The Cape to which Solomon was sent in 1829 was stratified by ethnic, racial, religious, and linguistic distinctions. British settlers were outnumbered by the Dutch and at variance with them. Initially, therefore, crown colony rule, without elected representation, was seen as a way of ensuring that Britain's primary interests, whether economic or strategic, remained paramount. This did not satisfy those under whom Solomon served. His political and commercial apprenticeship began when, aged fourteen, he left school because of his father's straitened circumstances. His seniors wanted greater control over their own affairs; however, although they aspired to representative government, they nevertheless recognized the need to establish a diverse coalition to ensure that when it came, it would not result in British economic and strategic interests being overthrown. Solomon attended the South African College from 1829 to 1831, after which he joined the printer and publisher John Greig; this led to a lifelong association with the colony's liberal and radical journalists, missionaries, and businessmen. In 1834 the <span class="italic">South African Commercial Advertiser</span>, published by his firm, called for &#145;English, Irish, and Scotch mechanics, the Malays, and freed Coloured people of every description &hellip; the English and Foreign merchants &hellip; and the better educated and more liberal portion of the Afrikanders&#146; to unite to &#145;extinguish the last remnant of the high Dutch Oligarchy&#146;  (<span class="italic">South African Commercial Advertiser</span>, 18 Oct 1834). There was no question of power passing out of British hands.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, by the late 1840s Cape Town's British and Dutch middle classes had begun to form a homogeneous capitalist class with the printing and publishing firm of Solomon &amp; Co. as one of its leading members. The consolidated settler middle class had become increasingly resentful of the colony's still unelected legislative council, which was dominated by officials but contained a minority of nominated members drawn from an older, more entrep&ocirc;t-orientated British mercantile class who shared government patronage with a small cabal of officials surrounding the Cape's colonial secretary, John Montague. Montague's opponents saw this as undermining the colony's probity and consequently its creditworthiness in the City of London. Opposition became a mechanism for intensifying the colony's social and constitutional crisis, threatening stability and helping to advance the milieu which proved so conducive to Solomon's liberal political philosophy. In addition, the destabilizing effects of the colonial government's frontier policy gave cause for alarm, being seen as provocative of external wars with the independent Xhosa and of disaffection among the increasingly creolized Khoisan. Thereafter, the refusal of colonial militias to serve in the 1847 Cape Frontier War meant the maintenance of an expensive metropolitan army at the Cape. Colonial apprehension about this army, when combined with the anti-convict movement, encouraged a territory-wide coalition crossing ethnicity, class, and race. A leading Cape Afrikaner called for unity between &#145;Africanders of Dutch, French, German, English, Danish, Portuguese, Mozambiquan, Malay, and Hottentot extraction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cape Town Mail</span>, 16 April 1852).<br>
<br>The coalition fell short of threatening revolution, but ultimately persuaded the colonial administration that representative institutions would be the cheapest way to restore consent for British rule. In this political climate, Saul Solomon made his address to the Cape Town electors: &#145;I shall consider it a sacred duty&#146;, he told them, &#145;to give my decided opposition to all legislation tending to introduce distinctions either of class, colour or creed&#146;  (Solomon, 22). The coalition broke up, but Solomon's liberal opinions continued to gain respect long after it ceased to dominate Cape politics. His reforming zeal incorporated the advocacy of the abolition of state aid to the two privileged Christian churches and promotion of the economic and political rights of women. He endorsed a proposal for suffrage in 1870 and established a workshop for women printers, bringing a qualified craftswoman to the Cape to instruct white and coloured women apprentices. Confronting considerable opposition, in and out of parliament, he persuaded fellow legislators to repeal a <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span>, writing to Josephine Butler, his great admirer, that the act practised, &#145;injustice to an outcast class&#146;, created a system of &#145;police espionage&#146;, and was &#145;pernicious and degrading&#146; to the &#145;unhappy women who came under its operation&#146;  (Butler, 67&#150;8). On 21 March 1874 he married Georgiana Margaret Thomson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56252/', "Solomon, Georgiana Margaret (1844&#150;1933)")</script>], a schoolteacher and afterwards headmistress of advanced feminist views.<br>
<br>Although he did not question the initial colonization of the Cape, Solomon opposed almost any extension of its existing borders, believing that this must lead to an arbitrary and despotic system for the control of the populations brought under the colonial state. When African peoples suffered from the capricious rule of colonists or administrators, he used the legislative assembly to denounce such actions. He opposed the illegal trial of Chief Langalibalele and attacked British policy in Natal and the Transvaal. He was, nevertheless, one of the earliest proponents of a South African federation.<br>
<br>While unable to determine the programme of the Cape parliament, Solomon was perceived as an arbiter of what was acceptable to the Colonial Office and the British parliament. Visiting the Cape in 1878, Anthony Trollope claimed that, &#145;it would have been nearly impossible to pass any measure of importance through the Cape parliament to which he offered a strenuous opposition&#146;  (Trollope, 95). This was borne out in 1881 when Solomon led the successful opposition to Cecil Rhodes's attempt to introduce flogging into a bill aimed at curbing illegal diamond sales. Rhodes acknowledged Solomon's eminence in seeking to make him, along with General Gordon and himself, members of a three-man commission to determine the fate of Basutoland.<br>
<br>Yet times were changing. In the late 1870s, as the diamond fields began to transform the economic potential of South Africa, settlers and the imperial government became increasingly bent on expansionist policies determined to break the independence of the chiefdoms. Solomon and his newspaper the <span class="italic">Cape Argus</span> were extremely critical of the wars and atrocities which followed. The Cape ministry, largely supported by eastern Cape British settlers, became hostile to Solomon, causing him to lose the government printing contract and to suffer a drastic decline in his commercial well-being. Financial disaster was followed by personal tragedy when a child was drowned. His health deteriorated and he withdrew from parliament, retiring to Kilcreggan, Scotland, where he died on 16 October 1892. His widow afterwards became an important campaigner for women's rights in South Africa and a suffragette who went to prison in England.<br>
