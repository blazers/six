<span class="headword">Kerr <span class="st"> [Ker]</span>,  Robert</span>, first marquess of Lothian  (1636&#150;1703), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born at Newbattle House, Edinburghshire, on 8 March 1636, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15468/', "William Kerr, third earl of Lothian (c.1605&#150;1675)")</script>, and Anne Kerr (<i>d</i>. 1677), daughter of Robert Ker, second earl of Lothian, and countess of Lothian in her own right. Styled Lord Kerr of Newbattle, he was educated at the University of Leiden (1651&#150;3), and at Saumur, Angers, and Paris (1654&#150;7). In January or February 1660 he married Lady Jean (<i>d</i>. 1700), daughter of Archibald Campbell, marquess of Argyll. His father resigned the estates in his favour in 1665. He helped to keep law and order in the borders, commanding a troop of horse from 1668 to 1676, and perhaps volunteered in the Third Anglo-Dutch War before a secret visit to Paris in September 1673. He succeeded to his father's titles in October 1675.<br>
<br>Poor health took Lothian to Paris and Montpellier from autumn 1679 until summer 1680. Taking the test in 1681, he was briefly a privy councillor from 4 January 1686 until purged with other opponents of the repeal of the penal laws on 16 September. He supported the revolution of 1688 and was appointed a privy councillor on 18 May 1689, and justice-general and sheriff-principal of the shire of Edinburgh on 3 August, as well as serving as a Treasury auditor and in other minor posts until his death. In 1690 he succeeded his uncle Charles as earl of Ancram.<br>
<br>A moderate presbyterian, perhaps influenced by Bishop Robert Leighton, a former minister of Newbattle, Lothian was appointed high commissioner to the general assembly sitting in January 1692, charged with implementing the king's recommendation that the assembly admit episcopal ministers into the kirk who were prepared to accept the confession of faith and submit to the authority of the presbyterian church courts. The presbyterians accepted reports that the king would not press the matter against their unanimous opposition, a belief strengthened by Lothian's moderate tone and his faithfulness in keeping the king's instructions secret. For a month the assembly stalled by attending to routine business, and considered a few episcopalian addresses only at the commissioner's request. Lothian astounded the clergy when on 13 February 1692 he admonished them for failing to unite with their brethren, and as instructed suddenly dissolved the assembly without the usual appointment of another date. Despite Lothian's protests the moderator appointed a date in August 1693, but a constitutional crisis was avoided because an assembly was not held on that date. Partly blamed for the failure of the king's policy, and again beset by ill health, which drove him to Bath in 1693, Lothian consoled himself with his stringed instruments and by improving his house at Newbattle. Having long struggled to maintain the precedence of his title, in 1695 he was humiliated by a parliamentary vote ranking him below other earls, but on 23 June 1701 his support for the court was rewarded with the title of marquess of Lothian. Appointed a commissioner for the Union with England on 25 August 1702, and a privy councillor and commissioner of exchequer on 4&#150;5 February 1703, he died suddenly at London on 15 February, aged sixty-six. A post-mortem examination revealed a diseased gall bladder and the effects of &#145;whooring and the clap&#146;  (Walter Scott to Robert Scott, 26 Feb 1703, NL Scot., MS 594, no. 2174). He was buried in the family vault at Newbattle parish church.<br>
<br>Lothian's movable estate, including unpaid salary and his investments in the Darien Company, amounted to &pound;15,213 13<i>s</i>. Scots. Of his six sons and five daughters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15469/', "William Kerr, second marquess of Lothian")</script>, became a soldier. A younger son, <a name="cosubject_15463"></a><span class="headword">Lord Mark Kerr</span>  (1676&#150;1752), also an <span class="occ">army officer</span>, became a captain on 8 June 1693, and was wounded at Almanza on 25 April 1707. A brigadier-general at the capture of Vigo in 1719, he was appointed governor of Guernsey in 1740 and promoted general in 1743. When governor of Berwick upon Tweed in 1745, his reported quip to Sir John Cope, fleeing the Jacobite forces at Prestonpans, that he was the first general to have broken the news of his own defeat, was recorded in the contemporary ballad &#145;Johnnie Cope&#146;. That year he became governor of Edinburgh Castle. He died, unmarried, in London, on 2 February 1752, and was buried four days later in Kensington.<br>
