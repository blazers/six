<span class="headword">Butterworth,  John Blackstock <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>, Baron Butterworth  (1918&#150;2003), <span class="occ">university administrator</span>, was born on 13 March 1918 at Lyndhurst, Station Road, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, the son of John William Butterworth (<i>d</i>. 1939), railway goods clerk, and later a manager for the London and North Eastern Railway, and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blackstock, schoolteacher. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Mansfield, and then at Queen's College, Oxford, to which he had won an open scholarship. He graduated with a first-class degree in jurisprudence in 1938. He then went to the chambers of Geoffrey Cross. On the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the Royal Artillery. After gunnery training he spent most of the war based on the island of Hoy in the Orkneys, protecting the naval base at Scapa Flow. On demobilization in 1946 he returned to the chambers of Geoffrey Cross, but moved back the same year to Oxford as fellow and tutor in law at New College; he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1947. On 30 April 1948 he married Doris Crawford Elder, the 22-year-old daughter of George W. Elder, businessman, of Skegby, Nottinghamshire. They had two daughters, Anna (<i>b</i>. 1951) and Laura (<i>b</i>. 1959), and a son, John (<i>b</i>. 1952).<br>
<br>As a fellow of New College from 1946 to 1963 Butterworth was a superb tutor, whose students achieved excellent results. He published relatively little, but attained a reputation as an authority on administrative law. He played a full part in college and university life. He was dean (1952&#150;6), bursar (1956&#150;63), and sub-warden (1957&#150;8) of New College, and as bursar oversaw a successful appeal that raised some &pound;250,000 for the college. He served on the university's hebdomadal council from 1953 to 1963, taking a particular interest in the university's financial affairs, on which he became chief spokesman.<br>
<br>In 1963 Butterworth became founding vice-chancellor of the University of Warwick, one of a number of new universities created in the early 1960s. (He had also been offered the vice-chancellorship of the new University of Lancaster.) At the time of his appointment the university consisted of no more than a greenfield site at Gibbet Hill on the outskirts of Coventry (the name Warwick had been chosen in order to attract support from the county notables of Warwickshire), but with the aid of modern industrial building techniques it was able to admit graduate students from 1964, and undergraduates from the following year. Perhaps the most striking aspect of Butterworth's vision for the new university was his insistence that teaching should go hand in hand with leading-edge research (an idea which would later become commonplace, but which at the time was unusual), thus establishing from the outset Warwick's vocation as a centre of academic excellence. Though in many other respects a forceful and &#145;hands-on&#146; vice-chancellor, he devolved considerable responsibility to his founding professors, enabling them to develop their departments and curricula with minimal interference beyond the necessary budgetary constraints. It was widely acknowledged that he was an excellent judge of academic talent, and many of his appointments went on to become internationally renowned experts in their own fields.<br>
<br>The original bid for the new university had come from a consortium of Coventry industrialists, trade unionists, and city councillors, keen to address the economic decline of the city and region, and another striking (and prescient) aspect of Butterworth's vice-chancellorship was his emphasis on forging links with industry and the local community. When the University Grants Committee (UGC) baulked at the creation of an engineering department (on the grounds that engineering was already well catered for at other universities) he orchestrated a protest from local industrialists which eventually overcame the UGC's objections. When it refused funding for a business school, with the help of Lord Rootes (chairman of the local promotion committee) he raised the funds privately. The university's close association with local industry led to an embarrassing episode in 1970 when students who had occupied the university registry in pursuit of their demands for a student union building discovered correspondence that they claimed implicated Butterworth and local firms (notably Rootes) in political vetting and surveillance of students and lecturers. Despite a court injunction the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span> published a selection of the correspondence, E. P. Thompson (a Marxist historian then teaching at the university) edited a scathing attack on the university for its alleged subservience to local industry (<span class="italic">Warwick University Limited</span>, 1970), and the staff passed a motion of no confidence in the vice-chancellor. Butterworth kept his cool, the furore eventually died down, and the university continued on the path on which Butterworth had set it. Among the most notable achievements of his latter years as vice-chancellor were the creation in the early 1980s of the Warwick Manufacturing Group under Kumar Bhattacharyya (which by the time of Butterworth's death had an annual turnover of over &pound;100 million), and of the Warwick Science Park (Butterworth again finding himself attacked by student radicals after inviting the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, to open it in 1984). The achievement of which he was proudest, however, was the building of the Warwick Arts Centre, an innovatory complex at the heart of the campus, housing theatres, a concert hall, a cinema, and an art gallery, all open to the public, and built entirely with private funding. The centre's 1500-seat concert hall was named the Butterworth Hall in honour of his role in its creation in 1987, two years after his retirement as vice-chancellor. By the time of his retirement Warwick was without doubt the most successful of the new universities, with more than 1000 graduate and 4600 undergraduate students, an annual income of &pound;36.1 million (only 59 per cent of which came from the UGC), and a research base which surpassed that of most of the older universities.<br>
<br>Throughout his time at Warwick Butterworth was active in public and educational bodies, most notably as a managing trustee of the Nuffield Foundation (1964&#150;85), chairman of the Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas (1968&#150;77), and a board member of the British Council (1981&#150;95). He was a member of the royal commission on the working of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act (1921) in 1966, and in 1971&#150;3 chaired a government inquiry into the work of probation officers and social workers. From 1964 to 1999 he was a governor of the Royal Shakespeare Trust. He was also a magistrate in Oxford and then Coventry. He was appointed CBE in 1982 and on retirement from Warwick in 1985 was made a life peer, as Baron Butterworth, of Warwick. Unusually for a former vice-chancellor he chose a party affiliation, as a Conservative. He spoke relatively rarely in the chamber, but he was an active member of the select committees on science and technology and on the European Communities. He also chaired the Foundation for Science and Technology (1990&#150;97).<br>
<br>A forceful, ebullient man, with a booming voice and a keen sense of humour, Butterworth was known in Oxford and Warwick as Jolly Jack. He was supported throughout his career by his wife, Doris, to whom he was devoted. He remained active to the end, despite the onset of lung cancer. He died of heart failure on 19 June 2003 at the General Hospital, Cheltenham, having lived latterly at Barton, near Guiting Power, Gloucestershire. He was survived by his wife and their three children. A memorial service was held at Lincoln's Inn chapel on 24 November 2003.<br>
