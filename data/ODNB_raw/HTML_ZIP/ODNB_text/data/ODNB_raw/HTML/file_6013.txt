<span class="headword">Colvin,  John Russell</span>  (1807&#150;1857), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, second son and fourth child of James Colvin, of the mercantile house of Colvin, Bazett &amp; Co. of London and Calcutta, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson, was born in Calcutta on 29 May 1807. He was educated at St Andrews University (1819&#150;21), and, after a short time with a tutor in Hampstead, highly distinguished himself as a student at the East India College, Haileybury, where he won eleven prizes and was ranked first in the leaving class of 1825. In that year he went to Bengal as a writer, and spent a year studying the principal Indian languages at Fort William College, Calcutta.<br>
<br>Colvin's first appointment, in September 1826, was as an assistant in the <i>sadr</i> (chief) civil and criminal court in Calcutta. The following year he was appointed second assistant to the resident at Hyderabad; serving there essentially as a collector, he became conversant with land revenue questions. In January 1831 he became an assistant secretary to the judicial and revenue departments in Calcutta, and in March 1835 he became secretary of the <i>sadr</i> board of revenue, Lower Provinces. This post was something of a plum, and carried a significant salary. It also brought him to the attention of the governor-general, Lord Auckland, and in 1836 he became Auckland's private secretary, a post he held for six years. Colvin had Auckland's entire confidence, and in consequence has often been held responsible for leading Auckland into his disastrous involvement in Afghanistan; however, the driving force behind the policy to prop up Shah Shuja at Kabul in place of Dost Muhammad was actually Sir William Hay Macnaghten, Auckland's chief secretary for foreign affairs. When Auckland retired in 1841 Colvin took a three-year furlough. He had earlier married Emma Sophia, daughter of Wetenhall Sneyd, vicar of Newchurch, Isle of Wight; with her he had ten children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32516/', "Sir Auckland Colvin")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1845 Colvin was appointed resident at the court of Nepal, and in 1846 commissioner of the eastern Tenasserim provinces. In 1849 he was promoted to the <i>sadr</i> court, where he showed remarkable judicial acumen, despite his lack of formal legal training. He succeeded his friend James Thomason as lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces in 1853. Considered an able and active administrator, his seniority assured his promotion. In this office he showed great mastery of the details of government, and learned much from his collectors on cold weather tours. All departments, including criminal justice and police, came under his purview, as well as the application of the revenue system to the previously unsettled Saugor and Nerbudda territories. He also promoted road building, and under his rule the Ganges Canal was completed. Colvin presided over the grand opening of the canal in 1854. He pursued the scheme of primary education introduced by Thomason until Charles Wood's education dispatch of 1854. It was sometimes said that he over-governed, concerning himself with minute details and overburdening his secretaries.<br>
<br>When the Indian mutiny broke out in May 1857 Colvin appeared to be in a very perilous position. Unlike John Lawrence in the Punjab, Colvin had no warning of the insurrection; when he heard that the rebels had taken Delhi, he acted promptly and vigorously. He held a parade of the troops, at which he tried to calm their fears, and on 24 May he offered a pardon to all soldiers under his jurisdiction who had been involved in the disturbances, provided they had committed no serious crimes. This proclamation was disavowed by Lord Canning, the governor-general, and despite an able defence of his position, Colvin had to modify his terms. On 1 June he disarmed the two Indian regiments at Agra, and replaced them with volunteer forces to protect the city. He strengthened the fort and made arrangements for the reception within its walls of the entire Christian population of the cantonment and city (about 6000 people), including the Christian village of printers that had been organized by the Church Missionary Society at nearby Sikandra. An indecisive skirmish with the now mutinous regiments on 5 July ended with the retreat of the British forces into the fort just as their opponents had exhausted their ammunition and were on the point of retiring. Much criticized for his handling of the affair, Colvin suffered his first collapse immediately before his entry into the fort. He was transferred to the cantonments, where he died on 9 September 1857; he was buried in the fort the next day. His collapse and eventual death appear to have been caused by physical and nervous exhaustion. Announcing Colvin's death, Canning described him as &#145;one of the most distinguished among the servants of the East India Company&#146; and praised his &#145;ripe experience, his high ability, and his untiring energy&#146;.<br>
