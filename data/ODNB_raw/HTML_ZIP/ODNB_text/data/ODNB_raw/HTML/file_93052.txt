<span class="headword">Roberts <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Weir]</span>, Dame  Jean Barr McDonald</span>  (1895&#150;1988), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born at 36 Avenue Road, Springburn, Glasgow, on 20 December 1895, the daughter of Walter Weir (1867&#150;1926), foreman locomotive engine fitter, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nevin (1871&#150;1919), both of whom were Glasgow-born. Springburn was an industrial district dominated by extensive railway workshops; its largest trading concern was the Cowlairs Co-operative Society, founded by railway workers in 1881. Jean's father was strongly influenced by the co-operative ethos, which led him into socialism and support of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). She, in turn, absorbed her father's politics.<br>
<br>Jean Weir attended Albert School, Springburn, and then Whitehill School, Dennistoun, the most successful higher-grade institution run by Glasgow school board. She was an able scholar but her parents decided against sending her to university, because of the cost and the likelihood that she would eventually marry. Instead, in 1914, she enrolled at Dundas Vale Teacher Training College, Glasgow. She qualified as a primary school teacher in 1916 and worked in Bishop Street elementary school and then in a special school for children with disabilities. On 1 July 1922 she married Cameron Roberts (1889&#150;1964), son of William Roberts, life assurance agent. Her husband, a mathematics teacher, later became headmaster of Albert senior secondary school in Springburn. The couple had one daughter.<br>
<br>Scottish women teachers in state education faced a marriage bar, which meant that Jean Roberts had to leave the profession in 1922. However, she used other outlets for her teaching skills, notably as a lecturer with the co-operative movement. Along with her husband she was also prominent in the ILP and in 1929 stood as a town councillor for the Kingston ward of Glasgow corporation. Although her own religious background was presbyterian, she appealed to Catholic voters, who were a significant element of the electorate: she had previously spoken out against ILP support for birth control, claiming that the issue was politically divisive, and she backed the continuing maintenance of denominational schools under the terms of the 1918 <span class="roman">Education (Scotland) Act</span>. Although elected by only a narrow margin in November 1929, she was never thereafter seriously challenged in the Kingston ward, and served uninterrupted as a councillor until 1966.<br>
<br>In 1933 the Labour group won a majority on the corporation for the first time, as a result of mainstream Labour councillors collaborating with eleven ILP members to take control from the ruling anti-socialist coalition. Roberts, whose politics were orthodox Labour, became a bailie (magistrate) in 1934. Two years later she was the first Labour woman to serve as senior magistrate, effectively as deputy for the lord provost. Labour's electoral grip on Glasgow was consolidated after 1933, until the Conservative-dominated Progressive group briefly gained power in 1949. Roberts's committee record suggests that she was a reliable representative with a good grasp of administration.<br>
<br>In May 1952, when the Labour Party regained control of the corporation, Roberts was elected city treasurer, a prestigious responsibility, that had never previously been undertaken by a woman. After facing an onslaught from the political opposition against Glasgow's high level of public expenditure to fund an intensive programme of school- and house-building, she countered her critics by limiting rate increases and calling on the Conservative government to re-examine the local taxation system, on the basis that Scotland was receiving unfavourable treatment through the exchequer equalization grant. Her most memorable recollection of her three years as treasurer was of being received in the headquarters of the Bank of England, as the first woman to go there in an important official capacity  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 5 May 1960).<br>
<br>A term as city treasurer was regarded as a direct stepping-stone to becoming lord provost of the city, but although Roberts was nominated in 1955, and again in 1958, the Labour group chose men to fill the office. She was eventually successful in May 1960, and her election received considerable publicity. Roberts was not only Glasgow's first woman lord provost, she was also the first in Scotland, and there were consequently questions of protocol to be addressed. The title of lord provost had masculine connotations, although Roberts determinedly retained the traditional designation, as well as that of lord lieutenant of the county of the city of Glasgow. Certain conventions came to be viewed in a new light with a woman in office, notably attendance at all-male functions, such as the annual dinner of Glasgow's trade incorporations. Roberts said that she broke the tradition to maintain the tradition that the lord provost should always represent the city on such occasions  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 18 May 1962).<br>
<br>Roberts's three-year term as civic leader coincided with major changes in Glasgow's urban landscape, as many of the older communities were cleared and redeveloped under the corporation's ambitious planning programme. Yet Roberts had mixed reactions to Glasgow's structural regeneration and she was ahead of her time in arguing for the conservation of architecturally distinguished buildings. She also expressed strong reservations about multi-storey apartment blocks and saw new towns as a healthier solution to Glasgow's overcrowding problems. She was a vocal champion of public transport: an official corporation visit to the United States in 1961 convinced her of the need to restrict the use of private motor vehicles in urban centres.<br>
<br>Physically a small woman, Roberts described herself in a <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> interview as &#145;no mannequin&#146;  (18 May 1962), but she was conscious of her appearance and cultivated a look of sober stylishness. She also had a reputation of being &#145;teacherly&#146; in her demeanour, abhorring stereotypical images of the city as hard-drinking, violent, and uncouth. She ardently promoted its cultural assets, especially classical music. From 1952 she was a director of the Glasgow-based Scottish National Orchestra and served as its chairman from 1970 to 1975. She was also a member of the Scottish Arts Council and the Arts Council of Great Britain. After her retirement from municipal politics in 1966 she remained active in public affairs, notably as chairman of Cumbernauld New Town Development Corporation up to 1972. In June 1962 she was made a dame commander in the Order of the British Empire and on 22 June 1977 she was made an honorary LLD by Glasgow University.<br>
<br>Roberts was regarded as politically cautious, but her efforts to reconcile the traditional elements of the provostship with her socialism and gender meant that she had to make compromises. In her pronouncements she avoided identification with any particular wing of the Labour Party, although her stance over the years indicated loyalty to the national leadership. Her abilities were concentrated in the sphere of municipal rather than parliamentary politics and she unquestionably enhanced the status of women in Scottish local government. Glaswegians still remembered her name long after she ceased to be lord provost. Roberts died on 26 March 1988 at Gartnavel Royal Hospital, 1055 Great Western Road, Glasgow, of a pulmonary-related illness. She was cremated at Maryhill crematorium, Glasgow, on 31 March 1988. She did not live to see the election of the city's second female lord provost, Susan Baird, in May 1988.<br>
