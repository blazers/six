<span class="headword">Yonge, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1405&#150;1477), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the eldest son of a Welshman, Thomas Yonge, or Mere (<i>d</i>. 1427), who was mayor of Bristol in 1411&#150;12 and 1420&#150;21, and represented Bristol in parliament in 1414; his mother was Joan Wotton (<i>d</i>. 1429), widow of the wealthy Bristol merchant John Canynges. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4581/', "William Canynges")</script> was thus his half-brother. His younger brother, John Yonge, became a prominent London grocer, representing the city in parliament (1455&#150;6) as well as being sheriff in 1455&#150;6 and mayor in 1466&#150;7. Having become a consistent Yorkist, he was knighted by Edward IV after his restoration to the throne, on 20 May 1471.<br>
<br>Thomas Yonge became a member of the Middle Temple, and built up a practice in Bristol and the south-west of England as well as in London. He was recorder of Bristol by 1441, serving until at least 1462, and he was one of the city's MPs in 1435, 1437, 1439&#150;40, 1442, 1445&#150;6, 1447, 1449, 1449&#150;50, 1450&#150;51, and 1455&#150;6. It may be significant that as late as 1455 the election returns refer to him as <i>mercator</i> (merchant): for much of his career he seems to have had strong links with the commercial worlds of Bristol and London.<br>
<br>In June 1451 Yonge presented in parliament a petition from his constituents to the effect that the duke of York should be recognized as heir presumptive to the throne. This was part of a wider attack upon the duke of Somerset, whose position was, however, unshaken; parliament was dissolved, and Yonge was committed to the Tower of London. He was released in April 1452, on the general pardon issued after the temporary reconciliation of the two parties. Back in parliament in January 1456 he claimed redress for his arrest and imprisonment, reminding the Commons in his petition that all members:<blockquote>ought to have their freedom to speak and say in the house of their assembly as to them is thought convenient or reasonable without any manner of challenge, charge, or punition therefore to be laid to them in any wise. (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 5.337)</blockquote>The Commons sent up the bill to the Lords, and the king ordered that the lords of the council should provide a remedy; but no further proceedings in the matter are recorded.<br>
<br>Yonge was not elected to the strongly royalist parliament that met at Coventry in November 1459, but he was returned for Gloucestershire in 1460 to the parliament that reversed the proceedings at Coventry. It is nevertheless unclear how far he can be called a Yorkist at this time. In 1446 he was retained as legal counsel by Humphrey Stafford, duke of Buckingham, and he continued to serve the duke until at least 1457&#150;8.<br>
<br>In 1442 Yonge obtained a writ exempting him from appointment as serjeant-at-law, and it was only on 7 November 1463 that he was finally appointed, the day before he was made a king's serjeant. He is described shortly after his appointment as &#145;arrayed yn a long blue gown ungurd, with a scarlet hode unrolled and j [one] standyng roon [round?] cap of scarlet, as the custom is of sergeantes to go&#146;  (B. R. Masters and E. Ralph, eds., <span class="italic">Church Book of St Ewen's, Bristol, 1454&#150;1584</span>, Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, Records Section, 5, 1967, 58). In November 1467 he was raised to the bench as justice of the common pleas. He was not, however, removed when Henry VI was restored in October 1470, but lost his position&#151;perhaps on the grounds of age&#151;during the rearrangement of the judiciary when Edward IV regained his throne six months later; he was, however, exempted from the operation of the <span class="roman">Act of Resumption</span> of 1472&#150;3. Nevertheless, on 29 April 1475, in spite of his advanced age, Yonge was appointed a justice of the king's bench, possibly as a measure to strengthen the latter court during Edward IV's expedition to France of that year.<br>
<br>He was married, by 1454, to Isabel, daughter of John Burton, a prosperous Bristol merchant. He died on 3 or 4 May 1477 and was buried in the Greyfriars Church, London; his heir was his son Thomas, said to be aged thirty or more, and he also had another son and three daughters.<br>
