</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawes, Sir  William</span>, third baronet  (1671&#150;1724), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was born on 12 September 1671 at Lyons, near Braintree, Essex, the third and youngest son of Sir John Dawes, first baronet (<i>bap</i>. 1644, <i>d</i>. 1671), and Christian, daughter and heir of William Lyons of Lyons. He entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 11 September 1680; he became a good classical scholar and &#145;a tolerable master of the Hebrew tongue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whole Works</span>, viii), and produced as his first work a poem, <span class="italic">The Anatomy of Atheisme</span>. He was elected a scholar of St John's College, Oxford, on 1 July 1687 and seemed destined for the church. He was not deflected from this course, despite becoming heir to the family baronetcy in 1690, following the deaths of his two elder brothers. He migrated from Oxford to Cambridge and entered St Catharine's College as a nobleman in 1689, occupying his eldest brother's former chambers. His next work was devotional in character, <span class="italic">The Duties of the Closet</span>. Since he was still too young for the ministry he visited his estates and other parts of the kingdom. He married on 1 December 1692, at St Edmund the King, Lombard Street, London, Frances (<i>c</i>.1676&#150;1705), eldest daughter of Sir Thomas D'Arcy, first baronet, of Branstead Lodge, Essex. They had five sons and two daughters, of whom only one son and one daughter survived. Dawes was made a fellow and MA of St Catharine's in 1695, received a DD by royal mandate in 1696, was elected master of the college in 1697 (a post that he retained until 1714), and was made vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1698. In 1697 he had been appointed a chaplain to William III, who, following a sermon on 5 November 1697, appointed him &#145;by way of pledge of his future favour&#146; to a prebend in Worcester Cathedral, to which he was instituted on 26 August 1698 and which he retained until 1708. On 10 November he was appointed rector, and from 19 December dean, of Bocking, in the neighbourhood of the Dawes estates.<br>
<br>With the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 Dawes was appointed one of her chaplains. He was a renowned preacher, Bishop Nicolson describing one of his sermons, at St James's in November 1702, as &#145;an excellent discourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries</span>, 126). Another bold sermon, preached on 30 January 1705, was reputed to have cost Dawes the bishopric of Lincoln, which went instead to William Wake, but he affected to be unmoved by this, saying that &#145;he had no manner of concern upon him, because his intention was never to gain one by preaching&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whole Works</span>, xxx). Preferment came in controversial circumstances in 1707&#150;8, following a political struggle in which the queen's determination to appoint him to the see of Chester was threatened by whig pressure on the Godolphin ministry to ensure that candidates for the episcopal bench were more amenable to the whig party line. Though offered the bishopric in April 1707 his appointment was not announced until 6 January 1708; he was consecrated on 8 February by his great supporter and patron John Sharp, archbishop of York.<br>
<br>Dawes was active as a bishop in both pastoral and political matters. He was in Cheshire in the summer of 1708, meeting the notables of his diocese. At dinner with Sir Henry Bunbury on 1 June 1708 he was &#145;provoked to full discourse on the Prince of Wales [he] is clear in [<i>sic</i>] an imposture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Prescott</span>, 176); on consecutive days in mid-August he had dinner with Mr Cecil Booth, during which he had &#145;a very warm controversy about nonconformity, my lord affirming he never knew any dissenter that differed from [him] upon a principle, but upon humour, pride, prejudice or the like&#146;, followed by a meeting with Peter Legh, a prominent non-juror, &#145;on the subject of complying with the government and abjuration&#146;  (ibid., 185&#150;6). In the 1708&#150;9 session of parliament he attempted to amend the general naturalization bill to ensure that foreign protestants would only be naturalized if they took the Anglican communion, but this was defeated. It was, however, indicative of the tory platform that Dawes would promote from the episcopal bench. In May 1709 he gave a charge to the clergy advising them to &#145;preserve their people from Atheism, Socinianism to beware of the popish and protestant dissenters, distinguishes betwixt Toleration and Establishment, says schism is schism still &hellip; and to observe strictly the state days particularly 5 November as the day of the happy Revolution&#146;  (ibid., 238). The summer of 1709 was spent on the primary visitation of his extensive diocese, the second largest in England. He was back at Westminster for the following session, when he voted in March 1710 against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell, and later played host to this high-flying cleric's triumphal progress through Cheshire. Dawes seems to have steered clear of the type of inflammatory sermons in which Sacheverell specialized. Nicolson recorded that on 30 January 1711 Dawes preached &#145;a loyal and honest sermon&#146; and in March he reported that Dawes was ashamed that Sacheverell had read the prayers following Dawes's sermon at the celebration of the opening of a London charity school, which had degenerated into a popular demonstration of the tory cause.<br>
<br>Dawes's moderation may explain why he was one of the first tories to break with the ministry of Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, which had been formed in the wake of the Sacheverell trial in the summer of 1710. Even before the start of the 1713 session Dawes was publicly expressing his concerns over the peace treaty with France, and on the opening day of the session, on 9 April, he entered the opposition lobby on the whig motion for the peace treaties to be laid before the house. He subsequently opposed the commercial treaty with France. He continued to support legislative measures to strengthen the church, such as the bill in 1713 to give the church courts power to imprison offenders, but he remained suspicious of the ministry. However, his concerns over the protestant succession were mirrored by other leading tories and were certainly not a bar to his further promotion. Queen Anne, following the wishes of Sharp, appointed Dawes to succeed him as archbishop of York on 20 February 1714, without consulting her ministers, and he was consecrated on 9 March. From this position Dawes was again able to demonstrate concern over the succession, while supporting measures designed to further the interests of the church, including strengthening the Anglican communion by parliamentary legislation. Thus he chaired the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span> during its progress through committee in the Lords. However, his suspicions of the ministry remained, and he continued to act as a leader of the Hanoverian tories in the Lords. Following the queen's death he acted as a lord justice while the new king was travelling to Britain.<br>
<br>Dawes continued to act as a leader of the Hanoverian tories until his death. As part of George I's determination to conciliate Dawes a bill was passed in 1715 that allowed donors of more than &pound;200 in lands, money, or tithes to a poor living to acquire the right of nominating the incumbent. Dawes remained true to the tory party. He voted on 1 July 1717 for the acquittal of Oxford on charges of impeachment. However, he was keen to defend his reputation against aspersions of Jacobitism, even complaining to the Lords in 1717 about a report in the <span class="italic">St James's Evening Post</span> that criticized a &#145;Northern Prelate&#146; for ordaining two men turned out from the excise for disaffection to the government. When in December 1717 the prince of Wales (later George II) was expelled from St James's Palace, Dawes was one of the tories who offered him support and hoped to secure an alliance.<br>
<br>Dawes made a vehement speech against the bill, repealing the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span> in 1718, which led to a clash with Bishop Hoadley. He then supported the clause of Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham, aimed at preventing the growth of Socinianism. He opposed the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> in 1719 and the <span class="roman">South Sea Bill</span> in April 1720. He was also a leading member of the cabal of William, first Earl Cowper, an opposition grouping consisting mainly of tories active from 1721 to 1723, which sought to mobilize those disenchanted with the whig ministry. In the 1721&#150;2 session he seems to have been a kind of whip, responsible in part for five peers and solely responsible for the earls of Nottingham and Rochester. In January 1722 he opposed the <span class="roman">Affirmation Bill</span>. Dawes left London on 11 March 1723 to attend the wedding of his son, an event that also allowed him to dissociate himself from Bishop Francis Atterbury, who was the subject of a bill of pains and penalties for his role in Jacobite conspiracy.<br>
<br>Dawes died in Cecil Street, the Strand, London, of &#145;inflammation of the bowels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whole Works</span>, xxxiii), on 30 April 1724 and was buried in St Catharine's College, Cambridge.<br>
