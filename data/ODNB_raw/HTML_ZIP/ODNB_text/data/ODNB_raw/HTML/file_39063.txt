<span class="headword">Ridley,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1782), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, about whose background little is known, may have been related to booksellers of the same name recorded at Woodbridge in Suffolk from the 1750s. The earliest record of John Ridley as a London bookseller is in the imprint of a book published in 1763, where he is described as &#145;successor to the late Mr. Jackson&#146;  (Greene). Entries for Ridley can also be found in London trade directories from 1765, although his forename is occasionally given as &#145;James&#146;. His premises were in St James's Street. In the <span class="italic">Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue</span> there are at least 180 imprints in which Ridley is mentioned, dated between 1763 and 1782. He appears to have been particularly closely associated with Sir John Hill, some thirty of whose works published between 1765 and 1775 bear Ridley's name in the imprint. During the 1770s, he also issued a number of pamphlets on American affairs.<br>
<br>Ridley's career as a bookseller is particularly well documented. He became the principal London bookseller to the university library at G&ouml;ttingen in 1768 and continued to enjoy this position until his death. In contrast to the period after 1770 when only occasional letters are preserved, the first few years of Ridley's association with G&ouml;ttingen are especially well documented, as his invoices and accompanying letters, all very neat and legible, were considered worthy of preservation with the original lists of orders in the library's archives. These provide a rare insight into the way a high-class London bookseller in the middle of the eighteenth century acted on behalf of a foreign institutional client.<br>
<br>Ridley's letters show that he acted not merely as a supplier of books to G&ouml;ttingen but advised the library extensively on the contemporary London book trade. In selecting a bookseller to replace Thomas Osborne as G&ouml;ttingen's principal supplier, Wilhelm Best, the Hanoverian diplomat charged with supervising G&ouml;ttingen's dealings with London booksellers, may well have taken the convenient location of Ridley's shop into account: Ridley enjoyed the advantage of having premises a short distance from Best's own residence in St James's Place.<br>
<br>Ridley also brought to his work a knowledge of the current as opposed to the antiquarian trade. His emergence as G&ouml;ttingen's principal supplier took place at a time when the library was gradually moving away from the selection of antiquarian books from catalogues to the acquisition of the most significant new publications. These were mostly ordered from G&ouml;ttingen simply on the basis of brief book-trade announcements of forthcoming publications, and Ridley's advice on the status of such announcements proved invaluable. None of the 312 books that are known with certainty to have been supplied to G&ouml;ttingen by Ridley was printed before 1701.<br>
<br>The earliest Ridley bill received by Best is apparently that of 21 November 1767. The bill dated 14 February 1768 might be considered typical of those that survive. It contains thirty-six items ranging in price from 1<i>s</i>. (for copies of John Windus's <span class="italic">Journey to Mequinez</span>, London, 1725; and <span class="italic">The Examination of Doctor Franklin</span>, London, 1767), to &pound;3 3<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. (for the tenth and eleventh volumes of Sir John Hill's <span class="italic">Vegetable System</span> in folio, published by Ridley himself). The total bill was for &pound;27 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., plus 15<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for packing. G&ouml;ttingen normally placed four such orders each year.  (G&ouml;ttingen University Library, Bibl. Arch. 9a, fols. 42&#150;3).<br>
<br>In the letter accompanying his bill of February 1768, Ridley points out &#145;some few mistakes&#146;, in the G&ouml;ttingen order list &#145;with respect to prices&#146; and describes in detail his reasons for not being able to supply certain titles  (G&ouml;ttingen University Library, Bibl. Arch. 9a, fol. 45). In October 1768 he refers to a thirteenth volume of the <span class="italic">Vegetable System</span> which he has ready for publication. He has &#145;therefore taken the first opportunity to send it, and it will probably be received before it is advertised in London&#146;  (ibid., fol. 59). Further evidence of the range of Ridley's contacts within the trade and beyond is found in other letters. Although these contacts do not appear to have extended to Scotland or Ireland, he was at least prepared to enter into correspondence on G&ouml;ttingen's behalf with booksellers in Dublin, for example, or with authors about forthcoming publications. The standard of service and knowledge of the current trade shown in the correspondence contrast strongly with other London booksellers' communications in the library's archive, and show Ridley to have been the ideal bookseller for the university when there was a requirement for the rapid and efficient acquisition of new publications.<br>
<br>Ridley died on 22 February 1782 at his home, 77 St James's Street, London. In the same year Wilhelm Best retired to Hanover. Ridley's business was taken on by George Harlow, who appears to have continued to receive most of G&ouml;ttingen's orders. Ridley's own family relationships are unknown, although diocesan records mention the death of his wife on 31 December 1774. It is possible that the Joseph Ridley who exhibited a printing press at the Royal Society of Arts in 1795 was also a relative.<br>
