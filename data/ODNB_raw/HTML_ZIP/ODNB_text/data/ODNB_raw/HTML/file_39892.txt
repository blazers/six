<span class="headword">O'Neill, Sir  Con Douglas Walter</span>  (1912&#150;1988), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in London on 3 June 1912, the second of the three surviving sons (there were no daughters) of Sir (Robert William) Hugh O'Neill (later first Baron Rathcavan), privy councillor and politician, and his wife, Sylvia Irene, daughter of Walter Albert Sandeman, of Morden House, Royston. He attended Eton College and achieved early academic distinction with a scholarship from Eton to Balliol College, Oxford, a first class in English in 1934, and a law fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford, the following year (held until 1946). In 1936 he was called to the bar (Inner Temple) and in the same year entered the diplomatic service.<br>
<br>O'Neill was posted to Berlin as third secretary in 1938; he resigned in 1939 because he disagreed with Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement. He served in the army intelligence corps from 1940 to 1943 and was then employed in the Foreign Office. In 1946 he left to become a leader writer on <span class="italic">The Times</span> but returned to the Foreign Office the following year. From then on he rose steadily in the hierarchy; posts in Frankfurt am Main and Bonn were followed by a period as head of the news department in 1954&#150;5, charg&eacute; d'affaires in Beijing (1955&#150;7), a return to the Foreign Office as assistant under-secretary in 1957, and posts as ambassador to Finland (1961&#150;3) and ambassador to the European Communities in Brussels (1963&#150;5). He returned to the Foreign Office as deputy under-secretary, and hoped in 1968 to go to Bonn as ambassador. Germany had been his first post; his German was impeccable and he would have carried considerable weight. But the foreign secretary, George Brown, vetoed this proposal; it was a question of temperamental incompatibility. O'Neill did not dispute his right to do so but resigned to start a career in the City with Hill Samuel.<br>
<br>In 1969 O'Neill was recalled to the Foreign Office to head the team which would negotiate Britain's entry into the European Community. This task successfully accomplished, he left the Foreign Office for the last time in 1972, after writing the official history of the negotiations. From 1972 to 1974 he was chairman of the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce; and he was a director of Unigate from 1974 to 1983. In 1974 and in 1975, the year of the referendum, he performed a last service to the European cause as director of the Britain in Europe campaign.<br>
<br>O'Neill was one of the outstanding diplomats of his generation. His intellect was impressive, his reasoning always a masterpiece of logic, and his analysis of any situation penetrating and accurate. To this he brought a lucidity of expression which served him well as a leader writer on <span class="italic">The Times</span>; some felt that he could have edited the newspaper with distinction. In appearance he resembled one of Anthony Trollope's elders of the church: bald, bespectacled, with an air of measured dignity, and with a voice distinctly canonical. His manner had something of the formality of a previous generation, but those who dealt with him rapidly found that underneath there lurked a delightful sense of humour and a seemingly inexhaustible fund of Irish stories.<br>
<br>O'Neill was also a man of unbending principle. If he thought a policy was wrong he said so in clear and measured terms without any thought of the consequences for his career. It was most unusual for a diplomat to leave the Foreign Office three times before retirement and yet rise to posts of the highest distinction. His greatest accomplishment was the British entry into the European Community. On this the country was bitterly divided and the complexities of the negotiation vast. In addition he had to carry with him the senior officials on the team who vigorously defended the interests of their departments. Through all these hazards he steered his team with imperturbable patience and skill, gaining the confidence and respect of all he dealt with, whether among Britain's European partners or in Whitehall. The success of the negotiations was one of the great achievements in the history of British diplomacy; it owed much to his efforts.<br>
<br>O'Neill was appointed CMG in 1953, KCMG in 1962, and GCMG in 1972. He was married three times, first in 1940 to Rosemary Margaret, daughter of Harold Pritchard MD. They had a son, and a daughter, Onora, who became principal of Newnham College, Cambridge. The marriage was dissolved in 1954 (his wife subsequently became Lady Garvey) and in that year he married Baroness Carola Hertha Adolphine Emma Harriet Luise (M&auml;dy) Marschall von Bieberstein, a widow, and the daughter of Baron Max Reinhard August von Holzing-Berstett. She died in 1960 and in 1961 he married Anne-Marie Lindberg of Helsinki, daughter of Bertil Jungstr&ouml;m, civil engineer, of Stockholm. O'Neill died on 11 January 1988 at St Stephen's Hospital, London.<br>
