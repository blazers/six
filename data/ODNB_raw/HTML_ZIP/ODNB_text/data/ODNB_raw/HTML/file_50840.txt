<span class="headword">Bohm,  David Joseph</span>  (1917&#150;1992), <span class="occ">physicist and philosopher</span>, was born on 20 December 1917 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, USA, the son of Samuel Bohm, proprietor of a furniture store, and his wife, Freda. Both parents were immigrants from Europe, his father being born in the Ukraine. Bohm graduated from Pennsylvania State College in 1939 and after a period at the California Institute of Technology moved to Berkeley where he studied for his PhD on proton&#150;deuteron scattering under Robert Oppenheimer. He then began work on plasmas and established his reputation as a theoretical physicist developing important theoretical techniques to describe collective oscillations of plasmas and deriving a formula for what has become known as the Bohm diffusion coefficient. After moving to Princeton in 1947, working with his research student, David Pines, Bohm was able to extend these ideas to the description of electrons in metals, laying the foundations of our understanding of the collective behaviour of electrons in metals. Problems in the interpretation of quantum theory fascinated him and he set out to write a book which would make the widely accepted Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, with its inherent randomness and observer dependence, as clear as possible. His <span class="italic">Quantum Theory</span> (1951) has become a classic in the field and is remarkable for its clarity and physical insight; his formulation of the Einstein&#150;Podolsky&#150;Rosen experiment formed the basis of important experimental tests of quantum theory and his discussion of the theory of measurement became the standard. Not satisfied with the Copenhagen interpretation, Bohm developed a causal interpretation of quantum theory, which he published in the <span class="italic">Physical Review</span> in 1952. Similar ideas had been published previously by Louis de Broglie and the interpretation became known as the de Broglie&#150;Bohm interpretation. This interpretation brought out the revolutionary features of quantum theory in a clear and accessible way, without the postulate of inherent randomness in nature. Bohm's approach made clear the essential unity of quantum phenomena manifested in his approach through a non-local connection of distant events. Difficulties with the House Un-American Activities Committee led to Bohm's being suspended from Princeton, but supported by both Einstein and Oppenheimer he obtained a professorship at the University of S&atilde;o Paulo in 1951.<br>
<br>In 1955 Bohm moved to the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa where he met Saral (Sarah) Woolfson, the daughter of an English doctor; they were married in March 1956 and had no children. They moved to England in 1957 and Bohm took up a fellowship at Bristol University where, with Yakir Aharonov, he published a paper on the magnetic vector potential describing an effect now known as the Aharonov&#150;Bohm effect. In 1961 Bohm was appointed to the newly created chair of theoretical physics at Birkbeck College, where he remained until his retirement in 1983. Bohm believed that the problems faced by modern physics could not be solved in a truly satisfactory manner within the usual Cartesian conceptual framework and sought to construct a description based on the notion of primitive processes out of which space, time, and matter would emerge. Working with Basil Hiley, he investigated the use of algebraic structures to describe such primitive processes. A renewed interest in his interpretation of quantum theory was stimulated in the late 1970s when his research students began to use computational techniques to calculate quantum particle trajectories in order to demonstrate exactly how the theory worked. After years of neglect Bohm's interpretation is now widely accepted as a viable alternative to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation.<br>
<br>In concert with Bohm's work in physics he maintained a deep interest in wider philosophical issues; he explored notions of wholeness and fragmentation across a wide spectrum of thought, and his insight was valued in diverse disciplines. Many of his general ideas on language and thought arose from his friendship and collaboration with Jiddo Krishnamurti, an Indian philosopher and teacher. Their formal dialogues, held in Switzerland, California, and England, were recorded and some were published. Bohm was for some years a trustee of Krishnamurti's foundation school in Hampshire. Bohm was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1990 and was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson medal in 1991. He died in Edgware General Hospital on 27 October 1992.<br>
