<span class="headword">Green,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1734, <em>d.</em> 1771), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was baptized in Wentworth, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, on 26 December 1734, the youngest son of Joshua Green, a farmer of Swinton. He obtained most of his education from his eldest brother, the Revd John Green, who was master of a school at Denmark Street, Westminster, where Charles later worked as an assistant teacher. In 1760 he became assistant to the astronomer royal, James Bradley, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, succeeding Charles Mason, who went to the Cape of Good Hope to observe the transit of Venus. Green himself observed the transit with Bradley at Greenwich on 6 June 1761.<br>
<br>When Bradley died in July 1762, Green remained at Greenwich as assistant to his successor, Nathaniel Bliss, who was in precarious health and spent much of his time in Oxford, with the result that most of the observational work at Greenwich fell to Green. In August 1763 the board of longitude asked Green to go to Barbados with Nevil Maskelyne to make observations in connection with the trial of the fourth timekeeper of John Harrison. Bliss agreed that a temporary assistant should be provided at Greenwich until his return.<br>
<br>Green and Maskelyne embarked in the <i>Princess Louisa</i> (60 guns) at Spithead on 9 September 1763 and reached Barbados on 7 November, when they set up an observatory ashore and began observations to settle the longitude of the island. William Harrison (John Harrison's son) and the timekeeper arrived on 13 May 1764, the necessary observations were made, and Green sailed for home on 4 June, reaching Greenwich in July.<br>
<br>Bliss died in September 1764, and Green took charge of the observatory until the arrival of the new astronomer royal, Maskelyne, in March 1765. His Greenwich observations were published at the end of the second volume of Bradley's <span class="italic">Observations</span> (1805). On 5 September 1765 Green's youngest sister, Mary, married the astronomer and mathematician William Wales at Greenwich.<br>
<br>Despite past disagreements, Maskelyne recommended that Green should go with James Cook to observe the 1769 transit of Venus in the Pacific, which Green, then serving as purser in the frigate <i>Aurora</i>, agreed to do for 200 guineas. On 8 March 1768 he married Elizabeth Long in London, and on 26 August the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Plymouth. Green and Cook successfully observed the transit together in Tahiti on 3 June 1769. During the subsequent exploration of New Zealand and Australia, Green was, in Cook's words,<blockquote>indefatigable in making and calculating these observations [for latitude and longitude] which otherwise must have taken up a great deal of my time &hellip; Not only this, but by his instructions several of the petty officers can make and calculate these observations almost as well as himself. (<span class="italic">Journals</span>, 392)</blockquote>Before the <i>Endeavour</i> arrived in Batavia in October 1770 (whence the records of his Venus observations were dispatched to England), Green had been sick with scurvy and dysentery. He died at sea of fever on 29 January 1771.<blockquote>He had long been in a bad state of health, which he took no care to repair but on the contrary lived in such a manner as greatly promoted the disorders he had had long upon him, this brought on the Flux which put a period to his life. (<span class="italic">Journals</span>, 448)</blockquote>
