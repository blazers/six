<span class="headword">Phesant,  Peter</span>  (1584&#150;1649), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of Peter Phesant, barrister, of Barkworth, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Vincent Fulnetby. Admitted to Gray's Inn on 26 October 1602, he was called to the bar in 1608. About the following year he married Mary Bruges, who came from a Gloucestershire family. Having become a common pleader of London, he was elected a bencher of his inn in 1623, and was reader in the autumn of 1624. Following the death of his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66941/', "Mary Weld, Lady Weld")</script>, in 1623, as one of her executors Phesant was energetically involved in the arrangements for her substantial charitable benefactions. From 1630 to 1641 he was steward of the manor of Hackney, Middlesex. He was appointed a serjeant-at-law in May 1640 and in the following year he was a justice of assize for Nottinghamshire. On 10 March 1642 Sir Edward Herbert, the attorney-general, asked for Phesant's services as defence counsel during Herbert's impeachment, but Phesant excused himself on the grounds of ill health. Briefly, from 2 May 1643, he was recorder of London. He had already, in February that year, been proposed to the king as a potential judge of common pleas, but was not voted in by parliament until 30 September 1645; he was formally appointed on 7 October. Meanwhile, by March 1644 he was engaged with Serjeant Henry Rolle in the project to print Edward Coke's work &#145;for the good of the commonwealth&#146;  (Green, 312).<br>
<br>By this time Phesant had accumulated considerable wealth. In June 1644 he was assessed at &pound;1000. He had a large estate at Upwood in Huntingdonshire and properties in London; about 1647 he also had the lease of a house in Warwick Lane in the city, belonging to Sir John Bramston. He was re-appointed to his judgeship on 9 February 1649, but by June was acknowledged to be unwell. His will, drawn up on 22 September, left generous bequests to his wife, his sons Stephen and Nathaniel, and his sons-in-law William Cheney, John Sotherton, and Christopher Goodfellow; fellow lawyers Bramston and Sir Robert Berkeley were the overseers. Phesant died at Upwood on 1 October, and was buried in the church there.<br>
