<span class="headword">Marmion,  Joseph Aloysius</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Columba]</span>  (1858&#150;1923), <span class="occ">abbot of Maredsous and author</span>, was born on 1 April 1858 in Dublin, the son of William Marmion (1820&#150;1878), a corn factor, and his wife, Herminie Cordier (1820&#150;1894), a Frenchwoman and language teacher who had recently gone to Ireland. They lived first at 57 Queen Street, but later moved to 2 Blackhall Place, Dublin. There were nine children in the family.<br>
<br>Marmion received his first formal education at St Laurence O'Toole's school, St John's Lane, Dublin. In January 1869 he began his secondary education at Belvedere College, Dublin, remaining there until December 1873. By then he had passed his matriculation examination and also successfully gained a scholarship which entitled him to a place in Holy Cross College, Clonliffe, the Dublin diocesan seminary. During the next five years he obtained the degree of BA from the Royal University of Ireland, and studied both philosophy and theology with a view to becoming a priest in the Dublin diocese. In December 1879 he was sent to Rome to complete his theological studies. He lodged at the Irish College, but enrolled as a student at the College of Propaganda, Rome, where in 1881 he completed his studies for the priesthood, being awarded the gold medal as the most outstanding student of the year. He was ordained priest in Rome on 16 June 1881.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1881 Marmion returned to Ireland. His first appointment, in September 1881, as priest in the archdiocese of Dublin, was to a curacy in the parish of Dundrum, co. Dublin. There he built up a considerable reputation for himself as a very caring pastor. His name was still remembered in this parish at the end of the twentieth century in the name of the large day-care centre in Dundrum village, Marmion House, managed by a voluntary group, the Marmion Society, to look after the old and the infirm in the parish. After only a year in Dundrum, Marmion was appointed professor of philosophy at his former alma mater, Holy Cross College, Clonliffe. He held this position from September 1882 to October 1886. At the same time he served as chaplain to the Redemptoristine convent in Drumcondra, Dublin, and to the prisoners in Mountjoy gaol.<br>
<br>Despite his success as pastor and professor Marmion felt himself called to lead a more contemplative life. For some years he had been in touch with the Benedictine monks of the abbey of Maredsous, Belgium, which had been founded in 1872. There were no Benedictine monasteries in Ireland at this time, but in any case Marmion wished to emulate the ancient Irish monks, who went into exile as the supreme sacrifice. He entered Maredsous on 21 November 1886 as a novice. Following the custom of the time Marmion was given a new name, Columba. At the end of his time as a novice, on 10 February 1888, Marmion made his first profession as a monk. Three years later, on 10 February 1891, he made his solemn or final profession. He remained in Maredsous, living the monastic life of study and prayer, until 1899, when he was sent to Louvain, the leading Catholic university town in Belgium, as part of a team to establish a monastery there called Mont C&eacute;sar (later called Kaisersberg). He spent the next ten years in Louvain as prior of Mont C&eacute;sar with special responsibility for the studies of the young monks. During this time Marmion built up a reputation as a popular retreat giver and spiritual director, and was also in demand as external examiner in theology at the university. Much of his time was also taken up writing letters&#151;some two thousand of which have been preserved&#151;giving spiritual advice to people who sought his counsel.<br>
<br>On 28 September 1909 Marmion was elected the third abbot of Maredsous. He received the abbatial blessing in Maredsous on 3 October 1909. During his long tenure of office (1909&#150;23), he ruled over a community of some 130 monks, which proved a time consuming and tiring business. However, these domestic or monastic commitments did not deter him from numerous external interests and pursuits. From March 1913 to October 1914 he became involved in the Caldy affair. The Anglican Benedictine community on Caldy Island, under their abbot, Aelred Carlyle, decided to join the Roman Catholic church. Marmion was one of those who helped to see this transition successfully carried through.<br>
<br>Soon after the First World War broke out, in August 1914, Marmion was obliged to leave Maredsous, and brought his junior monks to Ireland, where they found asylum at Edermine House, near Enniscorthy. He remained in Ireland until early 1916, when he made his way back, via England and Holland, to the abbey of Maredsous. In the post-war years he found himself caught up in a number of physically exhausting enterprises. First he was asked to send a group of Belgian monks to occupy the Benedictine abbey of Dormition in Jerusalem, replacing temporarily the German monks, who had been expelled by the occupying British authorities. This venture lasted from December 1918 to September 1920, when the German monks were allowed to return. Marmion's second, and perhaps most lasting, undertaking, was the setting up, in 1922, of the Belgian congregation of Benedictine abbeys. This meant a separation from the pre-war Beuronese (German) congregation or confederation, a necessary step, given the anti-German feelings in Belgium at this time.<br>
<br>During his final years as abbot of Maredsous, Marmion produced three books of spirituality in French, which have since become classics, translated into fifteen languages. The English titles are: <span class="italic">Christ, the Life of the Soul</span> (1917), <span class="italic">Christ, in his Mysteries</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">Christ, the Ideal of the Monk</span> (1922). Marmion's last public appearance was at the golden jubilee celebrations of the founding of the abbey of Maredsous, on 15 October 1922. Two months later he had an attack of influenza, being one of the many who succumbed to the epidemic then raging in Belgium. He rallied somewhat and was able to spend a week in Antwerp in early January 1923, when he had his portrait painted by Joseph Janssens. By 26 January he was diagnosed as having bronchial pneumonia, which was complicated by uraemia and a high fever. He died on 30 January 1923 at 10 p.m. in Maredsous. The funeral took place on 3 February. He was laid to rest in the abbots' vault, under the shadow of the abbey church. Marmion was beatified on 3 September 2000. His feast day is 3 October.<br>
