<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  John Richard</span>  (1828&#150;1903), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, born on 2 November 1828 at Witham, Essex, was the second son of eight children of Richard Robinson, Congregational minister, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of John Dennant, also a Congregational minister, of Halesworth, Suffolk. At eleven he entered the school for the sons of Congregational ministers, then at Lewisham. Withdrawn from school on 26 June 1843, he was apprenticed to a firm of booksellers at Shepton Mallet. His ambitions, however, were directed towards journalism, and his first effort was a descriptive account (in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, 14 February 1846) of a meeting of Wiltshire labourers to protest against the corn laws. After reporting for the <span class="italic">Bedford Mercury</span>, he obtained a post on the <span class="italic">Wiltshire Independent</span> at Devizes, and soon sent regular reports of the local markets to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. In 1848 Robinson went to London; having become a Unitarian, he was made sub-editor of a Unitarian journal, <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, and did most of the work for John Lalor, the editor. His next post was on the <span class="italic">Weekly News and Chronicle</span>, under John Sheehan, and in 1855 he became editor of <span class="italic">The Express</span>, an evening paper in the same hands as the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. At the same time he was a prolific contributor elsewhere. He cherished a deep interest in movements for freedom throughout Europe. He had a profound reverence for Mazzini, who asked to make his acquaintance after reading an appreciation of himself from Robinson's pen; he also knew Kossuth, Garibaldi, and other revolutionary leaders.<br>
<br>Now settled in London, on 14 July 1859 he married Jane Mapes (<i>d</i>. 1876), youngest daughter of William Granger of The Grange, Wickham Bishop, Essex; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1868, when the price of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> was reduced to 1<i>d</i>., Robinson was appointed general manager. Under his direction the fortunes of the paper, which had been falling, quickly rose. He saw that the public demanded news not only quickly but in an attractive form. At the start of the Franco-Prussian War he instructed his correspondents to telegraph descriptive details and not merely bare facts, and after the war was well in progress he secured, with exemplary promptitude, the services of Archibald Forbes, who long remained a valuable contributor. At the prompting of another correspondent, John Edwin Hilary Skinner, he started the French Peasants Relief Fund, which reached a total of &pound;20,000. On 22 June 1876 Edwin Pears of Constantinople contributed to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> the first of a series of letters describing Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria. Public indignation was roused, and Robinson sent out an American journalist, Januarius Aloysius MacGahan, who was accompanied by Eugene Schuyler, the American consul-general in Turkey, to make enquiries. Pears's charges were corroborated, and Robinson's services were warmly acknowledged by the Bulgarians.<br>
<br>In 1887 Robinson became titular editor of the <span class="italic">News</span>, the actual night editing being carried on chiefly by Peter William Clayden. In 1893 he was knighted. The fortunes of the paper meanwhile declined, to the alarm of the Liberal Party leadership. On 1 February 1896 E. T. Cook became editor with undivided control of policy and Robinson resumed his post of manager, though he later regretted not retiring  (Koss, 365). During 1899 and 1900 Cook&#151;a follower of Lord Rosebery&#151;supported the South African War, but Robinson's sympathies were with the Boers. Early in 1901, in a coup masterminded by Lloyd George, the paper was captured by the pro-Boers. Robinson declined the offer of a consultant directorship and retired, aged seventy-two  (Koss, 398).<br>
<br>Robinson was an habitu&eacute; of the Reform Club, and formed one of the circle in which James Payn, William Black, Sir Wemyss Reid, Frank Finlay, and George Augustus Sala were conspicuous. He was an excellent raconteur and mimic, a great reader, especially of modern French literature, and a regular &#145;first-night&#146; attender at the leading theatres. In 1854 he had become a professional member of the Guild of Literature and Art, a society founded by Charles Dickens and his friends for the benefit of authors and artists. The guild failed to fulfil the aims of its founders, and Robinson with Frederick Clifford, as the last surviving trustees, arranged for its dissolution in 1897. In that year he was chairman of the journalists' Newspaper Press Fund dinner, and in 1898 of the proprietors' Newspaper Society dinner.<br>
<br>Robinson died in London on 30 November 1903, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Though he bridged the activities of editing and managing, he was innovatory in neither, and was unable to combat Unionist press dominance after 1886.<br>
