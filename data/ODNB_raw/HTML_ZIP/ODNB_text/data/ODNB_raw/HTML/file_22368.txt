<span class="headword">Playfair,  Lyon</span>, first Baron Playfair  (1818&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician and chemist</span>, was born on 21 May 1818 at either Meerut  (<span class="italic">Who's Who</span>) or Chunar in Bengal  (Reid), second son of eight children of George Playfair (1782&#150;1846), chief inspector-general of hospitals in Bengal, and his wife, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1862), daughter of John Ross of Edinburgh. Lyon was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22366/', "James Playfair (1738&#150;1819)")</script>, nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22365/', "Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair (1786&#150;1861)")</script>, and older brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22369/', "Sir Robert Lambert Playfair (1828&#150;1899)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Playfair was sent from India in 1820 to be raised by an aunt in St Andrews, and later by his mother, and did not see his father again until he was twenty-two. After enjoying several years at the parish school from 1824, he endured a narrow schooling in Latin at the city's old grammar school before entering the University of St Andrews in 1832. Here he was inspired by illicit attendance at chemistry lectures to attempt the extraction of sugar from beetroot in the family kitchens. In 1835 he was sent to his uncle James in Glasgow to train as a merchant, but his medical ambitions soon prevailed. Having enrolled at Anderson's University, along with such students as James Young and David Livingstone, Playfair won prizes in the chemistry classes of Thomas Graham. After Graham left in 1837 Playfair continued medical studies at Edinburgh University, befriending John Goodsir and Edward Forbes. However, he soon had to abandon his degree after contracting severe eczema in the dissection room. Following paternal advice he travelled to Calcutta, where work as a merchant's clerk had been arranged for him. However, he so impressed the local college's professor of chemistry, William O'Shaughnessy, that Lyon's father was prevailed upon to return him to scientific pursuits in Britain, for which he sailed in 1838.<br>
<br>At University College, London, Lyon attended medical lectures and became a laboratory assistant&#151;alongside Young&#151;to the professor of chemistry, Thomas Graham. In 1839 Graham advised Playfair to study with Europe's most eminent organic chemist, Justus von Liebig. Playfair soon became a star pupil in the Giessen laboratories through his discoveries of a new fatty acid in the butter of nutmeg, and a new crystalline substance in cloves. Such was Liebig's faith in his outstanding disciple that he invited Playfair to produce an English translation of his great book, <span class="italic">Die organische Chemie in ihre Anwendung auf Agriculture und Physiologie</span> (1840, several editions), and to represent his work on this subject at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) in 1840. Here Playfair's abilities were noted by the geologists William Buckland and Henry De la Beche, and also by a number of chemical manufacturers. After returning to Giessen to take his PhD in 1841, and co-operating in the founding of the Chemical Society in Britain, Playfair was appointed as chemical manager of the Primrose dye works near Clitheroe. Foreseeing the imminent demise of luxury calico printing, Playfair resigned within a year, having already helped to quell one of the labour riots that swept across Lancashire in the summer of 1842.<h2>
<a name="Arisingreputation"></a>A rising reputation</h2>Impressed by Playfair's public lectures and his plan for supplying cheap water to lower-class tenements, the Royal Institution of Manchester made him an honorary professor of chemistry; he thereupon commenced an extensive series of researches with James P. Joule on atomic volume and specific gravity. As a distinguished pupil of Liebig, the impecunious Playfair found his reputation much enhanced by the famous chemist's popular British tour in 1842, and in October Michael Faraday wrote to offer Playfair the chair in chemistry at King's College, Toronto. On arriving in London to accept the post, Playfair was surprised to be invited to an audience with Sir Robert Peel, Buckland, and De la Beche, in which the prime minister persuaded Playfair not to leave the country. One year later Peel nominated him as a member of the royal commission on sanitation, the critical results of which were published in <span class="italic">The State of Large Towns in Lancashire</span> (1845). Playfair also received a BAAS grant to collaborate with Bunsen of Heidelberg in studying the efficiency of charcoal iron furnaces, basing his work in 1844 at Derbyshire premises owned by the father of Margaret Eliza Oakes. Continuing researches at Manchester in this period covered such topics as cow's milk and the physiology of cattle, the nature of human sleep, and an analysis of palmic acid.<br>
<br>Playfair moved to London in 1845 on becoming chemist to the Geological Survey. A small teaching laboratory had been created for him there, and Edward Frankland (1825&#150;1899) was appointed as his assistant. As a public servant, however, Playfair was soon summoned to advise on the ventilation of Buckingham Palace, his assessment of which was so alarming that the report was kept from parliament. Next he received Peel's request to investigate the devastating potato blight in Ireland, his deeply pessimistic conclusions upon which encouraged Peel to repeal the corn laws. Playfair's marriage to Margaret Eliza Oakes (<i>d</i>. 1855) in 1846 produced a daughter, Jessie, and a son, George, later Major George Playfair of the Royal Artillery, and the second Baron Playfair; Lyon Playfair's father died in the same year. Soon afterwards Playfair arranged for Young to extract paraffin from the rare naphtha spring on his brother-in-law's Derbyshire estate, thereby aiding the launch of the petroleum industry in 1847. Playfair's researches for the Geological Survey mostly concerned coal gases, colliery explosions, and an analysis of the coal best suited to the navy's steamships. Elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1848, his reputation was reaffirmed in an outstanding study of the loss of condensation volume in hydrated minerals, and the discovery of the nitroprussides.<h2>
<a name="Playfairandtheprinceconsort"></a>Playfair and the prince consort</h2>In 1848&#150;9 Playfair was not only called upon to combat a serious cholera epidemic, but was also recommended by Peel as the best person to assist and advise the prince consort on his new invention for filtering royal sewage to fertilize the Osborne estate. As a fellow German speaker who was widely respected in British industry, Playfair was next appointed, in early 1850, as a special commissioner to assist the prince with his somewhat faltering plans for an international exhibition. Playfair's privileged access to the prince consort initially caused jealousy among the existing commissioners, and a court secretary complained that Playfair was of &#145;low birth, ordinary appearance and uncouth manners&#146;  (Fulford, 218). Diplomatically smoothing away such animosities, Playfair visited northern manufacturers to muster their support for the exhibition, persuading the prince to adopt a display classification more congenial to these potential exhibitors. Before and during the 1851 Great Exhibition Playfair managed the prize-awarding juries and attended to the royal family, a role which rapidly brought appointment as commander of the Bath and gentleman usher to the prince consort.<br>
<br>In November 1851 Playfair was appointed professor of chemistry at the new government-run School of Mines. He now attacked the complacency he saw arising from the easy predominance of British manufacturers among the Great Exhibition's prize-winners. At the prince's behest, in 1852, Playfair undertook a tour of European universities and colleges to ascertain the education in arts and sciences available in rival countries. His conclusions were unfavourable for the economic future of British manufacturing, and his well-attended School of Mines lecture, &#145;Industrial instruction on the continent&#146;, provoked a debate on the need for national promotion of technical education. In 1853 Playfair was appointed as secretary for science, alongside Henry Cole as secretary for art, in the newly constituted Department of Science and Art (DSA). Despite the prince consort's close involvement with the constitution of the DSA and Playfair's ready access to him at court, Playfair's years at the DSA were not productive. He tried to launch a national scheme of science schools co-ordinated through a central administration in South Kensington, but found himself &#145;preaching in the wilderness&#146; to an unsympathetic population  (Reid, 152). Playfair's troubles culminated in 1855 when his first wife died, leaving him in charge of two young children.<br>
<br>Apart from an investigation of ferrocyanides, the bereaved Playfair accomplished little until 1857. Then marriage to the wealthy Jean Ann Millington (<i>d</i>. 1877) enabled him to buy out half of his work for the DSA, and later brought him another daughter, Ethel Mary. Playfair also accepted the presidency of the Chemical Society for two years, during which time he took up the professorship of chemistry at Edinburgh University, in 1858. There he was active in the politics of the Senatus, but still had to pay for his extensive teaching laboratories out of his personal funds. Reluctantly resigning his position at court, Playfair none the less retained the faith of the queen and consort, who sent their sons Albert Edward, prince of Wales, and Alfred, duke of Edinburgh, to study under him; Playfair famously instructed the former to plunge his moistened hand into a vat of boiling white lead to demonstrate the harmlessness of this experiment. Much saddened by the prince consort's death in 1861, Playfair paid tribute to the prince in his work for the 1862 international exhibition, and co-ordinated plans for the Edinburgh memorial to him in 1863&#150;4.<h2>
<a name="Edinburghresearchesandpoliticalcareer"></a>Edinburgh researches and political career</h2>Playfair later described his tenure at Edinburgh as that of a quiet academic life, yet up to 1863, and occasionally thereafter, he and his assistants&#151;notably Frederick Guthrie and James Dewar&#151;busied themselves in laboratory researches chiefly concerning the density of carbon allotropes, vapour densities of volatile liquids, and the constitution of salts. Parliamentary calls for Playfair's expert advice were unremitting, however, and in 1862&#150;3 he chaired a royal commission which recommended the abolition of ineffective seasonal restrictions on herring fishing. More controversial was the outcome of the 1865 royal commission on the cattle plague (the rampant rinderpest), the unpopularly ruthless conclusions of which were only implemented after widespread reading of Playfair's pamphlet on the history of the disease's recurrence. In 1867 Playfair took his own long-held educational concerns to parliament in lobbying for an investigation of the outcome of the Paris Universal Exhibition. His somewhat personal interpretation as exhibition juror was that a decline in British industrial prestige was attributable to a national deficiency in technical instruction. Such was the widespread anxiety that Playfair succeeded in cultivating on this matter, that a select committee was set up to investigate under Bernhard Samuelson in 1868.<br>
<br>In the same year Playfair helped to secure electoral representation for the Scottish universities, thereby creating the seat for Edinburgh and St Andrews universities for which Playfair himself stood in November 1868. Although generally an avowed &#145;Gladstonian&#146; Liberal, Playfair won over this tory constituency by his reputation in public services and the &#145;strong bond of attachment&#146; he enjoyed with his many former students  (Reid, 210). On taking up his Westminster seat in 1869 after resigning his chair, Playfair also found himself representing the concerns of science, Sir Joseph Hooker dubbing him in 1873 as &#145;the only scientific man&#146; to whom the government cared to listen on educational matters  (Imperial College Playfair MSS, fol. 358). Playfair's speeches were prominent in debates on health issues, but were especially decisive in the collapse of Gladstone's <span class="roman">Irish Universities Bill</span>. Playfair's appointment as postmaster-general in 1873 acknowledged his invention of the postcard in 1870, but also served to soften his criticisms of Gladstone's administration.<br>
<br>After losing the position of postmaster-general after the general election of 1874, Playfair devoted time to managing the business affairs of the 1851 commissioners, whose ranks he had joined in 1869. Before long Disraeli asked him to preside over a commission inquiring into the administration of the civil service. Its first report of 1875 established the basis of the unjustly eponymous &#145;Playfair scheme&#146; which introduced competitive examinations and two streams of appointments, thereby earning Playfair the recurrent antagonism of clerks in the lower tier. In 1875&#150;6 he engaged in the heated parliamentary debates on vivisection, promoting a bill on behalf of physiologists that sanctioned painful experiments when performed under anaesthesia, rendering Playfair the target of highly personalized attacks from antivivisectionists. In 1877 Playfair was disappointed at the widespread indifference which greeted his efforts for the Scottish university commission of 1876, and his distress was heightened by the death of his second wife.<br>
<br>In the summer of that year Playfair travelled to the USA, where he met Edith Russell, whom he married in 1878, thereby forging strong family links to the American continent. On returning to Westminster he was given the delicate task of chairing a committee to adjudicate on Manchester's plans for a scheme to draw water from Lake Thirlmere. At the general election in 1879 Playfair found his tory constituents increasingly disaffected, but narrowly retained his seat. He was appointed by Gladstone as deputy speaker and chairman of ways and means the following year. The issue of Irish home rule dominated this administration, as a result of which Playfair had to deal with many attempts by Irish MPs to obstruct the operations of the house. The press attacked Playfair's toleration of their tactics, but also criticized his reluctant (and yet well-precedented) move to suspend several offending MPs from the house in July 1882. Finding that the cabinet did not support his interpretation of the precedent, Playfair later resigned; he was made KCB in 1883 at the speaker's insistence, but this was no consolation for his lost prospect of a cabinet position. On the back benches Playfair successfully defended his 1876 <span class="roman">Cruelty to Animals Bill</span> against the vocal opposition of antivivisectionists, and spoke persuasively in favour of compulsory vaccination; he also became honorary secretary of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and sought to redress the financial deficits of the prince consort's legacy.<br>
<br>Playfair's reputation outside Westminster came to the fore again in 1885 when he served as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. After his Irish sympathies forced him to relinquish his university seat he was overwhelmed by offers of new parliamentary constituencies, and settled for the chiefly working-class district of South Leeds. In Gladstone's short ministry of 1886, Playfair was vice-president of the committee of council on education, but out of office later that year he once again promoted the causes of technical education and now also spoke out more vigorously on workers' wages, free trade, and transatlantic harmony. By the time he stood down as secretary of the 1851 commissioners in 1889, he had transformed their finances to yield an annual surplus of &pound;5000 devoted to 1851 Exhibition scholarships for domestic and colonial students; in the same year Playfair published his principal public addresses in <span class="italic">Subjects of Social Welfare</span>.<h2>
<a name="BaronPlayfairofStAndrews"></a>Baron Playfair of St Andrews</h2>Playfair was created Baron Playfair of St Andrews in 1892, whereupon he left the Commons and was made lord-in-waiting to Queen Victoria. In the following years he spoke in favour of university extension, advised on the Venezuela question, and served on a royal commission on the aged poor that proposed state pensions. On Lord Rosebery's recommendation his political eminence was rewarded by his appointment as GCB in 1895. Despite failing health, in 1897 Playfair proposed the creation of a new museum at South Kensington, proposing the title &#145;Victorian Museum&#146; in honour of the queen's jubilee. He did not, however, live to see its opening as the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1899: affected &#145;profoundly&#146; by Gladstone's recent death  (Reid, 465), Playfair died at his home, 68 Onslow Gardens, South Kensington, on 29 May 1898, and was buried by the ruined cathedral of St Andrews on 4 June. He was survived by his third wife.<br>
<br>In appearance Playfair was short with a &#145;fine&#146; head of &#145;massive moulding&#146;  (Reid, 10), and had a countenance which so closely resembled that of his friend Charles Wheatstone that Mrs Wheatstone once mistook Playfair for her own husband. He maintained a passionate commitment to Scottish affairs and a singular sympathy for German culture throughout his life, and his considerable tact and conversational skill enabled Playfair to move with relative ease through the company of manufacturers, politicians, and the royal family alike&#151;although some scientists resented his haughty manner. His speeches on scientific and parliamentary subjects were &#145;luminous&#146; in delivery  (Roscoe), albeit often diplomatic in content, and divulged no religious convictions. Latterly, Playfair accrued substantial wealth through his successive marriages, directorships, and a period serving as chairman of the Bovril Company. Considering Playfair's contributions to health and education, and his prominence in over five decades of royal commissions and parliamentary inquiries, posterity might not share the opinion of his friend and biographer Reid that Playfair's life was &#145;most useful&#146; but not a &#145;great&#146; one  (Reid, 5).<br>
