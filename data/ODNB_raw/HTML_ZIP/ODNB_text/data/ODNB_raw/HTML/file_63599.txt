<span class="headword">Margarot,  Maurice</span>  (1745&#150;1815), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born of foreign parentage in Devon. His father, normally resident in London, was a merchant dealing principally in wine from France and Portugal. Educated at the University of Geneva, Margarot entered the family business, travelling in the West Indies and Portugal, where he owned some property. It is possible that he had developed some sympathy for radical politics through his father, who is reported to have made his home a centre for radical Wilkites during the 1760s and 1770s. At the beginning of the French Revolution, Margarot was resident in France; when he returned to England early in 1792 he joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42297/', "London Corresponding Society (LCS)")</script>. Margarot's education and undoubted ability ensured his prominence, and, although he expressed some initial nervousness that too public an involvement with the society might damage his business with London merchants, on 3 May 1792 he was elected chairman of the society's general committee. As chairman he shared the administrative load with Thomas Hardy, the secretary, and while Margarot appears to have been the author of some of the significant addresses, the two signed jointly the more important correspondence, addresses, and proclamations. At a general meeting held in the open air at Chalk Farm on 24 October 1793, Margarot was chosen, together with Joseph Gerrald, to represent the society at the Edinburgh convention. The United Political Societies of Norwich also selected Margarot as their representative and agreed to share his expenses with the LCS.<br>
<br>The radicals in Scotland were reeling from the severe sentences imposed on two of their principal spokesmen, Thomas Muir and the Revd Thomas Fyshe Palmer. The Edinburgh convention had already met, briefly, before Margarot and Gerrald arrived, accompanied by another two delegates from different English societies. It reconvened to discuss proposals for constitutional and parliamentary reform, and the proceedings were dominated by Margarot, Gerrald, and the Scot William Skirving, who acted as secretary. On 6 December 1793 the Edinburgh authorities decided to close the proceedings; Margarot, Gerrald, and Skirving were charged with sedition. Recognizing that there was little chance of acquittal Margarot and Gerrald used their trials, in the following January and March, to express their political ideology. They were duly sentenced to fourteen years' transportation.<br>
<br>Awaiting transportation in Portsmouth, Margarot sought to settle business matters and arrange his wife's passage to New South Wales as a free settler. He also continued to correspond with popular radicals. One particular letter, to the societies in Norwich, speaking of a possible French landing, urged his readers not to relax &#145;in the Cause of Freedom&#146;. It was subsequently reprinted, with emphasis, in the second report from the House of Commons committee of secrecy investigating treasonable activity later in the year.<br>
<br>The <i>Surprize</i>, the transport taking Margarot and the other &#145;Scottish Martyrs&#146; (Muir, Palmer, Gerrald, and Skirving) to New South Wales, set sail on 2 May 1794. While at sea there was trouble on board; a group of convicts, including Palmer and Skirving, allegedly sought to kill the captain and crew and take over the ship. Palmer's account, <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Sufferings of T. F. Palmer and W. Skirving</span> (1797), accused Margarot of exposing the plot to the captain and thus being the cause of the brutal punishment inflicted on Palmer and Skirving. Many contemporaries accepted this version, though Francis Place, investigating the charges after Margarot's death, concluded that the events were not as Palmer described; more recent research, which has highlighted Margarot's continuing radicalism, tends to confirm Place's opinion. He may have been vain and financially lax, but there seems little reason to doubt his genuine passion for reform and social justice.<br>
<br>As a political prisoner in New South Wales, Margarot was allowed considerable liberty. He and his wife took a small cottage with a garden, and from here he commenced a campaign against the profiteering in the colony by military officers and certain privileged individuals, notably Palmer, who had invested in a stock of rum before his transportation. Margarot began a lengthy correspondence with the colonial authorities in London outlining various proposals for reform, but no action was taken. Possibly he was involved in the convict rebellion of 1804. The following year he was moved from Botany Bay to Norfolk Island, thence to Van Diemen's Land, and then in 1806 to Newcastle. He eventually returned to England in mid-1810, protesting that his criticism of the corruption in the colony had led to his period of transportation being extended by two years.<br>
<br>Back in England, and in financial difficulties, Margarot demanded that the Home Office return money bills left in the care of Thomas Hardy which had been impounded when the latter was arrested for treason in 1794. This demand was successful, but his claims for compensation for the additional two years' exile, for the fact that his wife had not been treated as a free settler, and for the seizure of his private papers in Australia were dismissed. In 1812 he gave evidence on corruption to the House of Commons inquiry into the transportation system. At the same time he continued his enthusiasm for reform, urging a restoration of the Saxon constitution, the curtailing of commerce, and a redistribution of land with a plot for every family. He spent the summers of 1813 and 1814 in France endeavouring to re-establish his old business. He died in London on 11 November 1815 and was buried in St Pancras's churchyard. Thomas Hardy and other members of the defunct LCS organized a subscription for his widow which grew to nearly &pound;200.<br>
