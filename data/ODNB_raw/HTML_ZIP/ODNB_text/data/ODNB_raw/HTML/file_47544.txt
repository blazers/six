<span class="headword">Campbell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Black]</span>,  Janet <span class="st"> [Jessie]</span></span>  (1827&#150;1907), <span class="occ">promoter of higher education for women in Scotland</span>, was born in Cross-Arthurlie, Renfrewshire, on 26 March 1827, the eldest child of James Black (1799?&#150;1831) of Cross-Arthurlie, the owner of a bleaching business, and his wife, Eliza Taylor (1803?&#150;1859) of Balgray House, Newton Mearns, Renfrewshire. One brother, Charles, died in 1832 and the other, James (1831?&#150;1853), died in Trinidad, West Indies. On 21 April 1846 she married James Campbell (1823&#150;1902) of Tullichewan, Dunbartonshire, a merchant and a principal of the firm of J. and W. Campbell &amp; Co., warehousemen (wholesale drapers), Ingram Street, Glasgow; they had five children, three daughters and two sons. Her husband was a cousin of Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Staunch members of the Free Church of Scotland, they attended Alexandria North United Free Church.<br>
<br>Jessie Campbell was described as a lady with great intellectual gifts who identified herself with the various movements, social and intellectual, in which her husband was interested, such as the poor, education, and music. However, the movement for the higher education of women was her own cause. She recognized the need of women for education beyond school age, and desired to obtain for them educational advantages similar to those offered by universities to men. In 1868 she proposed that lectures for women be given by professors of Glasgow University. The first to respond were John Young, professor of natural history, Edward Caird (moral philosophy), John Nichol (English literature), and Robert Grant (astronomy). These lectures, given in the university and in the corporation galleries, were very successful and continued until 1877, when the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women was formed to offer women opportunities of study at university level. Jessie Campbell became vice-president of the new association and Janet Galloway its honorary secretary. Lecture courses were offered with tutorial classes, set written work, and examinations. With Jessie Campbell at the helm the association thrived. It offered an ever-increasing range of courses while continuing to petition for the equal entry of women into Scottish universities.<br>
<br>In 1883 the association was incorporated as Queen Margaret College, and Jessie Campbell became its vice-president and chaired its executive committee. The new college required a building and secure financial resources, tasks which she took on with relish. She persuaded an old friend, Isabella Elder, to purchase North Park House for the college, and was the main fund-raiser of the &pound;20,000 endowment fund, appealing to the wealthy merchants and industrialists of Glasgow. Queen Margaret College, which was the only college for the higher education of women in Scotland, amalgamated with Glasgow University in 1892 after the Scottish universities commissioners issued an ordinance empowering Scottish universities to make provision for the instruction and graduation of women. Affiliation with Glasgow University had always been one of the aims of Queen Margaret College, but following its dissolution Jessie Campbell led an action to ensure that women retained some share in the management of the women's department of the university, which the college became. The issue was sidelined, and in 1893 Mrs Campbell retired from active involvement in the higher education of women in Scotland. Glasgow University awarded her an honorary LLD in 1901 in recognition of her pioneering work. She contributed an article, &#145;The rise of the higher education of women movement in Glasgow&#146;, to <span class="italic">The book of the jubilee: in commemoration of the ninth jubilee of the University of Glasgow, 1451&#150;1901</span> (1901). Jessie Campbell died at her home at Broomley, Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, on 10 February 1907, and was buried four days later in the family vault at Alexandria cemetery.<br>
