<span class="headword">Ua Ruairc,  Tigern&aacute;n</span> <span class="st"> [Tiernan O'Rourke]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1172), <span class="occ">king of Br&eacute;ifne</span>, was the son of &Aacute;ed, king of Br&eacute;ifne (<i>d</i>. 1122), and is first mentioned as king of Br&eacute;ifne in 1124. His mother was Aillend, daughter of Ua Ba&iacute;gell&aacute;in of Fir Manach, who was also mother of Donnchad Ua Cerbaill, king of Airgialla (<i>d</i>. 1168), with whom he later competed to expand into the area of what is now co. Louth.<br>
<br>In 1125 Ua Ruairc submitted to Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht, contender for the high-kingship, and effective overlord of Ireland, who deposed Murchad Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn, king of Mide (<i>d</i>. 1153), and allocated a quarter-portion of Mide to him. Eight years later, however, in 1133, Ua Ruairc took part in a grand alliance against Ua Conchobair, fighting alongside Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn and destroying the bridge and castle at Athlone. In 1137 he and Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn placed a fleet of between 140 and 200 ships on the River Shannon at Lough Ree, against Ua Conchobair. In the next year, however, Ua Ruairc switched his support back to Ua Conchobair, while Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn concluded an alliance with Diarmait Mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and the Hiberno-Norse of Dublin. After renewed conflict Ua Conchobair divided east Mide between Mac Murchada and Ua Ruairc in 1144.<br>
<br>In a further political shift, Ua Ruairc in 1149 submitted to Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, king of T&iacute;r Eoghain, a rising power and contender for the high-kingship against Ua Conchobair; and the following year Mac Lochlainn effected a tripartite division of Mide between Ua Conchobair, Ua Ruairc, and Donnchad Ua Cerbaill, king of Airgialla. In 1152 Mac Lochlainn, having concluded an alliance with Ua Conchobair and Mac Murchada, invaded Br&eacute;ifne and temporarily deposed Ua Ruairc from the kingship in favour of a collateral, &Aacute;ed, son of Gilla Braite Ua Ruairc (<i>d</i>. 1176). It was on this occasion that Mac Murchada carried off Ua Ruairc's wife, Derbforgaill (<i>d</i>. 1193), daughter of Murchad Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn, as a calculated political insult. Ua Ruairc was restored by Ua Conchobair, who in 1153 led an army into Leinster which brought Derbforgaill back to Br&eacute;ifne. Nevertheless, Mac Lochlainn &#145;compelled the men of Br&eacute;ifne to submit to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann&aacute;la r&iacute;oghachta &Eacute;ireann</span>, s.a. 1154). In 1156 Ua Ruairc negotiated a peace with Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair; but following the latter's death, he was defeated at Liss Luigdi, Meath, by Mac Murchada, accompanied by the Hiberno-Norse of Dublin.<br>
<br>Ua Ruairc attended the consecration of the church of Mellifont in 1157, a ceremony which endorsed the high-kingship of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn and at which Derbforgaill donated gold, altar cloths, and vessels. In 1159 Ua Ruairc swore mutual oaths with Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, who had succeeded his father, Toirdelbach, as king of Connacht in 1156 and who married Ua Ruairc's daughter Dub Coblaid (<i>d</i>. 1181); the two then hosted together against Mac Lochlainn, who retaliated by attempting to expel Ua Ruairc from Mide. The next year, when Mac Lochlainn sought hostages from Ua Ruairc, Ua Conchobair led an army to support his ally. One of Ua Ruairc's sons, M&aacute;elsechlainn, was killed in 1162 and another, Sitric, in 1165 in renewed warfare between the men of Mide and of Br&eacute;ifne. In 1166 he hosted with Ua Conchobair to Dublin city, which submitted, and into Leinster against Diarmait Mac Murchada, on whom they inflicted a defeat. While Ua Conchobair moved on to campaign in T&iacute;r Conaill, Ua Ruairc's army, probably as part of a co-ordinated strategy, invaded T&iacute;r Eoghain, where Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn was routed and killed. Ua Ruairc then returned to Leinster and drove Mac Murchada into exile, ostensibly in vengeance for the abduction of his wife. In 1167, following Mac Murchada's return, Ua Conchobair and Ua Ruairc hosted into Leinster and obliged him to submit to Ua Conchobair as high-king and pay 100 ounces of gold to Ua Ruairc in compensation for his wife's abduction.<br>
<br>Two years later, in 1169, Ua Conchobair apportioned the eastern half of Mide to Ua Ruairc, retaining the western half himself. Ua Ruairc subsequently accompanied Ua Conchobair to Leinster where hostages were taken from Mac Murchada, who, his forces augmented by additional Norman mercenaries, then raided in Mide and Br&eacute;ifne and secured the submission of east Mide. As Mac Murchada's position strengthened, Ua Ruairc made his acknowledgement of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair's high-kingship conditional on the execution of the hostages whom Ua Conchobair held from Mac Murchada. Following Mac Murchada's death about May 1171, Ua Ruairc hosted with Ua Conchobair to besiege the Anglo-Norman garrison in Dublin and, in an engagement with Miles de Cogan, Ua Ruairc's son (and almost certainly his successor designate), &Aacute;ed Manach, was killed. At Christmas 1171 Ua Ruairc submitted to Henry II at Dublin. He was killed by Hugh de Lacy at Tlachtga (Hill of Ward, Meath) in 1172, a rival dynast, Domnall, son of Annach Ua Ruairc, being in the company of Lacy; the dead man was decapitated, his head fixed on a gate of Dublin city, and his body hung by the feet from a gibbet. &Aacute;ed, son of Gilla Braite Ua Ruairc, succeeded him as king.<br>
<br>Tigern&aacute;n Ua Ruairc was involved in partitions of Mide in 1124, 1144, 1150, and 1169 and his designation by Gerald of Wales as &#145;king of the men of Mide&#146; reflected his expansion into Meath, where he erected bases at Kells (to the church of which he made grants of land, recorded in the <span class="roman">Book of Kells</span>) and Slane. His encroachments into Meath were the real source of the tension between himself and Mac Murchada which occasioned the abduction of Derbforgaill, as Mac Murchada sought to extend the borders of Leinster into the same area. Ua Ruairc's territorial expansion was reflected at the Synod of Kells in 1152, when the dioceses of Br&eacute;ifne (later Kilmore), with a see at Kells, and of Ardagh were created, the latter coterminous with his sub-kingdom of Conmaicne. Despite Ua Ruairc's shifting alliances between claimants for the high-kingship, Diarmait Mac Murchada remained his constant and implacable enemy. The sizeable overkingship of Br&eacute;ifne which he had assembled, extending from the mouth of the Erne to the mouth of the Boyne, collapsed following his death; his conquests in Meath came under the control of Hugh de Lacy; and the see of Kells was extinguished and absorbed into the Anglo-Norman diocese of Meath.<br>
