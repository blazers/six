<span class="headword">Gubiun <span class="st"> [Gibuin]</span>,  Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1151), <span class="occ">abbot of St Albans</span>, was probably born towards the end of the eleventh century. According to Matthew Paris he was an Englishman, although his name would suggest Norman origins  (<span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>, 106). Two contradictory versions of Gubiun's early career are given in the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>. According to the first he joined the community as a youth, and distinguished himself in the production of books in the scriptorium before entering the service of Alexander, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1148), where he remained until becoming abbot. In the second and more plausible account he entered the bishop's service as a secular and rose to the position of chamberlain and bishop's chaplain before leaving to begin life as a monk at St Albans, at the bishop's suggestion. At Lincoln he studied the <span class="roman">Bible</span> under an Italian, Master Wodo; his experiences of intellectual life and book production there may explain both the close relationship between the abbey and the see, and the appearance of several Italian scholars at St Albans in the 1150s.<br>
<br>Gubiun probably entered St Albans in the 1130s. He rose quickly to prominence (though not perhaps as a copyist), and was elected abbot in 1146. Although he made several notable improvements during his short abbacy, expanding the abbey buildings, increasing the community's wealth, and securing the confirmation of the abbey's privileges from Pope Eugenius III (<i>r</i>. 1145&#150;1153), he attracted bitter criticism, probably for his close association with, and apparent subjection to, Lincoln. He was also held responsible for the loss of some of the monks' most precious vestments, and for the degradation of the shrine of St Alban, which was robbed of costly gold decorations added by the previous abbot, Geoffrey. Matthew Paris also suggests that he became drawn into a conflict with the prior, Alcuin, who was driven as a result to join Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>In his fourth or fifth year as abbot Gubiun fell sick and resigned the abbacy in favour of Robert of Gorham, the nephew of his predecessor Geoffrey. He died on 6 July 1151, and was buried at the entrance to the chapter house of St Albans Abbey. His remains were exhumed in 1979 and reburied, together with those of other twelfth-century abbots including Geoffrey, at the west end of the nave.<br>
<br>Matthew Paris describes Gubiun as a &#145;lover of books&#146;, and he was probably the author of, among other works, a history of Alexander the Great. Compiled from the work of a wide range of classical authors, including Solinus and Pompeius Trogus, the text includes as much topographical as historical detail. Two copies of his history survive, both perhaps transcribed at St Albans in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. The text was used in the fourteenth century by the chronicler Ranulf Higden (<i>d</i>. 1364), and by the St Albans historian Thomas Walsingham (<i>d</i>. 1422) for his own <span class="italic">Historia Alexandri magni</span>.<br>
