<span class="headword">Palliser,  John</span>  (1817&#150;1887), <span class="occ">geographer and explorer</span>, was born on 29 January 1817, the eldest of five sons born to Wray Palliser (<i>d</i>. 1862) of Comragh, co. Waterford, sometime lieutenant-colonel of the Waterford militia, and Anne, daughter of John Gledstanes of Annesfift, co. Tipperary; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21168/', "Sir William Palliser")</script> was his younger brother. John Palliser was sheriff of Waterford in 1844 and served in the Waterford militia. In 1847 he went on a hunting expedition among the native people of western and north-western America and his <span class="italic">Adventures of a Hunter in the Prairies</span> (1853) sold at least eight thousand copies. In 1856 he proposed to the Royal Geographical Society that he explore the Canadian prairies and continental divide. The society's expedition committee refined his aims to comprise tracing the course of the Southern Saskatchewan, evaluating the region for settlement, and exploring the Rockies for a southerly pass to British Columbia. They estimated that this would take two years and cost &pound;5000. Roderick Murchison, president of the society, stressed in his submission of the plan to the Colonial Office that there was a possibility that coal would be discovered and that a British expedition would be timely given the United States' railway surveys in the far west. In 1857 Henry Labouchere, secretary of state for the colonies, agreed to support the expedition. The Treasury subscribed &pound;5000 and the Royal Society advised on the scientific aspects of the journey; but more important than science were the strategic desires to counteract American infiltration of the British prairies, to develop transport routes to stop the Red River colony looking south rather than east for links to the outside world, and to review the activities of the Hudson's Bay Company which was widely criticized for maintaining the isolation of the Pacific west and understating its resource endowment in order to protect its own trading privileges. It was in part Palliser's aloofness from the political controversy surrounding the venture that led, on 31 March 1857, to his appointment as leader of the expedition, supported by Thomas Blakiston as astronomer and James Hector as geologist and zoologist.<br>
<br>The expedition had assumed a far more scientific and political character than Palliser had originally envisaged, and became even more highly charged politically after gold was discovered on the Fraser River in 1858. In 1857 Palliser explored the White Fish and Kaminstikwia rivers and the land between the Southern Saskatchewan and the border with the United States, and confirmed the feasibility of establishing communication, particularly a railway line, between the rocky regions of lakes Superior and Winnipeg and the prairies. In 1858 he approached the Rockies from the Buffalo prairie between the Northern and Southern Saskatchewan and explored the passes through the mountains lying in British territory. For the results of this journey he was awarded the patron's gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1859. In 1860 he headed for the Southern Saskatchewan River following the course of the Red Deer River. He went westwards to the Rocky Mountains from the point where he had turned in his first season's explorations and thus completed the survey of the hitherto unknown prairie region. He also examined the country to the west of the Columbia River, establishing the fact that there was a route connecting the Saskatchewan plains east of the Rockies with the gold mining regions of British Columbia&#151;information which was vital in the struggle to establish British control over areas which were attracting more American than Canadian prospectors. Palliser considered that western North America should form a series of British colonies independent of Canada&#151;an idea which proved unworkable; and that the Hudson's Bay Company should have its privileges curtailed&#151;a view which prevailed soon afterwards.<br>
<br>As the government sponsors of the expedition feared, its actual cost of &pound;13,000 was nearly three times the original estimate; yet much had been achieved for costs far more modest than those spent on the United States' side in surveying western lands. The general topography of a huge swathe of territory had been established, the first accurate map of the British Rocky Mountains drawn, several passes discovered, and substantial knowledge gained about the geology and natural history of the area. On 30 May 1877 Palliser was awarded the companionship of St Michael and St George. He died, unmarried, at Comragh, co. Waterford, on 18 August 1887.<br>
