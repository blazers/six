<span class="headword">Duckworth,  (David) Keith</span>  (1933&#150;2005), <span class="occ">automotive engineer</span>, was born at 112 Accrington Road, Blackburn, Lancashire, on 10 August 1933, the son of Frank Duckworth, a textile engineer who also sold cotton cloth on the Manchester cotton exchange, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hardman, a cooker demonstrator in electricity board showrooms. Following his education at Giggleswick, a boarding school in Yorkshire, Duckworth joined the Royal Air Force as a national serviceman. He undertook pilot training, moving from Tiger Moths to Chipmunks and then to twin-engine Oxfords. Eventually he was rejected as a pilot as he fell asleep in the cockpit during a night training flight owing to an allergy to medication he was taking for an ankle injury. Nevertheless his conduct was considered incompetent and dangerous. Subsequently he was offered training as an RAF navigator, but owing to differences of opinion with his navigational instructor the RAF released him. (Later in life he succeeded in gaining a helicopter pilot's licence.) Immediately he took up a place at Imperial College, London, to study engineering. He obtained, as he fully anticipated, only a pass degree, as his dissertation comprised primarily a critique of his BSc course, its content, and methodology.<br>
<br>Duckworth's interest in practical engineering dated back to his childhood and he was encouraged by his father, who provided him with a lathe, a vertical drill, and a grinder. He made model steam and aero engines and won local popularity for dealing with the neighbours' mechanical and electrical malfunctions. It was at university that his fellow undergraduates introduced him to motor racing, and he bought a sports kit car from Colin Chapman, which after three outings he crashed at Goodwood. During his student holidays he found employment in Chapman's gear and transmission department at Lotus's factory in Hornsey, which at that time was headed by the racing driver Graham Hill. It was there that he met Mike Costin, who was to become his business partner. On Hill's departure from the company in 1957 Duckworth succeeded him in charge of gearbox engineering. Almost immediately he pointed out the deficiencies in Chapman's product and left the firm.<br>
<br>In 1958 Duckworth joined forces with Mike Costin and established Cosworth Engineering, with an authorized original capital of &pound;100. Duckworth focused on design and Costin on engineering development. The new firm was depicted as a no-frills operation, and its first premises were in Shaftesbury Mews before it moved to rat-infested premises at Friern Barnet and then on to Edmonton in 1961, before finally moving to a purpose-built complex in Northamptonshire in 1964. On 10 January 1959, at All Saints' Church, Carshalton, Surrey, Duckworth married (Dorothy) Ursula Cassal, the 22-year-old daughter of Charles Victor Cassal, electrical engineer. They had a son, Roger, and a daughter, Tricia.<br>
<br>Duckworth had been aware of the potential of the Ford 10E 1100 engine that powered the Ford Anglia saloon, and began experimenting. The firm's big break came in 1965 when Colin Chapman and Walter Hayes, public relations director of Ford, persuaded Sir Patrick Hennessy, chairman of Ford of Britain, to fund the design and manufacture of a new 3 litre formula one car, a category that was due to be launched on the racing circuit the following year. In essence, for the cost of &pound;100,000, this brought Duckworth, Ford, and Lotus together. Rather than work in the factory, Duckworth designed the new engine in the quietness of his own home, losing forty pounds in weight in the process. The initial outcome was a four cylinder, 1600 cc formula two engine from which was developed the V8 Cosworth&#150;Ford DFV (double four valve). Production of this new engine was timely for British motor racing, as it had been announced that Coventry Climax would no longer produce racing engines. The DFV changed the face of formula one racing in that, following Jim Clark's victory in a DFV-powered Lotus in the Dutch grand prix in 1967, it and its subsequent derivatives went on to dominate formula one racing down to 1983, winning 155 events. It was also used in formula two, three, and junior races with considerable success, and DFV-engined cars won the Le Mans twenty-four-hour race and several American speedway races. The key to the engine's success lay in Duckworth's precision in the use of a narrow angle, four-valve-per-cylinder, twin overhead camshaft cylinder head layout, which other firms had to acquire or develop themselves to remain competitive. More important, this was an off-the-shelf engine that was sold to independent firms like Brabham, Tyrrell, McLaren, Hesketh, and Wolf. It contributed significantly to the repeated success of such British racing drivers as Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill, and James Hunt.<br>
<br>Duckworth suffered a heart attack in 1973, which ultimately resulted in bypass surgery in 1987. As he owned 85 per cent of the company, his failing health and the prospect of crippling death duties persuaded him in 1980 to sell his interest in the business to United Engineering, and soon after he gave up his chairmanship of the company in favour of Mike Costin and retired to live in his hilltop house, Buckby Folly, in the village of East Haddon, Northamptonshire. His first marriage having ended in divorce in January 1986, on 18 April that year he married Gillian Mary (Gill) Reeve, the 43-year-old daughter of Thomas Francis Cockerill, farmer.<br>
<br>A bluff Lancastrian, Duckworth &#145;could always be relied upon to upset an otherwise tranquil discussion with one incisive comment&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Dec 2005). He also enjoyed a talent for conjuring up pithy phrases and aphorisms, which became popular throughout the world of formula one racing and were known as Duckworthisms. He died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at Northampton General Hospital on 18 December 2005, leaving an estate valued at over &pound;10 million. He was survived by his wife, Gill, and the two children of his first marriage.<br>
