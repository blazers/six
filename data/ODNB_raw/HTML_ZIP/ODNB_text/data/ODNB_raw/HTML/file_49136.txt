<span class="headword">Campbell,  Herbert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Herbert Edward Story]</span>  (1844&#150;1904), <span class="occ">music-hall performer</span>, was born on 22 December 1844 at 16 Hamilton Street, Kennington, Surrey, the son of Henry George Story, smith, and his wife, Hannah Fisher. Little is known of his early life beyond the agitation which resulted whenever Henry Story attended his firm's annual outing. This &#145;excellent husband and devoted father&#146; would return full of gin and cockles and bash the furniture to bits with a poker, with Mrs Story yelling murder, the children screaming&#151;&#145;and household bread at a shilling a quartern&#146;  (Booth, 115). The domestic observation and philosophical tag-line reflected Campbell's comic style.<br>
<br>Herbert Story started work as a messenger at <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, and made his first stage appearance at a teetotal hall in Clerkenwell, London, &#145;singing for ginger-beer and buns&#146;  (Thorn). He became a fan of Raynor's Original Christy Minstrels and, while working at a Woolwich gun factory, formed his own &#145;amateur nigger band&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 22 Sept 1888). During the 1860s he became a professional &#145;bone corner&#146;&#151;the bone-playing minstrel at the end of the row. After a disastrous booking in Oxford, Campbell (as he had now become) had to walk back to London. He later joined the minstrel performers Harmon and Elston but, finding his talents undervalued, abandoned burnt cork and gave his first solo performance at the Raglan Music-Hall, south London, at &pound;3 a week. On 20 April 1867 he married Elizabeth Ann Mills (1848/9&#150;1884), of Hoxton, London, and struggled to establish himself without a blacked-up face. Finally his cockney style caught on and in 1871 he made his first pantomime appearance in <span class="italic">King Winter</span> at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool. He was re-engaged the following year, but soon became a favourite with London pantomime audiences at the Grecian Theatre, Shoreditch.<br>
<br>In 1882 Augustus Harris (Druriolanus), the lessee of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, set Campbell on an uninterrupted run of pantomime success there that was to last until his death twenty-two years later. From 1889 he was joined every year by Dan Leno, and their partnership became the most celebrated in pantomime history. Its appeal owed much to their contrasting styles. Leno was small and whimsical with quicksilver movements, Campbell a 19 stone colossus with a voice like &#145;a powerful accordeon which some miracle-worker had got into tune&#146;  (Shaw). Beerbohm thought of Campbell as &#145;the offspring of some mystical union between beef and thunder&#146; and took French visitors to see him &#145;as a liberal education in the character of this island&#146;  (Beerbohm). He often played a greedy boy or matron of a certain age, his enormous frame alternately filling blouse and breeches or an outsize frock. His only surviving film appearance shows him in the former guise guzzling a pudding, his broad features alight with gluttony. Campbell's accent was lustily cockney&#151;Shaw begged him to stop pronouncing &#145;slave&#146; as &#145;slive&#146; in <span class="italic">Aladdin</span>  (Shaw)&#151;and his humour was &#145;rich, broad and pleasantly devoid of subtlety&#146;, but he had an &#145;extraordinary capacity for thinking out new moves for the nose, lips and eyes to portray all the human emotions without uttering a word&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 23 July 1904). Some critics felt music-hall was corrupting pantomime but the public regarded the Drury Lane spectaculars as the pinnacle of Christmas entertainment (even when the two stars took a few nights to polish their improvisations).<br>
<br>In his solo career Campbell bridged the old order and the new, having seen the halls with their presiding chairmen give way to palatial variety houses. True to the earlier style, he based his act on comic songs; only Marie Lloyd had more in her repertoire  (Kilgarriff, 140&#150;42). On the four records Campbell made late in life he is the cockney John Bull, but he showed his satirical streak in a parody of the song &#145;We don't want to fight&#146; (which gave &#145;jingoism&#146; to the language). In place of the bellicose original he declared he would &#145;let the Russians have Constantinople&#146;. In &#145;The Great McNoodle&#146; he lampooned Sir John McDougall, a London county councillor who opposed music-hall, while the song &#145;In my fust 'usband's time&#146; mocked the aesthetic movement:<blockquote>
<div>For we didn't think an old cracked pot intense,<br>
</div>
<div>Nor an old blue plate sublime.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Popular sentiment came in for caustic treatment when he turned &#145;The Miner's Dream of Home&#146; into a family horror-story:<blockquote>
<div>My pa was boozing nightly,<br>
</div>
<div>And my mother was shifting the gin,<br>
</div>
<div>And the lodger was taking the old girl out,<br>
</div>
<div>And the old man in.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Campbell's own domestic arrangements were unconventional. Mrs Campbell having died in 1884, he lived as man and wife with an actress who had been Rose Wiltshire (<i>c</i>.1858&#150;1891). After her death a third &#145;Mrs Campbell&#146;, in reality (Ellen) Maud Bartram, a licensee, became his companion until he died. Campbell was president of the Music Hall Sick Fund, vice-president of the Music Hall Artistes' Railway Association, and a freemason. In 1898 he, Leno, and two fellow comedians built the Granville Theatre, in Fulham. At the opening Campbell said that when he should go off &#145;to Peckham Rye&#146; (die) there would now be something to keep his memory green  (Read, 225). The quartet ran three other halls but lost money against stiff competition from bigger proprietors. Fond of company, Campbell always referred to his favoured glass of whisky as &#145;a cup of tea&#146;  (Randle, 178). By 1904 he was considering retirement when, after another triumph in <span class="italic">Humpty-Dumpty</span>, he and Leno died within months of each other. Campbell's stentorian tones were the indirect cause of his death. As he alighted from his brougham, his instructions to the coachman startled the horse, which reared and knocked him over. A bruised leg became ulcerous, causing septicaemia, and he died on 19 July from a brain haemorrhage, at 28 Quadrant Road, Islington. He was fifty-nine. At his funeral three days later the route to Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, was lined by so many mourners that traffic had to be diverted. &#145;Much we marvelled at him,&#146; wrote Beerbohm, &#145;yet marvelling, much loved him&#146;  (Beerbohm). The irregular home life became public when his &#145;will&#146; was contested in 1905. Claiming that Campbell had signed the original in the billiard-room of the Royal Music-Hall, Holborn, and then lost it, a commission agent produced a draft leaving the assets (&pound;4477) to Maud Bartram and her niece. Campbell's relatives disputed the story, but the judge ruled that he would not have left his companion unprovided for.<br>
