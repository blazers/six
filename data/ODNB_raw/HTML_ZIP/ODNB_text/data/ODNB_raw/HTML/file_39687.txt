<span class="headword">Bernard, Sir  Robert</span>, fifth baronet  (1740&#150;1789), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born early in 1740 at Brampton Park, Huntingdonshire, the only son and second child of Sir John Bernard, fourth baronet (1685&#150;1766), of Brampton, a gentleman farmer, and Mary, daughter and coheir of Sir Francis St John, first baronet, of Longthorpe, Northamptonshire. The Bernard family had lived in Huntingdonshire for decades and acquired the family estate at Brampton Park in 1666. The first baronet, Sir Robert Bernard (<i>d</i>. 1666), was recorder of Huntingdon and served the borough in the House of Commons. Despite their support for the parliamentary cause in the civil war, the Bernards apparently remained faithful Anglicans. Robert Bernard was educated at Westminster School, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 May 1758.<br>
<br>Bernard continued the family's interest in politics when he stood successfully for a county parliamentary seat in 1765 made available by the retirement of Lord Charles Greville Montagu. Because the Bernards were historically allied with the Montagu family, Bernard was nominated to the seat by George Montagu, fourth duke and seventh earl of Manchester. He soon affiliated with the parliamentary whig faction led by the marquess of Rockingham. In December 1766 he succeeded his father as fifth baronet. During his term in the House of Commons, he rarely spoke, although he voted for measures advanced by the Rockingham and Chatham ministries. According to the other Huntingdonshire political power, John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, Bernard became attracted to the reform notions of William Petty, second earl of Shelburne, although no correspondence between the two exists in the Shelburne papers. Bernard quarrelled with the duke of Manchester in late 1766, which caused a breach between the two. At the election of 1768 Bernard spent considerable sums campaigning for re-election against two candidates backed by Manchester and Sandwich, but lost by 138 votes.<br>
<br>Bernard travelled to London in 1769, where he joined supporters of the radical reformer John Wilkes, imprisoned for outlawry and denied a seat in parliament from Middlesex. When the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73620', "Society of Gentleman Supporters of the Bill of Rights")</script> was founded to collect funds for Wilkes, Bernard became a charter member. Later in 1769 Bernard assisted John Calcraft, Chathamite MP, and the Surrey distiller Sir Joseph Mawbey in soliciting funds for the society in Essex. When a vacancy occurred in the parliamentary borough of Westminster in 1770, Wilkes's radical party persuaded Bernard to stand for the seat. Nominated by William Dowdeswell, Rockingham's leader in the Commons, Bernard was elected without opposition. Once again, however, he maintained a low profile, making only one speech attacking stock jobbing in the next parliament. A petition signed by several thousand Westminster constituents concerning Wilkes's Middlesex election dispute was presented to George III by Bernard in November 1770. Reportedly, Bernard refused to kneel in the presence of the king.<br>
<br>Bernard's close confidant in the Bill of Rights Society, John Horne, precipitated a split with Wilkes over the use of the society's funds. Bernard joined Horne, John Sawbridge, and others by leaving the society to form the Constitutional Society in March 1771. The decision to oppose Wilkes led to Bernard's failure to win nomination for the Westminster seat at the next election in 1774. Meanwhile, Bernard co-operated with Horne and Sawbridge in opposing the powerful borough patron, the duke of Bedford. The reformers hoped their campaign would inspire a general revolt against the electoral influence of powerful patrons such as Bedford. The mayor of Bedford, one Cawne, agreed to admit into the corporation Huntingdonshire and London associates of Bernard's as non-resident freemen. When the duke of Bedford died in 1771, the corporation gave the duke's post of recorder to Bernard, and he retained this post until his death in 1789. At the 1774 elections in Bedford, Bernard's interest captured both seats, including one for his brother-in-law, Robert Sparrow. The administration of Frederick, Lord North, was able to remove Sparrow from the Commons when the election was challenged by Samuel Whitbread. Bernard's faction held the other Bedford seat in the 1780 and 1784 elections, however.<br>
<br>At the same time that Bernard became heavily involved in Bedford politics, he joined Christopher Wyvill's association movement for parliamentary reform in 1780. As chairman of the Huntingdonshire association, Bernard circulated Wyvill's petition for shorter parliaments and reapportionment of seats based on population shifts. Bernard also helped to organize the petitioning movement in neighbouring Cambridgeshire. Attacks of gout curtailed his activities in the mid-1780s; he died from complications of this ailment on 2 January 1789 at Brampton Park and was buried there on 7 January. Because Bernard never married, his landed property, worth &pound;14,000 (including the Huntingdonshire manors of Brampton Park, Houghton and Grafham), was left to his nephew, Robert Bernard Sparrow, the son of his sister Mary.<br>
<br>Bernard became part of the early political reform movement, mainly extra-parliamentary, in the 1760s. He demonstrated the ability to bridge the rural and urban environments to produce a national agenda for reform. A moderate by the standards of the time, Bernard agreed with more substantial reformers that the crown's influence should be diminished and that parliamentary reform was necessary to recover the historical integrity of the most important national institution. John Horne was Bernard's principal mentor once he arrived in London, yet Bernard proved capable of managing reform campaigns alone, as he did in Bedford. Typical of most early moderate reformers, Bernard represented a substantial, politically independent gentry family, whose political sensibilities recoiled in the evidence of corruption at the national as well as local levels.<br>
