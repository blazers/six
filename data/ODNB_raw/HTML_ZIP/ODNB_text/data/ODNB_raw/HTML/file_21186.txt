<span class="headword">Palmer, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1611), <span class="occ">naval commander</span>, first appears in the queen's service at sea off the coast of Flanders in 1576, which indicates that he was probably born about 1550. He was literate, but there are few other indications of his upbringing; he may, like Francis Drake, have been apprenticed to the sea. From 1580 he was a commissioner for the maintenance of Dover harbour, and was probably the Henry Palmer, esquire, who was a commissioner for concealed lands in Kent in 1581. He served under the earl of Leicester in the Netherlands, and was knighted by him in 1586, an honour that was followed by a grant of arms in the same year. In 1587 he was commanding a squadron in the narrow seas, and in 1588 was captain of the <i>Antelope</i> (300 tons) against the Armada, when he is described as the third in command under Lord Henry Seymour. It was he who obtained and organized the fireships that caused such consternation to the Spaniards off Calais, and he played a conspicuous and gallant part in the battle of Gravelines which followed. When most of the fleet was stood down on 27 August, Palmer remained in service and commanded the winter guard over the following months.<br>
<br>In July 1589 Palmer was again commanding in the channel, and in September was given the responsibility of escorting the troops that Elizabeth sent to the aid of Henri IV against the Catholic league. Further sea service is recorded twice in 1591, and he was still involved with harbour works at Dover in that year. By this time he had purchased an estate at Howletts, Bekesbourne, Kent; he first appears as a justice of the peace for Kent in 1589. His main service, however, continued to be at sea, and he took part in the blockade of Calais in 1596. This appears to have led to rumours in Spain that his head was cut off for refusing to serve against the Spaniards there; but there is no indication in the English records that he was out of favour. He appeared again upon the commission of the peace in 1593, 1594, and 1601. In July 1598 he acted as an executor for the controller of the navy, William Borough&#151;described as his cousin&#151;and he succeeded to Borough's post on 3 January 1599. He retained this position until his death, although his last recorded command at sea was in 1601.<br>
<br>Palmer married twice. His first wife was Joan, daughter and coheir of Edward Isaac, and widow of Nicholas Sidley. They had at least two sons, although only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65990/', "Henry Palmer")</script> is known to have survived his father. His second wife was Dorothy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott), widow of Thomas Hernden. He died at Bekesbourne on 20 November 1611 and was buried in the parish church, leaving modest bequests to the poor of Bekesbourne and a number of neighbouring parishes. The younger Henry was granted the reversion of his father's controllership on 17 August 1611, but did not secure the position until 1632.<br>
