<span class="headword">Williams,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gwilym Ddu o Arfon]</span>  (1738&#150;1817), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at T&#375; Mawr, Trefdraeth, Anglesey, on 1 March 1738, the son of William ap Huw ap Sion (<i>d</i>. 1773), a stonemason, and his wife, Ann Williams (<i>d</i>. 1768). After a short period at a local dame-school, he was apprenticed to a weaver but soon exchanged this for an apprenticeship with a saddler at neighbouring Llannerch-y-medd, where he remained for seven years. He was largely self-educated but through his friendship with local poets and other leaders of cultural life, especially Hugh Hughes (Y Bardd Coch), and the antiquary William Morris, he soon developed a taste for literature and Welsh antiquities. Friendship and correspondence with Robert Hughes (Robin Ddu yr Ail o F&ocirc;n) further broadened his horizons and brought him into contact with the London-Welsh society Y Gwyneddigion, of which he became a corresponding member.<br>
<br>At the conclusion of his apprenticeship as a saddler, Williams found employment as clerk to the agent at the Penrhyn estate office in Bangor, Caernarvonshire. He married Elizabeth Edmunds of Llandyg&aacute;i, Bangor, at the age of twenty-seven, and supplemented his income by keeping a saddler's shop at Llandyg&aacute;i, where his wife and daughters later kept a village grocery store, and more ambitiously by undertaking work as a surveyor of local estates; his surveys and maps of Gwenynog, Denbighshire, and of Meillionydd, Caernarvonshire, survive. He also developed his skills as an arbitrator and marketed the produce of the small slate quarries in the area. When Richard Pennant, first Baron Penrhyn, decided in 1782 to take over the running of Braich-y-cefn quarry instead of claiming rent and a levy on production, he appointed Williams to be responsible for all aspects of its development&#151;marketing, sales, transport, and bookkeeping. The newly named Penrhyn quarry became one of the largest and most successful industrial enterprises in north Wales under Williams's supervision, so that he may be regarded as one of the pioneers of the Caernarvonshire slate industry and thus a significant figure in the development of Bangor as an urban settlement. He retired on his full salary in 1803, when Penrhyn himself took on the management of the quarry.<br>
<br>Williams had long since acquired a taste for reading in both Welsh and English and he had applied himself to the study of local and more general Welsh history. He was involved in contemporary theological disputes but also found time, it appears, to read current English magazines. Upon his retirement he embarked on a new career as an author and historian producing a range of works, most of which, however, he chose not to publish. He achieved recognition as a knowledgeable antiquary and he was able to assist Benjamin Malkin in his preparations for his projected north Wales tour; Richard Fenton and Sir Richard Colt Hoare also benefited from his correspondence. Williams's work includes some theological treatises, which assert his anti-Calvinist and anti-Methodist views, and a herbal, but more important are his topographical descriptions of north Wales. His descriptions of Caernarvonshire and of Anglesey are in manuscript but his <span class="italic">Observations on the Snowdon mountains; with some account of the customs and manners of the inhabitants</span> was published in 1802. Originally intended as a private work for Lord Penrhyn, this is an interesting and well-written description of the terrain, economy, antiquities, and folklore of an area which Williams knew well. His character sketches and portrait essays of local and imagined people, which remained in manuscript during his lifetime, probably owe their inspiration to a genre popular in English. Williams's most ambitious undertaking, <span class="italic">Prydnawngwaith y Cymry</span>, was written in 1804 but was not published until 1822. This history of the Wales of the princes, from the Saxon wars to the defeat of Llywelyn in 1282, and then to the Tudor supremacy, was intended as a sequel to Theophilus Evans's <span class="italic">Drych y prif oesoedd</span> (1740). He reflects traditional Welsh historiography in his view of the defeat of Llywelyn, &#145;the last prince&#146;, in 1282, and of the putting down of subsequent rebellions, as God's just retribution for the sins of the nation. Nevertheless, his pride in noble Welsh ancestry remained unshaken and he ascribed many contemporary moral and social failures to increased English influence following the opening up of the roads and the intermarriage of Welsh gentry and the daughters of English merchants and adventurers. Equally traditional, however, was the welcome which he gave to the Tudor dynasty and to the incorporation of &#145;the remnants of the Ancient Britons&#146; with the English as a single nation enjoying the same laws and privileges&#151;a union which, Williams claimed&#151;had brought peace, security, and the blessings of reformed protestantism to a turbulent people. Williams died on 17 July 1817 at Llandyg&aacute;i, where he was later buried.<br>
