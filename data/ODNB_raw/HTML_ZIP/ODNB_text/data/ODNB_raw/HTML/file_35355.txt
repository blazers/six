<span class="headword">Paget,  Francis</span>  (1851&#150;1911), <span class="occ">bishop of Oxford</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21113/', "Sir James Paget, first baronet (1814&#150;1899)")</script>, surgeon, was born on 20 March 1851 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in his father's official residence as warden. His mother was Lydia (1815&#150;1895), youngest daughter of the Revd Henry North, and his brothers were Sir John Rahere Paget KC, Dr Henry Luke Paget, bishop-suffragan of Stepney, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35360/', "Stephen Paget FRCS")</script>. He was educated first at a private day school near Regent's Park, and then (1864&#150;9) at Shrewsbury School under Benjamin Hall Kennedy and Henry Whitehead Moss. He was elected to a junior studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1869. In 1871 he won the Hertford scholarship, the chancellor's prize for Latin verse, and a first class in classical moderations. He graduated BA with a first class in the final classical school in 1873, proceeding MA in 1876 and DD in 1885. He was elected senior student in 1873, tutor in 1876, and honorary student in 1901. Ordained deacon in 1875 and priest in 1877, he became a devoted follower of the great tractarian Edward Bouverie Pusey, who allowed him to read in the university pulpit a sermon of his which ill health prevented him from delivering himself. Other tractarian mentors included Henry Parry Liddon, Richard William Church, dean of St Paul's, and James Russell Woodford, bishop of Ely, whom Paget served as examining chaplain (1878&#150;85). Paget married Helen Beatrice Church (1858&#150;1900), Church's daughter, on 28 March 1883 at St Paul's Cathedral; Liddon officiated. Paget's eulogy of Pusey in his Bodleian Oration of 1882 earned him the foolish description of a &#145;round-collared idiot&#146; from Mark Pattison, the rector of Lincoln College. Being a witty and stimulating companion, Paget established warm friendships with younger and less conservative men of the same school, particularly during reading parties at home and abroad. Paget enjoyed his years as a tutor, and his influence over undergraduates grew as they became accustomed to a certain reserve in his manner for which he had been notable even at Shrewsbury. In 1881 Paget was appointed Oxford preacher at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall. His tutorial career ended in inauspicious circumstances. In a division in the Christ Church governing body on 15 June 1882 he voted in the majority with Pusey (who was making his last appearance in that forum) and others against the re-election of R. W. Macan, tutor in ancient history, whose views in <span class="italic">The Resurrection of Jesus Christ</span> (a publication sponsored by the nonconformist Hibbert Trust, 1877) had caused grave disquiet. There might have been dissension as to whether Paget should be elected junior censor at the last governing body of Michaelmas term, but an offer of the living of Bromsgrove (a nail making town) arrived apropos, and Paget accepted it.<br>
<br>Paget returned to Oxford in 1885, having been nominated by Gladstone to succeed Edward King, bishop of Lincoln, as regius professor of pastoral theology and canon of Christ Church. Bromsgrove had given Paget a brief insight into parochial activities and had considerably widened the range of his sympathy. Liddon's influence was counteracted by close association with younger men, and in the autumn of 1889 Paget joined Charles Gore, his successor in the see of Oxford, Henry Scott Holland, and others, in publishing the volume of essays <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span>. The authors had a common programme, to make clear that high Anglicanism was open to new knowledge [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/52464', "Lux mundi essayists")</script>]. Paget, as on other issues during his life, sought to avoid open dissension: Liddon discussed Gore's own essay (by which Liddon was deeply distressed) with Paget in Christ Church, and asked Paget not to communicate on the matter with Gore. But he did, and exchanges ensued. However, Liddon regarded Paget's own essay &#145;Sacraments&#146; as &#145;a real contribution to Christian Theology&#146;  (Johnston, 362, 367).<br>
<br>In 1892, on the resignation of Henry George Liddell, Paget was promoted by Lord Salisbury to the deanery of Christ Church. His task was difficult not least because of Liddell's success, and a certain tendency to extravagant rowdiness among the undergraduates had to be dealt with firmly. In his sixth term as dean Paget was faced by a notorious case of indiscipline: in 1893 the censors (E. F. Sampson and T. B. Strong) refused permission for undergraduates to attend a ball in November at Blenheim Palace. On the night the rope of Great Tom was cut, the dean's door painted red, and opprobrious legends (&#145;Damn Sampson&#146;, &#145;Damn the Dons&#146;) marked in the snow. One man was sent down, the &#145;funeral&#146; for his departure and other incidents being shown in a series of prints. Some acrimonious correspondence ensued in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. But Paget was not to blame for the Blenheim row, and ultimately suffered little harm from it. Estimates of his popularity vary, for &#145;he could only open out to a few&#146;, and his &#145;elaborate courtesy&#146; was apt &#145;to keep people back behind barriers of civility&#146;  (Holland, 277). But he was an anxious and capable administrator  (cf. letter from &#145;Ex Aede Christi&#146;, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Aug 1911). The deanery was more accessible than heretofore.<br>
<br>As a tutor Paget was among the early supporters of Lady Margaret Hall. As dean he took a great interest in the foundation of Reading University College, which he formally opened in 1892 and of which he was appointed visitor; Christ Church made a considerable gift of books to the new college's library and its influence was important in the early days of the new foundation. Paget was chaplain to William Stubbs, bishop of Oxford, from 1889 until the bishop's death. Thus in 1901 the cathedral and the diocese were drawn closely together, and Paget learned much of local episcopal problems. Paget's career was permanently saddened by his wife's death from meningitis at the deanery on 22 November 1900, aged forty-two.<br>
<br>In 1901, on the death of Stubbs, Dean Paget was promoted by Lord Salisbury to the bishopric of Oxford, and was consecrated on 29 June following. To the bishopric is attached the chancellorship of the Order of the Garter; Paget's most notable function in that capacity was the admission of Edward, prince of Wales, to the order at Windsor on 10 June 1911. He was also chosen as &#145;supporter&#146; bishop at their coronations by both Queen Alexandra in 1902 and Queen Mary in 1911. His administration of the diocese of Oxford was marked by the same anxious care which he had devoted to his college. He was eager to do everything himself; much of the episcopal correspondence was written in his own clear but characteristic handwriting. It took some time for the people to feel that they knew him intimately, although his pastoral earnestness was keenly appreciated by the inhabitants of the rural villages, which, from 1907, he was able to visit in the episcopal automobile. Early in 1903 he declined Arthur Balfour's offer of the see of Winchester. In April 1904 he became a member of the royal commission on ecclesiastical discipline, and signed its report on 21 June 1906. He was one of the three out of fourteen members who attended each of the 118 sittings, and he exhibited &#145;a genius for fairness towards hostile witnesses&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 July 1906) and a remarkable gift for fusing opinions in the drafting of the report; Archbishop Davidson thought he was &#145;at his best&#146; on this commission. His attitude to prevailing excesses in ritual was shown in the charge which he began to deliver to his diocese on 8 October 1906, and by the action which he took against the Revd Oliver Partridge Henly, vicar of Wolverton St Mary, in respect of &#145;reservation&#146; and &#145;benediction&#146;. The case was taken to the court of arches  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 and 21 July 1909); the vicar, who was deprived, obtained employment in another diocese, and afterwards joined the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Paget sought to provide for a subdivision of the diocese, a difficult objective not achieved nearly a century later. For this purpose he made a vain endeavour to dispose of Cuddesdon Palace. In July 1910 he showed his active zeal for the wider work of the church by becoming chairman of the Archbishops' Western Canada Fund. He was the author of the prayer &#145;That in tranquillity Thy kingdom may go forward&#146;, which found a place in the 1928 prayer book.<br>
<br>During the first half of Paget's episcopate a group in north Oxford, under the formidable leadership of a South African War veteran, Colonel Le Mesurier, pressed him to allow the establishment of an evangelical church there. Paget was uncertain, again anxious to avoid open dissension, and laid himself open to charges of evasion and indecision, but eventually he came out in favour, and in 1906 attended the laying of the foundation stone of St Andrew's, Linton Road.<br>
<br>As a theological scholar Paget is remembered chiefly for his <span class="italic">Introduction to the Fifth Book of Hooker's Treatise of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</span> (1899; 2nd edn 1907), for his <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span> essay already mentioned, and for a masterly essay on <i>acedia</i>, or accidie, written at Christ Church in 1890 (reprinted separately in 1912), and published with a collection of sermons entitled <span class="italic">The Spirit of Discipline</span> in 1891 (7th edn 1896); the undergraduates called accidie &#145;the Dean's new sin&#146;. He also published <span class="italic">Faculties and Difficulties for Belief and Disbelief</span> (1887; 3rd edn 1894) and two other collections of sermons entitled respectively <span class="italic">Studies in Christian Character</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">The Redemption of War</span> (1900). Some sermons were published separately, including <span class="italic">The Virtue of Simplicity</span>, a gift surely erroneously applied to C. L. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) and H. G. Liddell, whom it fell to Paget to commemorate together in March 1898.<br>
<br>To his intimate friends, and in particular to Archbishop Davidson, Paget was not only a wise counsellor but a delightful companion. He had a cultivated sense of beauty in nature, in music, and in words; he had been head of the new choir at Shrewsbury, and Dante and Ruskin were among his interests. His tall, willowy figure and impressive, courtly bearing made him a notable figure in any assembly. Paget was attacked by a serious illness (volvulus) in the summer of 1910, and seemed to recover, but he died of a sudden recurrence of the malady, in a London nursing home at Welbeck House, Welbeck Street, on 2 August 1911. He was interred three days later in his wife's grave in the little burying-ground to the south of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.<br>
<br>The Pagets' four sons all at some time held commissions in the army; they included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31524/', "Archbishop Edward Francis Paget (1886&#150;1971)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35354/', "General Sir Bernard Paget (1887&#150;1961)")</script>. The Pagets' two daughters both married clergymen; the younger predeceased her father. Her husband jointly with her uncle, Stephen Paget, wrote a biography of the bishop (1912) which contains much detail on the Pagets' domestic life.<br>
