<span class="headword">Durham, Sir  Kenneth</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 28 July 1924 at 104 Stanley Street, Blackburn, Lancashire, the son of George Durham, house painter, and his wife, Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aspin. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Blackburn, and briefly read physics at Manchester University before serving in the Royal Air Force between 1942 and 1946, during which he qualified as a pilot and attained the rank of flight lieutenant. On 29 June 1946, while still an RAF officer, he married Irene Markham, a 22-year-old shop assistant from Blackburn, daughter of James Markham, overlooker. They went on to have a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After leaving the RAF, Durham returned to Manchester, where he won a Hatfield scholarship and graduated with first-class honours in physics. He then briefly joined the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell as a theoretical physicist before joining Unilever's Port Sunlight research laboratory in 1950. Port Sunlight was then the largest research laboratory owned by Unilever. This company had been formed in 1929 through a merger between the British-owned Lever Brothers and the Dutch-owned Margarine Union. It remained a highly unusual case of a business owned ultimately by two parent companies located in different countries, Britain and the Netherlands. Its chief executive was the three-person special committee consisting of the British and Dutch chairmen and a third executive. It was probably the largest European company at the time of its creation, and during the post-war decades it remained the leading European manufacturer of margarine and of soap and detergents. The giant global business also sold processed foods, ice cream and frozen products, tea, toothpaste and other toiletries, animal feeds, and chemicals; it owned vast plantations in Africa and elsewhere, and operated extensive shipping and other transport facilities. Unilever's research laboratories supported this vast enterprise, and were widely regarded as a major source of scientific innovation.<br>
<br>Durham's career flourished at Port Sunlight. He was recognized as not only a first-class scientist but also someone who understood that his company needed to commercialize its basic research by utilizing it to create products consumers wanted to buy. This was a major weakness of Unilever, a sprawling colossus noted for its inability to take decisions quickly and without innumerable internal discussions. In the late 1940s Unilever had faced the decimation of its large American laundry business after its American rival Procter and Gamble launched synthetic detergents. In 1961 Durham was appointed head of the Port Sunlight laboratory, and in the following year he was sent to attend the advanced management programme at the Harvard business school, the best executive educative programme in the world at the time, to which Unilever sent its potential future leaders. In 1965 he was appointed to head Unilever's fast-growing laboratory at Colworth in Bedfordshire. In 1970 Unilever transferred him to line management. He joined the large animal feeds business, which was performing poorly. In the following year he became chairman of BOCM Silcock, Unilever's British affiliate that made oilseed cake and other compound feeds for animals. Durham rapidly reduced the workforce from 10,000 to 3500, rationalized the product line, and moved production from the large oil mills located at ports which were dominated by confrontational trade unions to smaller mills scattered around the country. Durham's decisive, even aggressive, personality brought success within Unilever. He was appointed to the boards of the British and Dutch parent companies in 1973.<br>
<br>In 1978 Durham became the &#145;third man&#146; on the special committee. His years on Unilever's special committee coincided with a time of crisis for the firm. Its financial performance in Europe had deteriorated sharply earlier in the decade following the oil price rises of 1973, while poor local management had led to a catastrophic decline in market share and profitability in its American business. The company was so diversified that managerial attention was spread too thinly. The special committee functioned primarily as a reactive rather than proactive force. Durham became one of the major forces behind change. Crucially he helped force through shifts in Unilever's American business. In 1978 Unilever acquired the well-run National Starch Company in the United States, which became a catalyst for change. Durham was instrumental in the sacking of the chief executive of its largest American affiliate, long protected by ties of loyalty and friendship.<br>
<br>As the American business slowly turned round, Durham became chairman of the British company in 1982. Over the following four years he formulated, with his other colleagues on the special committee, Floris Maljers and Michael Angus, a radical programme of divestment of so-called non-core businesses, enabling the company to focus managerial time and financial resources on a narrower range of categories led by detergents, foods, personal care, and chemicals. The new strategy resulted in improved financial performance by a company that had looked like a potential target for takeover at the end of the 1970s.<br>
<br>Durham was knighted in 1985, and appointed commander of the order of Orange Nassau the same year. Following his retirement as chairman of Unilever in 1986 he went on to hold several other senior positions in British business. He served as chairman of Woolworth Holdings between 1986 and 1990, and as deputy chairman of British Aerospace between the same years (having been a director since 1980), and was also a director of the electrical components maker Delta (1984&#150;2004) and the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell (1986&#150;90). He served on various industry and government bodies, for example as chairman of the economic development committee for the food, drink, and packaging machinery industries (1981&#150;6), the economic policy committee of the Confederation of British Industry (1983&#150;6), and the Ministry of Agriculture's priorities board (1984&#150;7). He was also a trustee and later chairman of the Leverhulme Trust from 1974 to 1998. He devoted considerable time to charitable causes, and led a &pound;6 million fund-raising campaign for the charity Help the Aged. As president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1986&#150;7) he was a strong supporter of scientific research, and criticized governments for insufficient funding. He was made an honorary fellow of the British Academy in 1997, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Manchester and Loughborough, and Queen's University, Belfast. He lived latterly at Dove Cottage, Middle Entrance Drive, Storrs Park, Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria. He died on 17 February 2005 at Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal of myocardial infarction and acute renal failure.<br>
