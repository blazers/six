<span class="headword">Short <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Anderson]</span>,  Irene <span class="st"> [Renee]</span></span>  (1916&#150;2003), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 26 April 1916. Her father, whose surname was Anderson, died shortly after her birth and her mother, Miriam Marks, married Percy Gill. The young Renee had little contact with her mother except for Friday night celebrations of their Russian-Jewish ancestry. Brought up in Nottingham by her paternal grandparents, she attended Nottingham county secondary school for girls and entered Manchester University to study modern languages. There is no record of her taking a degree. At university she met Endre Schwarz (1915&#150;1999), a Hungarian-speaking Romanian national studying engineering. They married in 1940 and had two daughters, Ginette and Jennifer. As Andrew Short her husband became a structural engineer employed at the Building Research Centre.<br>
<br>After her marriage Renee Short became a shorthand journalist and later a theatrical costumier. Backed strongly by her husband, she began to develop a career in Hertfordshire local politics. A Labour member of the county council from 1952, she fought unsuccessful parliamentary election campaigns at St Albans in 1955 and at marginal Watford in 1959. Her political career began in a period of intense Labour factionalism. She was a regular contributor at party conferences, where her red hair and criticisms of party policy allowed stereotyping of her as a suburban left-winger.<br>
<br>In the October 1964 general election Short was successful in heavily working-class Wolverhampton North-East. She joined the left-wing Tribune group. Her eulogies on economic planning and public ownership typified its politics. Less common was her favourable attitude towards the Soviet Union, which she maintained even in the context of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968: &#145;I love and admire very much the Soviet Union &hellip; we find that the Soviet Union has done precisely that for which they attack the Americans in Vietnam &hellip; This is a very bitter thing for us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 769.1308&#150;9). She remained positive about many features of Soviet and east European societies.<br>
<br>Short's commitment to socialism was complemented by passionate and well-informed interventions on specific issues, often health and education, but most notably abortion law reform. She was one of the most dedicated advocates of abortion reform in the 1964 and 1966 parliaments. Subsequently she was a zealous opponent of any attempt to dilute the 1967 <span class="roman">Abortion Act</span>. Wolverhampton politics affected her position on immigration and race relations. Enoch Powell was her neighbouring member. His advocacy of further restriction and repatriation and his emotive language attracted support in Short's largely white constituency. She combined hostility to Powell with self-conscious &#145;realism&#146;. In February 1968 she spoke in favour of controversial legislation that deprived Kenyan Asians of their British citizenship. She commended Labour policies as effectively restricting immigration. This pragmatism did not protect her at the 1970 general election. She was opposed by a self-proclaimed Powellite, and her majority fell from over 8000 in 1966 to under 2000.<br>
<br>Short was a forceful and consistent opponent of British membership of the European Community, not least on the ground that membership would be an impediment to socialist advance in Britain. This emphasis on a British-based socialist strategy also illuminates her lack of sympathy for Scottish and Welsh devolution. In January 1978 she was among thirty-seven Labour MPs who supported the successful Cunningham amendment to the Scottish devolution bill, which required 40 per cent of the Scottish electorate (and not just a majority of those who voted) to back devolution in a referendum. This decisively blocked the achievement of a Scottish parliament the following year.<br>
<br>Short's reputation as a left-wing critic was strengthened by her role on the Labour Party's national executive. During the 1960s she had stood regularly but unsuccessfully as a candidate for the women's section. Election to this section required the backing of male-dominated trade unions. In 1970, with some major unions shifting to the left, Short was elected and became a reliable member of the executive's increasingly influential left-wing faction. She participated in acrimonious debates about policy and constitutional reform, including the mandatory reselection of MPs.<br>
<br>Short's knowledge of complex subjects was evident in the polarized politics of the 1980s. Her commitment to penal reform was expressed in a book published in 1979. For eight years she chaired the Commons select committee on social services effectively. These achievements were offset by difficulties within a factionalized Labour Party. Predictably she backed Tony Benn in the 1981 election for deputy leader, but his narrow defeat was accompanied by her own removal from the national executive. Sections of the trade union right had rallied and began to depose executive members with unacceptable views. She subsequently shifted towards Labour's political centre and supported Neil Kinnock in the 1983 leadership contest. Perhaps her very narrow victory in Wolverhampton in that year's general election had underlined the depth of Labour's crisis. Her political shift meant her re-election to the national executive at the 1983 conference. Her fortunes in executive elections owed more to the complexities of trade union politics than to her advocacy of Labour women's priorities. By the 1980s she was distant from many of the concerns of Labour feminists, not least their demand that women should elect the members of the women's section. She proved vulnerable to the reselection procedure that she had supported. Her backing within the Wolverhampton Labour Party declined in part because of factional rivalries. Her continuing residence in Hertfordshire might also have been a vulnerability. Having narrowly won a reselection contest in 1981 she anticipated a more formidable attempt to replace her in 1985. This time she decided to retire at the next election. She left the Commons in May 1987. At the subsequent general election her former seat was won by the Conservatives for the only time in the twentieth century. She died on 18 January 2003 at the Horton Hospital in Banbury, and was survived by her two daughters, her husband having predeceased her.<br>
<br>Renee Short was very much a Labour left-winger of her generation. Enthusiasm for economic planning and advocacy of a better relationship with the Soviet bloc combined with campaigns on specific issues where her expertise could generate wider support. Her traditional left-wing politics could incorporate robust advocacy of abortion reform. She seemed less comfortable with later feminist campaigns. Her position within the party owed much to a left-wing trade union factionalism that complemented the strengths and limitations of her own politics.<br>
