<span class="headword">Kalecki,  Micha&#322;</span>  (1899&#150;1970), <span class="occ">economist and policy adviser</span>, was born on 22 June 1899 into a Polish-Jewish family in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, now in Poland, then occupied by Russia. He was the only child of Abram Kalecki (<i>d</i>. 1933), the owner of a small cotton mill, and his wife, Klara Segalla, who died in unknown circumstances during the Second World War. His father, described by Kalecki as a &#145;victim of technical progress&#146;, lost the mill in 1913 and became a bookkeeper in his brother's company. Kalecki enrolled in the I Philological Lyc&eacute;e in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, where he completed four grades before the outbreak of war. The German occupation authorities closed the school in 1914&#150;15, but Kalecki then enrolled at the Father Ignacy Skorupka II Philological Lyc&eacute;e in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;. After receiving his secondary school certificate in 1917 he began studying at the Warsaw University Engineering College. His studies were interrupted after two terms when he was drafted into the army, and he served for seven months in the VI telegraph battalion in Lw&oacute;w: he was later discharged from the army in 1921 on health grounds.<br>
<br>Kalecki was able to begin mathematical studies at the department of philosophy of Warsaw University in February 1920, and transferred to the engineering college of Danzig University a year later. He received the first degree certificate in 1923, but discontinued his studies in 1925 shortly before graduation to support his family because his father had lost his job. He returned to &#321;&oacute;d&#378; where he undertook some tutoring and worked for a number of firms including one in the field of credit intelligence. He began his own study of economics about this time, studying first such writers as Rosa Luxemburg, Turan-Baranovski, and Marx. Only at a relatively late stage was he exposed to the ideas of neo-classical economics then dominant in Polish academic circles. His attitudes were also strongly influenced by the prevailing levels of unemployment in Poland. In 1927 he moved to Warsaw and earned his living in a range of jobs, including making engineering calculations of reinforced concrete constructions. He also started writing for the journals <span class="italic">Preeglad Gospodarczy</span> and <span class="italic">Przemys&#322; I Handel</span>, mainly on the operations of large businesses and on business conditions in particular markets. In December 1929 he became a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Business Cycles and Prices (ISBCP), headed by Edward Lipi&#324;ski. Initially he studied the structure and operation of cartels, and later business fluctuations and national income in Poland. He was also involved in political journalism and maintained close connections with left-wing socialist movements. He married Adela (Ada) Szternfeld (1903&#150;1994) on 18 June 1930.<br>
<br>In 1933 Kalecki published a paper in Polish under the title &#145;Outline of a theory of the business cycle&#146; (reprinted as chapter 1 of M. Kalecki, <span class="italic">Selected Essays on the Dynamics of the Capitalist Economy, 1933&#150;1970</span>, 1971) in which he presented the basic idea of the importance of fluctuations in investment expenditure as a generator of business cycles. This and some related papers form the basis of the claim that Kalecki published some of the key ideas of Keynes before Keynes himself (1933 versus 1936).<br>
<br>In 1935 Kalecki received a twelve-month Rockefeller scholarship to enable him to study abroad. He visited Sweden for the first three months of 1936, and then travelled to England in April 1936. There he made contact with leading British economists such as Keynes, Joan Robinson, and others who were developing ideas similar to his own. He resigned from the ISBCP in November 1936, protesting against limits on the freedom of research. He received an extension of his Rockefeller scholarship, and then a scholarship from Cambridge University to enable him to complete his first book, <span class="italic">Essays in the Theory of Economic Fluctuations</span> (1939), based on papers written in the late 1930s. In this book, as well as providing a theory of the business cycle, Kalecki also advanced a theory of the distribution of income (between wages and profits) based on the market power of firms. The idea of the &#145;principle of increasing risk&#146; was developed, whereby the investment undertaken by a single firm is limited by the increasing risk which would be entailed by more investment reflected in a rising cost of finance.<br>
<br>Kalecki was appointed a statistical assistant for the economics department of Cambridge University and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research from October 1938 to February 1940. This was followed by a move to Oxford where he was employed at the Oxford University Institute of Statistics. There he worked on the British war economy, particularly rationing, war finance, and then post-war reconstruction, and made frequent contributions to the three weekly reports on economic matters published by the institute. He contributed to the major and influential study <span class="italic">The Economics of Full Employment: Six Studies in Applied Economics</span> (1944). He argued that full employment could be achieved through deficit spending by government, through redistribution of income from higher- to lower-income groups, but that the stimulation of private investment was not a satisfactory way to achieve full employment. During this period he developed the arguments that the political and social problems involved in the achievement of full employment were much greater than the economic problems involved.<br>
<br>In 1945, after some time working for the French ministry of national economy, Kalecki moved to the International Labour Office in Montreal, Canada, where he worked mainly on post-war reconstruction and full employment. In July 1946 he returned to Poland for three months as an adviser to the ministry of reconstruction, the ministry of finance, and the central planning office. At the end of 1946 he was appointed deputy director of a section of the economics department of the United Nations secretariat. During his time at the UN he supervised a range of studies on food shortage and inflationary pressures, and made major contributions to the annual <span class="italic">World Economic Report</span>. He spent two months in 1950 as economic adviser to the Israeli government. He resigned from the UN at the end of 1954 in response to the restrictions placed on himself and others by the intervention of the USA under the influence of McCarthyism.<br>
<br>From the beginning of 1955 Kalecki's home was in Poland. The first two years of his return to Poland coincided with the growth of overt political opposition to the Polish government; the Poznan workers' uprising in June 1956 and the spread of strikes across Poland; and the spontaneous creation of workers' councils in October 1956 (the &#145;Polish October&#146;). In April 1955 Kalecki was appointed chief adviser to Hilary Minc, the deputy prime minister. From December of that year he was also employed by the Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences where he headed research on the capitalist economies. In October 1956 he was appointed deputy chairman of a joint Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) and the government &#145;commission to assist the proper development of workers' initiative in workplace management&#146; established in response to the spontaneous formation of workers' councils. In June 1956 he received his first academic title as professor of economics, conferred by the central qualifications commission, and in July he was appointed professor of economics in the Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In January 1957 he was appointed one of the deputy chairmen of the economic council at the Council of Ministers. In September 1957 Kalecki was appointed chairman of the commission of perspective planning, but his official role effectively ended in 1960. During a visit to India as an economic adviser on financing the third five-year plan there, the perspective plan for which he had supervised the preparation was heavily criticized and rejected. In May 1960 he was dismissed from the board of the planning commission, but appointed scientific adviser to the chairman of the planning commission with a much narrower range of powers. In 1959 he was awarded the officer's cross of the order of the Rebirth of Poland.<br>
<br>In the last decade of his life Kalecki was heavily involved with problems of economic development, including seminars organized at the academy of sciences, Warsaw University, and the central school for planning and statistics. By 1968 the political climate in Poland had changed considerably for the worse, and Kalecki's outspokenness and disagreement with the country's heavy industry investment programme (and an element of antisemitism) brought him into disfavour.<br>
<br>Kalecki made substantial contributions to the analysis of developed capitalist, socialist, and developing economies. His writings on the economics of socialism were undertaken only after his return to Poland in December 1954. He was directly involved in many of the debates of the mid-1950s on the development and organization of the Polish economy. His general approach could be summarized as seeking a departure from the system of bureaucratic centralism, the main lines of development in the economy being centrally planned, with the market mechanism used in a subordinate role. He further advocated a substantial increase in self-management by workers (under a system of workers' councils), while acknowledging that there would be tension between central planning and workers' councils. He was heavily involved with teaching and research in the area of development planning from the late 1950s to the late 1960s, organizing courses and seminars on underdeveloped economies.<br>
<br>Many of Kalecki's major writings on capitalism, socialism, and developing economies were republished after his death in <span class="italic">Selected Essays on the Dynamics of the Capitalist Economy, 1933&#150;1970</span> (1971), <span class="italic">Selected Essays on the Economic Growth of the Socialist and the Mixed Economy</span> (1972), and <span class="italic">Essays on Developing Economies</span> (1976). He died on 17 April 1970 of a cerebral haemorrhage and was buried in the Alley of the Meritorious in the Pow&#261;zkowski cemetery in Warsaw.<br>
