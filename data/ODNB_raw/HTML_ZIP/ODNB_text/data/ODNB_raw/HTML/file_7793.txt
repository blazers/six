<span class="headword">Don, Sir  William Henry</span>, seventh baronet  (1825&#150;1862), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 4 May 1825, the only son of Sir Alexander Don of Newtondon, Berwickshire, sixth baronet (<i>d</i>. 1826), MP for Roxburghshire, and his wife, Grace [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28532/', "Wallace, Grace Jane, Lady Wallace")</script>], the eldest daughter of John Stein of Edinburgh. His father was a close friend of Sir Walter Scott, and a frequent attendant at his dinner parties. William Henry Don succeeded to the baronetcy when less than a year old. His mother married as her second husband Sir James Maxwell Wallace, of Ainderby Hall, near Northallerton. Don was educated at Eton College between 1838 and 1841. In August 1839 he took part in the Eglinton tournament as page to Lady Montgomerie. He entered the army as a cornet in the 5th dragoon guards in June 1842, was an extra aide-de-camp to the lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1844, and became lieutenant in the 5th dragoon guards in 1845; in November that year he retired from the army, deep in debt. The fine estate called Newtondon, left him by his father, had to be sold, and produced &pound;85,000, which went to his creditors. He was then compelled to turn to account the experience which he had acquired as an amateur actor.<br>
<br>After a short starring engagement in the north of England, and following his marriage to Antonia, the daughter of M. Lebrun of Hamburg, on 1 June 1847, he went to America. He made his first public appearance there as John Duck in <span class="italic">The Jacobite</span> at the Broadway Theatre, New York, on 27 October 1850. Shortly afterwards he was seen in the character of Sir Charles Coldstream in Boucicault's comedy <span class="italic">Used Up</span>. He remained in America for nearly five years, playing with success in New York, Philadelphia, and other large towns, and on his return to England found that after all his affairs had been wound up he was still in debt about &pound;7000. In an attempt to pay off this sum he continued as a comic actor. He began in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and after a provincial tour went to the Haymarket Theatre, London, where in 1857 he acted in J. M. Morton's farce <span class="italic">Whitebait at Greenwich</span>. His first marriage ended for unknown reasons, and on 17 October 1857, at Marylebone, he married Emily Eliza Saunders, the eldest daughter of John Saunders of the Adelphi Theatre, London. She had been well known as a lively actress in comedy and farce at the Adelphi, Haymarket, Surrey, and other theatres for some years.<br>
<br>In 1861 Don and his wife went to Australia, where he appeared at the Royal Theatre, Melbourne. At this period he had taken to playing female characters in burlesques. In February 1862 he visited Hobart Town, Tasmania, with a company of his own, where he fell ill with an inflammation of the lungs. On 15 March 1862 he played Queen Elizabeth in the burlesque <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span>, by Robert Reece and H. B. Farnie, and four days later, on 19 March 1862, he died from aneurysm of the aorta at Webb's Hotel, Hobart Town. He had a private burial in the same town. He left two daughters, Alexina Mary from his first marriage, and Harriette Grace Mary from his second; in the absence of any male heir, the title ended with him. Don possessed a fine sense of humour, a quick perception of the ludicrous side of life and character, a remarkable talent for mimicry, a strong nerve, a ready wit, and great self-possession.<br>
<br>Lady Don returned to England after her husband's death and resumed her professional career, but with no very profitable result, though she had been very popular in the Australian colonies and in New Zealand. In 1867 she went to the United States, where she made her appearance on 18 February at the New York Theatre in <span class="italic">Peggy Green</span> and the burlesque <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span>; on the close of the season she returned to England. She was for a short period lessee of the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, and assisted at the opening of the Gaiety Theatre, Edinburgh. Latterly she was in reduced circumstances and was obliged to appear as a vocalist in music halls. She died at Edinburgh on 20 September 1875. Don's first wife, Antonia, died in 1869.<br>
