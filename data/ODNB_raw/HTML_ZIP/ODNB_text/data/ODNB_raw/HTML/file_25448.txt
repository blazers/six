<span class="headword">Shirwood,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1519&#150;1523), <span class="occ">Hebraist</span>, was born in Coventry and educated at Oxford University, where &#145;he made considerable progress in logicals, but more by far in the Hebrew and Greek languages&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.58). But who could have taught him Hebrew in early sixteenth-century Oxford remains a mystery. To further his knowledge of oriental languages, Shirwood travelled abroad and eventually settled in Louvain, attracted by the presence of the eminent English Hebraist Robert Wakefield at the Collegium Trilingue. By December 1519 he was considered a linguist of sufficient calibre to replace Wakefield as professor of Hebrew. But he resigned after only one month and eventually returned to England. He spent the rest of his life as rector of Dyrham, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Shirwood's significance in the history of scholarship rests not only on the fact that he was one of the first Hebrew scholars in Tudor England, but also on his use of rabbinic commentators to elucidate the text of scripture. Though he is credited with making a Latin translation of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>, his only extant work (apart from a few sermons) is a Latin version of <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>, published together with a commentary at Antwerp in 1523. In the preface Shirwood emphasizes that his translation is not a paraphrase but a verbatim rendering of the Hebrew, which students should find helpful because of its literalness and accuracy compared to the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>. Difficult words and phrases are explained by using the <span class="roman">Targum</span> and the comments of medieval rabbis. His intention is not to censure the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>, but to rectify errors and omissions and make the meaning of the text that much plainer. He is also anxious to rescue <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> from the obscurity into which it had apparently fallen, and to encourage others to study it. A mark of the esteem in which Shirwood's version was held is that the Jesuit scholar Juan de Pineda included it alongside those of Jerome, the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, and the <span class="roman">Targum</span> in his 1620 polyglot edition of <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> on the grounds that it was true to the Hebrew original.<br>
<br>The notes provided for the guidance of the reader reveal a competent Hebraist familiar with the rabbis. Almost a decade before Pagninus and Sebastian Muenster demonstrated the value of rabbinic commentaries for a better understanding of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Shirwood had recognized the relevance of the Jewish exegetical tradition for Christians. He was one of the earliest English scholars to appreciate post-biblical Jewish writings.<br>
