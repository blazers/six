<span class="headword">Stackhouse,  Thomas</span>  (1681/2&#150;1752), <span class="occ">religious writer and controversialist</span>, the son of John Stackhouse (1652?&#150;1734), vicar of Coniscliffe (1712&#150;18) and later rector of Boldon, co. Durham, was born at Witton-le-Wear, in that county, where his father was then curate. He was educated for three years at Sedbergh School under Mr Wharton. On 3 April 1699 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, aged seventeen, but the designation of MA that appears on the title-pages of some of his works does not seem to represent a degree from an English university; according to family tradition his MA may have been obtained during his residence abroad. From 1701 to 1704 he was headmaster of Hexham grammar school, and on 24 December 1704 he was ordained priest in London. He then became curate of Shepperton, Middlesex, and from 1713 was minister of the English church in Amsterdam. On his return to England he held a succession of curacies at Ealing, Richmond, and, by 1731, Finchley. He was twice married: he had two sons with his first wife, who died in 1709, and two sons and a daughter with his second wife, Elizabeth Reynell.<br>
<br>For some time Stackhouse lived in poverty, and in 1722, under the designation of &#145;A Clergyman of the Church of England&#146;, he printed a letter addressed to Bishop John Robinson (1650&#150;1723) in which he exposed the &#145;miseries and great hardships of the inferior clergy, in and about London&#146;. It was reprinted several times and by 1737 carried Stackhouse's name on the title-page. In addition to publishing some of the sermons that he had preached at Richmond, Stackhouse attempted to supplement his meagre earnings in the 1720s through paid work for booksellers. He edited <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life, and Conduct, of Dr. Francis Atterbury, Late Bishop of Rochester</span> (1723), which he dedicated to William Pulteney and which portrayed Atterbury as deluded by ambition. In this work Stackhouse also allowed himself an attack on those who postponed his own advancement, in particular criticizing the &#145;daily and visible Insufficiency&#146; of Bishop Robinson  (p. 71). He published an abridgement of Gilbert Burnet's <span class="italic">History of his Own Times</span> (1724) and edited other works occasionally thereafter, for example assisting in the revision of Sir William Dawes's <span class="italic">The Duties of the Closet</span> (1732). He also translated <span class="italic">Chinese Tales</span>, by Thomas Simon Gueulette, which he dedicated to Mrs Pulteney, and produced <span class="italic">Reflections on the Nature and Property of Languages</span> (1731), based on the work of du Tremblay, in which he argued for the evolution of language over time. A more ambitious work of compilation, demonstrating Stackhouse's commitment to improving the learning as well as the income of the lesser clergy, was <span class="italic">A Complete Body of Divinity</span> (1729), which summarized under various doctrinal headings a wide range of contemporary theological and apologetic works, including many of the Boyle lectures.<br>
<br>By the 1730s Stackhouse was looking to benefit from the opportunities created by booksellers who wanted to publish serialized works of reference. His edition of Burnet was issued in the <span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span> between 1734 and 1737. But his most important venture was a successor to <span class="italic">A Complete Body of Divinity</span>, to be called <span class="italic">A Complete History of the Holy Bible</span>. Stackhouse had in May 1732 been approached by John Wilford and Thomas Edlin, to whom he owed money for books, to write a work for publication in parts, and had suggested this subject. He subsequently contracted with Edlin but soon fell out with him over payment and the rate of production of both copy and printed text. This quarrel led Edlin to engage John Campbell to take over the work, which he hurried out in 1733, though not before Stackhouse had published <span class="italic">The Book-Binder, Book-Printer, and Book-Seller Confuted</span> (1732), defending himself and revealing Edlin's shortcomings as a publisher. Having shrewdly learned his lesson, Stackhouse completed his own text, now called <span class="italic">A New History of the Holy Bible</span>, and published it himself in 1733. Illustrated with maps and plates, each dedicated to a different member of the hierarchy of the Church of England, this book was based on wide reading and written in an accessible style. It proved to be a great success as a reliable work of reference. A new edition, with a royal privilege and a dedication to Bishop Gibson, appeared between 1742 and 1744 in weekly parts priced 6<i>d</i>., and in 1752 a further subscription was raised for an edition with 104 new plates, engraved at a cost of &pound;800. Despite continuing disputes over copyright there were frequent reprintings at both London and Edinburgh throughout the rest of the century, and editions continued to appear from provincial presses in the nineteenth century, including one published at Newcastle in 1809 with engravings by Thomas Bewick.<br>
<br>Stackhouse enjoyed further success through serial publication when he issued his <span class="italic">New and Practical Exposition of the Apostles Creed</span>, in twenty-eight parts at 6<i>d</i>. each, from October 1746. A final compilation of a similar kind, <span class="italic">The Life of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: with the Lives of the Apostles and Evangelists</span>, was published posthumously in 1754 despite an injunction in Stackhouse's will that all his manuscripts were to be burnt. It would be too easy to dismiss Stackhouse's literary productions as hack work. His historical works were frequently reprinted, and his biblical and doctrinal compilations reached a wide audience at home and abroad. Several editions of <span class="italic">A Complete Body of Divinity</span>, translated into French by J.-F. Boisot, were published at Lausanne from 1759. All four of Stackhouse's major theological works were translated by the Halle-educated pastor Friedrich Eberhard Rambach, and editions were published in German at Rostock, Breslau, and even Philadelphia, where they found favour with pietist divines and readers.<br>
<br>The admiration that Stackhouse felt for Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, is apparent in the dedications to <span class="italic">A Fair State of the Controversy between Mr Woolston and his Adversaries</span> (1730) and <span class="italic">A Defence of the Christian Religion from the Several Objections of Modern Antiscripturists</span> (1731), both of which drew heavily on the attacks on deism in the pastoral letter to his diocese that Gibson had recently printed. Charles Chais translated <span class="italic">A Defence</span> into French in 1738, and it proved popular on the continent as well as in England, although it was criticized by Liberato Fassoni in his <span class="italic">De leporii libello</span>, published at Rome in 1761.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26198"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Stackhouse</span>  (1706&#150;1784), <span class="occ">educational writer</span>, was the younger son of Thomas Stackhouse and his first wife. He married on 4 April 1767 Hester Nash (<i>d</i>. 1794) at St James's, Piccadilly, and appears to have made his living from teaching aristocratic pupils, who included Lady Georgiana Spencer, the future duchess of Devonshire, and the grandchildren of the dowager duchess of Beaufort. He was also responsible for the education of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26199/', "Thomas Stackhouse (1756&#150;1836)")</script>, antiquary. He published a new Greek grammar in 1762, <span class="italic">A General View of Ancient History, Chronology, and Geography</span> in 1770, and <span class="italic">The English Particles Rendered into Classical Latin</span> in 1772. He died at Lisson Grove, London, in 1784.<br>
<br>With Gibson's patronage the elder Thomas Stackhouse was appointed to the vicarage of Beenham Valence in Berkshire in the summer of 1733. He died there on 15 October 1752 and was buried in the parish church, where a monument consisting of a representation in stone of <span class="italic">A New History of the Holy Bible</span> was erected to his memory. The ironic Latin verses <span class="italic">Vana doctrinae emolumenta, et varia studiorum incommoda</span>, which were published under his name in 1752, suggest that the concerns that had first tempted him into print continued to bother him at the end of his life.<br>
