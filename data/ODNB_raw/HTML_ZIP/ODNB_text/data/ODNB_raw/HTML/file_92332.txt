<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hawtrey,  Charles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>George Frederick Joffre Hartree]</span>  (1914&#150;1988), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at 217 Cromwell Road, Hounslow, Middlesex, on 30 November 1914, the second son of William John Hartree (1885&#150;1952), motor car mechanic, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crow (1880&#150;1965). He showed an interest in entertainment from an early age, organizing plays with local children in the family garden. As a child he appeared in two silent films, <span class="italic">Tell Your Children</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">This Freedom</span> (1923), now both lost. By all accounts he was already an accomplished self-taught pianist and dancer, and was able to display these talents in local amateur dramatics. His first venture onto the professional stage was a small part in <span class="italic">The Windmill Man</span> at the Hippodrome, Boscombe, in 1925.<br>
<br>Aged fourteen Hartree enrolled in the Italia Conti Academy of Dramatic Arts, and it was Conti's idea to change his name to Charles Hawtrey. The inspiration was the actor and theatre manager Sir Charles Hawtrey (1858&#150;1923). Hartree happily perpetuated the myth that Sir Charles was indeed his true father. His fees for his three-year course were met by working on the stage. He also achieved some fame as a boy soprano, making a number of records for the Regal Label with the eleven-year-old Evelyn Griffiths.<br>
<br>On leaving Conti's, Hawtrey resumed his film career, taking small parts in around twenty films before the outbreak of the Second World War. Those which survive from this period indicate how little he changed over his long career. His waif-like frame is instantly recognizable: his trademark glasses almost always in place, and his curious use of eyeline&#151;his eyes darting birdlike from place to place in an unexpected manner&#151;already characterize his performance. Many of these appearances are fleeting, but this does not make them unmemorable, especially his turn for Alfred Hitchcock in <span class="italic">Sabotage</span> (1936), where he is seen and heard declaiming on the sex lives of oysters to his girlfriend at London Zoo. More important, however, were the films he made that were star vehicles for some of the great comics of the period: Max Miller, Stanley Lupino, Will Fyffe, Will Hay, and, during the war, George Formby. Of these it was the four films he appeared in with Will Hay&#151;playing scholarly schoolboys&#151;that would prove to be the most significant, starting with <span class="italic">Good Morning, Boys</span> in 1937. Hay was something of a mentor for Hawtrey; he admired him greatly both as a performer and as a man, for his brilliant timing and for his intellectualism.<br>
<br>Hawtrey remained prolific in the theatre, receiving acclaim as a bogus Countess in <span class="italic">Counterfeit</span> (1939) at the Duke of York's theatre, where it was only revealed at the end that his character was not a woman, the fidelity of this subterfuge confirmed to a wider audience in his 1940 film outing, <span class="italic">Jailbirds</span>. Hawtrey's status as a conscientious objector meant that his career was not interrupted by the war, and continued on stage, screen, and radio. The last medium includes his Norman in <span class="italic">Norman and Henry Bones, the Boy Detectives</span> from 1943; being part of the team for <span class="italic">The Will Hay Programme</span> (1944&#150;5); and recurring roles in <span class="italic">Just William</span> (1945&#150;6), <span class="italic">Ray's a Laugh</span> (1952&#150;7), and <span class="italic">Life with the Lyons</span> (1955&#150;7). The end of the war saw Hawtrey break new ground when he tried his hand at direction. In 1945 he completed two films, <span class="italic">What Do We Do Now?</span> with George Moon and Burton Brown, and <span class="italic">Dumb Dora Discovers Tobacco</span> with Henry Kendall&#151;both now lost; and between 1945 and 1953 he directed a number of well-received stage productions, initially at the Q Theatre.<br>
<br>The stardom which Hawtrey craved as an actor, however, remained elusive. The occasional good part came his way&#151;the bar-working pianist in <span class="italic">Passport to Pimlico</span> (1949), and the turncoat temperance student in <span class="italic">You're Only Young Twice</span> (1952). But all too often he was buried down the cast list. Television broke the mould when the newly fledged Independent Television channel hired him for their comedy series <span class="italic">The Army Game</span> in 1957. He played one of the national service recruits, the Professor&#151;an aloof, knitting-obsessed weakling&#151;and appeared in the first two seasons. The series was an immense success, and it led directly to Hawtrey being offered a role in the first <span class="italic">Carry On</span> film, <span class="italic">Carry On Sergeant</span> (1958).<br>
<br>The popularity of <span class="italic">Carry On Sergeant</span> ensured that sequels would follow, and Hawtrey was a key member of the acting ensemble which underscored their success. He appeared in all but one of the first twenty-four entries, as well as two Christmas television spin-offs, usually with an entrance incorporating his catch phrase &#145;Oh, Hello&#146;. In the films, his character was generally a sexually ambiguous, optimistic, otherworldly loner, which nevertheless suited him to a wide variety of roles.<br>
<br>Sadly, Hawtrey seems to have had a lonely life enhanced by bitterness that his early achievements were largely overlooked. He lived with and cared for his mother until her death in 1965. His drinking, already heavy at this point, dramatically increased and began to interfere with his work. When he got into an argument with the <span class="italic">Carry On</span> producers about billing&#151;a damaging recurring issue for Hawtrey, contributing to his dismissal from both <span class="italic">Henry Bones</span> and <span class="italic">The Army Game</span>&#151;it gave them the excuse they wanted to drop him from the series. His last <span class="italic">Carry On</span> appearance was the 1972 <span class="italic">Carry On Abroad</span>, in which he plays an habitual drinker, providing cover for his real-life addiction.<br>
<br>During the <span class="italic">Carry On</span> years Hawtrey worked on two television series&#151;<span class="italic">Our House</span> (1960&#150;62), scripted by <span class="italic">Carry On</span> films Norman Hudis, and <span class="italic">Best of Friends</span> (1963) with Hylda Baker. Little other work came his way, and with the end of his participation in the <span class="italic">Carry On</span> films his career ground to a virtual halt. He isolated himself from his old colleagues, taking up residence in the seaside town of Deal, where he spent much of his time drunk and incapable.<br>
<br>Hawtrey had always happily accepted his own homosexuality, and was unquestionably brave in the early years in portraying effeminate camp characters and making little attempt to distinguish them from his own personality at a time when being gay could have landed him in gaol. While he was relatively discreet before legalization, in later years drink clouded his judgement, and he became increasingly reckless in his sexual encounters, culminating in a rent boy setting fire to his house in 1984 in retaliation for Hawtrey's prevarication over payment.<br>
<br>A lifeline was provided by the impresario Aubrey Phillips with touring shows, but Hawtrey became too unpredictable even for these. In the end his excesses caught up with him and he died at Winthorpe Lodge Rest Home, Kingsdown Road, Walmer, Kent, on 27 October 1988, after refusing a potentially life-saving operation which would have meant losing both his legs. He was cremated at Mortlake crematorium on 3 November.<br>
