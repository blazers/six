<span class="headword">Littleton,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1625, <em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">planter and judge in Barbados</span>, was baptized on 21 December 1625 in Stoke St Milborough, Shropshire, the son of Sir Adam Littleton (<i>d</i>. 1647), son of Thomas Littleton, and his wife Frances Lutley. His mother was Audrey (<i>d</i>. 1648), daughter of Thomas Poyntz of North Ockendon, Essex, and his wife, Jane Peryam. He attended Westminster School (according to Anthony Wood) before becoming a commoner in St Mary Hall, Oxford, matriculating on 2 April 1641. He graduated BA on 6 July 1644, was elected a fellow of All Souls in 1646, and proceeded MA on 14 December 1648. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 24 April 1649, but seems to have remained in Oxford for several years, as he was senior proctor in 1656. He was incorporated MA at Cambridge in 1657, but resigned his Oxford fellowship in 1663 and was called to the bar in 1664. Two years later he sailed to Barbados to serve both as secretary to William, sixth Baron Willoughby of Parham, the governor, and as king's attorney for the island colony. About 1669, while living on Barbados, Littleton married Dorothy, widow of Edward Harrison of Barbados and daughter of John Booth, of Glossop, Derbyshire. The Littletons had no children.<br>
<br>By 1673 Littleton had become one of the largest landowners on Barbados, with 600 acres. Although he soon sold much of the land, the census of 1679 reveals that he remained one of the leading planters on the island. He had 205 acres in St James parish with 120 slaves and three servants. Littleton served for several years as a judge of the Holetown court of common pleas, and for six years from 1674 he represented St James parish in the house of assembly, twice serving as speaker of that body. In these positions he became a staunch advocate for the interests of the planter class. When a new governor, Sir Richard Dutton, arrived in 1680, Littleton led the opposition to Dutton's efforts to force planters into compliance with imperial rule. Early in 1682 Dutton reported that he had dissolved the assembly and dismissed all his detractors from civil and military positions including Littleton. The latter was vindicated when a newly elected assembly selected him as speaker.<br>
<br>In 1683 Littleton returned to England, where he spent the rest of his life. He remained an opponent of Dutton, appearing as a witness against him before the lords of trade in autumn 1683. He also published an impassioned defence of his fellow planters in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The groans of the plantations, or, A true account of their grievous and extreme sufferings by the heavy impositions upon sugar, and other hardships relating more particularly to the island of Barbados</span> (1689). In it he charged that his fellow sugar planters had been brought to the brink of ruin by heavy customs duties, the requirement that they purchase all imports from within the empire, and their dependence upon the Royal African Company for slaves. The Barbados assembly not only sent a letter of thanks to Littleton; they hired him to serve as their agent. For a decade beginning in 1691 he lobbied successfully with William III and the House of Commons on behalf of his fellow sugar planters. His efforts contributed to the repeal of an imperial sugar tax imposed in 1685 and the withdrawal from the Royal African Company of its monopoly permitting new traders to enter the slave trade&#151;a circumstance that rapidly doubled the number of slaves delivered to the island. Although Littleton published several other pamphlets dealing largely with imperial, diplomatic, and economic issues, his significance derives from <span class="italic">The Groans of the Plantations</span> and his other activities on behalf of Barbados sugar planters. He is last recorded as agent for Barbados in 1701, and was buried at Greenwich, Kent, on 9 February 1702.<br>
