<span class="headword">Gray,  Francis James <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1880&#150;1935), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Oxford on 31 August 1880, the only son of Alderman Sir Walter Gray and his wife, Emily Alice Savage. <a name="cosubject_68779"></a><span class="headword">Sir Walter Gray</span>  (1848&#150;1918), <span class="occ">property speculator and local politician</span>, was born in Weston, Hertfordshire, and educated at Stevenage grammar school. He joined the Great Northern Railway Company and became stationmaster at Waddington, Lincolnshire, where John Shaw-Stewart, a member of Keble College's council, was a regular passenger. On Shaw-Stewart's recommendation, Gray was brought to Oxford in 1870 as steward to the newly established college. He stayed in the post for thirteen years, and began a series of property speculations in north Oxford and elsewhere that made his fortune. He was elected a Conservative councillor for the city's north ward in 1881 and, following the collapse of the Liberal-dominated Oxford Building and Investment Company in 1883, he achieved a political coup by becoming the company's official liquidator. He was elected alderman on the new county borough council in 1889 and was for many years the recognized leader of the Conservatives on the council. He was mayor of Oxford four times between 1888 and 1901 and was knighted in 1902. In 1917 Gray was passed over as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Oxford city constituency in favour of the historian J. A. R. Marriott. This snub is sometimes said to have converted his son to the Liberal cause, but Frank had already become an enemy of class privilege by that time. Walter Gray died at Rothbury, Northumberland, on 17 March 1918.<br>
<br>Frank Gray was educated at Rugby School and at F. B. Harvey's crammer in Woodstock before being articled as a solicitor's clerk to Dr Harry Galpin, the Oxford City solicitor, in 1898. His articles were transferred to the Hon. Robert Lyttelton in London in 1902, and after passing his final law exams he remained with Lyttelton until 1906. On returning to Oxford, he set up as a solicitor in partnership with Andrew Walsh and, with influential local contacts, soon built up a successful local practice. He achieved local celebrity in 1913&#150;14 when he and William Richard Morris roused public opinion in a battle to bring motor buses to Oxford. On 11 July 1914 he married Eveline Reine Panton, with whom he had one daughter; the couple separated in the early 1930s.<br>
<br>Gray's friendships with a chimney sweep, a bookmaker, and other dubious local characters demonstrated his unconventional nature and, despite exemption from conscription, he enlisted in the army on 13 February 1917. Refusing a commission, he served as a private until the armistice, seeing action at Passchendaele before securing a staff appointment. His wartime experiences encouraged him to stand for parliament, but he was defeated as the Liberal candidate for Watford in March 1918. He retired as a solicitor in 1919 and campaigned on behalf of farm workers before unsuccessfully trying to get a job as a miner in Warwickshire in order to expose working conditions in the pits.<br>
<br>In 1920 Gray was adopted as the Liberal candidate for Oxford City and in November 1922 his populist style won him a majority of 3806 in a seat which the Conservatives had held since 1885. An active MP at Westminster, Gray nursed his constituency by holding regular surgeries and by his involvement with many local institutions. He defended the seat in November 1923 when his support for free trade led to a bitter dispute with his former friend W. R. Morris. He was re-elected with a reduced majority of 2693 and was rewarded with the post of junior whip, but he was soon found to have exceeded his election expenses. A petition was filed in February 1924 and Gray's inexperienced agent was found guilty of corrupt practices; Gray himself escaped censure but his election was declared void. He stood for parliament again at Central Portsmouth in October 1924, but was heavily defeated. He blamed the disappointing result on the effects of the Zinoviev letter.<br>
<br>Freed from parliamentary commitments, Gray served on the Oxfordshire county council and Ploughley rural district council, but he found local government frustrating and concentrated his energies elsewhere. A long-term interest in tramps encouraged him to disguise himself as a vagrant and see for himself the conditions in local workhouses. After the repeal of the poor law in 1929, he established Frank Gray House in the former Bicester workhouse to help reclaim young vagrants; he also welcomed many tramps at his home in Shipton Manor, Shipton-on-Cherwell, and tried to find useful work for them. In 1926 he flirted with exploration, using two standard Jowett cars to drive across Africa from Lagos to the Red Sea. In 1928 he helped to establish the <span class="italic">Oxford Mail</span>, the city's first evening newspaper, and then threw himself into a scheme to develop a zoo, pleasure garden, and associated housing at Kidlington as a gateway to Oxford.<br>
<br>Frank Gray was a smallish man who typically wore a black tie and black coat with checked trousers and a grey Homburg hat. A colourful and restless personality, he enlivened one quiet evening by racing a guest to London, ramming the other man's car when he looked like losing; in August 1923, he courted publicity by challenging a fellow MP to a walking race from Banbury to Oxford in full infantry kit. After a period of illness, Gray went to South Africa to recuperate, but had a stroke on the return journey and died at sea on 3 March 1935. His coffin was carried on a flower-bedecked fire engine from Shipton Manor and he was buried at Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford, on 6 March 1935.<br>
