<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooke,  Thomas Simpson <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1782&#150;1848), <span class="occ">singer and composer</span>, was born in Dublin, and received his first musical instruction from his father, Bartlett Cooke, an oboist at the Smock Alley Theatre. He performed a violin concerto in public at the age of seven. He later studied composition with Tommaso Giordani, and in 1797 was engaged as leader of the orchestra at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, for which he composed several overtures and songs. He also kept a music shop from 1806 to 1812.<br>
<br>After several years Cooke's ambitions led him to appear in a new capacity, as a dramatic singer, and he chose for his d&eacute;but the role of the Seraskier in Storace's <span class="italic">The Siege of Belgrade</span>. His success was such that he sang the same part in London at the English Opera House at the Lyceum Theatre on 13 July 1813. On 14 September 1815 he began his long connection with the Drury Lane Theatre, when he appeared as Don Carlos in Linley's <span class="italic">The Duenna</span>. For almost twenty years he held the post of principal tenor, and from about 1821 he was director of music. During this period he composed music for more than fifty productions at the theatre, including a version of <span class="italic">Oberon</span> (1826). For some time, after about 1823, he appeared alternately as a singer and as orchestral leader. He was a member of the Philharmonic Society, and occasionally served as leader of the orchestra or conductor at its concerts. He also belonged to the Royal Academy of Music, though he was not one of the original members. From 1828 to 1830 he was one of the music managers of Vauxhall Gardens, and until 1838 he sang as principal tenor at the chapel of the Bavarian embassy in Warwick Street. He was engaged by Alfred Bunn to direct the music and conduct at both Covent Garden and Drury Lane.<br>
<br>Cooke adopted, with substitutions of his own, many successful foreign operas for the English stage, including <span class="italic">Abou Hassan</span> (Drury Lane, 4 April 1825), after Weber; <span class="italic">The White Lady</span> (Drury Lane, 9 October 1826), after Boieldieu; <span class="italic">The Jewess</span> (Drury Lane, 16 November 1835), based on Hal&eacute;vy; and <span class="italic">The Siege of Corinth</span> (Drury Lane, 8 November 1836), after Rossini. One of his last works for the stage was the vaudeville <span class="italic">The Follies of a Night</span>, with words by Planch&eacute;, which was first performed at Drury Lane on 5 October 1842. Of all his compositions, the song &#145;Love's Ritornella&#146;, from <span class="italic">The Brigand Chief</span> (Drury Lane, 18 November 1829), was perhaps his most popular. From about 1830 onwards he spent much of his time composing glees, and several examples of his works won prizes at the catch and glee clubs. <span class="italic">Six Glees for Three and Four Voices</span> were published in 1844, and others were issued individually. As early as 1828 he published a treatise entitled <span class="italic">Singing Exemplified in a Series of Solfeggi and Exercises, Progressively Arranged</span> (which was reviewed in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review</span> in that year), and he subsequently became a widely popular singing master. Among his many distinguished pupils were Maria Tree, Elizabeth Rainforth, and, perhaps the most eminent, John Sims Reeves (1818&#150;1900), whose first London appearance at Drury Lane in 1842 was made under the auspices of Cooke.<br>
<br>In 1846 Cooke was appointed leader for the final two years of the Concerts of Ancient Music, succeeding John David Loder in that capacity. He was renowned as a musician for his versatility; he played the violin, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, cello, double bass, and piano, and was also a man of great wit. He died on 26 February 1848 at his home in Great Portland Street, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. His eldest son, Henry Angelo Michael (Gratton) Cooke (1809&#150;1889), was a successful oboist and bandmaster.<br>
