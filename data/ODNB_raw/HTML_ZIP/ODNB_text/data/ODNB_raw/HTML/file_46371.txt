<span class="headword">Magens,  Nicholas</span>  (1697?&#150;1764), <span class="occ">merchant and author</span>, was born in Germany. Nothing is known about his parents, apart from the fact that they had six children, five sons and a daughter. Gaining early experience as a merchant in Hamburg and Spain, Magens settled in London in the early 1700s. There he became a successful insurance trader and director of the London Assurance Company. His earliest publication in English, <span class="italic">The Universal Merchant</span> (1753), was allegedly translated from German by William Horsley, although the German edition appeared only in 1762. This book started with a general treatise on trade, which according to Horsley reflected &#145;many of Mr [William] Woods Sentiments&#146;, followed by an enquiry concerning bullion and an exposition of the theory and practice of banking. The work established Magens's reputation as an authority on monetary and commercial matters. The political economist James Steuart, referring to him as Mr Megens, called him &#145;a very knowing man, and a very judicious author&#146; and quoted among other things his estimate of the amount of coin preserved in the Bank of England  (Steuart, 3.212). In the first book of <span class="italic">The Wealth of Nations</span> (1776) Adam Smith, spelling his name as &#145;Meggens&#146;, adopted from <span class="italic">The Universal Merchant</span> and from <span class="italic">Farther Explanations of Subjects</span> (1756) the estimates of the precious metals imported into Europe and into Spain respectively.<br>
<br>Magens's second influential study, <span class="italic">An Essay on Insurances</span> (1755), was a much amended and increased translation of his <span class="italic">Versuch &uuml;ber Assecuranzen</span> (1753). Additions in the English edition to the general treatise on insurance, with which volume 1 commences, include some interesting mathematical notes on the calculation of insurance premiums. Most of this volume, however, consisted of leading cases. The second volume was a collection of ordinances and laws on insurances from several European states and cities. Magens further demonstrated his detailed knowledge in commercial matters in a memorial and four letters to the duke of Newcastle written in the period 1758 to 1761. Advising on such matters as the best way to finance the provisioning of British troops in Germany, he showed that, as Horsley put it, he was &#145;an Alien by birth [but] an Englishman by Interest&#146;  (N. Magens, <span class="italic">The Universal Merchant</span>, preface).<br>
<br>That Magens did not neglect his own particular interest either is evinced by the considerable wealth he accumulated, estimated to be about &pound;100,000 at his death  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). In 1763, using some of this wealth, he became lord of the manor by buying Brightlingsea Hall and Moverons, the two manors of Brightlingsea, near Colchester. Not long after, on 18 August 1764, he died. He was buried in All Saints' Church, Brightlingsea, where upon the death of his wife, Elizabeth, in 1779 a sumptuous marble monument was erected to his memory. There is no evidence of any surviving child; his brother William held the manors from 1779.<br>
