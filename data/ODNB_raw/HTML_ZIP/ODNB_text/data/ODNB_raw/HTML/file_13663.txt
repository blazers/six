<span class="headword">Honner,  Robert William</span>  (1809&#150;1852), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, the youngest son of John Honner (<i>d</i>. 1817), solicitor, in the partnership of Fletcher and Honner, of the parish of St Anne, Soho, was born at 24 Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road, London, on 18 January 1809. He was educated at a private school at Pentonville, where Joseph Grimaldi the younger and Thomas Hamblin were his schoolfellows. His father gave up his profession to become proprietor of the Heathcock tavern, Heathcock Court, close to the Sans Pareil Theatre (later known as the Adelphi) in the Strand. There Robert Honner found opportunities for indulging his taste for theatricals. His father soon died, leaving his mother unprovided for.<br>
<br>In 1817 Honner was articled for three years to the ballet master Charles Leclercq, and shortly after appeared for his master's benefit at the Sans Pareil in a ballet called <span class="italic">The Crown of Roses</span>. In 1820 he went as a dancer with Kinloch to the Pantheon Theatre, Edinburgh, but the enterprise was a failure, and he was left destitute. He visited south and west England, then joined the corps de ballet at the Coburg Theatre, London, and in 1824 went to the Surrey. In 1825 Honner was again at the Coburg, and soon afterwards joined Andrew Ducrow, with whom he remained a long period, although he still undertook provincial tours, during which he played every character, from leading business to harlequin, clown, and pantaloon. He acted subsequently at Sadler's Wells under Grimaldi (1827), at the Surrey, first with R. W. Elliston and then with Charles Elliston and D. W. Osbaldiston, and at the Old City Theatre in Milton Street under Benjamin Webster (1829). At later dates he returned to the Coburg, was one of G. B. Davidge's company at Liverpool, was stage-manager for George Almar at Sadler's Wells (1833), and from 1835 to 1838 was lessee of Sadler's Wells, as well as acting-manager for Davidge at the Surrey. He also often appeared at the latter house at short notice for John Reeve, T. P. Cooke, and others who happened to be indisposed.<br>
<br>On 21 May 1836 Honner married the actress <a href="#cosubject_13662">Maria Macarthy [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and they appeared together at the Surrey until 1838. As lessee of Sadler's Wells from 1838 to 1840 Honner tried to establish a taste for the legitimate drama. He managed the Surrey from 1842 to 1846, and after a short lease of the City of London Theatre in Norton Folgate he joined John Douglass as stage-manager of the Standard Theatre, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Honner was a good actor, his chief roles being Richmond, Laertes in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Fag in Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">The Jew</span>, Scrooge the Miser in <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span>, and Jemmy Twitcher in <span class="italic">The Golden Farmer</span>. He died at his home, Nichols Square, Hackney Road, London, on 31 December 1852. His death was registered in the name Robert Walter Honner.<br>
<br>His wife, <a name="cosubject_13662"></a><span class="headword">Maria Honner</span>  (1808&#150;1870), <span class="occ">actress</span>, born at Enniskillen, Ireland, on 21 December 1808, was the daughter of Eugene Macarthy, actor&#150;manager, who died in the Dramatic College at Maybury, Surrey, on 14 May 1866, aged seventy-eight. She was educated at Cork and lost her mother at an early age. Being left to her own resources at her father's second marriage, with a younger brother to support, she made her first appearance on the stage at the age of fifteen, at a theatre in the south of Ireland. She afterwards played in Dublin, and as the hero of juvenile tragedy attracted the notice of Charles Kean and W. C. Macready. Her first important character was Rosalie Somers, which she played to Edmund Kean. An engagement in Scotland followed, and she became a popular favourite. In 1831 she was taken on by John Farrell for the Pavilion Theatre, London, where for two seasons she was the leading attraction. In 1833 she transferred her services to the Coburg Theatre, and, on the retirement of Davidge, the lessee, moved to Sadler's Wells, where Honner was the manager. After the termination of two successful seasons she went to the Surrey. In June 1835 she played Julia in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span> with great success at Drury Lane, for the benefit of &#145;Jerry-Sneak Russell&#146;. On 21 May 1836 she married Honner.<br>
<br>Maria Honner continued acting with her husband at the Surrey until Whitsuntide 1838, when he became lessee of Sadler's Wells; they played together at the latter house for about five years to much acclaim. At the request of Davidge she returned to the Surrey, where she remained until September 1845, and then went to the City of London Theatre. She was a good actress in pathetic roles, and after the retirement of Elizabeth Yates was for a time without a rival. She was excellent in many Shakespearian parts, as well as in the roles of Mary in <span class="italic">Paul the Pilot</span>, Susan in <span class="italic">The Kohal Cave</span>, Felix in <span class="italic">The French Revolution</span>, and Clemency in Dickens's <span class="italic">The Battle of Life</span>. She died of paralysis on 4 January 1870, at the residence of her second husband, Frederick Morton, stage-manager of the Charing Cross Theatre.<br>
