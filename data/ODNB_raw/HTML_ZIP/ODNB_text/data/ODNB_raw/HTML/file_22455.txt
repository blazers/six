<span class="headword">Pole,  Ralph</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1400, <em>d.</em> 1460), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the eldest son of Peter Pole (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1443) of Radbourne, Derbyshire, and Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Sir John Laughton and Eleanor, sister and heir of Sir John Chandos. Like his father he became a lawyer, and may have been educated at Lincoln's Inn. Ralph Pole had reached his majority by 1421, and was retained in 1439 as an apprentice-at-law by the duchy of Lancaster, the overlord of much of the Pole estate and employer of both his father and grandfather. Soon after he had become a serjeant-at-law, in 1443, he was named to a series of judicial posts for the duchy&#151;first in south Wales, and later at Lancaster, where he became chief justice in 1456. In 1452 he was appointed to the king's bench, and assigned to the northern assize circuit, where he also sat as a JP until his death. During the troubled 1450s he was a mainstay of the Lancastrian regime, raising loans for the defence of Calais, and holding sessions under special commissions appointed to quell disorder.<br>
<br>From 1436 onwards Pole collected fees from a number of private employers, including Henry Grey, Lord Grey of Codnor, James Butler, earl of Ormond and of Wiltshire (<i>d</i>. 1461), and Sir John Fastolf (<i>d</i>. 1459). He was also part of the team of legal counsel for the city of York in its dispute with St Mary's Abbey over navigational rights in the Ouse River. Humphrey, duke of Buckingham (<i>d</i>. 1460), retained him from 1443, and he also enjoyed the good lordship of John Talbot, second earl of Shrewsbury (<i>d</i>. 1460), and probably that of John Beaumont, Viscount Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1460). By 1452 he was a member of Queen Margaret's council, but did not share the queen's enmity towards the duke of York, with whom he held oyer and terminer sessions in Derby during the duke's first protectorate. Pole also sat with Justice Richard Bingham in sessions at York in November 1454, during which the Percys were fined for offences against the Nevilles. In April 1457, however, he attended the sessions held at Hereford where supporters of the Yorkist Sir William Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1469) were indicted, and remained a committed Lancastrian until his death.<br>
<br>Pole had inherited his father's large estate in Staffordshire and Derbyshire about 1443. With his wife, Joan, whom he had married by 1434, and who was the daughter of Sir Thomas Grosvenor of Hulme, Cheshire, he had a son, Ralph, and two daughters, Alice and Mary. The younger Ralph married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Reginald Motton of Peckleton, Leicestershire, by 1455, and Alice married John, son and heir of Nicholas Fynderne of Findern, Derbyshire, in 1450, after which the justice became closely involved in the legal affairs of that family. Justice Pole died in 1460, probably in the spring, and was buried in Radbourne church, where a tomb survives commemorating him and his wife.<br>
