</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kerr,  William</span>, third earl of Lothian  (<em>c.</em>1605&#150;1675), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15457/', "Robert Ker, first earl of Ancram (1578&#150;1654)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Sir John Murray of Blackbarony. Soon after James VI's accession to the throne of England, Robert Ker was appointed to the bedchamber of Prince Henry, and in 1613 he became gentleman of the bedchamber to Prince Charles. Thus William Kerr grew up around the court at St James's. He matriculated as a fellow-commoner from Queens' College, Cambridge, in Lent 1621. In March 1621 William's &#145;first chamber fellow&#146;, Patrick Curwen (future MP for Cumberland), left the college to get married, and Robert Ker wrote to console his son, and tell him that &#145;Your present business is your booke, and the place Cambridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.16). However, William does not seem to have graduated at the university, and we next hear of him in Paris, in April 1624, where he seems to have gone to complete his education. In November he left Paris to begin his grand tour and, after travelling through a number of French towns, visited Turin, Milan, Modena, Bologna, Florence, Siena, Rome, and Venice, and then returned to Paris via Switzerland. His journal of the tour is preserved in the Newbattle collection  (NL Scot., MS 5785). As a document of the Renaissance rather than the Reformation, the journal contains admiring descriptions of Italian cities and no disparaging remarks whatsoever about popery. He mentioned his visit to the Sistine Chapel, where &#145;Michaell Angelo&#146; had painted the last judgment, &#145;counted the best peace in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.xlvii).<br>
<br>On completing his education Kerr became a soldier, and raised a company of troops to take part in the duke of Buckingham's ill-fated expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; in 1627, during the war with France. In 1628 he participated in the equally unsuccessful attempt to relieve La Rochelle, sailing with the earl of Morton and the earl of Lindsay. In 1629 he fought for the Dutch against the Spanish when 's-Hertogenbosch was besieged by Henry, prince of Orange, and was present when the Spanish troops surrendered the town on 14 September after five months of resistance. In 1630 Kerr returned to Scotland, and on 9 December married Lady Anne (<i>d</i>. 1667), eldest daughter of the late Robert Ker, earl of Lothian and heir to the earldom, apparently to be inherited upon her marriage to one of the name of Kerr. Her father had left the Newbattle estates, to which she was heir, heavily in debt, but Sir Robert Ker, father of William, drew from his own estate to cancel the debts, and the lands were granted to William and his new wife. On 31 October 1631 William Kerr was created earl of Lothian and Lord Kerr of Newbattle. He received the patent from the privy council in January 1632. Over the next few years he lived a quiet domestic life. Between 1631 and 1654 his wife gave birth to nine daughters and five sons. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15465/', "Robert Kerr")</script>, was born in 1636, eventually succeeded his father as the fourth earl of Lothian, and was created marquess of Lothian in 1701.<br>
<br>In the mid-1630s Lothian maintained contact with disaffected noblemen such as Argyll, Rothes, and Balmerino, and on 20 September 1637 he signed the supplication against the service book. On 18 October Lothian and Rothes had to escort Bishop Sydserf through the streets of Edinburgh to protect him from anti-prayer book rioters. His father had urged him to &#145;carie my self warily in these bryles&#146;, and Lothian insisted that he had no intention of being &#145;mutinous&#146;. He prayed that &#145;God Almighty move the King's harte to gentlenes, and that he urge not on this church that that there is sutch a generall aversion to&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.96). In February 1638 he signed the national covenant, and in November he was chosen as a ruling elder for the presbytery of Dalkeith in the Glasgow general assembly. In March 1639 he was with the covenanting forces who captured Dalkeith House. He also raised a regiment of about 600 horse from Haddington and Jedburgh, and in June he was with the covenanting army at Duns. Following the treaty of Berwick, Lothian and five other covenanters were invited to meet the king at Berwick. Although he accepted the invitation, many were opposed to Lothian and Montrose visiting the king, since both were regarded as lukewarm covenanters whom the king might persuade to desert the cause. Lothian sat as a member of the Edinburgh general assembly in August, and in 1640 he played a full part in the second bishops' war, raising a regiment of 1200 men from Teviotdale. He was a colonel in the covenanting army that crossed the Tweed on 21 August, and on 31 August was appointed governor of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was later reported to be the author of <span class="italic">A true representation of the proceedings of the kingdome of Scotland since the late pacification</span> (1640). In letters to his father, he insisted that the covenanters were not acting in opposition to the king, and had &#145;noe thoughts of prejudice towards this Kingdome where we are&#146;. They had simply acted out of &#145;necessitie&#146;, and would &#145;never returne but with assurance to injoy our religion in puritie, and our nationall liberties&#146;. Although the covenanters would like England to &#145;gett a reformation like ours&#146;, they had not come south &#145;to reforme Church and State&#146;. &#145;We shall never refuse the King civill and temporall obedience; if more be demanded we can not give it, and in our lawful defence WE DARE DIE&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.104&#150;5).<br>
<br>Lothian remained at Newcastle until August 1641, when he returned to Edinburgh to attend parliament. Appointed to the privy council he was, in November, appointed one of parliament's commissioners to continue treaty negotiations with their English counterparts. In the wake of the Irish rising his remit, like that of his colleagues, was expanded to include Scottish military intervention in Ireland. He was appointed lieutenant-general of the Scottish army designed for Ireland, and colonel of a foot regiment which sailed on 24 April 1642 and remained there until February 1644. However, instead of accompanying his men to Ulster, Lothian was selected by the privy council in December 1642 to go on an embassy to France, with royal approval, with regard to France's Scots guard. He set sail on 21 January 1643, and though the mission was delayed at first, it went successfully. By 27 September he was back in London. When he returned to the king at Oxford to report on his embassy, he was arrested for suspected treachery and eventually imprisoned in Bristol Castle, where he almost died from illness. On 3 January 1644 the committee of estates in Edinburgh passed an act approving his mission to France, and the English House of Commons also passed resolutions calling for his release. He was finally released in exchange for Sir Charles Goring in March 1644. The earl of Clarendon claimed that from this day forwards Lothian &#145;continued amongst those who upon all occasions, carried the rebellion highest, and shewed the most implacable malice to the person of the King&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.383). Burnet added that despite his father's loyal service, Lothian was &#145;ever much hated by the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 1.28).<br>
<br>Lothian was present at the Edinburgh parliament in June, and on 17 July an act was passed ordering compensation for his expenses and losses incurred during his diplomatic mission. On 4 September he left Edinburgh to rejoin his regiment, now engaged in the pursuit of Montrose, but he refused to take command of the covenanter expedition after Argyll's resignation. His regiment lost at least 375 men at the battle of Auldearn on 9 May, contributing little to the war effort thereafter. In July and August Lothian took an active part in the sessions of parliament. In early 1646 he was named to that section of the committee of estates assigned to attend the Scottish army in England, and he was with General Leslie's forces when Charles I arrived at Newark in May. Later he received an order to go to treat with the king at Newcastle, and when Charles was given up to the English, Lothian attended him to Holmby House in February 1647. He opposed the engagement of December 1647, and became a key figure in the kirk party government after the defeat of the engagers in August 1648. In December 1648 he and two others were sent to London to uphold Scottish interests. They protested against the trial of Charles I and wrote to the Commons and to Fairfax and Cromwell in a futile attempt to halt proceedings against the king. On 24 February they presented a paper to the English parliament condemning the regicide and the alteration of government, and upholding Charles II. Clarendon condemned this as a &#145;very calm protestation&#146;, and claimed that they were under orders from Argyll not to offend the English regime or give &#145;a ground of a new war&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.7&#150;11). However, the Commons placed guards on their lodgings, and when they tried to follow the orders of the Scottish parliament and sail to the Netherlands to see Charles II, they were arrested and imprisoned at Gravesend, then taken to Berwick and detained there, before finally being allowed to return to Scotland.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1649 Lothian was made secretary of state, a position he nominally held until the Restoration. He was also among the commissioners sent to Charles II at The Hague in March 1650. Another commissioner, the minister John Livingstone, later complained that Lothian had been too conciliatory towards Charles because he was worried that the king would not come to Scotland if he heard all the covenanters' demands. The conciliatory approach succeeded in that Charles landed at Aberdeen on 23 June 1650, but in the wake of the covenanters' defeat at Dunbar, Lothian and others were condemned by a remonstrance of the synod of Fife for their &#145;crooked ways&#146; in the negotiations with the king in the Netherlands  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.xcv). Lothian and Argyll were now caught between those who wanted more purging of persons considered unworthy allies in the cause of the covenants, and those who wanted to readmit engagers to the army. On 1 January 1651 two of Lothian's sons were among the train bearers as Charles II was crowned at Scone. In March, with other covenanter nobles, Lothian argued for four hours with the king against readmitting the Hamiltons and other engagers to the army. With the final defeat of Charles and the Scots at Worcester, Lothian's days as a high-profile politician came to a close. Throughout the 1650s he resided at Newbattle, apart from a number of months between June 1655 and May 1656 in London, where he tried in vain to gain compensation for the expenses he had incurred on public business. Although there were rumours that he was inclined &#145;to take employment&#146; under the protectorate  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Laing, 150), this did not happen. In 1660 he travelled to London, where he had an interview with the king and presented a paper defending his conduct since 1637. He was forced to resign as secretary of state, and though he was given a pension of &pound;1000, this does not seem to have been paid in full. On 27 July 1661 he accompanied Argyll to the scaffold, along with his eldest son, who had married Argyll's daughter. Lothian refused to abjure the covenants and was fined &pound;6000 in 1662. Despite the efforts of friends, the fines were not reduced, and he insisted that he could not afford to pay. On 5 August 1665 he assigned his estates to his son Robert, Lord Kerr of Newbattle, retaining only &#145;a mean portion&#146; of life-rent. Because of his dire financial situation he was also forced to sell Ancram House. His wife died on 25 March 1667, and from this point little information about Lothian survives. He himself died in October 1675 at Newbattle Abbey.<br>
<br>Lothian's letters and personal manuscripts provide us with privileged access to his mentality. In contrast to Wariston, Lothian was no fervent militant, though his Calvinist piety was genuine. He reflected on approaching communion with &#145;true fayth in the promyse of salvation through the alone meryts of Jesus Chryst&#146;  (NL Scot., &#145;Miscellanies, or, Commonplace book&#146;, Newbattle MS 5788, fol. 9), and referred occasionally to election, &#145;the covenant of grace&#146;, and the necessity of divine revelation  (NL Scot., &#145;Maxims&#146;, Newbattle MS 5787, fols. 3&#150;4, 60&#150;60<i>r</i>). When his wife died, he looked forward to her resurrection, and wrote, &#145;I kisse the rodde. I stoope and lay my selfe loue under His mighty hand, whoe doth every thing well&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 480). He wrote enthusiastically of the &#145;excellent sermons&#146; of the fiery puritan Stephen Marshall  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 192&#150;3), though his favourite preacher was the eirenic minister of Newbattle, Robert Leighton, who became a bishop after the Restoration. When Leighton resigned his charge in 1652 Lothian wrote that this would be &#145;a great griefe to me, for never did I gett soe mutch good by any that stoode in a pulpitt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 373). Although Lothian refused to abjure the covenants after 1660, he did not oppose the established church, and continued to act as patron of parish churches.<br>
<br>Lothian was also a sophisticated connoisseur of Renaissance culture. He collected many paintings for Newbattle Abbey and made impressive alterations to the property. In 1666 he listed 1361 books in his library catalogue, the vast majority of which he had collected himself  (NL Scot., Newbattle MS 5818). The largest proportion were in French, and many others were in Latin or Italian, with only a few in English. The catalogue lists only a very small number of theological books, such as Bayly's <span class="italic">Practice of Piety</span> and Owen's <span class="italic">Communion with God</span>. Instead, the collection was rich in humanist works of history, philosophy, geography, politics, and even science. Besides classical works by Homer, Virgil, Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus, Lothian had also acquired the writings of Machiavelli, Lipsius, Montaigne, Bacon, and Rabelais. His unpublished maxims reflect the influence of such authors, for they reveal his love of history and revolve around the key humanist concepts of virtue, honour, prudence, moderation, public good, and peace  (NL Scot., Newbattle MS 5787). Lothian does not fit the stereotype of the covenanter as bigoted presbyterian zealot. His allegiance to the covenanters reminds us of the diversity of the movement which the ineptitude of Charles I's Scottish policies in the 1630s had produced.<br>
