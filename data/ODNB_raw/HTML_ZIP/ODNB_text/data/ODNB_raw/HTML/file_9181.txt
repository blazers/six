<span class="headword">Farquhar, Sir  Walter</span>, first baronet  (1738&#150;1819), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in October 1738, was son of Robert Farquhar (1699&#150;1787), minister of Garioch in Scotland, and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1798), daughter of Walter Turing, minister of Rayne. He was educated first at King's College, Aberdeen, where he remained for four years and took the degree of MA. It was in Aberdeen that he started to study medicine under James Gregory; but in 1759 he left for Edinburgh, where, as well as in Glasgow, he continued his medical studies. Without graduating in medicine Farquhar entered the Army Medical Service, being appointed to the 19th regiment, and took part in Lord Howe's expedition against Belle &Icirc;le off the coast of Brittany in 1761. As his regiment was stationed for a long time in Gibraltar, he obtained leave of absence, and spent nearly eighteen months in France, attending the hospitals in Paris and elsewhere. For several months he lived with and studied under Claude Nicolas le Cat, a celebrated anatomist and surgeon of Rouen. Farquhar returned to Gibraltar, but resigned from the army in August 1769, owing to ill health, and settled in London, where he began to practise as an apothecary in Great Marlborough Street. He was very successful, and his practice gradually became that of a physician. Shortly after settling in London he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1793), the widow of Dr Harvie, a physician, and the fourth daughter of Thomas Stephenson of Barbados; they had three sons and four daughters. Their second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9180/', "Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar")</script>, governor and commander-in-chief of Mauritius.<br>
<br>After obtaining the degree of MD from Aberdeen on 29 January 1796, Farquhar became a fellow of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh on 3 May 1796, and licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, on 30 September in the same year. He was created a baronet on 1 March 1796, and was shortly afterwards appointed physician-in-ordinary to the prince of Wales. This did wonders for Farquhar's professional reputation and he soon had a high-class clientele that included William Pitt and Lord Melville. In 1813 Farquhar partially withdrew from practice, and he died on 30 March 1819 in London, after suffering respiratory problems. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.<br>
<br>Farquhar was considered a very able and successful physician, a judgement, it appears, based on his personal qualities rather than his contributions to medical knowledge, which were few, if any.<br>
