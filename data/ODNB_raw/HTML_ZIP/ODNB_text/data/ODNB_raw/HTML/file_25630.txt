<span class="headword">Sinclair,  Oliver</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1576), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was a younger son of Sir Oliver Sinclair (<i>fl</i>. 1476&#150;1523) of Roslin and one of his three wives. He had at least seven brothers, of whom William succeeded to the family estates, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25621/', "Henry Sinclair (1507/8&#150;1565)")</script> became a judge and bishop of Ross and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25624/', "John Sinclair")</script> a judge, and also one sister. The younger Oliver made a career as a &#145;familiar servant&#146; of James V, being first recorded as receiving his livery in 1536, when he accompanied the king to France, apparently keeping the accounts of expenditure from the royal purse. In June 1537 his services were rewarded with the barony of Pitcairn in Perthshire; contemporary documents often refer to him under this territorial designation, although in January 1545 he sold Pitcairn to Henry Drummond of Riccarton. In 1538 he became a royal cup-bearer, and with the treasurer, James Kirkcaldy of Grange, was jointly granted the ward of the earldom of Caithness, the third earl, Oliver's first cousin, having been killed at the battle of Summerdale in 1529. He acquired the barony of Whitekirk in Haddingtonshire from Holyrood Abbey in 1539; the old barn adjacent to the parish church may incorporate the remains of Sinclair's tower house. In 1540 he was granted Tantallon Castle in feu-ferme. Tantallon, an important castle on the coast of Haddingtonshire, was a seat of the earl of Angus, who was then in exile in England. Sinclair was required to supervise building works there. In 1541 he was given a three-year tack of Orkney and Shetland, extended to 1547, along with the keeping of Kirkwall Castle and justiciary powers.<br>
<br>Sinclair is represented in contemporary accounts as a great favourite of James V, one of a small group (which included some senior churchmen) responsible for persuading the king not to meet Henry VIII at York in the summer of 1541, but rather to pursue war against England. Scottish historians writing from a protestant viewpoint see him as an unworthy councillor, pursuing policies in support of the old church. When war with England came late in 1542, Sinclair was apparently appointed to lead the army which came to grief at Solway Moss. Sinclair's role as army commander has given rise to some controversy, and it has been argued that he was not leader at all, but that the story of his appointment was developed after the battle to blacken James's character and discredit ecclesiastical influence on royal policies. There are only one or two indications that Sinclair had previously acted in a military capacity on the king's behalf, taking the English prisoners captured at the battle of Hadden Rigg near Kelso (24 August 1542) back to Edinburgh, and going to Hume Castle in Berwickshire in November 1542, apparently to discuss military tactics with the gentlemen of the region. It was certainly unusual for anyone but a magnate, or the king himself, to lead an army, but Sinclair is described as chief captain of the army, and as having lost the king's banner at Solway Moss, in a letter which was written only a few days after the battle by Sir George Douglas, the earl of Angus's younger brother. Early Scottish historians are consistent in their agreement. Contemporary English sources, notably the full report given by Sir William Musgrave, who was one of the English leaders, do not comment on the Scottish command structure. It is true that the imperial and Venetian ambassadors in London believed that Lord Maxwell was commander, but the latter, at least, were keen to present Maxwell as a heretic deliberately engineering the defeat out of spite against the policies of a government led by Cardinal Beaton.<br>
<br>It is clear that James V did not intend to lead his forces into England, and therefore command must have been delegated to others. If Sir George Douglas is to be believed about Sinclair having the king's banner at Solway Moss, this must be seen as a sign that he was in overall charge of the men there, even if Maxwell was more experienced and on home territory as warden of the Scottish west march. The Scottish forces called out in late November for a raid against the English, perhaps 14,000 men in all, were not marshalled as a single army. On the evidence of the reports of English spies, the Scots had two armies in the field, and it was probably only one of these&#151;the smaller of the two&#151;which advanced into England on 24 November. They were caught at Solway Moss, just inside Cumberland, by an English force about 2000&#150;3000 strong, and were soundly beaten. Sinclair himself was taken prisoner, as were his brothers Alexander and James and a number of Scottish nobles, including the earls of Glencairn and Cassillis and lords Maxwell, Somerville, and Oliphant. As with many battles, accounts of what happened are rather confused, but perhaps the most plausible explanation is that the Scots allowed themselves to be manoeuvred by the English light horse into a tight space flanked by marshy ground and with the River Esk behind them.<br>
<br>Contemporary English accounts, though jubilant about the outcome of the engagement, do not make much of the disparity in size between the opposing armies, as they surely would have done had it been notable. From their point of view it was fitting revenge for the earlier Scottish victory at Hadden Rigg, not a turning point or major achievement. Scottish historians have accused the Scottish nobles at Solway Moss of giving up without a fight, since they were so disgusted at Sinclair's appointment over them, but the report by Sir William Musgrave specifically states that Lord Maxwell with many other noblemen and courtiers fought valiantly. Once captured, Maxwell requested permission to speak with Sinclair&#151;was this a subordinate looking for a lead from his superior? James V is said to have been devastated by Sinclair's capture but did not live to receive a firsthand report from him on the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, dying before Sinclair was released from captivity early in 1543.<br>
<br>Sinclair seems to have played little part in national affairs for the rest of his life, though he is referred to as involved in border skirmishing in 1543, and seems to have remained on good terms with Cardinal Beaton, receiving a charter from him in 1546. Sinclair married twice. His first wife, apparently married by 1542, was Katherine Bellenden, sister of Sir Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoull and previously the wife of Adam Hopper, provost of Edinburgh, and of Francis Bothwell, provost of Edinburgh and lord of session. They had three children, Henry, who succeeded to Whitekirk, Oliver, and Isabella. Katherine had died by January 1568, and Sinclair later married Beatrice Rollo or Rollock, probably a daughter of Robert Rollo of Duncrub. He also had a natural son named James, who was legitimated in January 1539. Sinclair was presumably dead by 20 April 1576, when Beatrice was granted the life rent of the mains of Whitekirk with the advice of the curators of her stepson Henry.<br>
