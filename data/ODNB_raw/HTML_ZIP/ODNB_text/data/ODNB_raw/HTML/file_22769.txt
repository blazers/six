<span class="headword">Price, Sir  Uvedale</span>, first baronet  (1747&#150;1829), <span class="occ">writer and rural improver</span>, was born at Foxley, in the parish of Yazor, Herefordshire, where he was baptized on 14 April 1747. He was the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_56849"></a><span class="headword">Robert Price</span>  (1717&#150;1761), <span class="occ">a gentleman artist</span>, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1759), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1531/', "John Shute Barrington, first Viscount Barrington")</script>.<h2>
<a name="RobertPrice"></a>Robert Price</h2>Robert Price was the son of Uvedale Tomkins Price (1685&#150;1764) and his wife, Anne, the daughter of Lord Arthur Somerset. He made a grand tour in 1738 and was taught to draw in Rome by Giovanni Battista Busiri, one of whose sketchbooks he once owned and which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Of his many sketches, a number are in public collections (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth); his <span class="italic">Castle Mount at Foxley, 1744</span> showing the &#145;Ragged Castle&#146;, an early example of the Gothic revival, is in Hereford Library. Price was a friend of the artists Thomas Jones and John Baptist Malchair, while Gainsborough was on good terms with three generations of the Price family. With the naturalist Benjamin Stillingfleet, Price made sketching excursions, in search of picturesque scenery, down the Wye valley and into Wales. He drew the plates for Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Observations on Grasses</span> (1762) and also &#145;laid a scheme of improvement &hellip; which when executed will make Foxley vye with any place&#146;  (Lambin, 252). He planted ornamental trees, developed new woods, and created &#145;walks or rather rides &hellip; diversify'd with different prospects&#146;  (ibid.). In 1824 John Claudius Loudon could still distinguish the oak, beech, and elm, planted by Robert, from the introductions of his son. Robert Price married Sarah Barrington in June 1746. He was buried at Yazor on 1 October 1761.<h2>
<a name="UvedalePriceearlylifeandestatemanagement"></a>Uvedale Price: early life and estate management</h2>Uvedale Price was educated at Eton College and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1763. He became friendly with the whig politician Charles James Fox (1749&#150;1806), and in the autumn of 1767 they travelled to Florence and then to Rome, Venice, Turin, and Geneva. While passing through Perugia, Price purchased six drawings by Salvator Rosa, whose work epitomizes sublime landscape. In August 1768 they paid a visit to Voltaire at Ferney.<br>
<br>Price probably took control of Foxley soon after his return from his grand tour, and in 1772&#150;3 alterations were made to the house on the advice of the fashionable architect Robert Adam. On 28 April 1774 Price married Lady Caroline Carpenter (<i>d</i>. 1826), the youngest daughter of George, first earl of Tyrconnel, whose family were well connected with Herefordshire. They had a son, Robert (<i>d</i>. 1857), and a daughter, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1853). A survey of Foxley carried out in 1775 by the professional land agent Nathaniel Kent (1737&#150;1810) recorded that it was 3537 acres in extent and provided its owner with an income of &pound;2461. Kent transferred much tenanted woodland to Price, but also recommended, contrary to the current trend, retaining a large number of smallholders and cottagers. Price was a conscientious landowner, farming profitably but at the same time conscious of the aesthetic bonus produced by meticulous management guided by a discriminating eye. Like Joseph Addison and Alexander Pope earlier in the century, he saw no reason why a whole estate should not please the eye, rather than just the pleasure grounds around the house. Indeed, Price had little interest in the picturesque but sterile landscapes of the more rugged parts of Britain, popularized by such tourists as William Gilpin, or the new parklands laid out by Capability Brown. Instead, he celebrated landscapes which were &#145;flourishing, populous, domesticated and needed to be worked industriously to keep them so&#146;  (Daniels and Watkins, 161). Price condemned the improving landowner who, perhaps aided by Capability Brown, lived within a ring-fence of shelter belts, isolated from his tenantry. He believed that Britain could escape the horrors of the French Revolution if the landowning classes espoused the concept of &#145;connection&#146;, maintaining their links, both socially and economically, with the lower classes. These ideas were developed in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Defence of Property</span>, printed in Hereford in 1797, on the occasion of the French landing on the Pembrokeshire coast.<h2>
<a name="TheEssaysandthepicturesquecontroversy"></a>The Essays and the picturesque controversy</h2>Price's indignation at what he regarded as the &#145;false taste&#146; purveyed by Capability Brown and his many imitators, such as the &#145;mechanic improvers&#146; Richard Woods and William Emes, was expressed in the <span class="italic">Essay on the Picturesque</span> (1794). This work was long in gestation, and Price sent various drafts to his friends, including Fox and the collector and amateur landscape painter Sir George Beaumont, for their comments. The <span class="italic">Essay</span> celebrated localism and the diversity of the English landscape in all its forms, epitomized in the phrase &#145;intricacy and variety&#146;. Price feared that a new uniformity was being imposed upon the countryside because modern improvers were replacing &#145;intricacy in disposition, and variety of forms, the tints and the lights and shadows of objects&#146; with &#145;monotony and baldness [which] are the greatest defects of improved places&#146;  (Price, 1.22&#150;3). Brown had been consulted at well over 250 estates in Britain, where he had deployed the same elements&#151;belts of trees, clumps, serpentine lakes and drives, and endless acres of lawn&#151;which ignored the singularity of each landscape. Roughness and ruggedness had been banished for acres of smooth turf.<br>
<br>Essentially, the <span class="italic">Essay</span> promoted in measured terms the more radical view of the picturesque landscape voiced by Richard Payne Knight in <span class="italic">The Landscape: a Didactic Poem, Addressed to Uvedale Price</span>, also published in 1794. Both authors argued that landscaping was safer in the hands of men of liberal education who understood the character of their own estates. Price, in particular, wished to revive the role of the amateur gardener&#151;such as William Shenstone and Charles Hamilton&#151;who eschewed the borrowed taste of a professional landscaper who, after a brief visit to an estate, in a remote part of the country&#151;such as his native Herefordshire&#151;would make inappropriate improvements. Like Knight, he believed that the sensitivity of the amateur improver was enhanced by a knowledge and understanding of the paintings of Claude, Poussin, and Salvator Rosa. These paintings, set in a rugged classical landscape, where nature was about to engulf the works of man, provided a variety of vignettes, which could be used as a corrective in the late eighteenth-century countryside. Price was conscious that this was being damaged not only by professional landscapers but also by new agricultural practices, industry, and even the turnpike roads. It was this reaffirmation of the role of great art in moulding the countryside which underpinned Price's version of the picturesque. As his taste was more catholic and domestic than Knight's, Price also recommended the paintings of the seventeenth-century Dutch school, such as those of Ruisdael. In every painting there were object lessons for the amateur landscaper, who with sensitivity and imagination could create similar &#145;pictures&#146; on his estate without sacrificing its productive capacity.<br>
<br>In addition to promoting a more painterly approach to the landscape, Price sought to give greater definition to the much-abused term &#145;picturesque&#146;, which had become a descriptive commonplace in the eighteenth century&#151;<i>pittoresco</i> being &#145;after the manner of painters&#146;. Price believed that the picturesque existed between Edmund Burke's categories of the &#145;beautiful&#146; and the &#145;sublime&#146;: &#145;When I first read that original work [<span class="italic">Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</span>, 1756], I felt that there were numberless objects which gave delight to the eye and yet differed as widely from the beautiful as from the sublime&#146;  (Price, 1.43). Whereas the beautiful was characterized by smoothness and freshness, the picturesque had the opposite qualities of roughness and decay. Similarly, the sublime, with its characteristics of greatness and infinity, was the antithesis of the picturesque's intricacy and variety. Price was equally unhappy with William Gilpin's category of &#145;picturesque beauty&#146;, which he applied to landscapes that were beautiful and yet would make good pictures. Price expanded the discussion of his theory in <span class="italic">A Dialogue on the Distinct Characters of the Picturesque and the Beautiful</span> (1801), which was subject to a forthright attack by Knight in <span class="italic">An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste</span> (1805). Price's theory, although going beyond Burke, had followed the latter, as well as Hogarth, in believing that the aesthetic categories he described were inherent in objects themselves, whereas Knight, exploiting the views of David Hume, thought that they were simply in the mind of the beholder.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> and his letters are an excellent guide to the application of Price's ideas. He admitted to George Beaumont that he spent his time at Foxley &#145;trying the effect of my own principles&#146;. In another revealing letter he described a moment of picturesque creativity:<blockquote>It has been ingeniously said &hellip; that in every block of marble a fine statue is enclosed; you have only to clear away the rubbish: so it is with such a place as this; there are pictures in every tangled wood and thicket when the rubbish is removed: but what does, or does not constitute rubbish, is a very nice point: you must not destroy the appearance of intricacy and wildness in the near parts, nor injure the mass and general outline from the distance, and must take special care, while you are clearing, to make one picture, not to sacrifice others in the neighbourhood.</blockquote>For Price the spade and the axe were the landscaper's tools, and although they were coarse instruments they could be used to picturesque effect &#145;when working under the eye of a painter, and guided by his potent art&#146;. Like the artist, once the outline of the composition had been achieved, he looked to his palette&#151;&#145;the improver's palet is his nursery&#146;  (Allentuck, 73&#150;5).<br>
<br>During the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first of the nineteenth, the picturesque controversy was debated both in writing and in the salons of polite society throughout the country. Several critics, such as George Mason, William Marshall, and Horace Walpole, writing during the climax of the French Revolution, failed to distinguish between Price's practical &#145;landscape husbandry&#146; and the &#145;Jacobinical&#146; gardening recommended by Knight  (Ballantyne, &#145;Turbulence and repression&#146;, 66). Both Mason and Walpole had aired criticisms of Brown's system at an earlier date, but in the 1790s, perhaps through affection for the memory of Brown, they defended his reputation. Unfortunately for Price, the picturesque ideal was absorbed into the political milieu and taken as a symptom of the social anarchy released in France. The critics claimed that the promoters of the picturesque, by espousing &#145;undressed nature&#146;, were attacking the tastes of the &#145;folks of high degree&#146; who enjoyed the convenience and obvious charms of the Brownian landscape and, instead, they were championing a revolution in the countryside. This was a parody of Knight's <span class="italic">The Landscape</span> and unfair to Price, and yet there was a grain of truth in it. Both Price and Knight were strongly committed whigs. Price supported his friend Fox against the tory prime minister William Pitt, circulating in 1796 several epigrams &#145;somewhat splenetic&#146; against the government's excessive expenditure  (Owen and Brown, 90). This was a traditional whig position, but in the context of the war could be interpreted as radical and unpatriotic.<br>
<br>Jane Austen was also fully conversant with the nuances of the picturesque debate and parodied Gilpin in <span class="italic">Northanger Abbey</span>, while in <span class="italic">Mansfield Park</span> her sympathies are certainly with Price. Thomas Love Peacock, in <span class="italic">Headlong Hall</span> (1816), produced some knockabout scenes between the characters Sir Patrick O'Prism, representing Price, and Mr Milestone, representing the landscape gardener Humphry Repton. The debate clearly impinged upon the professional aspirations of Repton, who quickly went into print with <span class="italic">Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening</span> (1795), in which he denied the affinity between gardening and painting suggested by Price on the premise that the landscape gardener's creativity was much more restricted than the artist's. Repton had also defended the merits of his profession in a &#145;Letter to Uvedale Price&#146; (1794), where he revealed that he had spent &#145;pleasant hours&#146; with Price &#145;amidst the romantic scenery of the Wye&#146;  (Price, 3.5). Price replied in a &#145;Letter to H. Repton&#146; (1795), and both letters were published with a further three essays in 1798. Finally, all the <span class="italic">Essays</span> were collected in a three-volume edition issued in 1810. An extended edition entitled <span class="italic">Sir Uvedale Price and the Picturesque</span> was published in 1842 edited by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder.<h2>
<a name="Pricesinfluence"></a>Price's influence</h2>Once the heat of the controversy had faded, Price's original contribution to landscape gardening was generally acknowledged by contemporaries and later generations. Towards the end of his career, even Repton, under pressure from his clients, accommodated the picturesque canons in his layouts, as is evident in the <span class="roman">Red Books</span> for Hewell, Worcestershire (1811), and Endsleigh, Devon (1814). In his &#145;Memoir&#146;, Repton referred to Price and Knight as those &#145;ingenious authors&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 62112, &#145;Memoir&#146;, 212). The landscape gardener W. S. Gilpin presented himself to his clients as the person who could render Price's <span class="italic">Essays</span> &#145;practically useful&#146;  (Gilpin, <span class="italic">Practical Hints upon Landscape Gardening</span>, 1832, vi), while, for John Claudius Loudon, Price was &#145;the great reformer of landscape gardening&#146; of whom he was a &#145;profound admirer and disciple&#146;  (M. Simo, <span class="italic">Loudon and the Landscape</span>, 1988, 93). Edward Kemp, writing in 1850, still felt that &#145;The work of Sir U. Price on the Picturesque is probably the most valuable thing of its kind in our language&#146;  (Kemp, <span class="italic">How to Lay Out a Garden</span>, x). Finally, the American landscape gardener Frederick Olmsted visited Herefordshire in 1850 with the specific intention of soaking up the countryside which nurtured Uvedale Price.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essays</span> were not only a practical handbook for professional gardeners, but also a manifesto for a new movement in painting&#151;&#145;an ideology for British romanticism&#146;  (J. Murdoch, <span class="italic">David Cox, 1783&#150;1859</span>, 1983, 12). Thomas Hearne responded in the 1790s to Price's theory by his rejection of prospects and espousal of intimate scenes. David Cox went to live in Herefordshire in 1814 because it was the county of the picturesque, and his adoption of &#145;the broken tint style&#146; was designed to capture the texture of the countryside admired by Price. Cox painted a <span class="italic">Scene at Foxley Park</span> which was engraved by G. Hunt in 1823, and one of his pupils, while he was living in Hereford, was Charlotte Price&#151;perhaps Uvedale Price's niece.<br>
<br>The &#145;Essay on architecture&#146; in volume 2 of the <span class="italic">Essays</span> was equally influential, especially for its assessment of buildings in the landscape. Lord Aberdeen, who corresponded with Price, made several references to it in <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Principles of Beauty in Grecian Architecture</span> (1822), while architects providing designs for <i>orn&eacute;e</i> cottages, such as P. F. Robinson (1776&#150;1858) and Edward Bartell, derived credibility by referring to &#145;Mr. Price's ingenious <span class="italic">Essay</span>&#146;  (E. Bartell, <span class="italic">Hints for Picturesque Improvements</span>, 1804, 76).<h2>
<a name="AberystwythandvisitorstoFoxley"></a>Aberystwyth and visitors to Foxley</h2>In 1794 Price built a seaside house at Aberystwyth&#151;the Castle House&#151;designed by the then relatively unknown architect John Nash. Here Nash was inducted &#145;into the mystery of the Picturesque&#146; by Price and subsequently carried the style with him into metropolitan improvements in London  (J. Summerson, <span class="italic">John Nash</span>, 1980, 21). Eventually, a synthesis of Nash and Loudon produced the picturesque Victorian suburb, perhaps Price's most abiding legacy. Nash also produced delectable cottages, some of the earliest for Price, which became the essence of Arcadian dreams in the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essays</span> and the picturesque controversy brought many visitors to Foxley. Fox came about 1785 and admired Price's planting. The antiquary and topographer John Britton was &#145;eager and curious to have a personal view of the homes of the literary belligerents&#146;  (J. Britton, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1850, 150) and visited Foxley on a walking tour in 1798. Writing in 1850, he felt he could detect a &#145;palpable contrast&#146;  (ibid.) between the landscape at Foxley and the pleasure grounds laid out elsewhere by Repton. Perhaps the most flattering reference to Foxley comes from France and occurs in Jacques Delille's much printed work <span class="italic">Les jardins</span> (1801). Delille recommended Foxley as a model for the improvement of rural estates  (<span class="italic">Les jardins</span>, 12). In 1799 James Plumtre was impressed by the &#145;Forest Scenery&#146; at Foxley with its under wood of holly, thorns, and brambles. He also noticed some more conventional aspects of Price's pleasure grounds, such as the small flower garden at the back of the house, with its creeping and trailing plants, the conservatory, and rustic alcove. Nearby there was a menagerie and beside a pond a cool grotto  (I. Ousby, ed., <span class="italic">James Plumtre's Britain</span>, 1992). Among other notable visitors to Foxley were the dramatist Richard Sheridan, the poet Samuel Rogers, Sir George Beaumont, and William Combe, the author of <span class="italic">Dr Syntax</span>. Wordsworth visited Foxley in 1810 but felt that Price had become too &#145;delicate and fastidious&#146; in his picture making and, notwithstanding the emphasis of its owner upon &#145;connection&#146;, found the estate &#145;lacked the relish of humanity&#146;  (Daniels and Watkins, 163). Price admired Wordsworth's poetry and thought his <span class="italic">Scenery of the Lakes</span> (1820) should be regarded as &#145;the manual for improvers in every part of the kingdom&#146;  (Owen and Brown, 201). Price and Wordsworth collaborated on the quarry garden at Coleorton, Leicestershire, laid out for Sir George Beaumont. Price gave informal advice on gardening and tree planting to many of his friends. For example, he provided plants and helped with the design of a new walk at Fox's house near Isleworth, on the outskirts of London. It has been suggested by Denis Lambin that Eywood and Whitfield in Herefordshire, Cassiobury in Hertfordshire, Packington Hall and Guy's Cliffe in Warwickshire, and Bentley Priory in Stanmore, London, all received his attention.<h2>
<a name="Localinfluence"></a>Local influence</h2>Price's well-publicized association with Knight and his whiggism created a certain detachment from his fellow gentry in Herefordshire. One of them, Dr John Matthews of Belmont, near Hereford, was prepared to challenge the picturesque point of view in print with <span class="italic">A Sketch from the Landscape</span> (1794). Another neighbour, Thomas Symonds of the Mynde, was very self-conscious about employing a local gardener in &#145;the county where Mr. U. Price and Mr. Rd. Payne Knight (the first gentlemen professors) reside&#146;  (NL Wales, Mynde Park, 2473). Several of Price's neighbours also employed Repton, who expressed his surprise on being consulted by James Hereford of Sufton Court in 1795, in the &#145;enemy's quarters&#146;  (<span class="roman">Red Book</span>, Sufton Court). Price could, however, be a generous neighbour. Sarah Harford Jones, newly married, living close to Foxley at Mansel Lacy in 1798, and left alone with difficult servants by her husband, who was travelling in Persia for the East India Company, found Price and his wife very civil and attentive; dancing was provided at Foxley, gardening advice proffered, and a holiday suggested at the Castle House, Aberystwyth.<h2>
<a name="FriendshipwithElizabethBarrettBrowning"></a>Friendship with Elizabeth Barrett (Browning)</h2>In 1826 Price, nearly eighty years old, struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Barrett (Browning), the twenty-year-old poet of Hope End, near Ledbury. Price was impressed by her <span class="italic">Essay on the Mind, with other Poems</span> (1826), and a dialogue ensued. Barrett visited Foxley, discussed the poetry of George Crabbe with Price, and found herself being asked to read and criticize the proof sheets for Price's last publication, <span class="italic">An Essay on the Modern Pronunciation of the Greek and Latin Language</span> (1827), a work which Wordsworth regarded as &#145;most ingenious &hellip; If he be right, we have all been wrong, and I think he is&#146;  (Hewlett, 38). Elizabeth Barrett wrote subsequently that &#145;Mr. Price's friendship has given me more continual happiness than any other single circumstance ever did&#146;  (ibid., 39). On Price's death two years later she wrote a poem &#145;To the Memory of Sir Uvedale Price, Bart&#146; (1829). She recommended reading the <span class="italic">Essay on the Picturesque</span> for the &#145;sake of its style &hellip; natural, chaste and humorous to a captivating degree&#146;  (B. McCarthy, <span class="italic">Elizabeth Barrett to Mr Boyd</span>, 1955, 44). Price was a compulsive letter-writer, and Edward Henry Barker (1788&#150;1839) began collecting his correspondence with a view to publishing it. He wrote to Elizabeth Barrett asking for her letters, but her father, Edward, thought that to agree would be &#145;a dereliction of all I know you to feel towards the memory of Sir U. Price&#146;  (M. Forster, <span class="italic">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span>, 1988, 54).<h2>
<a name="Officeshonoursanddeath"></a>Offices, honours, and death</h2>Price was elected a member of the Society of Dilettanti in 1784 along with his lifelong friend Sir George Beaumont. He was sheriff of Herefordshire in 1793 and served upon a number of local committees, including the commission for the new county gaol in Hereford, which employed John Nash as architect in 1796. He was the first and only superintendent to the deputy surveyor of the Forest of Dean (1816). On 12 February 1828 he was created a baronet.<br>
<br>Price died at Foxley on 14 September 1829, aged eighty-two, having been predeceased by his wife, on 16 July 1826. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Hereford Journal</span> (16 September 1829) referred to his &#145;learning, his sagacity, his exquisite taste, his indefatigable ardour&#146;. He was buried against the east wall of Yazor church, in the churchyard, under a simple table tomb. It survives today, albeit in ruins.<br>
