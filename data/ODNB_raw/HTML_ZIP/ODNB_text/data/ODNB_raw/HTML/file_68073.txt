<span class="headword">Plantagenet,  Arthur</span>, Viscount Lisle  (<em>b. </em>before 1472, <em>d.</em> 1542), <span class="occ">soldier, diplomat, and administrator</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8520/', "Edward IV (1442&#150;1483)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Theyoungcourtier"></a>The young courtier</h2>The identity of Arthur's mother and his date of birth have given rise to much speculation. The editor of his correspondence, Muriel St Clare Byrne, agrees with most authorities in identifying his mother as Elizabeth Lucy, an obscure lady who was probably the daughter of Thomas Waite of Hampshire. Stories that Arthur's mother was Elizabeth (Jane) Shore or Lady Eleanor Butler can be discounted. Byrne suggests a date of birth between 1462 and 1464, but this seems unlikely for two reasons. First, it presupposes that Edward IV did not beget, or at any rate acknowledge, any illegitimate children after his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1465. Second, a fifty-year-old uncle seems an unlikely jousting companion for the young Henry VIII in the early 1510s. The first possible reference to Arthur occurs in 1472 when &#145;my Lord the Bastard&#146; is mentioned in the accounts of the royal household. This scrap suggests that Arthur may have been brought up in the royal nursery alongside Edward IV's legitimate children, who were born between 1466 and 1480.<br>
<br>Although Byrne contends that Arthur probably spent much of his childhood with his mother's family in Hampshire, it is likely that this proximity to the royal family continued into Henry VII's reign. His early life is obscured, however, by the lack of contemporary references to him. In 1501 he was probably &#145;the Bastard of King Edward's&#146; whom Henry VII recommended to his mother. By the following year, if not before, he had entered the household of his half-sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8635/', "Queen Elizabeth")</script> of York, and was listed among her household servants at her funeral in 1503. As such he was probably known to the young Prince Henry, the future Henry VIII, who was brought up in the royal nursery at Eltham Palace under the guidance of the queen's household staff. After the queen's death he was transferred to the king's household, serving as an esquire for the body. In April 1509 he made the transition to Henry VIII's household.<br>
<br>It is evident that in the first years of Henry VIII's reign Arthur Plantagenet was a close companion of the young king. In May and June 1510, along with such intimates of the king as Charles Brandon, Edmund Howard, and Thomas Knyvet, he took part in feats of arms at court. He took part in the campaigns of 1513, initially at sea, when he nearly lost his life in the shipwreck of the <i>Nicholas of Hampton</i> in February, and later in the king's invasion of France during the summer; he was dubbed a knight outside Tournai on 14 October 1513 (although he had been styled <i>miles</i> a year earlier).<h2>
<a name="Governmentservant"></a>Government servant</h2>After the French campaign, if not before, Arthur's attendance at court became more intermittent as he served the king in a variety of local and national offices. He served on the commission for the peace for Hampshire and Sussex between 1512 and 1532 and was pricked as sheriff for Hampshire in November 1513. He attended on the king at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, probably as a member of the privy chamber (he was a gentleman of the privy chamber from 1526, a position he retained until 1533). In 1522 he was with Henry when he met the emperor Charles V at Canterbury, and in April 1523 he was elected a knight of the Garter. He served as a subsidy commissioner for Hampshire in 1523&#150;4. In 1525 he was named vice-admiral of England, serving as deputy to Henry VIII's own illegitimate son, the duke of Richmond, and in the same year was made constable of Portchester Castle. In October 1527 he was among the embassy that went to present the Garter to Fran&ccedil;ois I; the same year Sir John Daunce described him as one of the king's councillors. In October 1532 he accompanied the king to Calais to meet with Fran&ccedil;ois I. This <i>cursus honorum</i> suggests that Viscount Lisle, as he became in 1523, was a competent and trusted soldier, diplomat, and administrator, certainly not the ineffectual bungler as which he has sometimes been represented.<br>
<br>It was against this background of a distinguished career in royal service that on 21 March 1533 Lisle was appointed deputy of Calais, following the death of John Bourchier, second Lord Berners. He had arrived in Calais by June. R. B. Merriman describes him as completely lacking the qualities necessary for the government of England's continental outpost, but this seems unfair. Lisle had close links with Thomas Cromwell by 1533 but his appointment to office in Calais was due to the king's personal knowledge of and confidence in his abilities. Lisle was considered to be a suitable <i>locum tenens</i> of the king in Calais by both Henry and Cromwell and as such cultivated good working relationships with neighbouring French and imperial commanders, such as Anthoine Brusset, captain of Gravelines, and Oudart du Bies, steward of Boulogne.<h2>
<a name="ProblemsatCalais"></a>Problems at Calais</h2>Lisle's time at Calais was, however, beset by difficulties. The defence and good government of the town and marches had been neglected under Henry VIII, a situation that had worsened after Wolsey's fall in 1529 and was not remedied until the reforms of the <span class="roman">Calais Act</span> of 1536 were implemented under Lord Maltravers, deputy from 1540. Nevertheless Lisle continued to fulfil the military duties of the deputy's office to the best of his ability, organizing the spy network that operated throughout Picardy, Artois, and the Low Countries (for which he received &pound;100 yearly as &#145;spyall money&#146;), and overseeing the implementation of proposals for the modernization of the Calais defences, which had first been mooted by the king in 1532. Although Lisle's letters to Cromwell on the latter issue do not necessarily imply any great personal interest or ability where the art of fortification was concerned&#151;he was probably passing on information received from William Lelegrave, the surveyor of the works at Calais&#151;they do illustrate his diligence in attending to his responsibilities. Lisle's administration was also hampered by bad relations with several of the leading townsmen and members of the garrison, notably Sir Robert Wingfield, a former deputy, and Sir Richard Whetehill.<br>
<br>Religion, too, was a major difficulty for Lisle's government of Calais. He and his wife were religious conservatives, and as such were hostile to the efforts made by Cromwell and Archbishop Cranmer (of whose diocese Calais formed part) to introduce reforming preachers and ministers to the Calais pale. The enclave had already felt the influence of evangelical reform from both France and the Low Countries in the form of printed books bought by members of the merchant community; in 1528, for instance, the chaplain of the staple was investigated by the then deputy, Lord Berners, for keeping suspicious books. In Lent 1534 these tensions were heightened when the evangelical John Butler was appointed as the archbishop's commissary, and in that year and in those that followed Lisle was to clash several times with Cranmer and Cromwell over the appointment of preachers. Religious discord erupted most violently in 1538 when Adam Damplip, an evangelical preacher whom Lisle had licensed, clashed publicly with John Dove, prior of the Calais Carmelites and one of Lisle's agents in London. The affair was referred back to England, and ended in Cromwell administering a severe rebuke to Lisle, greatly to Cranmer's satisfaction.<br>
<br>It was, however, the question of patronage, rather than religion, that dominated Lisle's time as deputy and ultimately led to his downfall. Deputies of Calais were supposed to have the nomination of soldiers in the garrison and expected to wield influence over matters of patronage in the pale. In reality, from Henry VII's reign onwards, the influence of the deputy in patronage matters had decreased as the influence of the court grew. Battles of patronage were a commonplace during Lisle's time as deputy: for example, between 1533 and 1536 when, with Cromwell's help, he prevented Sir Richard Whetehill from obtaining a place in the garrison for his son. From 1538 differences over patronage soured the relationship between Lisle and Cromwell. The latter's clients in Calais persistently undermined the deputy and council of Calais in matters of patronage and religion. Moreover, Lisle's indebtedness and Cromwell's refusal to intercede on his behalf for a licence to return to England worsened the rift between the two men. By 1538 Lisle was in frequent communication with Cromwell's aristocratic enemies at court, including Sir Anthony Browne, Sir Thomas Cheyney, and, most importantly, the duke of Norfolk.<h2>
<a name="Politicalinvolvements"></a>Political involvements</h2>Byrne believed that Lisle was &#145;not a political figure&#146;  (Byrne, 1.137). It seems likely, however, that by 1540 he was a key member of the aristocratic group ranged against Cromwell. Lisle shared a common aristocratic and martial heritage with Cromwell's enemies and probably resented Cromwell's dominance of policy and patronage in Calais, just as Norfolk and his allies resented Cromwell's dominance of the king's counsels at Westminster. That Lisle was a key figure in the opposition to Cromwell is shown by his arrest on 19 May 1540, accused of having treasonable communications, through his chaplain Gregory Botolph, with Cardinal Reginald Pole. That Lisle's arrest was part of a move against his enemies by Cromwell is shown by the fact that Richard Sampson, the conservative bishop of Chichester, and Dr Nicholas Wilson, a staunch ally of Bishop Gardiner, had followed Lisle to the Tower by the end of the month. On 10 June Cromwell himself was arrested, his treasonable dealings with heretics in Calais forming the main charge against him, and was executed on 28 July. Lisle, however, was clearly innocent of the charges brought against him. His arrest was part of a struggle for power and influence at the Henrician court, and did not form part of Henry VIII's attack on the remaining members of the house of York. Lisle remained a prisoner in the Tower until 1542 when Henry restored him to favour. In January the Garter was returned to him but when news of his release was brought to him by Thomas Wriothesley on 3 March, according to John Foxe, the excitement caused him to die of a heart attack.<br>
<br>Lord Lisle's heraldic achievements on his elevation to the Order of the Garter testify to his status and lineage. His badges were the falcon and fetterlock, on his coat he bore the leopards of England and the lilies of France, and on his standard was the lion of March. In his arms he quartered the arms of Mortimer and de Burgh and included a baton sinister, showing that although he had an unbroken male descent from Edward III he had no claim to the throne. These arms, clearly approved by Henry VIII, and Lisle's career show that he was an example of the rewards and favour open to loyal servants of the Tudor dynasty. Lisle's career also shows that the Tudors' reconciliation with the Yorkist polity did not stop at the dynastic marriage Henry VII entered into in January 1486.<h2>
<a name="Familylife"></a>Family life</h2>Lisle married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth (1482x4&#150;1525/6), daughter of Edward Grey, first Viscount Lisle, and later Baroness Lisle in her own right, and widow of Edmund Dudley. The marriage, which took place about 13 November 1511, was clearly arranged by the king and was marked by the grant to Arthur Plantagenet of forfeited Dudley lands in Lancashire, Sussex, and Dorset. They had three daughters: Frances, born <i>c</i>.1512&#150;20; Elizabeth, born <i>c</i>.1520&#150;22; and Bridget, whose birth in 1525 or 1526 probably caused the death of her mother. In 1519 Elizabeth Grey became the sole heir of the barony of Lisle, following the death of her niece Elizabeth, the fifth holder of the title, and on 12 May she and Arthur were granted the Lisle lands in Berkshire, Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Somerset, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire, and Worcestershire. It was in his wife's right that on 25 April 1523 Arthur Plantagenet was created Viscount Lisle.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_68073"></a><span class="headword">Honor Plantagenet</span>  (1493<span class="mult">x</span>5&#150;1566), Lisle's second wife, whom he married in November 1528, was the daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville of Stowe in Kilkhampton, Cornwall, and widow of Sir John Basset of Umberleigh, Devon. She had three sons and four daughters from her first marriage: Philippa, born in 1516; Katherine, born in 1517; John, born the following year; Anne, born in 1521; Mary, born <i>c</i>.1522&#150;5; George, born <i>c</i>.1522&#150;5; and James, born <i>c</i>.1526&#150;7. She had no children with Lisle, though she was rumoured to be pregnant in 1536&#150;7. She was successful both in arranging good marriages for her daughters and in furthering the education of her children by placing them in important households, both in England and France; these included those of Thomas Cromwell, Edward Seymour, and Thybault Rouaud, sire de Reion (near Abbeville). Anne became a maid of honour to Jane Seymour, while James joined the household of Bishop Gardiner in 1537. These placements may have served the further purpose of creating useful contacts and networks for her second husband, who was isolated at Calais from the main focus of political activity at court. In 1532 she went with Lord Lisle to Calais, and was one of six ladies appointed to attend upon Anne Boleyn, who had accompanied Henry VIII thither. She was careful to cultivate good relations with Anne thereafter.<br>
<br>When her husband became deputy of Calais, Lady Lisle accompanied him to the town and played an important part in the social and diplomatic engagements that were the responsibility of the deputy's wife. For Merriman, Lisle's actions were &#145;too much influenced by the whims of a foolish wife&#146;  (Merriman, 1.164), and Foxe denounces her as the &#145;utter enemy to God's honour, and in idolatry, hypocrisy, and pride, incomparably evil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5.505). In reality, although undeniably conservative in her religious views, Honor played the role of a loyal and supportive wife to her capable husband, to whom her letters show that she was devoted. She was active in maintaining Lisle's links with the court, but her priorities, in common with those of most other aristocratic women of the time, appear to have been the running of her household and provision for the education and marriage of her children. She survived her husband's death, though it left her &#145;distraught of mind&#146;  (ibid.), and died at Trehidy, Cornwall, in 1566.<br>
