<span class="headword">Bull,  George Stringer</span>  (1799&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and social reformer</span>, was born on 12 July 1799 at Stanway, Essex, the sixth child and sixth son of eight sons and two daughters of the Revd John Bull (1767&#150;1834), curate of Stanway, and his wife, Margaret Towndrow (1766&#150;1833). He joined the Royal Navy at the age of eleven and served in the Napoleonic wars. In 1816 he left the navy and went to live with his father, by now rector of Tattingstone, near Ipswich. In 1818 he sailed to Sierra Leone to work as a missionary and teacher under the auspices of the Church Missionary Society, but sickness forced him to return to England in 1820. Three years later he was ordained and became curate of Hessle, near Hull, where he met Mary Frances Coulson (1796&#150;1878), the daughter of a Hull merchant, whom he married on 5 December 1825 and with whom he had six children.<br>
<br>After moving to the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1825 Bull was initially curate of Hanging Heaton, near Dewsbury, and then, from 1826 until 1839, of Byerley (Bierley), near Bradford, where he became known as &#145;Parson Bull of Byerley&#146;. He campaigned for slave emancipation abroad and temperance at home, and from 1831, having become increasingly aware of the often appalling conditions in many Yorkshire factories, he allied himself with Michael Sadler, Richard Oastler, and John Wood in the Ten Hours Movement, which long pressed for a reduction in the working hours of children and young people. Bull laboured tirelessly in this cause, thereby earning the nickname &#145;the Ten Hours Parson&#146;. He organized and spoke at rallies and demonstrations, wrote numerous pamphlets, and was co-editor of the <span class="italic">British Labourer's Protector, and Factory Child's Friend</span> (1832&#150;3). It was he who in 1833 was largely responsible for persuading Lord Ashley, later the seventh earl of Shaftesbury, to lead the agitation for a <span class="roman">Ten Hours Act</span> in parliament. Though a firm churchman he advocated the reform of abuses in the Church of England, notably in his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Church her Own Enemy</span> (1834). He was sympathetic towards the emerging trade unions and opposed the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span> of 1834, which he regarded as a retrograde measure. However, during his later years at Byerley he drew back somewhat from public campaigning because of the growth of militant Chartism, of which he disapproved. In 1840 Bull went to Birmingham. He became perpetual curate of the newly formed district of St Matthew, Duddeston, and from 1847 rector of St Thomas's, near the Bull Ring, a parish of 30,000 people. By 1864 he was in poor health and accepted the benefice of Almeley, Herefordshire, where he died on 20 August 1865. He was buried in St Thomas's churchyard, Birmingham, on 26 August.<br>
<br>Throughout his ministry Bull, small in stature but stockily built, was an energetic and highly effective pastor, establishing numerous schools and other parochial institutions and attracting large congregations. His outspoken advocacy of social reform ensured that he was a very popular and respected figure among the working classes in industrial areas, but his uncompromising tory churchmanship and his prominence within the Ten Hours Movement led to periodic clashes with both dissenters and Liberals. In the novel <span class="italic">Michael Armstrong</span> (1840), Frances Trollope, mother of Anthony, depicts factory life in Derbyshire and introduces Bull, thinly disguised as &#145;George Bell of Fairly&#146;.<br>
