<span class="headword">Blackwall,  John</span>  (1790&#150;1881), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 20 January 1790, at 14 St Ann's Square, Manchester, the son of Thomas Blackwall, an Irish linen merchant. He initially worked in partnership with his father, but at the same time developed a keen interest in natural history. In 1821 he joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and in the same year published a note on a method of determining the &#145;mean temperature of the natural day&#146;. He then published a paper in which he developed an argument of John Gough, on the migration of birds. He wrote about fifteen papers on ornithology and a number on a variety of other subjects. In 1827 he was elected fellow of the Linnean Society, in whose <span class="italic">Transactions</span> he published his first researches on spiders, a subject he was to make his own. In 1834 his papers were collected into one volume and published as <span class="italic">Researches in Zoology</span> (2nd edn, 1873). He was married and had a son, also called John.<br>
<br>In 1833 Blackwall gave up his business career to dedicate himself entirely to his hobby. He moved to north Wales, and settled at Hendre House, Llanrwst, Denbighshire. With extraordinary dedication and skill, and with the minimum of artificial aids beyond a small lens, he fully described over 300 spiders; 67 of these were new to science. His work was set out in his <span class="italic">History of the Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1861&#150;4), which was beautifully illustrated with plates showing 272 different spiders. The work was delayed for ten years by the illness of the artist, Tiffen West, whom Blackwall curiously does not mention.<br>
<br>Blackwall continued to work until he was eighty-six, when failing eyesight compelled him to stop. He was a recluse who worked alone, unfortunately lacking colleagues in Britain and having little contact with continental scientists. He died at his home at Llanrwst, on 11 May 1881, one of the oldest members of the Linnean Society, of the Manchester &#145;Lit. and Phil.&#146;, and of the British Association.<br>
