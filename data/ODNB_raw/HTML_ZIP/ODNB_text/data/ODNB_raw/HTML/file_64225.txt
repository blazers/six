<span class="headword">Moynihan,  (Herbert George) Rodrigo</span>  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 17 October 1910 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, the elder son and elder child of Herbert James Moynihan, fruit broker, and his Spanish wife, Maria de la Puerta. His childhood and youth were peripatetic and between 1924 and 1927 he attended high school in Madison, New Jersey. In 1927&#150;8 he was once more in Europe and declared his intention to study painting. In 1928 he was enrolled as a student at the Slade School of Fine Art, University of London, where he studied under Professor Henry Tonks. A break in his progress occurred after his first year, when paternal pressure banished him to a broking office in the City; Tonks intervened on his behalf and from then onwards (he graduated in 1931) painting was his life.<br>
<br>An early cosmopolitanism in his outlook and tastes distinguished Moynihan from the run of his fellow students. At the same time there emerged characteristics of both innate conservatism and decided radicalism which were to shape the rest of his career and were marked features of his personality.<br>
<br>Moynihan first came to public notice through the exhibition &#145;Objective Abstractions&#146; held at Zwemmer's Gallery, London, in March 1934, which he shared with Geoffrey Tibble, Graham Bell, and others. His works, evolved from elements of still life, were thickly encrusted, non-figurative paintings, indebted to the later paintings of J. M. W. Turner and Claude Monet; in this, they ran counter to the prevailing geometric abstraction of, for example, Ben Nicholson or Piet Mondrian. Although the works caused interest, he received little encouragement and, by the late 1930s, he returned to representational painting and gained considerable and increasing success over the following fifteen years. He was associated with, although not a member of, the Euston Road School (1937&#150;9) through his friendship with William Coldstream, Victor Pasmore, Tibble, and Bell. Unlike them, he was not especially drawn to proletarian subject matter and his suave handling of paint and restricted colour range were distinct from, for example, those of Pasmore or Claude Rogers at that time.<br>
<br>In the 1940s Moynihan became a celebrated &#145;conservative&#146; artist known for his wartime paintings such as <span class="italic">The Medical Inspection</span> (1943; IWM) and <span class="italic">Private Clarke, ATS</span> (1943; Tate collection). He was called up in 1940, trained as a gunner, joined the camouflage section, and was invalided out after two years. He was an official war artist (1943&#150;4) and became ARA (1944). After the war he became professor of painting at the Royal College of Art, London (1948&#150;57), and in 1951 he produced his one book, <span class="italic">Goya</span>. In 1953 he was appointed CBE and in 1954 RA. It seemed he was cast in a mould all too familiar in the history of British art&#151;of brilliant early achievement followed by establishment renown. By the mid-1950s he sensed he was trapped. The renewed possibilities of abstraction, the break-up of his first marriage, and his resignation from the Royal College and the Royal Academy (both 1957) all contributed to remarkable changes in his art and his personal circumstances.<br>
<br>The painterly daring of Moynihan's early objective abstractions was harnessed to boldness of scale and dramatic colour to produce a handful of outstanding works. He was at first encouraged by the example of contemporary French <i>tachisme</i> and later by Sam Francis and American abstract expressionism, which he came to know well on several extended visits to New York in the 1960s with his second wife. It was during this period that they jointly edited (with Sonia Orwell and John Ashbery) the influential quarterly <span class="italic">Art and Literature</span> (1964&#150;8).<br>
<br>Gradually the gestural freedom and liberality of options of this phase became burdensome; a hard-edged abstraction resulted in which areas of discrete colour are enlivened by bands, chevrons, and diamonds of contrasting hues. A &#145;sense of place&#146; collides with severe geometric organization. At the same time Moynihan continued drawing from nature in the landscape near his homes in France (near Aix-en-Provence) and in Canada (New Brunswick).<br>
<br>In 1971 Moynihan resumed painting from life, chastened yet enriched by his second foray into abstraction. There then began what is perhaps his most notable contribution to painting&#151;a series of still lifes of the quotidian objects on shelf or table top in his studio. They are painted in a light but intense scheme of colour, combining utmost dexterity of handling and subtle, unfussy composition. Such qualities also inform the portraits of the 1970s and 1980s which include penetrating studies of Francis Bacon, Sir William Coldstream, Friedrich von Hayek, and Benedict Nicolson (the last two in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, as is his <span class="italic">The Rt Hon Margaret Thatcher, PM</span>, 1984). In 1979 he was re-elected to the Royal Academy, the year after his full-scale retrospective was held there. He had been honoured by a fellowship of University College, London, in 1970.<br>
<br>Moynihan's personality mixed Spanish hauteur, English conservatism, and a mercurial intellectual curiosity. He was well read and well travelled and in conduct was both confidential and secretive, sybaritic yet disciplined. Attractive, attentive, and amorous, he had several love affairs. Early good looks, Mediterranean in cast, continued to give distinction to a face he recorded in a series of perceptive self-portraits. In later years poor health diminished his activities. In painting, his place is assured by the still lifes of his last decades in which visual values alone effect a brooding and magical transformation of the oppressive material of day-to-day life.<br>
<br>On 26 November 1931 Moynihan married the painter <a href="#cosubject_64225">Elinor Bellingham Smith [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had one son. They were divorced in 1960 and in the same year he married the painter Anne Diana Wishart (<i>b</i>. 1929), divorced wife of Michael Wishart and daughter of Sir James Hamet Dunn, first baronet, industrialist. They also had one son. Moynihan died in London in his South Kensington studio on 6 November 1990.<br>
<br>Moynihan's first wife, <a name="cosubject_64225"></a><span class="headword">Elinor  Bellingham Smith</span>  (1906&#150;1988), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in December 1906, the daughter of Guy Bellingham Smith, obstetrician and registrar at Guy's Hospital, and a noted collector of drawings and prints. She trained as a ballet dancer, but injury forced her to abandon her career. She then went to the Slade School of Fine Art, where she studied under Henry Tonks and met Rodrigo Moynihan. Following their marriage she found herself at the centre of Moynihan's artistic coterie, latterly at Old Church Street, Chelsea, where she &#145;dispensed gallons of soup and not a little whisky, and supervised hilarious and crazy get-togethers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 12 Nov 1988). A painter whose style was often compared to Berthe Morisot's, she had seven shows at the Leicester Galleries, London, and was one of the prizewinners in the &#145;Sixty Paintings for '51&#146;, exhibition as part of the Festival of Britain. After the collapse of her marriage she moved to Suffolk, where despite hip trouble and ill health she painted a remarkable series of landscapes, conveying in particular the bleakness and beauty of East Anglia in winter. Her London exhibitions included those at the New Art Centre in 1972, the Fitzroy Gallery in 1980, and the New Grafton Gallery in 1987, and a retrospective at the Royal Academy in 1990. She died on 4 November 1988. Examples of her work are in the Tate Gallery, Aberdeen Municipal Gallery, Wolverhampton Municipal Gallery, Preston Municipal Gallery, and elsewhere.<br>
