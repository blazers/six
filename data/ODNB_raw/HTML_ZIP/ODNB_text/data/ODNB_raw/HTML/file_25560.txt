<span class="headword">Simeon, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1755/6&#150;1824), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized on 18 March 1756 at St Laurence's Church, Reading, the second son of Richard Simeon (<i>d</i>. 1784), attorney, of Reading, and his wife, Elizabeth Hutton. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25559/', "Charles Simeon")</script> became one of the most prominent evangelicals in the Church of England. The family were of French extraction. Simeon was educated at Eton College, which he entered in September 1765, becoming a king's scholar in 1771. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 23 October 1775, aged nineteen.<br>
<br>Having become a student of Lincoln's Inn on 12 November 1773, Simeon was called to the bar in Trinity term 1779. The same year he was elected recorder of his native town of Reading, and held that position until his resignation in 1807. He was also elected to represent the town in parliament in June 1797. On 14 June 1783 he married Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1830), the eldest daughter of John Cornwall of Hendon, Middlesex, a wealthy Russia merchant. The couple had three sons and three daughters. Simeon had estates at Walliscot and Gresley, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>In the Commons, Simeon was normally a supporter of William Pitt's government, but was not afraid to criticize some of its measures. He lost his seat in 1802, but subsequently re-established his position by means of &#145;an expensive programme of ostentatious charity and some dubious business transactions&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 175). Simeon was elected unopposed in 1806, and continued to represent Reading until 1818, when failing health forced him to retire from politics.<br>
<br>In 1789 Simeon published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Law of Elections</span>, which was well received by the profession; a second edition appeared in 1795. Simeon also proposed measures to improve knowledge of electoral law, but his action was frustrated. He was a frequent speaker on the poor laws and sat on the 1817 and 1818 select committees, but was averse to schemes of radical reform. His bill of 1800, to allow transfers of stock in equity suits, passed into law in amended form.<br>
<br>In November 1795 Simeon was appointed a master in chancery in ordinary, and discharged the duties of the office for twenty-eight years; for the last sixteen years of his life he was senior master. On 7 March 1812 he was placed at the head of the commission, composed of himself, Count M&uuml;nster, and General Herbert Taylor, for placing George III's real and personal estate in trust during his majesty's illness; this delicate business was executed without salary. He acted as a commissioner for the protection of the king's property until his majesty's death in 1820. In consideration of his services a baronetcy was conferred upon Simeon on 22 May 1815, and by royal licence on 26 May 1820 he received a grant of supporters to be borne by him and his successors in the title. On 9 July 1817 he petitioned to be called to the bench of Lincoln's Inn, but his application was not granted.<br>
<br>Sir John was described by Mary Russell Mitford as having been &#145;stationary as Southampton Buildings, solid as the doorpost, and legible as the letters on a brass plate&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 175). He died on 4 February 1824, and was succeeded as second baronet by his eldest son, Sir Richard Simeon. His wife survived him.<br>
