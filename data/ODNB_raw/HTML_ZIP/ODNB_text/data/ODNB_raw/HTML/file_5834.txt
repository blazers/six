<span class="headword">Colbatch,  John</span>  (1665&#150;1748), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and university teacher</span>, was the son of John Colbatch of Ludlow, Shropshire. He was educated at Westminster School, where he was made scholar in 1680, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a pensioner in 1683. He graduated BA (1687), MA (1690), BD (1701), and DD (1706). He became a fellow of his college in 1689 and was ordained priest in 1691. In 1693 he was appointed chaplain to the British factory at Lisbon, with a salary of &pound;200 a year. At the request of Bishop Gilbert Burnet he wrote an <span class="italic">Account of the Court of Portugal</span> (1700), which attracted promises of preferment from Burnet and from Queen Mary, and which was quickly translated into French. In 1700 he returned to England to prepare Burnet's eldest son for Trinity College, at a salary of &pound;40. In 1701, on the recommendation of Richard Bentley, Colbatch was appointed tutor to Lord Hertford, eldest son of the duke of Somerset, chancellor of Cambridge University. In 1703 Colbatch was persuaded by the duke to travel for a further two years with his pupil on the continent, at a salary of &pound;100. But at the end of the tour the duke quarrelled with Colbatch and dismissed him from his post, refusing to pay his expenses. The duke was persuaded by Bentley to retract his slurs on Colbatch but he refused to pay additional salary or to fulfil his promises of preferment. Through Burnet's patronage Colbatch held the prebend of Yatminster, at Salisbury, worth just &pound;20, from 1702 to 1720. In 1705 he returned to Cambridge, at the age of forty, impoverished and disappointed. From 1707 to 1748 he was professor of moral philosophy and his lectures brought him a great reputation; they represented the heyday of the professorship, which by 1769 held no duties. He formed friendships with many scholars, including Daniel Waterland, Ralph Thoresby, and William Whiston. He was also a donor of books to Edward Harley's collection.<br>
<br>Colbatch's residence at Trinity involved him in the feud between Richard Bentley and the fellows of the college. Initially Colbatch was a counsellor of moderation, and he published a pamphlet in defence of Bentley's contention that a BD or DD gave an MA seniority within the fellowship. He also refused to join Miller's attack on Bentley, and in 1717 he preached a sermon in the college, appealing to the religious feelings of his colleagues. He found it increasingly difficult to remain neutral in the quarrel, however. While in 1714 he refused Bentley's offer of the vice-mastership because of his lack of seniority, it sparked a long contest with him. Colbatch led the fellows in their efforts to persuade Bishop Fleetwood to prosecute Bentley. In 1719 Colbatch petitioned Archbishop Wake, Lord Sunderland, and Lord Parker and persuaded them to bring the fellows' action against Bentley before the privy council. In 1720 Colbatch sought nomination to the college living of Orwell, and Bentley hoped to force him to surrender his fellowship. But Colbatch &#145;fairly threw Bentley on his back&#146;  (Monk, 2.98) and won the dispute when the fellows supported his claim.<br>
<br>In 1720 Bentley published a pamphlet attacking Colbatch, to whom he erroneously attributed an attack upon his proposals for a new edition of the <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span>. Colbatch endeavoured to get damages in the courts for this libel but it was litigation that lasted for more than a decade and was said to have cost Colbatch over &pound;1000. In 1722 he issued a tract entitled <span class="italic">Jus academicum</span>, which attacked the failure of the vice-chancellor's court to bring Bentley to justice and sought the authority of the court of the king's bench over the university. In response Bentley brought an action against Colbatch in 1723. The judge imagined that Colbatch's attacks on Bentley were aspersions upon the king's bench and, owing partly to his own want of tact at the trial, Colbatch was fined &pound;50 and imprisoned for a week. In 1727 Bentley generously presented him with the old college clock for his church at Orwell. But Colbatch had committed himself to the battle. In 1727 he wrote to Bishop Gibson of London, denouncing the unfitness of a candidate for orders, and in doing so drew his attention to the state of Trinity College. In 1729 he published a tract entitled <span class="italic">A defence of the lord bishop of Ely's visitatorial jurisdiction over Trinity College in general, and over the master thereof in particular</span>. In 1738 his fifteen-year refusal to pay Bentley, who was also archdeacon of Ely, his fees for the living of Orwell led to a prosecution. Colbatch was defeated in the courts but denounced Bentley for failing to visit his archdeaconry, in <span class="italic">The Case of Proxies Payable to Ecclesiastical Visitors</span>.<br>
<br>Colbatch died in Cambridge on 11 February 1748. He left &pound;30 a year to a charity school at Orwell, and during his lifetime had been a considerable benefactor to the church.<br>
