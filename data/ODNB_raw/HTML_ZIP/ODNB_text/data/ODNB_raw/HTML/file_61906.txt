<span class="headword">Tomlinson,  Kenelm <span class="st"> [Kellom]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1693, <em>d.</em> in or after 1754?), <span class="occ">dancing-master and choreographer</span>, about whose birth and parentage nothing is known, was apprenticed to the respected London dancing-master Thomas Caverley from 1707 until 1714. He also studied under Ren&eacute; Cherrier of Drury Lane Theatre. Tomlinson's manuscript workbook (now in the National Library of New Zealand) records the treatises and dance repertoire that he studied as an apprentice and also contains six theatrical dances that he created for Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre in 1716 and 1721. Though there is no evidence that Tomlinson himself ever appeared on stage his writings refer to two of his students&#151;John Topham and Miss Francis&#151;who both went on to distinguished stage careers. He also wrote theatrical dances for Diane Schoolding (later Mrs Anthony Moreau), Marie Sall&eacute;, and her brother  (<span class="italic">The Submission</span>, 1716), and &#145;a New Ball Dance&#146;, which was performed on stage by M. Villeneuve and Mme Delagarde in 1743.<br>
<br>Tomlinson is best remembered for his ballroom <i>danses &agrave; deux</i> and for his treatise <span class="italic">The Art of Dancing</span>, which is now the major primary source for the study of early eighteenth-century English dance in the <i>belle danse</i> style. Six of his annual ball-dances were reissued as a set in 1720, dedicated to the &#145;Ladies, who have done Honour to this Art &hellip; by making it a Branch of Education&#146;, and for all their beauty and sophistication these dances are clearly pedagogic in intent. His treatise <span class="italic">The Art of Dancing</span>, begun in 1724, was published in 1735; its thirty-seven illustrative plates of dancers, step notation, and the entire ballroom minuet were the work of seven engravers, including Gerard Van der Gucht, George Vertue, Henry Fletcher, and George Bickham, to designs drawn by Tomlinson himself. The plates alone were considered &#145;proper Furniture for a Room or Closet &hellip; if put in Frames&#146; and sold at 2 guineas a set, plus another half guinea for the text  (<span class="italic">Art of Dancing</span>, bk 1, introduction to plates). Tomlinson's treatise is important as the most detailed description of the dance forms and steps current in England by the 1730s, as one of very few eighteenth-century manuals to describe theatrical as well as social dance, and for giving a unique insight into the circles in which Tomlinson was moving; this it achieved by naming in its subscription list 179 patrons, pupils, and professional colleagues, including 33 peers, 107 members of the gentry, and 22 of the leading dancers of the day. The work went to a second edition in 1744, which, like the first edition, was dedicated to Catherine Belasyse, Viscountess Fauconberg.<br>
<br>Tomlinson married Mary Alston of Aldgate at St Benet Paul's Wharf on 25 July 1717. No record of their having any children has been found but the marriage on 22 February 1782 of &#145;Kellom Tomlinson, Bachelor, and Mary Bestland, widow&#146; at Portsmouth  (parish register, St Mary Portsea) may indicate at least one descendant. According to Musgrave's <span class="italic">Obituary</span> Tomlinson may have died in or soon after 1754 but no burial or probate records have been found.<br>
